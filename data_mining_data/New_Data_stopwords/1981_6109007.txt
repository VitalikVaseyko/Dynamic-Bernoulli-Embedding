 Polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) suppressed hepatic fatty acid synthesis activities lipogenic enzymes effectively saturated fats. activity glycolytic enzymes--glucokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase--were affected PUFA. absolute rate liver fatty acid synthesis meal ingestion similar maximal activities acetyl-CoA carboxylase fatty acid synthetase. PUFA supplemented fat-free diet, activities carboxylase synthetase decreased similarly 3 days. 3 days, concentration liver malonyl-CoA (after meal ingestion) significantly differ fat-free PUFA dietary treatments. Apparently PUFA feeding caused coordinate decrease utilization production malonyl-CoA resulted net change malonyl-CoA pool size. Thus mechanism PUFA suppresses fatty acid synthesis appears coordinately specifically reducing amount carboxylase fatty acid synthetase.
