 Cancer cells enhance glycolysis, producing lactate, even presence oxygen. Glycolysis series ten metabolic reactions catalysed enzymes whose expression often increased tumour cells. HKII phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) mainly antiapoptotic effect; PGI glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activate survival pathways (Akt on); phosphofructokinase 1 triose phosphate isomerase participate cell cycle activation; aldolase promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition; PKM2 enhances various nuclear effects transcription, stabilisation on. review outlines multiple non-glycolytic roles glycolytic enzymes, essential promoting cancer cells' survival, proliferation, chemoresistance dissemination.
