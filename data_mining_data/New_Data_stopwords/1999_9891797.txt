 long-held belief gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis strict aerobe. recent studies shown B. subtilis grow anaerobically, either using nitrate nitrite terminal electron acceptor, fermentation. B. subtilis alters metabolic activity according availability oxygen alternative electron acceptors one focus study. two-component signal transduction system composed sensor kinase, ResE, response regulator, ResD, occupies early stage regulatory pathway governing anaerobic respiration. One essential roles ResD ResE anaerobic gene regulation induction fnr transcription upon oxygen limitation. FNR transcriptional activator anaerobically induced genes, including respiratory nitrate reductase, narGHJI.B. subtilis two distinct nitrate reductases, one assimilation nitrate nitrogen nitrate respiration. contrast, one nitrite reductase functions nitrite nitrogen assimilation nitrite respiration. Unlike many anaerobes, use pyruvate formate lyase, B. subtilis carry fermentation absence external electron acceptors wherein pyruvate dehydrogenase utilized metabolize pyruvate.
