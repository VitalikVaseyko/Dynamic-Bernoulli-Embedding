 understanding oncogenes profound effects cellular metabolism discovery mutations alterations several metabolism-related enzymes--isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarate hydratase (FH), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)--has renewed interest cancer metabolism renewed hope taking therapeutic advantage cancer metabolism. Otto Warburg observed aerobic glycolysis characteristic cancer cells. 50 years later, understand aerobic glycolysis uptake glutamine glycine allow cancer cells produce energy (ATP) nucleotides, amino acids, lipids required proliferation. Expression MYC oncogene drives increase cellular biomass facilitating proliferation. PKM2 expression cancer cells stimulates aerobic glycolysis. Among intermediary metabolism enzymes, mutations SDH occur gastointestinal stromal tumors result pseudohypoxic metabolic milieu. FH mutations lead characteristic renal cell carcinoma. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) mutations found leukemias, gliomas, prostate cancer, colon cancer, thyroid cancer, sarcomas. recently recognized oncogenic metabolic lesions may selective targets new anticancer therapeutics.
