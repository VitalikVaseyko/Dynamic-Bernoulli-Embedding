 Two basic types cancers identified &#x2013; mitochondrial dysfunction cancer cells (the Warburg effect) fibroblasts supplying energy rich metabolites cancer cell functional mitochondria (the reverse Warburg effect). Inner membrane potential functional dysfunctional mitochondria measured fluorescent dyes (e.g. Rhodamine 123) displays low high values (apparent potential), respectively, contrast level oxidative metabolism. Mitochondrial dysfunction (full function) results reduced (high) oxidative metabolism, low (high) real membrane potential, simple layer (two layers) transported protons around mitochondria, high (low) damping microtubule electric polar vibrations. Crucial modifications caused ordered water layer (exclusion zone). high oxidative metabolism one proton layer mitochondrial membrane outer rim ordered water layer. High low damping electric polar vibrations results decreased increased electromagnetic activity cancer cells normal reverse Warburg effect, respectively. Due nonlinear properties electromagnetic frequency spectra cancer cells transformed fibroblasts shifted directions corresponding power deviations resulting disturbances interactions escape tissue control. cancer cells fibroblasts reverse Warburg effect tumors display frequency shifts mutually opposite directions resulting early generalization. High oxidative metabolism conditions high aggressiveness. Mitochondrial dysfunction, gate malignancy along cancer transformation pathway, forms narrow neck could convenient cancer treatment.
