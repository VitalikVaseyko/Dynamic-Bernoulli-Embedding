 Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs group neurological disorders caused CAG repeat expansion coding region associated gene. gain insight pathogenesis SCA7 possible functions ataxin-7, examined subcellular localization ataxin-7 transfected COS-1 cells using SCA7 cDNA clones different CAG repeat tract lengths. addition diffuse distribution throughout nucleus, ataxin-7 associated nuclear matrix nucleolus. location putative SCA7 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) confirmed fusing ataxin-7 fragment normally cytoplasmic protein chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. Mutation NLS prevented protein entering nucleus. Thus, expanded ataxin-7 may carry pathogenic effects nucleus altering matrix-associated nuclear structure and/or disrupting nucleolar function.
