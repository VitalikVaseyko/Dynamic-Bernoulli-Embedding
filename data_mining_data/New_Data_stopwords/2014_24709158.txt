 legume Lupinus albus able survive low nutrient conditions due presence two specialized ground organs acquisition nitrogen phosphate, respectively.In regard, cluster roots increase phosphate uptake root nodules acquire atmospheric N(2)via biological nitrogen fixation(BNF). Although organs normally tolerate low phosphate conditions, little known physiological metabolic flexibility short-term changes phosphate supply. aim investigation therefore determine physiological metabolic flexibility organs short-term supply elevated phosphate nutrition. L. albus cultivated sand culture 4 weeks 0.1 mM phosphate supply, supplied 2 mM phosphate 2 weeks. Short-term elevated phosphate supply caused increased allocation carbon respiratory costs nodules, expense cluster root function. alteration also reflected increase nodule enzyme activities related organic acid synthesis, Phosphoenol-pyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC), Pyruvate Kinase (PK), Malate Dehydrogenase(NADH-MDH) Malic Enzyme (ME). cluster roots, elevated phosphate conditions caused decline organic acid synthesizing enzymes. Phosphate recycling via Acid Phosphatase (APase),declined nodules elevated phosphate supply, increased cluster roots. findings suggest short-term elevated phosphate supply, great degree physiological metabolic flexibility lupin nutrient acquiring structures, changes related altered physiology organs [corrected].
