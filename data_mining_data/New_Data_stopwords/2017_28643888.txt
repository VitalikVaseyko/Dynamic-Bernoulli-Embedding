 SCOPE: SlimTrym((R)) formulated product composed citrus polymethoxyflavones (PMFs), green tea extract, lychee extract. investigated effect dietary SlimTrym((R)) diet-induced obesity associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mice. METHODS RESULTS: Male C57BL/6 mice fed normal diet (ND), high fat diet (HFD) HFD containing 0.1% 0.5% SlimTrym((R)) 16 weeks. Dietary SlimTrym((R)) significantly reduced weight gain relative perigonadal, retroperitoneal, mesenteric fat weight well size adipocyte HFD-fed mice. SlimTrym((R)) supplementation also effectively diminished hepatic steatosis serum levels glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TCHO). Down-regulation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, activation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling SlimTrym((R)) adipose tissue liver may responsible observed anti-obesity effects. CONCLUSION: SlimTrym((R)) supplementation potentially diminished diet-induced obesity hepatic steatosis via regulating AMPK signaling molecules involved lipid metabolism.
