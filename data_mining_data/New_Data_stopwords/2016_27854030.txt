 adenylate kinase (AK) isoforms network plays important role intracellular energy transfer processes, maintenance energy homeostasis, major player AMP metabolic signaling circuits highly-differentiated cells. purpose, rapid sensitive method developed enables estimate directly semi-quantitatively distribution cytosolic AK1 mitochondrial AK2 localized intermembrane space, isolated cells tissue samples (biopsy material). Experiments performed isolated rat mitochondria permeabilized material, including undifferentiated differentiated neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells, HL-1 cells, isolated rat heart cardiomyocytes well human breast cancer postoperative samples. samples, presence AK1 AK2 could detected high-resolution respirometry due functional coupling enzymes ATP synthesis. eliminating extra-mitochondrial ADP excess pyruvate kinase substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, coupling AK reaction mitochondrial ATP synthesis could quantified total AK mitochondrial AK2 specific AK index. contrast creatine kinase pathway, AK phosphotransfer pathway up-regulated murine neuroblastoma HL-1 sarcoma cells malignant cells expression AK2 higher AK1. Differentiated Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells exhibited considerably higher OXPHOS capacity undifferentiated cells, associated remarkable decrease AK activity. respirometric method also revealed considerable difference mitochondrial affinity AMP non-transformed cells tumor cells.
