 Broiler chickens (Gallus gallus) genetically selected rapid growth inherently predisposed heart failure. order understand biochemical mechanisms associated deterioration heart function development congestive heart failure (CHF) fast-growing chickens, study examined several factors critical myocardial energy metabolism. Measured variables included cardiac energy substrates [creatine phosphate (CrP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), l-carnitine], activity selected cytosolic enzymes [creatine kinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27)] mitochondrial enzymes [pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH; EC 1.2.4.1), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH; EC 1.2.4.2)]. CK activities higher fast-growing CHF broilers compared slow-growing broilers (p<0.05). Cardiac LDH alpha-KGDH activities changed (p>0.05), whereas PDH activity highest (p<0.05) broilers CHF. Deterioration heart function correlated lowered cardiac ATP, CrP, l-carnitine levels (all p<0.05). Depletion high energy phosphate substrates, ATP CrP, evident fast-growing chickens developed CHF. Increased activity CK suggests cardiac energy management fast-growing broilers CHF largely depends contribution pathway regeneration ATP CrP. scenario, inadequate level CrP direct cause ATP insufficiency, whereas low cardiac l-carnitine, role fatty acid transport, likely important factor contributing shortage key substrate required synthesis cardiac ATP. insufficiencies cardiac energy substrate synthesis provide metabolic basis myocardial dysfunction chickens predisposed heart failure.
