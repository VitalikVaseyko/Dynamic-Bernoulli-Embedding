 Normal differentiated hepatocytes primarily metabolize methionine, via homocysteine synthesis, transsulfuration pathway. addition glutathione, pathway produces alpha-ketobutyrate metabolized mitochondria. low methionine conditions differentiated hepatocytes predominantly regenerate methionine homocysteine. contrast, proliferating hepatocytes liver cancer cells regenerate methionine homocysteine regardless availability methionine. propose less efficient metabolism methionine proliferating hepatocytes cancer cells adaptation "Warburg effect" is, well known phenomenon cancer cells rely aerobic glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation generate energy. observation knockout mice impaired S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) synthesis (the first step methionine metabolism) catabolism spontaneously develop fatty liver hepatocellular carcinoma, together observation administration induces apoptosis hepatoma cells prevents liver cancer support hypothesis.
