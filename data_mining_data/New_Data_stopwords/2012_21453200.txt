 AIMS: Chronic metabolic impairment oxidative stress associated pathogenesis axonal dysfunction growing number neurodegenerative conditions. investigate intertwining noxious factors, chosen mouse model adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), exhibits axonal degeneration spinal cords motor disability. disease caused loss function ABCD1 transporter, involved import degradation long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) peroxisomes. Oxidative stress due VLCFA excess appears early neurodegenerative cascade. RESULTS: study, demonstrate redox proteomics oxidative damage proteins specifically affects five key enzymes glycolysis TCA (Tricarboxylic acid) cycle spinal cords Abcd1(-) mice pyruvate kinase human X-ALD fibroblasts. also show NADH ATP levels significantly diminished samples, together decrease pyruvate kinase activities GSH levels, increase NADPH. INNOVATION: Treating Abcd1(-) mice antioxidants N-acetylcysteine alpha-lipoic acid (LA) prevents protein oxidation; preserves NADH, NADPH, ATP, GSH levels; normalizes pyruvate kinase activity, implies oxidative stress provoked VLCFA results bioenergetic dysfunction, presymptomatic stage. CONCLUSION: results provide mechanistic insight beneficial effects antioxidants enhance rationale translation clinical trials X-adrenoleukodystrophy.
