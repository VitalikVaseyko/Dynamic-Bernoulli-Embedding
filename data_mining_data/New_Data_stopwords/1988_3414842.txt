 Iguanid lizards exhibit considerable intraspecific variation several aspects muscle composition. determine relationship variation variation locomotor performance, running speeds 20 male desert iguanas (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) similar mass measured video recordings animals sprinted 4.9-m runway maintained 40 degrees C, preferred body temperature Dipsosaurus. Mean sprint speed ranged 2.2 4.2 m/s. Selected muscles animals analyzed histochemically fiber type size composition, activities citrate synthase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase measured. Muscle fiber cross-sectional areas highly correlated within individuals, three leg muscles across three fiber types, individuals could characterized possessing large small fibers relative sample mean. Activities three enzymes also covaried within individuals individual lizards could characterized possessing high low leg muscle catabolic capacity. existed significant inverse relationship fiber cross-sectional areas muscle enzyme activities individuals small muscle fibers tended higher catabolic capacities. Approximately 25-30% variation mean sprint running speed could predicted variation muscle fiber areas alone. use muscle fiber areas snout vent length independent variables multiple-regression equation explained approximately 50% sprint-running variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
