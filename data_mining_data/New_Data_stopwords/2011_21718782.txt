 key animal survive prolonged hypoxia avoid rapid decline ATP levels vital organs brain. well achieved hypoxia-tolerant animals freshwater turtles newborn animals, since animals substantially suppress metabolic levels coordinated regulation ATP-producing ATP-demanding pathways. However, animals, especially adult mammals, tolerate short period hypoxia since unable maintain constant ATP levels energy charge vital organs prolonged hypoxic exposure. Here, described special mouse model, hypoxia intolerant adult mouse gradually built ability survive prolonged hypoxia intermittent hypoxic exposures. increased ability accompanied reductions body temperature O(2) consumption well transient variations blood pCO(2), pO(2) pH. glucose energy metabolism brain mouse altered similarly reported brain hypoxic turtles. Activities phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, two rate-limiting enzymes controlling rate glycolysis decreased baseline levels short period increase. contrast, activity complex I, major enzyme complex controlling oxidative phosphorylation, kept inhibited. alterations ATP-producing pathway suggest occurrence reverse Pasteur effect, indicating animal entered hypometabolic state favoring maintenance ATP level energy charge hypoxic conditions. supporting idea, ATP levels energy charge well neuronal structures brain well preserved. study provides evidence possibility hypoxic intolerant animal build ability survive prolonged hypoxia regulation glucose energy metabolism appropriate hypoxic training, deserves investigation.
