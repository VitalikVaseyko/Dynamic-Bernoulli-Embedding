 p21-activated protein kinase-1 (Pak1) plays role insulin secretion glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production. Pak1(-/-) mice found carry defect ip pyruvate tolerance test (IPPTT), leading us speculate whether Pak1 represses hepatic gluconeogenesis. show defect IPPTT became severe aged Pak1(-/-) mice. primary hepatocytes, 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-dinaphthyldisulfide, potent inhibitor group Paks, reduced basal glucose production (GP), attenuated forskolin- glucagon-stimulated GP, attenuated stimulation forskolin expression Pck1 G6pc. addition, capacity primary hepatocytes isolated Pak1(-/-) mice GP basal level significantly lower control littermates. vitro observations imply direct effect Paks hepatocytes stimulation gluconeogenesis impairment IPPTT Pak1(-/-) mice due lack Pak1 elsewhere. Consecutive ip injection forskolin 2 weeks increased gut proglucagon expression, associated improved IPPTT aged Pak1(-/-) mice wild-type controls. addition, administration DPP-IV (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitor sitagliptin 1 week reversed defect IPPTT aged Pak1(-/-) mice, associated increased plasma GLP-1 levels. observations indicate potential role Pak1 gut/pancreas/liver axis controlling glucose disposal affirmed therapeutic application GLP-1 DPP-IV inhibitors attenuating hepatic gluconeogenesis.
