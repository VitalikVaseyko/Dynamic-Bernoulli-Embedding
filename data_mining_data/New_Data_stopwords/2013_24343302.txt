 Tumour cells primarily utilize aerobic glycolysis energy production, phenomenon known Warburg effect. mechanism well understood. tumour suppressor gene p53 frequently mutated tumours. Many tumour-associated mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins lose tumour suppressive function also gain new oncogenic functions independent wild-type p53, defined mutp53 gain function (GOF). show tumour-associated mutp53 stimulates Warburg effect cultured cells mutp53 knockin mice new mutp53 GOF. Mutp53 stimulates Warburg effect promoting GLUT1 translocation plasma membrane, mediated activated RhoA downstream effector ROCK. Inhibition RhoA/ROCK/GLUT1 signalling largely abolishes mutp53 GOF stimulating Warburg effect. Furthermore, inhibition glycolysis tumour cells greatly compromises mutp53 GOF promoting tumorigenesis. Thus, results reveal new mutp53 GOF mechanism controlling Warburg effect.
