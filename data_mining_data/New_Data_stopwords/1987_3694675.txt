 Addition 2-deoxyglucose (DG, 8 13 mM) perfusate containing 5 mM pyruvate oxidizable substrate caused gradual decline contractile function Langendorff-perfused isovolumic rat heart. Simultaneously 31P-NMR spectra showed accumulation 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (DG-6P) decrease phosphocreatine (PCr) ATP contents; inosine appeared high concentration perfusate leaving heart. Subsequent reperfusion heart DG-free solution resulted recovery contractile function PCr (to 75%), well slow decay DG-6P unchanged low level ATP (35%). correlation found tissue ATP content contractile function, expressed product developed pressure heart rate. contrast, contraction correlated tissue PCr level low ATP. data demonstrate effective contraction isovolumic heart possible substantially decreased level cytoplasmic ATP. results study accord concept ATP compartmentation cardiac cells.
