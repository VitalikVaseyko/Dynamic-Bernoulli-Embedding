 Tumour cells distinguish normal cells fermenting glucose lactate presence sufficient oxygen functional mitochondria (Warburg effect). Crabtree effect invoked explain biochemical basis Warburg effect suggesting excess glucose suppresses mitochondrial respiration. known Warburg effect Crabtree effect displayed Saccharomyces cerevisiae, growth abundant glucose. Beyond similarity, also demonstrated expression human pro-apoptotic proteins S. cerevisiae Bax p53 caused apoptosis. Here, demonstrate p53 expression S. cerevisiae (Crabtree-positive yeast) causes increase ROS levels apoptosis cells growing non-fermentable carbon sources fermentable carbon sources, feature similar tumour cells. contrast, Kluyveromyces lactis (Crabtree-negative yeast) p53 causes increase ROS levels apoptosis regardless carbon source. Interestingly, increased ROS levels apoptosis correlated increased oxygen uptake S. cerevisiae K. lactis. Based results, suggest least yeast, fermentation per se prevent escape apoptosis. Rather, Crabtree effect plays crucial role determining whether cells undergo apoptosis not.
