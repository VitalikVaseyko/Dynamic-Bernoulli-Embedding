 Stability biological activity proteins highly dependent physicochemical environment. development realistic models biological systems necessitates quantitative information response changes external conditions like pH, salinity concentrations substrates allosteric modulators. Changes variable parameters rapidly lead large numbers experimental conditions, go beyond experimental capacity research groups. implemented computer-aided experimenting framework ("robot lab assistant") allows us parameterize abstract, human-readable descriptions micro-plate based experiments variable parameters execute conventional 8 channel liquid handling robot fitted sensitive plate reader. set newly developed R-packages translates instructions machine commands, executes them, collects data processes without user-interaction. combining script-driven experimental planning, execution data-analysis, system react experimental outcomes autonomously, allowing outcome-based iterative experimental strategies. framework applied response-surface model based iterative optimization buffer conditions investigation substrate, allosteric effector, pH salt dependent activity profiles pyruvate kinase (PYK). diprotic model enzyme kinetics used model combined effects changing pH substrate concentrations. 8 parameters model could estimated single two-hour experiment using nonlinear least-squares regression. model estimated parameters successfully predicted pH PEP dependence initial reaction rates, PEP concentration dependent shift optimal pH could reproduced set manually tweaked parameters. Differences model-predictions experimental observations low pH suggest additional protonation-sites enzyme substrates critical enzymatic activity. developed framework powerful tool investigate enzyme reaction specifics explore biological system behaviour wide range experimental conditions.
