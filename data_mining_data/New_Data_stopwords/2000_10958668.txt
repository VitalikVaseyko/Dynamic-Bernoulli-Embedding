 liver, glucose induces expression number genes involved glucose lipid metabolism, e.g., encoding L-type pyruvate kinase fatty acid synthase. Recent evidence indicated role AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibition glucose-activated gene expression hepatocytes. remains unclear, however, whether AMPK involved glucose induction genes. order study role AMPK regulating gene expression, generated two mutant forms AMPK. One (alpha1(312)) acts constitutively active kinase, (alpha1DN) acts dominant negative inhibitor endogenous AMPK. used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer express mutants primary rat hepatocytes culture order determine effect AMPK activity transcription glucose-activated genes. Expression alpha1(312) increased AMPK activity hepatocytes blocked completely induction number glucose-activated genes response 25 mM glucose. effect similar observed following activation AMPK 5-amino-imidazolecarboxamide riboside. Expression alpha1DN markedly inhibited basal stimulated activity endogenous AMPK effect transcription glucose-activated genes. results suggest AMPK involved inhibition glucose-activated gene expression induction pathway. study demonstrates two mutants described provide valuable tools studying wider physiological role AMPK.
