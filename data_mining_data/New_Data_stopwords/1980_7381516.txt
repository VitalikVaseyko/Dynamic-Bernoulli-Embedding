 Determination serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity often used efforts detect carriers X-linked muscular dystrophies. recently demonstrated another serum enzyme, pyruvate-kinase (PK) may also use diagnosis patients affected variety neuromuscular disorders. evaluate usefulness assay carrier detection, comparative study serum PK CPK activity performed 74 female relatives patients affected Duchenne (DMD) Becker (BMD) muscular dystrophies. obligate carriers DMD gene, 10 14 elevated CPK's, 11 14 elevated PK's 12 14 abnormal results either two enzymes. Three 16 mothers isolated cases increased serum CPK activity 6 16 increased PK activity (7 elevation least one enzyme). preliminary data suggest use PK may enhance capability discriminate carriers X-linked recessive genes.
