 BACKGROUND: cause pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) investigated humans fawn hooded rats (FHR), spontaneously pulmonary hypertensive strain. METHODS RESULTS: Serial Doppler echocardiograms cardiac catheterizations performed FHR FHR/BN1, consomic control genetically identical except introgression chromosome 1. PAH began 20 weeks age, causing death &60 weeks. FHR/BN1 develop PAH. FHR pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) rarified reticulum hyperpolarized mitochondria reduced expression electron transport chain components superoxide dismutase-2. mitochondrial abnormalities preceded PAH persisted culture. Depressed mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production caused normoxic activation hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha), inhibited expression oxygen-sensitive, voltage-gated K+ channels (eg, Kv1.5). Disruption mitochondrial-HIF-Kv pathway impaired oxygen sensing (reducing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, causing polycythemia), analogous pathophysiology chronically hypoxic Sprague-Dawley rats. Restoring ROS (exogenous H2O2) blocking HIF-1alpha activation (dominant-negative HIF-1alpha) restored Kv1.5 expression/function. Dichloroacetate, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, corrected mitochondrial-HIF-Kv pathway FHR-PAH human PAH PASMCs. Oral dichloroacetate regressed FHR-PAH polycythemia, increasing survival. Chromosome 1 genes dysregulated FHRs relevant mitochondria-HIF-Kv pathway included HIF-3alpha (an HIF-1alpha repressor), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase-2. Like FHRs, human PAH-PASMCs dysmorphic, hyperpolarized mitochondria; normoxic HIF-1alpha activation; reduced expression/activity HIF-3alpha, cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase-2. CONCLUSIONS: FHRs chromosome 1 abnormality disrupts mitochondria-ROS-HIF-Kv pathway, leading PAH. Similar abnormalities occur idiopathic human PAH. study reveals intersection oxygen-sensing mechanisms PAH. mitochondria-ROS-HIF-Kv pathway offers new targets PAH therapy.
