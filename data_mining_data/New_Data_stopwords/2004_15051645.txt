 BACKGROUND: Drugs selectively block nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 2 enzyme activity inhibiting dimerization NOS2 monomers recently developed. METHODS RESULTS: investigate whether selective inhibition NOS2 cardioprotective, rats pretreated 2 days BBS2, inhibitor NOS2 dimerization, 15 mg/kg SC. Isolated buffer-perfused hearts treated (n=9) control (n=7) hearts subjected 20 minutes ischemia followed 60 minutes reperfusion. NOS2 protein upregulated hearts end ischemia reperfusion; NOS2 enzyme activity 60% lower hearts treated animals. treated hearts, increase end-diastolic pressure significantly attenuated end ischemia, return developed pressure reperfusion greater (P<0.05). Creatine kinase release reperfusion lower treated hearts controls (P=0.02). end ischemia reperfusion, myocardial ATP levels significantly higher treated hearts controls (P<0.05). treated hearts ischemic conditions, lactate content higher lactate/pyruvate ratio lower controls (P<0.05); GAPDH activity higher; G-3-P aldose reductase activity lower. reperfusion, treated hearts, less histological damage less apoptosis cardiac muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment BBS2, selective inhibitor NOS2, improves contractile performance, preserves myocardial ATP, reduces damage death cardiac myocytes ischemia reperfusion isolated buffer-perfused rat hearts.
