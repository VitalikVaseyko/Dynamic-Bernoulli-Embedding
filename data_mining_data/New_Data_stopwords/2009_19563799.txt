 glycolytic key regulator pyruvate kinase M2 (M2-PK PKM2) switch highly active tetrameric inactive dimeric form. transition two conformations regulates glycolytic flux tumor cells. developed specific M2-PK-binding peptide aptamers inhibit M2-PK, 96% homologous M1-PK isoenzyme. study demonstrate that, normal blood glucose concentrations, peptide aptamer-mediated inhibition M2-PK induces significant decrease population doubling (PDL rate) cell proliferation rate well increase cell size, whereas glucose restriction increase PDL cell proliferation rates decrease cell size observed. Moreover, M2-PK inhibition rescues cells glucose starvation-induced apoptotic cell death increasing metabolic activity. findings suggest M2-PK metabolic sensor regulates cell proliferation, cell growth apoptotic cell death glucose supply-dependent manner.
