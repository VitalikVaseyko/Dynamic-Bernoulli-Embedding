 Novel concepts immunometabolism support hypothesis glucose consumption also used modulate anti-tumor immune responses, favoring growth expansion specific cellular subsets defined past suppressor cells currently reborn regulatory (Treg) cells. 1920s, Otto Warburg colleagues observed tumors consumed high amounts glucose compared normal tissues, even presence oxygen completely functioning mitochondria. However, role Warburg Effect still completely understood, particularly context ongoing anti-tumor immune response. Current experimental evidence suggests tumor-derived metabolic restrictions drive cell hyporesponsiveness immune tolerance. example, several glycolytic enzymes, deregulated cancer, contribute tumor progression independently canonical metabolic activity. Indeed, control apoptosis, gene expression activation specific intracellular pathways, thus suggesting direct link metabolic switches pro-tumorigenic transcriptional programs. Focus review define specific metabolic pathways controlling Treg cell immunobiology context anti-tumor immunity tumor progression.
