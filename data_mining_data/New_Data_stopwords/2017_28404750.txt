 Members adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) family exchange ADP ATP across mitochondrial inner membrane, activity essential oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mutations dysregulation ANTs associated progressive external ophthalmoplegia, cardiomyopathy, nonsyndromic intellectual disability, apoptosis, Warburg effect. Binding partners human ANTs systematically identified. absence information prevented detailed molecular understanding assorted ANT-associated diseases, including insight disparate phenotypic manifestations. fill void, study, define interactomes two human ANT isoforms. Analogous yeast counterpart, human ANTs associate heterologous partner proteins, including respiratory supercomplex (RSC) solute carriers. evolutionarily conserved ANT-RSC association particularly noteworthy composition, thereby organization, RSCs yeast human different. Surprisingly, absence major ANT isoform modestly impairs OXPHOS HEK293 cells, indicating low levels isoforms provide functional redundancy. contrast, pharmacological inhibition OXPHOS expression function inhibits ANT-dependent ADP/ATP exchange. Thus ANTs OXPHOS machinery physically interact functionally cooperate enhance ANT transport capacity mitochondrial respiration.
