 Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) key enzyme trans-sulfuration pathway, uses L-cysteine produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Functional changes pancreatic beta cells induced endogenous H2S reported, effect CSE/H2S system pancreatic beta cell survival known. study, demonstrate H2Sat physiologically relevant concentrations induced apoptosis INS-1E cells, insulin-secreting beta cell line. Transfection INS-1E cells recombinant defective adenovirus containing CSE gene (Ad-CSE) resulted significant increase CSE expression H2S production. Ad-CSE transfection also stimulated apoptosis. two end products CSE-catalyzed enzymatic reaction, ammonium pyruvate, effects INS-1E cell apoptosis, indicating overexpression CSE may stimulate INS-1E cell apoptosis via increased endogenous production H2S. exogenous H2S (100 microM) Ad-CSE transfection inhibited ERK1/2 activated p38 MAPK. Interestingly, BiP CHOP, two indicators endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, up-regulated H2S-and CSE-mediated apoptosis INS-1E cells. suppressing CHOP mRNA expression, H2S-induced apoptosis INS-1E cells significantly decreased. Inhibition p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, inhibited expression BiP CHOP decreased H2S-stimulated apoptosis, suggesting p38 MAPK activation functions upstream ER stress initiate H2S-induced apoptosis. concluded H2S induces apoptosis insulin-secreting beta cells enhancing ER stress via p38 MAPK activation. findings may help unmask novel role CSE/H2S system regulating pancreatic functions physiological condition diabetes.
