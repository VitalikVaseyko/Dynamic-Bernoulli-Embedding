 Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) protein nature contains hypusine, unusual amino acid residue formed posttranslationally deoxyhypusine synthase deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Although eIF-5A gene essential cell survival proliferation, precise function localization eIF-5A remain unclear. study, determined subcellular distribution eIF-5A indirect immunofluorescent staining direct visualization green fluorescent protein tagged eIF-5A (GFP-eIF5A). Immunofluorescent staining formaldehyde-fixed cells showed eIF-5A present nucleus cytoplasm. nuclear eIF-5A resistant Triton extraction. Direct visualization GFP tagged eIF-5A living cells revealed whole-cell distribution pattern. However, fusion additional pyruvate kinase (PK) moiety GFP-eIF-5A precluded nuclear localization GFP-PK-eIF-5A fusion protein. Fusion GFP-PK tag three different domains eIF-5A also failed reveal nuclear localization fusion proteins, suggesting absence receptor-mediated nuclear import. Using interspecies heterokaryon fusion assay, could detect nuclear export GFP-Rev, GFP-eIF-5A. whole-cell distribution pattern eIF-5A recalcitrant treatments included energy depletion, heat shock, inhibition transcription, translation, polyamine synthesis, CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Collectively, data indicate eIF-5A gains nuclear entry via passive diffusion, undergo active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.
