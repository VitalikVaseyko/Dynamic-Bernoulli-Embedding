 Treatment rat liver-type pyruvate kinase rabbit liver cathepsin B pH 7.0 caused loss activity standard assay 0.6 mM phosphoenolpyruvate. modified enzyme exhibited 10% original activity assayed 2.0 mM substrate. detectable change subunit molecular weight enzyme occurred inactivation. addition 4 microM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activity treated enzyme restored original enzyme. Limited proteolysis enzyme cathepsin B appears enhance requirement positive effector, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
