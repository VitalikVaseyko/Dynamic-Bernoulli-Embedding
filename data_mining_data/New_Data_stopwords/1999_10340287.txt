 Reduction hepatic glucose output shown chief basis metformin's clinical benefit diabetes, balance evidence suggests reflects inhibition gluconeogenesis. Recent research hepatocyte cell cultures demonstrates increased flux pyruvate kinase metformin-treated cells. analysis conditions clinically relevant concentrations metformin inhibit gluconeogenesis hepatocyte cultures prompts hypothesis metformin potentiates allosteric activation pyruvate kinase fructose-1,6-diphosphate. model rationalizes several salient features metformin's clinical activity: ability reduce hepatic triglyceride synthesis, appetite-suppressant effect, failure induce hypoglycemia.
