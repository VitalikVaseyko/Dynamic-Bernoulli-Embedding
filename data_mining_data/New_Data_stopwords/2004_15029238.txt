 recombinant congenic mouse strains AcB55 AcB61 extremely resistant malaria (Plasmodium chabaudi AS) despite presence susceptibility alleles known Char1/Char2 resistance loci. Resistance AcB55 AcB61 controlled locus chromosome 3 (Char4) shown allelic tightly linked loss-of-function mutation pyruvate kinase (Pklr). AcB55 AcB61 show important splenomegaly prior infection caused expansion red pulp, display histological signs extramedullary erythropoiesis liver. Examination splenic cell populations flow cytometry demonstrates elevated numbers TER119-positive erythroid precursor cells (>30% total spleen cells), RNA expression studies show elevated expression erythrocyte-specific transcripts globin, transferrin receptor, Nramp2/Slc11a2 spleen strains. Hematological profiling strains consistent presence anemia evidenced low total erythrocyte counts, decreased hemoglobin, well abnormally high numbers circulating reticulocytes (15-20%). results strongly suggest mutant Pklr allele (Pklr(269A)) AcB55/61 strains causes hemolytic anemia compensated constitutive erythropoiesis, turn protects mice P. chabaudi infection. possible molecular basis Pklr protective effect discussed current investigation two strains.
