 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) common aggressive form brain tumors. GBMs, like tumors, rely relatively less mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) utilize aerobic glycolysis, metabolic shift becomes augmented hypoxia. present study, investigated physiological significance altered glucose metabolism hypoxic adaptation GBM cell line U251 two newly established primary GBMs (GBM28 GBM37). found three GBMs exhibited differential growth rates hypoxia compared normoxia. normoxia, basal expressions HIF1alpha glycolysis-associated genes, PDK1, PDK3, GLUT1, relatively low U251 GBM28, basal expressions high GBM37. hypoxia, expressions genes enhanced three GBMs. Treatment dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), induced cell death GBM28 GBM37 maintained normoxia, whereas DCA effects disappeared hypoxia, suggesting hypoxic adaptation dominated DCA effects GBMs. contrast, inhibition HIF1alpha chrysin suppressed expression PDK1, PDK3, GLUT1 markedly promoted cell death GBMs normoxia hypoxia. Interestingly, however, GBMs treated chrysin hypoxia still sustained higher viability normoxia, chrysin DCA co-treatment unable eliminate hypoxia-dependent resistance. Together, results suggest hypoxic adaptation critical maintaining viability GBMs, targeting hypoxic adaptation important treatment option GBMs.
