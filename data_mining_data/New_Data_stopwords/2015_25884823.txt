 BACKGROUND: Quantitative real-time PCR valuable tool evaluating bacterial gene expression. However, order make best use method, endogenous reference genes expression data normalisation must first identified carefully validating stability expression experimental conditions. Therefore, objective study validate eight reference genes opportunistic swine pathogen, Actinobacillus suis, grown aerobic cultures (Epinephrine) without (Aerobic) epinephrine growth medium anoxic static cultures (Anoxic), sampled exponential stationary phases. RESULTS: Using RefFinder tool, expression data analysed determine whether comprehensive stability rankings selected reference genes varied experimental design. comparing Aerobic Epinephrine cultures growth phase, pyk rpoB among stably expressed genes, analysing growth phases together, pyk remained top three rankings. comparing Aerobic Anoxic samples, proS ranked among stable genes exponential stationary phase data sets well combined rankings. analysing Aerobic, Epinephrine, Anoxic samples together, gyrA ranked consistently among top three stably expressed genes exponential stationary growth well combined rankings; rho gene ranked least stably expressed gene data set. CONCLUSIONS: Reference gene stability carefully assessed design experiment mind. study, even commonly used reference gene 16S rRNA demonstrated large variability stability depending conditions studied data analysed. previously suggested, best approach may use geometric mean multiple genes normalise qPCR results. researchers continue validate reference genes various organisms multiple growth conditions sampling time points, may possible make informed predictions genes may suitable validate given experimental design, meantime, reference genes used normalise qPCR data selected caution.
