 UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining metabolic consequences dietary iron deficiency reported elevated serum glucose concentrations iron-deficient animals. Importantly, majority findings observed using earlier version laboratory animal diet (AIN-76A) primary carbohydrate source sucrose - disaccharide known negatively impact glucose lipid homeostasis. AIN-76A diet formula improved 1993 (AIN-93) optimize animal nutrition major change substitution cornstarch sucrose. Therefore, sought examine effects iron deficiency steady-state glucose homeostasis hepatic expression glucose- lipid-related genes rats fed iron-deficient diet based either AIN-76A AIN-93 diet. METHODS: study design consisted 6 treatment groups: control (C; 40 mg Fe/kg diet), iron deficient (ID; </= 3 mg Fe/kg diet), pair-fed (PF; 40 mg Fe/kg) fed either AIN-76A AIN-93 diet 21 d. Hemoglobin hematocrit measured whole blood. Serum insulin cortisol measure ELISA. Serum glucose triacylglycerols measured standard colorimetric enzyme assays. Alterations hepatic gene expression determined real-time qPCR. RESULTS: Hemoglobin hematocrit significantly reduced ID groups compared C PF groups. Similarly, animals ID groups exhibited elevated steady-state levels blood glucose insulin, significantly decreased levels circulating cortisol compared respective PF controls. Serum triacyglycerols increased ID animals consuming AIN-76A diet. Hepatic gene expression analyses revealed ~4- 3-fold increase expression glucokinase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 mRNA, respectively, ID group either diet compared respective PF counterparts. contrast, expression lipogenic genes significantly elevated AIN-76 ID group, expression genes unaffected iron status AIN-93 ID group. CONCLUSIONS: results indicate impaired iron status sufficient alter glucose homeostasis, though alterations lipid metabolism associated ID observed animals receiving AIN-76A diet.
