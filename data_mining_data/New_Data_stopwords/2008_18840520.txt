 Since type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients nephropathy (DN+) insulin-resistant, aimed identify (new) potential molecular sites involved alterations glucose metabolism patients. examined expression glycolytic enzymes cultured fibroblasts T1DM(DN+) patients compared T1DM patients without nephropathy (DN-) controls. Pyruvate kinase (PK) activity also determined. Human skin fibroblasts grown normal glucose (6 mM). RNAs proteins analyzed, respectively, using cRNA microarray two-dimensional electrophoresis followed identification mass spectrometry. PK activity measured using spectrophotometric assay. compared controls, increases gene expression hexokinase, phosphoglucomutase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase triosephosphate isomerase found T1DM(DN+) patients, T1DM(DN-) patients. T1DM(DN+) patients, protein analysis showed altered expression three glycolytic enzymes: triosophosphate isomerase, enolase PK. addition, PK activity fibroblasts T1DM(DN+) patients lower T1DM(DN-) controls. conclusion, study reports novel alterations enzymes involved glucose metabolism may associated pathophysiology insulin resistance renal damage T1DM(DN+) patients.
