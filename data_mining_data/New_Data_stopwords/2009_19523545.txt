 question specificity elucidation exact molecular mechanism action post-transcriptional gene silencing agents two major challenges establishment therapeutics. proteomic off-target effect study (2-DE MS) combination DIGE comparing phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide oblimersen (Genasense, G3139) Bcl-2-targeting siRNA-sequence human melanoma cells showed additional off-target effects contribute apoptotic effect oblimersen. oligonucleotides transfected lipofectamine 2000, oblimersen increased apoptosis determined annexin staining caspase activity measurement. contrast highly specific siRNA, expression level number proteins found altered oblimersen treatment. Several proteins linked apoptosis stress response, among galectin-1, cofilin-1, GRP78, HSP60, nucleophosmin, peroxiredoxins, identified found down-regulated oblimersen treatment. down-regulation enolase-1 three glycolytic enzymes indicates reversion cancer-related Warburg effect. observed effects may caused phosphorothioate mediated blockage mitochondrial voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC).
