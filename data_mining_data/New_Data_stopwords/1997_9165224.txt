 Insulin mediators (inositol phosphoglycans) shown mimic insulin action vitro intact mammals, known mediator involved insulin action physiological conditions, known whether insulin resistance alters mediator profile conditions. therefore investigated effects glucose ingestion changes bioactivity serum inositol phosphoglycan-like substances (IPG) healthy men insulin resistant (obese, non-insulin-dependent diabetic) men. Two classes mediators partially purified serum glucose ingestion. first eluted anion exchange resin HCl pH 2.0, bioactivity determined activation pyruvate dehydrogenase vitro. second eluted HCl pH 1.3, bioactivity determined inhibition cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. healthy men, bioactivity pH 1.3 IPG altered glucose ingestion, whereas bioactivity pH 2.0 IPG increased approximately 120% pre-glucose ingestion value 60-240 min post-glucose ingestion (p < 0.05 vs pre-glucose). change either IPG glucose ingestion insulin-resistant group. data suggest pH 2.0 IPG plays important role mediating insulin's effect peripheral glucose utilization man physiological conditions. data show, first time, defective change bioactivity insulin mediator isolated insulin-resistant humans hyperinsulinaemia, suggesting inadequate generation/release IPGs associated insulin resistance.
