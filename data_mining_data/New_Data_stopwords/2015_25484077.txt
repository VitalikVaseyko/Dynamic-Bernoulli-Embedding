 Metformin activates PRKA SIRT1. Furthermore, autophagy induced either PRKA-MTOR-ULK1 SIRT1-FOXO signaling pathways. aimed elucidate mechanism metformin alleviates hepatosteatosis examining molecular interplay SIRT1, PRKA, autophagy. ob/ob mice divided 3 groups: one ad libitum feeding standard chow diet, one 300 mg/kg intraperitoneal metformin injections, one 3 g/d caloric restriction (CR) period 4 wk. Primary hepatocytes HepG2 cells treated oleic acid (OA) plus high glucose absence presence metformin. CR metformin significantly improved body weight glucose homeostasis, along hepatic steatosis, ob/ob mice. Furthermore, CR metformin upregulated SIRT1 expression also stimulated autophagy induction flux vivo. Metformin also prevented OA high glucose-induced suppression SIRT1 expression SIRT1-dependent activation autophagy machinery, thereby alleviating intracellular lipid accumulation vitro. Interestingly, metformin treatment upregulated SIRT1 expression activated PRKA even siRNA-mediated knockdown PRKAA1/2 SIRT1, respectively. Taken together, results suggest metformin alleviates hepatic steatosis PRKA-independent, SIRT1-mediated effects autophagy machinery.
