 BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection affects cell survival signaling pathways including cell apoptosis proliferation, considered risk factors development gastric cancer unregulated. present study, investigated effect H. pylori infection phosphorylation state 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), master kinase regulates phosphorylation Akt (also known protein kinase B, PKB) cell survival. METHODS: activity PDK-1 examined human gastric epithelial cells incubated presence absence different H. pylori strains. addition, role H. pylori type IV secretion system mechanism H. pylori effect PDK-1 activity examined. RESULTS: presence H. pylori, phosphorylation activation loop (serine 241) PDK-1 rapidly lost suggesting dephosphorylation PDK-1 target H. pylori modulate cell survival. extent dephosphorylation strain dependent H. pylori 60190 effective. H. pylori infection gastric epithelial cells resulted altered phosphorylation degradation Akt, suggesting PDK-1 dephosphorylation affects cell survival pathways thereby may contribute disease pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: propose dephosphorylation PDK-1 resulting changes Akt phosphorylation one mechanisms infection H. pylori alter balance apoptosis cell proliferation identify host molecular mechanism regulated H. pylori ultimately contributes carcinogenesis. studies therefore provide insights one mechanisms H. pylori infection contributes gastric cancer regulating activity cell survival signaling pathway.
