 Red cell enzymes, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) adenosine triphosphate (ATP), evaluated 23-mo-old boy juvenile chronic myelocytic leukemia (JCML) onset illness 6 mo later accelerated phase. activities age-dependent red cell enzymes, hexokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, elevated, concentrations red cell 2,3-DPG ATP, consistent young red cell population metabolizing increased glycolytic rate. activities non-age-dependent enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD), phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, also increased levels similar greater observed term infants. illness progressed, activity red cell G3PD increased further, phosphoglucose isomerase activity increased markedly. results consistent prior suggestion JCML represents reversion "fetal" erythropoiesis.
