 Glutaminolysis Warburg effect two noticeable metabolic features tumor cells whereas biological significance cell proliferation remains elusive. widely accepted current hypothesis tumor cells use glutamine preferred carbon source energy reducing power, used explain glutaminolysis Warburg effect. provide evidence show supplying nitrogen, carbon skeleton, underlies major biological importance glutaminolysis proliferating cells. show alternative nitrogen supplying mechanisms rescue cell proliferation glutamine-free media. Particularly, show ammonia sufficient maintain long-term survival proliferation Hep3B glutamine-free media. also observed nitrogen source restriction repressed carbon metabolic pathways including glucose utilization. Based new observations metabolic pathways well established published literature, propose alternative model cellular demand glutamate key molecule nitrogen anabolism driving force glutaminolysis proliferating cells. model suggests Warburg effect may metabolic consequence secondary nitrogen anabolism.
