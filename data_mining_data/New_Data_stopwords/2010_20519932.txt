 Cav-1 (-/-) deficient stromal cells new genetic model myofibroblasts cancer-associated fibroblasts. Using unbiased informatics analysis transcriptional profile Cav-1 (-/-) deficient mesenchymal stromal cells, identified many major signaling pathways activated loss Cav-1, conditions metabolic restriction (with low glucose media). informatics analysis suggests loss Cav-1 induces oxidative stress, mimics constitutive pseudo-hypoxic state, leading (1) aerobic glycolysis (2) inflammation tumor stromal microenvironment. occurs via activation two major transcription factors, namely HIF (aerobic glycolysis) NFkappaB (inflammation) Cav-1 (-/-) stromal fibroblastic cells. Experimentally, show Cav-1 deficient stromal cells may possess defective mitochondria, due over-production nitric oxide (NO), resulting tyrosine nitration mitochondrial respiratory chain components (such complex I). Elevated levels nitro-tyrosine observed Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells, via acute knock-down siRNA targeting Cav-1. Finally, metabolic restriction mitochondrial (complex I) glycolysis inhibitors synthetically lethal Cav-1 (-/-) deficiency mice. such, Cav-1 deficient mice show dramatically reduced mitochondrial reserve capacity. Thus, mitochondrial defect Cav-1 deficient stromal cells could drive oxidative stress, leading aerobic glycolysis, inflammation, tumor microenvironment. stromal alterations may underlie molecular basis "reverse Warburg effect", could provide key targeted anti-cancer therapies using metabolic inhibitors. direct support findings, transcriptional profile Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells overlaps significantly Alzheimer disease, characterized oxidative stress, over-production (peroxynitrite formation), inflammation, hypoxia mitochondrial dysfunction. conclude Cav-1 (-/-) deficient mice new whole-body animal model activated lethal tumor microenvironment, i.e., "tumor stroma" without tumor. Since Cav-1 (-/-) mice also established animal model profibrotic disease, current results may implications understanding pathogenesis scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) pulmonary fibrosis, also related abnormal mesenchymal stem cell function.
