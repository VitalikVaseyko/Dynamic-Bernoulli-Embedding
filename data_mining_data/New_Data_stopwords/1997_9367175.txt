 Re-feeding 24-h-starved lactating rats resulted rapid (within 0.5 h) restoration glucose uptake mammary gland slower (within 3 h) restoration fatty acid synthesis. rapid reactivation glucose uptake (82% fed value within 0.5 h re-feeding) correlated rapid reactivation 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (6-PF-1-K) glycolysis (as determined 97% decrease [fructose-6-phosphate]/[fructose-1,6-bisphosphate] ratio). could fully explained fall (29%) tissue concentration allosteric inhibitor, citrate. delayed reactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) correlated closely delayed reactivation fatty acid synthesis explained continued output pyruvate lactate within first 0.5 h re-feeding. PDH reactivation preceded reactivation acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), occur significantly 1.5 h re-feeding. ACC reactivation correlated decrease tissue concentration citrate second late phase 6-PF-1-K activation. clear important regulatory steps 6-PF-1-K, PDH ACC, reactivated asynchronously lactating mammary gland response re-feeding starved rats PDH important ACC regulation fatty acid synthesis.
