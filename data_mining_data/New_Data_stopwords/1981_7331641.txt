 Rat liver mitoplasts (inner mitochondrial membrane matrix) contain protein kinase activity. activity increases twofold addition Triton X-100. activity observed absence Triton X-100 probably exposed outer surface mitoplasts, since sensitive trypsin treatment. remaining protein kinase bound membrane fraction, presumably inside (or else hidden in) inner mitochondrial membrane. small part kinase activity found mitochondrial matrix. phosphoprotein band, partly resolved doublet, observed electrophoresis SDS-polyacrylamide gels endogeneous phosphorylation mitoplasts, inner mitochondrial membrane matrix. isolated fractions phosphorylated approximately 75% phosphoprotein found matrix, remainder inner membrane. phosphorylation doublet inhibited inhibitors pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, suggesting represents phosphorylated subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase.
