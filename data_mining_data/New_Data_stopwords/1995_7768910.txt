 Metabolic pathways intermediate metabolism maize root tips identified quantified labeling isotopic metabolic steady state using glucose labeled carbon-1, -2, -6 14C 13C. specific radioactivity amino acids 13C-specific enrichment specific carbons free glucose, sucrose, alanine glutamate measured used calculate metabolic fluxes. non-triose pathways, including synthesis polysaccharides, accumulation free hexoses, lesser extent starch synthesis, found consume 75% glucose entering root tips. cycle synthesis hydrolysis sucrose found consume 70% ATP produced respiration. comparison specific radioactivities amino acids phospholipid glycerol phosphate labeling [1-(14)C] [6-(14)C]glucose revealed operation pentose phosphate pathway. transfer label [2-(14)C]glucose carbon-1 starch glucosyl units confirmed operation pathway indicated located plastids. found consume 32% hexose phosphates entering triose pathways. remaining 68% consumed glycolysis. determination specific enrichment carbohydrate carbons -1 -6 labeling [1-(13)C]glucose indicated conversion triose phosphates back hexose phosphates transaldolase exchange contributed randomization. triose phosphates produced glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway, 60% found recycled hexose phosphates, 28% directed tricarboxylic acid cycle. 28%, two-thirds found directed pyruvate kinase branch one-third phosphoenolpyruvate branch. latter essentially anaplerotic function since little malate found converted pyruvate (malic enzyme reaction).
