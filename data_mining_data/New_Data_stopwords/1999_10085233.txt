 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) anaerobic parasitic nematode Ascaris suum free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans functionally expressed hexahistidine tags N-termini purified apparent homogeneity. recombinant PDKs (rPDKs) dimers, autophosphorylated exhibited similar specific activities A. suum pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) substrate. addition, activities PDKs activated incubation PDK-depleted A. suum muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) stimulated NADH acetyl-CoA. However, recombinant A. suum PDK (rAPDK) required higher NADH/NAD+ ratios half-maximal stimulation recombinant C. elegans PDK (rCPDK) values reported mammalian PDKs, might predicted reduced microaerobic mitochondrial environment APDK. Limited tryptic digestion rPDKs yielded stable fragments truncated C-termini (trPDKs). trPDKs retained dimeric structure exhibited substantial PDK activity A. suum E1 substrate, PDK activity activated incubation PDK-depleted A. suum PDC stimulated elevated NADH/NAD+ acetyl-CoA/CoA ratios. Direct-binding assays demonstrated increasing amounts rCPDK bound A. suum PDK-depleted PDC. additional rCPDK binding observed ratios greater 20 mol rCPDK/mol PDC. contrast, truncated rCPDK (trCPDK) exhibit significant binding PDC. Similarly, truncated form rCPDK, rCPDK1-334, generated mutagenesis, exhibited properties similar observed trCPDK. results suggest C-terminus PDK required subunit association homodimer catalysis, instead seems involved binding PDKs dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core complex.
