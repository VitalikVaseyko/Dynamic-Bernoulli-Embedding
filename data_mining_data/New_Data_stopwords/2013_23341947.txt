 Metformin used anti-diabetic drug. Metformin ameliorates insulin resistance improving insulin sensitivity liver skeletal muscle. Reduced mitochondrial content reported type 2 diabetic muscles may contribute decreased insulin sensitivity characteristic diabetic muscles. molecular mechanism behind effect metformin fully clarified inhibition complex mitochondria also activation 5'AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) reported muscle. Furthermore, AMPK activation metformin treatment associated stimulation mitochondrial function biogenesis. However, causal relationship skeletal muscle investigated. hypothesized potential effects vivo metformin treatment mitochondrial function protein expressions skeletal muscle dependent upon AMPK signaling. investigated two weeks oral metformin treatment muscle specific kinase dead alpha(2) (KD) AMPK mice wild type (WT) littermates. measured mitochondrial respiration protein activity expressions key enzymes involved mitochondrial carbohydrate fat metabolism oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial respiration, CS activity, PDH complex I-V cytochrome c protein expression reduced AMPK KD compared WT tibialis anterior muscles. Surprisingly, metformin treatment enhanced respiration AMPK KD mice thereby rescued respiration defect compared WT mice. Metformin influence protein activities expressions either WT AMPK KD mice.We conclude two weeks vivo metformin treatment enhances mitochondrial respiration mitochondrial deficient AMPK KD WT mice. improvement seems unrelated AMPK, involve changes key mitochondrial proteins.
