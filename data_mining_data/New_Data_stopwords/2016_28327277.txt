 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) rare, complex multifactorial disease pulmonary vascular remodeling plays major role ending right heart failure death. Current specific therapies PAH mainly target vasoconstriction/vasodilatation imbalance curative. Bi-pulmonary transplantation remains option patients resistant current therapies. thus crucial identify novel vascular anti-remodeling therapeutic targets. remodeling displays several properties cancer cells, especially overproliferation apoptosis resistance pulmonary vascular cells, hallmarks cancer related metabolic shift known "Warburg effect". latter characterized shift ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation low rate aerobic glycolysis. compensation, cancer cells exhibit exacerbated glutaminolysis thus resulting glutamine addiction, necessary overproliferation. Glutamine intake results glutamate production, molecule crossroads energy metabolism cancer cell communication, thus contributing cell proliferation. Accordingly, therapeutic strategies targeting glutamate production, release extracellular space membrane receptors suggested treat different types cancers, central nervous system also periphery. propose similar strategies targeting glutamatergic signaling may considered PAH, especially could affect vascular remodeling also right heart hypertrophy known involve glutaminolysis pathway. Ongoing studies aim characterize involvement glutamate pathway receptors vascular remodeling, therapeutic potential specific molecules targeting pathway.
