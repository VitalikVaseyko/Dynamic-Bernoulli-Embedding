 Using proteomics tandem bioinformatics, secretomes nonaggressive aggressive thyroid carcinoma (TC) cell lines analyzed detect potential biomarkers tumor aggressiveness. panel nine proteins, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166), tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (AXL), amyloid beta A4 protein, amyloid-like protein 2, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, pyruvate kinase isozyme M2, phosphatase 2A inhibitor (SET), protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1 (14-3-3 zeta) chosen confirm expression TC patients' sera tissues. Increased presurgical circulating levels ALCAM associated aggressive tumors (p = 0.04) presence lymph node metastasis (p = 0.018). Increased serum AXL levels associated extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.027). Furthermore, differential expression amyloid beta A4 protein, AXL, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2, SET observed TC tissues compared benign nodules. Decreased nuclear expression AXL detect malignancy 90% specificity 100% sensitivity (AUC = 0.995, p < 0.001). conclusion, proteins show potential future development serum and/or tissue-based biomarkers TC warrant investigation large cohort patients.
