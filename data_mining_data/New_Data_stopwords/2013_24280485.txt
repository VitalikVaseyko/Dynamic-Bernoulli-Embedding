 BACKGROUND: aerobic glycolysis linked unconstrained proliferation cancer, less known physiological role. metabolic program promotes tumor growth preserved genome thus unresolved. tested hypothesis aerobic glycolysis derives developmental processes regulate rapid proliferation. METHODS: performed integrated analysis metabolism gene expression cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) without Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), endogenous mitogen. analysis highlighted Hexokinase-2 (Hk2) key metabolic regulator induced Shh, studied effect conditional genetic Hk2 deletion CGNP development. crossed Hk2 conditional knockout mice transgenic SmoM2 mice develop spontaneous medulloblastoma determined changes SmoM2-driven tumorigenesis. RESULTS: show Shh phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling combine induce Hk2-dependent glycolytic phenotype CGNPs. phenotype recapitulated medulloblastoma, malignant tumor CGNP origin. Importantly, cre-mediated ablation Hk2 abrogated aerobic glycolysis, disrupting CGNP development Smoothened-induced tumorigenesis. Comparing tumorigenesis medulloblastoma-prone SmoM2 mice without functional Hk2, demonstrate loss aerobic glycolysis reduces aggressiveness medulloblastoma, causing tumors grow indolent lesions allowing long-term survival tumor bearing mice. CONCLUSIONS: investigations demonstrate aerobic glycolysis cancer derives developmental mechanisms persist tumorigenesis. Moreover, demonstrate primary tumor model anti-cancer potential blocking aerobic glycolysis targeting Hk2.See commentary article:http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/11/3.
