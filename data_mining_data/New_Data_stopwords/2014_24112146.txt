 aim present study determine potential long-term metabolic effects early nutritional programming carbohydrate utilisation adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). High-carbohydrate diets fed fish four ontogenetic stages: first-feeding stage end yolk-sac larval stage; first-feeding stage 2 yolk-sac exhaustion; yolk-sac exhaustion 3 5 d. carbohydrate stimuli significantly increased body weight first-feeding groups short term. expression genes differentially regulated early dietary intervention. high-carbohydrate diets resulted decreased plasma glucose levels adult fish. mRNA levels enzyme activities glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, alpha-amylase sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 1 up-regulated first-feeding groups. significant change mRNA levels glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) experimental group, activity G6Pase enzyme FF-5 (first feeding 2 yolk-sac exhaustion) group significantly different groups. expression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene groups significantly decreased. examined early programming range, growth performance affected. Taken together, data reported herein indicate period ranging polyculture external feeding stage important window potential modification long-term physiological functions. conclusion, present study demonstrates possible permanently modify carbohydrate digestion, transport metabolism adult zebrafish early nutritional programming.
