 African cichlid, Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae eurytopic fish exhibits high levels developmental plasticity response dissolved oxygen availability. study, F1 offspring three sites Mpanga River drainage Western Uganda characterized different dissolved oxygen (D.O.) regimes reared normoxic hypoxic conditions. 1 year, enzymes measured determine tissue metabolic capacity four different tissues: muscle, heart, brain liver. enzymes measured pyruvate kinase [PK], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], citrate synthase [CS], cytochrome C oxidase [CCO], additional two, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), examined liver only. Individuals reared hypoxia exhibited elevated levels LDH CCO heart; depressed activity levels brain CS liver CCO MDH relative normoxia-reared sibs. Results study demonstrate long-term exposure hypoxia development induce changes metabolic capacities P. multicolor. flexibility may important facilitating persistence variable and/or novel environments, face increasing global hypoxia.
