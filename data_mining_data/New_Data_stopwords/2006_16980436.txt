 glucose sensor enzyme glucokinase plays pivotal role regulation glucose-induced insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells. Activation glucokinase represents promising concept treatment type 2 diabetes. Therefore, analyzed glucokinase activation physiological interaction partner, bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) resulting effect glucose metabolism insulin-producing cells. RINm5F-GK-PFK-2/FBPase-2 cells stably overexpressing glucokinase plus islet PFK-2/FBPase-2, colocalization enzymes well elevation glucokinase activity significantly increased stimulatory glucose concentration 10 mmol/liter. RINm5F-GK-PFK-2/FBPase-2 cells showed culture condition significant increase glucose utilization ATP/ADP ratio compared RINm5F-GK cells, overexpress glucokinase. Also glucose-induced insulin secretion elevated RINm5F-GK-PFK-2/FBPase-2 cells comparison RINm5F-GK cells. Furthermore, pyruvate accumulation lactate production RINm5F-GK-PFK-2/FBPase-2 cells significantly lower 10 30 mmol/liter glucose RINm5F-GK RINm5F cells. significant improvement glucose metabolism PFK-2/FBPase-2 overexpression apparently exclusively result high glucokinase enzyme activity. Stabilization closed glucokinase conformation PFK-2/FBPase-2 may activate enzyme also improve metabolic channeling beta-cells.
