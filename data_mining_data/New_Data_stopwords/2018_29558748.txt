 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Warburg effect one main energy metabolism features supporting cancer cell growth. 20(S)-Rg3 exerts anti-tumor effect ovarian cancer partly inhibiting Warburg effect. microRNAs important regulators Warburg effect. However, microRNA regulatory network mediating anti-Warburg effect 20(S)-Rg3 largely unknown. METHODS: microRNA deep sequencing performed identify 20(S)-Rg3-influenced microRNAs SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. miR-532-3p overexpressed mimic532-3p transfection SKOV3 A2780 cells inhibited inhibitor532-3p transfection 20(S)-Rg3-treated cells examine changes HK2 PKM2 expression, glucose consumption, lactate production cell growth. Dual-luciferase reporter assay conducted verify direct binding miR-532-3p HK2. methylation status promoter region pre-miR-532-3p gene examined methylation-specific PCR. Expression changes key molecules controlling DNA methylation including DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1-3 examined 20(S)-Rg3-treated cells. DNMT3A overexpressed 20(S)-Rg3-treated cells examine influence miR-532-3p level, HK2 PKM2 expression, glucose consumption lactate production. RESULTS: Deep sequencing results showed 11 microRNAs increased 9 microRNAs decreased 20(S)-Rg3 SKOV3 cells, verified qPCR. 2-fold increase miR-532-3p found 20(S)-Rg3-treated SKOV3 cells. Forced expression miR-532-3p reduced HK2 PKM2 expression, glucose consumption lactate production SKOV3 A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition miR-532-3p antagonized suppressive effect 20(S)-Rg3 HK2 PKM2 expression, glucose consumption lactate production ovarian cancer cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed miR-532-3p directly suppressed HK2 rather PKM2. miR-532-3p level controlled methylation promoter region host gene. 20(S)-Rg3 inhibited DNMT3A expression exerted insignificant effect DNMT1, DNMT3B TET1-3. 20(S)-Rg3 reversed DNMT3A-mediated methylation promoter host gene miR-532-3p, thus elevated miR-532-3p level followed suppression HK2 PKM2 expression, glucose consumption lactate production. CONCLUSIONS: 20(S)-Rg3 modulated microRNAs exert anti-tumor effect ovarian cancer. 20(S)-Rg3 lessened DNMT3A-mediated methylation promoted suppression miR-532-3p HK2 antagonize Warburg effect ovarian cancer cells.
