 K-type pyruvate kinase purified human kidney immunoadsorbant chromatography. Monoclonal antibodies secreting hybridomas made using conventional techniques. Two clones established produced antibodies K-type cross-reacting pyruvate kinase isoenzymes, named M, L R-types. specificity monoclonal antibodies proven enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoprecipitation immunoblotting experiments. M- K-isoenzymes produced gene probably alternative splicing, differences enzymes originate one exon coding 45 amino acids (Noguchi et al. J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13807-13812 (1986]. monoclonal antibodies specific K-type denaturing conditions. Thus, likely antibodies recognize (a) continuous epitope(s), least amino acids coded K-specific exon. monoclonal antibodies could successfully used immunohistochemical studies. Neurons astrocytes brain, Kupffer cells liver, connective tissue cells vascular smooth muscle cells showed immunoreactivity. However, striated muscle cells skeletal muscle heart hepatocytes immunoreactive. types glial cells, e.g., oligodendrocytes microglia, far studied, showed reaction either.
