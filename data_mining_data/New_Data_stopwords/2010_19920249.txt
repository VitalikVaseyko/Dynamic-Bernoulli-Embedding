 New evidence suggests receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) directly phosphorylates pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), resulting reduced conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, catabolized lactate lactate dehydrogenase A. Mutation critical tyrosine Tyr(105) Phe rendered PKM2 active associated decreased cellular lactate production, increased oxygen consumption, decreased hypoxic cell proliferation relative wild-type PKM2. apparent paradoxical effect growth signaling tyrosine phosphorylation, decreases rather increases PKM2 activity, stimulates revised perspective Warburg effect. effect, describes propensity cancer cells convert glucose lactate high rate, must accommodate links among glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutamine metabolism cancer cells.
