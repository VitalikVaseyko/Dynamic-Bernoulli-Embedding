 conformational difference polypeptide chain elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu)-GTP EF-Tu-GDP studied using hydrophobic fluorescent probes. interaction EF-Tu-GDP 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) measured terms enhancement fluorescence intensity emission maximum 475 nm. EF-Tu-GDP-ANS complex converted EF-Tu-GTP-ANS complex incubation phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40], roughly 2-fold increase fluorescence intensity blue shift emission maximum 475 467 nm, indicating conformational transition protein. conformational change found reversible spectrum promptly returned EF-Tu-GDP-ANS complex upon addition excess GDP. similar change spectrum also observed aminoacyl-tRNA, deacylated tRNA, added EF-Tu-GDP-ANS complex. Measurement number binding sites gel filtration indicated EF-Tu-GTP EF-Tu-GDP bind 2.9 1.7 molecules ANS, respectively. results suggest EF-Tu-GTP conformation altered one additional binding site ANS created near site interacting aminoacyl-tRNA. Another reagent, N-(1-anilinonaphthyl-4) maleimide (ANM) covalently bound sulfhydryl group EF-Tu-GDP essential interaction aminoacyl-tRNA. binding could determined spectrofluorometrically, since reagent, nonfluorescent aqueous solution, emitted strong fluorescence upon binding sulfhydryl group, indicating marked hydrophobicity local environment. Measurements kinetics binding revealed ANM reacted rapidly sulfhydryl group EF-Tu-GTP, reaction EF-Tu-GDP proceeded sluggishly. difference reactivity sulfhydryl group essential aminoacyl-tRNA binding EF-Tu-GTP EF-Tu-GDP probably reflects conformational transition protein near active site. results, together spin-label studies previously published (Arai, Kawakita, Kaziro, Maeda, & Onishi (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 3311), demonstrate reversible conformational transition occur EF-Tu changing ligand GDP GTP.
