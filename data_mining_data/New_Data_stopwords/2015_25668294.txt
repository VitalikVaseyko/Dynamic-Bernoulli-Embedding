 present study aimed evaluate capacity common dentex (Dentex dentex) efficiently use dietary carbohydrates. So, effects different type levels carbohydrates growth performance, feed utilization, fish composition, plasma metabolites key metabolic pathways liver white muscle common dentex presented. Nine isonitrogenous (43%) isoenergetic (22 MJ kg(-1)) diets formulated combining three types, pregelatinized starch (PS), dextrin (Dx) maltodextrin (Mx), three levels (12, 18 24%) carbohydrates. Growth performance significantly influenced treatments. best feed utilization observed 18% Mx group. Higher hepatic lipid content found fish fed lower dietary carbohydrate levels. PS induced higher liver white muscle hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities compared lower values observed Mx. Malic enzyme glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase liver white muscle lower Mx group. influence dietary carbohydrates source noticeable induced carbohydrate level, glycolysis lipogenesis pathways considered. Common dentex able use properly dietary carbohydrates, although optimal dietary inclusion levels 24%. greater protein-sparing effect promoted less complex carbohydrate (maltodextrin) best feed utilization indices obtained intermediate levels inclusion (18%).
