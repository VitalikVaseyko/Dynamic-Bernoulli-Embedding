 Early juveniles crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus exposed 60 days 10 40 mg/L pure glyphosate (acid form) freshwater. Mortality 33 % highest concentration, differences molting noted among treatments. first month exposure, weight gain significantly (p < 0.05) reduced 40 mg/L group. end assay, lipid levels muscle, well protein level hepatopancreas muscle significantly (p < 0.05) reduced. results suggest long-term utilization lipid protein main energetic reserves, likely response chronic stress associated herbicide exposure. Besides, lower pyruvate kinase activity muscle suggests possible metabolic depression tissue. hemolymphatic ASAT:ALAT ratio showed higher levels control highest glyphosate concentration, indicating possible damage several tissues.
