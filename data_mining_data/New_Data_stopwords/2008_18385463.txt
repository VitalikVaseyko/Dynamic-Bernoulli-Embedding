 Prenatal alcohol exposure (EtOH) results insulin resistance rats sexes increased expression hepatic gluconeogenic genes glucose production. investigate whether hepatic insulin signaling defective, studied 3-mo-old female offspring dams given EtOH pregnancy compared pair-fed control dams. performed intraperitoneal pyruvate tolerance test, determined phosphorylation status hepatic phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), Akt, PKCzeta intravenous insulin bolus, measured mRNA vivo acetylation TRB3 (tribbles 3) PTEN (phosphatase tensin homolog deleted chromosome ten) well expression histone acetylase (HAT) PCAF (p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor), histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), HAT HDAC activities. EtOH compared pair-fed control offspring, basal pyruvate-induced blood glucose increased, insulin-induced PDK1, Akt, PKCzeta phosphorylation reduced, expression PTEN TRB3 increased acetylation status decreased association increased HDAC decreased HAT activities. Thus female adult rats prenatally exposed EtOH increased gluconeogenesis, reduced insulin signaling, increased PTEN TRB3 expression liver. addition, PTEN TRB3 hypoacetylated, contribute Akt-inhibiting activity. results suggest hepatic insulin resistance rats prenatally exposed EtOH explained, least part, increased PTEN TRB3 activity due increased gene expression reduced acetylation.
