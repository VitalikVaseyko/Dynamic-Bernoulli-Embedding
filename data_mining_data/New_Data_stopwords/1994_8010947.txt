 Antibodies raised rabbits free rat liver pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase alpha-chain shown react PDH kinase alpha-chain rat heart liver PDH complexes, purified pig heart PDH complex bovine kidney dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase-protein X-PDH kinase subcomplex. E.l.i.s.a PDHE1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase) PDH kinase developed applied assays proteins extracts rat liver rat heart mitochondria; measured immunoreactivities PDHE1 (heart > liver) PDH kinase alpha-chain (liver > heart) paralleled known differences PDH complex PDH kinase activities respectively. results e.l.i.s.a PDH kinase alpha-chain extracts rat liver mitochondria showed effects starvation increase PDH kinase activity vivo, effects dibutyryl cyclic AMP palmitate increase PDH kinase activity hepatocytes cultured vitro, due largely (> 90%) increase specific activity PDH kinase. effect, cultured hepatocytes, dibutyryl cyclic AMP increase PDH kinase activity blocked cycloheximide; effect palmitate blocked inhibitor carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Etomoxir), cycloheximide.
