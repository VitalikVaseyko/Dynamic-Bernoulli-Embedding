 Mitochondria, powerhouses cell, face two imperatives concerning biogenesis. first requirement dividing cells replicate mitochondrial content growth existing mitochondria. second dynamic regulation mitochondrial content response organismal cellular cues (e.g., exercise, caloric restriction, energy status, temperature). MYC provides clearest example programmed expansion mitochondrial content linked cell cycle. oncogene, MYC also presents intriguing questions role mitochondrial targets cancer-related phenotypes, Warburg effect MYC-dependent apoptosis.
