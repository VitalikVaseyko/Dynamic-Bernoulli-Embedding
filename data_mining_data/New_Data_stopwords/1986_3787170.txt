 Human red blood cells separated discontinuous Percoll density gradient fractions increasing density. Red cells comprising lowest highest density fractions, respectively, subsequently separated according mean cell volume (MCV) means counterflow centrifugation. activities 4 red cell age-dependent enzymes (hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) highest red cell fraction low density/large MCV, although difference red cell enzyme activities total low density fraction significant. 4 enzyme activities lowest fraction red cells high density/small MCV. relative activities enzymes high density/small MCV fraction, compared unseparated cell population, were: HK (58%), PK (49%), G6PD (53%) ASAT (28%). activities significantly lower measured total high density red cell fraction. rates lactate production low density/large MCV cells (0.89 +/- 0.15 mumol X min-1 X 10(-11) cells) approximately 3-fold higher high density/small MCV cells (0.33 +/- 0.03 mumol X min-1 X 10(-11) cells). latter value 1.8-fold lower rate lactate production total high density red cell fraction (0.59 +/- 0.14 mumol X min-1 X 10(-11) cells) is, contrast lactate production density/size fractions, insensitive phosphate metabolic stimulus. argued combination density gradient counter-flow centrifugation offers greater potential obtaining old red cell population classical red cell density centrifugation alone.
