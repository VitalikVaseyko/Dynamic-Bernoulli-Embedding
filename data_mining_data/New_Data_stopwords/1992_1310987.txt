 Genistein, isoflavone putative tyrosine kinase inhibitor, used investigate coupling insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activation four metabolic effects insulin isolated rat adipocyte. Genistein inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation concentration-dependent manner ID50 25 micrograms/ml complete inhibition 100 micrograms/ml. Genistein also prevented insulin's (10(-9) M) inhibition isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis ID50 15 micrograms/ml complete effect 50 micrograms/ml. effect genistein (25 micrograms/ml) reversed supraphysiological (10(-7) M) insulin levels. contrast, genistein 100 micrograms/ml effect insulin's (10(-9) M) stimulation either pyruvate dehydrogenase glycogen synthase activity. determined whether genistein influenced insulin receptor beta-subunit autophosphorylation tyrosine kinase substrate phosphorylation either vivo vitro anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Genistein 100 micrograms/ml inhibit insulin's (10(-7) M) stimulation insulin receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation tyrosine phosphorylation cellular substrates pp185 pp60. Also, genistein prevent insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation partially purified human insulin receptors NIH 3T3/HIR 3.5 cells phosphorylation histones activated receptor tyrosine kinase. control experiments using either NIH 3T3 fibroblasts partially purified membranes cells, genistein inhibit platelet-derived growth factor's stimulation receptor autophosphorylation. findings indicate following: (a) Genistein inhibit certain responses insulin without blocking insulin's stimulation receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation receptor kinase substrate tyrosine phosphorylation. (b) adipocytes genistein must block stimulation glucose oxidation antilipolytic effects insulin site(s) downstream insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. (c) inhibitory effects genistein hormonal signal transduction cannot necessarily attributed inhibition tyrosine kinase activity, unless specifically demonstrated.
