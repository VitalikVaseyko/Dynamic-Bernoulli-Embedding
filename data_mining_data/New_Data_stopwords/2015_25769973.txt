 Natural products compounds isolated plants, provide variety lead structures development new drugs pharmaceutical industry. interest substances increases beneficial effects human health, include antiviral, antiallergic, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, antiparasitic activities. Leishmaniasis infection caused protozoa genus Leishmania, affects mainly people live poor countries, cause chronic fever, liver problems, anemia, blood problems. Current chemotherapies disease cause side effects, ineffective. vaccines, new chemotherapeutic agents treatment leishmaniasis greatly needed. work reports enzymatic targets studied development new drugs using natural products inhibitors treatment leishmaniasis. applied ligand-based-virtual screening using Random Forest, associated structure-based-virtual screening (docking), small dataset 683 flavonoids derivatives in-house data bank select structures potential inhibitory activity pyruvate kinase, important enzyme Leishmania mexicana's energy production chemistry. computer-aided drug design studies revealed good results Leishmaniasis flavones.
