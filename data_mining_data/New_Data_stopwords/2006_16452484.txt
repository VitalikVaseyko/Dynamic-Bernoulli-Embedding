 Pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) catalyzes non-oxidative conversion pyruvate formate acetyl-CoA. PFL activating enzyme (PFL-AE) common among strict anaerobic microaerophilic prokaryotes rare among eukaryotes. proteome survey isolated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mitochondria, found several PFL-specific peptides leading identification cDNAs PFL PFL-AE, establishing existence PFL system photosynthetic algae. Anaerobiosis darkness led increased PFL transcripts little effect protein levels, determined antiserum raised C. reinhardtii PFL. Protein blots revealed occurrence PFL chloroplast mitochondria purified aerobically grown cells. Mass spectrometry sequencing C. reinhardtii mitochondrial proteins, furthermore, identified peptides phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase. phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase pathway common route ATP synthesis acetate assimilation among prokaryotes novel among eukaryotes. addition PFL pyruvate dehydrogenase, algae also expresses pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. Among eukaryotes, oxygen producer C. reinhardtii broadest repertoire pyruvate-, ethanol-, acetate-metabolizing enzymes described date, many previously viewed specific anaerobic eukaryotic lineages.
