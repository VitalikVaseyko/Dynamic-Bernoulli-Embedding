 Hibernating mammals ability decrease metabolic rate survive 6 months without food inactive state body temperatures approach 0 degrees C. hibernating 13-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), oxygen consumption holds 1/30 1/50 aroused condition heart rates low 3-10 beats/min, compared 200-300 beats/min animal active. seasonal adaptation requires metabolic shift away oxidation carbohydrates towards combustion stored fatty acids primary source energy. key element fuel switch differential expression gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase thus minimizes carbohydrate oxidation preventing flow glycolytic products tricarboxylic acid cycle. Hibernators also exploit low-temperature activity PTL (pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase) heart white adipose tissue. Lipolytic activity body temperatures associated hibernation examined using recombinant ground squirrel human PTL expressed yeast. Enzymes humans ground squirrel displayed high activity temperatures low 0 degrees C showed Q(10) = 1.2-1.5 temperature range 37-7 degrees C. studies indicate low-temperature lipolysis general property PTL require protein modifications unique mammalian cells and/or hibernating state.
