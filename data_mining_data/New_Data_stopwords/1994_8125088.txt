 study regulatory mechanism pyruvate kinase gene transcription, analyzed chromatin structure cis-acting DNA regions. Two DNase-I-hypersensitive sites detected dRLh-84 hepatoma cells, hepatocytes, coincides expression gene two types cells. sites, designated HS2 HS1, located around major transcription start site 2.9 kb downstream site, respectively. transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression assay indicated region around HS1 show activity, whereas upstream region -457 promoter activity hepatoma cells. activity lost 5'-deletion -286 -225. analysis identified cluster three cis-acting regions -279 -216, named boxes A, B C. regions independent effect, inclusion regions synergistic. regions active hepatocytes, suggesting cell-type specificity. gel mobility shift assay indicated unidentified, distinct, nuclear proteins bound three boxes. results suggest transcriptional regulation gene involves alteration chromatin structure binding proteins three cis-acting elements.
