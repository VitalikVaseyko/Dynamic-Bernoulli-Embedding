 growing body recent studies bring light important cross-talk immune response metabolism level organism whole, also level individual cells. Cellular bioenergetics functions power plant fuel cells, intermediate metabolites shown play important role modulate cellular responses. especially pathways cell metabolizes glucose recently shown influence innate adaptive immune responses, oxidative phosphorylation used resting tolerant cells, aerobic glycolysis (also termed 'Warburg effect') fueling activated cells. review address center metabolism shifts upon activation innate immune cells intermediate metabolites modulate function immune cells.
