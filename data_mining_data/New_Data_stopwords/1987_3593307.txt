 Red cell 2,3-DPG ATP levels decline rather rapidly storage result poor oxygen offloading ability post-transfusion viability respectively cells. Since steady-state levels metabolites determined relative activities key enzymes glycolysis (phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase) 2,3-DPG by-pass (2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase/phosphatase), reasoned may feasible maintain near-normal levels 2,3-DPG ATP manipulating, i.e. activating inhibiting, activities enzymes using physiological effectors either singly combination. Since pyruvate kinase strategically located glycolysis regard 2,3-DPG ATP metabolism, first elected investigate effects inhibiting enzyme red cell storage. study, first prove validity proposed concept demonstrating red cells individuals heterozygous-deficient pyruvate kinase maintain higher normal levels 2,3-DPG ATP. Moreover, demonstrate L-alanine L-phenylalanine, known inhibitors pyruvate kinase maintain higher 2,3-DPG ATP levels throughout five-week storage period. results thus confirm scientific validity proposed concept provide means improving quality and/or shelf-life stored red cells.
