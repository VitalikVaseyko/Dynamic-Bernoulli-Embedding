 stepwise synthesis thymidine triphosphate (TTP) requires kinase phosphorylation last step. pyruvate kinase (PK) using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) substrate regenerate adenosine triphosphate phosphorylate thymidine diphosphate well, chose enzyme synthesis TTP via enzymatic cascade reaction. metalloenzyme PK shows pronounced promiscuity therefore fits well conditions reaction. PK commonly used today isolated rabbit muscle. cloned expressed respective open reading frame Escherichia coli, purified, characterized His-tagged recombinant enzyme. enzyme activity optimum 37 degrees C pH range 7.4 7.8. K(M) constants conformed well isolated native enzyme adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 0.37+/-0.02 mM PEP 0.07+/-0.01 mM. recombinant enzyme shows following range substrate specificity: ADP>dADP>dGDP>dCDP>thymidine diphosphate (TDP). allows phosphorylation TDP TTP high yield (up 95%). metal ions Mg(2+) K(+) necessary full enzymatic activity. addition transition metal ions Mn(2+), Cu(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+) reduces activity. Storage enzyme -20 degrees C retains full activity.
