 photorespiratory activity mesophyll protoplasts Nicotiana plumbaginifolia clearly demonstrated presence Warburg-effect, occurrence important CO(2)-sensitive O(2) uptake effect photorespiratory inhibitors photosynthetic activity. nonsaturating dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration (0.1 millimolar), observed rate CO(2) fixation 60% lower 50% O(2) compared measured 2% O(2). Using (18)O(2) mass spectrometry, measured O(2) exchange function light intensity DIC concentration. Oxygen uptake measured CO(2) compensation point (47.4 micromoles O(2) per hour per milligram chlorophyll) three-fold higher measured saturating CO(2) concentration. Cyanide iodoacetamide, inhibitors Calvin cycle, found reduce O(2) uptake extent CO(2) saturation. conclude results major part CO(2)-sensitive O(2) uptake due photorespiration. Further, investigated effect net photosynthesis inhibitors glycolate pathway. CO(2) saturation (10 millimolar DIC), 5 millimolar aminoacetonitrile (AAN), 1 millimolar aminooxyacetate (AOA) cause significant decrease net photosynthesis. However, two inhibitors added period active photorespiration (10 minutes CO(2) compensation point 20% O(2)), observed decrease rate net photosynthesis 10 millimolar DIC measured afterward (respectively, 18 29%). inhibition appear 2% O(2), stronger 50% O(2) (40% AAN 47% AOA). 0.05 millimolar butyl 2-hydroxy-3-butynoate (BHB) 0.5 millimolar l-methionine-dl-sulfoximine (l-MSO), rates net photosynthesis 10 millimolar DIC decreased 10 15%. Additional decreases observed period CO(2) compensation point 20% O(2) (30% BHB 20% l-MSO). sites action four inhibitors tested, suggest inhibition photosynthesis occurring period active photorespiration due toxic accumulation nonmetabolized phosphoglycolate.
