 double-blind crossover field study performed investigate effects acute L-carnitine supplementation metabolism performance endurance-trained athletes marathon run. Seven male subjects given supplements 2 g L-carnitine 2 h start marathon run 20 km run. plasma concentration metabolites hormones analysed 1 h before, immediately 1 h run, well next morning run. addition, respiratory exchange ratio (R) determined end run, submaximal performance test completed treadmill morning run. administration L-carnitine associated significant increase plasma concentration analysed carnitine fractions (i.e. free carnitine, short-chain acylcarnitine, long-chain acylcarnitine, total acid soluble carnitine, total carnitine) caused significant change marathon running time, R, plasma concentrations carbohydrate metabolites (glucose, lactate, pyruvate), fat metabolites (free fatty acids, glycerol, beta-hydroxybutyrate), hormones (insulin, glucagon, cortisol), enzyme activities (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase). Moreover, difference result submaximal performance test morning run. conclusion, acute administration L-carnitine affect metabolism improve physical performance endurance-trained athletes run alter recovery.
