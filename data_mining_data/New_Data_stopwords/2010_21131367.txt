 Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine produced T(h)17 cells plays important role inflammatory autoimmune diseases cancer. Stimulation IL-6, transforming growth factor-beta , IL-21, IL-1beta IL-23 required differentiation T(h)17 cells production IL-17A. Recently, reported tumor-derived lactic acid enhances toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-mediated expression IL-23, leading increased IL-17A production. Tumor cells secrete large amounts lactic acid due up-regulation glycolysis, known Warburg effect. Even without TLR ligand stimulation, lactic acid enhanced antigen-dependent IL-17A production splenocytes IL-23-dependent manner. Here, show macrophages effector/memory CD4(+) cells primary cell types involved ability lactic acid boost IL-17A production. Although lactic acid suppressed proliferation T(h)1 T(h)17 cells, T(h)17 cells still secreted large amounts IL-17A. CD40 ligand-CD40 interactions involved up-regulation IL-17A lactic acid IL-12/23p40 production. new cytokine containing IL-12/23p40 subunit, IL-23, IL-12 IL-12p40 homodimer, candidate involvement up-regulation IL-17A. IL-1beta also increased IL-17A expression; however, IL-1beta, CARD9 MyD88 signaling pathways activated known intrinsic inflammatory mediators hardly required enhanced activity induced lactic acid. results show lactic acid functions intrinsic inflammatory mediator activates IL-23-dependent -independent pathways, resulting promotion chronic inflammation tumor microenvironments.
