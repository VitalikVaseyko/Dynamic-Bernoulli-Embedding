 Glycolysis one main pathways carbon catabolism Bacillus subtilis. Although biochemical activity glycolytic enzymes studied detail, information expression glycolytic genes far available organism. Therefore, transcriptional analysis glycolytic genes performed. genes cggR, gapA, pgk, tpi, pgm eno, encoding enzymes required interconversion triose phosphates, transcribed hexacistronic operon demonstrated Northern analysis. gapA operon repressed regulator CggR. presence sugars amino acids synergistically results induction gapA operon. transcriptional start site upstream cggR mapped primer extension. Transcripts originating upstream cggR processed near 3' end cggR. endonucleolytic cleavage leads differential stability resulting processing products: monocistronic cggR message rapidly degraded, whereas mRNA species encoding glycolytic enzymes exhibit much higher stability. additional internal constitutive promoter identified upstream pgk. Thus, gapA strongly regulated gene operon. pfk pyk operon encoding phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase weakly induced glucose. contrast, genes pgi fbaA, coding phosphoglucoisomerase fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, constitutively expressed.
