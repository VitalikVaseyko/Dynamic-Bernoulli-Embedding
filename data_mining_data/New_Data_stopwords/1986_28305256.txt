 paper reported example extensive developmental changes isoenzymes controlling biochemical pathway: half glycolytic enzymes grasshopper,Caledia captiva differ electrophoretic phenotype embryonic adult stages. similar pattern changes found taxa ofC. captiva, actually species complex. present example developmental variation differs described glycolytic enzymes vertebrates two main points. Firstly, changes phenotypes embryos adults co-incident time, occurring near hatching. Secondly, contrast vertebrates embryospecific isoenzymes rare, exist inC. captiva isoenzymes trehalase, glucosephosphate isomerase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase found embryo adult. variable enzymes also exhibit tissue specificity adult. existence changes, whatever basis, shows theory expression housekeeping genes developmentally invariant generally correct.
