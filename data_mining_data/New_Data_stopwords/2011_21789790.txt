 Warburg effect describes circumstance tumor cells preferentially use glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation energy production. reported metabolic reconfiguration originates switch expression alternative splice forms (PKM1 PKM2) glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK), also important malignant transformation.However, analytical evidence assumption still lacking. Using mass spectrometry, performed absolute quantification PKM1 PKM2 splice isoforms 25 human malignant cancers, 6 benign oncocytomas, tissue matched controls, several cell lines. PKM2 prominent isoform analyzed cancer samples cell lines. However, PKM2 dominance result change isoform expression, since PKM2 also predominant PKM isoform matched control tissues. unaffected kidney, lung, liver, thyroid, PKM2 accounted minimum 93% total PKM, 80% - 96% PKM colon,and 55% - 61% PKM bladder. Similar results obtained panel tumor non-transformed cell lines, PKM2 predominant form.Thus, results reveal exchange PKM1 PKM2 isoform expression cancer formation occurring, results support conclusions PKM2 specific proliferating, PKM1 non-proliferating tissue.
