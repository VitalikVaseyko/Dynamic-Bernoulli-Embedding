 replication, hepatitis C virus (HCV) utilizes macromolecules produced host cell. process requires host cellular metabolic reprogramming favor elevated levels aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, evaluated whether pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), mitochondrial enzyme promotes aerobic glycolysis, regulate HCV replication. Levels c-Myc, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), PDK1, PDK3, glucokinase, serine biosynthetic enzymes compared HCV-infected uninfected human liver Huh-7.5 cells infected without HCV. Protein mRNA expression c-Myc, HIF-1alpha, glycolytic enzymes significantly higher HCV-infected human liver hepatocytes uninfected controls. increase accompanied upregulation serine biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting cellular metabolism altered toward facilitated nucleotide synthesis essential HCV replication. JQ1, c-Myc inhibitor, dichloroacetate (DCA), PDK inhibitor, decreased expression glycolytic serine synthetic enzymes HCV-infected hepatocytes, resulting suppressed viral replication. Furthermore, co-administered IFN-alpha ribavirin, DCA inhibited viral replication. summary, HCV reprograms host cell metabolism favor glycolysis serine biosynthesis; mediated, least part, increased PDK activity, provides surplus nucleotide precursors. Therefore, blocking PDK activity might therapeutic benefits HCV replication.
