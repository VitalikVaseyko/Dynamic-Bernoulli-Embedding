 BACKGROUND: animal studies, diabetes shown induce changes gene expression key regulators cardiac energy metabolism calcium homeostasis. present study, tested hypothesis metabolic gene expression nonischemic failing hearts diabetic patients differs nonischemic failing hearts nondiabetic patients. METHODS RESULTS: Left ventricular tissue obtained nonfailing hearts (n=6) nonischemic failing hearts patients without type 2 diabetes. Myocardial transcript levels key regulators energy substrate metabolism (glucose transporter 1, glucose transporter 4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, muscle carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, uncoupling protein 3), calcium homeostasis (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase [SERCA2a], phospholamban, cardiac ryanodine receptor), contractile function (myosin heavy chain alpha) measured using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. addition, measured myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) SERCA2a protein levels. MEF2C regulated transcripts (glucose transporter 4, SERCA2a, myosin heavy chain alpha) lower diabetic group compared nondiabetic group. MEF2C protein content also decreased. CONCLUSION: MEF2C MEF2C-regulated genes decreased failing hearts diabetic patients. transcriptional mechanism may contribute contractile dysfunction heart failure patients diabetes.
