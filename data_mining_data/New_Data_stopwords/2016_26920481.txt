 Glycerol major by-product biodiesel industry. study report metabolic networks involved transformation pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ATP. nutritionally-versatile Pseudomonas fluorescens exposed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mineral medium glycerol sole carbon source, microbe reconfigured metabolism generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) primarily via substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP). alternative ATP-producing stratagem resulted synthesis copious amounts PEP pyruvate. production metabolites mediated via enhanced activities enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (PC) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). high energy PEP subsequently converted ATP aid pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PEPS) pyruvate kinase (PK) concomitant formation pyruvate. participation phospho-transfer enzymes like adenylate kinase (AK) acetate kinase (ACK) ensured efficiency O2-independent energy-generating machinery. increased activity glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) stressed bacteria provided necessary precursors fuel process. H2O2-induced anaerobic life-style fortuitously evokes metabolic networks effective pathway harnessed synthesis ATP, PEP pyruvate. bioconversion glycerol pyruvate offer interesting economic benefit.
