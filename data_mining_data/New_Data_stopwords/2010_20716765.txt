 thymus serves primary site lifelong formation new lymphocytes; hence, essential maintenance effective immune system. Although thymocyte development widely studied, mechanisms involved incompletely defined. comprehensive understanding molecular events control regular thymocyte development shed light physiological control cell differentiation also probably provide insight pathophysiology cell immunodeficiencies, molecular basis underpins autoimmunity, mechanisms instigate formation cell lymphomas. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) play critical role thymocyte development, although downstream mediators yet identified. Here, discuss experimental evidence argues critical role PI3K-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1)-protein kinase B (PKB) signaling pathway development normal malignant thymocytes, highlight molecules potentially targeted therapeutically.
