 report shows Salmonella enterica catabolizes ethanolamine acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA), enters glyoxylate bypass tricarboxylic acid cycle generation energy central metabolites. growth ethanolamine, S. enterica excreted acetate, whose recapture depended Ac-CoA synthetase (Acs) housekeeping phosphotransacetylase (Pta) enzyme activities. Pta enzyme play role acetate excretion growth S. enterica ethanolamine. proposed growth ethanolamine, acetate excretion necessary maintain pool free CoA. Acetate excretion requires eut operon-encoded phosphotransacetylase (EutD) acetate kinase (Ack) enzymes. EutD function required growth ethanolamine, eutD strain showed slight reduction growth rate. existence as-yet-unidentified system releases acetate revealed growth strain lacking Acs, housekeeping phosphotransacetylase (Pta), EutD. functions pyruvate oxidase (PoxB), Ack STM3118 protein [a homologue Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ac-CoA hydrolase (Ach1p) enzyme] involved release acetate acs pta eutD strain.
