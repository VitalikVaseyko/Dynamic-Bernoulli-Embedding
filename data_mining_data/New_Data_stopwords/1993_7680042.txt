 1. Cells ventricles newborn rats cultured 8 days flasks attached rocker apparatus ensure adequate oxygen supply. 2. rocked cultures, previously found low lactate subsensitive positive chronotropic action beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (ISO; EC50 (+/-)-ISO around 7 x 10(-7) M), became resensitized even highly supersensitive catecholamine upon treatment 3 mM L(+)-lactate 1 mM pyruvate. 3. resulting concentration-response curves anomalous extended 8 log units, threshold 10(-13) M, little change height position maximum (at 10(-5) M). EC50 values 95% confidence intervals 2.4 (1.9-3.0) 5.4 (4.9-6.0) x 10(-11) M, respectively, lactate- pyruvate-induced components chronotropic response (+/-)-ISO. 4. supersensitive portion ISO concentration-response curve abolished (-)-propranolol (10(-6) M), indicating due beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. 5. cultured heart cells incubated L(+)-lactate pyruvate minimum 45 min increase sensitivity ISO became apparent. latency due requirement protein synthesis. 6. adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response ISO noticeably altered lactate, (+/-)-ISO, 10(-8) effect activation state cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), caused significant increase activity enzyme following 2-h exposure cells 3 mM L(+)-lactate. 7. alpha-cyanocinnamate, inhibitor transmembrane transport lactate pyruvate, severely inhibited utilization L-[U-14C] lactate cultured cells concentration (5 microM) eliminated lactate-evoked potentiation chronotropic action ISO without significantly affecting unpotentiated action. 8. beat-accelerating action phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX) lipophilic N6,2'-O-dibutyryl derivative cAMP (dbcAMP), capable elevating myocardial cAMP levels, potentiated 1 mM pyruvate. 9. question raised, whether accumulation lactate, biochemical hallmark anaerobiosis, might factor catecholamine-triggered events occurring acute myocardial ischaemia infarction.
