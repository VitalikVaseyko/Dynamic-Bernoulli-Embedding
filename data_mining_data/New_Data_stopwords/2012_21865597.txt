 Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) major Na(+) transporter intestine. Serum- glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK) 1 interacts NHE regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) mediates activation NHE3 dexamethasone (Dex) cultured epithelial cells. study, compared short-term regulation NHE3 Dex SGK1-null NHERF2-null mice. comparison wild-type mice, loss SGK1 NHERF2 significantly attenuated regulation NHE3 Dex completely obliterate effect. show transfection SGK2 SGK3 PS120 cells resulted robust activation NHE3 Dex. However, unlike SGK1 SGK2, SGK3 rapidly activated NHE3 within 15 min Dex treatment PS120 Caco-2bbe cells. Immunofluorescence analysis showed SGK3 colocalized NHE3 recycling endosomes, whereas SGK1 SGK2 diffusely distributed. Mutation Arg-90 SGK3 disrupted endosomal localization SGK3 delayed NHE3 activation. Activation SGK3 NHE3 Dex dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), Dex induced translocation PDK1 endosomes. study identifies SGK3 novel endosomal kinase acutely regulates NHE3 PI3K-dependent mechanism.
