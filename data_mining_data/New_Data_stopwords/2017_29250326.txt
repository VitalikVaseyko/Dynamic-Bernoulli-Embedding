 Otto Warburg observed 1924 cancer cells dependent exclusively glycolysis production energy even presence oxygen (the 'Warburg effect'). Consequently, cancer cells require ~19 times glucose uptake obtain equivalent amounts energy normal cells. Warburg effect scientific basis positron emission tomography (PET), markedly improved cancer detection. chemotherapy, cancer cells may upregulate expression multi-drug resistance proteins ultimately cause treatment failure. multi-drug resistance proteins require energy operate, present report evaluated potential clinical efficacy lowering blood glucose insulin chemotherapy patient advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma multiple metastases. 64-year-old male admitted Department Medical Oncology Changzhou Tumor Hospital (Changzhou, China) due irritating cough multiple bone pain. PET/computed tomography (CT) F-18 fluorodeoxy glucose (18F-FDG) identified multiple hypermetabolic foci right hilum, right upper lung, shoulder blades, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar, sacrum, bilateral iliac crest pelvis. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging detected multiple metastases brain. patient received 56 repeat treatments insulin induce hypoglycemia combined reduced doses chemotherapy 8-month period. treatment, insulin 0.2 U/kg body weight injected intravenously (i.v.), blood glucose level reached 2.5-3.0 mmol/l, navelbine (10 mg), cisplatin (10 mg) fluorouracil (250 mg) injected (i.v.) period ~10 min. patient's blood glucose level returned normal immediately chemotherapy i.v. injection 20 ml 50% glucose solution. 8-month chemotherapy regimen, patient received two PET/CT follow-ups. results demonstrated levels 18F-FDG uptake lesions reduced. addition, patient exhibited improved appetite weight gain, reduced cough, less pain. levels tumor markers, namely carcinoembryonic antigen, carcinoma antigen 15-3, CYRA21-1, neuron-specific enolase, also declined gradually. results suggest controlled, mild hypoglycemia may safely combined low dose chemotherapy provide clinical benefit advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
