 shift cellular energy production oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) glycolysis, even aerobic conditions, called Warburg effect, feature solid tumors. activity levels OXPHOS complexes citrate synthase determined astrocytomas. gradual decrease citrate synthase OXPHOS complexes observed depending tumor grade. low-grade astrocytomas (WHO grade II), enzyme activities citrate synthase, complex I, complex V comparable normal brain tissue. trend reduced activities observed complexes II-IV. glioblastoma (WHO grade IV), activities citrate synthase complexes I-IV decreased 56-92% compared normal brain. Immunohistochemical staining porin revealed tumorpil low-grade astrocytomas displays characteristics mitochondria-rich neuropil normal brain tissue. high-grade tumors (WHO grades III IV), tumorpil characterized severe morphologic alterations well loss "pilem" structures. Specific alterations OXPHOS complexes observed astrocytic tumors immunohistochemical analysis: 80% astrocytomas exhibited severe deficiency complex IV; complex showed gradual reduction amount increasing tumor grade, whereas complex II showed reduced levels high-grade (WHO grade IV) tumors (9/12); complexes III V show significant alterations compared normal brain tissue. OXPHOS defects present cell bodies tumor cells also pilem structures, indicating ramifications/protuberances (tumorpil) general originate tumor cells.
