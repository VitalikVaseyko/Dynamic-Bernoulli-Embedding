 Cancer cell metabolism exemplified high glucose consumption lactate production. Pyruvate kinase (PK), catalyzes final step glycolysis, emerged potential regulator metabolic phenotype. M2 isoform PK (PKM2) highly expressed cancer cells. However, mechanisms PKM2 coordinates high energy requirements high anabolic activities support cancer cell proliferation still completely understood. Current research elucidated novel regulatory mechanisms PKM2, contributing important role cancer. review summarizes current understanding explores future directions field, highlighting controversies regarding activity specificity PKM2 cancer. light knowledge, potential therapeutic implications strategies critically discussed.
