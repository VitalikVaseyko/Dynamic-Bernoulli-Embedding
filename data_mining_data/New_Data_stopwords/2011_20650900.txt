 anoxygenic green sulfur bacteria (GSBs) assimilate CO(2) autotrophically reductive (reverse) tricarboxylic acid (RTCA) cycle. organic carbon sources, acetate pyruvate, assimilated phototrophic growth GSBs, presence CO(2) HCO(3)(-). established inorganic carbonis required incorporating organic carbon growth organic carbons assimilated. report, probed carbon flux autotrophic mixotrophic growth GSB Chlorobaculum tepidum. data indicate following: (a) RTCA cycle active autotrophic mixotrophic growth; (b) flux pyruvate acetyl-CoA low acetyl-CoA synthesized RTCA cycle acetate assimilation; (c) pyruvate largely assimilated RTCA cycle; (d) acetate assimilated via RTCA well oxidative (forward) TCA (OTCA) cycle. OTCA cycle revealed herein may explain better cell growth mixotrophic growth acetate, energy generated OTCA cycle. Furthermore, genes specific OTCA cycle either absent down-regulated phototrophic growth, implying OTCA cycle complete, CO(2) required RTCA cycle produce metabolites TCA cycle. Moreover, CO(2) essential assimilating acetate pyruvate CO(2)-anaplerotic pathway pyruvate synthesis acetyl-CoA.
