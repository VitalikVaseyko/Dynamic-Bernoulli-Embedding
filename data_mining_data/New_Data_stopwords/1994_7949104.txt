 identified four distinct point mutations homozygous pyruvate kinase (PK) variants Japanese Chinese patients chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. gene abnormalities missense mutations caused single amino acid substitutions. 1261A (Q421K) 1436A (R436H), identified PK Sendai PK Shinshu, found unrelated Japanese Amish PK variants, respectively. clinical severity extremely low residual erythrocyte PK activity PK Shinshu well Amish PK might caused partly aberrant splicing, 1436A mutation changes nucleotide last nucleotide exon 10. Recently, diagnosed 42-year-old Japanese woman chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia homozygous PK deficiency. DNA sequencing variant PK gene showed homozygous missense mutation 1403GCT-->GTT, resulting single amino acid substitution 468la-->Val. gene mutation likely impair allostericity enzyme, speculated tertiary structure. homozygous missense mutation PK Hong Kong, boy non-Han southern Chinese minority group, identified exon 7 human L-PK gene, 941ATT-->ACT, resulting single amino acid substitution 314lle-->Thr. R-PK activity expected severely affected, mutated amino acid residue located 313 Lys 315 Glu, important acid-base catalysis magnesium binding, respectively. R- M2-type PK shown polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PK Hong Kong erythrocyte lysate, first report homozygous individual whose erythrocytes contain immature (M2)-type isozyme.
