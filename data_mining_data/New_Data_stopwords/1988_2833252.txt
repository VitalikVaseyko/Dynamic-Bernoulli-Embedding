 Glucagon's effect placenta studied cultured human term trophoblast homogenized term first-trimester placentas. studies cultured term trophoblast, glucagon stimulated generation cyclic AMP estradiol secretion inhibited placental lactogen secretion. Incubation homogenates term first-trimester placenta 0.5 mM dibutyryl cAMP revealed marked decrease pyruvate kinase activity. Glucagon produced similar decrease first-trimester homogenates, failed affect term placentas. present demonstration placenta target tissue glucagon suggests active contribution trophoblast energy metabolism pregnancy.
