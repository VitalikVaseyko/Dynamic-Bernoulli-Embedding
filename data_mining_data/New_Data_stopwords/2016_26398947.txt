 Neuroblastoma characterized wide range clinical manifestations associated poor prognosis amplification MYCN oncogene high expression Myc oncoproteins. previous vitro study, found glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) could suppress growth neuroblastoma cells, particularly MYCN amplification. study, established mouse model neuroblastoma xenografts SK-N-DZ SK-N-AS cells treated 2DG intraperitoneal injection twice week 3 weeks 100 500 mg/kg body weight. found 2DG effective suppressing growth MYCN-amplified SK-N-DZ MYCN-non-amplified SK-N-AS neuroblastoma xenografts, associated downregulation HIF-1alpha, PDK1 c-Myc, reduction number tumor blood vessels. vitro study showed 2DG suppress proliferation, cause apoptosis reduce migration murine endothelial cells, inhibition formation lamellipodia filopodia disorganization F-actin filaments. results suggest 2DG might simultaneously target cancer cells endothelial cells neuroblastoma xenografts mice regardless status MYCN amplification, providing potential therapeutic opportunity use 2DG glycolytic inhibitors treatment patients refractory neuroblastoma.
