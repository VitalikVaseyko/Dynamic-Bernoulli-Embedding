 hypoglycemia septic shock due peritonitis indicates deranged carbohydrate metabolism. determine metabolic failure could attributed changes glucoregulatory enzymes glycolytic intermediates, activities changes substances septic shock studied rats. Liver tissue sampled 5 hours induction peritonitis cecal incision fasted male rats. Hepatic glycolytic intermediates assayed UV-spectrophotometry. Peritonitis caused 33% decrease glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), 2.5 fold increase fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) 3.5 fold increase lactate. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) levels show significant increase peritonitis. investigated activities glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase), phosphofructokinase ( PFKase ) pyruvate kinase ( PKase ) mitochondria-free supernatants rat liver homogenates. Tissue sampled 5 hours induction peritonitis cecal incision. Assays conducted optimal substrate levels pH 7.4; NADH charges produced coupled reactions determined UV-spectrophotometry. significant increase PFKase PKase specific activity observed. changes consistent stimulated glycolysis. gluconeogenesis achieve maximum efficiency would necessary inhibit PFKase PKase completely.
