 Studies ATP effects allosteric kinetics shown pyruvate kinase Phycomyces blakesleeanus NRRL 1555 (-) reported. Phosphoenolpyruvate showed allosteric ATP-dependent substrate inhibition. results supported existence spatially distinct catalytic binding sites inhibitory binding sites phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP showed opposite heterotropic effects respect two types binding site. respect Mg2+ ions, ATP caused negative heterotropic effect. global inhibitory effect ATP agreement predictions postulated two-state concerted-symmetry model Monod, Wyman Changeux.
