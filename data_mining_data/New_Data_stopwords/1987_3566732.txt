 Pyruvate kinase (PK) four isozymes (L,R,M1,M2) encoded mainly two different genes. isolated cDNA clone Japanese adult liver lambda gt10 cDNA library using rat liver(L)-type PK cDNA probe. One positively hybridizing clone, hlPK-1, contained 1,049-base pair cDNA insert, subjected DNA sequence analysis. Comparisons sequence data rat PK cDNAs indicated cDNA encoded information carboxyl terminal 105 amino acids human L-type PK 3' untranslated region 734 nucleotides. Furthermore, karyotype analysis several human-mouse hybrid cells Southern blot analysis DNAs hybrids hlPK-1 indicated human L-type PK gene located chromosome 1.
