 new adenine nucleotide analog, [3H]pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (PLP-AMP), synthesized. effectiveness PLP-AMP affinity probe tested using number nucleotide-binding enzymes. comparison reaction pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, PLP-AMP binds tightly exhibits greater specificity labeling enzymes tested. PLP-AMP potent inhibitor yeast alcohol dehydrogenase rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, complete inhibition obtained upon incorporation 1 mol reagent/mol catalytic subunit. reagent also potent inhibitor yeast hexokinase phosphoglycerate kinase. modified absence substrates, enzymes require 2 mol reagent/mol active site complete inhibition. However, modified presence sugar substrates, stoichiometry decreases 1.1 hexokinase-glucose complex 1.4 phosphoglycerate kinase . 3-phosphoglycerate complex. potent inhibition PLP-AMP observed rabbit muscle adenylate kinase. Half-maximal inhibition obtained concentration approximately 1 microM. contrast examples, PLP-AMP, well pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, fails act potent specific inhibitor beef heart mitochondrial F1-ATP-ase. high specificity labeling ability nucleotide substrates decrease rate inactivation kinases dehydrogenase consistent modification active site residues. complete reversibility modification inactivation absence reduction NaBH4 absorption spectra modified enzymes prior following reduction indicate reaction lysyl residues. conclude PLP-AMP holds considerable promise affinity label exploring structure mechanism nucleotide-binding enzymes.
