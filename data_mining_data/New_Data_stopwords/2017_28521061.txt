 STUDY QUESTION: extracellular cAMP involved regulation signalling pathways bovine sperm capacitation? SUMMARY ANSWER: Extracellular cAMP induces sperm capacitation activation different signalling pathways involve phospholipase C (PLC), PKC/ERK1-2 signalling increase sperm Ca2+ levels, well soluble AC cAMP/protein kinase (PKA) signalling. KNOWN ALREADY: order fertilize oocyte, ejaculated spermatozoa must undergo series changes female reproductive tract, known capacitation. correlates number membrane metabolic modifications include increased influx bicarbonate Ca2+, activation soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) produce cAMP, PKA activation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation development hyperactivated motility. previously reported cAMP efflux Multidrug Resistance Protein 4 (MRP4) occurs sperm capacitation pharmacological blockade inhibits process. Moreover, supplementation incubation media cAMP abolishes inhibition leads sperm capacitation, suggesting extracellular cAMP regulates crucial signalling cascades involved process. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Bovine sperm selected wool glass column method, washed centrifugation BSA-Free Tyrode's Albumin Lactate Pyruvate (sp-TALP). Pellets resuspended diluted treatment. vitro capacitation, 10 15 x 106 SPZ/ml incubated 0.3% BSA sp-TALP 38.5 degrees C 45 min different experimental conditions. evaluate role extracellular cAMP different events associated sperm capacitation, 10 nM cAMP added incubation medium well different inhibitors enzymes associated signalling transduction pathways: U73122 (PLC inhibitor, 10 muM), Go6983 (PKC inhibitor, 10 muM), PD98059 (ERK-1/2 inhibitor, 30 muM), H89 KT (PKA inhibitors, 50 muM 100 nM, respectively), KH7 (sAC inhibitor, 10 muM), BAPTA-AM (intracellular Ca2+ chelator, 50 muM), EGTA (10 muM) Probenecid (MRPs general inhibitor, 500 muM). addition, assays binding oviductal epithelial cells IVF carried test effect cAMP compared known capacitant agents heparin (60 mug/ml) bicarbonate (40 mM). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Straws frozen bovine semen (20-25 x 106 spermatozoa/ml) kindly provided Las Lilas, CIALE CIAVT Artificial Insemination Centers. methods used work include western blot, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, computer-assisted semen analysis, live imaging Ca2+ fluorescence scanning. least three independent assays bull samples proven fertility carried. MAIN RESULTS ROLE CHANCE: present study, elucidate molecular events induced extracellular cAMP. results showed external cAMP induces sperm capacitation, depending upon action PLC. Downstream, enzyme increased ERK1-2 activation PKC elicited rise sperm Ca2+ levels (P < 0.01). Moreover, extracellular cAMP-induced capacitation also depended activity sAC PKA, increased tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating nucleotide exerts broad range responses. addition, extracellular cAMP-induced sperm hyperactivation concomitantly increased proportion spermatozoa high mitochondrial activity (P < 0.01). Finally, cAMP increased vitro fertilization rate compared control conditions (P < 0.001). LARGE SCALE DATA: None. LIMITATIONS, REASONS CAUTION: vitro study performed bovine cryopreserved spermatozoa. Studies species fresh samples needed extrapolate data. WIDER IMPLICATIONS FINDINGS: findings strongly suggest important role extracellular cAMP regulation signalling pathways involved acquisition bull sperm fertilizing capability. data presented indicate rise, also regulation cAMP levels necessary ensure sperm fertilizing ability. Thus, exclusion nucleotide extracellular space might essential guarantee achievement cAMP tone, needed capacitation-associated events take place. Moreover, ability cAMP trigger broad complex signalling events allows us hypothesize cAMP self-produced autocrine/paracrine factor, supports emerging paradigm spermatozoa compete but, fact, communicate other. precise understanding functional competence mammalian spermatozoa essential generate clinical advances treatment infertility development novel contraceptive strategies.
