 procedure Malhotra Kayastha ([1990] Plant Physiology 93: 194-200) purification homogeneity phosphoenolpyruvate-specific alkaline phosphatase (PEP phosphatase) germinating mung beans (Vigna radiata) followed. Although higher specific activity 1.4 micromoles pyruvate produced per minute per milligram protein obtained, final preparation less 10% pure judged polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Attempts purify enzyme resulted loss activity. partially purified enzyme contained significant pyruvate kinase activity (0.13 micromole pyruvate produced per minute per milligram protein) assayed pH 7.2, pH 8.5. PEP phosphatase activity final preparation exhibited hysteresis; lag time 5 6 minutes required steady-state reaction rate attained. western blot final preparation revealed immunoreactive 57 kilodalton polypeptide probed monospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared germinating castor bean cytosolic pyruvate kinase. antigenic cross-reaction final preparation observed antibodies castor bean leucoplast pyruvate kinase, black mustard PEP-specific acid phosphatase. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis final preparation resulted single PEP phosphatase activity band; band excised subjected sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis western blotting, 57 kilodalton silver-staining polypeptide obtained strongly cross-reacted anti-(cytosolic pyruvate kinase) immunoglobulin G. suggested mung bean PEP-specific alkaline phosphatase activity due cytosolic pyruvate kinase, pyruvate ortho-phosphate formed absence ADP.
