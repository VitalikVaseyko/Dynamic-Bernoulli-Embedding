 schistosomal parasite plays critical role development malignant lesions different organs. pathogenesis cancer currently intense investigation identify reliable prognostic indices disease detection. objective paper evaluate certain biochemical parameters diagnostic tools efficiently differentiate colonic carcinoma colonic carcinoma associated schistosomal infection among Egyptian patients. parameters investigation interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, tissue telomerase, pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activities. results revealed significant elevation level tumour markers IL-2, TNF-alpha CEA well activities LDH, telomerase G-6-PD among non-bilharzial bilharzial colonic cancer groups, potent effect bilharzial infection-associated colonic cancer. significant inhibition PK activity recorded manner compared normal tissues. efficacy biomarker also evaluated detecting sensitivity, specificity, negative positive predictive values. conclusion, schistosomal colonic carcinoma patients displayed drastic changes parameters investigation. combination selected parameters succeeded serving biomarkers differentiate two malignant types.
