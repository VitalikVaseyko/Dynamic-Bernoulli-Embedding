 adaptations freshwater turtle permit survival despite prolonged loss mitochondrial ATP generation investigated comparing bioenergetics turtle brain slices rat brain slices. Aerobic turtle brain shows significant difference basal levels total ATP generation compared rat brain; levels turtle brain rat brain 18.4 +/- 2.8 (SD) 19.4 +/- 2.2 mumol (100 mg tissue)-1 hr-1, respectively. However, turtle brain, significantly greater fraction ATP derived glycolysis aerobic anaerobic conditions [aerobic turtle (24%) rat (13%), P less 0.02; anaerobic, turtle (28%) rat (18%), P less 0.05]. increased glycolytic capacity related high levels rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). Turtle brain operates close glycolytic capacity even aerobic conditions, Pasteur effect demonstrated. Quantitatively, anaerobic glycolysis accounts maximum 28% basal aerobic ATP generation, suggesting prolonged diving also accompanied reduction brain energy requirements. adaptation subserving short-term (natural) diving increase brain glycolytic capacity. adaptation subserving prolonged diving (days weeks) may reduction energy requirements brain (and cells).
