 study utilizes 2D-DIGE (difference gel etrophoresis), isotope-coded protein labeling biochemical assays characterize protein alteration ulcerative colitis (UC) Crohn's disease (CD) human epithelial cell mucosal biopsies inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-affected patients. aim study identify key molecular signatures involved epithelial cell structure IBDs. non-inflamed UC (QUC) keratins, vimentin, focal adhesion kinase (7) increased, whereas vinculin de-tyrosinated alpha-tubulin decreased; inflammation (IUC) exacerbated molecular changes, collagen type VI alpha 1 chain (COL6A1), tenascin-C vimentin increased. non-inflamed CD (QCD), tenascin C, de-tyrosinated alpha-tubulin, vinculin, FAK, Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) decreased vimentin increased. inflamed CD (ICD), COL6A1, vimentin integrin alpha 4 increased. QUC, cell metabolism characterized decrease tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes decrease short/branched chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, fatty acid synthase, proliferator-activated receptors alpha, proliferator-activated receptors gamma. QCD metabolic rewiring occurs, suggested glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD2), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 3, 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase increment, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase decreased. Macroautophagy activated QUC IUC, increased levels p62, HSC70, major vault protein, myosin heavy chain 9, whereas blunted QCD ICD. differing pattern extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal derangements, cellular metabolism, autophagy UC CD may contribute pathophysiological understanding disorders serve diagnostic markers IBD patients.
