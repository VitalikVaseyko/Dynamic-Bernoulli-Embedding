 possible role metabolic systems producing acetyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA initial precursors biosynthesis macrolide antibiotic 6599 Streptomyces hygroscopicus JA 6599 studied. activities pyruvate decarboxylase exceeded two higher producing strains twofold found mycelium lower producing one suggesting organism enhanced production acetyl-CoA one prerequisites necessary improved antibiotic biosynthesis. clear interrelationship established, however, biosynthesis secondary metabolite 6599 one hand acetate propionate kinase content hand. S. hygroscopicus JA 6599 carboxylation acetyl-CoA propionyl-CoA seems major pathway giving malonyl-CoA methylmalonyl-CoA, respectively. Thus, activities acetyl-CoA propionyl-CoA carboxylases corresponded levels antibiotic production several strains variations observed specific antibiotic production rate cultivation. pathways synthesizing precursors, e.g. via oxaloacetate, assumed negligible since even mycelium lower producing strain increased activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase present.
