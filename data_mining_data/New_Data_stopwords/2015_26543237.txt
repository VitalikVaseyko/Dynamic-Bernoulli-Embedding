 Glucose fermentation glycolysis even presence oxygen (Warburg effect) common feature cancer cells increasingly considered enticing target clinical development. study aimed analyze link metabolism, energy stores proliferation rates cancer cells. found cell proliferation, evaluated DNA synthesis quantification, correlated glycolytic efficiency six cancer cell lines well isogenic cancer cell lines. investigate link glycolysis proliferation, pharmacological inhibitor pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) used. demonstrated reduction PPP activity decreases cancer cells proliferation, profound effect Warburg-phenotype cancer cells. crucial role PPP sustaining cancer cells proliferation confirmed using siRNAs glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, first rate-limiting enzyme PPP. addition, found dichloroacetate (DCA), new clinically tested compound, induced switch glycolytic cancer cells oxidative phenotype decreased proliferation. demonstrating DCA decreased activity PPP, provide new mechanism DCA controls cancer cells proliferation.
