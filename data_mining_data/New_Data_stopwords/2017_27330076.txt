 Drug resistance one main causes colon cancer recurrence. However, understanding underlying mechanisms availability therapeutic options remains limited. show expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) positively correlated drug resistance colon cancer cells induced 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment drug-resistant drug-sensitive cells. Knockdown PDK4 expression sensitizes colon cancer cells 5-FU oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis vitro increases effectiveness 5-FU inhibition tumor growth mouse xenograft model vivo addition, demonstrate first time TGFbeta mediates drug resistance regulating PDK4 expression 5-FU induces PDK4 expression TGFbeta signaling-dependent manner. Mechanistically, knockdown inhibition PDK4 significantly increases inhibitory effect 5-FU expression anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 survivin. Importantly, studies patient samples indicate expression PDK4 phosphorylation Smad2, indicator TGFbeta pathway activation, show strong correlation positively associate chemoresistance colorectal cancer. findings indicate TGFbeta/PDK4 signaling axis plays important role response colorectal cancer chemotherapy. major implication studies inhibition PDK4 may considerable therapeutic potential overcome drug resistance colorectal cancer patients, warrants development PDK4-specific inhibitors.
