 Intramitochondrial substrate metabolism examined cultured neuroblastoma NB41A3 cells exposed endotoxin order elucidate possible causes changes [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] [NAD+]/[NADH] reported us previously cells [1]. Flux pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), measured [1-14C]-pyruvate, inhibited 54% within 10 min endotoxin-treated cells (0.99 nmol/min/mg dry wt vs 0.46 nmol/min/mg dry wt). contrast, flux 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, measured [1-14C]-glutamate unaltered (0.79 nmol/min/mg dry wt). Dichloroacetate, inhibitor PDH kinase, restored flux PDH control levels. endotoxin-treated cells, 44% total PDH complex active (nonphosphorylated) form compared 72% control cells. Equilibrium uptake studies 45Ca2+ atomic absorption measurements showed intracellular [Ca2+] endotoxin-treated cells 20% lower control cells. postulated binding endotoxin plasma membrane triggers sequence events lead initial decline intracellular calcium concentration latter event may responsible inhibition PDH phosphatase consequent conversion complex inactive phosphorylated form.
