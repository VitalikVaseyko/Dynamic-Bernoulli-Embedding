 glutathione S-transferase (GST) system useful increasing protein solubility purifying soluble GST fusion proteins. However, purifying half GST fusion proteins still difficult, virtually insoluble non-denaturing conditions. optimize simple rapid purification condition GST-pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (GST-PKM2) protein, used 1% sarkosyl lysis 1:200 ratio sarkosyl Triton X-100 (S-T) purification. purified GST-PKM2 protein high yield, approximately 5 mg/L culture, 33 times higher prepared using conventional method. Notably, GST-high-temperature requirement A2 (GST-HtrA2) protein, used model protein functional activity, fully maintained proteolytic activity, even purified S-T condition. method may useful apply biologically important proteins become highly insoluble prokaryotic expression system.
