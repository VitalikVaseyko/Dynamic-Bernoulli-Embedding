 measured mass several potential indices functional capacity leg pectoral muscles 21 age chicks three species galliform birds domesticated turkey. study conducted test hypothesis growth rate tissue inversely related capacity mature function across species. measured proportion protein activities catabolic enzymes citrate synthase (CS), pyruvate kinase (PK), beta -hydroxy-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HOAD) estimated exponential growth rate (EGR) growth increments. EGR negatively related proportion protein, PK, HOAD positively related CS activity. multiple regression, EGR uniquely related proportion protein; higher pectoral muscles increased order: wild turkey<pheasant<domestic turkey<chukar. Thus, among wild species, muscles smaller species grew rapidly given proportion protein, domestication selection rapid growth large muscle size turkeys resulted substantially elevated growth rate. proportion protein normalized maximum value species muscle type, relationship EGR normalized protein differ significantly among species muscle type. Thus, accept proportion protein relative mature level index functional capacity--presumably representing assembly contractile apparatus--then growth rate consistently inversely related muscle's capacity mature function, is, force generation.
