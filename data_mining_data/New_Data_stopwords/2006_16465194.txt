 Tumours ferment glucose lactate even presence oxygen (aerobic glycolysis; Warburg effect). pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) allows glucose conversion ribose nucleic acid synthesis glucose degradation lactate. nonoxidative part PPP controlled transketolase enzyme reactions. detected upregulation mutated transketolase transcript (TKTL1) human malignancies, whereas transketolase (TKT) transketolase-like-2 (TKTL2) transcripts upregulated. Strong TKTL1 protein expression correlated invasive colon urothelial tumours poor patients outcome. TKTL1 encodes transketolase unusual enzymatic properties, likely caused internal deletion conserved residues. propose TKTL1 upregulation tumours leads enhanced, oxygen-independent glucose usage lactate-based matrix degradation. inhibition transketolase enzyme reactions suppresses tumour growth metastasis, TKTL1 could relevant target novel anti-transketolase cancer therapies. suggest individualised cancer therapy based determination metabolic changes tumours might enable targeted inhibition invasion metastasis.
