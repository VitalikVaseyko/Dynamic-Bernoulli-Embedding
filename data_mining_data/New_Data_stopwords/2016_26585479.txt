 catabolite control protein (CcpA) kind multi-effect regulatory protein. study, effect inactivation CcpA aerobic conditions growth, metabolic production, stress tolerance heat, oxidative, cold stresses Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus investigated. Results showed inactivation CcpA distinctly hindered growth. Total lactic acid concentration significantly lower aerobiosis strains lower mutant strain L. bulgaricus. Acetic acid production mutant strain higher L. bulgaricus aerobiosis compared anaerobiosis. Enzyme activities, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphate fructose kinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvic dehydrogenase (PDH), significantly lower mutant strain L. bulgaricus. diameters inhibition zone 13.59 +/- 0.02 mm 9.76 +/- 0.02 mm L. bulgaricus anaerobiosis aerobiosis, respectively; 8.12 +/- 0.02 mm 7.38 +/- 0.02 mm mutant anaerobiosis aerobiosis, respectively. strains, cells grown aerobic environment possess stress tolerance. first study CcpA-negative mutant L. bulgaricus constructed effect aerobic growth stress tolerance L. bulgaricus evaluated. Although aerobic cultivation significantly improve growth, improve stress tolerance.
