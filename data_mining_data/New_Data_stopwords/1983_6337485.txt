 insulin-sensitive subcellular system developed rat adipocytes consisting plasma membranes mitochondria. Direct addition insulin, concanavalin anti-insulin receptor antibody system resulted production mediator substance plasma membrane caused dephosphorylation alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase mitochondria concomitant activation enzyme. mediator activated pyruvate dehydrogenase activating pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. similar mechanism insulin causes activation enzyme intact cell. insulin-sensitive mediator material adipocyte plasma membrane acid-stable molecular weight 1,000 1,500. laboratory shown mediator activates pyruvate dehydrogenase present intact adipocytes, hepatoma cells, IM-9 lymphocytes. Insulin altered amount activity mediator consistent effect hormone cell. laboratories shown similar effects skeletal muscle liver. shown mediator mimic insulin action low Km cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) phosphodiesterase (calcium++-magnesium++)-adenosine triphosphatase (Ca++-Mg++)-ATPase adipocyte plasma membranes addition pyruvate dehydrogenase. laboratories shown mediator activate glycogen synthase. body direct indirect evidence exists demonstrates one mediator exists. chemical nature mediator unknown probably represents new family intracellular mediators hormone action. mediators may clinical relevance postreceptor defects obesity type II diabetes (noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus).
