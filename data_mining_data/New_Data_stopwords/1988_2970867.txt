 beneficial effects obtained dehydroisoandrosterone (DHA) feeding treatment murine systemic lupus erythematosus similar obtained caloric restriction dietary manipulation essential fatty acid availability. study, fatty acid composition selected tissues examined NZB/W F1 mice fed diet containing 0.4% DHA. effect DHA diet liver composition activity key hepatic enzymes involved fatty acid synthesis glucose metabolism also investigated. content essential fatty acid, arachidonate, decreased plasma cholesteryl esters liver kidney phospholipids mice fed DHA diet, yet significant decrease arachidonate content observed plasma phospholipid. striking change plasma liver phospholipid increase palmitic acid decrease stearic acid, could result decreased ability fatty acid elongation. liver mass dramatically increased mice fed DHA, primarily parenchymal cell hypertrophy, contained little lipid. Significant changes activities malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, similar changes occur fasting, observed initial adaptation DHA diet. pyruvate kinase activity remained low, suggesting decrease liver glycolysis. results consistent concept diets containing DHA result altered metabolism decreased dependence carbohydrate metabolism increased metabolism lipids.
