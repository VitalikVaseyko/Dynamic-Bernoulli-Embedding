 Protein-protein interactions play important role regulation enzymic activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). generally believed binding PDK inner lipoyl-bearing domain L2 transacetylase component E2 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex largely determines level kinase activity. present study, characterized interaction individual isoenzymes PDK (PDK1-PDK4) monomeric L2 domain human E2, well effect interaction kinase activity. found PDK isoenzymes markedly different respect affinities L2. PDK3 demonstrated tight binding, persisted isolation PDK3-L2 complexes using size-exclusion chromatography. Binding PDK1 PDK2 readily reversible apparent dissociation constant approx. 10 microM isoenzymes. PDK4 greatly reduced capacity L2 binding (relative order PDK3>PDK1=PDK2>PDK4). Monomeric L2 domain alone little effect activities either PDK1 PDK2. contrast, L2 caused 3-fold increase PDK3 activity approx. 37% increase PDK4 activity. results strongly suggest interactions individual isoenzymes PDK L2 domain isoenzyme-specific might among major factors determine level kinase activity particular isoenzyme towards pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
