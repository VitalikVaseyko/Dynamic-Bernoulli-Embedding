 Unique sensitivity tumor cells inhibition glycolysis good target anticancer therapy. Here, demonstrate pharmacologically activated tumor suppressor p53 mediates inhibition glycolytic enzymes cancer cells vitro vivo. showed p53 binds promoters metabolic genes represses expression, including glucose transporters SLC2A12 (GLUT12) SLC2A1 (GLUT1). Furthermore, p53-mediated repression transcription factors c-Myc HIF1alpha, key drivers ATP-generating pathways tumors, contributed ATP production block. Inhibition c-Myc p53 mediated ablation several glycolytic genes normoxia, whereas hypoxia down-regulation HIF1alpha contributed effect. identified Sp1 transcription cofactor cooperating p53 ablation metabolic genes. Using different approaches, demonstrated glycolysis block contributes robust induction apoptosis p53 cancer cells. Taken together, data suggest tumor-specific reinstatement p53 function targets "Achilles heel" cancer cells (i.e. dependence glycolysis), could contribute tumor-selective killing cancer cells pharmacologically activated p53.
