 Zingiber officinale (ZO), commonly known ginger, traditionally used treatment diabetes mellitus. Several studies reported hypoglycaemic properties ginger animal models. present study evaluated antihyperglycaemic effect aqueous extract administered orally (daily) three different doses (100, 300, 500 mg/kg body weight) period 30 streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. dose-dependent antihyperglycaemic effect revealed decrease plasma glucose levels 38 68 % 15th 30th day, respectively, rats given 500 mg/kg. 500 mg/kg ZO significantly (P<0.05) decreased kidney weight (% body weight) ZO-treated diabetic rats v. control rats, although decrease liver weight (% body weight) statistically significant. Kidney glycogen content increased significantly (P<0.05) liver skeletal muscle glycogen content decreased significantly (P<0.05) diabetic controls v. normal controls. ZO (500 mg/kg) also significantly decreased kidney glycogen (P<0.05) increased liver skeletal muscle glycogen STZ-diabetic rats compared diabetic controls. Activities glucokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase diabetic controls decreased 94, 53 61 %, respectively, compared normal controls; ZO significantly increased (P<0.05) enzymes' activities STZ-diabetic rats. Therefore, present study showed ginger potential phytomedicine treatment diabetes effects activities glycolytic enzymes.
