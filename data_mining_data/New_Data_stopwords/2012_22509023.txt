 Despite fact cancer cells display high glycolytic activity, cancer cells selectively express less active M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2). demonstrate PKM2 expression makes critical regulatory contribution serine synthetic pathway. absence serine, allosteric activator PKM2, glycolytic efflux lactate significantly reduced PKM2-expressing cells. inhibition PKM2 results accumulation glycolytic intermediates feed serine synthesis. consequence, PKM2-expressing cells maintain mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 activity proliferate serine-depleted medium, PKM1-expressing cells cannot. Cellular detection serine depletion depends general control nonderepressible 2 kinase-activating transcription factor 4 (GCN2-ATF4) pathway activation results increased expression enzymes required serine synthesis accumulating glycolytic precursors. findings suggest tumor cells use serine-dependent regulation PKM2 GCN2 modulate flux glycolytic intermediates support cell proliferation.
