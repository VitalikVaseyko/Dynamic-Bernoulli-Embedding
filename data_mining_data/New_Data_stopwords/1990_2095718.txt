 present study undertaken examine whether dichloroacetate, inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and, therefore, increases activity pyruvate dehydrogenase, attenuates myocardial acidosis metabolic changes induced coronary occlusion. dogs anesthetized pentobarbital, left anterior descending coronary artery incompletely occluded reduce left anterior descending flow half one third original flow (partial occlusion) produce myocardial (regional) ischemia. Partial occlusion continued 90 min, bolus injection saline dichloroacetate made intravenously 30 min onset occlusion. Partial occlusion decreased myocardial pH significantly. injection dichloroacetate (150 mg/kg) increased myocardial pH lowered partial occlusion. Myocardial metabolites measured dogs. Partial occlusion decreased myocardial levels adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate energy charge potential, increased lactate significantly, without affecting myocardial levels pyruvate nonesterified fatty acids. Dichloroacetate attenuated ischemia-induced changes myocardial levels adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, energy charge potential lactate. results indicate dichloroacetate attenuates myocardial acidosis metabolic changes coronary partial occlusion.
