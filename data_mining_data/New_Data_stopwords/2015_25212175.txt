 unique metabolism breast cancer cells provides interest exploiting phenomenon therapeutically. Metformin, promising breast cancer therapeutic, targets complex electron transport chain leading accumulation reactive oxygen species (ROS) eventually lead cell death. Inhibition complex leads lactate production, metabolic byproduct already highly produced reprogrammed cancer cells associated poor prognosis. metformin remains promising cancer therapeutic, sought complementary agent increase apoptotic promoting effects metformin attenuating lactate production possibly leading greatly improved efficacy. Dichloroacetate (DCA) well-established drug used treatment lactic acidosis functions inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) promoting mitochondrial metabolism. purpose examine synergy mechanisms two drugs kill breast cancer cells. Cell lines subjected indicated treatments analyzed cell death various aspects metabolism. Cell death ROS production analyzed using flow cytometry, Western blot analysis, cell counting methods. Images cells taken phase contrast microscopy confocal microscopy. Metabolism cells analyzed using Seahorse XF24 analyzer, lactate assays, pH analysis. show DCA metformin used combination, synergistic induction apoptosis breast cancer cells occurs. Metformin-induced oxidative damage enhanced DCA PDK1 inhibition also diminishes metformin promoted lactate production. demonstrate DCA metformin combine synergistically induce caspase-dependent apoptosis involving oxidative damage simultaneous attenuation metformin promoted lactate production. Innovative combinations metformin DCA show promise expanding breast cancer therapies.
