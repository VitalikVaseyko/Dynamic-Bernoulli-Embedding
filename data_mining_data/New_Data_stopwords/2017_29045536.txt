 Background: Two recent observations regarding Warburg effect (i) metabolism stem cells constitutive (aerobic) glycolysis normal cellular differentiation involves transition oxidative phosphorylation (ii) degree glucose uptake malignancy imaged 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) associated histologic measures tumor differentiation. Combining observations, hypothesized high levels glucose uptake observed poorly differentiated cancers may reflect persistence glycolytic metabolism stem cells malignant cells fail fully differentiate. Patients methods: Tumor glucose uptake measured FDG-PET 552 patients histologically diverse cancers. used normal mixture modeling explore FDG-PET standardized uptake value (SUV) distributions tested associations glucose uptake histological differentiation, risk lymph node metastasis, survival. Using RNA-seq data, carried pathway transcription factor analyses compare tumors high low levels glucose uptake. Results: found well-differentiated tumors low FDG uptake, moderately poorly differentiated tumors higher uptake. distribution SUV histology bimodal, low peak around SUV 2-5 high peak SUV 8-14. cancers two modes clinically distinct terms risk nodal metastases death. Carbohydrate metabolism pentose-related pathway elevated poorly differentiated/high SUV clusters. Embryonic stem cell-related signatures activated poorly differentiated/high SUV clusters. Conclusions: findings support hypothesis biological basis Warburg effect persistence stem cell metabolism (i.e. aerobic glycolysis) cancers failure transition glycolysis-utilizing undifferentiated cells oxidative phosphorylation-utilizing differentiated cells. found cancers cluster along differentiation pathway two groups, utilizing either glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation. results implications multiple areas clinical oncology.
