 investigated potential role adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) controlling levels enzymes energy metabolism primary cultures rat skeletal muscle cells. Incubating myotubes cholera toxin forskolin (2 persistent activators adenylate cyclase) significantly increased levels two enzymes oxidative metabolism, fumarase malate dehydrogenase. enzymes also increased (1.5- 2.0-fold) phosphodiesterase inhibitors (caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, papaverine, MJ 1988, Ro 20-1724, SQ 20009) cAMP derivatives: 8-bromo-cAMP dibutyryl cAMP. contrast two enzymes glycolytic metabolism, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, consistently affected agents. results presented provide strong evidence increase cAMP lead increase certain enzymes oxidative energy metabolism.
