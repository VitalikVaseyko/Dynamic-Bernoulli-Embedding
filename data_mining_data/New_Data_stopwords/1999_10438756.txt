 Adaptation glucose metabolism Leishmania donovani promastigotes (insect stage) investigated simultaneously measuring metabolic rates, enzyme activities, message levels, cellular parameters various conditions. Chemostats used adapt cells different growth rates growth rate-limiting excess glucose concentrations. L. donovani catabolized glucose CO(2), succinate, acetate, pyruvate ratios depended growth rate glucose availability. Rates glucose consumption linear function growth rate twice high excess glucose-grown cells glucose-limited organisms. major end product CO(2), organic end products also formed ratios varied strongly growth conditions. specific activities 14 metabolic enzymes measured varied factors 3 17. Two groups enzymes adapted specific activities parallel, correlation groups. activities one group correlated specific rates glucose metabolism. Total RNA content per cellular protein varied factor 6 showed linear relationship rate glucose consumption. correlation steady-state message levels activities corresponding enzymes, suggesting regulation posttranscriptional level. comparison adaptation energy metabolism L. donovani species suggests energy metabolism L. donovani inefficient well suited environmental challenges encounters residence sandfly, insect vector.
