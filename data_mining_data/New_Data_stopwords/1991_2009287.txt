 Phenylacetyl-CoA ligase (AMP-forming) Pseudomonas putida newly described enzyme (Martinez-Blanco, H., Reglero, A., Rodriguez-Aparicio, L.B. Luengo, J.M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7084-7090) specifically involved catabolism phenylacetic acid. enzyme catalyzes formation phenylacetyl-CoA presence ATP, CoA, Mg2+ phenylacetic acid. rapid method assaying enzyme partially purified preparations developed coupling reaction adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase kinase lactate dehydrogenase. rate phenylacetyl-CoA formation measured indirectly monitoring fluorometrically NADH oxidation 340 nm (excitation 340 nm analysis emitted light 465 nm). advantage method assay others (colorimetric, HPLC spectrophotometric) discussed.
