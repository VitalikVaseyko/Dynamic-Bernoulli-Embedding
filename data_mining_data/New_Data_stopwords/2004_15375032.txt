 Nutrient sensing hypothalamus tightly related food intake regulation. However, mechanisms nutrient-sensing cells brain translate signal energy need feeding behavior via regulation neuropeptide expression known. address issue, investigated two neuronal cell lines expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP), ex vivo hypothalamic tissues, vivo whole animals. Maintaining cells low cellular ATP concentration generated low glucose, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), ATP synthesis inhibitor, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-d-ribofuranoside increased phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased AgRP expression, whereas maintaining cells high ATP status high glucose pyruvate supplementation 2-DG-treated cells decreased phosphorylation AMPK decreased AgRP expression. Overexpression dominant-inhibitory mutant AMPK significantly decreased low-glucose- 2-DG-induced AgRP expression. Furthermore, ex vivo hypothalamus culture high glucose concentrations decreased expression phosphorylation AMPK expression AgRP neuropeptide Y, whereas pyruvate supplementation suppressed 2-DG-induced AgRP expression. Finally, vivo studies clearly show central administration pyruvate dramatically delayed 2-DG-induced food intake. data indicate modulation ATP levels neuronal cells triggers cascade events via AMPK modulate feeding behavior restore energy status cells.
