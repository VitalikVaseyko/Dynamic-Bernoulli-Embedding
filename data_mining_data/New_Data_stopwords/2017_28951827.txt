 BACKGROUND: recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) identified pancreatic beta-cell culprit pathogenesis disease. Mitochondrial metabolism plays crucial role processes controlling release insulin beta-cell mass. notion implies mechanisms controlling mitochondrial function potential play decisive pathogenetic role T2D. SCOPE REVIEW: article reviews studies demonstrating indeed mitochondrial dysfunction islets T2D, GWAS identified variant gene encoding transcription factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M), predisposing T2D due mitochondrial dysfunction impaired insulin secretion. Mechanistic studies nature pathogenetic link, well mitochondrial transcription factors, described. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Based this, argued transcription translation mitochondria critical processes determining mitochondrial function beta-cells health disease.
