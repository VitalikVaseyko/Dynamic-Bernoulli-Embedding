 1. cell-free system prepared Bacillus brevis cells, harvested late phase growth consisting 11000g supernatant, shown incorporate gramicidin five constituent amino acids added labelled form. results consistent complete synthesis merely completion pre-existing intermediate peptides. 2. incorporation (14)C-labelled amino acids 11000g supernatant gramicidin requires energy source. Omission phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase incubation mixture prevents incorporation gramicidin S. cell-free system incorporates [(14)C]-leucine, -proline -phenylalanine period 4hr. [(14)C]leucine, incorporation gramicidin takes place range pH6-9 maximum incorporation pH7.0. High concentrations chloramphenicol puromycin decreased incorporation gramicidin 20%. 3. 50000g supernatant exhibited decrease ability incorporating [(14)C]valine gramicidin compared 11000g supernatant. 40% incorporating ability remained 105000g supernatant 3hr. centrifugation. recombining 105000g sediment 105000g supernatant, increase incorporation obtained supernatant alone obtained. findings tend support view gramicidin synthesized different manner proteins.
