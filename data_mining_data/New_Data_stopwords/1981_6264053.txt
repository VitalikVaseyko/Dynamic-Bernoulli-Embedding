 study examined effects acute dietary restriction aerobic anaerobic metabolic capacity skeletal cardiac muscles. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats fed 28% casein diet body weight 100 g. control group killed 100 g experimental groups starved 70 g body weight either 4-day total restriction (TR) 9-day partial restriction (PR). heart, soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), biceps brachii, psoas red white portions gastrocnemius (GR GW) assayed oxygen uptake succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Cytochrome c also measured gastrocnemius psoas. decrease muscle weight similar 30% decrease body weight exception soleus decreased 10% due either TR PR. PK, estimate anaerobic capacity, appeared increase per unit weight tissues TR PR; however, total muscle PK remained unchanged. Total cytochrome c SDH activity, estimate aerobic capacity, decreased muscles either treatment. largest decreases SDH 38% soleus 51% heart TR 50% GR 48% GW PR. Oxygen uptake increased soleus (20%) heart (70%) decreased skeletal muscles greatest effect PR (50%). study shown decrease aerobic capacity acute starvation total muscle anaerobic metabolic capacity remains near normal.
