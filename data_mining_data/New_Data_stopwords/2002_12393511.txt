 established molecular basis pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency white male patient severe nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. paternal allele exhibited common PKLR cDNA sequence (c.) 1529G>A mutation, known associated PK deficiency. maternal allele, 3 cis mutations identified erythroid-specific promoter region gene: one deletion thymine -248 2 single nucleotide substitutions, nucleotide (nt) -324T>A nt -83G>C. Analysis patient's RNA demonstrated presence 1529A allele, indicating severely reduced transcription allele linked mutated promoter region. Transfection promoter constructs erythroleukemic K562 cells showed upstream -324T>A -248delT mutations nonfunctional polymorphisms. contrast, -83G>C mutation strongly reduced promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis promoter region revealed presence putative regulatory element (PKR-RE1) whose core binding motif, CTCTG, located nt -87 nt -83. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using K562 nuclear extracts indicated binding as-yet-unidentified trans-acting factor. novel element mediates effects factors necessary regulation pyruvate kinase gene expression red cell differentiation maturation.
