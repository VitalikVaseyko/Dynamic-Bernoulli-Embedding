 Enzyme activities operative glucose degradation citrate cleavage pathway studied adipose tissue twenty-four patients adult-onset diabetes normal body weight, aged 59+/-9 years, twenty-four matched controls. normal tissue, type II (heat-inactivated) hexokinase moderately predominated type (heat-resistant). 6-Phosphofructokinase extremely low activity, far lowest among ten glycolytic enzyme activities investigated, therefore might greatly limit glycolytic rate. level glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) elevated occurring tissues. This, especially considered together low 6-phosphofructokinase activity, would suggest major role pentose cycle glucose degradation. citrate cleavage pathway enzymes, ATP citrate-lyase, although lower activity malate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP), readily measurable, contrasts previous data others. finding consistent occurrence lipogenetic capacity human adipose tissue. diabetic tissue, decreased activity, protein wet-weight basis, enzymes concerned glucose entry metabolic pathways, namely hexokinase (both type and, especially, type II) pentose cycle dehydrogenases, well pyruvate kinase. could connected defective glucose utilization adipose tissue diabetes. Beside above-mentioned dehydrogenases, malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP) also diminished. reduction NADPH-forming enzymes, supply reducing equivalents fatty acid synthesis, would suggest depressed lipogenesis.
