 variance current view liver kidney gluconeogenic organs, tissues express glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc6Pase), recently demonstrated Glc6Pase gene expressed small intestine rats humans induced insulinopenic states fasting diabetes. used combination arteriovenous balance isotopic techniques, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot analysis, enzymatic activity assays. report rat small intestine release neosynthesized glucose mesenteric blood insulinopenia, contributing 20-25% total endogenous glucose production. Like liver glucose production, small intestine glucose production acutely suppressed insulin infusion. small intestine, glutamine and, much lesser extent, glycerol precursors glucose, whereas alanine lactate main precursors liver. Accounting metabolic fluxes: 1) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene (required utilization glutamine) strongly induced mRNA enzyme levels insulinopenia; 2) glycerokinase gene expressed, induced; 3) pyruvate carboxylase gene (required utilization alanine lactate) repressed 80% enzyme level insulinopenia. studies identify small intestine new insulin-sensitive tissue third gluconeogenic organ, possibly involved pathophysiology diabetes.
