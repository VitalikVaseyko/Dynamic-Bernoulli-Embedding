 Secondary mutation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resulting drug resistance one critical issues lung cancer therapy. Several drugs developed overcome EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. Here, report pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) stabilized mutant EGFR protein direct interaction sustained cell survival signaling lung cancer cells. PKM2 silencing resulted markedly reduced mutant EGFR expression TKI-sensitive -resistant human lung cancer cells, inhibition tumor growth xenografts, concomitant downregulation EGFR-related signaling. Mechanistically, PKM2 directly interacted mutant EGFR heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), thus stabilized EGFR maintaining binding HSP90 co-chaperones. Stabilization EGFR relied dimeric PKM2, protein half-life mutant EGFR decreased PKM2 forced tetramer form. Clinical levels PKM2 positively correlated mutant EGFR expression patient outcome. results reveal previously undescribed non-glycolysis function PKM2 cytoplasm, contribute EGFR-dependent tumorigenesis provide novel strategy overcome drug resistance EGFR TKIs.
