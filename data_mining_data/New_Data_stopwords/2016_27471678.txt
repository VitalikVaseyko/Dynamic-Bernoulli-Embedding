 several decades, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents considered basis anticancer treatment patients metastatic tumors. decrease tumor burden, assessed volumetric computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging, according response evaluation criteria solid tumors (RECIST), considered radiological response cytotoxic chemotherapies. addition RECIST-based dimensional measurements, metabolic response cytotoxic drugs assessed positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluoro-thymidine (FLT) radioactive tracer drug-disrupted DNA synthesis. decreased (18)FLT-PET uptake often seen concurrently increased apparent diffusion coefficients diffusion-weighted imaging due chemotherapy-induced changes tumor cellularity. Recently, discovery molecular origins tumorogenesis led introduction novel signal transduction inhibitors (STIs). STIs targeted cytostatic agents; effect based specific biological inhibition immediate cell death. such, tumor size anymore sensitive end point treatment response STIs; novel physiological imaging end points desirable. receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors well modulators downstream signaling pathways, almost immediate inhibition glycolytic activity (the Warburg effect) phospholipid turnover (the Kennedy pathway) seen metabolic imaging first 24 h treatment. quantitative imaging end points magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolic PET (including 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose, FDG, total choline) provide early treatment response targeted STIs, reduction tumor burden seen.
