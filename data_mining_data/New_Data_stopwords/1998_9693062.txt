 procedure developed overexpression Trypanosoma brucei pyruvate kinase Escherichia coli. enzyme purified near-homogeneity bacterial lysate first removing nucleic acids contaminating proteins protamine sulfate precipitation subsequent passage phosphocellulose column. purified protein essentially indistinguishable physicochemical kinetic properties enzyme purified trypanosomes. Furthermore, experiments undertaken locate binding site allosteric effector fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Regulation pyruvate kinase effector unique trypanosomes related protozoan organisms. Therefore, three-dimensional structure model enzyme made, putative effector-binding site could identified interdomain cleft. Four residues cleft mutated, mutant proteins produced purified, using methodology wild-type pyruvate kinase. mutants showed minor changes activation effector. However, substitution Arg22 Gly resulted 9.2-fold higher S(0.5) phosphoenolpyruvate significantly smaller kcat wild-type enzyme. Furthermore, apparent affinity mutant allosteric effectors fructose 1,6-bisphosphate fructose 2,6-bisphosphate 8.2- 5.2-fold lower wild-type counterpart. Effector binding also affected, although lesser extent, mutant Phe463Val. data indicate particularly residue Arg22, also Phe463, somehow involved binding allosteric effectors.
