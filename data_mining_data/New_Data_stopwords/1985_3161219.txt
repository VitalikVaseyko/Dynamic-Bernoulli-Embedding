 vitro effect acrylamide analogues rat brain glycolytic enzymes examined elucidate biochemical lesions responsible pathogenesis acrylamide-induced neuropathy. test compounds inhibited glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, irrespective neurotoxicity, inhibitory potency linear function rate constant reduced glutathione. Phosphofructokinase also inhibited test compounds, independently neurotoxicity. rate-limiting enzymes glycolysis, hexokinase pyruvate kinase, inhibited acrylamide.
