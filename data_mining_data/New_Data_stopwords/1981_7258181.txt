 familial erythrocytosis described. propositus 52-year-old man found, routine testing, erythrocytosis Hb level 19.8 g/dl. Physical examination laboratory findings revealed associated hemolysis. P50 stripped hemolysis normal. 2,3-DPG level reduced 15% normal ATP increased twofold. Red cell diphosphoglycerate mutase activity normal levels red cell glycolytic hexose monophosphate shunt enzymes exception pyruvate kinase (PK). level latter elevated 24.5 U/g (normal: 6.2 +/- 1.1). electrophoretic pattern hemolysate PK abnormal, showing three additional bands, one migrated M2 isozyme. findings similar propositus's daughter daughter one two brothers propositus. second brother son first brother exhibited erythrocytosis red cell 2,3-DPG levels normal. addition, level RBC PK reduced 50% 60% normal abnormal electrophoretic bands absent. erythrocytosis appears inherited autosomal-dominant trait. relationship PK abnormalities appears complex.
