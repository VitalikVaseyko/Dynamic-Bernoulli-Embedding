 Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha plays central role oxygen homeostasis energy supply glycolysis many cell types. previously reported HIF-1alpha gene deficiency caused abnormal B cell development autoimmunity. study show HIF-1alpha-enabled glycolysis B cell development required developmental stage-specific manner. Supporting conclusion observations glycolytic pathway HIF-1alpha-deficient B220(+) bone marrow cells much less functionally effective wild-type control cells. expression genes encoding glucose transporters key glycolytic enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bishosphatase 3, greatly reduced HIF-1alpha-deficient cells. compensatory adaptation defect glycolysis reflected higher levels expression respiratory chain-related genes TCA cycle-related genes HIF-1alpha-deficient cells wild-type cells. agreement findings, HIF-1alpha-deficient cells used pyruvate efficiently wild-type cells. key role HIF-1alpha-enabled glycolysis bone marrow B cells also demonstrated glucose deprivation vitro bone marrow cell culture using glycolysis inhibitor bone marrow cell culture. Taken together, findings indicate glucose dependency differs different B cell developmental stages HIF-1alpha plays important role B cell development.
