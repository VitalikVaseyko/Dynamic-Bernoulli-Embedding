 Fifteen red cell enzyme activities growth-retarded patients without growth hormone (GH) deficiency investigated GH administration. 15 enzymes Hexokinase, phosphoglucomutase, glucose phosphate, isomerase, phosphofructokinase, fructose diphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphae dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, glycose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase, glutathione reducase. Sixty-six subjects studied: 30 normal control subjects (group N) 36 patients (aged 5-23 years) short stature. Complete endocrine evaluation showed 21 (group I) GH deficiency (10 patients isolated GH deficiency) 15 (group II) normal hypothalamic pituitary function except two patients moderate hypothyroidism. receiving thyroid hormone treatment long time studies. 36 patients treated 2 mg human growth hormone intramuscularly 7 days. GH treatment significant difference observed hematologic data group (GH deficiency) group II (no GH deficiency). GH therapy significant increase reticulocyte count groups patients short stature. mean pretreatment value group 1.294% +/- 0.084 (SEM); mean post-treatment value 2.081% +/- 0.287 (SEM)< P less 0.005. mean pretreatment value group II 1.0% 0.184 (SEM); mean post-treatment value 1.407% +/- 0.193 (SEM), P less 0.01. group II (no GH deficiency) mean pretreatment erythrocyte enzyme activities significantly different activities observed normal control subjects (group N). However, patients lacked GH, pretreatment activities five red cell enzymes (glucose phosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase) significantly decreased GH administration compared values normal control subjects...
