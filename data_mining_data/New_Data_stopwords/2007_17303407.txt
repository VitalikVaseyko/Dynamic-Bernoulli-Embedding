 known quite time cancer cells undergo far-reaching modifications metabolism, yet full understanding changes come remains elusive. Even conditions plentiful oxygen, cancer cells choose switch glucose metabolism respiration lactic acid formation. mystery behind molecular mechanisms phenomenon, known Warburg effect, unravelled. reduced respiration rate increased glucose uptake associated lactic acid production, acidosis micro-environment, primarily due activation alpha/beta hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. distinctive metabolic nature cancer cells already exploited diagnostic tool yet harnessed therapeutic intervention.
