 absence unambiguous test identifying Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) heterozygotes, methods needed combination results individually equivocal tests effectively rationally possible. Tw used logistic discrimination assess effectiveness measurements serum creatine kinase, hemopexin, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase alone various combinations identifying DMD carriers. analyzed 127 serum samples 63 normal female controls (20-40 years old) 67 38 obligate DMD carriers. best two tests use combination creatine kinase hemopexin, two, lactate dehydrogenase, best three. 95% level (with 5% controls misclassified), 54% carriers identified CK alone, whereas 88% identified means four tests. Although small proportion known carriers still cannot identified, application four tests group 45 possible carrier mothers isolated cases DMD resolves population fairly discrete "normal" "abnormal" subgroups. Thus, bias selection eliminated, application logistic discrimination may permit direct estimate proportion mothers affected boys homozygous normal.
