 Excessive fructose ingestion drastically enhances hepatic lipid accumulation. prominent form inositol-myo-inositol (MI)-remarkably reduces high sucrose-induced hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. MI major strong lipotrope, hypothesized study MI improves fatty liver induced excessive ingestion fructose sucrose. Rats fed high-glucose diet (HGD), high-fructose diet (HFD), HFD supplemented 0.2% MI 12 days. Hepatic levels TG mRNAs fructolysis (ketohexokinase aldolase B), lipogenesis (pyruvate kinase, liver, RBC; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha; fatty acid synthase; stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1), key transcription factor lipogenesis-carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-were significantly increased HFD group compared HGD group, increase markedly decreased MI supplementation. Similarly, HFD-induced pyruvate kinase, liver, RBC fatty acid synthase protein levels liver reduced MI treatment. hand, hepatic levels mRNAs beta-oxidation (acyl-CoA synthetase carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) differ among 3 groups. Taken together, study showed MI supplementation decreases expression fructolytic/lipogenic genes lipogenic proteins well TG accumulation high fructose-induced fatty liver rats.
