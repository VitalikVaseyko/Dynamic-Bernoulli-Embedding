 Chemoprevention pivotal effective strategy skin cancer treatment. Using human skin normal tumor samples, demonstrated expression activity levels pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) higher skin tumor tissues normal tissues, suggesting PKM2, one important metabolic enzyme, might serve target skin cancer prevention and/or therapy. Shikonin, small-molecule active chemical, studied anti-cancer drug candidate human cancer models. However, mechanism action chemopreventive potential shikonin unclear. Herein, used skin epidermal JB6 P+ cells demonstrated shikonin suppressed tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induced neoplastic cell transformation PKM2 activation early stage carcinogenesis. Mitochondrial functions inhibited TPA treatment, indicated reduced mitochondrial membrane potential mitochondrial respiration, restored shikonin. also examined levels lactate glycolysis marker, shikonin suppressed increase caused tumor promoter treatment. Modulation cell metabolism shikonin associated G2-M phase accumulation, Fra-1 (a major subunit activator protein 1 skin tumorigenesis) downregulation. addition, demonstrated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), energy sensor, inactivated TPA, shikonin could reverse AMPK activity. results suggest shikonin bears chemopreventive potential human skin cancers PKM2 upregulated, might mediated inhibiting oncogenic activation, PKM2 activation, mitochondrial dysfunction.
