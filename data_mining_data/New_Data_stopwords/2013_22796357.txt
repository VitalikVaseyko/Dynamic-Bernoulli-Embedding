 Various biochemical genomic mechanisms considered hallmark metabolic remodeling stressed heart, including hypertrophied failing heart. study, used quantitative proteomic 2-D Fluorescence Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) conjunction mass spectrometry demonstrate differential protein expression hearts transgenic rabbit models Long QT Syndrome 1 (LQT1) Long QT Syndrome 2 (LQT2) compared littermate controls (LMC). results proteomic analysis revealed upregulation key metabolic enzymes involved pathways associated ATP generation, including creatine kinase LQT1 LQT2 rabbit hearts. Additionally, expression lamin-A protein increased LQT1 LQT2 rabbit hearts expression mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase desmoplakin LQT1 LQT 2 rabbit hearts, respectively. Results proteomic analysis also demonstrated regulation expression protein disulfide-isomerase A3 precuorsor dynamin-like 120 kDa protein (mitochondrial) LQT1, alpha-actinin 2 LQT2 rabbit hearts. regulation expression enzymes associated ATP generation substantiated results selective enzyme assays LQT1 LQT2 hearts, compared LMC, revealed increases activities glycogen phosphorylase (+50%, +65%, respectively), lactate dehydrogenase (+25%, +25%) pyruvate dehydrogenase (+31%, +22%), succinate dehydrogenase (+32%, +60%). activity cytochrome c-oxidase, marker mitochondrial function also found significantly elevated (+80%) LQT1 rabbit hearts compared LMC. Western blot analysis LQT1 LQT2 hearts compared LMC revealed increase expression very-long chain-specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (+35%, +33%), rate-limiting enzymes beta-oxidation fatty acids. Collectively, results demonstrate similar increases expression activities key ATP-generating enzymes LQT1 LQT2 rabbit hearts, suggesting increased demand, turn, increased energy supply across entire metabolic pathway virtue upregulation enzymes involved energy generation.
