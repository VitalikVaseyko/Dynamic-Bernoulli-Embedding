 low 2,3-disphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) level fetal rabbit red cells attributed previously high pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. present report shows high PK activity associated distinct fetal isozyme. Fetal adult rabbit red cell PK characterized methods recommended International Committee Standardization Haematology. Fetal red cell PK differed adult enzyme greater thermostability, lower affinities phosphoenolpyruvate ADP, higher nucleotide specificity lower ATP inhibition. Marked electrophoretic differences detected. results indicate developmental change red cell PK isozyme expression rabbit. know, however, change arises gene level cell-age dependent postsynthetic modifications enzyme. view role PK control 2,3-DPG level thereby oxygen affinity red blood cells, assume physiological significance PK isozyme change akin switch fetal adult hemoglobin species.
