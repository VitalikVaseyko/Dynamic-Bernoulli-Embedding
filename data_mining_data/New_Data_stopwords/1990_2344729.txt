 1. Pigeon erythrocyte found depend glycolytic pentose phosphate pathway energy production form adenosine triphosphate reducing potential, since detectable activity citric acid cycle (TCA) cycle enzymes measured. 2. absence detectable amounts 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2-3-DPG) indicated direct relationship active glycolytic system function cells. 3. comparison mass action ratios equilibrium constants glycolytic reactions showed hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase reactions displaced equilibrium, implying key regulatory enzymes glycolysis pigeon erythrocytes. 4. changes concentrations glycolytic metabolites hypoxic conditions stimulate flux glycolytic pathway found consistent hypothesis. 5. Flux measurements pentose phosphate pathway showed metabolizes 3.4% total glucose consumed resting erythrocyte. 6. Hypoxic conditions resulted stimulation pentose phosphate pathway much four-fold, whilst glycolytic pathway stimulated twice.
