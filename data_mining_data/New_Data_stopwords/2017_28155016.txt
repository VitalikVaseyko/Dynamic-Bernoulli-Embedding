 Colorectal cancer (CRC) multistep process involves adenoma-carcinoma sequence. CRC prevented routine screening, detect precancerous lesions. aim study clarify whether faecal occult blood test (i-FOBT), tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (t-M2-PK), endocannabinoid system molecules (cannabinoid receptors type 1-CB1, type 2-CB2, fatty acid amide hydrolase-FAAH) might represent better diagnostic tools, alone combination, early diagnosis CRC. immunochemical FOB test (i-FOBT) quantitative ELISA stool test t-M2-PK performed 127 consecutive patients 12 month period. Endocannabinoid system molecules t-M2-PK expression detected immunostaining healthy tissues normal mucosa surrounding adenomatous cancerous colon lesions. i-FOBT t-M2-PK combination leads better diagnostic accuracy pre-neoplastic neoplastic colon lesions. T-M2-PK quantification stool samples biopsy samples (immunostaining) correlates tumourigenesis stages. CB1 CB2 well expressed healthy tissues, expression decreases presence advanced stages carcinogenesis disappears CRC. FAAH signal well expressed normal mucosa low-risk adenoma, increased high-risk adenoma carcinoma adjacent tissues. study shows high levels t-M2-PK addition FOBT enhance power CRC screening test. Endocannabinoid system molecule expression correlates colon carcinogenesis stages. Developing future faecal tests quantification must undertaken obtain accurate early non-invasive diagnosis CRC.
