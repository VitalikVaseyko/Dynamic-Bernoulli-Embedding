 Fasting forces adaptive changes whole body skeletal muscle metabolism increase fat oxidation decrease oxidation carbohydrate. tested hypothesis 40 h fasting would decrease pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity increase PDH kinase (PDK) isoform mRNA expression human skeletal muscle. putative transcriptional activators PDK isozymes, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) protein, forkhead homolog rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR) mRNA also measured. Eleven healthy adults fasted standard meal (25% fat, 60% carbohydrate, 15% protein) blood skeletal muscle samples taken 3, 15, 40 h postprandial. Fasting increased plasma free fatty acid, glycerol, beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations decreased glucose insulin concentrations. PDH activity decreased 0.88 +/- 0.11 mmol acetyl-CoA. min(-1). kg wet muscle wt(-1) 3 h 0.62 +/- 0.10 (P = significant) 0.39 +/- 0.06 (P < 0.05) mmol. min(-1). kg wet mass(-1) 15 40 h fasting. Although four PDK isoforms expressed human skeletal muscle, PDK-2 -4 mRNA abundant. PDK-1 -3 mRNA abundance approximately 1 15% PDK-2 -4 levels, respectively. 40-h fast effect PDK-1, -2, -3 mRNA expression. PDK-4 mRNA significantly increased approximately 3-fold 15 h approximately 14-fold 40 h fasting. Skeletal muscle PPAR-alpha protein FKHR mRNA abundance unaffected fast. results suggest decreased PDH activation 40 h fasting may function large increase PDK-4 mRNA expression possible subsequent increase PDK protein activity. changes PDK-4 expression PDH activity coincide increases transcriptional activators PPAR-alpha FKHR.
