 SCOPE: Enhancing formation function brown adipose tissue (BAT) increases thermogenesis hence reduces obesity. Thus, investigate effects resveratrol (Resv) brown adipocyte formation function mouse interscapular BAT (iBAT). METHODS RESULTS: CD1 mice stromal vascular cells (SVCs) isolated iBAT treated Resv. Expression brown adipogenic thermogenic markers, involvement AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)alpha1 assessed. vivo, Resv-enhanced expression brown adipogenic markers, PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) thermogenic genes, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) cytochrome C iBAT, along smaller lipid droplets, elevated AMPKalpha activity increased oxygen consumption. Meanwhile, Resv promoted expression PRDM16, UCP1, PGC1alpha, cytochrome C pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) differentiated iBAT SVCs, suggesting Resv enhanced brown adipocyte formation function vitro. addition, Resv stimulated AMPKalpha oxygen consumption differentiated iBAT SVCs. However, promotional effects Resv diminished AMPK inhibition AMPKalpha1 knockout, implying involvement AMPKalpha1 process. CONCLUSION: Resv enhanced brown adipocyte formation thermogenic function mouse iBAT promoting expression brown adipogenic markers via activating AMPKalpha1, contributed anti-obesity effects Resv.
