 describe cellular molecular biologic studies erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency Amish deme Pennsylvania. Nucleotide sequencing patient's PK gene showed point mutation, CGC CAC, corresponding no. 1436 translational initiation site R-type PK (R-PK) mRNA, caused single amino acid substitution Arg 479th amino acid residue R-PK. substituted Arg residue located C domain PK subunit, essential intersubunit contact allosteric regulation. enzyme shows catalytic activity dimer tetramer, rational structural alteration would result severe PK deficiency. elucidate effect PK deficiency red blood cell (RBC) membrane, performed cellular studies patients' RBCs. Ouabain-insensitive K+ efflux increased 142% 145% normal controls inhibited furosemide, previously observed HbSC disease RBCs.
