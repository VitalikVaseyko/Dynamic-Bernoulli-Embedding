 Scaffold/matrix-attached regions (S/MARs) cis-acting elements function outside transcribed regions introns. Although usually augment transcriptional rates, action highly context-dependent. cloned 800 bp S/MAR element upstream border human interferon-beta domain various positions within transcribed region 4.3 kb. use retroviral gene transfer, vector could integrated target cells single copy enabling rigorous definition distance S/MAR transcriptional start site. distance 4 kb, S/MAR supported transcriptional initiation, whereas distances 2.5 kb, transcription essentially shut off. Controls proved functionally constructs transient expression phase ruled influence S/MAR position transcript stability. Moreover, pausing premature termination observed within elements. suggest protein binding partners S/MARs change according topological status, explaining divergent S/MAR effects.
