 Classical phenylketonuria (PKU) caused deficiency phenylalanine hydroxylase, resulting accumulation upstream metabolite phenylalanine brain tissue cerebrospinal fluid PKU patients. PKU neuropathologically characterized reduced dendritic arborization, loss synapses, neurodegeneration. investigated whether increased concentrations phenylalanine cause reduced synaptic density alter dendritic branching. treated primary cortical neurons differentiated 21 vitro 5 mM phenylalanine presence essential amino acids. Immunocytochemical analysis 12 21 vitro primary neurons revealed changes dendritic morphology neuronal viability significant difference synaptic density, suggesting elevated concentrations extracellular phenylalanine cause impairment synaptogenesis. Although impairment cerebral energy metabolism identified important pathophysiological principal many diseases, respiratory chain function extensively studied PKU before. investigated whether phenylalanine inhibits respiratory chain complexes I-V. vitro analysis revealed inhibitory effect phenylalanine complexes I-V, inhibition pyruvate kinase, key enzyme glycolysis, catalyzing formation pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase part enzyme assay investigate enzyme activity mitochondrial complex V remains elucidated whether finding relevant vivo. conclusion, elevated concentrations phenylalanine might involved mechanisms underlying impaired synaptogenesis PKU, supporting common therapeutic strategy reduce phenylalanine concentrations brain prevent neurodegeneration.
