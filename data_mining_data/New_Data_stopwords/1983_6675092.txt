 vitro incorporation 14C-leucine nonsynaptic synaptic rat brain mitochondria purified means discontinuous Ficoll gradients characterised. incorporation linear first 45 min populations. Synaptic mitochondria showed higher rate incorporation nonsynaptic mitochondria high concentrations leucine. incorporation effective presence Mg2+ inhibited dinitrophenol. incorporation sensitive chloramphenicol insensitive cycloheximide. Bacterial contamination case lower 1,000 colonies per ml incubation period. incorporation carried presence either external ATP-generating system consisting ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase mitochondria respiring oxidisable substrates plus ADP (state III). rates obtained incorporation state III higher substrates assayed (succinate, pyruvate glutamate) presence exogenous ATP. highest rate obtained found glutamate respiratory substrate. significant metabolic oxidation leucine occurs either synaptic nonsynaptic mitochondria presence exogenous ATP. Glutamate increase leucine uptake mitochondrial populations.
