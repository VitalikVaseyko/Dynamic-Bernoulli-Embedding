 Myocardial substrate metabolism enzyme release following hypothermic potassium cardioplegia without addition mannitol cardioplegic solution studied two series patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement. Measurements made PO2. O2-saturation content, PCO2, pH, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, potassium, myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), isoenzyme MB aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) simultaneously arterial coronary sinus blood cardioplegia first 60 min release aortic cross-clamping. addition, myoglobin enzymes followed peripheral venous blood 72 hours cardioplegia. Analysis results revealed striking difference groups. Nevertheless, addition mannitol, slightly lower release lactate myoglobin probably indicating rapid metabolic recovery myocardium.
