 Streptococcus iniae causes invasive disease death fish, lesser extent, sporadic cases soft-tissue infections humans. two-component system termed sivS/R, regulates capsule expression, previously identified characterized. study, shown sivS/R deletion-insertion mutant, termed 9117Deltasiv, causes transient bacteremia reduced virulence compared parent strain tested murine model bacteremic infection. Furthermore, real-time PCR studies indicated SivS/R regulates expression levels streptolysin structural gene, sagA, well CAMP factor gene, cfi. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis S. iniae spheroplasts revealed downregulation three surface proteins mutant strain compared parent strain. proteins identified MS putative lipoprotein, hyaluronate-associated protein pyruvate kinase. study demonstrates SivS/R regulates virulence vivo, controls expression number genes S. iniae.
