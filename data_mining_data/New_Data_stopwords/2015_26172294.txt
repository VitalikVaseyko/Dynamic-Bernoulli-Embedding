 Aerobic glycolysis (production lactate glucose presence oxygen) hallmark cancer. Fenofibrate lipid-lowering drug agonist peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). found FF inhibited glycolysis PPARalpha-dependent manner glioblastoma cells. Fenofibrate inhibited transcriptional activity NF-kappaB/RelA also disrupted association hypoxia inducible factor1 alpha (HIF1alpha), required binding NF-kappaB/RelA PKM promoter PKM2 expression. High ratios PKM2/PKM1 promote glycolysis inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, thus favoring aerobic glycolysis. Fenofibrate decreased PKM2/PKM1 ratio caused mitochondrial damage. Given fenofibrate widely used non-toxic drug, suggest use patients glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
