 electrophoretic study made isozymes pyruvate kinase (PK) various adult foetal tissues, normal pathological (hypothyroid dysmature result retardation intra-uterine growth) rats. simultaneous kinetic study PK without fructose diphosphate (FDP) showed retardation maturation tissues revealed presence M2 isozyme (PK III) longer normal foetal age. increase negative charges, observed relation age, may result structural changes enzyme molecule yet resolved. variations relative electrophoretic mobility, reactivation isozyme FDP suggest repression synthesis certain isozymes normal adult organs.
