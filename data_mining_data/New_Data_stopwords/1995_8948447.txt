 studied relationship effect epidermal growth factor (EGF) glycogen metabolism effect glycolysis, rat hepatocyte suspensions. Although 10 nM glucagon 10 microM adrenaline increased glycogen degradation 120%, 10 nM EGF increased glycogenolysis less 20% hepatocytes incubated glucose-free medium. glucagon adrenaline increased phosphorylase activity 130%; EGF increased activity 30%. basal conditions, 65% glucosyl residues released free glucose 30% ended C3 molecules (lactate pyruvate). glucagon adrenaline decreased proportion glucosyl units rendered glycolysis end-products (to 2% glucagon 6% adrenaline) increased proportion ended free glucose (to 94% 88% glucosyl residues glucagon adrenaline respectively). EGF increased production free glucose lactate+pyruvate, proportion glucosyl residues ended free glucose glycolysis end-products unchanged. glycogen-depleted hepatocytes incubated presence 25 mM glucose, EGF affected neither glycogen deposition glycolysis. EGF increased cytosolic free Ca2+, neomycin decreased Ca2+ signal glycogenolytic effect. conclusion, results indicate effect EGF glycolysis secondary Ca(2+)-mediated stimulation glycogenolysis rat hepatocyte suspensions.
