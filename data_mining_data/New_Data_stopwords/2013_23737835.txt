 Oleanolic acid (OA), contained 1620 plants aglycone precursor naturally occurred synthesized triterpenoid saponins, used China liver disorders humans. However, underlying liver-protecting mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, found treatment rats OA (25 mg/kg/day, gavage, daily) 10 weeks diminished liquid fructose-induced excess hepatic triglyceride accumulation without effect total energy intake. Attenuation increased vacuolization Oil Red staining area evident histological examination liver OA-treated rats. Hepatic gene expression profile demonstrated OA suppressed fructose-stimulated overexpression sterol regulatory element-binding protein-(SREBP-) 1/1c mRNA nuclear protein. accord, overexpression SREBP-1c-responsive genes responsible fatty acid synthesis also downregulated. contrast, overexpressed nuclear protein carbohydrate response element-binding protein target genes liver pyruvate kinase microsomal triglyceride transfer protein altered. Additionally, OA affect expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma- -alpha target genes. concluded modulation hepatic SREBP-1c-mediated expression genes responsible de novo fatty acid synthesis plays pivotal role OA-elicited diminishment fructose-induced fatty liver rats.
