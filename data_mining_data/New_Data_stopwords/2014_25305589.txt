 Metabolic reprogramming thought play key role sustaining survival proliferation cancer cells. changes facilitate example uptake release nutrients required nucleotide, protein lipid synthesis necessary macromolecule assembly tumor growth. applied 2D-DIGE (two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis) quantitative proteomic analysis characterize proteomes mouse astrocytes underwent vitro cancerous transformation, normal counterparts. Metabolic reprogramming effects enzymatic structural protein expression well associated metabolites abundance quantified. Using enzymatic activity measurements zymography, documented confirmed several changes abundance activity various isoenzymes likely participate metabolic reprogramming. found transformation, cells increase expression glycolytic enzymes, thus augmenting ability use aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). increased capacity dispose reducing equivalents lactate production also documented. Major effects carbohydrates, amino acids nucleotides metabolic enzymes also observed. Conversely, transformed cells reduced enzymatic capacity reactions tricarboxylic acid oxidation, neurotransmitter (glutamate) metabolism, oxidative stress defense expression astroglial markers. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: use global approach based 2D DIGE analysis allows obtaining comprehensive view metabolic reprogramming undergone astrocytes upon cancerous transformation. Indeed, except enzymes pyruvate carboxylase glutaminase detected initial analysis, pertinent information abundance enzymes belonging pathways relevant metabolic reprogramming directly obtained. vitro model, transformation causes major losses astrocyte-specific proteins functions acquisition metabolic adaptations favor intermediate metabolites production increased macromolecule biosynthesis. Thus approach appears readily applicable investigation changes protein abundance determine various transformed cell phenotypes. could similarly applied evaluation effects treatments aimed correcting consequences cell transformation.
