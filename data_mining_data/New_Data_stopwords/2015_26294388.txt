 aim study investigate mechanisms fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) affects hepatic integration carbohydrate fat metabolism Siberian hamsters, natural model adiposity. Twelve aged matched adult male Siberian hamsters maintained long-day fat state since birth randomly assigned one two treatment groups continuously infused either vehicle (saline; n=6) recombinant human FGF21 protein (1 mg/kg per day; n=6) 14 days. FGF21 administration caused 40% suppression (P<0.05) hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), rate-limiting step glucose oxidation, 34% decrease (P<0.05) hepatic acetylcarnitine accumulation, index reduced PDC flux, 35% increase (P<0.05) long-chain acylcarnitine content (an index flux beta-oxidation) 47% reduction (P<0.05) hepatic lipid content. effects underpinned increased protein abundance PD kinase-4 (PDK4, negative regulator PDC), phosphorylated (inhibited) form acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC, negative regulator delivery fatty acids mitochondria) transcriptional co-regulators energy metabolism peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma co-activator alpha (PGC1alpha) sirtuin-1. findings provide novel mechanistic basis support notion FGF21 exerts profound metabolic benefits liver modulating nutrient flux carbohydrate (mediated PDK4-mediated suppression PDC activity) fat (mediated deactivation ACC) metabolism, therefore may attractive target protection increased hepatic lipid content insulin resistance frequently accompany obesity diabetes.
