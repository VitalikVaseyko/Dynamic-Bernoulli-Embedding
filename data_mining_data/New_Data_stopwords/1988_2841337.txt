 Radiation inactivation method determine apparent target size molecules. report examined whether radiation inactivation various enzymes brain receptors influenced preparation samples preceding irradiation. apparent target sizes endogenous acetylcholinesterase pyruvate kinase rat brain rabbit muscle benzodiazepine receptor rat brain investigated detail. addition target sizes alcohol dehydrogenase (from yeast horse liver), beta-galactosidase (from Escherichia coli), lactate dehydrogenase (endogenous rat brain), 5-HT2 receptors, acetylcholine muscarine receptors, [35S] butyl bicyclophosphorothionate tertiary binding sites rat brain determined. results show apparent target sizes highly influenced procedure applied sample preparation irradiation. data indicate irradiation frozen whole tissue opposed lyophilized tissue frozen tissue homogenates estimate smallest relevant functional target size receptor enzyme.
