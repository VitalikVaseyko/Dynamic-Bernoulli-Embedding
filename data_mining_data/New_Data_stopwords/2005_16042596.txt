 3-deaza analogue TPP (thiamine diphosphate), close mimic ylid intermediate, synthesized extremely potent inhibitor variety TPP-dependent enzymes, binding much tightly TPP itself. Results using deazaTPP complexed E1 subunit PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) led novel proposal mechanism enzyme. 2-substituted forms deazaTPP, mimic intermediates catalytic mechanism, also synthesized 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)deazaTPP also extremely potent inhibitor PDC (pyruvate decarboxylase). Attachment 2-substituents expected way introduce selectivity inhibition various TPP-dependent enzymes.
