 Calcium-activated neutral protease (CANP) purified endogenous inhibitor activity monitored muscle Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients. specific activity enzyme found significantly higher compared normal. CANP platelets DMD patients significantly higher compared activities myopathies controls. Platelet CANP, therefore, may prove index pathological condition DMD, since myopathies show significant change.
