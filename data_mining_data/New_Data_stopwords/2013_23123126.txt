 report series neonates developed total serum bilirubin (TSB) >20mg/dL recent ten-year period multihospital healthcare system. incidence TSB >20mg/dL fell instituting pre-hospital discharge bilirubin screening program 2003/2004 (91.3 cases/10,000 births vs. 72.4/10,000 after), incidence subsequently remained unchanged. specific cause hyperbilirubinemia identified 66% (n=32) cases TSB >30 mg/dL 76% (n=112) cases TSB 25.0-29.9 mg/dL. hypothesized hemolysis common contributing mechanism, review hospital records indicated instances infants evaluated sufficiently test hypothesis. Records review showed maternal neonatal blood types direct antiglobulin testing performed >95% cases, rarely tests hemolysis obtained. ten-year period reviewed zero instances erythrocyte morphology blood film examination Heinz body evaluation pediatric hematologist pathologist performed. 3% cases pyruvate kinase tested, 3% evaluated hemoglobin electrophoresis, 3% haptoglobin measurement, 16% tested G6PD deficiency. Thus, determining cause hyperbilirubinemia neonates remains problem Intermountain Healthcare and, submit, elsewhere. result, majority infants TSB >25mg/dL specific causation identified. speculate cases involve hemolysis etiology could identified searched systematically. mind, propose "consistent approach" evaluating cause(s) hyperbilirubinemia among neonates TSB >25mg/dL.
