 1. Vanadium compounds mimic actions insulin alternative signalling pathways. effects three organic vanadium compounds studied non-ketotic, streptozotocin-diabetic rats: vanadyl acetylacetonate (VAc), vanadyl 3-ethylacetylacetonate (VEt), bis(maltolato)oxovanadium (VM). simple inorganic vanadium salt, vanadyl sulphate (VS) also studied. 2. Oral administration three organic vanadium compounds (125 mg vanadium element 1(-1) drinking fluids) 3 months induced faster larger fall glycemia (VAc potent) VS. Glucosuria tolerance glucose load improved accordingly. 3. Activities mRNA levels key glycolytic enzymes (glucokinase L-type pyruvate kinase) suppressed diabetic liver, restored vanadium treatment. organic forms showed greater efficacy VS, especially VAc. 4. VAc rats exhibited highest levels plasma tissue vanadium, likely due greater intestinal absorption. However, VAc retained potency given single i.p. injection diabetic rats. Moreover, relationship plasma tissue vanadium levels parameters glucose homeostasis hepatic glucose metabolism. Thus, data suggest differences potency compounds due differences insulin-like properties. 5. marked toxicity observed hepatic renal function. However, diarrhoea occurred 50% rats chronically treated VS, receiving organic compounds. 6. conclusion, organic vanadium compounds, particular VAc, correct hyperglycemia impaired hepatic glycolysis diabetic rats safely potently VS. simply due improved intestinal absorption, indicating potent insulin-like properties.
