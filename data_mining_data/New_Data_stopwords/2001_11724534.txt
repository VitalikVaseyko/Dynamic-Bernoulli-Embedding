 mechanism reversible transfer gamma-phosphate group ATP Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) substrate great interest. known metallofluorides accurate analogs transition state context kinase mechanisms. Therefore, two complexes PCK, one AlF(3), Mg(2+) ADP (complex I), AlF(3), Mg(2+), ADP pyruvate (complex II) crystallized. X-ray crystal structures two complexes determined 2.0 resolution. Al atom trigonal bipyramidal geometry mimics transition state phosphoryl transfer. Al atom distance 2.8 2.9 oxygen atom beta-phosphoryl group ADP complex II, respectively. water molecule complex oxygen atom pyruvate complex II located along axis trigonal bipyramid side opposite beta-phosphoryl oxygen respect equatorial plane, suggesting complexes close mimics transition state. Along presence positively charged species around AlF(3) moiety, results indicate phosphoryl transfer occurs via direct displacement mechanism associative qualities.
