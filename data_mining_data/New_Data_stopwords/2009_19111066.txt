 BACKGROUND: Several studies multiple ethnicities reported linkage type 2 diabetes chromosome 1q21-25. PKLR encoding liver pyruvate kinase NOS1AP encoding nitric oxide synthase 1 (neuronal) adaptor protein (CAPON) positioned within chromosomal region thus positional candidates observed linkage peak. C-allele PKLR rs3020781 T-allele NOS1AP rs7538490 reported strongly associate type 2 diabetes various European-descent populations comprising total 2,198 individuals combined odds ratio (OR) 1.33 [1.16-1.54] 1.53 [1.28-1.81], respectively. aim validate findings investigating impact two variants type 2 diabetes related quantitative metabolic phenotypes large study sample Danes. Further, intended expand analyses examining effect variants relation overweight obesity. METHODS: PKLR rs3020781 NOS1AP rs7538490 genotyped, using TaqMan allelic discrimination, combined study sample comprising total 16,801 16,913 individuals, respectively. participants ascertained four different study groups; population-based Inter99 cohort (nPKLR = 5,962, nNOS1AP = 6,008), type 2 diabetic patient group (nPKLR = 1,873, nNOS1AP = 1,874) Steno Diabetes Center, population-based study sample (nPKLR = 599, nNOS1AP = 596) Steno Diabetes Center ADDITION Denmark screening study cohort (nPKLR = 8,367, nNOS1AP = 8,435). RESULTS: case-control studies evaluated potential association rs3020781 rs7538490 type 2 diabetes obesity. significant associations observed type 2 diabetes (rs3020781: pAF = 0.49, = 1.02 [0.96-1.10]; rs7538490: pAF = 0.84, = 0.99 [0.93-1.06]). Neither show association overweight obesity. Additionally, PKLR NOS1AP genotypes demonstrated major influence diabetes-related quantitative metabolic phenotypes. CONCLUSION: failed provide evidence association PKLR rs3020781 NOS1AP rs7538490 type 2 diabetes, overweight, obesity related quantitative metabolic phenotypes large-scale studies Danes.
