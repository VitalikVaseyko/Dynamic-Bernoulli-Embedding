 rates loss adenylate kinase creatine kinase circulation intravenous injection homogenous chicken skeletal muscle enzymes examined determine role plasma clearance rates determining plasma levels enzymes normal dystrophic chickens. rapid clearance adenylate kinase activity (average half-life 5 min) slower biphasic clearance creatine kinase activity (average half-lives 0.95 11 hr) consistent elevation creatine kinase adenylate kinase blood plasma dystrophic chickens compared normal chickens. rates clearance enzymes similar normal chickens compared dystrophic chickens. Radioiodinated enzymes cleared similar, slightly rapid rates loss enzyme activity. loss adenylate kinase activity circulation may due part inactivation since adenylate kinase activity rapidly inactivated serum vitro, increase adenylate kinase activity observed specific sites clearance radioiodinated enzyme, liver spleen. comparison enzyme activities press juices activities high-ionic-strength homogenates muscle tissue normal dystrophic muscle, indicates adenylate kinase activity associated intracellular structures extent would prohibit release dystrophic muscle tissue. results, presented previously regard plasma levels clearance rates AMP aminohydrolase pyruvate kinase normal dystrophic chickens (11) support hypothesis rates loss muscle enzyme activities circulation important determining circulating levels muscle enzymes dystrophic chickens. Furthermore, measurement plasma levels clearance rates creatine kinase, estimated efflux rate creatine kinase dystrophic muscle tissue 2.0% total breast muscle creatine kinase per day.
