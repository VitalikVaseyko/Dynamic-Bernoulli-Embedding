 last decades considerable amount research focused cancer. number genetic signaling defects identified. allowed design screening number anti-tumor drugs therapeutic use. One main challenges anti-cancer therapy specifically target drugs malignant cells. Recently, tumor cell metabolism considered possible target cancer therapy. widely accepted tumors display enhanced glycolytic activity oxidative phosphorylation down-regulation (Warburg effect). Therefore, seems reasonable disruption glycolysis might promising candidate specific anti-cancer therapy. Nonetheless, concept aerobic glycolysis paradigm tumor cell metabolism challenged, tumor cells use oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria special interest cancer cell energy metabolism, physiology linked Warburg effect. Besides, central role apoptosis makes organelles promising "dual hit target" selectively eliminate tumor cells. Thus, desirable easy-to-use reliable model order screening energy metabolism-inhibiting drugs used cancer therapy. metabolic point view, fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae tumor cells share several features. paper review common metabolic properties discuss possibility using S. cerevisiae early screening test research novel anti-tumor compounds used inhibition tumor cell metabolism.
