 vascular smooth muscle cells, exposed hyperglycemia insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), SHPS-1 functions scaffold protein, signaling complex assembled leads AKT activation. However, underlying mechanism formation complex activates kinase phosphorylates AKT (Thr(308)) unknown. Therefore, investigated mechanism PDK1 recruitment SHPS-1 signaling complex consequences disrupting PDK1 recruitment downstream signaling. results show following IGF-I stimulation, PDK1 recruited SHPS-1, recruitment mediated Grb2, associates SHPS-1 via interaction Pyk2, component SHPS-1-associated complex. proline-rich sequence PDK1 bound Src homology 3 domain Grb2 response IGF-I. Disruption Grb2-PDK1 expression either Grb2 Src homology 3 domain PDK1 proline alanine mutant inhibited PDK1 recruitment SHPS-1, leading impaired IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr(308) phosphorylation. Following recruitment SHPS-1, PDK1 activated via Tyr(373/376) phosphorylation, required maximal increase PDK1 kinase activity AKT-mediated FOXO3a Thr(32) phosphorylation. PDK1 recruitment also required IGF-I prevent apoptosis occurred response hyperglycemia. Assembly Grb2-PDK1 complex SHPS-1 specific IGF-I signaling inhibiting PDK1 recruitment SHPS-1 effect EGF-stimulated AKT Thr(308) phosphorylation. findings reveal novel mechanism recruitment PDK1 SHPS-1 signaling complex, required IGF-I-stimulated AKT Thr(308) phosphorylation inhibition apoptosis.
