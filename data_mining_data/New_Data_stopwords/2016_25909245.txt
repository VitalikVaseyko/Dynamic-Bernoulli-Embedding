 top-down/bottom-up integrated proteomic approach based LC-MS 2-DE analysis applied comparative characterization medulloblastoma pilocytic astrocytoma posterior cranial fossa pediatric brain tumor tissues. Although rare, primary brain tumors frequent solid tumors pediatric age. Among medulloblastoma prevalent malignant tumor childhood pilocytic astrocytoma common, rarely showing malignant progression. Due limited availability kind sample, study applied pooled tumor tissues preliminary investigation. results showed different proteomic profiles two tumors evidenced interesting differential expression several proteins peptides. Top-down proteomics acid-soluble fractions brain tumor homogenates ascribed potential biomarker role malignancy beta- alpha-thymosins truncated proteoforms C-terminal truncated (des-GG) ubiquitin, resulting exclusively detected over-expressed highly malignant medulloblastoma. bottom-up proteomics acid-soluble fraction identified several proteins, common 2-DE analysis acid-insoluble pellets. Peroxiredoxin-1, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, triosephosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase PKM, tubulin beta alpha chains, heat shock protein HSP-90-beta different histones characterized medulloblastoma Ig kappa chain C region, serotransferrin, tubulin beta 2A chain vimentin pilocytic astrocytoma. two proteomic strategies, pros cons, well complemented characterizing proteome brain tumor tissues disclosing potential disease biomarkers validated future study individual samples tumor histotypes.
