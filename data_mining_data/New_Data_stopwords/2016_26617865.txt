 Reprogrammed metabolism hallmark cancer cells. Pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2), frequently up-regulated multiple human malignancies, demonstrated play critical function glucose metabolism, gene transcription tumorigenesis. However, limited knowledge known expression pattern prognostic value PKM2 colorectal cancer (CRC). study, first observed mRNA level PKM2 commonly up-regulated CRC tissues compared normal counterparts demonstrated data derived Oncomine database. Similar results also found 32 paired CRC tumor non-tumor specimens cohort 4 CRC cell lines. Furthermore, large scale immunohistochemical analysis tissue microarray containing 345 cases CRC specimens, demonstrated protein expression PKM2 expression up-regulated 79.4% (274/345) samples detected elevated PKM2 expression closely correlated enhanced TNM stage higher serum CEA level. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed CRC patients higher PKM2 expression poorer clinical outcome lower PKM2 expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed PKM2 TNM stage two independent prognostic factors overall survival rate CRC patients. Taken together, studies reveal prognostic value PKM2 CRC support PKM2 may act molecular target CRC treatment.
