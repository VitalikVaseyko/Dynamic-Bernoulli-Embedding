 glycolytic phenotype widespread phenomenon solid cancer forms, including breast cancer. Dichloroacetate (DCA) recently proposed novel relatively non-toxic anti-cancer agent reverse glycolytic phenotype cancer cells inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. examined effect DCA breast cancer cells, including highly metastatic vivo model. growth several breast cancer cell lines found inhibited DCA vitro. examination 13762 MAT rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells found reversal glycolytic phenotype DCA correlated inhibition proliferation without increase cell death. despite small significant increase caspase 3/7 activity, may sensitize cancer cells apoptotic triggers. vivo, DCA caused 58% reduction number lung metastases observed macroscopically injection 13762 MAT cells tail vein rats (P = 0.0001, n > = 9 per group). results demonstrate DCA anti-proliferative properties addition pro-apoptotic properties, effective highly metastatic disease vivo, highlighting potential clinical use.
