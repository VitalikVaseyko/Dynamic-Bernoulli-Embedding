 Various metabolic models studied computer simulation effort understand allowing reversibility reaction catalysed pyruvate kinase, normally considered irreversible practical purposes, significantly altered behaviour model glycolysis Trypanosoma brucei [Eisenthal, R. & Cornish-Bowden, A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 5500-5505]. Studies several much simpler models indicate enzymes catalysing early steps pathway must receive information concentrations metabolites end pathway model able reach steady state; treating internal steps reversible one way ensuring this. Feedback inhibition provides much better way, long feedback loops present model makes almost difference behaviour whether intermediate steps large equilibrium constants treated irreversible. absence feedback loops, ordinary product inhibition enzymes chain also transfer information; efficient regulating fluxes inefficient regulating intermediate concentrations. complicated patterns regulation, activation competing branch forcing flux parallel route, also serve degree ways passing information around irreversible step. However, normally less efficiently inhibition, extent enzyme pathway activated always upper limit (which may required), whereas enzymes inhibited completely saturating concentrations inhibitor.
