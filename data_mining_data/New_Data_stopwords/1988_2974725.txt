 ATPase activities measured 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, 1 mM ADP, 1 microM FCCP submitochondrial particles bovine heart stimulated delta mu H+-forming substrates particles whose natural inhibitor protein partially removed heating. activities linear time. particles, rate ATP hydrolysis 7-fold greater steady state. Pre-steady-state steady-state kinetic studies showed decrease ATPase activity due binding ADP high-affinity site enzyme (K0.5 10 microM). Inhibition ATP hydrolysis accompanied binding approximately 1 mol ADP/mol particulate F1; 10 microM ADP gave half-maximal binding. ADP could replaced IDP, affinity 50-fold lower (K0.5 0.5 mM). Maximal inhibition ADP IDP achieved less 5 s. Inhibition enhanced uncouplers. Even presence pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate, rates hydrolysis 2.5-fold higher first seconds reaction steady state. decrease ATPase activity also correlated binding nearly 1 mol ADP/mol F1. inhibitory ADP remained bound enzyme several thousand turnovers. Apparently, possible observe maximal rates hydrolysis first catalytic cycles enzyme.
