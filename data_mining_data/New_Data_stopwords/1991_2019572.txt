 identify DNA sequences cis-regulate expression rat liver pyruvate kinase (L-PK) genes, series constructs chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes driven various deleted fragments 3200 base pairs (bp) upstream L-PK gene cap site assayed transient expression introduction hepatoma HepG2 cells, rat hepatocytes primary culture, fibroblast LTK- cells, myogenic C2C12 cells, CHO cells. Four distinct regulatory domains characterized. proximal promoter region containing binding site hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) sufficient confer liver specificity, even presence ubiquitous enhancer. distal promoter region (-96 -283 bp) containing binding sites liver-specific factor A1 (LFA1), ubiquitous nuclear factor 1 (NF1), major late transcriptional factor (MLTF), far unidentified proteins binding L5-PK region essential maximally activate expression construct HepG2 cells. extinguisher region, located positions -2082 -1170 bp, decreases efficiency L-PK promoter HepG2 cells, hepatocytes primary culture. Finally, far upstream region (-2900 -2500 bp) seems correspond liver-specific DNase hypersensitive site behaves HepG2 cells activating sequence efficient absence extinguisher.
