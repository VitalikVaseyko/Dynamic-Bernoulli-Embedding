 Protein kinases clinically relevant, attractive drug targets cancer. One major problem kinase inhibitors broad promiscuity, causing off-target actions side effects. silico prediction targets compound would immensely facilitate accelerate drug development. Using virtual "inverse" screening approach, single compounds docked protein structures database, identify among known targets indirubin derivatives phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) target one derivative (6BIO) particular. prediction functionally supported vitro kinase assay, inhibition intracellular phosphorylation PDK1-substrates, inhibition endothelial cell migration, highly depends PDK1. Virtual inverse screening combined biological tests, thus, proposed valuable tool drug discovery process re-examination already established kinase inhibitors.
