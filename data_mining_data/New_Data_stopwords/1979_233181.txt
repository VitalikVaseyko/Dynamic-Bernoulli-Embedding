 dynamic pattern open reconstituted in-vitro enzyme system containing phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase adenylate kinase investigated. approach experimentally based stirred flow-through reactor. Stationary concentrations phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase maintained entrapment polyacrylamide gel particles. results fit theoretical model based initial kinetic responses enzymes involved. S-shaped steady state input characteristic fructose 6-phosphate experimentally obtained.
