 interaction bovine heart pyruvate kinase liposomes investigated various phospholipids function pH, salt concentration using steady-state kinetics ultracentrifugation. Liposomes made erythrocyte total lipid fraction individual phospholipids used. Pyruvate kinase specific activity increases upon interaction phospholipids. activation specifically sensitive presence phosphatidylserine liposomes. L-serine, phospho-L-serine main components phosphatidylserine head group show also activation effect. Efficient adsorption pyruvate kinase phosphatidylserine liposomes occurs pH range 6.0-8.0 low ionic strength. Interaction phosphatidylserine liposomes results change Vmax Km values phospho enol pyruvate without marked effect Km value ADP, Hill coefficients substrates. interaction seem influence cooperativity binding sites.
