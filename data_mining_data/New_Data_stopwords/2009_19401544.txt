 BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural mesothelioma effective treatments, one cytoreductive surgery. previously developed gene ratio test predict outcome malignant pleural mesothelioma patients undergoing surgery. study, investigated predictive value technical assay performance test patients malignant pleural mesothelioma. METHODS: Clinical data obtained prospectively 120 consecutive patients malignant pleural mesothelioma scheduled debulking surgery one institution. Specimens obtained surgery pleural biopsy examination. Expression data four genes collected tumor specimens, three ratios gene expression (TM4SF1/PKM2, TM4SF1/ARHGDIA, COBLL1/ARHGDIA) determined quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Patients assigned good poor outcome groups gene ratio test. Survival estimated Kaplan-Meier method log-rank test univariate analyses. multivariable Cox proportional hazards model used control prognostic factors. Technical robustness determined using 30 specimens per patient, two biopsy techniques, two performance sites. statistical tests two-sided. RESULTS: test predicted overall survival (P < .001) cancer-specific survival (P = .007) univariate analysis overall survival multivariable analysis (hazard ratio death = 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 3.45, P = .004). test reproducible within patients repeatable two determinations specimens widely varying tumor cell contents. Repeatability two determinations 88.5% (95% CI = 84.0% 92.2%) or, technically unacceptable test values excluded, 91.9% (95% CI = 87.4% 95.1%). Reproducibility two determinations 96.1% (95% CI = 86.5% 99.5%). Combining gene ratio test prognostic factors allowed prospective discrimination patients high risk (median survival = 6.9 months, 95% CI = 2.6 8.9 months; 3-year survival = 0%) low risk (median survival = 31.9 months, 95% CI = 21.9 41.7 months; 3-year survival = 42%). CONCLUSION: gene ratio test survival patients malignant pleural mesothelioma robust predictive value technical assay performance.
