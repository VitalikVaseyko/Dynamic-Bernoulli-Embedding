 Freshly drawn blood inhibited plasma coagulation, normal Ca++-concentration, lightly centrifuged produce platelet rich plasma (PRP). order minimize mixing various parts blood centrifugation, red cells centrifuged "cushion" albumin bottom tube. Platelets harvested different parts centrifuge tube exhibited different degrees activation, i.e. possessed different abilities aggregate tested afterwards aggregometer. Complete ADP scavenging centrifugation inhibited platelet activation, therefore assumed ADP released red cells centrifugation partly responsible this. ADP concentration hand could significantly reduced enzymatically without reducing activation platelets centrifuge, mechanical stimulation centrifugation postulated contributing factor. Prostaglandin synthesis inhibition centrifugation retarded activation platelets tube.
