 Cellular bioenergetics redox (reduction-oxidation) play important role cell proliferation differentiation, key aspects building new tissues. present study, examined metabolic characteristics human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) proliferation differentiation monolayer three-dimensional biomaterial scaffolds. monolayer, hASCs exhibited higher glycolysis lower ox-phos compared adipogenic osteogenic differentiated cells, hASCs demonstrated Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis). However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased adipogenic differentiation, decreased osteogenic differentiation. Similarly, decrease ROS levels along higher mitochondrial membrane potential viability observed hASCs encapsulated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels containing adhesion peptide (RGD), compared PEG hydrogels scrambled control peptide (GRD), demonstrating adhesion-dependent signaling also regulate ROS production bioenergetics. result, hypothesized could modulate osteogenesis PEG hydrogels containing adhesion peptide (RGD) reducing ROS levels using small therapeutic molecule, L-carnitine, metabolite purported antioxidant effects. observed reduced ROS levels, effect mitochondrial membrane potential, increased osteogenic differentiation tissue production cells presence L-carnitine. results suggest potential manipulate tissue production modulating cellular metabolism.
