 AS160 (Akt substrate 160 kDa) Rab GTPase-activating protein implicated insulin control GLUT4 (glucose transporter 4) trafficking. humans, truncation mutation (R363X) one allele AS160 decreased expression protein caused severe postprandial hyperinsulinaemia puberty. complement limited studies possible humans, generated AS160-knockout mouse. wild-type mice, AS160 expression relatively high adipose tissue soleus muscle, low EDL (extensor digitorum longus) muscle detectable liver enrichment. Despite lower blood glucose levels fasted random-fed conditions, AS160-knockout mice exhibited insulin resistance muscle liver euglycaemic clamp study. Consistent paradoxical phenotype, basal glucose uptake higher AS160-knockout primary adipocytes normal isolated soleus muscle, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake overall GLUT4 levels markedly decreased. contrast, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake GLUT4 levels normal EDL muscle. liver also contributes AS160-knockout phenotype via hepatic insulin resistance, elevated hepatic expression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase isoforms pyruvate intolerance, indicative increased gluconeogenesis. Overall, well catalytic function, AS160 influences expression proteins, loss deregulates basal insulin-regulated glucose homoeostasis, tissues normally express AS160, also influencing liver function.
