 Leakage mitochondrial oxidants contributes variety harmful conditions ranging neurodegenerative diseases cellular senescence. describe here, however, physiological heretofore unrecognized role mitochondrial oxidant release. Mitochondrial metabolism pyruvate demonstrated activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). metabolite-induced rise cytosolic JNK1 activity shown triggered increased release mitochondrial H(2)O(2). demonstrate turn, redox-dependent activation JNK1 feeds back inhibits activity metabolic enzymes glycogen synthase kinase 3beta glycogen synthase. such, results demonstrate novel metabolic regulatory pathway activated mitochondrial oxidants. addition, suggest although chronic oxidant production may deleterious effects, mitochondrial oxidants also function acutely signaling molecules provide communication mitochondria cytosol.
