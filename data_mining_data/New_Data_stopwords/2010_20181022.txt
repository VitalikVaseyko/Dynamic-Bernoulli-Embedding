 Emerging evidence indicates impaired cellular energy metabolism defining characteristic nearly cancers regardless cellular tissue origin. contrast normal cells, derive usable energy oxidative phosphorylation, cancer cells become heavily dependent substrate level phosphorylation meet energy demands. Evidence reviewed supporting general hypothesis genomic instability essentially hallmarks cancer, including aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), linked impaired mitochondrial function energy metabolism. view cancer primarily metabolic disease impact approaches cancer management prevention.
