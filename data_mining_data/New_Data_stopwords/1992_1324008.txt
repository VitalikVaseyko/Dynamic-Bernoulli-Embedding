 order elucidate effects amphotericin B (AMB) glycolytic pathway, metabolism [1-13C]glucose glucose-grown repressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae studied. cells aerobically suspended pyrophosphate solutions high potassium concentration without 10(-6) amphotericin B measurements made using 1H-, 13C-NMR spectroscopy biochemical methods. results compared obtained experimental conditions medium rich sodium salts containing antibiotic concentration. general presence 10(-6) AMB reduces glucose consumption ethanol production favouring glycerol trehalose formation. effects greatly reduced high K+ concentration used. AMB effects glucose consumption production ethanol, glycerol trehalose, observed suspension rich Na+, fairly well explained leakage K+ AMB membrane channels. outflux induces substantial decrease activity K(+)-dependent enzymes, aldolase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. intensities glutamate C2 C4 signals higher suspension rich Na+ suspension rich K+, suggesting Krebs cycle operates effectively solution rich Na+. absence AMB, passive diffusion glycerol cell membrane relatively slow apparently depends ionic external medium: efficient solutions high K+ high Na+ concentration. presence 10(-6) AMB, glycerol C1,3 resonance drastically decreases 20 min disappears noise. rapid disappearance suggests glycerol easily pass pores arising interaction AMB membrane sterols. However, rate pore formation slow, independent external medium (Na+ K+) process completed within 20 min.
