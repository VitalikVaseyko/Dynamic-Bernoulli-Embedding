 latex phagocytosis technique used prepare relatively pure plasma membranes inside-out orientation. method adapted number modifications order evaluate association glycolytic enzymes cytoplasmic side plasma membrane C6 glial cells. phosphorylation strictly coupled transport cells, glycolytic enzymes, especially hexokinase, could metabolize glucose close vicinity transporter. enzymes tested, hexokinase present considerable quantities membranes (nearly 40% homogenate specific activity), followed D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (10%), pyruvate kinase (8%), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (1%). Except hexokinase, enzyme pattern presented different published membrane preparations.
