 BACKGROUND: Brucellosis bacterial disease caused Brucella infection. late fifties, Brucella suis vaccine strain S2 reduced virulence obtained serial transfer virulent B. suis biovar 1 strain China. widely used vaccination China since 1971. now, mechanisms underlie virulence attenuation S2 still unknown. RESULTS: paper, whole genome sequencing S2 carried Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing method. performed comparative genomic analysis find differences S2 virulent Brucella suis strain 1330. found premature stops outer membrane autotransporter omaA eryD genes. Single mutations found phosphatidylcholine synthase, phosphorglucosamine mutase, pyruvate kinase FliF, reported related virulence Brucella bacteria. different proteins S2 1330, Omp2b, periplasmic sugar-binding protein, oligopeptide ABC transporter, definitive implications related bacterial virulence found, await investigation. CONCLUSIONS: data presented provided rational basis designing Brucella vaccines could used strains.
