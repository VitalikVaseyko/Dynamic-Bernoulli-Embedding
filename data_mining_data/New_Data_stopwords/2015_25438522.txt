 OBJECTIVE: investigate effects vitamin E (VE ) magnesium entantion glucolipid metabolism obese rats. METHODS: Seventy-four rats randomly divided five groups (normal control group positive E group, Mg group, plus Mg group). doses V(E) Mg 0.23 g/kg feed 0.31 g/kg feed respectively. slaughtered feed 67 weeks. Calculate lipid ratio. Examined level serum lipid, plasma glucose, serum insulin, insulin sensitivity index, activity hexokinase pyruvate kinase. results group analyzed One-Way ANOVA analysis variance factorial design. RESULTS: rat model nutritional obesity successfully established weight positive control group 20% higher normal control group. lipid ratio plasma triglyceride plus Mg group 13. 29% 0. 6 mmol/L respectively, significantly lower positive control group (17.24% 1. 18 mmol/L) (P < 0.05), plasma triglyceride plus Mg group significantly lower group (1. 07mmol/ L) (P <0.05). activity hexokinase V~E group plus Mg group 63. 67 U/L 64. 61 U/L respectively, significantly higher positive control group (42.79 U/L) Mg group (44.02 U/L) (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Supplementation combined Mg effectively improve fat content triglyceride obese rats, better alone. Supplementation Mg beneficial obese rats improve activity hexokinase, adding better Mg alone.
