 PURPOSE: Recently, new renal cell cancer syndrome linked germline mutation multiple subunits (SDHB/C/D) Krebs cycle enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase. report experience diagnosis, evaluation treatment novel form hereditary kidney cancer. MATERIALS METHODS: Patients suspected hereditary kidney cancer enrolled National Cancer Institute institutional review board approved protocol study inherited forms kidney cancer. Individuals families germline SDHB, SDHC SDHD mutations, kidney cancer underwent comprehensive clinical genetic evaluation. RESULTS: total 14 patients 12 SDHB mutation families evaluated. Patients presented renal cell cancer early age (33 years, range 15 62), metastatic kidney cancer developed 4 families manifestation kidney tumors. additional family 6 individuals found clear cell renal cell cancer presented young average age (47 years, range 40 53) identified germline SDHC mutation (R133X) Metastatic disease developed 2 family members. patient history carotid body paragangliomas aggressive form kidney cancer evaluated family germline SDHD mutation. CONCLUSIONS: SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma aggressive type kidney cancer, especially younger individuals. Although detection management early tumors often associated good outcome, based initial experience patients long-term experience hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma, recommend careful surveillance patients risk SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma wide surgical excision renal tumors.
