 Glioblastoma highly lethal cancer. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) potentially attractive therapeutic target eradication GSCs may impact tumor growth sensitize tumors conventional therapies. brain one metabolically active organs glucose representing important, only, source energy carbon. Like cancers, glioblastoma requires continuous source energy molecular resources new cell production preferential use aerobic glycolysis, recognized Warburg effect. selected metabolic nodes amenable therapeutic targeting, observed Warburg effect may causally contribute glioma heterogeneity. Editorial summarizes recent studies examine relationship GSCs metabolism briefly provides views future directions. ultimate goal establish new concept incorporating cellular hierarchical theory cellular evolution theory explain tumor heterogeneity. concept may better elucidate mechanisms tumors gain cellular molecular complexity guide us develop novel effective targeted therapies.
