 Clinical evidence shows tumor hypoxia independent prognostic indicator poor patient outcome. Hypoxic tumors altered physiologic processes, including increased regions angiogenesis, increased local invasion, increased distant metastasis altered apoptotic programs. Since hypoxia potent controller gene expression, identifying hypoxia-regulated genes means investigate molecular response hypoxic stress. Traditional experimental approaches identified physiologic changes hypoxic cells. Recent studies identified hypoxia-responsive genes may define mechanism(s) underlying physiologic changes. example, regulation glycolytic genes hypoxia explain characteristics Warburg effect. converse logic also true. identifying new classes hypoxia-regulated gene(s), infer physiologic pressures require induction genes protein products. Furthermore, physiologically driven hypoxic gene expression changes give us insight poor outcome patients hypoxic tumors. Approximately 1-1.5% genome transcriptionally responsive hypoxia. However, significant heterogeneity transcriptional response hypoxia different cell types. Moreover, coordinated change expression families genes supports model physiologic pressure leading expression changes. Understanding evolutionary pressure develop 'hypoxic response' provides framework investigate biology hypoxic tumor microenvironment.
