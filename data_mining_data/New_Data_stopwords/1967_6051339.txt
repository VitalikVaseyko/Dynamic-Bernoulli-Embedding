 glutamine synthetase Bacillus licheniformis obtained 15% purity. Sucrose gradient centrifugation gave molecular weight value approximately 612,000. l- d-glutamate utilized substrates biosynthetic reaction, although l isomer five times active. requirement adenosine triphosphate (ATP) partially replaced guanosine inosine triphosphates, cytidine uridine triphosphates. Mn(++) required activity, requirement cannot satisfied Mg(++). Maximal activity biosynthetic reaction observed ATP Mn(++) present equimolar amounts. excess either reactant gave less activity. However, purine pyrimidine nucleotides, added combination ATP, partially substitute ATP attaining equimolar ratio nucleotide Mn(++). complex ATP Mn(++) preferred form substrate. B. licheniformis enzyme catalyzes glutamyl transfer reaction much slower rate Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase. Either adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ATP activate glutamotransferase, although ADP active.
