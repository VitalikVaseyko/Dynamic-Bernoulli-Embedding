 investigated transduction pathway mediated Zn 17beta-estradiol isolated mantle/gonad cells mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. essential metal Zn, estrogen 17beta-estradiol, caused increase intracellular pH (pHi) isolated mantle/gonad cells mussel M. galloprovincialis, thus indicating activation Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE). observed effect inhibited EIPA (20 nM), specific NHE inhibitor, thus verifying NHE activation. Protein kinase C (PKC) also seemed play activating role zinc 17beta-estradiol effects NHE PK activity. addition, glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) increased zinc, decreased 17beta-estradiol treatment. noteworthy that, latter effects reversed presence EIPA, indicating involvement NHE signaling mechanism. cAMP seems participate signaling mechanism induced Zn induced 17beta-estradiol. potential implication heavy metal 17beta-estradiol reproductive activity marine animals discussed.
