 OBJECTIVE: describe new immunoprecipitation pattern identified Italian patients affected systemic sclerosis (SSc), corresponding pyruvate dehydrogenase antigen complex recognized anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). METHODS: Autoantibodies sera 85 patients SSc tested protein- RNA-immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot used determine identified proteins, medical records re-evaluated liver function tests PBC. RESULTS: 13/85 (15%) SSc sera, unique set 75-50-40-34kD proteins previously reported, noted. four proteins identified proteins X/E3BP, E1alpha, E1beta, E2/E3 pyruvate dehydrogenase antigen complex immunoprecipitation-Western blot. clinical record evaluation, 9/13 (69%) SSc patients new pattern positive AMA routine indirect immunofluorescence, 7/13 (54%) diagnosis PBC, 4/13 (31%) manifested biochemical signs cholestasis. Twelve 13 patients SSc AMA immunoprecipitation limited cutaneous form SSc anti-centromere antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: describe pattern 4 proteins 15% SSc patients, identified first time protein-immunoprecipitation. pattern corresponds serum AMA pyruvate dehydrogenase antigen complex must considered interpretation protein-immunoprecipitation results.
