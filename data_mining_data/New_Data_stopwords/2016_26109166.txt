 OBJECTIVE: investigate role skeletal muscle (SkM) interleukin (IL)-6 regulation adipose tissue metabolism. METHODS: Muscle-specific IL-6 knockout (IL-6 MKO) IL-6(loxP/loxP) (Floxed) mice subjected standard rodent diet (Chow), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD combination exercise training (HFD ExTr) 16 weeks. RESULTS: Total fat mass increased (P < 0.05) genotypes HFD. However, HFD IL-6 MKO mice lower (P < 0.05) inguinal adipose tissue (iWAT) mass HFD Floxed mice. Accordingly, iWAT glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein content, 5'AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK)(Thr172) phosphorylation, fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA content lower (P < 0.05) IL-6 MKO Floxed mice Chow. addition, iWAT AMPK(Thr172) hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)(Ser565) phosphorylation well perilipin protein content higher (P < 0.05) HFD IL-6 MKO HFD Floxed mice, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha (PDH-E1alpha) protein content higher (P < 0.05) HFD ExTr IL-6 MKO HFD ExTr Floxed mice. CONCLUSIONS: findings indicate SkM IL-6 affects iWAT mass regulation glucose uptake capacity well lipogenic lipolytic factors.
