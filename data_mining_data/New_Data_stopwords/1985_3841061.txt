 activity pyruvate kinase present crude extract bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei greatly increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, converted saturation curve phosphoenolpyruvate sigmoid hyperbola change V. Phosphate arsenate effect opposite fructose 2,6-bisphosphate apparent Ka fructose 2,6-bisphosphate shifted 75 nM 1.5 microM presence 5 mM phosphate. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate effects similar fructose 2,6-bisphosphate approximately 4000-fold higher concentrations. Pyruvate kinases Crithidia luciliae Leishmania major, two trypanosomatids like T. brucei containing glycosomes, also stimulated fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibited phosphate.
