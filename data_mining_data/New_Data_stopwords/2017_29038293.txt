 Pathologies including diabetes conditions exercise place unusual demand liver energy metabolism, demand induces state energy discharge. Hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) proposed inhibit anabolic processes gluconeogenesis response cellular energy stress. However, AMPK activation glucose release liver increased exercise. Here, sought test role hepatic AMPK regulation vivo glucose-producing citric acid cycle-related fluxes acute bout muscular work. used (2)H/(13)C metabolic flux analysis quantify intermediary metabolism fluxes sedentary treadmill-running mice. Additionally, liver-specific AMPK alpha1 alpha2 subunit KO WT mice utilized. Exercise caused increase endogenous glucose production, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis phosphoenolpyruvate. Citric acid cycle fluxes, pyruvate cycling, anaplerosis, cataplerosis also elevated exercise. Sedentary nutrient fluxes postabsorptive state comparable WT KO mice. However, increment endogenous rate glucose appearance exercise blunted KO mice diminished glycogenolytic flux. lower rate glycogenolysis associated lower hepatic glycogen content onset exercise prompted reduction arterial glucose exercise. results indicate liver AMPKalpha1alpha2 required maintaining glucose homeostasis acute bout exercise.
