 Ten patients, aged 39-61 years, hypomagnesaemia due chronic alcoholism (7 cases) malabsorption (3 cases), investigated assessing maximum isometric voluntary contraction force (MVC) quadriceps femoris muscle (7 cases), laboratory screening (9 cases) estimating electrolyte metabolite content biopsy specimens quadriceps femoris muscle. MVC ranged 0.5 34 kp significantly lower 12 apparently healthy normomagnesaemic controls (p less 0.001). results laboratory screening, apart significant lowering serum magnesium concentration (p less 0.01), mainly within range normal values, apart signs liver damage, elevated activity S-OCT (3 cases), alkaline phosphatease(3 cases), S-ALAT (1 case) elevation bilirubin blood ammonia (2 cases). Low serum iron-binding capacity occurred 4 cases, finding reported protein-calorie malnutrition. Muscle magnesium content significantly lower healthy controls (p less 0.001). Muslce sodium chloride contents significantly increased (p less 0.05). Total H2O content extracellular H2O content significantly increased (p less 0.05). Pyruvate lactate values within normal range. apparent equilibrium constant creatine kinase differed significantly ( less 0.01). ATP values within normal range, slight decreases ADP (p less 0.05) creatine phosphate ( less 0.01), whcih interest view lowering MVC diminished capacity sustained muscular effort hypomagnesaemic patients reported earlier.
