 BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) common primary malignant tumor bone children adolescents. However, biomarkers diagnostic significance established. recent years, high-throughput transcriptomic metabolomic approaches make possible studying levels thousands biomarkers simultaneously. METHODS: study, integrated two disparate transcriptomic metabolomic datasets find meaningful biomarkers used independent dataset test sensibility specificity biomarkers. RESULTS: using integrated two datasets, discovered biomarkers involved glycolysis pathway highly enriched, including 4 genes (ENO1, TPI1, PKG1 LDHC) 2 metabolites (lactate pyruvate). 4 genes significantly down-regulated OS samples well 2 metabolites. mixed metabolites + genes signature also outperformed metabolites genes alone, recall 0.813 F-measure 0.812. AUC value metabolites + genes classifier 0.825 (compared 0.58 metabolites 0.821 genes alone). CONCLUSION: findings establish integrated transcriptomic metabolomic signature used distinguish OS malignant good diagnostic accuracy superior methods.
