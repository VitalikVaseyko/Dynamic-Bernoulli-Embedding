 Chlamydia trachomatis obligate intracellular eubacteria dependent eukaryotic host cell variety metabolites. years, speculated chlamydiae energy parasites, totally dependent host cell ATP high-energy intermediates. determine whether C. trachomatis contains functional enzymes produce energy reducing power, four enzymes involved glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway, specifically pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, cloned, sequenced expressed recombinant proteins Escherichia coli. deduced amino acid sequences obtained show high homology pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymes. contrast numerous bacterial species, chlamydial glycolytic genes arranged operon, dispersed throughout genome. Results reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicate four genes maximally expressed middle chlamydial developmental cycle. chlamydial genes capable complementing mutant E. coli strains lacking respective enzyme activities. vitro enzyme analysis indicates recombinant chlamydial enzymes expressed E. coli active and, interestingly, recombinant chlamydial pyruvate kinase regulated allosterically fructose 1,6 bisphosphate AMP, found bacterial pyruvate kinases. summary, identification characterization glucose-catabolizing enzymes indicate chlamydia contains functional capacity produce ATP reducing power.
