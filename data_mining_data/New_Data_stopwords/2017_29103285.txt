 OBJECTIVE: experiment conducted investigate whether asparagine (Asn) could improve liver energy status weaning pigs challenged lipopolysaccharide. METHODS: Forty-eight weaned pigs (DurocxLarge WhitexLandrace, 8.12+/-0.56 kg) assigned four treatments: i) CTRL, piglets received control diet injected sterile 0.9% NaCl solution; ii) lipopolysaccharide challenged control (LPSCC), piglets received control diet injected Escherichia coli LPS; iii) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+0.5% Asn, piglets received 0.5% Asn diet injected LPS; iv) LPS+1.0% Asn, piglets received 1.0% Asn diet injected LPS. piglets fed experimental diets 19 d. 20, pigs injected intraperitoneally Escherichia coli LPS 100 mug/kg body weights volume 0.9% NaCl solution based assigned treatments. pigs slaughtered 4 h 24 h LPS saline injection, liver samples collected. RESULTS: 24 h LPS challenge, dietary supplementation 0.5% Asn increased ATP concentration (quadratic, p<0.05), tendency increase adenylate energy charges reduce AMP/ATP ratio (quadratic, p<0.1) liver. addition, Asn increased liver mRNA expression pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase beta (linear, p<0.05; quadratic, p<0.05), tendency increase mRNA expression hexokinase 2 (linear, p<0.1). Moreover, Asn increased liver phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK)/total AMP-activated protein kinase (tAMPK) ratio (linear, p<0.05; quadratic, p<0.05). However, 4 h LPS challenge, Asn supplementation effect parameters. CONCLUSION: present study indicated Asn could improve energy metabolism injured liver late stage LPS challenge.
