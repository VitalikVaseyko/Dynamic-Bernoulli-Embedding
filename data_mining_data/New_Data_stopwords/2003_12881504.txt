 Activities glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase (PFK), enolase, pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase determined extracts photoautotrophic, mixotrophic, heterotrophic cultures Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Annotated genomes Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 analyzed respective predicted physical properties enzyme investigated here. Enzymatic activity largely unaffected nutritional mode, exception glucokinase PK whose activities significantly elevated heterotrophic cultures Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. PFK activity insensitive bacterial PFK-A (allosteric) effectors PEP, implying Synechocystis PFK classified PFK-B (non-allosteric). Immunoblot kinetic studies indicated irrespective nutritional mode, Synechocystis PK corresponds PK-A (AMP activated) rather PK-F (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate activated).
