 investigated effect adding intermediate metabolites cell growth succinate production. yield succinic acid achieved highest 0.5 g/L phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) added. According metabolic network Actinobaccilus succinogenes NJ113, metabolic flux calculated metabolic flux analysis. ratio hexose monophosphate pathway glycolytic pathway increased 39.4:60.3 76.8:22.6 adding 0.5 g/L PEP, thus reducing power better balanced. flux PEP oxaloacetate 23.8% higher, made succinic acid flux improve 99.8 mmol/(g DCW x h) 124.4 mmol/(g DCW x h) flux acetic acid formic acid decreased 22.9% 15.4%, respectively. key enzyme activity analysis showed specific activity PEP carboxykinase reached 1910 U/mg 0.5 g/L PEP addition, 74.7% higher control; specific activity pyruvate kinase decreased 67.5%. Finally, concentration succinic acid 29.1 g/L yield 76.2%.
