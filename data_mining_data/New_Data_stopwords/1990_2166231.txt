Counter-current distribution aqueous two-phase systems cells populations shows displacement distribution profiles towards high-numbered cavities rotor animal ages. Heterogeneity cells distribution observed switching process fetal adult red cells taking place along postnatal stage development. Values pyruvate kinase/bisphosphoglycerate mutase ratio fractions suggest separation fetal (liver) adult (bone marrow) red cells.
