 Cancer cells consume large quantities glucose primarily use glycolysis ATP production, even presence adequate oxygen. metabolic signature (aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect) enables cancer cells direct glucose biosynthesis, supporting rapid growth proliferation. However, causes Warburg effect connection biosynthesis well understood. show tumour suppressor p53, frequently mutated gene human tumours, inhibits pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). PPP, p53 suppresses glucose consumption, NADPH production biosynthesis. p53 protein binds glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), first rate-limiting enzyme PPP, prevents formation active dimer. Tumour-associated p53 mutants lack G6PD-inhibitory activity. Therefore, enhanced PPP glucose flux due p53 inactivation may increase glucose consumption direct glucose towards biosynthesis tumour cells.
