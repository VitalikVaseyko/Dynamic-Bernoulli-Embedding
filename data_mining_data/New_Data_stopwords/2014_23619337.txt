 study designed investigate impact 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin (1,25(OH)2D) glucose metabolism early cancer progression. Untransformed ras-oncogene transfected (ras) MCF10A human breast epithelial cells employed model early breast cancer progression. 1,25(OH)2D modified response ras cells glucose restriction, suggesting 1,25(OH)2D may reduce ras cell glucose addiction noted cancer cells. understand 1,25(OH)2D regulation glucose metabolism, following four-day 1,25(OH)2D treatment, metabolite fluxes cell membrane measured nanoprobe biosensor, [(13)C6]glucose flux (13)C-mass isotopomer distribution analysis media metabolites, intracellular metabolite levels NMR, gene expression related enzymes assessed. Treatment 1,25(OH)2D reduced glycolysis flux glucose 3-phosphoglycerate reduced 15% (P=0.017) 32% (P<0.003) MCF10A ras cells respectively. ras cells, 1,25(OH)2D reduced lactate dehydrogenase activity 15% (P<0.05) concomitant 10% reduction flux glucose lactate (P=0.006), reduction level intracellular lactate 55% (P=0.029). Treatment 1,25(OH)2D reduced flux glucose acetyl-coA 24% (P=0.002) 41% (P<0.001), flux oxaloacetate 33% (P=0.003) 34% (P=0.027) MCF10A ras cells, respectively, suggesting reduction tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. results suggest novel mechanism involving regulation glucose metabolism 1,25(OH)2D may prevent breast cancer progression.
