 nucleotide sequence 6863-bp Spiroplasma citri DNA fragment comprising spiralin gene determined. Sequence analysis revealed eight putative ORFs encode ribosomal protein S2, elongation factor Ts, spiralin, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, three unidentified proteins (A, B, X). gene organization reported different previously published. Northern blot analysis rpsB, tsf, x transcripts indicates genes organized single transcriptional unit (operon). However, detection additional transcript corresponding rpsB gene alone suggests transcriptional mechanism occur 3' region rpsB gene, allowing conditional transcription termination.
