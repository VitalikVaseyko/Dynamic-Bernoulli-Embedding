 presence [gamma-32P]ATP bovine adrenal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex accepts label simultaneously becomes inactivated. suggests existence kinase composition complex typical complexes animal sources. Pi incorporated subunit molecular weight 42 000. kinase activity adrenal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex high: within first 20 sec incubation ATP inactivation high 60%. pH optimum kinase around 7.3. apparent Km value ATP 50 mM KCl 7 microM; absence KCl 10 microM. ADP competitive inhibitor kinase respect ATP (Ki = 100 microM), K+ present medium. Thiamine pyrophosphate pyruvate decrease rate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex inactivation.
