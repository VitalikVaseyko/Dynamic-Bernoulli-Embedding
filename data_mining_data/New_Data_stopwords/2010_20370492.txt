 Metabolic flexibility hallmark cancer. Although many tumors preferentially use glycolysis presence oxygen bioenergetic purposes (Warburg effect), effects glycolytic metabolism tumor metastasis investigated. employed extreme model glycolytic metabolism investigate ability metastatic B16 mouse melanoma cells grow primary subcutaneous tumors form lung tumors injected intravenously syngeneic immunocompromised mice. Mitochondrial gene-knockout B16rho degrees cells showed delayed subcutaneous tumor growth and, surprisingly, failed form lung tumors. results suggest mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) may required tumor metastasis.
