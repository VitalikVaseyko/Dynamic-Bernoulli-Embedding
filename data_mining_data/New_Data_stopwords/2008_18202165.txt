Maximal enzyme activities (V(max), mol.kg(-1).protein.h(-1)) measured homogenates tissue extracted vastus lateralis exercise repetitions 1 (R1), 2 (R2), 9 (R9), 16 (R16). mitochondrial enzymes, exercise resulted reductions (P < 0.05) cytochrome-c oxidase (COX, 14.6%), near significant reductions malate dehydrogenase (4.06%; P = 0.06) succinic dehydrogenase (4.82%; P = 0.09), near significant increases beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (4.94%; P = 0.08), change citrate synthase (CS, 2.88%; P = 0.37). cytosolic enzymes, exercise reduced (P < 0.05) V(max) hexokinase (Hex, 4.4%), creatine phosphokinase (9.0%), total phosphorylase (13.5%), phosphofructokinase (16.6%), pyruvate kinase (PK, 14.1%) lactate dehydrogenase (10.7%). Repetition-dependent reductions (P < 0.05) V(max) observed CS (R1, R2 > R16), COX (R1, R2 > R16), Hex (1R, 2R > R16), PK (R9 > R16). concluded heavy exercise results transient reductions wide range enzymes involved different metabolic functions case selected enzymes, multiple repetitions exercise reduce average V(max).
