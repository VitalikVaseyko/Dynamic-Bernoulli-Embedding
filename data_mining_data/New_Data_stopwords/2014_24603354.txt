 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes dramatic growth transition unicellular form filamentous state, marked formation pseudohyphal filaments elongated connected cells. Yeast pseudohyphal growth regulated signaling pathways responsive reductions availability nitrogen glucose, molecular link pseudohyphal filamentation glucose signaling fully understood. Here, identify glucose-responsive Sks1p kinase signaling protein required pseudohyphal growth induced nitrogen limitation coupled nitrogen/glucose limitation. identify Sks1p signaling network, applied mass spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics, profiling 900 phosphosites phosphorylation changes dependent upon Sks1p kinase activity. analysis, report set novel phosphorylation sites highlight Sks1p-dependent phosphorylation Bud6p, Itr1p, Lrg1p, Npr3p, Pda1p. particular, analyzed Y309 S313 phosphosites pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit Pda1p; residues required pseudohyphal growth, Y309A mutants exhibit phenotypes indicative impaired aerobic respiration decreased mitochondrial number. Epistasis studies place SKS1 downstream G-protein coupled receptor GPR1 G-protein RAS2 upstream level cAMP-dependent PKA. pseudohyphal growth glucose signaling transcription factors Flo8p, Mss11p, Rgt1p required achieve wild-type SKS1 transcript levels. SKS1 conserved, deletion SKS1 ortholog SHA3 pathogenic fungus Candida albicans results abnormal colony morphology. Collectively, results identify Sks1p important regulator filamentation glucose signaling, additional relevance towards understanding stress-responsive signaling C. albicans.
