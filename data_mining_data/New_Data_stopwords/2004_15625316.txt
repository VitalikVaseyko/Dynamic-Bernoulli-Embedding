 pyruvate kinases Genus Bacillus bacteria extra C-terminal sequence phosphoenolpyruvate binding motif composed 110 amino acids. elucidate possible structure function sequence, enzyme lacking sequence prepared characterized. N-terminal sequences peptides, found lysylendopeptidase digest wild enzyme truncated enzyme, determined. determined sequences found extra C-terminal sequence deduced DNA sequence. truncated enzyme showed decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate allosteric effector ribose 5-phosphate, reduced thermostability. properties, tetrameric structure, specific activity, allosteric characteristics unchanged. comparison CD spectra truncated enzyme recombinant enzyme indicated structure C-terminal sequence rich beta-sheet. findings suggest sequence actually exists may form steady domain interacting A-domain C-domain, catalytic domain allosteric effector binding domain, respectively.
