 Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) fat-reducing effect, little information available whether DHEA regulates glucose metabolism, would turn affect fat deposition. investigate effects DHEA glucose metabolism, rats administered high-fat diet containing either 0 (HCG), 25 (HLG), 50 (HMG), 100 (HHG) mg.kg-1 DHEA per day via gavage 8 weeks. Results showed long-term administration DHEA inhibited body weight gain rats high-fat diet. statistical differences serum glucose levels observed, whereas hepatic glycogen content HMG HHG groups muscle glycogen content HLG HMG groups higher HCG group. Glucokinase, malate dehydrogenase phosphofructokinase-2 activities HMG HHG groups, pyruvate kinase succinate dehydrogenase activities HMG group, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity DHEA treatment groups increased compared HCG group. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glycogen phosphorylase mRNA levels decreased HMG HHG groups, whereas glycogen synthase-2 mRNA level increased HMG group compared HCG. abundance Glut2 mRNA HMG HHG groups Glut4 mRNA HMG group higher HCG group. DHEA treatment increased serum leptin content HMG HHG groups compared HCG group. Serum insulin content insulin receptor mRNA level HMG group insulin receptor substrate-2 mRNA level HMG HHG group increased compared HCG group. Furthermore, Pi3k mRNA level HMG Akt mRNA level HMG HHG groups significantly increased HCG group. data showed DHEA treatment could enhance glycogen storage accelerate glucose catabolism rats fed high-fat diet, effect may associated activation PI3K/Akt-PFK-2 signaling pathway.
