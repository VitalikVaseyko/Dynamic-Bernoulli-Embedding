 Several lines evidence support view bioenergetic function mitochondria postmitotic tissue deteriorates normal aging. Skeletal muscle one tissue undergoes age-related fiber loss atrophy age-associated rise number cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficient fibers. metabolic pressure placed skeletal muscle would obvious advantage supplement cellular requirement energy up-regulating glycolysis, alternative pathway energy synthesis. Analysis rat skeletal muscle utilizing antibodies directed key enzymes involved glycolysis provided evidence age-associated increase enzymes involved glycolysis. Fructose-6-phosphate kinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase protein levels appeared increase soleus, gracilis, quadriceps muscle aged rats. increase level proteins appeared correlate corresponding decrease amount cytochrome c oxidase protein measured tissue. Together results interpreted represent general upregulation glycolysis occurs response age-associated decrease mitochondrial energy capacity. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage mutations may accumulate advancing age reach threshold level impinge bioenergy capacity cell tissue. Evidence indicates mtDNA skeletal muscle aged rats humans undergoes changes nucleotide sequence level (mutations DNA damage), also undergoes modifications tertiary level generate unique age-related conformational mtDNA species. One particular age-related conformational form detected aged rat tissues high demands respiration, specifically heart, kidney, soleus muscle, and, lesser extent, quadriceps muscle. age-related form detected gracilis muscle predominantly dependent upon glycolysis regard energy requirements. Finally, comprehensive hypothesis presented features stochastic nature mitochondrial system. basis hypothesis dynamic relationship exists endogenous mutagen production, DNA repair, mtDNA turnover, nuclear control mtDNA copy number age-associated changes dynamics relationship lead loss functional full-length mtDNA eventually leads bioenergy decline.
