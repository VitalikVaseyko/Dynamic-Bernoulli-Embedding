 dUTP pyrophosphatase, preventive DNA repair enzyme, contributes maintain appropriate cellular dUTP/dTTP ratio catalyzing dUTP hydrolysis. dUTPase essential viability bacteria eukaryotes alike. Identification species-specific antagonists bacterial dUTPases expected contribute development novel antimicrobial agents. first general step, design dUTPase inhibitors based modifications substrate dUTP phosphate chain, modifications either base sugar moieties strongly impair ligand binding. Based structural differences bacterial human dUTPases, derivatization dUTP-analogous compounds required second step invoke species-specific character. Studies performed dUTP analogues also offer insights substrate binding characteristics important structurally peculiar enzyme. study, alpha,beta-methylene-dUDP synthesized complex dUTPase characterized. Enzymatic phosphorylation substrate analogue pyruvate kinase possible contrast successful enzymatic phosphorylation alpha,beta-imino-dUDP. One explanation finding different bond angles presence methylene group may preclude formation catalytically competent complex kinase. Crystal structure E. coli dUTPase:alpha,beta-methylene-dUDP E. coli dUTPase:dUDP:Mn complexes determined analyzed comparison previous data. Results show "trans" alpha-phosphate conformation alpha,beta-methylene-dUDP differs catalytically competent "gauche" alpha-phosphate conformation imino analogue oxo substrate, manifested shifted position alpha-phosphorus 3 A. three-dimensional structures determined work show binding methylene analogue alpha-phosphorus "gauche" conformation would result steric clash methylene group protein atoms. addition, metal ion cofactor bound crystal complex methylene analogue clearly visible coordinated dUDP, arguing altered phosphate chain conformation also perturbs metal ion complexation. Isothermal calorimetry titrations indicate binding affinity alpha,beta-methylene-dUDP toward dUTPase drastically decreased compared dUDP. conclusion, present data suggest alpha,beta-methylene-dUDP seems practically nonhydrolyzable, strong binding inhibitor dUTPase probably due altered binding mode phosphate chain. Results indicate cases methylene analogues may faithfully reflect competent substrate ligand properties, especially methylene hydrogens steric conflict protein.
