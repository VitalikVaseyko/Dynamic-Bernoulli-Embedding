 Characteristic tumor microenvironment fluctuating gradients reduced nutrient levels released lactate. fundamental issue tumor cells modulate metabolic activity glucose glutamine levels become limiting presence high exogenous lactate. functional analyses, activities pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) plasma membrane NADH oxidase (NOX) well cell growth measured breast cancer MCF-7 cells cultured medium containing various concentrations metabolites. 3 days glucose concentrations 2.5 mM, cell number higher 0.1 mM 1.0 mM glutamine, indicating glucose/glutamine balance important growth. hand, NOX activity increased increasing glucose >2.5 mM, low glutamine (0.1 mM). Pyruvate kinase activity also increased, LDH activity remaining 2-3-fold lower. NOX could complementary role reoxidizing NADH glycolysis. Exogenous lactate supported cell survival limiting concentrations glucose glutamine increasing NOX pyruvate kinase activities well NADH levels. proposed lactate supports cell survival fuelling gluconeogenesis and/or TCA cycle mitochondria, NADH could shuttled cytosol reoxidized NOX. Cell survival metabolic phenotype thus interrelated dynamics NADH plasma membrane NOX activity, regulated balance glucose/glutamine levels, conjunction lactate precarious tumor microenvironment.
