 hypothesized dysregulation lactate/pyruvate (monocarboxylate) transporters (MCT) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoforms contribute Warburg effect cancer. Therefore, assayed expression levels localizations MCT (1, 2, 4), LDH (A B) isoforms breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 MDA-MB-231 compared results control, untransformed primary breast cell line, HMEC 184. Remarkably, MCT1 expressed MDA-MB-231, MCT1 expressed MCF-7 cells, abundance less control HMEC 184 cells. present HMEC 184 MCF-7 cells, MCT1 localized plasma membrane. MCT2 MCT4 expressed cell lines studied. MCT4 expression higher MDA-MB-231 compared MCF-7 HMEC 184 cells, whereas MCT2 abundance higher MCF-7 compared MDA-MB-231 HMEC 184 cells. Unlike MCT1, MCT2 MCT4 localized mitochondria addition plasma membrane. LDHA LDHB expressed cell-lines, abundances higher two cancer cell lines control cells. MCF-7 cells expressed mainly LDHB, MDA-MB-231 control cells expressed mainly LDHA. LDH isoforms localized mitochondria addition cytosol. localization patterns cancerous control cell lines. conclusion, MCT LDH isoforms distinct expression patterns two breast cancer cell lines. differences may contribute divergent lactate dynamics oxidative capacities cells, offer possibilities targeting cancer cells.
