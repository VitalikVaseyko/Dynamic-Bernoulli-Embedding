 shallow teleosts low organic osmolyte contents, e.g. 70 mmol/kg less trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). previous work showed TMAO contents increase depth muscles several Pacific families teleost fishes, 180 mmol/kg wet wt 2.9 km depth grenadiers. report abyssal grenadiers (Coryphaenoides armatus, Macrouridae) Atlantic 4.8 km depth contain 261 mmol/kg wet wt muscle tissue. precisely fits linear trend extrapolated earlier data. also found anemones show trend increasing contents methylamines (TMAO, betaine) scyllo-inositol increasing depth. Previously found TMAO counteracts inhibitory effects hydrostatic pressure variety proteins. report TMAO and, lesser extent, betaine, generally better stabilizers common osmolytes (myo-inositol, taurine glycine), terms counteracting effects pressure NADH Km grenadier lactate dehydrogenase ADP Km anemone rabbit pyruvate kinase.
