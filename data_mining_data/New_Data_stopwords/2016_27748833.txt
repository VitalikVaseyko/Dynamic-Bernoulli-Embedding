 Warburg effect describes ability cancer cells produce energy via aerobic glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation pyruvate. deviation mitochondrial metabolism inhibits apoptosis, allowing increased proliferation conditions reduced oxygen levels. Dichloroacetate (DCA) successfully used several human cancer cell lines reactivate oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria. aim study characterization response canine cancer cell lines DCA exposure. effect 10 mM DCA characterized vitro set six canine prostate adenocarcinoma transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) derived cell lines. Cell counts, lactate levels, apoptosis, expression apoptotic proteins, survival factors different miRNAs analyzed. Additionally, metabolic activity, mitochondrial activity proliferation investigated. DCA significantly decreased cell number one utilized cell lines leads significant reduction lactate release. Decreased survivin levels found cell lines, two presented significant reduction metabolic activity. Increased miR-375 levels measured TCC cell lines. Reactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase elevated mitochondrial activity appear induce transition aerobic glycolysis back oxidative phosphorylation. Further, results display DCA treatment suppressant effect proliferation canine cancer cells.
