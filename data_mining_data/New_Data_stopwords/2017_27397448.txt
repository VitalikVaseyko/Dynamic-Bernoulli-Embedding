 OBJECTIVES: investigate release pattern different cardiac metabolites biomarkers directly coronary sinus (CS) establish diagnostic discrimination limits marker protein metabolites evaluate perioperative myocardial injury patients undergoing cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). PATIENTS METHODS: Sixty-eight patients undergoing first mitral and/or aortic valve replacements with/without coronary artery bypass grafting Bentall procedure CPB blood cardioplegic arrest studied. cardiac metabolites biomarkers measured serial CS-derived blood samples pre-CPB, immediate post aortic declamping, 10 minutes post-CPB 12 hrs post-CPB. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis cardiac biomarkers indicated lactate-pyruvate ratio superior diagnostic discriminator myocardial injury optimal "cut-off" value >10.8 immediately aortic declamping (AUC, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85-0.98). Lactate second best diagnostic discriminator myocardial injury optimal "cut-off" value >2mmol/l immediately aortic declamping (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80-0.96). Cardiac troponin-I third best diagnostic discriminator myocardial injury optimal "cut-off" value >2.1ng/ml immediately aortic declamping (AUC, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80-0.95). Creatine kinase-MB fourth best diagnostic discriminator myocardial injury optimal "cut-off" value >58 log units/ml prior decanulation (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.78-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Measurable cardiac damage exists patients undergoing cardiac surgery cardioplegic arrest. degree myocardial injury patients poor ventricular function requiring longer aortic clamp time. CS-derived lactate-pyruvate ratio, lactate, cTn-I served superior diagnostic discriminators peri-operative myocardial damage.
