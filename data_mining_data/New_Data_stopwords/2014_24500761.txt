 Warburg's metabolic hypothesis based assumption cancer cell's respiration must attack, leading damage, order obtain increased glycolysis. Although may apply cancers, evidence proving primarily abnormally functioning mitochondrial complexes indeed related cancer development. Thus, mutations complex II (succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)) lead formation pheochromocytoma (PHEO)/paraganglioma (PGL). Mutations one SDH genes (SDHx mutations) lead succinate accumulation associated low fumarate levels, increased glutaminolysis, generation reactive oxygen species, pseudohypoxia. results significant changes signaling pathways (many dependent stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor), including oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, specific expression profiles, well genomic instability increased mutability resulting tumor development. Although currently effective therapy SDHx-related metastatic PHEOs/PGLs, targeting fundamental metabolic abnormalities may provide unique opportunity development novel effective forms therapy tumors.
