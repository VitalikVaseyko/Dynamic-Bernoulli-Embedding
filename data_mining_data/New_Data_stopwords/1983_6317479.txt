 protein species precipitated rat liver cytosol rabbit antisera raised pure L-type pyruvate kinase investigated sodium dodecyl sulphate gel electrophoresis. primary antisera (anti-L-type pyruvate kinase) precipitated protein species mol. wts 56,000, 41,000 39,000. 41,000 mol. wt protein identified fructose-bis-phosphatase. Double diffusion immunotitration experiments established L-type pyruvate kinase fructose-bis-phosphatase shared common antigenic determinants. information enabled improved antiserum (anti-LPK) obtained. use anti-LPK showed 56,000 mol. wt subunit catalytically immunologically active form L-type pyruvate kinase liver. confirmed biosynthetic experiments cultured hepatocytes. specific activity enzyme liver extracts also determined quantitative immunotitration anti-LPK. Despite changes dietary status varied concentration enzyme protein, maximum specific activity enzyme remained constant essentially pure enzyme.
