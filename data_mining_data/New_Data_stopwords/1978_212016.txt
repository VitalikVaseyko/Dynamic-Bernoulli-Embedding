 1. conversion inactive (phosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex active (dephosphorylated) complex pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase inhibited heart mitochondria prepared alloxan-diabetic 48h-starved rats, mitochondria prepared acetate-perfused rat hearts mitochondria prepared normal rat hearts incubated respiratory substrates 6 min (as compared 1 min). 2. conclusion based experiments isolated intact mitochondria pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase reaction inhibited pyruvate ATP depletion (by using oligomycin carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone), experiments rate conversion inactive complex active complex phosphatase measured extracts mitochondria. inhibition phosphatase reaction seen constant concentrations Ca2+ Mg2+ (activators phosphatase). phosphatase reaction mitochondrial extracts inhibited excess exogenous pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate used substrate. concluded inhibition due factor(s) associated substrate (pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate complex) inhibition phosphatase such. 3. conclusion verified isolating pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate complex, free phosphatase, hearts control diabetic rats heart mitochondria incubed 1min (control) 6min respiratory substrates. rates re-activation inactive complexes measured preparations ox heart rat heart phosphatase. rates lower (relative controls) inactive complex hearts diabetic rats heart mitochondria incubated 6min respiratory substrates. 4. incorporation 32Pi inactive complex took 6min complete rat heart mitocondria. extent incorporation consistent three four sites phosphorylation rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. 5. suggested phosphorylation sites additional inactivating site may inhibit conversion inactive complex active complex phosphatase heart mitochondria alloxan-diabetic 48h-starved rats mitochondria incubated 6min respiratory substrates.
