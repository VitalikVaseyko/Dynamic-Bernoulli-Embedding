 Efficient energy utilization essential cell growth; attempt improve growth conditions rat T-lymphocyte culture model potential use studying mutagenic activity carcinogens vitro, investigated effects phytohemagglutinin (PHA), interleukin-2 (IL-2) 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) activities intermediary metabolism enzymes cell proliferation. Isolated lymphocytes cultured presence absence PHA, IL-2, 2-ME. intermediary metabolism enzymes investigated glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, fatty acid synthetase (FAS). Measurable activity enzymes investigated, except FAS, detected PHA-stimulated cells cultured IL-2 2-ME. unstimulated lymphocytes significantly lower enzyme activity stimulated cells. combination three agents showed increased enzyme activity. increase activity brought combination three agents reproduced either agent acting alone. general, increase enzyme activity correlated cell proliferation measured [3H]thymidine uptake PHA-stimulated cultures containing IL-2 and/or 2-ME. results suggest addition exogenous IL-2 2-ME enhances metabolic function may beneficial vitro culture rat lymphocytes.
