 reported study three candidate genes may involved non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 4 (PDK4), Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) Fatty Acid Binding Protein 2 (FABP2). reported mutation three candidate genes tested 179 black subjects Dakar (Senegal) PCR-RFLP techniques. significant difference control NIDDM subjects. genotype frequency senegalese population quite similar compared reported frequency white populations excepted PDK4 polymorphism. results suggest none gene variants major NIDDM predisposing locus negroid population Senegal.
