 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Use second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) results development obesity type 2 diabetes-like syndrome. hypothesised that, addition insulin resistance associated obesity, SGAs might acute effects glucose metabolism could contribute derangements glucose metabolism. METHODS: investigated effects therapeutically relevant levels three different antipsychotic medications (haloperidol, quetiapine clozapine) glucose tolerance, measures insulin resistance hepatic glucose production, insulin glucagon secretion rats. RESULTS: found drugs induce impaired glucose tolerance rats associated increased insulin secretion (clozapine>quetiapine>haloperidol) independent weight gain. However, Akt/protein kinase B activation normal, levels drug effect insulin action fat cells soleus muscle, effect insulin sensitivity evaluated insulin tolerance tests. show clozapine induces increased glucose levels following pyruvate glycerol challenges, indicating increase hepatic glucose output (HGO). Increased HGO would turn increase insulin release would explain apparent phenotype mimicking insulin resistance. provide evidence effect could least part mediated stimulation glucagon secretion. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: findings indicate SGAs cause acute derangements glucose metabolism caused direct induction insulin resistance act via increase glucagon secretion thus stimulation hepatic glucose production.
