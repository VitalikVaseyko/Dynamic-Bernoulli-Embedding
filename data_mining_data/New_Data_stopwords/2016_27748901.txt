 Hematological abnormalities frequently observed patients liver cirrhosis (LC). previous study demonstrated apoptosis damage endothelial cells could cause hematological abnormalities LC. Protein kinases one important factors regulate cell behavior, potential therapeutic targets treatment number diseases. previous study, whole genome profiling used identify differentially expressed genes human bone marrow endothelial cells treated serum 26 patients LC. data set, present study identified 14 differentially expressed kinase genes human bone marrow endothelial cells LC microarray data, including p38a, AKT1 PDK1. Pathway analysis revealed kinase genes enriched certain important LCassociated pathways (e.g. MAPK WNT signaling pathway). Literature mining revealed p38a associated bone marrow apoptosis; therefore, p38a inhibitor, SB203580, selected potential therapeutic targets present study. results hematoxylineosin Masson's trichrome staining livers rat model liver fibrosis (LF) underwent ligation bile duct demonstrated SB203580 reduced degree LF. addition, SB203580treated rats LF demonstrated significantly higher number platelets compared untreated group. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis indicated apoptosis bone marrow tissue rats LF inhibited SB203580. addition, results immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated SB203580 reduced expression von Willebrand factor caspase 3 bone marrow rats LF. conclusion, results present study indicate p38a kinase inhibitor, SB203580, may exhibit protective effect bone marrow tissues rats LF. suggests protein kinases inhibitors may present novel therapeutic strategies treatment hematological abnormalities patients LC.
