 BACKGROUND: Evolution deuterostome lineage accompanied increase systematic complexity especially regard highly specialized tissues organs. Based observation increased number paralogous genes vertebrates compared invertebrates, two entire genome duplications (2R) proposed early evolution vertebrates. glycolytic enzymes occur several copies vertebrate genomes, specifically expressed certain tissues. Therefore, glycolytic pathway particularly suitable testing theories involvement gene/genome duplications enzyme evolution. RESULTS: assembled datasets genomic databases least nine vertebrate species least three outgroups (one deuterostome two protostomes), used maximum likelihood Bayesian methods construct phylogenies 10 enzymes glycolytic pathway. approach, intended gain insights vertebrate specific evolution enzymes glycolytic pathway. Many obtained gene trees generally reflect history two rounds duplication vertebrate evolution, agreement hypothesis additional duplication event within lineage teleost fish. retention paralogs differed greatly genes, direct link multimeric structure active enzyme found. CONCLUSION: glycolytic pathway subsequently evolved gene duplication divergence constituent enzyme taxon-specific individual gene losses lineage-specific duplications. tissue-specific expression might led increased retention genes since paralogs subdivide ancestral expression domain find new functions, necessarily related original function.
