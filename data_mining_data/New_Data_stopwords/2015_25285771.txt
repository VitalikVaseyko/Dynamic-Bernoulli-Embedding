 PFOS toxic, persistent environmental pollutant widespread worldwide. PFOS contamination entered food chain interfering normal development man neurotoxic, hepatotoxic tumorigenic. earthworm, Eisenia fetida one organisms help diagnose soil health contamination lower levels food chain. Studying chronic effects sub-lethal PFOS exposure organism therefore appropriate. PFOS bioaccumulates easily biodegraded, biomagnified food chain. Gene expression studies give us information develop biomarkers early diagnosis soil contamination, well contaminant passes food chain. carried mRNA sequencing control chronically PFOS exposed E. fetida reconstructed transcripts silico identified differentially expressed genes. findings suggest PFOS up/down regulates neurodegenerative-related human homologues cause neuronal damage E. fetida. information help understand links neurodegenerative disorders environmental pollutants PFOS. Furthermore, up/down regulated genes used biomarkers detect sub-lethal presence PFOS soil. Neuronal calcium sensor-2, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, polyadenylate-binding protein-1 mitochondrial Pyruvate dehydrogenase protein-X component, could potential biomarkers sub lethal concentrations PFOS.
