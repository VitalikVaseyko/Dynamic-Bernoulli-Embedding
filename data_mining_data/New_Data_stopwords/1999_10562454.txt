 Digestive gland cells isolated mussels (Mytilus) previously demonstrated respond mammalian EGF cytosolic Ca(2+) transient stimulated DNA synthesis; responses mediated activation tyrosine kinase receptors. present study examines mechanisms involved signal progression possible targets phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes. effects EGF, IGF-I, insulin activity two key glycolytic enzymes PFK (phosphofructokinase) PK (pyruvate kinase) evaluated. peptides tested induced transient dose-dependent stimulation activity PFK PK, involved activation MAPKs. Quantitative immunoelectron microscopy, utilizing monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, revealed EGF induced transient increase tyrosine phosphorylation. results demonstrate that, marine invertebrate cells, activation tyrosine kinase membrane receptors growth factors triggers signal transduction pathways involving phosphorylative cascade similar mammalian cells. Moreover, data suggest that, mussel cells, growth factors may play physiological role vivo regulation glucose metabolism modulating, reversible phosphorylation, activity key glycolytic enzymes.
