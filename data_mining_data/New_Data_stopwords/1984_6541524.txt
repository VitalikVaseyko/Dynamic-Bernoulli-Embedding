 protein substrate specificity calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity cytosolic fraction bovine heart examined. Prior experiments, kinase activity purified 50-fold recovery greater 10% homogenate activity. Two endogenous protein substrates molecular weight 57,000 73,000 phosphorylated kinase preparations. kinase preparation also able phosphorylate exogenous synapsin, phospholamban, glycogen synthase, MAP-2, myelin basic proteins kappa-casein, tubulin, pyruvate kinase, regulatory subunit cAMP protein kinase II, myosin light chain phosphorylase b. High levels calmodulin required activation kinase activity toward 57,000 73,000 molecular weight endogenous substrates (K0.5 = 93 +/- 5 nM), glycogen synthase (K0.5 = 127 +/- 10 nM), kappa-casein (K0.5 = 321 +/- 107 nM). kinase possessed high affinity glycogen synthase (half maximal activity 0.9 +/- 0.4 microM) low affinity kappa-casein (21 +/- 2 microM). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation separated calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity two fractions apparent molecular weights approximately 900,000 100,000. fractions phosphorylated endogenous 57,000 molecular weight substrate glycogen synthase similarly. results indicate cardiac calmodulin-dependent protein kinase previously observed phosphorylate endogenous protein substrate possesses wide range substrate specificity.
