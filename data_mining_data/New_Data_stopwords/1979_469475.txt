 Pyruvate kinase exists two major isozymes coho salmon. mammals birds, one form present early embryo maintains wide tissue distribution adults. salmonid type K shows anodal migration electrophoresis pH 7.5. appearence functional musculature developing embryos. adult animals second form pyruvate kinase muscle. Brain, kidney, liver gill contain primarily type K pyruvate kinase heart contains major forms along three intermediate forms presumably constitute hybrid set. Since additional isozyme restricted gluconeogenic tissues, conclude type L isozyme developed animals. two major isozymes immunologically distincy. forms dubject fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activation phosphoenolpyruvate binding, magnitude effect small. affinities phosphoenolpyruvate similar, salmon type K hyperbolic saturation curves substrate type sigmoidal saturation curves. immunological data indicates considerable divergence structure, kinetic parameters two forms remained relatively similar.
