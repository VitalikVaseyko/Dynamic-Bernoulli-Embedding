 Published retrospective studies seem indicate neonatal haemolytic anaemia due erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency followed severe chronic haemolysis. present study 13 children 11 different families, developed haemolytic anaemia associated pyruvate kinase deficiency first hours life followed periods 1 10 years. 4 children signs haemolysis disappeared within less 6 months; genetic studies showed heterozygous congenital deficiency. Among remaining 9 children, double heterozygous, 4 developed moderate, well tolerated haemolysis require blood transfusions splenectomy; 5 remained severely anaemic required repeated transfusions and, 3 cases, splenectomy. neonatal period clinical, haematological biological evidence prognosis would different three groups children. genetic studies separated simple heterozygous others. 5 13 children severe chronic evolutive haemolytic anaemia suggests poor prognosis neonatal haemolytic jaundice due pyruvate kinase deficiency reconsidered.
