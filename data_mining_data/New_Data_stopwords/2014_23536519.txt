 aim study examine antitumour activity resveratrol human colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 Caco2) explore mechanism action assuming calorie-restriction effect. Resveratrol inhibited proliferation colon cancer cells half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) equal 50 130 muM HCT116 Caco2, respectively. Caco2 cells appeared significant time-dependent increase glycolytic pathway, behaviour absent HCT116 cells. Resveratrol (100 muM) significantly decreased glycolytic enzymes (pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase) Caco2 cells, increase citrate synthase activity decrease glucose consumption observed cell lines. Moreover, resveratrol downregulated expressions leptin c-Myc, decreased content vascular endothelial growth factor. apoptotic markers, caspases 3 8, activated Bax/BCl2 ratio increased. study suggested promising anticancer activity resveratrol, calorie-restriction pathway may one driving forces activity.
