 OBJECTIVE: Features metabolic syndrome central obesity insulin resistance dyslipidemia typical signs Cushing's syndrome common side effects prolonged glucocorticoid treatment. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), key regulatory enzyme lipid carbohydrate metabolism well appetite, involved development deleterious metabolic effects excess glucocorticoids, data available humans. current study, demonstrate effect high glucocorticoid levels AMPK activity human adipose tissue samples patients Cushing's syndrome. METHODS: AMPK activity mRNA expression genes involved lipid metabolism assessed visceral adipose tissue removed abdominal surgery 11 patients Cushing's syndrome, nine sex-, age-, weight-matched patients adrenal incidentalomas, visceral adipose tissue four patients non-endocrine-related abdominal surgery. RESULTS: patients Cushing's syndrome exhibited 70% lower AMPK activity visceral adipose tissue compared incidentalomas control patients (P = 0.007 P < 0.001, respectively). Downstream targets AMPK fatty acid synthase phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase up-regulated patients Cushing's syndrome. AMPK activity inversely correlated 0900 h serum cortisol urinary free cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: data suggest glucocorticoids inhibit AMPK activity adipose tissue, suggesting novel mechanism explain deposition visceral adipose tissue consequent central obesity observed patients iatrogenic endogenous Cushing's syndrome.
