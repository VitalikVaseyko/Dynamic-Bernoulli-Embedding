 identified eight individuals Amish population Geauga County, Ohio, congenital hemolytic anemia red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. mutant enzyme low Km phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) variant associated slower (77.5% normal) electrophoretic mobility starch gel. high consanguinity population, assume affected individuals homozygous mutant gene. Genealogical records allow us trace eight cases back common ancestor lived Mifflin County, Pennsylvania. sister common ancestor cases PK deficiency originally described Pennsylvania Amish isolate.
