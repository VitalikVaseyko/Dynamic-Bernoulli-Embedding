 article demonstrates surface volume measurements individual human erythrocytes varying shapes obtained scanning electron micrographic stereopairs using approach based established principles photogrammetry. Instead calculating coordinates several hundred points plotted cell, procedure proves tedious time-consuming, show reasonable approximation cell surface volume achieved simple geometrical models constructed small number carefully measured points angles, using stereocomparator. values obtained two normal erythrocytes two distorted red cells patient congenital pyruvate kinase deficiency haemolytic anaemia consistent available information geometry cells. scanning electron microscopy requires extensive manipulation cells, values obtained cannot applied fresh living material, appear fairly accurate purpose comparison cells prepared manner.
