 Previous studies demonstrated cisplatin-induced acute renal failure, significant reduction proximal tubule fatty acid oxidation. report effects peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha) ligand Wy-14643 (WY) abnormalities medium chain fatty acid oxidation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity kidney tissue cisplatin-treated mice. Cisplatin causes significant reduction mRNA levels enzyme activity mitochondrial medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). PPAR alpha ligand WY ameliorated cisplatin-induced acute renal failure prevented cisplatin-induced reduction mRNA levels enzyme activity MCAD. contrast, cisplatin-treated PPAR alpha null mice, WY protect kidney function reverse cisplatin-induced decreased expression MCAD. Cisplatin inhibited renal PDC activity development acute tubular necrosis, PDC inhibition reversed pretreatment PPAR alpha agonist WY. Cisplatin also induced increased mRNA protein levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4), PPAR alpha ligand WY prevented cisplatin-induced increased expression PDK4 protein levels wild-type mice. conclude PPAR alpha agonists therapeutic potential cisplatin-induced acute renal failure. Use PPAR alpha ligands prevents acute tubular necrosis ameliorating cisplatin-induced inhibition two distinct metabolic processes, MCAD-mediated fatty acid oxidation PDC activity.
