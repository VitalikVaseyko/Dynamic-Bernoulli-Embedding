 reprogramming cellular metabolism cancer cells well-documented effect. previously shown common oncogene expression induce aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. However, direct effect inflammatory microenvironment cancer cell metabolism known. Here, illustrate treatment nonmalignant (MCF-10a) malignant (MCF-7) breast epithelial cells low-level (10 ng/ml) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) significantly increased glycolytic reliance, lactate export expression glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). TNF-alpha decreased total mitochondrial content; however, oxygen consumption rate significantly altered, suggesting overall mitochondrial function increased. Upon glucose starvation, MCF7 cells treated TNF-alpha demonstrated significantly lower viability nontreated cells. Interestingly, properties partially reversed coincubation anti-inflammatory agent curcumin dose-dependent manner. work demonstrates aerobic glycolysis directly induced inflammatory microenvironment independent additional genetic mutations signals adjacent cells. Furthermore, identified natural dietary compound reverse effect.
