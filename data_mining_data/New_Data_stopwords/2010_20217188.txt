 Although metformin used treat type 2 diabetes several decades, mechanism action glucose metabolism remains controversial. assess effect metformin glucose metabolism work undertaken investigate acute actions metformin glycogenolysis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, ureogenesis perfused rat livers. Metformin (5 mM) inhibited oxygen consumption increased glycolysis glycogenolysis livers fed rats. perfused livers fasted rats, drug (concentrations higher 1.0 mM) inhibited oxygen consumption glucose production lactate pyruvate. Gluconeogenesis ureogenesis alanine also inhibited. cellular levels ATP decreased metformin whereas AMP levels livers fasted rats increased. Taken together results indicate energy status cell probably compromised metformin. antihyperglycemic effect metformin seems result reduced oxidative phosphorylation without direct inhibition key enzymatic activities gluconeogenic pathway. AMP-activated protein kinase cascade could also probable target metformin, switches catabolic pathways glycogenolysis glycolysis, switches ATP consuming processes.
