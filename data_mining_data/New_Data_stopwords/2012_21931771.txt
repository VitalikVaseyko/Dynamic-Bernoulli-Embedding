 BACKGROUND: major area effort current genomics distinguish mutations functionally neutral contribute disease. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) amino acid substitutions currently account approximately half known gene lesions responsible human inherited diseases. result, prediction non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) affect protein functions relate disease important task. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: study, performed comprehensive analysis deleterious SNPs functional structural level respective genes associated red blood cell metabolism disorders using bioinformatics tools. analyzed variants Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) isoforms Pyruvate Kinase (PKLR & PKM2) genes responsible major red blood cell disorders. Deleterious nsSNPs categorized based empirical rule support vector machine based methods predict impact protein functions. Furthermore, modeled mutant proteins compared native protein evaluation protein structure stability. SIGNIFICANCE: argue bioinformatics tools play important role addressing complexity underlying genetic basis Red Blood Cell disorders. Based investigation, report potential candidate SNPs, future studies human Red Blood Cell disorders. Current study also demonstrates presence deleterious mutations also endorses vivo experimental studies. approach present application computational tools understanding functional variation perspective structure, expression, evolution phenotype.
