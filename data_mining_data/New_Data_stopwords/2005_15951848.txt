 paper report regulation Aspergillus niger growth rate citric acid fermentation stirred tank bioreactor. this, influence dissolved oxygen concentration medium intracellular pH values consequently overall microbial metabolism emphasized. Intracellular pH mycelium grown different concentrations dissolved oxygen medium determined. Sensitivity proteins toward proton concentration well recognized, therefore pH influences activities key regulatory enzymes Aspergillus niger determined pH values similar detected cells grown lower dissolved oxygen concentrations. results shown significantly reduced specific activities hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase acidic environment, pyruvate kinase found relatively insensitive towards higher proton concentration. expected, due reduced specific activities regulatory enzymes acidic conditions, overall metabolism hindered medium lower dissolved oxygen concentration confirmed detecting reduced specific growth rates. studies, conclude dissolved oxygen concentration affects intracellular pH thus growth rate Aspergillus niger fermentation process.
