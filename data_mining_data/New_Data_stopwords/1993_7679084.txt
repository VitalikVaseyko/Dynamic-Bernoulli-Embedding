 Estradiol treatment starving immature rainbow trout dramatically alters metabolic performance isolated hepatocytes. One two weeks postimplantation estradiol, rate de novo glucose synthesis [14C]alanine reduced fourfold 0.4 mumol/g/hr 0.1 mumol/g/hr, compared vehicle-injected control fish. 6 weeks, rate glucose production gram wet weight basis identical treatment groups, significantly larger (by 80%) estradiol-treated group controls, expressed normalized hepatosomatic index (HSI). Estradiol treatment caused preferential partitioning alanine carbon oxidative pathways away gluconeogenesis, indicated significantly lower ratio glucose production CO2 production hepatocytes isolated estradiol-treated animals. Incorporation [14C]alanine acid-precipitable protein significantly larger estradiol-treated group 2 weeks, also 6 weeks, normalized HSI, indicating part protein synthesized estradiol-treated groups vitellogenin. differences detected estradiol-treated animals control animals activities enzymes associated gluconeogenesis [phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase)] amino acid metabolism (alanine aspartate aminotransferases) time course investigated (expressed wet weight basis). Activities normalized HSI higher fish implanted estradiol compared controls 2 6 weeks. keeping increased potential hepatocytes CO2 production alanine, estradiol treatment doubled tripled maximum activity pyruvate kinase 1 2 weeks postimplantation, respectively. Fish fasted avoid erratic feeding due treatments. Superimposed estradiol actions effects starvation: fourfold increase rate gluconeogenesis, threefold increase oxidative flux, fivefold increase activity FBPase--all normalized hepatocyte weight.
