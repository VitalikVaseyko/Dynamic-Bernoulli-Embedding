 Regulation diurnal circadian rhythms cell proliferation coupled mammals, including humans. However, molecular mechanisms diurnal circadian rhythms regulate cell proliferation relatively poorly understood. study, report tumor growth nude rats bearing human steroid receptor-negative MCF-7 breast tumors significantly accelerated exposing rats light night (LAN). normal conditions alternating light/dark cycle, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) levels tumors maximal early light phase remained low levels throughout daily 24-hour cycle period monitored. Surprisingly, PCNA expressed tumors continually high level throughout entire 24-hour period LAN-exposed nude rats. Daily fluctuations Akt mitogen activated protein kinase activation tumors also disrupted LAN. fluctuations track PCNA changes, found activation Akt stimulatory kinase phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) directly correlated PCNA levels. Expression insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), upstream signaling molecule PDK1, also correlated fluctuations PDK1/PCNA LAN group. addition, circulating IGF-1 concentrations elevated LAN-exposed tumor-bearing nude rats. Finally, RNAi-mediated knockdown PDK1 led reduction PCNA expression cell proliferation vitro tumor growth vivo, indicating PDK1 regulates breast cancer growth manner correlated PCNA expression. Taken together, findings demonstrate LAN exposure accelerate tumor growth vivo, part continuous activation IGF-1R/PDK1 signaling.
