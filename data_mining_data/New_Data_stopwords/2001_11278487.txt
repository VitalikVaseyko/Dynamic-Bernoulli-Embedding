 study undertaken examine mechanistic significance two highly conserved residues positioned active site pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, Glu-243 His-239. used site-directed mutagenesis convert Glu-243 Ala, Asp, Gln His-239 Ala. resulting mutant kinases demonstrated greatly reduced capacity phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase. Glu-243 Asp mutant approximately 2% residual activity, whereas Glu-243 Ala Gln mutants exhibited less 0.5 0.1% residual activity, respectively. Activity His-239 Ala mutant decreased approximately 90%. Active-site titration [alpha-(32)P]ATP revealed neither Glu-243 His-239 mutations affected nucleotide binding. mutant kinases showed similar even somewhat greater affinity wild-type kinase toward protein substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Furthermore, neither mutations affected inter-subunit interactions. Finally, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase found possess weak ATP hydrolytic activity, required Glu-243 His-239 similar kinase activity. Based observations, propose mechanism according invariant glutamate residue (Glu-243) acts general base catalyst, activates hydroxyl group serine residue protein substrate direct attack gamma phosphate. glutamate residue turn might polarized interaction neighboring histidine residue (His-239).
