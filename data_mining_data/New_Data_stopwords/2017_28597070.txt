 shift cancer cells toward aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) confers selective advantages utilizing nutrients (e.g., lipids, amino acids, nucleotides) build biomass. Lipogenesis generally enhanced, inhibition diminishes proliferation survival. Re-expression metastasis suppressor KISS1 human melanoma cells results greater mitochondrial biogenesis, inhibition glycolysis, utilization beta-oxidation provide energy, elevated oxidation exogenous fatty acids, increased expression early-phase lipogenesis genes mRNA protein levels. Correspondingly, energy sensor AMPKbeta phosphorylated, resulting inhibitory phosphorylation acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), linked enhanced beta-oxidation. Furthermore, PGC1alpha required KISS1-mediated phosphorylation ACC metastasis suppression. Collectively, data support linkages macromolecular metabolism metastasis. KEY MESSAGES: * KISS1 alters fatty acid metabolism. * may connections metastasis metabolism. * PGC1alpha appears downstream mediator KISS1 metastasis suppression.
