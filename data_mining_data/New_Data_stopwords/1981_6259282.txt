 activities uridine kinase (EC 2.7.1.48), uridine monophosphate (UMP) kinase (EC 2.7.1.3.14), uridine diphosphate (UDP) kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) measured retinal high-speed supernatant fractions following unilateral optic nerve crush goldfish. enzyme activities followed similar time course, initial increases 2-3 days following nerve crush, peak activity 4 days, gradual return basal levels day 21. magnitude stimulation day 4 35% case. Activities two enzymes intermediary metabolism, pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) lactic dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), altered, indicating coordinate increases nucleoside nucleotide kinase activities specific responses nerve injury. increased labeling could explained altered phosphohydrolytic activities. nature enhancement studied UDP kinase, active kinases examined. Neither low-molecular-weight components substrate availability could account observed increase UDP kinase 4 day post-crush retinas. Km UDP unaltered, mixing experiment support possibility stimulatory inhibitory factors played role. enhancement UDP kinase activity blocked injection actinomycin following nerve crush. results suggest observed increases enzymes uridine metabolism result increased formation following nerve crush.
