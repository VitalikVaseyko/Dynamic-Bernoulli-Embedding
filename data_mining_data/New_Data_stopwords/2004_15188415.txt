 still ongoing sequencing Bacillus licheniformis Gottingen Sequencing Laboratory provides basis proteome studies bacterium. using two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis protein identification mass spectrometry, able create master gels B. licheniformis cells grown either minimal medium complex medium containing 300 180 entries, respectively. DECODON Delta 2D software identified abundant protein spots gels, shown perform mainly basic metabolic functions cell translation, amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Based master gels, able study regulation metabolic pathways glycolysis TCA cycle. cells grown presence glucose significant increase amount glycolytic enzymes (TpiA, GapA, Pgk, Pgm, Eno, Pyk) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PdhA-D) found. time, strong repression almost TCA cycle enzymes ATP synthase. Glucose also stimulates acetate kinase (AckA) phosphotransacetylase (Pta) known involved overflow metabolism B. subtilis. Furthermore, began developing proteomic signatures growth B. licheniformis complex medium. purpose, compared proteome pattern exponentially growing cells cells different stages stationary phase. obvious proteomic signature indicates cells stationary phase subjected severe oxidative stress resulting protein stress. Furthermore, level many vegetative proteins strongly reduced growth arrested entry stationary phase. data indicate proteomics valuable tool describe physiological state B. licheniformis cell populations, e.g., cells growing bioreactor.
