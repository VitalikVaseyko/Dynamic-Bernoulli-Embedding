 Myoblasts human skeletal muscle isolated needle biopsy samples vastus lateralis fused differentiated multinucleated myotubes. Specific high-affinity insulin insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) binding, glucose transporter proteins GLUT1 GLUT4, glycogen synthase pyruvate dehydrogenase proteins, specific mRNAs identified fused myotubes. Insulin IGF-I stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake twofold half-maximal stimulation insulin 0.98 +/- 0.12 nmol/l maximal stimulation 17.5 nmol/l. Acute insulin treatment (33 nmol/l) doubled glycogen synthase activity glucose incorporation glycogen increasing pyruvate dehydrogenase approximately 30%. cells cultured NIDDM subjects, basal (6.9 +/- 1.0 vs. 13.0 +/- 1.7 pmol.mg protein-1.min-1) acute insulin-stimulated transport (13.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 22.4 +/- 1.3 pmol.mg protein-1.min-1) significantly reduced compared nondiabetic control subjects (both P < = 0.005). GLUT1 protein content total membranes NIDDM subjects decreased compared control subjects, GLUT4 levels similar groups. significant correlation (r = 0.65, P < = 0.05) present maximal rates insulin-stimulated glucose transport cell culture subjects compared corresponding vivo glucose disposal determined hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp. summary, differentiated human skeletal muscle cultures exhibit biochemical molecular features insulin-stimulated glucose transport intracellular enzyme activity comparable vivo situation. Defective insulin-stimulated glucose transport persists muscle cultures NIDDM subjects resembles reduced insulin-mediated glucose uptake present vivo. conclude technique provides relevant cellular model study insulin action glucose metabolism normal subjects determine mechanisms insulin resistance NIDDM.
