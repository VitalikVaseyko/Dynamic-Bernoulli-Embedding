 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 encoded viral protein Vpr essential infection macrophages HIV-1. Furthermore, macrophages resistant cell death viral reservoir. However, impact Vpr macrophage proteome yet comprehended. goal present study use stable-isotope labeling amino acids cell culture (SILAC) coupled mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach characterize Vpr response macrophages. Cultured human monocytic cells, U937, differentiated macrophages transduced adenovirus construct harboring Vpr gene. 600 proteins quantified SILAC coupled LC-MS/MS approach, among 136 significantly altered upon Vpr overexpression macrophages. Quantified proteins selected clustered biological functions, pathway network analysis using Ingenuity computational pathway analysis. proteomic data illustrating increase abundance enzymes glycolytic pathway (pentose phosphate pyruvate metabolism) validated western blot analysis. addition, proteomic data demonstrate regulation key mitochondrial enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (GLUD2), adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) transketolase (TKT). Based observations postulate HIV-1 hijacks macrophage glucose metabolism pathway via Vpr-hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) axis induce expression hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate dehyrogenase (G6PD) pyruvate kinase muscle type 2 (PKM2) facilitates viral replication biogenesis, long-term survival macrophages. Furthermore, dysregulation mitochondrial glutamate metabolism macrophages contribute neurodegeneration via neuroexcitotoxic mechanisms context NeuroAIDS.
