 Abnormal metabolism sustained proliferation hallmarks cancer. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) metabolic enzyme plays important roles processes. Recently, PKM2 shown protein kinase activity phosphorylating histone H3 promoting cancer cell proliferation. However, mechanism extent protein kinase cancer cells remain unclear. Here, report binding succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose-5'-phosphate (SAICAR), metabolite abundant proliferating cells, induces PKM2's protein kinase activity vitro cells. Protein microarray experiments revealed 100 human proteins, mostly protein kinases, phosphorylated PKM2-SAICAR. particular, PKM2-SAICAR phosphorylates activates Erk1/2, turn sensitizes PKM2 SAICAR binding phosphorylation. Additionally, PKM2-SAICAR necessary induce sustained Erk1/2 activation mitogen-induced cell proliferation. Thus, ligand-induced protein kinase activity PKM2 mechanism directly couples cell proliferation intracellular metabolic status.
