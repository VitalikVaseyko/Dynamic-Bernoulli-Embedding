 Genome-wide association (GWA) studies described large number new candidate genes contribute Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). cases, small clusters genes implicated, rather single gene, cases, genetic contribution defined effects specific organ, pancreas liver. significant need develop use human cell-based models examine effects genes may glucose regulation. describe development primary human hepatocyte model adjusts glucose disposition according hormonal signals. model used determine whether candidate genes identified GWA studies regulate hepatic glucose disposition siRNAs corresponding list identified genes. find several genes affect storage glucose glycogen (glycolytic response) and/or affect utilization pyruvate, critical step gluconeogenesis. genes affect processes, CAMK1D, TSPAN8 KIF11 affect localization mediator gluconeogenesis glycolysis regulation, CRTC2, nucleus response glucagon. addition, gene CDKAL1 observed affect glycogen storage, molecular experiments using mutant forms CDK5, putative target CDKAL1, HepG2 cells show mediated coordinate regulation CDK5 PKA MEK, ultimately regulates phosphorylation ribosomal protein S6, critical step insulin signaling pathway.
