 gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) pyruvate carboxylase (PC) glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK), regulating pyruvate metabolism, determined livers 71 fetuses, developed 25 dams 80th, 100th, 106th, 112th day gestation (length: 115 days) Caesarean section. comparative purposes enzymes estimated 12 naturally born piglets immediately delivery. period examination (the last third gestation) total activity PEPCK highest values 80th day, PC PK activity 100th day gestation. activities 3 enzymes decrease last 2 weeks gestation birth. cytosolic part PEPCK amounts 10-15 per cent total activity develops parallel manner. newborn piglets decline PC total PEPCK activity observed, cytosolic PEPCK activity remains constant, therefore relative proportion increases 25% total activity. PK activity rises distinctly (1.5 times). role enzymes carbohydrate metabolism fetus, especially gluconeogenesis, discussed detail.
