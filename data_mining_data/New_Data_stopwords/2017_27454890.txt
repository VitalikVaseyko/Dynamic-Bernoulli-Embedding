 identified genes encoding proteins transport glucose maltose Neisseria meningitidis strain 2C4-3. mutant deleted NMV_1892(glcP) longer grew glucose deletion NMV_0424(malY) prevented utilization maltose. also purified characterized glucokinase alpha-phosphoglucomutase, catalyze early catabolic steps two carbohydrates. N. meningitidis catabolizes two carbohydrates either via Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway pentose phosphate pathway, thereby forming glyceraldehyde-3-P either pyruvate fructose-6-P, respectively. purified characterized several key enzymes two pathways. genes required transformation glucose gluconate-6-P catabolism via ED pathway organized two adjacent operons. N. meningitidis also contains genes encoding proteins exhibit similarity gluconate transporter (NMV_2230) gluconate kinase (NMV_2231) Enterobacteriaceae Firmicutes. However, gluconate might real substrate NMV_2230 N. meningitidis able grow gluconate sole carbon source. Surprisingly, deletion NMV_2230 stimulated growth minimal medium presence absence glucose drastically slowed clearance N. meningitidis cells transgenic mice intraperitoneal challenge.
