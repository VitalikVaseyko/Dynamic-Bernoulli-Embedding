 beta-Alanine occurs naturally human central nervous system performs different functions. act either neurotransmitter neuromodulator, depletion taurine levels competitive antagonist gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). beta-amino acid accumulation exerts important biological function delay brain development, oxidative stress disturbances energy metabolism, characterized inborn error metabolism classified beta-alaninemia. evaluated effects chronic administration beta-alanine parameters oxidative stress enzymes energy metabolism cerebral cortex cerebellum 21-day-old Wistar rats. animals received peritoneal injections beta-alanine (300 mg/kg body weight), controls received volume (10 mul/g body weight) saline solution (NaCl 0.9%), twice day 12-h interval, 7th 21st postpartum day. observed beta-amino acid able increase levels reactive oxygen species (ROS) two tissues; however, cerebral cortex total content sulfhydryl increased. ROS possibly acting antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (cerebral cortex cerebellum) superoxide dismutase (SOD) (cerebellum) inhibiting activities. also evaluated activities enzymes phosphoryl transfer network, observed increase hexokinase cytosolic creatine kinase (Cy-CK) activities; however, decreased glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, tissues. Besides, beta-alanine administration increased activities complex II, complex IV succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). results suggest chronic administration beta-alanine causes cellular oxidative damage, significantly changing energy metabolism.
