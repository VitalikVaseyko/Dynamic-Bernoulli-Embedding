 vitamin E activity acetates three 2RS-n-alkyl-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-6-hydroxychroman analogs alpha-tocopherol measured compared directly all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, indirectly via 2R,4'R,8'R-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, using rat curative myopathy, plasma pyruvate kinase assay. analogs alkyl chain lengths 11 13 carbons activities differ significantly (p greater 0.05) also differ all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate. finding indicates methyl branching phytyl tail 4', 8', 12' positions little influence upon vitamin E activity. Thus physical interactions involving methyl branches phytyl tail polyunsaturated moieties membrane phospholipids unimportant vivo, insofar bioassay concerned. However, length hydrocarbon tail important. indicated result obtained acetate analog alkyl chain length 15 carbon atoms 15% activity 2R,4'R,8'R-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, i.e., 22% activity all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate since form 1.47 times less active 2R,4'R,8'R-alpha-tocopheryl acetate curative myopathy bioassay (Weiser, Vecchi, & Schlachter, Internat. J. Vit. Nutr. Res. 55:149-158, 1985).
