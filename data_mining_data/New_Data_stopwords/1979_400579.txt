 influence endotoxic administration (0.5 mg/kg) hepatic pyruvate kinase activity normal (nondiabetic) diabetic dogs investigated. Pyruvate kinase activity affected four hours endotoxin injection nondiabetic dogs. However, stimulated 288% dogs made diabetic prior administration endotoxin. Since pyruvate kinase activity diabetic dogs without endotoxin treatment affected, findings suggest stimulatory effect endotoxin pyruvate kinase activity diabetic dogs may associated insulin deficiency and/or high ambient blood glucose level.
