 least three major mammalian isozymes pyruvate kinase (ATP : pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40), designated K4, L4, M4. Whereas parenchymal cells adult rat liver contain type L isozyme, parenchymal cells isolated fetal regenerating liver found synthesize K4 L4 isozymes. small amount K-M hybrid seen regenerating liver, detectable M-L K-L hybrids. Thus, appears type L pyruvate kinase synthesized time liver cell either two isozymes. intermediate electrophoretic bands seen homogenates whole fetal liver, earlier work attributed either hybrid isozymes presence M4, contributed nonparenchymal cells which, fetus, largely hemopoietic. additional bands pyruvate kinase electrophoretically immunologically similar pyruvate kinase isozymes found adult erythrocytes. results reported suggest rigorous control synthesis K4 L4 isozymes parenchymal cells fetal regenerating liver opposed developing neurons glia, shift synthesis type K type subunits appears occur gradually results production substantial amounts hybrid isozymes.
