 epiphyseal growth plate, chondrocyte maturation accompanied dramatic alterations energy metabolism. explore relationship two events, used retinoic acid (RA) promote chondrocyte maturation culture. specific question addressed was, RA treatment cultured chondrocytes vitro induce change energy status similar seen hypertrophic chondrocytes vivo. Maturing chondrocytes isolated cephalic region day 18 chick embryo sterna allowed grow 7-14 days monolayer confluent treated 10-300 nM RA. Immature chondrocytes caudal region sternum grown parallel served control cells study. found maturing cephalic cell cultures, RA rapid profound effect oxidative metabolism. retinoid caused reduction energy charge ratio (ECR) ATP/ADP ratio sharp decrease cell ATP levels. Maximum inhibition observed RA concentration 10-35 nM. Compared adenine nucleotides, creatine phosphate levels decreased lesser extent RA, although substantial inhibition creatine kinase activity. expected find compensatory elevation glycolytic activities; however, lactate levels medium treated cells indicated anaerobic glycolysis depressed. contrast cephalic chondrocytes, caudal cell cultures treated RA, lactate formation stimulated minimal effects oxidative metabolism. determine mechanism inhibition glycolysis, measured activity pyruvate kinase RA-treated cephalic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
