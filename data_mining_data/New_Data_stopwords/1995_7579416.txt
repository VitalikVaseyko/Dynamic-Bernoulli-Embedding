 clarify molecular abnormality pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency identified mutant mice CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc, cloned murine red blood cell-type PK (R-PK) cDNA animals. cDNA sequence spans 1827 bp, including open reading frame encode 574 amino acids. Homology coding sequences murine human R-PK 86.1% nucleotide 91.5% amino acid levels. homozygous missense mutation nucleotide 1013 GGT-->GAT identified cDNA sequence mutant, causing single amino acid substitution no. 338Gly-->Asp murine R-PK. Six amino acid residues, 335Val-336Ala-337Arg-338Gly-339Asp-340L eu, encoded exon 8 human rat L (liver-type)/R-PK genes evolutionarily conserved PK bacteria humans. 337Arg reported important substrate binding, suggesting amino acid change would impair substrate affinity PK subunit. homozygous missense mutation catalytic domain identified human PK variant, PK Hong Kong (941ATT-->ACT, 314 Ile-->Thr). Although 1013A 941C gave rise amino acid change adjacent active site may interfere substrate binding subunit, degree anemia much severe human case. erythroid-progenitor cell number increased spleen Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice level approximately 66 times higher normal CBA mice, suggesting compensatory extramedullary erythropoiesis spleen mutant mice, human variant, might account observed difference phenotype.
