 Sepsis septic shock remain challenging intensive care units worldwide limited treatment options; therefore, identification targetable key players systemic inflammation multiple organ failure urgently needed. Here, show AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) negative regulator bioenergetic reprogramming immune cells suppresses sepsis development vivo. Mechanistically, AMPK deficiency increases pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2)-dependent aerobic glycolysis, leads release high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1, late mediator lethal systemic inflammation) macrophages monocytes. Consequently, activation AMPK A-769662 protects whereas depletion AMPKalpha myeloid cells promotes endotoxic shock polymicrobial sepsis mice. Additionally, administration PKM2 inhibitor shikonin reduces lactate production, HMGB1 release, septic death AMPKalpha-deficient mice. findings suggest disruption AMPK-dependent immunometabolism pathway may contribute sepsis development hence constitute target therapeutic intervention.
