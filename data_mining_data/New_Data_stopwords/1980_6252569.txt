 Alterations enzyme activities glucose metabolism determined distal portion skin flaps guinea pigs elevated following 3, 7, 14, 21 days delay period. Hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities increased delay period, whereas isocitrate malate dehydrogenases exhibited little alteration. Increases glycolytic enzyme activities observed delay procedure diminished flaps elevated initial 3 days delay period, maintained increased flaps elevated 7 21 days. Despite high levels enzyme activities early period delay, flaps elevated period exhibited partial necrosis low glucose level decreased enzyme activities. concluded tissue glucose level utilization crucial factors flap survival.
