 plants, biosynthesis isopentenyl diphosphate, central precursor isoprenoids, proceeds via two separate pathways. cytosolic compartment harbors mevalonate pathway, whereas newly discovered deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate pathway, also operates certain eubacteria, including Escherichia coli, localized plastids. first two steps plastidial pathway, involve condensation pyruvate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate followed intramolecular rearrangement reduction 2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate, established. report cloning peppermint (Mentha x piperita) E. coli, expression, kinase catalyzes phosphorylation isopentenyl monophosphate last step biosynthetic sequence isopentenyl diphosphate. plant gene defines ORF 1,218 bp that, proposed plastidial targeting sequence excluded, corresponds approximately 308 aa mature size approximately 33 kDa. E. coli gene (ychB), located 27.2 min chromosomal map, consists 852 nt, encoding deduced enzyme 283 aa size 31 kDa. enzymes represent conserved class GHMP family kinases, includes galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, homologues plants several eubacteria. Besides preferred substrate isopentenyl monophosphate, recombinant peppermint E. coli kinases also phosphorylate isopentenol, and, much less efficiently, dimethylallyl alcohol, dimethylallyl monophosphate serve substrate. Incubation secretory cells isolated peppermint glandular trichomes isopentenyl monophosphate resulted rapid production monoterpenes sesquiterpenes, confirming isopentenyl monophosphate physiologically relevant, terminal intermediate deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate pathway.
