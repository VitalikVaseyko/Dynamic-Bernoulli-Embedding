 differentiated cells, hepatocytes primarily metabolize glucose ATP production oxidative phosphorylation glycolytic pyruvate, whereas proliferative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells undergo metabolic shift aerobic glycolysis despite oxygen availability. Keratins, intermediate filament (IF) proteins epithelial cells, expressed pairs lineage/differentiation manner. Hepatocyte HCC (hepatoma) cell IFs made solely keratins 8/18 (K8/K18), thus providing models choice address K8/K18 functions normal cancerous epithelial cells. Here, demonstrate distinctive increases glucose uptake, glucose-6-phosphate formation, lactate release, glycogen formation K8/K18 IF-lacking hepatocytes and/or hepatoma cells versus respective IF-containing counterparts. also show K8/K18-dependent glucose uptake/G6P formation linked alterations hexokinase I/II/IV content localization mitochondria, little effect GLUT1 status. addition, find insulin-stimulated glycogen formation normal hepatocytes involves main PI-3 kinase-dependent signaling pathway K8/K18 loss makes efficient glycogen producers. comparison, higher insulin-dependent glycogen formation K8/K18 IF-lacking hepatoma cells associated signaling occurring mTOR-dependent pathway, along augmentation cell proliferative activity. Together, results uncover key K8/K18 regulation glucose metabolism normal cancerous hepatic cells differential modulations mitochondrial HK status insulin-mediated signaling.
