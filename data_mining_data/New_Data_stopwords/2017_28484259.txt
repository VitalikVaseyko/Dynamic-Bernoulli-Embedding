 studies published mechanisms hypoxia response tolerance jellyfish, especially respect regulatory mechanism molecular level. study, Aurelia sp.1, frequently found Chinese coastal waters, cultivated hypoxic system determine molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxic response studying physiological activity, gene expression metabolite contents prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) oxygen-sensing system. Physiological activity; expression PHD, HIF, ALDO (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase), PDK (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) genes; lactic acid content medusae significantly affected hypoxia. up-regulation ALDO, PDK LDH, directly indirectly induced HIF, mediated transition aerobic respiration anaerobic glycolysis medusae. polyps, slight increase expression HIF, PHD ALDO, obvious change PDK slight decrease LDH throughout experiment; however, changes insufficient induce shift. study provides scientific basis elucidating regulatory mechanism underlying PHD-HIF oxygen-sensing system Aurelia sp.1.
