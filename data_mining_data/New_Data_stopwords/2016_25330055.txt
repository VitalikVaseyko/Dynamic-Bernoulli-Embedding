 retina, like many cancers, produces energy glycolysis even presence oxygen. phenomenon known aerobic glycolysis eponymously Warburg effect. recent years, Warburg effect become explosive area study within cancer research community. expanding knowledge molecular mechanisms underpinning Warburg effect cancer promises provide greater understanding mammalian retinal metabolism motivated cancer researchers target Warburg effect novel treatment strategy cancer. However, molecular mechanisms underlying Warburg effect shared retina cancer, treatments targeting Warburg effect may serious adverse effects retinal metabolism. Herein, provide updated understanding Warburg effect mammalian retina.
