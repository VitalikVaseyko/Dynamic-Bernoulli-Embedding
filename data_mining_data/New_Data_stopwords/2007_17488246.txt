 AIM: Regular endurance exercise stimulates muscle metabolic capacity, effects prolonged endurance exercise largely unknown. study examined muscle substrate availability utilization prolonged endurance exercise, associated metabolic genes. METHODS: Data obtained 11 competitors 4- 5-day, almost continuous ultraendurance race (seven males, four females; age: 36 +/- 11 years; cycling Vo(2peak): males 57.4 +/- 5.9, females 48.1 +/- 4.0 mL kg(-1) min(-1)). race muscle biopsies obtained vastus lateralis, respiratory gases sampled cycling 25 50% peak aerobic power output, venous samples obtained, fat mass estimated bioimpedance standardized conditions. RESULTS: race fat mass decreased 1.6 +/- 0.4 kg (11%; P < 0.01). Respiratory exchange ratio 25 50% workloads decreased (P < 0.01) 0.83 +/- 0.06 0.93 +/- 0.03 before, 0.71 +/- 0.01 0.85 +/- 0.02, respectively, race. Plasma fatty acids 3.5 times higher (from 298 +/- 74 1407 +/- 118 micromol L(-1); P < 0.01). Muscle glycogen content fell 50% (from 554 +/- 28 270 +/- 25 nmol kg(-1) d.w.; n = 7, P < 0.01), whereas decline muscle triacylglycerol (from 32 +/- 5 22 +/- 3 mmol kg(-1) d.w.; P = 0.14) statistically significant. race, muscle mRNA content lipoprotein lipase glycogen synthase increased (P < 0.05) 3.9- 1.7-fold, respectively, forkhead homolog rhabdomyosarcoma, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA tended (P < 0.10) higher, whereas muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1beta mRNA tended lower (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: prolonged exercise markedly increases plasma fatty acid availability fat utilization exercise. Exercise-induced regulation genes encoding proteins involved fatty acid recruitment oxidation may contribute changes.
