 BACKGROUND/AIM: Cancer cells consume high amounts glucose produce ATP molecules entering biosynthesis. Numerous experimental studies demonstrated glucose deprivation and/or glycolysis inhibition arrest cancer cell growth may increase efficiency cytotoxic drugs. contrast, increasing glycolysis tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) activates cells destroy cancer cells. propose increase efficiency chemotherapy modulating glucose intake course chemotherapy. MATERIALS METHODS: Glucose caloric intake drastically reduced day chemotherapy administration deprive cancer cells ATP molecules required repair cytotoxic lesions. hours chemotherapy, glucose caloric intake drastically increased days promote activation TILs reinforce destruction cancer cells. RESULTS: strategy could improve results chemotherapy first enhancing cytotoxic stress tumor cells promoting activation anti-cancer immune response. CONCLUSION: modulation glucose intake chemotherapy tested clinically. proposed scheme simple, surely easier follow strict chronic diet, avoid weight loss.
