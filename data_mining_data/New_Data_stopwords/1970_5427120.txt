 Incubation freshly cut carrot tissue Na(3)ADP Na(3)ATP promotes marked intracellular increase ADP ATP. rapid increase ATP ADP incubation ADP ATP incubation results activity cytoplasmic enzyme systems upon nucleotide absorbed cell incubation medium. crossover pyruvate kinase reaction, phosphofructokinase, either ADP ATP added freshly cut tissue. tissue slices washed distilled water, pyruvate kinase exhibits negative crossover first 2 hours positive crossover 2 10 hours cutting. Cutting induces large changes levels nucleotides glycolytic intermediates. immediate depletion compounds upon cutting, nucleotides added system respiration rate limited endogenous nucleotide level. Variation respiratory values fresh cut tissue explained terms range endogenous ADP levels different tissue batches. Nucleotide incubation experiments discussed relation provision ADP rate-limiting pyruvate kinase first phase development induced respiration.
