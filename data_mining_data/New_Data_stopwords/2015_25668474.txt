 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) malignant brain cancer adults, poor prognosis, whose molecular stratification still represents challenge pathology clinics. hand, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations found tumors modifiers bioenergetics state, albeit GBM characterization mtDNA status lacking date. Here, characterization burden mtDNA mutations GBM samples performed. First, investigation tumor-specific vs. non tumor-specific mutations carried MToolBox bioinformatics pipeline analyzing 45 matched tumor/blood samples, whole genome whole exome sequencing datasets obtained Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Additionally, entire mtDNA sequence obtained dataset 104 fresh-frozen GBM samples. Mitochondrial mutations potential pathogenic interest prioritized based heteroplasmic fraction, nucleotide variability, silico prediction pathogenicity. preliminary biochemical analysis activity mitochondrial respiratory complexes also performed fresh-frozen GBM samples. Although high number mutations detected, report large majority pass prioritization filters. Therefore, relatively limited burden pathogenic mutations indeed carried GBM, appear determine general impairment respiratory chain. article part Directed Issue entitled: Energy Metabolism Disorders Therapies.
