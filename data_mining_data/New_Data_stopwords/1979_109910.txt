 patient paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) enzymatic activities erythrocytes leucocytes studied. Studies autohaemolysis also performed. following erythrocytary enzymes measured: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), pyruvate kinase (PK), glutathione reductase (GR), acetylcholinesterase (AcChE). following enzymes measured leucocytes: Adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase adenosine kinase. Normal activity G-6-PD, GR PK erythrocytes found. leucocytes lymphocytes activity purine nucleoside phosphorylase reduced. Auto-haemolysis vitro increased, could compensated addition glucose ATP.
