 Pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle crystallized form suitable high resolution X-ray analysis. Complexes enzyme Mn2+ either pyruvate oxalate crystallize solutions polyethyl-eneglycol 8000 pH 6.0. Crystals obtained solutions complexes pyruvate oxalate appear isomorphous belong triclinic space group P1. crystals unit cell dimensions = 83.3(4) A, b = 109.4(6) A, c = 145.7 (7) A, alpha = 94.9 degrees, beta = 93.6 degrees, gamma = 112.2 degrees. crystals diffract better 2.4 resolution stable X-ray beam least 20 hr. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements single crystal show Mn2+ bound crystalline protein.
