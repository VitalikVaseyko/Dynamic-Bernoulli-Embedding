 MondoA basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/leucine zipper (ZIP) transcription factor expressed predominantly skeletal muscle. Studies vitro suggest Max-like protein X (MondoA:Mlx) heterodimer senses intracellular energy status directly targets promoter region thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) possibly glycolytic enzymes. generated MondoA-inactivated (MondoA-/-) mice gene targeting. MondoA-/- mice normal body weight birth, exhibited normal growth appeared healthy. However, exhibited unique metabolic characteristics. MondoA-/- mice built serum lactate alanine levels utilized fatty acids fuel exercise. Gene expression promoter analysis suggested MondoA functionally represses peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha)-mediated activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK-4) transcription. PDK4 normally down-regulates activity pyruvate dehydrogenase, enzyme complex catalyses decarboxylation pyruvate acetyl-CoA entry Krebs cycle; absence MondoA, pyruvate diverted towards lactate alanine, products glycolysis. Dynamic testing revealed MondoA-/- mice excel sprinting skeletal muscles display enhanced glycolytic capacity. studies uncover hitherto unappreciated function MondoA fuel selection vivo. Lack MondoA results enhanced exercise capacity sprinting.
