 Pyruvate kinase (EC2.7.1.40) Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides purified 40-fold precipitation protamine sulfate ammonium sulfate followed gel-filtration. preparations obtained cells grown different carbon sources cultural conditions differ respect specific activity respect molecular weight (250000 dalton) regulatory properties. phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-saturation cruve enzyme sigmoidal Hill coefficients varying nH equals 1.8 (pH 9.2) 2.7 (pH 6.0). enzyme activated adenosinemonophosphate (AMP) sugarmonophosphates ribose-5-phosphate (R-5-P), glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), and-to lesser extent-fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P). Fructose-1.6-bisphosphate (FDP) measurable effect. Inhibitors enzyme adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), inorganic phosphate (Pi) dicarboxylic acids succinate fumarate. Kinetic analysis reveals sugar-phosphates dicarboxylic acids act true allosteric ligands, whereas effects AMP, ATP, Pi cannot interpreted soley terms allosteric interactions. Cold-treatment enzymes lead rapid loss activity, change regulatory properties enzyme. Analysis kinetics cold-inactivation reversal 30 percent C, together studies gelfiltration behaviour native cold-treated enzyme make likely cold-induced loss activity due dissociation enzyme.
