 kinetics regulation mitochondrial respiration endogenous exogenous ADP muscle cells situ studied skinned cardiac skeletal muscle fibres. Endogenous ADP production initiated addition MgATP; conditions respiration rate ADP concentration medium dependent calcium concentration, 70-80% maximal rate respiration achieved ADP concentration 20 microM medium. contrast, exogenous ADP added, maximal respiration rate observed millimolar concentrations. exogenous ADP-consuming system consisting pyruvate kinase (PK; 20-40 units/ml) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP; 5 mM), totally suppressed respiration activated exogenous ADP, respiration maintained endogenous ADP suppressed 20-40%. Creatine (20 mM) activated respiration presence ATP PK+PEP. Short treatment trypsin (50-500 nM 5 min) decreased apparent K(m) exogenous ADP 300-350 microM 50-60 microM, increased inhibition respiration PK+PEP system 70-80%, changes MgATPase activity maximal respiration rates. Electron-microscopic observations showed detachment mitochondria disordering regular structure sarcomere trypsin treatment. Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed group least seven low-molecular-mass proteins cardiac skinned fibres sensitive trypsin present glycolytic fibres, low apparent K(m) exogenous ADP. concluded that, oxidative muscle cells, mitochondria incorporated functional complexes ('intracellular energetic units') adjacent ADP-producing systems myofibrils sarcoplasmic reticulum, probably due specific interaction cytoskeletal elements responsible mitochondrial distribution cell. suggested complexes represent basic pattern organization muscle-cell energy metabolism.
