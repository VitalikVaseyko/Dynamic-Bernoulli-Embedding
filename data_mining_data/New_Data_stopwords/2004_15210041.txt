 Various isoforms glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase expressed different cell types. One isoforms, Tu M2-PK, over-expressed tumor cells released body fluids. Plasma determination Tu M2-PK shown discriminate benign malignant lesions. Tu M2-PK quantitated plasma 50 patients cervical carcinoma, 10 patients chronic cervicitis 10 healthy controls. concentration Tu M2-PK determined commercial kits using sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay based two monoclonal antibodies (clone II) specific Tu M2-PK. sensitivity test discrimination malignant non-malignant condition 82% specificity 60%. Highly significant statistical difference found means three groups (P = 0.0002). present results indicate Tu M2-PK used tumor marker follow-up patients cervical carcinoma.
