 BACKGROUND: Hyperlactatemia metabolic complication hypermetabolic, hyperdynamic sepsis. important mechanism responsible elevating plasma lactate concentrations sepsis altered regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) skeletal muscle. investigated ability specific tumor necrosis factor binding protein, TNFbp, modulate lactate concentrations skeletal muscle PDH activity rodent model chronic abdominal sepsis. MATERIALS METHODS: examined regulation lactate metabolism four groups animals: Control, Control + TNFbp, Septic, Septic + TNFbp. Chronic (5 days) sepsis induced creation stable intraabdominal abscess using sterile fecal-agar pellet inoculated E. coli plus B. Fragilis foreign body nidus. TNFbp (1 mg/kg/day) injected subcutaneously daily. RESULTS: Sepsis increased plasma skeletal muscle lactate concentrations 2-fold compared control. septic rats treated TNFbp, plasma skeletal muscle lactate concentrations significantly decreased compared untreated septic rats. skeletal muscle, sepsis resulted 70% decrease proportion PDH active form compared controls. sepsis-induced inhibition PDH complex activity prevented TNFbp. PDH kinase enhanced 1.8-fold sepsis, increase PDH kinase activity prevented treatment TNFbp. TNFbp treatment effects plasma lactate proportion active skeletal muscle PDH activity control animals. CONCLUSIONS: TNFbp prevents sepsis-induced hyperlactatemia derangements skeletal muscle lactate concentrations PDH activity. observations suggest TNF important mediator responsible lactate dyshomeostasis sepsis.
