 5 blood samples newborns, whose reticulocytes enriched density gradient centrifugation, 25 blood samples different reticulocytoses man determined: extent intra- extramitochondrial respiration, coupling electron transfer oxidative phosphorylation electronmicroscopic appearance, number mitochondria. reticulocytes occurring flowing human blood general relatively stiff characterized following properties:--low respiration--low capacity respiratory chain enzymes--weakened Pasteur effect --varying proportion intramitochondrial respiration total respiration--decoupling major part intramitochondrial respiration--low number mitochondria--qualitative changes mitochondria. However, situations erythropoiesis immature reticulocytes discharged man (similar socalled "stress reticulocytes" rabbits). hand, could shown reticulocytes rabbits mature normal state.
