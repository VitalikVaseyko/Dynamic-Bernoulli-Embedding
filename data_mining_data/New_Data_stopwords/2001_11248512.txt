 enzymatic method proposed determination acetylcarnitine (AcCar), even carnitine (Car), non-acetylated form, co-exists. method consisted four enzymatic reactions: First, AcCar hydrolysed acylcarnitine hydrolase yield acetate; followed three reactions coupled three enzymes, respectively, acetate kinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase; finally, acetate formation causes decrease NADH. amount AcCar evaluated change absorbance 340 nm. reagent composition reaction mixture determined, characteristics method investigated. dilution test showed good linearity wide range. precision accuracy tests produced satisfactory results. co-existence Car gave effect measurement. present method found used easily, simply rapidly selective determination AcCar.
