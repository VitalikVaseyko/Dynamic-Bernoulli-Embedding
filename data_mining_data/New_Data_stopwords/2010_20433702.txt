 BACKGROUND: previous study, well defined IGFBP7 important tumor suppressor gene colorectal cancer (CRC). aimed uncover downstream molecules responsible IGFBP7's behaviour study. METHODS: Differentially expressed protein profiles PcDNA3.1(IGFBP7)-transfected RKO cells empty vector transfected controls generated two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) mass spectrometry (MS) identification. selected differentially expressed protein induced IGFBP7 confirmed western blot ELISA. biological behaviour protein explored cell growth assay colony formation assay. RESULTS: Six unique proteins found differentially expressed PcDNA3.1(IGFBP7)-transfected RKO cells, including albumin (ALB), 60 kDa heat shock protein(HSP60), Actin cytoplasmic 1 2, pyruvate kinase muscle 2(PKM2), beta subunit phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase(FARSB) hypothetical protein. downregulation HSP60 IGFBP7 confirmed western blot ELISA. Recombinant human HSP60 protein could increase proliferation rate colony formation ability PcDNA3.1(IGFBP7)-RKO cells. CONCLUSION: HSP60 important downstream molecule IGFBP7. downregulation HSP60 induced IGFBP7 may be, least part, responsible IGFBP7's tumor suppressive biological behaviour CRC.
