 Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells acquire resistance chemotherapy apoptosis, part, due enhanced aerobic glycolysis biomass production, known Warburg effect. previously demonstrated combination simvastatin (SIM) metformin (MET) ameliorates critical Warburg effect-related metabolic aberrations C4-2B cells, synergistically significantly decreases CRPC cell viability metastatic properties, minimal effect normal prostate epithelial cells, inhibits primary prostate tumor growth, metastasis, biochemical failure orthotopic model metastatic CRPC, effectively docetaxel chemotherapy. Several modes cell death activated individual treatment SIM MET reported; however, cell death process induced combination SIM MET treatment metastatic CRPC cells remains unknown. must determined prior advancing combination SIM MET clinical trial metastatic CRPC. Treatment C4-2B cells combination 4 muM SIM 2 mM MET (SIM+MET) led significant G1-phase cell cycle arrest decrease percentage DNA-replicating cells S-phase 24 h; arrest sustained throughout 96-h treatment. SIM+MET treatment led enhanced autophagic flux C4-2B cells 72-96 h, ascertained increased LC3B-II (further enhanced lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine) reduced Sequestosome-1 protein expression, significantly increased percentage acidic vesicular organelle-positive cells, increased autophagic structure accumulation assessed transmission electron microscopy. Chloroquine, however, could rescue CRPC cell viability, eliminating autophagic cell death; rather, autophagy upregulated C4-2B cells attempt withstand chemotherapy. Instead, SIM+MET treatment led Ripk1- Ripk3-dependent necrosis 48-96 h, determined propidium iodide-Annexin V flow cytometry, increase Ripk1 Ripk3 protein expression, necrosome formation, HMGB-1 extracellular release, necrotic induction viability rescue necrostatin-1 Ripk3-targeting siRNA. necrosis-inducing capacity SIM+MET may make drugs highly-effective treatment apoptosis- chemotherapy-resistant metastatic CRPC cells.
