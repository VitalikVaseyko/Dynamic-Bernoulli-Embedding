 Wing-polymorphic insects excellent models asking questions trade-offs physiology life-history existence multiple morphs exhibiting numerous strategies living one environment. measured activities select key enzymes oxidative metabolism (citrate synthase), glycolysis (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase) fatty acid oxidation (ss-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HOAD) flying non-flying long-winged bugs two populations (ancestral derived) wing-polymorphic soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma). ancestral population, flyers significantly greater activities citrate synthase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, HOAD non-flyers. contrast, derived population, flyers non-flyers showed significant differences activities enzymes tested. significant differences activities citrate synthase function adult age (3-20 d) either population. Short-winged bugs derived population significantly lower citrate synthase activities either two derived, long-winged morphs, however, analogous ancestral long-winged non-flyer. results suggest evolution alternative flight strategies two populations.
