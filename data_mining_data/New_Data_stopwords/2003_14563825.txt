 Type 2 diabetes related decrease mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content. study, show increased expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) target genes involved fatty acid metabolism skeletal muscle Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) (fa/fa) rats. contrast, mRNA levels genes involved glucose transport utilization (GLUT4 phosphofructokinase) decreased, whereas expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK-4), suppresses glucose oxidation, increased. shift glucose fatty acids source energy skeletal muscle ZDF rats accompanied reduction subunit 1 complex (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, ND1) subunit II complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase II, COII), two genes electronic transport chain encoded mtDNA. transcript levels PPARgamma Coactivator 1 (PGC-1) showed significant reduction. Treatment troglitazone (30 mg/kg/day) 15 days reduced insulin values reversed increase PDK-4 mRNA levels, suggesting improved insulin sensitivity. addition, troglitazone treatment restored ND1 PGC-1 expression skeletal muscle. results suggest troglitazone may avoid mitochondrial metabolic derangement development diabetes mellitus 2 skeletal muscle.
