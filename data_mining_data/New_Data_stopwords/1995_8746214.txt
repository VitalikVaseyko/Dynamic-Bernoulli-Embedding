 OBJECTIVES: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) potent vasoconstrictor expressed endothelial cells many cells tissues. Increased plasma levels peptide associated ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction. objectives current study (1) determine tissue specificity induction ET-1 gene hypoxia, (2) determine whether hypoxia regulatory pathway hypoxia regulated genes (3) analyze contributions protein kinases basal induced expression ET-1. METHODS: ET-1 transcript levels measured Northern blot quantitative polymerase chain reaction endothelial non-endothelial cells following exposure hypoxia. Regulatory steps within pathway identified treating aerobic hypoxic cultures cycloheximide, PMA, series selective protein kinase inhibitors, transition metals. effects ET-1 transcripts compared ubiquitous hypoxia inducible pyruvate kinase gene. RESULTS: induction ET-1 hypoxia vitro occurred exclusively early passage endothelial cells. induction prevented treatment protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide least partially mimicked treatment transition metals. Induction hypoxia effected inhibitors protein kinase C, protein kinase A, calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase, cyclic GMP dependent protein kinase. basal expression decreased hypoxic induction eliminated treating cells tyrosine kinase-selective inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Et-1 induction hypoxia requires endothelial cell-specific factor(s) steps, new protein synthesis, may involve haeme protein-containing pathway oxygen sensing. protein tyrosine kinase step implicated basal induced expression ET-1 gene.
