 Regulation vitro phosphorylation process photosynthetic form (G form) Sorghum leaf Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC: EC 4.1.1.31) studied. Results established that: 1) PEPC efficiently phosphorylated seryl residues crude leaf extract 2) Pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (EC 2.7.9.1.) supposed interfere process, found significantly phosphorylated experimental conditions 3) KF, well Ca++ Mg++ ions increased radioactive signal detected 4) addition EDTA EGTA nullified Ca++ alone found reverse inhibitory effect exerted chelators 5) addition anti-Calmodulin antibodies medium also abolished PEPC phosphorylation. Present data demonstrated post-translational modification C4-plant photosynthetic PEPC Ca++/Calmodulin dependent process.
