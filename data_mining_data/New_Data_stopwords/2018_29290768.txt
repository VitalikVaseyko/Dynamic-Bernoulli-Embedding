 Background: Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT), non-invasive intervention using 13.56 MHz radiofrequency, selectively target cancers due elevated glycolysis (Warburg-effect), extracellular ion concentration conductivity compared normal tissues. showed earlier mEHT alone provoke apoptosis damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signals human HT29 colorectal cancer xenografts immunocompromised mice. Materials: tested mEHT induced stress immune responses C26 colorectal cancer allografts immunocompetent (BALB/c) mice 12-72 h post-treatment. right side symmetrical tumors grown femoral regions mice treated 30 minutes, left side tumors served untreated controls. Results: Loco-regional mEHT treatment induced ongoing significant tumor damage blockade cell cycle progression indicated loss nuclear Ki67 protein. Nuclear shrinkage, apoptotic bodies DNA fragmentation detected using TUNEL assay confirmed apoptosis. Cleaved/activated-caspase-8 -caspase-3 upregulation along mitochondrial translocation bax protein release cytochrome-c consistent activation extrinsic intrinsic caspase-dependent programmed cell death pathways. prominent release stress-associated Hsp70, calreticulin HMGB1 proteins, relevant DAMP signaling, accompanied significant tumor infiltration S100 positive antigen presenting dendritic cells CD3 positive T-cells scant FoxP3 positive regulatory T-cells. addition, mEHT combined chlorogenic acid rich T-cell promoting agent induced significant cell death treated untreated contralateral tumors indicating systemic anti-tumor effect. Conclusions: mEHT induced caspase-dependent programmed cell death release stress associated DAMP proteins colorectal cancer allografts provoke major immune cell infiltration. Accumulating antigen presenting dendritic cells T-cells likely contribute ongoing tumor destruction immunogenic cell death mechanism locally systemic effect distant tumor sites.
