 Isozyme patterns 23 different enzymes compared normal, benign, malignant breast tissues; MCF-7 cells; organoids normal human breast tissue. Benign lesions generally showed isozyme patterns similar normal tissues. Lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 5 significantly increased malignant tumors; MCF-7 cells lactate dehydrogenase (L-lactate:NAD oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.27). mitochondrial form malate dehydrogenase also significantly increased human malignant tumors; especially evident comparing tumor apparently uninvolved breast tissue patient. K4 isozyme pyruvate kinase major form malignant breast tumors, 41% normal tissues, 30% fibrocystic disease specimens, 46% fibroadenomas. anodal band pyruvate kinase, probably K3M K3Kpm hybrid, predominated normal benign tissues, 63% primary 56% secondary tumors. specimens predominantly creatine kinase BB, aldolase A4, hexokinase I. Traces aldolase A3C hexokinase II observed tumors. None tumors Regan variant alkaline phosphatase. isozymes lactate malate dehydrogenases pyruvate kinase appear promising putative tumor markers.
