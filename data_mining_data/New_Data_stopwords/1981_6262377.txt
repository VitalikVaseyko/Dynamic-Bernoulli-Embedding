 Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity human skin fibroblasts appears regulated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism, case animal cells. enzyme activated pretreating cells dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, disrupted measurement PDC activity. treatment, activity reaches 5-6 nmol/min per mg protein 37 degrees C fibroblasts infants. values represent activation 5-20-fold observed untreated cells. assay, based [1-(14)C]pyruvate decarboxylation, represents valid measurement overall PDC reaction shown dependence (14)CO(2) production presence thiamin-PP, coenzyme (CoA), Mg(++), NAD(+). Also, shown acetyl-CoA (14)CO(2) formed 1:1 ratio. similar degree activation PDC also achieved adding purified pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase high concentrations Mg(++) Ca(++), cases adding metal ions alone cell homogenate disruption. results strongly suggest activation due dephosphorylation. Addition NaF, inhibits dephosphorylation, leads almost complete loss PDC activity. Assays completely activated PDC performed two cell lines originating patients reported deficient enzyme (Blass, J. P., J. Avigan, B. W. Ublendorf. 1970. J. Clin. Invest. 49: 423-432; Blass, J. P., J. D. Schuman, D. S. Young, E. Ham. 1972. J. Clin. Invest. 51: 1545-1551). Even activation DCA, fibroblasts patients showed values 0.1 0.3 nmol/min per mg protein. familial study one patients showed parents exhibited activity fully activated cells half normal values, whereas cells sibling appeared normal. results demonstrate inheritance nature PDC deficiency, present assay sufficient detect heterozygous carriers deficiency. Application procedures fibroblasts obtained 16 individuals believed normal PDC activities showed range 2-2.5 nmol/min per mg protein adults 5-6 nmol/min per mg protein cells infants.
