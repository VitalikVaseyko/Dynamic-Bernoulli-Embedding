 Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), active principle croton oil, potent platelet aggregating agent. Previous cytochemical electron microscopic studies demonstrated PMA caused selective labilization platelet storage granules resulting conversion distended vacuoles. Communication established enlarged, almost empty vacuoles surrounding plasma channels open canalicular system. present study explored possibility effect PMA platelet storage organelles stimulates process secretion. Analysis release reaction platelets exposure PMA revealed significant amounts serotonin adenine nucleotides secreted without loss lactic dehydrogenase. Release took place well onset irreversible aggregation. Inhibitors platelet secretion ADP induced aggregation could modify prevent irreversible clumping stimulated small concentrations PMA. Although secretion induced PMA differed release caused agents, findings present study indicate PMA capable triggering platelet release reaction.
