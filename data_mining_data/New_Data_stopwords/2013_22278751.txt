 addition cancer imaging, (13) C-MRS hyperpolarized pyruvate also demonstrated utility investigation cardiac metabolism ischemic heart disease. Although adverse effects yet reported doses commonly used vivo, high substrate concentrations lead supraphysiological pyruvate levels affect underlying metabolism considered interpreting results. lactate serving important energy source heart physiological lactate levels one two orders magnitude higher pyruvate, hyperpolarized lactate could potentially used alternative pyruvate probing cardiac metabolism. study, hyperpolarized [1-(13) C]lactate used acquire time-resolved spectra healthy rat heart vivo measure dichloroacetate (DCA)-modulated changes flux pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). primary oxidation lactate pyruvate subsequent conversion pyruvate alanine bicarbonate could reliably detected. Since DCA stimulates activity PDH inhibition PDH kinase, 2.5-fold increase bicarbonate-to-substrate ratio found administration DCA, similar effect using [1-(13) C]pyruvate substrate.
