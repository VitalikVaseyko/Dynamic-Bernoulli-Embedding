 Activity mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation three specific serine residues (site 1, Ser-264; site 2, Ser-271; site 3, Ser-203) alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. Phosphorylation carried four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoenzymes. Specificity four mammalian PDKs toward three phosphorylation sites E1 investigated using recombinant E1 mutant proteins one functional phosphorylation site present. four PDKs phosphorylated site 1 site 2, however, different rates phosphate buffer (for site 1, PDK2 > PDK4 approximately PDK1 > PDK3; site 2, PDK3 > PDK4 > PDK2 > PDK1). Site 3 phosphorylated PDK1 only. maximum activation dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase demonstrated PDK3. free form, PDKs phosphorylated site 1, PDK4 highest activity toward site 2. activity four PDKs stimulated different extent reduction acetylation state lipoyl moieties dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase maximum stimulation PDK2. Substitution site 1 serine glutamate, mimics phosphorylation-dependent inactivation E1, affect phosphorylation site 2 four PDKs site 3 PDK1. Site specificity phosphorylation four PDKs unique tissue distribution could contribute tissue-specific regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex normal pathophysiological states.
