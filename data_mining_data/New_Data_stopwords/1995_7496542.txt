 Aspergillus nidulans wild-type extreme carbon catabolite derepressed mutant creAd-30 characterized respect enzyme activities, metabolite concentrations polyol pools related glycolysis, growth D-glucose. creAd-30 strain enzymes hexokinase fructose-6-phosphate reductase showed two- threefold increase activity, respectively, whereas phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activity decreased two- threefold, respectively, comparison wild-type strain. notable changes metabolite concentrations fructose 2,6-bisphosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate showed 2.5-fold increase, whereas pyruvate citrate decreased creAd-30. Striking differences found polyol concentrations measured two strains tested. Intracellular glycerol arabitol concentrations 10-fold higher erythritol fivefold higher creAd-30, whereas intracellular trehalose mannitol decreased. total internal polyol concentration appears constant approximately 700 mumol (g dry wt)-1. polyols also detected high amounts culture filtrate creAd-30 mutant strain extracellular trehalose found. overall production polyols strain therefore much higher wild-type. high level polyols produced changes metabolite concentrations creAd-30 strain suggest differences enzyme activities result altered flow glycolysis leading rapid formation polyols subsequently secreted.
