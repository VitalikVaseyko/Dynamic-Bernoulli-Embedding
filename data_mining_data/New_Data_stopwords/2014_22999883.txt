 PIF-pocket AGC protein kinases participates physiologic mechanism regulation acting docking site substrates switch transduction conformational changes needed activation inhibition. describe effects compounds bind PIF-pocket PDK1. vitro, PS210 potent activator PDK1, crystal structure PDK1-ATP-PS210 complex shows PS210 stimulates closure kinase domain. However, cells, prodrug PS210 (PS423) acts substrate-selective inhibitor PDK1, inhibiting phosphorylation activation S6K, requires docking PIF-pocket, affecting PKB/Akt. work describes tool study dynamics PDK1 activity potential approach drug discovery.
