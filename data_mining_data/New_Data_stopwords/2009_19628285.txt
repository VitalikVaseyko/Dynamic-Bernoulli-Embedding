 Autoimmunity associated streptococcal infection proposed pathogenic mechanism obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) children. Antibrain antibody profiles compared children OCD-only (n = 13; 14.1 +/- 3.1 years), OCD+PANDAS (n = 20; 11.3 +/- 1.5 years), OCD+Chronic Tic Disorder (n = 23; 13.4 +/- 3.5 years), controls (n = 29; 12.4 +/- 2.4 years) using ELISA (orbitofrontal (OFC) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate (CD), cingulate gyrus (CG)), immunoblotting (four regions plus putative antigens), immunohistochemistry. ELISA immunohistochemistry showed differences among groups. Immunoblot showed greater percentage individuals OCD+PANDAS cohort reactive bands 27 kDa (CD, CG, DLPFC), 36 kDa (CD), 100 kDa (CD, OFC) increased peak height 67 kDa (all regions). Immunoblotting studies using putative antigens (pyruvate kinase M1, aldolase C, alpha- gamma-enolase) differ among groups. ASO titers similar groups correlate immunoassays. remains controversial whether childhood OCD associated autoimmune mechanisms.
