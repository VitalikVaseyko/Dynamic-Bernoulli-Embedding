 case polymyositis associated chronic active hepatitis reported. 53-year-old man, previous history blood transfusion hepatitis, noticed proximal dominant muscle weakness January 29, 1985. admitted Kyoto National Hospital February 7, laboratory studies disclosed elevation serum enzyme levels; creatine kinase (CK) 9845 IU/L (normal 54-263), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) 834 IU/L (9-31), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) 491 IU/L (4-34), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 2135 IU/L (248-464). Also serum gamma globulin high (1.8 g/dl) LE-like cell found. diagnosis polymyositis made prednisolone therapy (60 mg/day) started February 23. elevated serum enzymes decreased gradually, severe muscle weakness persisted one month. April 3, admitted hospital. Physical examination revealed moderate proximal dominant muscle weakness without skin eruption, jaundice hepatosplenomegaly. serum enzymes still high; CK 1826, GOT 173, GPT 232 (GOT less GPT), LDH 1548. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) bilirubin normal. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) detected. Antinuclear antibody positive. electromyogram study showed myopathic change, muscle biopsy demonstrated myopathic change cell infiltration, compatible polymyositis. results suggested liver dysfunction associated polymyositis. Prednisolone therapy continued muscle weakness decreased. December, 1985, serum enzymes (CK, GOT, GPT, LDH) elevated muscle weakness also slightly increased. Anti-smooth muscle antibody positive. suggested polymyositis liver dysfunction deteriorated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
