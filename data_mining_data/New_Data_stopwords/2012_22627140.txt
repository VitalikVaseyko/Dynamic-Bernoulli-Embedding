 PKM2 isoenzyme glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase promotes aerobic glycolysis. Here, describe important role PKM2 regulating survival gastric cancer (GC) cells. showed PKM2 overexpressed gastric tumor tissues compared normal tissues expression level associated poor survival gastric cancer patients. also showed PKM2 affected cell survival regulating Bcl-xL transcriptional level. PKM2 knockdown partially affected stability NF-kB subunit p65, suggesting post-translational regulation p65 PKM2 one plausible mechanisms increased cell growth. Therefore, PKM2 may function upstream molecule regulates p65 function thus enhances growth tumor cells.
