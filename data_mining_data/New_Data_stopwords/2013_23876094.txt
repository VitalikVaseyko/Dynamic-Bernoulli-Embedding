 INTRODUCTION: Cisplatin highly effective antineoplastic drug extremely current mechanism action. Cisplatin-induced side effects dose-dependent limit administration increased dosages, thus compromising therapeutic efficacy. AREAS COVERED: review aims describe emerging knowledge biochemical mechanisms mediate cisplatin cytotoxicity side effects. specific section devoted discuss pathogenesis cisplatin-related toxicities potential measures counteract them. EXPERT OPINION: Although cisplatin used long time, recently exact mechanism action better defined. cytotoxic activity cisplatin largely dependent glycolytic metabolism tumor cells: cisplatin redirects cancer cells oxidative phosphorylation 'Warburg effect', considered one important mechanisms tumor cell survival. interference cisplatin glucose metabolism also cause relevant toxicities. emerging knowledge complex mechanisms, mediate cisplatin cytotoxicity side effect, may lead appropriate safe use drug. studies warranted define implement effectiveness combination targeted drugs able interfere cellular energy metabolism, mTOR inhibitors.
