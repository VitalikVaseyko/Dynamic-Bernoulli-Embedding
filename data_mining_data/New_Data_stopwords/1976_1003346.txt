 occurrence levels activity various enzymes carbohydrate catabolism culture forms (promastigotes) 4 human species Leishmania (L. brasiliensis, L. donovani, L. mexicana, L. tropica) compared. organisms possess enzymes Embden-Meyerhof pathway lack lactate dehydrogenase. evidence could found production lactic acid growing cultures lactic acid could detected either cell-free preparations incubation cell-free extracts pyruvate NADH appropriate conditions. 4 species possess alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase alpha-glycerophosphate phosphatase together could regenerate NAD, thus compensating absence lactate dehydrogenase. oxidative nonoxidative reactions hexose monophosphate pathway present 4 species. Cell-free extracts pyruvate dehydrogenase activity allows entry pyruvate subsequent oxidation tricarboxylic acid cycle. enzymes cycle, including thiamine pyrophosphate dependent alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, present. NAD NADP-linked malate dehydrogenase activities present. isocitrate dehydrogenase NADP specific. active glutamate dehydrogenase could compete alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase common substrate (alpha-ketoglutarate). Replenishment C4 acids accomplished heterotrophic CO2 fixation catalyzed pyruvate carboxylase. 4 species high levels NADH oxidase activity. Several enzymes thus far found species Leishmania demonstrated. are: phosphoglucose isomerase, triose phosphate isomerase, fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate phosphatase, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, citrate synthase, aconitase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, NADH oxidase.
