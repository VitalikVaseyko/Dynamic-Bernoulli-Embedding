 differences conformation solution fluorosulfonylbenzoyl nucleosides analyzed fluorescence proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. quantum yield 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-1,N6-ethenoadenosine (5'-FSB epsilon A) aqueous solution low (o = 0.01) compared parent nucleoside, ethenoadenosine (o = 0.54), increases approximately 5-fold measured series solvents decreasing dielectric constant. quantum yield 5'-p-sulfonylbenzoyl-1,N6-ethenoadenosine covalently bound glutamate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase also 0.01, suggesting analogue may exist conformation enzyme-bound free solution. D2O, resonances purine ring protons 5'-FSB epsilon A, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (5'-FSBA), 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl guanosine (5'-FSBG) shifted upfield 0.1-0.3 ppm relative corresponding protons parent nucleosides. calculated difference chemical shift (delta delta) decreases dielectric constant solvent decreases. delta delta decreases increasing temperature. data indicate 5'-FSB epsilon A, 5'-FSBA, 5'-FSBG exist aqueous solution conformation purine ring intramolecularly stacked benzoyl moiety. magnitude change delta delta 5'-FSB epsilon A, 5'-FSBA, 5'-FSBG function solvent, appears three analogues differ sensitivity disruption stacking. solution conformation three fluorosulfonylbenzoyl nucleoside analogues may important determinant reaction various enzymes may explain differences among analogues reaction single enzyme.
