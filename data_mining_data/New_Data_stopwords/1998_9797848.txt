 OBJECTIVE: Antioxidant enzymes important part defence mechanisms free radical damage. Little known, however, relationship sex steroid hormones cellular antioxidant systems. investigated effect physiological sex steroid changes erythrocyte antioxidant glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity menstrual cycle population healthy normomenorrhoic women. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled. PATIENTS: Ten normally cycling women (age range: 19-28 years; mean: 23.3 years) recruited alternate-day blood sampling first day one menstrual bleed first day subsequent menstrual phase. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma analysed LH, FSH, oestradiol (E2) progesterone (P4) concentrations. Erythrocyte GSH-Px activity evaluated days subjects. Pyruvate-kinase (PK) activity, index red blood cell population age, also determined. RESULTS: women examined normal ovulatory cycle, indicated hormone plasma pattern. Cycle length standardized basis preovulatory E2 peak. Significant cycle phase-related changes GSH-Px (P < 0.03) observed, higher GSH-Px activity levels found later follicular early luteal phase compared early follicular phase (chi 2 = 8.53, P < 0.001 chi 2 = 5.54, P < 0.002, respectively). significant positive correlation observed mean E2 GSH-Px cycle-related changes (r = 0.78, P = 0.001). Conversely, significant cycle phase-dependent variations detected PK. CONCLUSIONS: findings support hypothesis physiological ovarian E2 production menstrual cycle may play important role regulating erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity.
