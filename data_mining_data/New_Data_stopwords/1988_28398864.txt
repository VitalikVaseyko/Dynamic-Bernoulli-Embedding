 Muscle pyruvate kinase (PYK) activity established biochemical indicator temperature attained cooking model system commercial-type pullman-style canned cured pork product. Water extract (model system) pressed-out meat juice (commercial-type pullman-style canned cured pork) incubated (37 degrees C 40 min) reagent containing adenosine diphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvic acid NADH. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) necessary reaction provided muscle extract meat juice. muscle PYK activity present, NADH oxidized resulting loss fluorescence (reaction mixture spots filter paper viewed long-wave ultraviolet light). Model system results showed high PYK activity (no fluorescence) remained samples heated 67.7 degrees C. PYK activity progressively declined samples heated 68.3 degrees C 68.9 degrees C. PYK activity detected samples heated 69.5 degrees C 70 degrees C. Canned product attaining core temperature 62.9 degrees C high PYK activity. PYK activity progressively declined product heated 65.6 degrees C 68.6 degrees C. Essentially PYK activity detected product processed 69.9 degrees C.
