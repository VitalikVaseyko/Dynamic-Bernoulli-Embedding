 Vertebrate photoreceptors among metabolically active cells, exhibiting high rate ATP consumption. coupled high anabolic demand, necessitated diurnal turnover specialized membrane-rich organelle, outer segment, primary site phototransduction. photoreceptors balance catabolic anabolic demands poorly understood. Here, show rod photoreceptors mice rely glycolysis outer segment biogenesis. Genetic perturbations targeting allostery key regulatory nodes glycolytic pathway impacted size outer segments. Fibroblast growth factor signaling found regulate glycolysis, antagonism pathway resulting anabolic deficits. data demonstrate cell autonomous role glycolytic pathway outer segment maintenance provide evidence aerobic glycolysis part metabolic program supports biosynthetic needs normal neuronal cell type.
