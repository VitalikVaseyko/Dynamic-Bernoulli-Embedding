 Flooding injury major problem soybean cultivation. proteomics approach used clarify occurrence changes protein expression level phosphorylation soybeans flooding stress. Two-day-old seedlings flooded 1 day, proteins extracted root tips seedlings digested trypsin, expression levels phosphorylation states compared untreated controls using mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques. Phosphoproteins enriched using phosphoprotein purification column prior digestion mass spectrometry. expression proteins involved energy production increased result flooding, expression proteins involved protein folding cell structure maintenance decreased. Flooding induced changes phosphorylation status proteins involved energy generation, protein synthesis cell structure maintenance. response flooding stress may regulated modulation protein expression phosphorylation state. Energy-demanding production-related metabolic pathways may particularly subject regulation changes protein phosphorylation flooding.
