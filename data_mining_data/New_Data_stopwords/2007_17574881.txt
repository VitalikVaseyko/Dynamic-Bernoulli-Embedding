 common cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia pyruvate kinase deficiency, associated lifelong chronic hemolysis. Pyruvate kinase deficiency worldwide distribution higher prevalence Caucasian population, especially Europe North America. inherited autosomal fashion 180 different mutations described. Investigation hemolytic anemia Northern Ireland uncovered 4 new cases pyruvate kinase deficiency. Molecular investigation revealed total six different mutations. One mutation (p.Arg495Val) reported first time homozygous patient. Another mutant PKLR allele harbored nonsense frameshift mutation cis: c.[721G>T; 826delG]. Considering three previously described Irish cases pyruvate kinase deficiency, study raises total number pyruvate kinase-deficient Irish patients seven total nine mutant PKLR alleles identified. indicates absence founder pyruvate kinase mutation Northern Ireland population. Although pyruvate kinase deficiency prevalent Caucasian population reflected number individuals diagnosed Northern Ireland. Hence, many cases pyruvate kinase deficiency may remain undetected possibly due resultant anemia mild.
