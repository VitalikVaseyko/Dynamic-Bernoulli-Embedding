 molecular mechanism Salinomycin's toxicity fully understood. Various studies reported Ca(2+), cytochrome c, caspase activation play role Salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Salinomycin may target Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway promote differentiation thus elimination cancer stem cells. study, show massive autophagic response Salinomycin (substantially stronger commonly used autophagic inducer Rapamycin) prostrate-, breast cancer cells, lesser degree human normal dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, autophagy induced Salinomycin cell protective mechanism tested cancer cell lines. Furthermore, Salinomycin induces mitophagy, mitoptosis increased mitochondrial membrane potential (Psi) subpopulation cells. Salinomycin strongly, time-dependent manner decreases cellular ATP level. Contrastingly, human normal dermal fibroblasts treated Salinomycin show initial decrease mitochondrial mass, however largely resistant Salinomycin-triggered ATP-depletion. data provide new insight molecular mechanism preferential toxicity Salinomycin towards cancer cells, suggest possible clinical application Salinomycin combination autophagy inhibitors (i.e. clinically-used Chloroquine). Furthermore, discuss preferential Salinomycins toxicity context Warburg effect.
