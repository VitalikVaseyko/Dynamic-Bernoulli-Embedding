 investigate genomic effects, human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells exposed three days two different forms nanoparticles composed CeO2 (0.3, 3 30 mug/mL). two CeO2 nanoparticles dry primary particle sizes 8 nanometers {(M) made NanoAmor} 58 nanometers {(L) made Alfa Aesar} differ various physical-chemical properties well. smaller particle stronger antioxidant properties, probably higher Ce3+ levels particle surface, well surface area per unit weight. Nanoparticle showed normal dose-response pattern 363, 633 1273 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 0.3, 3 30 mug/mL, respectively. contrast, nanoparticle L showed puzzling dose-response pattern DEGs found lowest exposure group 1049, 303 323 DEGs 0.3, 3 30 mug/mL, respectively. systems biological genomic study showed major altered pathways two nano cerium oxides protein synthesis, stress response, proliferation/cell cycle, cytoskeleton remodeling/actin polymerization cellular metabolism. canonical pathways affected mTOR signaling, EIF2 signaling, fatty acid activation, G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation, glycolysis protein ubiquitination. two CeO2 nanoparticles differed considerably genomic effects. active L respect altering pathways mitochondrial dysfunction, acute phase response, apoptosis, 14-3-3 mediated signaling, remodeling epithelial adherens junction signaling, actin nucleation ARP-WASP complex, altered TCA cycle elevated fatty acid concentrations metabolomics. However, L active respect pathways NRF2-mediated stress response hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation. One major difference cell response nano L nano caused Warburg effect nano L not.
