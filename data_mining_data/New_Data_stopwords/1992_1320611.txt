 Gold-labeled antibodies used examine subcellular locations 11 glycolytic fermentative enzymes Zymomonas mobilis. Glucose-fructose oxidoreductase clearly localized periplasmic region. Phosphogluconate lactonase alcohol dehydrogenase concentrated cytoplasm near plasma membrane. eight remaining enzymes evenly distributed within cytoplasmic matrix. Selected enzyme pairs labeled opposite sides thin section examine frequency colocalization. Results experiments provide evidence glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase form enzyme complex.
