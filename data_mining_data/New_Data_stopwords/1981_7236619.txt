 Bovine skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase covalently coupled Sepharose previously activated low concentrations cyanogen bromide. Reaction conditions chosen essentially tetrameric enzyme molecules covalently bound via single subunit. Denaturation immobilized enzyme guanidine hydrochloride followed removal noncovalently bound subunits amd denaturant resulted essentially enzymatic activity remaining bound resin. Thus, single immobilized subunits bovine pyruvate kinase inactive. Sepharose-bound enzymatic activity could recovered adding soluble renaturing enzyme subunits immobilized monomers. former combine noncovalently latter, presumably resulting re-formation bound tetramers, average recovery 61% original matrix-bound activity observed. interactions enzyme subunits appear necessary catalytic activity bovine muscle pyruvate kinase, subunit interactions apparently provided chemically modified subunits. Soluble, renaturing subunits enzyme inactivated treatment trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid able interact matrix-bound single subunits, thereby restoring enzymatic activity latter.
