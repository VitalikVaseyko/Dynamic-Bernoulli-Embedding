 effects O2 CO2 growth culture Trichomonas vaginalis strain C1-NIH investigated. Growth pre-purified N2 absence CO2 supplementation gave doubling time 4.4 h; traces O2 (less 0.25 microM) present, doubling time 3.5 h. Organisms grew rapidly (doubling time 2.3 h) traces O2 (less 0.25 microM) CO2 level controlled 5 mM. balance fermentation products maltose greatly influenced supplied gases. strictly anaerobic conditions 5 mM CO2, equimolar glycerol lactate accounted 95% measured products, whereas lower CO2 increased acetate production. microaerobic conditions (O2 less 0.25 microM) acetate major product CO2 limited evolved endogenously; 5 mM CO2 favoured glycerol lactate production. Activities key enzymes measured cell-free extracts (pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, hydrogenase, glycerol kinase, malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) lactate dehydrogenase) altered growth conditions commensurately observed changes metabolic flux patterns. results suggest T. vaginalis optimally adapted conditions experiences situ vagina (traces O2, high CO2).
