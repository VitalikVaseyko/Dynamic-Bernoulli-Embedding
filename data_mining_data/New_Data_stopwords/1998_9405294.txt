 study investigated whether conditions known alter activity phosphorylation state pyruvate dehydrogenase complex specific effects levels isoenzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) rat heart. Immunoblot analysis revealed remarkable increase amount PDK4 hearts rats starved rendered diabetic streptozotocin. Re-feeding starved rats insulin treatment diabetic rats effectively reversed increase PDK4 protein restored PDK enzyme activity levels chow-fed control rats. Starvation diabetes also markedly increased abundance PDK4 mRNA, re-feeding insulin treatment reduced levels message controls. contrast findings PDK4, little changes amounts PDK1 PDK2 protein abundance messages occurred response starvation diabetes. observed shift relative abundance PDK isoenzymes probably explains previous studies effects starvation diabetes heart PDK activity. results indicate control amount PDK4 important long-term regulation activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex rat heart.
