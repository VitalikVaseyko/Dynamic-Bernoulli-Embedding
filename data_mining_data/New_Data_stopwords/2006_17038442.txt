 study examined effects different oxygenation levels substrate availability cardiac performance, metabolism, biochemistry sexually immature male female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Ventricle strips electrically paced (0.5 Hz, 14 degrees C) hyperoxic hypoxic Ringer solution. results demonstrate 1) males sustain isometric force production (F) longer females hyperoxia (P O2 = 640 mmHg) exogenous glucose present; 2) contractility maintained moderate (P O2 = 130 mmHg) severe hypoxia (P O2 = 10-20 mmHg) glucose either sex; however, following reoxygenation, F higher females compared males; 3) female tissue higher lactate levels, net lactate efflux, lactate dehydrogenase activity males, whereas males higher glycogen, citrate synthase, beta-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, greater inotropic responses exogenous glucose octanoate. sex differences detected responsiveness epinephrine inhibitors glucose transport activities hexokinase pyruvate kinase. conclude sex differences exist rainbow trout cardiac tissue: females appear prefer glycolysis ATP production, whereas males higher capacity aerobic lipid metabolism.
