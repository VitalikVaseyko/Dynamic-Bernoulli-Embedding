 Cancer cells preferentially use glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation rapid growth. consume large amount glucose produce lactate even oxygen abundant, phenomenon known Warburg effect. metabolic change originates shift expression alternative spliced isoforms glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK), PKM1 PKM2. PKM1 constitutively active, PKM2 switched inactive dimer form active tetramer form small molecule activators. prevalence PKM2 cancer cells relative prevalence PKM1 many normal cells, suggests therapeutic strategy whereby activation PKM2 may counter abnormal cellular metabolism cancer cells, consequently decreased cellular proliferation. Herein describe discovery optimization series PKM2 activators derived 2-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4] dioxin-6-yl)thio)-1-(2-methyl-1-(methylsulfonyl)indolin-5-yl) ethanone scaffold. synthesis, SAR analysis, enzyme active site docking, enzymatic reaction kinetics, selectivity pharmaceutical properties discussed.
