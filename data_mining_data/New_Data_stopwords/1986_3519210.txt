 complete amino acid sequence cat muscle pyruvate kinase determined fitted 2.6 resolution electron density map. Residues active site region highly conserved cat muscle, chicken muscle, rat liver yeast enzymes. enzyme-bound magnesium, essential activity, interacts side chain glutamate-271 two main carbonyl groups. Lysine-269 probable acid/base catalyst responsible interconversion pyruvate enolpyruvate. possible binding site essential monovalent cation proposed.
