 Hepatocarcinogenesis hepatitis B virus transgenic mice studied means correlative cytomorphological cytochemical approach different time points animals 1 34 mo old. HBsAg-positive ground-glass hepatocytes emerged throughout liver parenchyma nearly transgenic mice first 4 mo birth. panlobular expression HBsAg persisted foci altered hepatocytes appeared (6 9 mo age). Three different types foci altered hepatocytes-namely, glycogen-storage foci, mixed cell foci glycogen-poor foci-developed. Hepatocellular adenomas carcinomas appeared 11 mo. Orcein staining revealed frequent transitions ground-glass hepatocytes extensively expressing HBsAg glycogen-storage (predominantly clear-cell) foci containing HBsAg-positive cytoplasmic components. Similar transitions ground-glass hepatocytes glycogenotic (clear) cells often found diffuse parenchymal glycogenosis 11 12 mo. Remnants HBsAg-positive material also detected mixed cell foci, glycogen-poor diffusely basophilic cell foci, hepatic adenoma hepatocellular carcinoma. findings suggest ground-glass hepatocytes direct precursor foci altered hepatocytes neoplastic descendants. extensive expression HBsAg gradually down-regulated neoplastic transformation, morphological biochemical phenotypes foci altered hepatocytes, hepatic adenoma hepatocellular carcinoma transgenic mice resemble described chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. predominant sequence cellular changes leading glycogen-storage (predominantly clear cell) foci mixed cell foci, hepatic adenoma hepatocellular carcinoma characterized gradual decrease activities glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, glucose-6-phosphatase adenylate cyclase, whereas glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities increase. alterations indicate shift glycogenotic state toward increase pentose phosphate pathway glycolysis.
