 fluorescent nucleotide analogues (the 5'-mono-, di-, triphosphates lin-benzoguanosine, lin-benzoxanthosine, lin-benzoinosine) prepared use dimensional probes enzyme binding sites. quantum yields aqueous solution 0.39, 0.55, 0.04 fluorescent lifetimes 6, 9, approximately equal 1.5 nsec, respectively. lin-Benzoinosine 5'-monophosphate substrate xanthine oxidase (xanthine:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.3.2), providing lin-benzoxanthosine 5'-monophosphate, lin-benzoinosine 5'-diphosphate substrate polynucleotide phosphorylase (polyribonucleotide:orthophosphate nucleotidyltransferase. EC 2.7.7.8), giving poly(lin-benzoinosinic acid). benzologues purine diphosphates substrates pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40), used prepare triphosphates.
