Review literature levels red cell metabolites 52 families PK deficiency confirmed rise 3PG valuable indicator functional deficiency PK. Estimation 3PG relatively easy (and accurate). Furthermore, reticulocytosis, sometimes makes diagnosis PK deficiency difficult, minimal effect level 3PG comparison glycolytic intermediates PK activity.
