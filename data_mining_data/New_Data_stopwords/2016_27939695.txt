 Cancer cells unique metabolic profile mitochondria shown play important role chemoresistance, tumor progression metastases. unique profile exploited mitochondrial-targeted anticancer therapies. small anticancer molecule, AG311, previously shown possess anticancer antimetastatic activity two cancer mouse models induce mitochondrial depolarization. study defines molecular effects AG311 mitochondria elucidate observed efficacy. AG311 found competitively inhibit complex activity ubiquinone-binding site. Complex target AG311 established measuring oxygen consumption rate tumor tissue isolated AG311-treated mice. Cotreatment cells animals AG311 dichloroacetate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor increases oxidative metabolism, resulted synergistic cell kill reduced tumor growth. inhibition mitochondrial oxygen consumption AG311 found reduce HIF-1alpha stabilization increasing oxygen tension hypoxic conditions. Taken together, results suggest AG311 least partially mediates antitumor effect inhibition complex I, could exploited use anticancer agent.
