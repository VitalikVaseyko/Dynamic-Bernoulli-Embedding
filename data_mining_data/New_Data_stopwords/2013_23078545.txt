 AMP deaminase (AMPD) catalyzes AMP IMP plays important role energy charge nucleotide metabolism. Human AMPD3 deficiency type erythrocyte-specific enzyme deficiency found individuals without clinical symptoms, although increased level ATP erythrocytes reported. better understand physiological pathological roles AMPD3 deficiency, established line AMPD3-deficient [A3(-/-)] mice. AMPD activity high level ATP observed erythrocytes mice, similar human RBC-AMPD3 deficiency, characteristics unremarkable. Next, created AMPD3 pyruvate kinase (PK) double-deficient [PKA(-/-,-/-)] mice mating A3(-/-) mice CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice [PK(-/-)], spontaneous PK-deficient strain showing hemolytic anemia. PKA(-/-,-/-) mice, level ATP red blood cells increased 1.5 times compared PK(-/-) mice, although hemolytic anemia animals improved. addition, observed osmotic fragility erythrocytes A3(-/-) mice fasting conditions. contrast, ATP level erythrocytes elevated A3(-/-) mice compared control. conclusion, AMPD3 deficiency increases level ATP erythrocytes, improve anemia due PK deficiency leads erythrocyte dysfunction.
