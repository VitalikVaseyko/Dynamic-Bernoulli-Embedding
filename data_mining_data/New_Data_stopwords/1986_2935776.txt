 hypothesized rapidly growing preterm infants would higher rates protein synthesis term infants, protein synthesis would closely related intracellular plasma levels amino acids. Neutrophils, used cell model, isolated 1-3 ml blood 63 infants 27-44 wk postconceptual age. Protein synthesis (3H-leucine incorporation, pmol/h/mg DNA), 19 amino acids leukocytes (nmol/mg DNA) plasma (nmol/ml) quantified. Protein synthesis related inversely birth weight gestational age, i.e. smaller preterm infant higher rate protein synthesis. Multiple regression analysis limited six steps indicated plasma amino acids (Val, Ile, Phe, Asp, Ala, Tau) accounted significant (p = 0.03), relatively small, proportion, 23%, variance protein synthesis. greater proportion variance protein synthesis explained set six intracellular amino acids (Leu, Met, Tyr, Gly, Ala, Tau), R2 = 36%, p = 0.001. Further, multiple regression identified specific combinations six plasma amino acids best explained ("predicted") levels intracellular amino acid predictor protein synthesis (R2 = 0.4-0.5, p less 0.001-0.0001). Activities rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase, correlated protein synthesis leukocytes (p = 0.036, 0.002, respectively). Phosphofructokinase, major regulating enzyme glycolysis, also negatively correlated birth weight gestational age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
