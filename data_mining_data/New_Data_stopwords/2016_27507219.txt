 mechanism Amifostine (WR-2721) mediated radioprotection poorly understood. effects amifostine human basal metabolism, mouse liver metabolism normal tumor hepatic cells studied. Indirect calorimetric canopy tests showed significant reductions oxygen consumption carbon dioxide emission cancer patients receiving amifostine. Glucose levels significantly decreased lactate levels increased patient venous blood. Although amifostine vitro inhibit activity prolyl-hydroxylase PHD2, experiments mouse liver showed short timescale WR-1065 induced expression Hypoxia Inducible Factor HIF1alpha, lactate dehydrogenase LDH5, glucose transporter GLUT2, phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase pPDH PDH-kinase. effect confirmed normal mouse NCTC hepatocytes, hepatoma cells. sharp reduction acetyl-CoA ATP levels NCTC cells indicated reduced mitochondrial usage pyruvate. Transient changes mitochondrial membrane potential reactive oxygen species ROS production evident. Amifostine selectively protects NCTC cells radiation, whilst HepG2 neoplastic cells sensitized. radiation protection correlates HIF levels. findings shed new light mechanism amifostine cytoprotection encourage clinical research agent treatment primary metastatic liver cancer.
