 1923, Dr. Warburg observed tumors acidified Ringer solution 13 mM glucose added, identified due lactate. glucose source nutrient, serve biosynthesis energy production. However, series studies revealed cancer cell consumes glucose biosynthesis fermentation, energy supply, physiological conditions. Recently, new observation made metabolic symbiosis glycolytic oxidative tumor cells mutually regulate energy metabolism. Hypoxic cancer cells use glucose glycolytic metabolism release lactate used oxygenated cancer cells. study challenged Warburg effect, Warburg claimed fermentation irreversible damaging mitochondria fundamental cause cancer. However, recent studies revealed mitochondria cancer cell show active function oxidative phosphorylation although TCA cycle stalled. also shown blocking cytosolic NADH production aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition, combined oxidative phosphorylation inhibition, resulted 80% decrease ATP production, resulted significant regression tumor growth NSCLC model. suggests new theory NADH production cytosol plays key role ATP production mitochondrial electron transport chain cancer cells, NADH production mostly occupied inside mitochondria normal cells.
