 Transgenic mouse technology provides direct genetic approach vivo carcinogenesis. order determine oncogenic potential activated ras gene liver, kidney intestine, created transgenic mice expressing human H-ras oncogene control L-type pyruvate-kinase gene. gene expressed hepatocytes, enterocytes, proximal tubular cells kidney endocrine pancreatic cells. Depending lines, observed hepatocarcinoma, polycystic kidney disease unexpected epididymis hyperplasia. transgenic mice interesting model polycystic kidney disease, complete study tissue-specificity oncogene action.
