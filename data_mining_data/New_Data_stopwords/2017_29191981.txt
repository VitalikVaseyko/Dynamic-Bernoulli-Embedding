 Recruitment fatty acids adipose tissue essential fasting. However, molecular mechanisms behind fasting-induced metabolic regulation human adipose tissue potential impact training state unknown. Therefore, aim present study investigate 1) fasting-induced regulation lipolysis glyceroneogenesis human adipose tissue well 2) impact training state basal oxidative capacity fasting-induced metabolic regulation human adipose tissue. Untrained (VO2max < 45ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) trained subjects (VO2max > 55ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) fasted 36h abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies obtained 2, 12, 24 36h standardized meal. Adipose tissue OXPHOS, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1alpha protein well PDH kinase (PDK) 2, PDK4 PDH phosphatase 2 mRNA content higher trained subjects untrained subjects. addition, trained subjects higher adipose tissue hormone sensitive lipase Ser660 phosphorylation adipose triglyceride lipase protein content well higher plasma free fatty acids concentration untrained subjects fasting. Moreover, adipose tissue PDH phosphorylation increased fasting trained subjects. Taken together, trained subjects seem possess higher basal adipose tissue oxidative capacity well higher capacity regulation lipolysis, glyceroneogenesis substrate availability adipose tissue untrained subjects.
