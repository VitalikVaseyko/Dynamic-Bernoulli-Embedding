 Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, halophilic, inducible Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) species, grown NaCl concentrations 20 400 millimolar rooting medium. Plants low salinity treatment showed exclusively C(3)-photosynthetic net CO(2) fixation, whereas plants exposed high salinity level exhibited net CO(2) dark fixation involving CAM. Mesophyll protoplasts, isolated tissues, gently ruptured, intracellular localization enzymes studied following differential centrifugation Percoll density gradient centrifugation protoplast extracts. centrifugation techniques resulted separation intact chloroplasts, 90% yield, organelles nonparticulate fraction cells. Enzymes identified determination activity sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis enzyme protein.Experiments established extraorganellar (cytoplasmic) location phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, enolase, phosphoglyceromutase, NADP-malic enzyme; mitochondrial location NAD-malic enzyme; chloroplastic location pyruvate, Pi dikinase. NAD-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphohexose isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase associated cytoplasm chloroplasts. NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase activity found chloroplastic extrachloroplastic fractions; activity chloroplast showed optimum pH 8.0 dependent upon preincubation enzyme dithiothreitol. extrachloroplastic activity showed optimum pH 6.5 independent pretreatment dithiothreitol. Protoplast extracts M. crystallinum performing CAM exhibited higher activities (expressed per mg chlorophyll per min) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate, Pi dikinase, NADP-malic enzyme, NAD-malic enzyme, NADP-malate dehydrogenase, enolase, phosphoglyceromutase, NAD-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphohexose isomerase protoplast extracts M. crystallinum exhibiting CAM. increase total activity latter three enzymes following exposure plants 400 millimolar NaCl development CAM due specific increases levels activity cytoplasm.
