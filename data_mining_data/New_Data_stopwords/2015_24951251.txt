 Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) one common inherited genetic diseases, caused mutations PKD1 and/ PKD2. Infertility reproductive tract abnormalities male ADPKD patients common higher incidence general population. work, reveal novel roles Pkd2 male reproductive system development. Disruption Pkd2 caused dilation mesonephric tubules/efferent ducts, failure epididymal coiling, defective testicular development. Deletion Pkd2 epithelia alone sufficient cause reproductive tract defects seen Pkd2(-/-) mice, suggesting epithelial Pkd2 plays pivotal role development maintenance male reproductive tract. testis, Pkd2 also plays role interstitial tissue testicular cord development. In-depth analysis epithelial-specific knockout mice revealed Pkd2 critical maintain cellular phenotype developmental signaling male reproductive system. Taken together, data first time reveal novel roles Pkd2 male reproductive system development provide new insights male reproductive system abnormality infertility ADPKD patients.
