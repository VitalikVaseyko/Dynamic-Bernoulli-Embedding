 report authors present results biochemical analyses human ejaculate. following parameters determined ATP, ADP, pyruvate, lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, fructose, myokinase, phosphoglucoseisomerase, phosphoglycerate-kinase, ATPase, acid phosphatase. found relationship age fructose content, equally pyruvate, whilst converse observed lactate. age dependend relationship observed substrates. ATP ADP distinctly higher values demonstrated normozoospermia. special study extent encyme activities sperm plasma associated respective pH values measured shows pH values 7.2 correlate distinctly lower activities acid phosphatase, PGI MK.
