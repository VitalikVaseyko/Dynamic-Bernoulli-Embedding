 Metabolically active hepatocytes prepared freeze-tolerant wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, used examine direct effects temperature freezing cryoprotectant synthesis assess effectiveness natural cryoprotectant glucose freezing preservation isolated cells. Freshly isolated hepatocytes showed slow leakage lactate dehydrogenase, readily synthesized urea, oxidized variety 14C-labeled substrates. Effects temperature glucose production isolated hepatocytes showed normal Arrhenius relationship. However, compared 0 degrees C control cells, either incubation higher temperatures freezing -3 degrees C reduced activity glycogen phosphorylase alpha. data suggest freezing-induced cryoprotectant production occurs vivo due direct action either low temperature freezing liver cell metabolism. natural cryoprotectant glucose also excellent cryoprotectant hepatocytes vitro. absence glucose, freezing caused substantial leakage lactate dehydrogenase isolated hepatocytes, rate leakage increasing freezing temperature decreased. Addition 200-600 mM glucose incubation medium (similar natural levels) fully protected cells damage freezing -4 -8 degrees C, normal freezing temperatures experienced frogs. Glucose also greatly improved freezing survival isolated frog hepatocytes ultralow temperatures (-80 -196 degrees C).
