 describe new enzymic colorimetric method urea measured serum use single reagent mixture. Ammonia produced urea hydrolysis, catalyzed urease, reacts glutamate ATP presence glutamine synthetase. ADP produced assayed reactions catalyzed sequentially pyruvate kinase pyruvate oxidase system generates hydrogen peroxide. hydrogen peroxide measured 500 550 nm reaction catalyzed horseradish peroxidase, phenol/4-aminophenazone chromogen. reaction complete 15 min 37 degrees C. standard curve linear urea concentration 40 mmol/L. Precision good; CVs ranged 2.5% 3.1%. Results present method compared well candidate Reference Method subject interferences commonly used drugs anticoagulants.
