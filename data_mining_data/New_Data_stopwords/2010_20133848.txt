 result genetic alterations tumor hypoxia, many cancer cells avidly take glucose generate lactate lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), encoded target gene c-Myc hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1). Previous studies reduction LDHA expression indicate LDHA involved tumor initiation, role tumor maintenance progression established. Furthermore, reduction LDHA expression interference antisense RNA inhibits tumorigenesis well understood. Here, report reduction LDHA siRNA inhibition small-molecule inhibitor (FX11 [3-dihydroxy-6-methyl-7-(phenylmethyl)-4-propylnaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid]) reduced ATP levels induced significant oxidative stress cell death could partially reversed antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Furthermore, document FX11 inhibited progression sizable human lymphoma pancreatic cancer xenografts. used combination NAD(+) synthesis inhibitor FK866, FX11 induced lymphoma regression. Hence, inhibition LDHA FX11 achievable tolerable treatment LDHA-dependent tumors. studies document therapeutical approach Warburg effect demonstrate oxidative stress metabolic phenotyping cancers critical aspects cancer biology consider therapeutical targeting cancer energy metabolism.
