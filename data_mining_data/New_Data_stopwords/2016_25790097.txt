 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) acts crossroad growth metabolism pathways cells. PKM2 regulation growth factors redirect glycolytic intermediates key biosynthetic pathway. show IGF1 regulate glycolysis rate, stimulate PKM2 Ser/Thr phosphorylation decrease cellular pyruvate kinase activity. Upon IGF1 treatment found increase dimeric form PKM2 enrichment PKM2 nucleus. effect associated reduction pyruvate kinase enzymatic activity reversed using metformin, decreases Akt phosphorylation. IGF1 induced increased nuclear localization PKM2 STAT3, correlated increased HIF1alpha, HK2, GLUT1 expression glucose entrapment. Metformin inhibited HK2, GLUT1, HIF-1alpha expression glucose consumption. findings suggest role IGFIR/Akt axis regulating glycolysis Ser/Thr PKM2 phosphorylation cancer cells.
