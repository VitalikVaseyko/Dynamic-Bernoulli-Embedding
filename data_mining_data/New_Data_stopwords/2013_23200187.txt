 Oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) target hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-alpha subunits proteasomal degradation normoxia hydroxylation. Recently, novel mechanisms PHD activation function unveiled. Interestingly, PHD3 unexpectedly amplify HIF signaling hydroxylation glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) muscle isoform 2 (PKM2). Recent studies also yielded insight HIF-independent PHD functions, including control alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking synaptic transmission activation transient receptor potential cation channel member A1 (TRPA1) ion channels oxygen levels sensory nerves. Finally, PHD activation shown involve iron chaperoning function poly(rC) binding protein (PCBP)1 (R)-enantiomer 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). intersection regulatory pathways interactions highlight complexity PHD regulation function.
