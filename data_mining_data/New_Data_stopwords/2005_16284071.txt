 tested whether hypoxia-induced coronary artery dilatation could mediated increase adenosine concentration within coronary artery wall increase adenosine sensitivity. Porcine left anterior descendent coronary arteries, precontracted prostaglandin F(2alpha) (10(-5) M), mounted pressure myograph microdialysis catheters inserted tunica media. Dialysate adenosine concentrations analysed HPLC. Glucose, lactate pyruvate measured automated spectrophotometric kinetic enzymatic analyser. exchange fraction [(14)C]adenosine microdialysis membrane increased 0.32 +/- 0.02 0.46 +/- 0.02 (n = 4, P < 0.01) study period. baseline, interstitial adenosine region 10 nM significantly less previously found myocardial concentrations. Hypoxia (P(O(2)) 30 mmHg 60 min, n = 5) increased coronary diameters 20.0 +/- 2.6% (versus continuous oxygenation -3.1 +/- 2.4%, n = 6, P < 0.001) interstitial adenosine concentration fell. Blockade adenosine deaminase (with erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl-)-adenine, 5 microM), adenosine kinase (with iodotubericidine, 10 microM) adenosine transport (with n-nitrobenzylthioinosine, 1 microM) increased interstitial adenosine increase unrelated hypoxia diameter. coronary dilatation similar hypoxia could obtained 30 microM adenosine organ bath resulting interstitial adenosine concentrations (n = 5) 20 times higher adenosine concentration measured hypoxia. Adenosine concentration-response experiments showed vasodilatation pronounced hypoxia (n = 9) normoxia (n = 9, P < 0.001) A(2A) receptor antagonist ZM241385 (20 nM, n = 5), attenuated hypoxia-induced vasodilatation selective A(2B) receptor antagonist MRS1754 (20 nM, n = 4), effect. lactate/pyruvate ratio significantly increased hypoxic arteries correlate adenosine concentration. conclude hypoxia-induced coronary artery dilatation mediated increased adenosine produced within artery wall might facilitated increased adenosine sensitivity A(2A) receptor level.
