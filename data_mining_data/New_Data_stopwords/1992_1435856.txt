 multiplication malaria parasites within red blood cells energy dependent. Since parasites lack functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, energy needs parasite met anaerobic glycolysis exogenous glucose. High levels glycolytic enzymes fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase pyruvate kinase detected infected erythrocytes. report 4-9 times increase glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) activity infected erythrocytes normal erythrocytes. increase parasitic origin, additional enzyme bands observed lysates infected erythrocytes. expression GPI parallels parasite maturation reaches maximum trophozoite/schizont stage. Two distinct closely related activity patterns consisting 3-4 GPI isoenzymes (not shown normal erythrocytes) neutral weakly acidic isoelectric points observed 6 P. falciparum isolates tested isoelectric focusing. purified P. falciparum GPI apparent size 66 kDa. size variation observed 6 P. falciparum isolates studied. Furthermore, antiserum raised protein BALB/c mice specifically inhibits parasite encoded GPI activity effect observed host enzyme activity.
