 Fasting prompts metabolic shift substrate utilization carbohydrate predominant fat oxidation skeletal muscle, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) seen controlling link competitive oxidation carbohydrate fat metabolic challenges like fasting. Interleukin (IL)-6 proposed released muscle concomitant effects glucose fat utilization. aim test hypothesis muscle IL-6 regulatory impact fasting-induced suppression skeletal muscle PDH. Skeletal muscle-specific IL-6 knockout (IL-6 MKO) mice floxed littermate controls (control) either fed fasted 6 18 h. Lack muscle IL-6 elevated respiratory exchange ratio fed early fasting state, prolonged fasting. Activity PDH active form (PDHa) higher fed fasted IL-6 MKO control mice 18 h, 6 h, whereas lack muscle IL-6 prevent downregulation PDHa activity skeletal muscle changes plasma muscle substrate levels response 18 h fasting. Phosphorylation three four sites PDH-E1alpha increased 18 h fasting, lower IL-6 MKO mice control. addition, PDK4 mRNA protein increased 6 18 h fasting genotypes, PDK4 protein lower IL-6 MKO control. conclusion, skeletal muscle IL-6 seems regulate whole body substrate utilization fed, fasted, state influence skeletal muscle PDHa activity circadian manner. However, skeletal muscle IL-6 required maintaining metabolic flexibility response fasting.
