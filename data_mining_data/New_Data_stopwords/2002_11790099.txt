 Crystals pyruvate phosphate dikinase complex substrate analogue inhibitor, phosphonopyruvate (K(i) = 3 microM), obtained presence Mg(2+). structure determined refined 2.2 resolution, revealing Mg(2+)-bound phosphonopyruvate binds alpha/beta-barrel's central channel, C-termini beta-strands. mode binding resembles closely previously proposed PEP substrate binding mode, inferred homology structure (but sequence homology) pyruvate kinase. Kinetic analysis site-directed mutants, probing residues involved inhibitor binding, showed mutations resulted inactivation, confirming key role residues play catalysis. Comparison structure PPDK-phosphonopyruvate complex structures two complexes pyruvate kinase, one Mg(2+)-bound phospholactate Mg(2+)-oxalate ATP, revealed two enzymes share key features facilitate common modes substrate binding. also important structural differences; notably, machinery acid/base catalysis different.
