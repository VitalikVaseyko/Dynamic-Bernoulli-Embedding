 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) catalyzes phosphorylation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Two isoforms mitochondrial kinase (PDK2 PDK4) induced tissue-specific manner response starvation diabetes. Inactivation PDC increased PDK activity promotes gluconeogenesis conserving three-carbon substrates. helps maintain glucose levels starvation, detrimental diabetes. Factors regulate PDK2 PDK4 expression examined Morris hepatoma 7800 C1 cells. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonist WY-14,643 glucocorticoid dexamethasone increased PDK4 mRNA levels. Neither compound affected half-life PDK4 message, suggesting increase gene transcription. Fatty acids caused increase PDK4 message comparable induced WY-14,643. Insulin prevented reversed stimulatory effects dexamethasone PDK4 gene expression, less effective stimulatory effects WY-14,643 fatty acids. Insulin also decreased abundance PDK2 message. findings suggest decreased levels insulin increased levels fatty acids glucocorticoids promote PDK4 gene expression starvation diabetes. decreased level insulin likely responsible increase PDK2 mRNA level starvation diabetes.
