 OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance causes type 2 diabetes mellitus hyperglycemia due excessive hepatic glucose production inadequate peripheral glucose uptake. objectives test hypothesis proposed CREB/CRTC2 inhibitor salt inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) contributes whole body glucose homeostasis vivo regulating hepatic transcription gluconeogenic genes also identify novel SIK1 actions glucose metabolism. METHODS: created conditional (floxed) SIK1-knockout mice studied glucose metabolism animals global, liver, adipose skeletal muscle Sik1 deletion. examined cAMP-dependent regulation SIK1 consequences SIK1 depletion primary mouse hepatocytes. probed metabolic phenotypes tissue-specific SIK1 knockout mice fed high fat diet hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps biochemical analysis insulin signaling. RESULTS: SIK1 knockout mice viable largely normoglycemic chow diet. high fat diet, global SIK1 knockout animals strikingly protected glucose intolerance, increased plasma insulin enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity. Surprisingly, liver SIK1 required regulation CRTC2 gluconeogenesis, despite contributions SIK1 hepatocyte CRTC2 gluconeogenesis regulation ex vivo. Sik1 mRNA accumulates skeletal muscle obese high fat diet-fed mice, knockout SIK1 skeletal muscle, liver adipose tissue, improves insulin sensitivity muscle glucose uptake high fat diet. CONCLUSIONS: SIK1 dispensable glycemic control chow diet. SIK1 promotes insulin resistance high fat diet cell-autonomous mechanism skeletal muscle. study establishes SIK1 promising therapeutic target improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity obese individuals without deleterious effects hepatic glucose production.
