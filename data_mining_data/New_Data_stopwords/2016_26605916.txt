 BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnosis time-sensitive illnesses stroke, cardiac arrest, septic shock essential successful treatment. Much attention therefore focused new strategies rapid objective diagnosis, Point-of-Care Tests (PoCT) blood biomarkers. use biomimicry-based approach demonstrate new diagnostic platform, based enzymes tethered nanoparticles (NPs). proof principle, use oriented immobilization pyruvate kinase (PK) luciferase (Luc) silica NPs achieve rapid sensitive detection neuron-specific enolase (NSE), clinically relevant biomarker multiple diseases ranging acute brain injuries lung cancer. hypothesize approach capitalizing speed catalytic nature enzymatic reactions would enable fast sensitive biomarker detection, suitable PoCT devices. METHODS FINDINGS: performed in-vitro, animal model, human subject studies. First, efficiency coupled enzyme activities tethered NPs versus solution tested, demonstrating highly sensitive rapid detection physiological pathological concentrations NSE. Next, rat stroke models enzyme-based assay able minutes show statistically significant increase NSE levels samples taken 1 hour 0, 1, 3 6 hours occlusion distal middle cerebral artery. Finally, using tethered enzyme assay detection NSE samples 20 geriatric human patients, show data match well (r = 0.815) current gold standard biomarker detection, ELISA-with major difference achieve detection 10 minutes opposed several hours required traditional ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Oriented enzyme immobilization conferred efficient coupled activity, thus higher assay sensitivity, non-tethered enzymes. Together, findings provide proof concept using oriented immobilization active enzymes NPs basis highly rapid sensitive biomarker detection platform. addresses key challenge developing PoCT platform time sensitive difficult diagnose pathologies.
