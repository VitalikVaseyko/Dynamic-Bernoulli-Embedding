 B cell activation leads proliferation Ab production protect pathogens promote autoimmunity. Regulation cell metabolism essential support demands lymphocyte growth effector function may regulate tolerance. study, tested regulation role glucose uptake metabolism proliferation Ab production control, anergic, autoimmune-prone B cells. Control B cells balanced increase lactate production oxygen consumption following activation, proportionally increased glucose transporter Glut1 expression mitochondrial mass upon either LPS BCR stimulation. contrasted metabolic reprogramming cells, lower glycolytic flux resting disproportionately increased pathway upon activation. Importantly, tolerance greatly affected B cell metabolic reprogramming. Anergic B cells remained metabolically quiescent, modest increase glycolysis oxygen consumption LPS stimulation. B cells chronically stimulated elevated BAFF, however, rapidly increased glycolysis Ab production upon stimulation. Induction glycolysis critical Ab production, glycolytic inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate sharply suppressed B cell proliferation Ab secretion vitro vivo. Furthermore, B cell-specific deletion Glut1 led reduced B cell numbers impaired Ab production vivo. Together, data show activated B cells require Glut1-dependent metabolic reprogramming support proliferation Ab production distinct cells glycolytic reprogramming regulated tolerance.
