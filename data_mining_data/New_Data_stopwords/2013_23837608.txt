 BACKGROUND: Insulin tightly associated cancer progression; however, mechanistic insights observations poorly understood. Recent studies show metabolic transformation critical cancer cell proliferation. Here, attempt understand role insulin promotion cancer metabolism. end, role insulin regulating glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) examined. RESULTS: observed insulin up-regulated PKM2 expression, PI3K/mTOR mediated HIF1alpha induction, significantly reduced PKM2 activity independent pathway. Drop PKM2 activity attributed subunit dissociation leading formation low activity PKM2 oligomers, assessed density gradient centrifugation. However, tyrosine 105 phosphorylation PKM2, known inhibiting PKM2 activity, remained unaffected insulin treatment. Interestingly, insulin-induced ROS found responsible PKM2 activity reduction. observed changes PKM2 status led augmented cancer metabolism. Insulin-induced PKM2 up-regulation resulted enhanced aerobic glycolysis confirmed PKM2 knockdown studies. Further, PKM2 activity reduction led characteristic pooling glycolytic intermediates increased accumulation NADPH; suggesting diversion glucose flux towards macromolecular synthesis, necessary cancer cell growth. CONCLUSION: study identifies new PKM2-mediated effects insulin cancer metabolism, thus, advancing understanding insulin's role cancer.
