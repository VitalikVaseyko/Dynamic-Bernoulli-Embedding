 Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) regulates IGF availability glucose homeostasis. IGFBP-1 promoter shares common regulatory response elements phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), expression activity inhibited lithium chloride, associated inhibition glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 activity, rat hepatoma cell line H4-II-E. therefore determined effect lithium chloride IGFBP-1 expression secretion H4-II-E cells. Lithium chloride inhibited IGFBP-1 secretion dose response reversible manner approx 80% 5-h 16-h incubations. inhibitory effect IGFBP-1 mRNA expression observed 2 h. inhibitory effect lithium insulin additive used alone, inhibition lithium occurred insulin action blocked activating AMP-activated protein kinase 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR). findings suggest GSK-3 inhibition, another pathway activated lithium, may involved pathway controlling IGFBP-1, inhibiting synthesis insulin activity absent impaired.
