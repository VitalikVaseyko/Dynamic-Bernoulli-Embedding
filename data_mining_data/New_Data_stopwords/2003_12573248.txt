 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) mitochondrial enzyme responsible regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and, consequently, aerobic oxidation carbohydrate fuels general. mammals, four genetically biochemically distinct forms PDK expressed tissue-specific manner (PDK1, PDK2, PDK3, PDK4). protein kinases shown function dimers, possibility heterodimerization various isozyme subunits yet investigated. Here, demonstrate two members PDK family, PDK1 PDK2, form heterodimeric species coexpressed Escherichia coli cell. heterodimeric kinase produced vivo purified near homogeneity affinity chromatography. purified kinase stable subjected reassortment subunits. heterodimeric kinase catalytically active clearly distinct homodimeric PDK1 PDK2 respect kinetic parameters, site specificity regulation. data strongly suggest heterodimerization PDK1 PDK2 adds another level diversity protein family addition arises gene multiplicity.
