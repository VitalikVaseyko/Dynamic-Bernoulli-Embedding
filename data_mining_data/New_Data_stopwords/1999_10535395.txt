 effects sesamin, one abundant lignans sesame seed, hepatic fatty acid oxidation examined rats fed experimental diets containing various amounts (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%) sesamin (a 1:1 mixture sesamin episesamin) 15 days. Dietary sesamin dose-dependently increased mitochondrial peroxisomal palmitoyl-coenzyme (CoA) oxidation rates. Mitochondrial activity almost doubled rats 0.5% sesamin diet. Peroxisomal activity increased 10-fold rats fed 0.5% sesamin diet relation rats sesamin-free diet. Dietary sesamin greatly increased hepatic activity fatty acid oxidation enzymes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, acyl-CoA oxidase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. Dietary sesamin also increased activity 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase delta3,delta2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, enzymes involved auxiliary pathway beta-oxidation unsaturated fatty acids dose-dependently. Examination hepatic mRNA levels using specific cDNA probes showed sesamin-induced increase gene expression mitochondrial peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation enzymes. Among various enzymes, peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase bifunctional enzyme gene expression affected dietary sesamin (15- 50-fold increase 0.5% dietary level). Sesamin-induced alterations activity gene expression carnitine palmitoyltransferase acyl-CoA oxidase parallel changes mitochondrial peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidation rate, respectively. contrast, dietary sesamin decreased hepatic activity mRNA abundance fatty acid synthase pyruvate kinase, lipogenic enzymes. However, lignan increased activity gene expression malic enzyme, another lipogenic enzyme. alteration hepatic fatty acid metabolism may therefore account serum lipid-lowering effect sesamin rat.
