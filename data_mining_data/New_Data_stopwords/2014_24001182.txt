 Sarcopenia describes age-related decline skeletal muscle mass, strength, function ultimately impairs metabolism leads poor balance, frequent falling, limited mobility, reduction quality life. investigate pathogenesis sarcopenia proteomic shotgun approach. brief, employed tandem mass tags quantitate compare protein profiles obtained young versus old rat slow-twitch type muscle (soleus) fast-twitch type muscle (extensor digitorum longus, EDL). results disclose 3452 1848 proteins identified soleus EDL muscles samples, 78 174 found differentially expressed, respectively. general, proteins structural related involved energy metabolism, oxidative stress, detoxification, transport. Aging affected soleus EDL muscles differently, several proteins regulated opposite ways. example, pyruvate kinase expression activity different soleus EDL muscles. able verify existing literature many differentially expressed proteins candidate aging biomarkers and, importantly, disclose several new candidate biomarkers glioblastoma amplified sequence, zero beta-globin, prolargin.
