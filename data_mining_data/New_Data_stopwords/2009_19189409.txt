 Given availability, low prices, high degree reduction, glycerol become ideal feedstock production reduced compounds. anaerobic fermentation glycerol Escherichia coli could excellent platform purpose requires expensive nutrients tryptone yeast extract. work, microaerobic conditions used means eliminating need rich nutrients. Availability low amounts oxygen enabled redox balance preserving ability synthesize reduced products. fermentation balance analysis showed approximately 95% recovery carbon reducing equivalents. pathways involved glycerol dissimilation identified using different genetic biochemical approaches. Respiratory (GlpK-GlpD/GlpABC) fermentative (GldA-DhaKLM) routes mediated conversion glycerol glycolytic intermediates. Although pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) pyruvate dehydrogenase contributed synthesis acetyl-CoA pyruvate, carbon flux proceeded PFL. pathways mediating synthesis acetate ethanol required efficient utilization glycerol. microaerobic metabolism glycerol harnessed engineering strains co-production ethanol hydrogen (EH05 [pZSKLMgldA]), ethanol formate (EF06 [pZSKLMgldA]). High ethanol yields achieved genetic manipulations reduced synthesis by-products succinate, acetate, lactate. Co-production hydrogen required use acidic pH formate co-production facilitated inactivation enzyme formate-hydrogen lyase. High rates product synthesis realized overexpressing glycerol dehydrogenase (GldA) dihydroxyacetone kinase (DhaKLM). Engineered strains efficiently produced ethanol hydrogen ethanol formate glycerol minimal medium without rich supplements.
