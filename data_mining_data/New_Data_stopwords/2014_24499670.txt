 Cell proliferation delicately regulated process couples growth signals metabolic demands produce daughter cells. Interestingly, proliferation tumor cells immensely depends glycolysis, Warburg effect, ensure sufficient amount metabolic flux bioenergetics macromolecule synthesis cell division. unique metabolic derangement would provide opportunity developing cancer therapeutic strategy, particularly diverse anti-cancer treatments proved ineffective achieving durable response, largely due emergence resistance. Recent advances deeper understanding cancer metabolism usher new horizons next generation strategy cancer therapy. Here, discuss focused review cancer energy metabolism, therapeutic exploitation glycolysis OXPHOS novel anti-cancer strategy, particular emphasis promise approach, among cancer metabolism targeted therapies reveal unexpected complexity context-dependent metabolic adaptability, complicating development effective strategies.
