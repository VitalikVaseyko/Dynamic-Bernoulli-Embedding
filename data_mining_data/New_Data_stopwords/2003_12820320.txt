 lung cancer patients tumor markers used disease monitoring. goal study improve diagnostic efficiency detection tumor progression lung cancer patients using fuzzy logic modeling combination tumor marker panel (Tumor M2-PK, CYFRA 21-1, CEA, NSE SCC). Thirty-three small cell lung cancers (SCLC) 69 consecutive inoperable patients (40 squamous 29 adenocarcinomas) included prospective study. changes blood levels tumor markers well analysis fuzzy logic modelling compared clinical evaluation response vs. non-response therapy. Clinical monitoring evaluated according standard criteria WHO. Tumor M2-PK measured plasma ELISA (ScheBo Biotech, Germany) markers sera (Roche, Germany). 90% specificity, respective best single marker found following fraction patients tumor progression clinically detected: SCLC NSE 52%, adenocarcinoma CYFRA 21-1 89% squamous carcinoma SCC 65%. fuzzy logic rule-based system employing tumor marker panel increased sensitivity small cell carcinomas 73% marker combination NSE/CEA 63% marker combination NSE/Tumor M2-PK, respectively. squamous carcinomas improvement sensitivity also observed using marker combination SCC/Tumor M2-PK (Sensitivity: 81%) SCC/CEA (Sensitivity: 71%). using fuzzy logic method marker combination CYFRA 21-1/CEA well CYFRA 21-1/Tumor M2-PK, detection lung cancer progression possible adenocarcinomas. fuzzy logic method tumor marker panel (including new marker Tumor M2-PK), useful diagnostic tool detection progression lung cancer patients available.
