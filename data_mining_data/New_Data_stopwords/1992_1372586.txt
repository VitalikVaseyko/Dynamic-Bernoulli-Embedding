 Since isolation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) characterization main mutation (delta F508) 1989, large number rare mutations found. Full screening CFTR gene difficult split 27 exons covering 250 kb genomic DNA. gene essentially expressed lung intestinal tract, neither easily accessible routine investigations. recent description faint transcription highly tissue-specific genes cell, phenomenon known illegitimate transcription, would facilitate research mutations characterization truncated m-RNA caused splicing mutations. Using polymerase chain reaction cDNA (cDNA-PCR), detected transcripts CFTR gene lymphocytes lymphoblast cells low level (about 300 times less lung intestine). strategy allowed us obtain sufficient amount cDNA-PCR product compatible molecular analyses. have, therefore, analyzed cDNA fragment overlapping exons 10 11 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis direct sequencing, detected delta F508 mutation level. protocol generalized investigation total 4.5-kb CFTR coding sequence.
