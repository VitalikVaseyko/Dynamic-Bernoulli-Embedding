 CHRC, corolla-specific carotenoid-associated protein, major component carotenoid-lipoprotein complexes Cucumis sativus chromoplasts. Using vitro flower bud culture system mimics vivo flower development, CHRC mRNA levels corollas shown specifically up-regulated gibberellic acid. response gibberellic acid rapid (within 20 min) insensitive protein synthesis inhibition cycloheximide. Abscisic acid, known antagonize gibberellin many developmental systems, strongly down-regulated CHRC mRNA levels. gibberellin synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol exhibited similar negative effect CHRC expression. Inclusion exogenous gibberellic acid vitro bud culture system paclobutrazol prevented CHRC mRNA down-regulation, up-regulated transcript accumulation level gibberellic acid-treated corollas. CHRC mRNA accumulation response gibberellic acid displayed dose-dependent increase 10(-4) gibberellic acid. up-regulation could detected little 10(-7) gibberellic acid. Based data, suggest CHRC first structural gene identified date whose expression regulated gibberellic acid primary fashion. critical role rapid response CHRC gibberellic acid aiding carotenoid sequestration preserving chromoplast structural organization discussed.
