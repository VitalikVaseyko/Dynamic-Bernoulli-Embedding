 Experimental alcoholic myopathy induced rats combination prolonged alcohol intake (mean 15.3 g ethanol/kg/day 10 weeks) short fast. view literature evidence impairment glycolytic oxidative metabolism alcoholic myopathy, combined histological histochemical observations biochemical studies comprising assay glycolytic enzymes measurement respiration rates cytochrome content isolated intact mitochondria. predominant histological finding Type IIb fibre atrophy, levels glycolytic enzymes aldolase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase significantly depressed. Evidence rhabdomyolysis seen minority animals. Mean mitochondrial respiratory rates significantly lower Site substrate glutamate alcohol-treated animals. postulated chronic alcoholic myopathy associated glycolytic deficiency acute rhabdomyolysis may arise superimposed mitochondrial failure, resulting severe energy crisis muscle.
