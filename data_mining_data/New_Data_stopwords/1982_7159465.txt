 Acyclovir diphosphate (acyclo-GDP) metabolite antiviral drug acyclovir [9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine]. Seven enzymes capable catalyzing phosphorylation GDP dGDP (nucleoside diphosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase adenylosuccinate synthetase) also catalyzed phosphorylation acyclo-GDP. general, acyclo-GDP lower V'max higher K'm either GDP dGDP. None enzymes showed significantly higher rates phosphorylation GDP acyclo-GDP herpes simplex virus-infected Vero cells compared uninfected Vero cells. contribution enzyme phosphorylation acyclo-GDP vivo estimated kinetic data partially purified enzymes, level enzyme Vero cells, physiological concentrations substrates inhibitors. relative order estimated rates acyclo-GDP phosphorylation Vero cells phosphoglycerate kinase much greater pyruvate kinase greater phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase greater nucleoside diphosphate kinase greater succinyl-CoA synthetase greater creatine kinase greater adenylosuccinate synthetase. calculated potential acyclo-GDP phosphorylation enzymes adequate account amounts acyclo-GTP formed cell culture.
