 mdx mutant mouse first observed survey genetic variations pyruvate kinase mouse. Affected mice high serum levels enzyme although showing little disability widespread severe muscle disease. Light electron microscopy, muscle enzyme histochemistry combined cholinesterase-silver impregnations used study affected control animals aged 1 day 1 year. early ultrastructural abnormality present already 1 day scattered focal streaming Z-lines. Later also segmental muscle fibre necrosis regeneration. proportion muscle fibres showing either necrosis, regeneration internal nuclei assessed several muscles, ages ranging 10 days 1 year. Acute segmental necrosis regeneration marked 1 2 months, although present ages. number fibres internal nuclei increased progressively 3 months 70-80% showed abnormality. Nerve terminals unaffected reduction number depth postsynaptic folds motor end-plates adult animals, confirmed morphometric analysis. Quantitative study L4 motor root tibial nerve showed fibre numbers, axonal calibres myelin sheath thickness normal ages. qualitative abnormalities found CNS organs. findings strongly suggest mdx mutant primary muscle disease nervous system normal.
