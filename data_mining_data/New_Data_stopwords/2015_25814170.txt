 PURPOSE: Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) congenital muscular dystrophy rarely reported outside Japan. Here, report three patients Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) China shared similar clinical phenotype 3-kb insertion FKTN 3' untranslated region. METHODS: Immunofluorescence staining undertaken muscle biopsies three patients using alpha dystroglycan antibody (IIH6). Genomic DNA patients parents extracted peripheral blood leukocytes. Polymerase chain reaction DNA sequencing employed analyze exons surrounding intron sequences fukutin (FKTN) gene detect mutations. Haplotype analysis also performed patient parents. RESULTS: patients delayed mental motor development, febrile convulsions, muscle weakness, moderate significant raised levels serum creatine kinase (7000-11,160 U/L, 25-60xnormal). Brain MRI scans showed micropolygyria extensive dysplasia white matter brainstem. Electromyography revealed myopathic changes. Muscle immunofluorescence studies demonstrated reduced IIH6 staining. Genetic testing showed compound heterozygous mutations FKTN. Cases 1 2 c.139C>T (p.Arg47( *)) heterozygous mutation. Case 3 c.346C>T (p.Gln116( *)) heterozygous mutation. CONCLUSION: patients heterozygous 3-kb insertion FKTN 3' untranslated region. Haplotype analyses suggested patients haplotype Japanese patients.
