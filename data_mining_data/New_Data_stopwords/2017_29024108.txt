 study aimed evaluate hepatic glucose lipid metabolism-related parameters adult male female White King pigeons (Columba livia) incubation chick rearing. day 4 (I4), 10 (I10) 17 (I17) incubation day 1 (R1), 7 (R7), 15 (R15) 25 (R25) chick rearing, livers sampled six pigeons sex. Glycogen fat contents, activities glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, HK; 6-phosphofructokinase, 6-PFK), genes expressions key enzymes involved glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, PK; glucokinase, GK), gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase cytosolic, PCK1; fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, FBP1; glucose-6-phosphatase, G6Pase), fatty acid synthesis (fatty acid synthase, FAS; acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ACC) fatty acid beta-oxidation (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, CPT1; acyl-CoA 1, ACO) measured. male female pigeon livers, glycogen content HK activity dramatically increased I17 R1, respectively; expressions FBP1 G6Pase genes maximized R15; activity 6-PFK expressions PK CPT1 genes highest R7; fat content expressions FAS ACC genes steeply increased I10 R1. females, hepatic expressions GK PCK1 genes greatest R7 I17, respectively; however, males, maximized R15. Hepatic expression ACO gene significantly enhanced R1 compared I17 R7 males, whereas notably up-regulated I17 R7 females. Furthermore, expressions PCK1, GK, FAS ACC genes significant relation fat content livers female pigeons, fat content male pigeons highly correlated expression PCK1, ACC, CPT1 ACO genes. conclusion, regulations glucose lipid metabolic processes enhanced parent pigeon livers terminal phases incubation mid phase chick rearing sexual effects.
