 Twenty-two hypothalamic amenorrheic patients, non-smokers normal weight, received replacement therapy 1 month transdermal patches containing 8 mg estradiol. drugs prescribed taken study. treatment (time 0) 1 month start, blood samples taken assay plasma estradiol levels, erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), age-dependent erythrocyte enzyme activity, pyruvate kinase. Plasma malondialdehyde levels, index lipoperoxidation products, also detected. results showed significant variations superoxide dismutase, catalase, pyruvate kinase erythrocyte enzyme activities plasma malondialdehyde levels. significant increase plasma estradiol levels (time 0, 17.33 +/- 4.12 pg/ml; 1 month, 81.25 +/- 10.45 pg/ml; means +/- SD; p < 0.0001) GSH-Px erythrocyte activity (time 0, 11.97 +/- 2.31 IU/g hemoglobin; 1 month, 16.88 +/- 4.38 IU/g hemoglobin; p < 0.004) found. Plasma estradiol levels correlated significantly GSH-Px erythrocyte activity 1 month therapy begun (r = 0.776, p < 0.003). suggest estrogens restored physiological plasma levels, stimulate erythrocyte antioxidant GSH-Px activity, improving antioxidant power amenorrheic patients.
