 oncoprotein c-Myc frequently overexpressed many cancers essential cancer cell proliferation. Ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation one main ways cells control c-Myc abundance post-translational level. However, underlying mechanism c-Myc directly deubiquitinated fully understood. study, screening ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) may regulate c-Myc stability, identified USP37 novel deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) stabilizes c-Myc via direct binding. overexpression USP37 markedly increases c-Myc abundance blocking degradation, whereas depletion USP37 promotes c-Myc degradation reduces c-Myc levels. studies indicate USP37 directly interacts c-Myc deubiquitinates c-Myc DUB activity-dependent manner. Functionally, USP37 regulates cell proliferation Warburg effect regulating c-Myc levels. Clinically, USP37 significantly upregulated human lung cancer tissues, expression positively correlated c-Myc protein expression. Thus, findings uncover previously unrecognized role USP37 regulation c-Myc stability lung cancer suggest USP37 might potential therapeutic target treatment lung cancer.
