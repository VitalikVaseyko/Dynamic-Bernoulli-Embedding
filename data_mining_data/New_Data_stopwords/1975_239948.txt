 5-Oxo-L-prolinase, enzyme catalyzes conversion 5-oxo-L-proline (L-pyroglutamate; L-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate) L-glutamate coupled cleavage ATP ADP Pi, purified 1600-fold rat kidney. Purification carried presence 5-oxo-L-proline protects enzyme variety conditions. estimate molecular weight (about 325,000) made gel filtration Sephadex G-200. K+ (or NH4+) Mg2+ required activity. GTP, ITP, CTP, UTP much less active ATP; dATP 43% active ATP. ADP inhibited addition pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate activated reaction. enzyme, protected storage dithiothreitol, inhibited p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide. apparent Km values 5-oxo-L-proline ATP are, respectively, 0.05 0.17 mM. pH profile indicates broad range activity pH 5.5 pH 11.2 apparent maxima pH 7 pH 9.7. formation Pi glutamate equimolar wide pH range. enzyme incubated ATP, Mg2+, K+, L-2-imidazolidone-4-carboxylate L-dihydroorotate, cleavage ATP ADP Pi occurred, cleavage imino acid substrates observed; enzyme incubated conditions 2-piperidone-6-carboxylate, 4-oxy-5-oxoproline, 3-oxy-5-oxoproline, corresponding dicarboxylic amino acids formed, molar ratio Pi amino acid formation significantly greater unity.
