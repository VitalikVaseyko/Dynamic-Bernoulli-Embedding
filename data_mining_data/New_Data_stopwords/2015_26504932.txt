 normal differentiated cells primarily use mitochondrial respiration generate required energy cellular processes, cancer cells rely glycolysis, even sufficient oxygen conditions. phenomenon known "Warburg effect" aerobic glycolysis metabolic reprogramming cancer cells towards altered energy metabolism currently recognized one "hallmarks cancer". Aerobic glycolysis underlies rapid growth tumor cells, high rates glucose consumption lactic acid production, leading cellular acidosis. Metabolic reprogramming renders cancer cells dependent specific metabolic enzymes pathways could exploited cancer therapy. development treatments target tumor glucose metabolism receiving renewed attention, several drugs targeting metabolic pathways currently clinical trials. search suitable targets, however, limited high plasticity metabolic network induce compensatory routes. Deregulated glucose metabolism prominent feature associated resistance classical chemotherapy oncogene-targeted therapies, strengthening clinical potential combining therapies glycolysis inhibitors. aim review compare advances different therapeutic strategies targeting glucose "addiction" tumor cells, highlighting potential effective weapons cancer. discuss recent evidence involvement glucose metabolism compensatory response use drugs target different signaling pathways, combination glycolysis inhibitors could prove extraordinarily useful.
