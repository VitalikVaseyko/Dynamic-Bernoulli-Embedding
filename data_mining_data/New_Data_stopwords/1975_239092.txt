 Enzymes glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylate acid cycle, glyoxylate by-pass fatty-acid biosynthesis assayed extracts Candida 107 grown continuously glucose carbon limitation, nitrogen limitation n-alkanes. yeast therefore either lipogenic lipolytic state. Phosphofructokinase absent conditions whereas enzymes gluconeogenesis, including fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase pentose phosphate cycle, present. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase specific NADP+ inhibited non-competitive manner NADPH NADH. Phosphoenolpyruvate, citrate, ATP acetyl CoA inhibitory effects. Thus glucose metabolism appears pentose phosphate pathway rapidly produce NADPH. readily consumed fatty-acid biosynthesis and, appears inhibition flow carbon glucose acetyl CoA, fatty-acid synthesis continue long supply glucose. results help explain probable causes fat build-up high concentrations (about 40% cell dry weight) organisms. alkane-grown cells, lipogenesis repressed carbon able flow alkanes via acetyl CoA, oxaloacetate pyruvate pentoses hexoses unidirectional manner, strong repression pyruvate kinase increased activities phosphoenolpyruvate kinase fructose 1,6-biosphosphatase conditions. Although little change total activity TCA cycle enzymes various growth conditions, isocitrate lyase induced lipolytic conditions.
