 Tumour cells fulfil bioenergetic biosynthetic needs proliferation using available environmental metabolites. Metabolic adaptation hypoxia causes decreased mitochondrial function increased lactate production. work examines biological importance hypoxia-inducible inhibitory phosphorylations pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit. Pancreatic cancer cell lines genetically manipulated alter net phosphorylation PDH E1alpha reduced kinase expression enhanced phosphatase expression. modified cells tested hypoxic changes phosphorylated E1alpha, mitochondrial metabolism growth xenografted tumours. Even though four PDHK genes, PDHK1 essential inhibitory PDH phosphorylation E1alpha serine 232, partially responsible modification serines 293 300, phosphorylations necessary model tumour growth. order determine clinical relevance, cohort head neck cancer patient biopsies examined phosphorylated E1alpha expression PDHK1. Patients detectable 232 phosphorylation expression PDHK1 tend worse clinical outcome. data show PDHK1 activity unique non-redundant family PHDK enzymes PDHK1 specific inhibitor would therefore anti-cancer activity reduced chance side effects inhibition PDHKs.
