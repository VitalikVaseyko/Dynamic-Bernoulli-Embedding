 reprogramming glucose metabolism oxidative glycolytic metabolism, known Warburg effect, anomalous characteristic cancer cell metabolism. Recent studies revealed subset microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles regulating reprogramming glucose metabolism cancer cells. miRNAs regulate cellular glucose metabolism directly targeting multiple metabolic genes, including encoding key glycolytic enzymes. first part review, summarized recent knowledge miRNA regulation reprogramming glucose metabolism cancer cells discussed potential utilization key miRNA regulators metabolic targets developing new antitumor agents. Then, summarized recent advances methods techniques studying miRNA regulation cancer cell metabolism.
