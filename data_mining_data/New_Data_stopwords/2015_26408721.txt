 BACKGROUND: Aerobic glycolysis important hallmark cancer cells. Deficiency pyruvate dehydrogenase component alpha subunit (PDHE1alpha) leads mitochondrial dysfunction promotes glycolysis. Therefore, studies expression PDHE1alpha cancer warranted. PATIENTS METHODS: PDHE1alpha protein immunohistochemically investigated analyzed 157 samples surgically dissected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 21 'normal' esophageal epithelia tissues. RESULTS: PDHE1alpha protein expression lower ESCC. Absence PDHE1alpha protein expression tumor cells found 77.1% cases. Negativity PDHE1alpha protein tumor cells correlated poor tumor differentiation (p<0.05) shorter overall survival (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Lack PDHE1alpha protein expression ESCC associated poor prognosis. findings also verify existence aerobic glycolysis switch ESCC, strongly advocate novel therapeutic strategies reversing Warburg effect tumors.
