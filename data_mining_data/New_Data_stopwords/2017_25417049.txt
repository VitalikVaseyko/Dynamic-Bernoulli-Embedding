 Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) metabolites environmental pollutants known adverse health effects. 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-benzo-2,5-quinone (4-ClBQ), quinone metabolite 4-monochlorobiphenyl (PCB3, present environment human blood) toxic human skin keratinocytes, breast prostate epithelial cells. study investigates hypothesis 4-ClBQ-induced metabolic oxidative stress regulates toxicity human keratinocytes. Results Seahorse XF96 Analyzer showed 4-ClBQ treatment increased extracellular acidification rate, proton production rate, oxygen consumption rate ATP content, indicative metabolic oxidative stress. Results q-RT-PCR assay showed significant increases mRNA levels hexokinase 2 (hk2), pyruvate kinase M2 (pkm2) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd), decreases mRNA levels succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) subunit C (sdhc sdhd). Pharmacological inhibition G6PD-activity enhanced toxicity 4-ClBQ, suggesting protective function pentose phosphate pathway functional 4-ClBQ-treated cells. decrease sdhc sdhd expression associated significant decrease complex II activity increase mitochondrial levels ROS. Overexpression sdhc sdhd suppressed 4-ClBQ-induced inhibition complex II activity, increase mitochondrial levels ROS, toxicity. results suggest 4-ClBQ treatment induces metabolic oxidative stress HaCaT cells, protective function pentose phosphate pathway active, inhibition complex II activity sensitizes HaCaT cells 4-ClBQ-induced toxicity.
