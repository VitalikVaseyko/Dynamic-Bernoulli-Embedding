 Glucose glutamine abundant nutrients producing energy building blocks normal tumor cells. Increased glycolysis tumors, Warburg Effect, basis (18)F-FDG PET imaging. Cancer cells also genetically reprogrammed use glutamine. 5-(11)C-(2S)-glutamine (18)F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine may useful complementary tools measure changes tumor metabolism. glioma patients, tracer (18)F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine showed tumor-to-background contrast different (18)F-FDG differences uptake glioma patients clinical progression disease versus stable disease (tumor-to-brain ratio > 3.7 clinically active glioma tumors, minimal specific uptake clinically stable tumors). preliminary results suggest (18)F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine PET may new tool probing vivo metabolism glutamine cancer patients guiding glutamine-targeted therapeutics. studies uptake mechanism, comparison kinetics (18)F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine versus (11)C-labeled native glutamine, important enlightening.
