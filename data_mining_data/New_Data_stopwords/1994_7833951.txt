 Two sisters moderately severe Gaucher disease diagnosed usually relatively benign 1226G/1226G genotype examination DNA amplified exon 9, mutation located. discrepancy apparent genotype phenotype, suspected one alleles amplified. Therefore, DNA parents examined. father heterozygous 1226G mutation mother abnormality. shown mother daughters deletion glucocerebrosidase gene: one-half polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification product glucocerebrosidase gene region found, compared internal controls consisting glucocerebrosidase pseudogene adjacent liver pyruvate kinase (PKLR) gene. appearance Southern blots developed full length glucocerebrosidase cDNA probes showed band unique functional glucocerebrosidase gene reduced intensity, abnormal bands present digestion restriction endonuclease, indicating entire coding region deleted.
