 developed uncoupled, pH sensitive kinase assay used high-throughput screening potential inhibitors determining substrate specificity. Kinases catalyze transfer gamma-phosphoryl group ATP appropriate hydroxyl acceptor release proton. assay based detection proton using appropriately matched buffer/indicator system. assay used measure activity four readily available kinases, including hexokinase, glucokinase, glycerokinase, pyruvate kinase, run reverse direction. also went screen small series mono- diphosphonucleotides inhibition hexokinase well modest set potential hexokinase substrates. determined sucrose modest substrate hexokinase K(m) 1.8 +/- 0.2 mM, k(cat) 142 +/- 3 min(-1), V(max) 15% glucose. Given importance kinases diverse array biological functions disease states, need simple, rapid assay system. feel assay lend well meet end. method applicable many enzymatic reactions involve change pH.
