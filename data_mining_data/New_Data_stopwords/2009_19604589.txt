 Tumor cells fuel metabolism glucose glutamine meet bioenergetic biosynthetic demands proliferation. Hypoxia oncogenic mutations drive glycolysis, pyruvate lactate conversion promoted increased expression lactate dehydrogenase inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase. NAD+ pool consecutively regenerated supports high glycolytic flux required produce anabolic intermediates. Glutaminolysis provides metabolic intermediates alpha-ketoglutarate feed thereby maintain tricarboxylic acid cycle biosynthetic hub. Glycolysis glutaminolysis share capacity generate NADPH, pentose phosphate pathway malate conversion pyruvate, respectively. pathways ultimately lead secretion lactate. waste product, lactate recently identified major energy fuel tumors. Lactate produced hypoxic tumor cells may indeed diffuse taken oxygenated tumor cells. Preferential utilization lactate oxidative metabolism spares glucose may turn reach hypoxic tumor cells. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 regulates entry lactate oxidative tumor cells. inhibition favors switch lactate-fuelled respiration glycolysis consecutively kills hypoxic tumor cells glucose starvation. Combination radiotherapy renders remaining cells sensitive irradiation, emphasizing interference tumor cell metabolism may complement current anticancer modalities.
