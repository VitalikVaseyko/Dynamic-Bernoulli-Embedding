 unclear Warburg effect exemplifies enhanced glycolysis cytosol coordinated suppressed mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. demonstrate hypoxia, EGFR activation, expression K-Ras G12V B-Raf V600E induce mitochondrial translocation phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1); mediated ERK-dependent PGK1 S203 phosphorylation subsequent PIN1-mediated cis-trans isomerization. Mitochondrial PGK1 acts protein kinase phosphorylate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1) T338, activates PDHK1 phosphorylate inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. reduces mitochondrial pyruvate utilization, suppresses reactive oxygen species production, increases lactate production, promotes brain tumorigenesis. Furthermore, PGK1 S203 PDHK1 T338 phosphorylation levels correlate PDH S293 inactivating phosphorylation levels poor prognosis glioblastoma patients. work highlights PGK1 acts protein kinase coordinating glycolysis tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, instrumental cancer metabolism tumorigenesis.
