 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells maintain high rates glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK) contribute phenomenon, favours apoptosis resistance cellular transformation. previously reported upregulation PDK4 normal mucosa colorectal cancer (CRC) patients compared controls preneoplastic intestine mouse model. Decreased methylation four consecutive PDK4 CpGs observed normal mucosa patients. Although members PDK family investigated transformation potential, PDK4 extensively studied. METHODS: PDK4 methylation blood CRC patients controls evaluated pyrosequencing. PDK4 expression human colon carcinoma cells down-regulated RNAi. Cellular migration invasion, apoptosis qRT-PCR key genes assessed. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing revealed decreased methylation four consecutive CpGs blood patients compared controls. Cellular migration invasion reduced apoptosis increased following transient stable inhibition PDK4. Expression vimentin, HIF-1 VEGFA reduced. CONCLUSIONS: studies demonstrate involvement PDK4 transformation. Methylation assessment PDK4 blood may useful non-invasive CRC detection. PDK4 considered target development anticancer strategies therapies.
