 UNLABELLED: Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4) mitochondrial metabolic regulators serve decision makers via modulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity convert pyruvate either aerobically acetyl-CoA anaerobically lactate. Metabolic dysregulation inflammatory processes two sides coin several pathophysiological conditions. lactic acid surge associated metabolic shift implicated diverse painful states. study, investigated role PDK-PDH-lactic acid axis pathogenesis chronic inflammatory pain. Deficiency Pdk2 and/or Pdk4 mice attenuated complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced pain hypersensitivities. Likewise, Pdk2/4 deficiency attenuated localized lactic acid surge along hallmarks peripheral central inflammation following intraplantar administration CFA. vitro studies supported role PDK2/4 promoters classical proinflammatory activation macrophages. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition PDKs lactic acid production diminished CFA-induced inflammation pain hypersensitivities. Thus, PDK-PDH-lactic acid axis seems mediate inflammation-driven chronic pain, establishing connection metabolism inflammatory pain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinases (PDKs) substrate PDH orchestrate conversion pyruvate either aerobically acetyl-CoA anaerobically lactate. Lactate, predominant end product glycolysis, recently identified signaling molecule neuron-glia interactions neuronal plasticity. Pathological metabolic shift subsequent lactic acid production thought play important role diverse painful states; however, contribution inflammation-driven pain still comprehended. Here, report PDK-PDH-lactic acid axis constitutes key component inflammatory pain pathogenesis. findings establish unanticipated link metabolism inflammatory pain. study unlocks previously ill-explored research avenue metabolic control inflammatory pain pathogenesis.
