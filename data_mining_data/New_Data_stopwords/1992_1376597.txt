 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) muscle adult parasitic nematode Ascaris suum plays unique role anaerobic mitochondrial metabolism. Resolution intact complex high salt dissociates pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit leaves dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase subunit (E3) two proteins apparent M(r)s 45 43 kDa bound dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) core. proteins observable Coomassie brilliant blue-stained gels eukaryotic PDCs, 45-kDa protein similar apparent M(r), pI, sensitivity trypsin Kb subunit bovine kidney PDH alpha kinase. Acetylation ascarid PDC [2-14C]pyruvate conditions designed maximize incorporation label protein yielded single radiolabeled subunit, E2. results confirm earlier reports ascarid PDC lacks protein X, integral component recently identified eukaryotic PDCs. 1.6 1.8 mol 14C incorporated/mole E2, suggesting ascarid E2 contained two lipoly-bearing domains. Domain mapping 14C-acetylated ascarid E2 limited tryptic digestion identified two lipoyl-bearing fragments apparent M(r)s 50 34 kDa two core fragments apparent M(r)s 46 30 kDa. ascarid E2 domain structure appears similar E2s. However, appears subunit-binding domain (E2B) ascarid E2 may significantly larger flanked larger normal interdomain regions. enlarged E2B domain may necessary accommodate additional binding E3 E2 subunit ascarid complex, absence protein X.
