 Participation formation cystine cysteine 225 cysteine 462 R1 protein enzymatic mechanism aerobic ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase Escherichia coli examined use rapid quenching site-directed immunochemistry. Prereduced ribonucleotide reductase presence ATP mixed CDP quench flow apparatus. reaction terminated solution acetic acid N-ethylmaleimide. protein precipitated digested chymotrypsin proteinase Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 presence N-ethylmaleimide yield peptide SS[S-(N-ethylsuccinimid-2-yl)cysteinyl]VLIE containing cysteine 225 mixed disulfide peptide SSCVLIE peptide IALCTL containing cysteine 462. two peptides retrieved together digest immunoadsorption. affinity-purified peptides modified amino termini fluorescent reagent 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccimidyl carbamate submitted high-pressure liquid chromatography. areas respective peaks fluorescence corresponding S-(N-ethylsuccimidyl) peptide, mixed disulfide used determine percentage cystine formed interval. rate constant formation cystine following association free, fully reduced ribonucleotide reductase reactant CDP 8 s(-)(1). 50% active sites participated pre-steady-state reaction, maximum steady-state rate consistent involvement cystine enzymatic reaction would 4 s(-1). Since turnover number enzyme conditions steady state assay 1 s(-)(1), formation cystine two cysteines kinetically competent.
