 INTRODUCTION: Coverslip hypoxia (CSH) recently described method producing rapid severe ischemia derived metabolic activity synchronously contracting isolated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). effect acute ischemia produced CSH documented, contribution reperfusion cell viability fully studied. METHODS: therefore used fluorescence microscopy expression profiling microarray determine morphological genetic effects NRVMs ischemic reperfusion events CSH. RESULTS: Fluorescence microscopy studies coverslipped NRVMs showed cell death 1 h previously reported. Matched samples coverslipped 2 h reperfused 18 h showed myocyte recovery prior beyond 1 h upon post-staining, suggesting limited window recovery. Expression profiling 30,000 genes using total RNA collected NRVMs subjected varying periods ischemia reperfusion revealed 103 genes regulated least 2-fold p<10(-7). genes fall discrete functional groups including apoptosis, metabolism, hypoxia/acidosis. regulation subset genes groups confirmed RT-PCR. Interestingly, hypoxia/acidosis gene BNip3 (a Bcl-2 family member implicated hypoxia/acidosis-associated cell death) upregulated early ischemia persisted throughout reperfusion. addition, hypoxia/acidosis genes heme oxygenase 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, prolyl hydroxylases, hypoxia-inducible protein 2 upregulated. DISCUSSION: data suggest ischemic reperfusion events created CSH induce gene regulation within distinct functional groups related vivo ischemia.
