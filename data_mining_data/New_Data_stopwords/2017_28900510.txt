 Ferroptosis newly discovered form non-apoptotic cell death multiple human diseases. However, epigenetic mechanisms underlying ferroptosis remain poorly defined. First, demonstrated lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH), DNA methylation modifier, interacted WDR76 inhibit ferroptosis activating lipid metabolism-associated genes, including GLUT1, ferroptosis related genes SCD1 FADS2, turn, involved Warburg effect. WDR76 targeted genes expression dependent manner LSH chromatin modification DNA methylation histone modification. effects dependent iron lipid reactive oxygen species. demonstrated EGLN1 c-Myc directly activated expression LSH inhibiting HIF-1alpha. Finally, demonstrated LSH functioned oncogene lung cancer vitro vivo. Therefore, study elucidates molecular basis c-Myc/EGLN1-mediated induction LSH expression inhibits ferroptosis, exploited development therapeutic strategies targeting ferroptosis treatment cancer.
