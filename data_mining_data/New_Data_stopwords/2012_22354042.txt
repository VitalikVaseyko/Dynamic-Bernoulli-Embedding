 Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis. phenomenon, known Warburg effect, anomalous characteristic glucose metabolism cancer cells. Chronic inflammation key promoting factor tumourigenesis. remains, however, largely unexplored whether pro-tumourigenic inflammation regulates glucose metabolism cancer cells. Here, show pro-inflammatory cytokines promote glycolysis breast cancer cells, inflammation-induced miR-155 functions important mediator process. show miR-155 acts upregulate hexokinase 2 (hk2), two distinct mechanisms. First, miR-155 promotes hk2 transcription activation signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3), transcriptional activator hk2. Second, via targeting C/EBPbeta (a transcriptional activator mir-143), miR-155 represses mir-143, negative regulator hk2, thus resulting upregulation hk2 expression post-transcriptional level. miR-155-mediated hk2 upregulation also appears operate types cancer cells examined. suggest miR-155/miR-143/HK2 axis may represent common mechanism linking inflammation altered metabolism cancer cells.
