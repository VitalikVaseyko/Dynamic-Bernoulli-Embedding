 Brisk fatty acid (FA) production cancer cells accommodated Warburg effect. breast cancer cell types addicted fatty acids (FA), require membrane phospholipid synthesis, signaling purposes, energy production. Expression enzymes required FA synthesis closely linked major classes signaling molecules stimulate BC cell proliferation. review focuses regulation FA synthesis BC cells, impact FA, lack thereof, tumor cell phenotype. Given growing awareness impact dietary fat obesity BC biology, also examine less-frequently considered notion that, addition de novo FA synthesis, lipolytic uptake preformed FA may also important mechanism lipid acquisition. Indeed, appears cancer cells may exist different points along "lipogenic-lipolytic axis," FA uptake could thwart attempts exploit strict requirement FA focused solely inhibition de novo FA synthesis. Strategies clinically targeting FA metabolism discussed, current status medicinal chemistry area assessed. J. Cell. Physiol. 231: 2128-2141, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
