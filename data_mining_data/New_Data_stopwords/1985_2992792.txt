 postnatal development, 0 90 days, three hindlimb muscles diaphragm rat investigated respect fiber types diameter (histochemistry) substrate oxidation rates enzyme activities (biochemistry). process muscle fiber differentiation mature patterns evaluated visual classification 3 4 groups different staining intensities 3 enzyme-histochemical reactions, enabling 26 fiber types distinguished. exhibited specific sizes growth rates varied among muscles. One hindleg muscles (flexor digitorum brevis) remained much immature soleus extensor digitorum longus. histochemical biochemical findings correlated well. capacity pyruvate palmitate oxidation, activities cytochrome c oxidase citrate synthase, increased markedly 9 37 days soleus extensor digitorum longus (except citrate synthase latter) flexor digitorum brevis. Creatine kinase activity increased hindlimb muscles. capacity activity pyruvate oxidation (determined homogenates intact isolated muscles, respectively), accordance fiber type composition. contrast oxidation capacity, activity pyruvate oxidation decreased birth mature stage, value 18-42% early postnatal muscles recorded.
