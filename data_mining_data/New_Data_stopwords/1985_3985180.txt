 mitochondrial model gluconeogenesis tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyruvate metabolized via pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase examined. effect rate tricarboxylic acid flux rates three reactions pyruvate metabolism labeling patterns [14C]pyruvate [24C]acetate analyzed. Expressions describing specific radioactivities 14C distribution glucose function rates derived. Specific radioactivities isotopic patterns depend markedly ratio rates pyruvate carboxylation decarboxylation rate citrate synthesis, effect phosphoenolpyruvate hydrolysis minor. effects rates 1) specific radioactivity phosphoenolpyruvate, 2) labeling pattern glucose, 3) contribution pyruvate, acetyl-coenzyme A, CO2 glucose carbon illustrated. determine contribution lactate alanine gluconeogenesis, experiments two compounds labeled different carbons required. Methods current use correct dilution 14C gluconeogenesis [14C]pyruvate shown erroneous. experimental design techniques determine gluconeogenesis 14C-labeled precursors presented illustrated numerical examples.
