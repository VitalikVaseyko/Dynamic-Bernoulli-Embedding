 Activities (mumol X min-1 X g liver) zonal distributions key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism studied livers streptozotocin-diabetic rats compared values alloxan-diabetes. Streptozotocin led non-ketotic diabetes blood glucose increased fivefold ketone bodies normal range, alloxan produced ketotic diabetes blood glucose, acetoacetate beta-hydroxybutyrate elevated fivefold. Portal insulin decreased 20% streptozotocin- drastically 7% alloxan-diabetes. Conversely, portal glucagon increased two states 250% 180%, respectively. glucogenic key enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) enhanced streptozotocin- alloxan-diabetes 300%, glycolytic pyruvate kinase L (PKL) lowered 65% 80%, respectively. normal periportal perivenous gradient PEPCK 3:1, measured microdissected tissue samples, maintained elevated activities two zones. normal periportal perivenous gradient PKL 1:1.7 diminished lowered activities two zones. glucogenic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) increased streptozotocin- alloxan-diabetes 130% 140%, respectively, glucose utilizing glucokinase (GK) decreased 60% 50%, respectively. normal periportal perivenous gradient G6Pase, demonstrated histochemically, remained unaffected. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) increased 190% acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) decreased 60% streptozotocin, non-ketotic diabetes, two enzymes altered drastically 400% 50%, respectively, alloxan, ketotic diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
