 OBJECTIVE: Recent studies identified accumulation reactive oxygen species (ROS) common pathway causing insulin resistance. However, whether reduction ROS levels improves insulin resistance remains elucidated. present study designed define mechanism. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: investigated effect overexpression superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 liver obese diabetic model (db/db) mice adenoviral injection. RESULTS: db/db mice high ROS levels liver. Overexpression SOD1 liver db/db mice reduced hepatic ROS blood glucose level. changes accompanied improvement insulin resistance reduction hepatic gene expression phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), main regulator gluconeogenic genes. inhibition hepatic insulin resistance accompanied attenuation phosphorylation cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), main regulator PGC-1alpha expression, attenuation Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation. Simultaneously, overexpression SOD1 db/db mice enhanced inactivation forkhead box class O1, another regulator PGC-1alpha expression, without changes insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation liver. hepatocyte cell lines, ROS induced phosphorylation JNK CREB, latter, together PGC-1alpha expression, inhibited JNK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: results indicate reduction ROS potential therapeutic target liver insulin resistance, least partly reduced expression PGC-1alpha.
