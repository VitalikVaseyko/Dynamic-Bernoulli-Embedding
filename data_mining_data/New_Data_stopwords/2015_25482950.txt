 Deregulated metabolism gaining recognition hallmark cancer cells, explored therapeutic potential. Warburg effect metabolic phenotype occurs 90% tumors, glycolysis favored despite presence oxygen. Dichloroacetate (DCA) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor reverse Warburg effect. PENAO (4-(N-(S-penicillaminylacetyl)amino) phenylarsonous acid) novel anti-mitochondrial agent targets adenine nucleotide transporter mitochondria currently clinical trials solid tumors. investigated targeting two aspects metabolism, using DCA promote mitochondrial activity combined PENAO inhibit mitochondrial activity, breast carcinoma cell lines. PENAO effective low uM concentrations luminal (T-47D) triple negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells, normoxia hypoxia. cytotoxicity PENAO enhanced DCA mechanism involving increased reactive oxygen species T-47D MDA-MB-231 cells, however investigations found always involve PDK2 inhibition reduction mitochondrial membrane potential, accepted mechanisms DCA induction apoptosis. Nevertheless, DCA sensitized cancer cell lines tested toward apoptosis PENAO. DCA PENAO currently clinical trials targeting cancer metabolism drugs may offer options difficult treat cancers.
