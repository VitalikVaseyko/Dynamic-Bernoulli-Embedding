 Parenchymal non-parenchymal cells isolated adult rat liver fully regenerated 70% partial hepatectomy. characteristics parenchymal cell preparations regenerated rat liver indicated homogeneous population comparable parenchymal cells isolated intact liver. parenchymal cells regenerated adult rat liver contain glucokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase type aldolase B. non-parenchymal cells contain hexokinase, pyruvate kinase type III aldolase B. cells isolated different times day rats controlled feeding schedules, variation tyrosine aminotransferase activity liver glycogen content observed parenchymal cells keeping reported diurnal oscillations found whole liver extracts. parenchymal cells isolated rats 48 72h partial hepatectomy, different isoenzyme patterns observed. cells appeared synthesize pyruvate kinase type III, function assigned previously non-parenchymal cells foetal rat liver hepatocytes.
