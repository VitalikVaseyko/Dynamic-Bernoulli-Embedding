 central circadian clock within suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) plays important role temporally organizing coordinating many processes governing cancer cell proliferation tumor growth synchrony daily light/dark cycle may contribute endogenous cancer prevention. Bioenergetic substrates molecular intermediates required building tumor biomass day derived aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) lipid metabolism. Using tissue-isolated human breast cancer xenografts grown nude rats, determined circulating systemic factors host Warburg effect, linoleic acid uptake/metabolism growth signaling activities tumor dynamically regulated, coordinated integrated within circadian time structure 24-hour light/dark cycle SCN-driven nocturnal pineal production anticancer hormone melatonin. Dim light night (LAN)-induced melatonin suppression disrupts circadian-regulated host/cancer balance among several important cancer preventative signaling mechanisms, leading hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia host runaway aerobic glycolysis, lipid signaling proliferative activity tumor.
