 Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) classic persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Many studies found positive association progression hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) PCBs exposure. However, influence PCBs epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) HCC remains unclear. study, explored effect PCB126 EMT HCC cells underlying mechanisms. data showed PCB126, exposing Bel-7402 SMMC-7721 cells 48h, promoted EMT demonstrated E-cadherin repression, up-regulation N-cadherin vimentin, morphological alteration. found signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3)/Snail1 signaling activated PCB126 exposure, addition STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 blocked PCB126-induced down-regulation E-cadherin well up-regulation N-cadherin vimentin. Moreover, PCB126 exposure increased pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression nuclear translocation, whereas treatment PKM2 shRNA suppressed activation STAT3/Snail1 signaling alternation EMT-related molecules (E-cadherin, N-cadherin vimentin). Furthermore, study indicated estrogen receptor (ER) aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) involved PCB126-induced effects PKM2, STAT3/Snail1 signaling EMT according treatment using ER inhibitor ICI AhR shRNA. Notably, PCB126-increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via AhR associated activation PKM2/STAT3/Snail1 cascades contributes EMT. Taken together, results indicated PCB126 promotes EMT process HCC cells via PKM2/STAT3/Snail1 signaling mediated ER AhR.
