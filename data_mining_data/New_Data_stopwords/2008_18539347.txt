 Genome analysis glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway Wolbachia endosymbiont filarial parasite Brugia malayi (wBm) revealed wBm lacks pyruvate kinase (PK) may instead utilize enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK; ATP:pyruvate, orthophosphate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.9.1). PPDK catalyses reversible conversion AMP, PPi phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ATP, Pi pyruvate. glycolytic pathway organisms, including mammals, contains exclusively PK production pyruvate PEP. Therefore, absence PPDK mammals makes enzyme attractive Wolbachia drug target. present study, cloned expressed active wBm-PPDK, thereby providing insight energy metabolism endosymbiont. results support development wBm-PPDK promising new drug target anti-symbiotic approach controlling filarial infection.
