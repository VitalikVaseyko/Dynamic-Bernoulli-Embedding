 paper presents certain simple procedures assessing common types interference, due haemolysis, icterus lipaemic serum 19 routine Clinical Chemistry tests suggests steps overcome problem tests. change measured concentration, analytically significant, exceed 2.8 X % coefficient variation (cv) intra-assay analytical variation assay. Haemolysis caused interference 10 19 assays investigated. haemolysate haemoglobin concentration 0.29 g/dl, visible eye, caused analytically significant increase creatinine kinase MB subunit (CKMB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, triglyceride, uric acid urea, significant decrease alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin. higher concentration haemoglobin (0.68 g/ dl) caused additional significant increase CK, decrease direct bilirubin. Addition bilirubin caused interference peroxidase linked reactions well creatinine assay. serum concentration 5.2 mg/dl caused decrease creatinine, glucose, triglyceride uric acid. higher concentration (15.9 mg/dl) also decreased cholesterol. Lipaemia interference affected least number assays. added triglyceride 537-561 mg/dl caused increase glucose, uric acid, amylase. level 1122 mg/dl also increased CKMB, value 2244 mg/dl increased total direct bilirubin. highest levels haemolysis lipaemia, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) giutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) gave erratic results. Overall uric acid CKMB analytes susceptible interference, serum caicium phosphate suffer any. interference depends exact assay conditions used susceptibility individual laboratory's tests determined them. reasons interferences described discussed.
