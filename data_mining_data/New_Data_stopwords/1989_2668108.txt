 pyruvate kinase Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes activated fructose 2,6-diphosphate ((A) 0.5 = 0.17 microM), decrease (S) 0.5 increase Vmax substrates. enzyme 50% inhibited 0.9 mM ATP 0.5 mM Pi presence 30 mM MgCl2; inhibitions completely counteracted 1.5 microM fructose 2,6-diphosphate. facts suggest effects allosteric, due chelation.
