 Glucagon (0.04-0.09 mg/kg/min) given intravenously either 2 3 min eight patients fasting-induced hypoglycemia. One child hepatic phosphorylase deficiency, two children glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency, two children debrancher enzyme (amylo-1,6-glucosidase) deficiency, two children one adult decreased hepatic fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase) activity. Liver biopsy specimens obtained immediately glucagon infusion. glucagon caused significant increase activity FDPase (from 50+/-10.0 72+/-11.7 nmol/mg protein/min) significant decrease activities phosphofructokinase (PFK) (from 92+/-6.1 41+/-8.1 nmol/mg protein/min) pyruvate kinase (PK) (from 309+/-39.4 165+/-23.9 nmol/mg protein/min). glucagon infusion also caused significant increase hepatic cyclic AMP concentrations (from 41+/-2.6 233+/-35.6 pmol/mg protein). Two patients debrancher enzyme deficiency biopsy specimens taken 5 min glucagon infusion persistence enzyme cyclic AMP changes least 5 min. One child glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency given intravenous glucose (150 mg/kg/min) period 5 min glucagon infusion biopsy. plasma insulin concentration increased 8 152 muU/ml blood glucose increased 72 204 mg/100 ml. third liver biopsy specimen obtained immediately glucose infusion showed glucagon-induced effects PFK FDPase completely reversed. glucagon infusion caused increase hepatic cyclic AMP concentration 38 431 pmol/mg protein glucose infusion caused slight decrease hepatic cyclic AMP concentration (from 431 384 pmol/mg protein), appear sufficient account changes enzyme activities. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase activities altered either glucagon glucose infusion patients. Cyclic AMP (0.05 mmol/kg) injected portal vein adult rats caused enzyme changes similar seen glucagon administration humans. findings suggest rapid changes activities PFK, PK, FDPase important regulation hepatic glycolysis gluconeogenesis, respectively, humans cyclic AMP may mediate glucagon- probably glucose-insulin-induced changes enzyme activities.
