 shown experiments vivo development experimental metabolic alkalosis rats followed changes redox processes eye retina tunic. first two months experiment number sulphydryl group decreases, disulphide ones water-soluble proteins low-molecular compounds increases. amount oxidized metabolites glycolysis cycle tricarboxylic acids (pyruvate, oxaloacetate, alpha-ketoglutarate) increases relative reduced ones (lactate, isocitrate, malate), well activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase, activities fructose diphosphatase, glucoso-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase glutathione reductase fall. content malonic dialdehyde increases. 90 days later disorders certain compensatory mechanisms metabolic system alkalosis regulation probably occurred eye retina tunic tissues: hexokinase pyruvate kinase activity fell control values, NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase--below control level; content lactate increased. Activity glutathione-dependent enzymes remained low amount malonic dialdehyde grew much previous terms.
