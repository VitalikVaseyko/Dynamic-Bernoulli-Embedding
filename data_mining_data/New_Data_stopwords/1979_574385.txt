 Metabolic enzymic changes measured meal-trained rats fed high-carbohydrate diet. Rates hepatic fatty acid synthesis probably greater rates gluconeogenesis throughout 24 h day provided animals fed. daily enhancement fatty acid synthesis meal feeding coincided maximum activation hepatic pyruvate kinase. Maximum activation enzyme reflected increased total catalytic activity (Vmax.), increased activity 0.5 MM-phosphoenolpyruvate (V0.5), decreased Vmax./V0.5 ratio decrease co-operativity phosphoenolpyruvate binding measured Hill coefficient (h). latter changes consistent decrease enzyme phosphorylation activation enzyme. estimate changes enzyme protein, quantitative enzyme precipitation rabbit antisera used. Giving high-carbohydrate diet meal-trained animals induced enzyme synthesis within hours. Adaptations diet enhanced fatty acid synthesis (chow high carbohydrate; starved high carbohydrate) led increased steady-state concentration pyruvate kinase protein. approximate estimate half-life hepatic pyruvate kinase 56 h. Whenever pyruvate kinase specific activity measured liver tissue extracts always considerably less (20--100 mumol/min per mg protein, depending dietary status) specific activity pure pyruvate kinase (200 mumol/min per mg protein). Antigenically active, catalytically inactive protein removed enzyme purification cytosol stage (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. fraction precipitated 30--45%-satd. (NH4)2SO4 enzymically active, antigenically reacting protein identified remaining (NH4)2SO4 fractions (0--30%- 45--85%-satd.) contained enzyme activity. may correspond inactive proteolytic fragments pyruvate kinase. rate-determining step adjusting enzyme concentration seems proteolysis.
