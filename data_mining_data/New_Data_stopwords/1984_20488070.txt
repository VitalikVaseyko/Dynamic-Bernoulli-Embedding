 Neuroblastoma cells, cultivated plastic dishes, presence 15 mM glucose resist well hypoxia. Cells incubated plastic dishes, left unshaken, showed Pasteur effect oxygen concentration 10%. Oxygen diffusion limiting factor plastic dishes since improved oxygen diffusion, result shaking, decreased lactate production considerably oxygen concentrations used. cells cultivated Petriperm((R)) dishes, coated polylysine, oxygen diffusion longer rate-limiting factor: less lactate produced 21% O(2) hypoxia, 2.5% O(2) show increase rate lactate production, Antimycin drastically increased glycolytic rate. situation limited oxygen availability resulted two different kinds adaptation neuroblastoma cells: first instantaneous metabolic regulation leading increased glycolytic rate-the Pasteur effect-followed later increase activities glycolytic enzymes-hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) simultaneous decrease mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) activity. However, glucose concentration medium decreased 5 mM cells affected hypoxia already 5% O(2): cells released lactate dehydrogenase extracellularly protein content decreased. toxic effect hypoxia related exhaustion glucose supply.
