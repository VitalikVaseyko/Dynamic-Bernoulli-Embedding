Several mechanisms, may different different cell lines, seem involved characteristic energy metabolism tumor cell. Changes cell membrane leading increased uptake utilization glucose, high level fetal types isoenzymes, decreased number mitochondria reduced capacity metabolize pyruvate factors must taken consideration. possible favour one present time.
