 Understanding perform enzyme assay critical learning skill undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. Students biochemistry typically exposed use NMR spectroscopy tool determine chemical structure, rarely exposed utility NMR evaluate enzyme kinetics. Furthermore, coverage NMR experiments utilizing "alternative nuclei", (15) N, (19) F, (31) P may neglected. Herein report simple (31) P NMR tube experiment allows students examine enzyme kinetics equilibrium constant reaction catalyzed pyruvate kinase.
