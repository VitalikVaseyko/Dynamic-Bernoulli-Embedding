 common feature tumors arising diverse tissue types reliance aerobic glycolysis glucose metabolism. metabolic difference cancer cells normal cells could exploited therapeutic benefit patients. Cancer cells universally express M2 isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2), previous work demonstrated PKM2 expression necessary aerobic glycolysis cell proliferation vivo. normal tissues express isoform pyruvate kinase PKM2, selective targeting PKM2 provides opportunity target cell metabolism cancer therapy. PKM2 identical catalytic site related M1 splice variant (PKM1). However, isoform selective inhibition possible PKM2 contains unique region allosteric regulation. screened library greater 1,00,000 small molecules identify inhibitors. inhibitors identified PKM2 fell primarily three distinct structural classes. potent PKM2 inhibitor resulted decreased glycolysis increased cell death following loss growth factor signaling. least part effect due on-target PKM2 inhibition less cell death observed cells engineered express PKM1. data suggest isoform selective inhibition PKM2 small molecules feasible support hypothesis inhibition glucose metabolism cancer cells viable strategy treat human malignancy.
