 Reaction rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase affinity label 5'-[p-(fluorosulfonyl) benzoyl] guanosine (5'-FSBG), pH 7.65 7.93, leads loss enzyme activity. inactivation characterized biphasic kinetic profile, initial phase accounting approximately 55% reduction enzymatic activity. rapid slow phases, pH 7.93, inactivation rate constants linearly proportional reagent concentration (from 0.48 3.0 mM), yielding second-order rate constants 195 min-1 M-1 19 min-1 m-1, respectively. effect ligands tested two phases inactivation. both, decrease inactivation rate produced Mg2+ alone, best protection provided Mg2+ plus either ADP GDP, suggesting reaction occurs region metal-nucleotide binding site. Modified pyruvate kinase completely reactivated incubation 20 mM dithiothreitol, indicating involvement cysteine inactivation, indicating involvement cysteine inactivation process. Reaction [5'=3H]-5'-FSBG leads incorporation 1.3 mol radioactive reagent per mol enzyme subunit; however, identical radiolabel incorporation observed dithiothreitol reactivation modified enzyme. result implies labeled amino acid residue, measured means incorporation, directly involved inactivation process. contrast, inactivation found correlate well loss two free sulfhydryl groups per enzyme subunit restoration activity correlate regeneration two free sulfhydryls treatment modified enzyme dithiothreitol. proposed inactivation pyruvate kinase 5'-FSBG proceeds formation thiol sulfonate followed rapid displacement sulfinic acid moiety second cysteine yield disulfide. negative cooperatively interaction pyruvate kinase subunits 5'-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)-benzoyl] guanosine might best account biphasic inactivation kinetics.
