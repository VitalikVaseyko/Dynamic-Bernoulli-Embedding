 UNLABELLED: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) rare segmental premature aging disorder recapitulates biological physical aspects physiological aging. disease caused sporadic dominant mutation LMNA gene leads expression progerin, mutant form lamin lacks 50 amino acids retains toxic farnesyl modification carboxy-terminus. However, mechanisms underlying cellular damage senescence accelerated aging HGPS incompletely understood. Here, analyzed fibroblasts healthy subjects HGPS patients using SILAC (stable isotope labeling amino acids cell culture). found HGPS cells marked downregulation mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins accompanied mitochondrial dysfunction, process thought provoke broad organ decline normal aging. also found mitochondrial dysfunction fibroblasts adult progeroid mice expressing progerin (Lmna(G609G/G609G) knock-in mice) prelamin (Zmpste24-null mice). Analysis tissues mouse models revealed damaging effect proteins mitochondrial function time- dose-dependent. Mitochondrial alterations observed brain, tissue extremely low progerin expression seems unaffected HGPS. Remarkably, mitochondrial function restored progeroid mouse fibroblasts treated isoprenylation inhibitors FTI-277 pravastatin plus zoledronate, tested HGPS clinical trials. results suggest mitochondrial dysfunction contributes premature organ decline aging HGPS. Beyond effects progeria, prelamin progerin may also contribute mitochondrial dysfunction organ damage normal aging, since proteins expressed cells tissues non-HGPS individuals, prominently advanced ages. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Mutations LMNA defective processing prelamin causes premature aging disorders, including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS patients carry heterozygosis de-novo point mutation (c.1824C>T: GGC>GGT; p.G608G) causes expression lamin mutant protein called progerin. Despite importance progerin prelamin accelerated aging, underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. tackle question, compared proteome skin-derived dermal fibroblast HGPS patients age-matched controls using quantitative stable isotope labeling amino acids cell culture (SILAC). results show pronounced down-regulation several components mitochondrial ATPase complex accompanied up-regulation glycolytic enzymes. Accordingly, functional studies demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction HGPS fibroblasts. Moreover, expression functional studies using cellular animal models confirmed mitochondrial dysfunction feature progeria develops time- dose-dependent manner. Finally, demonstrate improved mitochondrial function progeroid mouse cells treated combination statins aminobisphosphonates, two drugs evaluated ongoing HGPS clinical trials. Although studies needed unravel mechanisms progerin prelamin provoke mitochondrial abnormalities, findings may pave way improved treatments HGPS. studies may also improve knowledge mechanisms leading mitochondrial dysfunction normal aging, since progerin prelamin found accumulate normal aging.
