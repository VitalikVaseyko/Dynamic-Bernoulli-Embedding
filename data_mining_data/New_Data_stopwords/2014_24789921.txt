 Obesity major public health problem, predisposing subjects metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases. Specific prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) regulate stability hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), potent governor metabolism, isoenzyme 2 main regulator. investigated whether HIF-P4H-2 inhibition could used treat obesity consequences. Hif-p4h-2-deficient mice, whether fed normal chow high-fat diet, less adipose tissue, smaller adipocytes, less adipose tissue inflammation littermates. also improved glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, mRNA levels HIF-1 targets glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 increased tissues, whereas acetyl-CoA concentration decreased. hepatic mRNA level HIF-2 target insulin receptor substrate-2 higher, whereas two key enzymes fatty acid synthesis lower. Serum cholesterol levels de novo lipid synthesis decreased, mice protected hepatic steatosis. Oral administration HIF-P4H inhibitor, FG-4497, wild-type mice metabolic dysfunction phenocopied beneficial effects. HIF-P4H-2 inhibition may novel therapy protects development obesity consequences also reverses conditions.
