 influence starvation renal carbohydrate metabolism studied proximal distal fragments nephron. Starvation induced double opposite adaptation mechanism fractions renal tubule. renal proximal tubules, gluconeogenic flux stimulated progressively period 48 hours starvation (2.15 fold), due, part, significant increase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities although different characteristics. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity tubular fragment increased subsaturating subtrate concentration (68%) involved significant decrease Km (35%) fructose 1,6-bisphosphate change Vmax. behaviour clearly indicates related modifications activity preexistent enzyme cell. Proximal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity increased proportionally substrate concentrations (86 89% respectively) brought changes Vmax without changes Km, accordance variations cellular levels enzyme. renal distal tubules, glycolytic capacity drastically decreased throughout starvation time. 48 hours 65% inhibition shown. found short term regulation phosphofructokinase activity starvation involves increase Km (2.2 fold) without changes Vmax, result kinetic changes, inactivation phosphofructokinase detected subsaturating concentration fructose 6-phosphate. contrary, nutritional state modify kinetic behaviour renal pyruvate kinase. Finally, neither proximal glycolytic distal gluconeogenic capacities related enzymes activities changed starvation.
