 molecular architecture rabbit skeletal muscle aldolase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase, EC 4.1.2.13) tetramer determined 2.7-A resolution. Solution three-dimensional structure rabbit muscle aldolase utilized phase information single isomorphous Pt(CN)4(2-) derivative, combined iterative-phase refinement based upon noncrystallographic 222-fold symmetry exhibited tetramer subunits. electron-density map calculated refined phases (mf = 0.72) interpreted basis known amino acid sequence (363 amino acids per subunit). molecular architecture aldolase subunit corresponds singly wound beta-barrel parallel alpha/beta class structures observed triose phosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase, phosphogluconate aldolase, well others. Close contacts tetramer subunits virtually regions hydrophobic residues. Contrary beta-barrel structures, known active-site residues located center beta-barrel accessible substrate COOH side beta-barrel. Biochemical crystallographic data suggest COOH-terminal region aldolase covers active-site pocket COOH side beta-barrel mediates access active site. basis sequence studies, active-site residues well residues lining active-site pocket totally conserved throughout evolution. comparison, homology COOH-terminal region minimal. suggested amino acid sequence COOH-terminal region may be, part, basis variable specific activities aldolases exhibit toward substrates.
