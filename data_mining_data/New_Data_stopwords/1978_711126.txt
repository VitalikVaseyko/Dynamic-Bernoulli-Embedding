 Untrained healthy male volunteers studied observe effects physical exercise (bicycle ergometer, 920 kpm/min 10 min, 15 min 30 min) upon glycolytic intermediates red blood cells. levels glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, pyruvate lactate increased exercise. levels fructose 1,6-diphosphate increased phosphoenolpyruvate decreased respectively 30 min exercise. rest period 30 min 30 min exercise lactate level still remained unchanged, however intermediates returned preexercise values. negative crossover point seemed exist fructose 6-phosphate fructose 1, 6-diphosphate 15 min exercise. positive crossover point observed phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate 30 min exercise. significant increases hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities, phosphofructokinase activity 30 min exercise. facts suggested increase pyruvate kinase activity due elevated fructose 1,6-diphosphate level 30 min exercise. significant increase plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity found exercise. close positive correlation observed pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate ratio dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity 30 min exercise. suggested pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate ratio provided reliable index physical exercise.
