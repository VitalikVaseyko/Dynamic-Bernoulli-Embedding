 1. Chlorella pyrenoidosa grown continuous-culture apparatus various light intensities provided incandescent lamps, conditions culture maintained constant. Light intensity curves cells immersed No. 11 Warburg buffer Knop's solution + 4.4 per cent CO(2) saturating light intensity determined characteristics photosynthetic mechanism. characteristics referred centrifuged cell volume index quantity cellular material. 2. Cells grown intensities range 35 f.-c. develop capacity high rate photosynthesis (c.mm. O(2)/hour/c.mm. cells). culture intensities range cells produced lower capacity photosynthesis. similar effect observed rate photosynthesis per unit dry weight rate per unit cell nitrogen. 3. rate photosynthesis per cell rate per unit chlorophyll shows maximum light intensity culture increases continuously throughout range light intensities studied. 4. Maximum rate growth attained light intensity 100 f.-c. hypothesis advanced culture intensities needed give maximum rate growth (100 f.-c.) mechanism developed opposes photosynthetic process removes photosynthetic products. 5. low capacity photosynthesis shown cells grown culture intensities 35 f.-c. finds immediate explanation. 6. shape light intensity curve markedly affected light intensity cells cultured. Cells grown lower intensities give light intensity curves approaching Blackman type short transitional region light limitation light saturation.
