 Cancer cells, use glucose normal cells accumulate extracellular lactate even normoxic conditions (Warburg effect), reported undergo cell death glucose deprivation, whereas normal cells remain viable. may relevant exploit molecular mechanisms underlying biological response achieve new cancer therapies, paper sought identify using transcriptome proteome analysis applied established glucose-addicted cellular model transformation, namely, murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts harboring oncogenic K-RAS gene, compared parental cells. Noteworthy analyses performed high- low-glucose cultures indicate reduction glucose availability induces, especially transformed cells, significant increase expression several unfolded protein response (UPR) hallmark genes. show response strictly associated transformed cell death, given attenuation, reducing protein translation increasing cell protein folding capacity, preserves survival transformed cells. effect also observed inhibiting c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, pro-apoptotic signaling mediator set downstream UPR. Strikingly, addition N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, specific substrate hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), glucose-depleted cells completely prevents transformed cell death, stressing important role glucose HBP fuelling ensure UPR attenuation increased cell survival. Interestingly, results fully recognized human model breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 cells. conclusion, show glucose deprivation, leading harmful accumulation unfolded proteins consequence reduction protein glycosylation, induces UPR-dependent cell death mechanism. findings may open way new therapeutic strategies specifically kill glycolytic cancer cells.
