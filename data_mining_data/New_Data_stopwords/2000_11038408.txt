 Glycolytic fibres rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) tibialis anterior (TA) selectively activated, demonstrated glycogen depletion, indirect electrical stimulation via electrodes implanted vicinity peroneal nerve using high frequency (40 Hz) trains (250 ms 1 Hz) low voltage (threshold palpable contractions). regime applied 10 times per day, bout 15 min duration 60 min recovery, 2 weeks. Cryostat sections muscles stained alkaline phosphatase depict capillaries, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) demonstrate oxidative fibres, periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS) verify glycogen depletion. Specific activity hexokinase (HK), 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glycogen phosphorylase cytochrome c oxidase (COX) estimated separately homogenates EDL predominantly glycolytic cortex oxidative core TA. Stimulation increased activity HK oxidative enzymes fast muscles. Comparison changes oxidative capacity capillary supply showed dissociation predominantly glycolytic TA cortex. Here, COX 3.9+/-0.68 microM min(-1) (g wet wt)-1 stimulated muscles compared 3.7+/-0.52 microM min(-1) (g wet wt)-1 contralateral muscles (difference significant), percentage oxidative fibres (those positively stained SDH) also similar stimulated (14.0+/-2.8 %) contralateral (12.2 +/-1.9 %) muscles. contrast, capillary fibre ratio significantly increased (2.01+/-0.12 vs. 1.55+/-0.04, P<0.01). conclude capillary supply increased independently oxidative capacity, possibly due haemodynamic factors, serves metabolite removal greater extent substrate delivery.
