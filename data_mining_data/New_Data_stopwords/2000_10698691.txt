 Using immunoblot analysis antibodies raised recombinant pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoenzymes PDK2 PDK4, demonstrate selective changes PDK isoenzyme expression slow-twitch versus fast-twitch skeletal muscle types response prolonged (48 h) starvation refeeding starvation. Starvation increased PDK activity slow-twitch (soleus) fast-twitch (anterior tibialis) skeletal muscle associated loss sensitivity PDK inhibition pyruvate, greater effect anterior tibialis. Starvation significantly increased PDK4 protein expression soleus anterior tibialis, greater response anterior tibialis. Starvation effect PDK2 protein expression soleus, modestly increased PDK2 expression anterior tibialis. Refeeding 4 h partially reversed effect 48-h starvation PDK activity PDK4 expression soleus anterior tibialis, response marked soleus anterior tibialis. Pyruvate sensitivity PDK activity also partially restored refeeding, greater response soleus. concluded targeted regulation PDK4 isoenzyme expression skeletal muscle response starvation refeeding underlies modulation regulatory characteristics PDK vivo. propose switching pyruvate-sensitive pyruvate-insensitive PDK isoenzyme starvation (a) maintains sufficiently high pyruvate concentration ensure glucose-->alanine-->glucose cycle impaired, (b) may 'spare' pyruvate anaplerotic entry tricarboxylic acid cycle support entry acetyl-CoA derived fatty acid (FA) oxidation tricarboxylic acid cycle. speculate FA oxidation skeletal muscle forced facilitated upregulation PDK4, perceived essential component operation glucose-FA cycle starvation.
