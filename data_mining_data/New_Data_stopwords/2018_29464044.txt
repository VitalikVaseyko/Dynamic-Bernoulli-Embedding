 Metabolic alterations encountered tumors well recognized considered hallmark cancer. addition Warburg Effect, epidemiological experimental studies support crucial role lipid metabolism colorectal cancer (CRC). overexpression four lipid metabolism-related genes (ABCA1, ACSL1, AGPAT1 SCD genes) proposed prognostic marker stage II CRC (ColoLipidGene signature). order explore depth transcriptomic genomic scenarios ABCA1, ACSL1, AGPAT1 SCD genes, performed transcriptomic meta-analysis one thousand CRC individuals. Additionally analyzed genomic coding sequence 95 patients, find variants could orchestrate CRC prognosis. found genetic variant rs3071, located SCD gene, defines 9.77% stage II CRC patients high risk death. Moreover, individuals upregulation ABCA1 AGPAT1 expression increased risk CRC recurrence, independently tumor stage. ABCA1 emerges one main contributors signature's prognostic effect. Indeed, high ABCA1 expression presence tumoral genetic variants located ABCA1 coding region, seem associated CRC risk death. addition non-synonymous polymorphism rs2230808, located ABCA1, associated gene expression. Patients carrying least one copy minor allele showed higher levels ABCA1 expression patients carrying homozygous major allele. study broaden prognostic value ABCA1, ACSL1, AGPAT1 SCD genes, independently CRC tumor stage, leading future precision medicine approaches "omics"-guided therapies.
