 Long treatment regime d-penicillamine needed exert clinically meaningful benefits treatment copper toxicosis. consequence long-term d-penicillamine treatment associated numerous side effects. limitations d-penicillamine monotherapy prompted us search effective treatment strategies could decrease duration d-penicillamine therapy. present study designed evaluate therapeutic potential d-penicillamine combination another hepatoprotective drug, andrographolide treatment copper toxicosis rats. d-penicillamine treatment led excretion copper urine. Addition andrographolide d-penicillamine regime appeared increase protection liver increasing biliary excretion copper reduction cholestatic injury. early removal causative agent copper combination treatment effective therapeutic intervention contributed early rectification fibrosis liver. Combination treatment reduced Kupffer cells accumulation TNFalpha production liver copper exposed rats. particular, andrographolide mediated anti-inflammatory effect inhibiting cytokine production. However, another possible mechanism cytoprotection andrographolide decreasing mitochondrial production superoxide anions resulted better restoration mitochondrial dysfunction combination therapy monotherapy. Furthermore, ROS inhibition combination regimen resulted significant decline activation caspase cascade. Inhibition caspases attenuated apoptosis hepatocytes, induced chronic copper exposure. summary, study suggested added benefit combination treatment use either agent alone alleviating hepatotoxicity fibrosis associated copper toxicosis.
