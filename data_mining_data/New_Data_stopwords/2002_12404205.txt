 vivo rates glucose uptake, insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) content, activities glycolytic enzymes determined brown adipose tissue (BAT) rats adapted high-protein, carbohydrate-free (HP) diet. Adaptation HP diet resulted marked decreases BAT glucose uptake GLUT4 content. Replacement HP diet balanced control diet 24 hours restored BAT glucose uptake levels rats fed control diet, changes GLUT4 levels 4 5 animals examined. BAT denervation rats fed control diet induced 50% reduction glucose uptake, significantly affect already markedly reduced BAT hexose uptake HP diet-fed rats. suggested pronounced decrease BAT glucose uptake animals due combined effects HP diet-induced reductions plasma insulin levels BAT sympathetic activity. Adaptation HP diet accompanied decreased activities hexokinase, phosphofructo-1-kinase, pyruvate kinase (PK). activity BAT PK HP diet-fed rats reduced 50% controls, approached normal levels 24 hours diet reversion. BAT denervation induced small (15%) decrease BAT PK activity control rats, affect activity enzyme HP diet-adapted rats. Also, denervation interfere restoration PK activity induced diet substitution. Treatment anti-insulin serum resulted almost 50% reduction PK activity innervated denervated BAT rats fed control diet, caused much smaller ( thick approximate 20%) decrease BAT HP diet-fed rats. Furthermore, anti-insulin serum administration completely suppressed restoration BAT PK activity induced diet reversion. data suggest that, differently glucose uptake, BAT PK activity predominantly controlled hormonal/metabolic factors.
