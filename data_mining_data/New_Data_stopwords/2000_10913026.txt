 effects carbohydrate deprivation regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) studied rest moderate-intensity exercise. inhibitory effect chronic low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) active form PDH (PDHa) mediated stable increase PDH kinase (PDHK) activity recently reported (Peters SJ, Howlett RA, St. Amand TA, Heigenhauser GJF, Spriet LL. J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 275: E980-E986, 1998.). present study, seven males cycled 65% maximal O(2) uptake 30 min 6-day LCD. Exercise repeated 1 wk later mixed diet (MD). Muscle biopsies sampled vastus lateralis rest 2 30 min exercise. rest, PDHa activity (0.18 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.18 mmol x min(-1) x kg wet wt(-1)), muscle glycogen content (310.2 +/- 36.9 vs. 563.9 +/- 32.6 mmol/kg dry wt), muscle lactate content (2.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.6 mmol/kg dry wt) significantly lower LCD. Resting muscle acetyl-CoA (10.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 7.4 +/- 0.8 micromol/kg dry wt) acetylcarnitine (5.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt) contents significantly elevated LCD. exercise, PDHa, glycogenolytic rate (LCD 5.8 +/- 0.4 vs. MD 6.9 +/- 0.2 mmol x min(-1) x kg dry wt(-1)), muscle concentrations acetylcarnitine, pyruvate, lactate increased extent conditions. results present study suggest inhibition resting PDH elevated PDHK activity LCD may overridden availability muscle pyruvate exercise.
