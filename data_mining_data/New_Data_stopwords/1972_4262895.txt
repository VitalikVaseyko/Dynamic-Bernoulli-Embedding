 1. Parenchymal cells prepared mouse liver enzymic mechanical means. 2. dry weights, protein DNA contents cells determined. 3. Mouse liver ;M-' ;L-type' pyruvate kinases prepared free contamination other; kinetic properties examined method developed assay total liver homogenates. 4. Recoveries phosphoglycerate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase phosphofructokinase enzymically prepared cells indicate little, any, cytoplasmic protein lost preparation. 5. Parenchymal cells exhibit substantial increase activity ratio glucokinase hexokinase total liver homogenate; three eight experiments, hexokinase activity undetectable. 6. ;L-type' pyruvate kinase alone occurs parenchymal cell. Non-parenchymal cells characterized presence ;M-type' activity only. 7. Parenchymal cells contain glucose 6-phosphatase fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. non-parenchymal fraction appears contain fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, devoid glucose 6-phosphatase. 8. aldolase detectable whole liver. Aldolase B occurs parenchymal non-parenchymal tissue. 9. Parenchymal cells prepared mechanical disruption mouse liver 20% polyvinyl alcohol exhibit similar enzyme profile prepared enzymically. 10. methodology involved preparation isolated liver cells discussed. importance measurement several parameters criteria establishing viability parenchymal cells stressed. 11. metabolic implications results present study discussed.
