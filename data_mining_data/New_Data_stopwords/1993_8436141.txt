 Pyruvate kinase Bacillus stearothermophilus allosteric enzyme activated AMP ribose 5-phosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. gene enzyme cloned Escherichia coli entire nucleotide sequence determined. deduced amino acid sequence consisted 587 residues molecular mass calculated 62 317 Da. sequence highly similar pyruvate kinases, indicating evolutional origin. Similarly E. coli enzymes, enzyme contain N-terminal domain, contrast eukaryotic pyruvate kinases. However, Bacillus stearothermophilus enzyme extra C-terminal sequence consisting 110 amino acid residues. phosphoenolpyruvate-binding motif, observed pyruvate phosphate dikinase, phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, present extra C-terminal sequence. open reading frame upstream pyruvate kinase gene. homology sequence showed gene encodes phosphofructokinase. phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase expressed E. coli cells, evidence suggesting genes constitute operon presented.
