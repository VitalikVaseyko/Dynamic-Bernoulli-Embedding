 homodimer pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) integral part pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) anchored primarily inner lipoyl-bearing domains (L2) transacetylase component. catalytic cycle PDHK translocation PDC surface thought mediated "symmetric" "asymmetric" modes, PDHK dimer binds two one L2-domain(s), respectively. Whereas structure symmetric PDHK/L2 complex reported, structural organization functional role asymmetric complex remain obscure. Here, report crystal structure asymmetric PDHK3/L2 complex reveals several functionally important features absent previous structures. First, PDHK3 subunits distinct conformations: one subunit exhibits "open" "closed" configuration putative substrate-binding cleft. Second, access closed cleft additionally restricted local unwinding adjacent alpha-helix. Modeling indicates target peptide might gain access PDHK active center open closed cleft. Third, ATP-binding loop one PDHK3 subunit adopts open conformation, implying nucleotide loading active site mediated inactive "pre-insertion" binding mode. Altogether data suggest asymmetric complex represents physiological state binding single L2-domain activates one PDHK protomers inactivating another. Thus, L2-domains likely act structural anchors also modulate catalytic cycle PDHK.
