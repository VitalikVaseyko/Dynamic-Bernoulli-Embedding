 Cancer cells rely mainly glycolysis rather mitochondrial respiration energy production, called Warburg effect. p53 mutations observed half cancer cases, p53 controls cell cycle cell death response cellular stressors. p53 emphasized metabolic regulator involved glucose, glutamine, purine metabolism. Here, demonstrated metabolic changes cancer occurred p53. found p53-inducible microRNA-34a (miR-34a) repressed glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase 1, hexokinase 2, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. Treatment anti-miR-34a inhibitor relieved decreased expression enzymes following DNA damage. miR-34a-mediated inhibition enzymes resulted repressed glycolysis enhanced mitochondrial respiration. results suggest p53 miR-34a-dependent integrated mechanism regulate glucose metabolism.
