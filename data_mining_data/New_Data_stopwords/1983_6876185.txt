 effects myocardial ischemia reperfusion pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity studied isolated rat hearts. PDH remained largely (80%) active form 10 min whole heart ischemia hearts receiving 11 mM glucose substrate. reperfusion, PDH converted inactive form (45% 2 min) returned slowly control levels. Addition pyruvate (10 mM) glucose containing perfusate reperfusion prevent reperfusion inactivation PDH (96% active). maintenance high percent PDH active form ischemia occurred spite high mitochondrial ratios NADH/NAD acetyl CoA/CoA related low mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio. low ATP high ADP would restrict PDH kinase phosphorylation inactivation PDH ischemia. Reperfusion resulted rapid increase mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio increased availability ATP substrate kinase coupled continued high levels NADH acetyl CoA stimulate kinase activity may accounted early inactivation PDH reperfusion. Addition pyruvate perfusate probably inhibited PDH kinase prevent reperfusion inactivation PDH.
