 One anticancer strategy suggests targeting mitochondrial metabolism trigger cell death slowing energy production Warburg effect. Fenofibrate clinical lipid-lowering agent effective anticancer drug. present study, demonstrate fenofibrate provided novel mechanisms delaying oral tumor development via reprogramming metabolic processes. Fenofibrate induced cytotoxicity decreasing oxygen consumption rate (OCR) accompanied increasing extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) reducing ATP content. Moreover, fenofibrate caused changes protein expressions hexokinase II (HK II), pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), associated Warburg effect. addition, fenofibrate reprogrammed metabolic pathway interrupting binding HK II VDAC. oral cancer mouse model, fenofibrate exhibited preventive therapeutic efficacy oral tumorigenesis. Fenofibrate administration suppressed incidence rate tongue lesions, reduced tumor sizes, decreased tumor multiplicity, decreased immunoreactivities VDAC mTOR. molecular mechanisms involved fenofibrate's ability delay tumor development included down-regulation mTOR activity via TSC1/2-dependent signaling activation AMPK inactivation Akt, via TSC1/2-independent pathway direct suppression raptor. findings provide molecular rationale whereby fenofibrate exerts anticancer additional beneficial effects treatment oral cancer patients.
