 OBJECTIVE: investigate PON 1/Aryl activities basketball players without alpha-T supplementation pre- post-training. Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol, alpha-T) reduces lipid peroxidation. Paraoxonase 1/arylesterase (PON 1/Aryl) activities closely related oxidation atherogenesis. SUBJECT/METHODS: Blood obtained 10 players pre- (group A), post-exercise (group B) 1 month alpha-T (200 mg per 24 h orally) supplementation pre- (group C) post-exercise (group D). Lactate, pyruvate, muscle enzyme activities, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase total antioxidant status (TAS) measured commercial kits. Catecholamines alpha-T determined high-performance liquid chromatography methods PON 1/Aryl activities spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Lactate, pyruvate, muscle enzyme activities catecholamines increased (P<0.001) groups post-training. Alpha-T levels remained unaltered pre- vs post-exercise. TAS decreased groups post training. PON 1/Aryl activities significantly decreased post-exercise (group B) (PON1: 65+/-12 U min(-1) ml(-1), Aryl: 58+/-14 KU min(-1) ml(-1)) compared pre-exercise (group A) (PON1: 142+/-16 U min(-1) ml(-1), Aryl: 114+/-12 KU min(-1) ml(-1), P<0.001). contrast, studied enzyme activities remained practically unaltered alpha-T supplementation pre- vs post-training. enzyme activities positively correlated TAS (r=0.60, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Alpha-T supplementation may result protection enzyme PON 1/Aryl activities free radical production.
