 5-Lipoxygenase catalyzes first two steps biosynthesis leukotrienes, potent extracellular mediators inflammation allergic disorders. unanticipated observation 5-lipoxygenase nucleus cell types including bone marrow-derived mast cells (Chen, X. S., Naumann, T. A., Kurre, U., Jenkins, N. A., Copeland, N. G., Funk, C. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 17993-17999) raised speculation intranuclear actions leukotrienes enzyme itself. explore entry 5-lipoxygenase nucleus transfected various cell types expression vectors encoding native 5-lipoxygenase green fluorescent protein/5-lipoxygenase (GFP-5LO) fusion proteins. 5-Lipoxygenase green fluorescent protein/5-lipoxygenase co-localized nuclear DNA stain Hoechst 33258 cell type. three main basic regions 5-lipoxygenase incapable acting "classical" nuclear localization signal sequences. Mutations abolished enzyme activity/non-heme iron resulted proteins would longer enter nucleus. NH2-terminal 5-lipoxygenase fragment 80 residues sufficient directing nuclear localization green fluorescent protein cytosolic pyruvate kinase. combined data suggest 5-lipoxygenase enters nucleus classical nuclear localization signal non-conventional signal located predicted beta-barrel domain may masked structural alterations.
