 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) precipitated supernatant fluids whole mouse liver homogenates specific antiserum normal rabbit immunoglobulin G. slopes inactivation curves similar supernatant fluids control poisoned mice. demonstrated radial immunodiffusion PEPCK activity assayed enzymatically proportional diameter precipitin rings cases, except enzyme activated tryptophan, process requiring new enzyme synthesis. Hence, assay used distinguish enhanced catalytic activity due increased enzyme levels result activation existing enzyme molecules. Immunological quantitation PEPCK showed endotoxin inhibits induction enzyme due fasting 4 8 hr administration bacterial poison. result almost identical seen livers mice poisoned actinomycin assayed PEPCK radial immunodiffusion technique.
