 1. Addition non-dialysable, heat-labile acid-precipitable factor absorbed DEAE-cellulose column, could restore sensitivity chromatographed muscle pyruvate kinase Marphysa sanguinea towards phosphocreatine inhibition. 2. factor, non-specific acts pyruvate kinase isozymes different sources, demonstrated high creatine kinase activity. 3. High concentrations ADP, creatine replacement ADP IDP/UDP high pH abolished inhibition indicating inhibition mediated creatine kinase depleting ADP. 4. Apparent inhibition phosphocreatine related relative activities 3 intracellular enzymes--pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase adenosine triphosphatase.
