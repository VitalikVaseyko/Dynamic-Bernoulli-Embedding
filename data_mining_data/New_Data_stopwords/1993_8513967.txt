 D-Glyceraldehyde irreversibly inhibited rat liver glucokinase concentration-dependent manner. inactivation glucokinase glyceraldehyde blocked presence substrates glucose mannose. Glucokinase highly sensitive glyceraldehyde compared glycolytic enzymes (from animal tissues) including hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 6-phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase. amino acid analysis untreated glyceraldehyde-treated glucokinase suggested glyceraldehyde-induced inactivation glucokinase caused glycation Lys residues enzyme triose. Treatment pancreatic islets 6 mM glyceraldehyde 1 h 37 degrees C caused inactivation glucokinase inhibition glucose-induced insulin secretion. Another glucose-phosphorylating enzyme (hexokinase) pancreatic islets, however, little affected glyceraldehyde. addition, glyceraldehyde affect insulin secretory responses islets nonglucose secretagogues glyceraldehyde Leu. pancreatic islets cultured lower concentration (1 mM) glyceraldehyde longer time (17 h) presence 10 mM glucose mimic vivo conditions, glucokinase activity glucose-induced insulin secretion decreased. study demonstrates glucose-induced insulin secretion impaired glyceraldehyde inactivation glucokinase. implication finding pathophysiology type II diabetes discussed.
