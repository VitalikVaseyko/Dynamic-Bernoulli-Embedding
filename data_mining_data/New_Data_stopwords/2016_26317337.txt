 Candida albicans major fungal pathogen member commensal human microflora. morphological switch yeast hyphal growth associated disease many environmental factors known influence yeast-to-hyphae switch. Ras1-Cyr1-PKA pathway major regulator C. albicans morphogenesis well biofilm formation white-opaque switching. Previous studies shown hyphal growth strongly repressed mitochondrial inhibitors. Here, show mitochondrial inhibitors strongly decreased Ras1 GTP-binding activity C. albicans similar effects observed Candida species. Consistent connection respiratory activity GTP-Ras1 binding, mutants lacking complex complex IV grew yeast hypha-inducing conditions, lower levels GTP-Ras1, Ras1 GTP-binding unaffected respiratory inhibitors. Mitochondria-perturbing agents decreased intracellular ATP concentrations metabolomics analyses cells grown different respiratory inhibitors found consistent perturbation pyruvate metabolism TCA cycle, changes redox state, increased catabolism lipids, decreased sterol content suggested increased AMP kinase activity. Biochemical genetic experiments provide strong evidence model activation Ras1 controlled ATP levels AMP kinase independent manner. Ras1 GTPase activating protein, Ira2, Ras1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Cdc25, required reduction Ras1-GTP response inhibitor-mediated reduction ATP levels. Furthermore, Cyr1, well-characterized Ras1 effector, participated control Ras1-GTP binding response decreased mitochondrial activity suggesting revised model Ras1 Cyr1 signaling Cyr1 Ras1 influence and, together Ira2, seem form master-regulatory complex necessary integrate different environmental intracellular signals, including metabolic status, decide fate cellular morphology.
