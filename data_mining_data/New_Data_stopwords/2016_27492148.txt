 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key driver aerobic glycolysis cancer cells shown up-regulated mTOR vitro. previous proteomic profiling studies showed PKM2 significantly upregulated cervical cancer tissues treatment neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Whether PKM2 expression predicts cisplatin-based NACT sensitivity mTOR dependent cervical cancer patients remains unclear. Using paired tumor samples (pre- post-chemotherapy) 36 cervical cancer patients, examined mTOR, HIF-1alpha, c-Myc, PKM2 expression cervical cancer samples investigated response cisplatin-based NACT. addition, established PKM2 suppressed cervical cancer cell lines evaluated sensitivity cisplatin vitro. found mTOR/HIF-1alpha/c-Myc/PKM2 signaling pathway significantly downregulated post-chemotherapy cervical cancer tissues. High levels mTOR, HIF-1alpha, c-Myc, PKM2 associated positive chemotherapy response cervical cancer patients treated cisplatin-based NACT. vitro, PKM2 knockdown desensitized cervical cancer cells cisplatin. Moreover, PKM2 complex interactions mTOR pathways. mTOR, HIF1alpha, c-Myc, PKM2 expression cervical cancer may serve predictive biomarkers cisplatin-based chemotherapy. PKM2 enhances chemosensitivity cisplatin interaction mTOR pathway cervical cancer.
