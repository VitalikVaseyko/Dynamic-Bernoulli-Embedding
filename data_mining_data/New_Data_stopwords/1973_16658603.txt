 changes isocitrate lyase levels respect catabolism triglycerides studied germination Pinus pinea seeds. studied effects octanoate, oleate, inhibitors protein synthesis isocitrate lyase germination. Pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase also assayed. Octanoate oleate inhibited isocitrate lyase activity, similarly cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, actinomycin, inhibitors protein biosynthesis. inhibitory effect specific strikingly evident isocitrate lyase. inhibition proportional concentration proportional chain length oleate octanoate.
