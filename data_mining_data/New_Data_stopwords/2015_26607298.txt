 Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) represents highly malignant, rare soft tissue sarcoma high rates morbidity mortality. Previously, demonstrated tissue-isolated human LMS xenografts perfused situ highly sensitive direct anticancer effects physiological nocturnal blood levels melatonin inhibited tumour cell proliferative activity, linoleic acid (LA) uptake metabolism 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). Here, show effects low pharmacological blood concentrations melatonin following oral ingestion melatonin supplement healthy adult human female subjects tumour proliferative activity, aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) LA metabolic signalling tissue-isolated LMS xenografts perfused situ blood. Melatonin markedly suppressed aerobic glycolysis induced complete inhibition tumour LA uptake, 13-HODE release, well significant reductions tumour cAMP levels, DNA content [(3) H]-thymidine incorporation DNA. Furthermore, melatonin completely suppressed phospho-activation ERK 1/2, AKT, GSK3beta NF-kB (p65). addition S20928, nonselective melatonin antagonist, reversed melatonin inhibitory effects. Moreover, vitro cell culture studies, physiological concentrations melatonin repressed cell proliferation cell invasion. results demonstrate nocturnal melatonin directly inhibited tumour growth invasion human LMS via suppression Warburg effect, LA uptake related signalling mechanisms. understanding novel signalling pathway(s) association aerobic glycolysis LA metabolism human LMS may lead new circadian-based therapies prevention treatment LMS potentially mesenchymally derived solid tumours.
