 reviewed anti-cancer effects DCA, orphan drug long used investigational treatment various acquired congenital disorders mitochondrial intermediary metabolism. Inhibition DCA mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases subsequent reactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex oxidative phosphorylation common mechanism accounting drug's anti-neoplastic effects. least two fundamental changes tumor metabolism induced DCA antagonize tumor growth, metastases survival: first redirection glucose metabolism glycolysis oxidation (reversal Warburg effect), leading inhibition proliferation induction caspase-mediated apoptosis. effects replicated human cancer cell lines tumor implants diverse germ line origin. second fundamental change oxidative removal lactate, via pyruvate, co-incident buffering hydrogen ions dehydrogenases located mitochondrial matrix. Preclinical studies demonstrate DCA additive synergistic effects used combination standard agents designed modify tumor oxidative stress, vascular remodeling, DNA integrity immunity. findings limited clinical results suggest potentially fruitful areas additional clinical trials include 1) adult pediatric high grade astrocytomas; 2) BRAF-mutant cancers, melanoma, perhaps combined pro-oxidants; 3) tumors resistance standard platinum-class drugs alone may overcome combination therapy; 4) tumors endodermal origin, extensive experimental research demonstrated significant anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic effects DCA, leading improved host survival.
