 Clostridium thermoaceticum ferments xylose, fructose, glucose acetate product. fermentations mixtures sugars, xylose first fermented, fructose, last, glucose. Fructose inhibits fermentation glucose, inhibition appears due repression synthesis enzyme needed glucose utilization. Addition metals culture medium increases cell yield drastically 7 18 g per liter, Y(glucose) values 40 50 obtained. According postulated pathways fermentation glucose synthesis acetate CO(2) C. thermoaceticum, 3 mol ATP available energy growth. Thus Y(adenosine 5'-triphosphate) 13 16 obtained. normal Y(ATP) value 10.5, could mean additional source ATP available unknown mechanism. addition metals also increases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent formate dehydrogenase activity, overall reaction ((14)CO(2) --> acetate), incorporation methyl group 5-methyltetrahydrofolate acetate. reactions catalyzed efficiently cells harvested early growth, whereas cells obtained end fermentation low formate dehydrogenase activity capacity incorporate CO(2) acetate. following enzymes involved synthesis acetate CO(2) metabolism pyruvate present extracts C. thermoaceticum: 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, phosphate acetyltransferase, acetate kinase. enzymes little affected addition metals growth medium. amount corrinoids cells early growth low, whereas high cells harvested late growth. opposite found activity delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase, high beginning growth low end.
