 OBJECTIVE: characterize metabolic system oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) metabolome analysis. STUDY DESIGN: metabolome profiles, including Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMPP), pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), amino acids, obtained OSCC surrounding normal tissues (32 patients) using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometer. RESULTS: Enhancement glucose consumption lactate production (Warburg effect) observed OSCC tissues. decrease glucose along decrease downstream intermediates EMPP suggests incorporated glucose mainly consumed biosynthesis. Glutamine consumption increase intermediates last half TCAC suggests involvement glutaminolysis, glutamine converted lactate via last half TCAC. CONCLUSIONS: suggested OSCC tissues show Warburg effect, stems combined enhancement glucose consumption glutaminolysis.
