 well-fed state relatively high activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) reduces blood glucose levels directing carbon pyruvate citric acid cycle. fasted state relatively low activity PDC helps maintain blood glucose levels conserving pyruvate three carbon compounds gluconeogenesis. relative activities pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) opposing pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases determine activity PDC fed fasted states. regulation PDK4 largely responsible inactivation PDC fasted state. PDK4 knockout mice lower fasting blood glucose levels wild type mice, proving regulation PDK4 important normal glucose homeostasis. type 2 diabetes, regulation PDK4 also inactivates PDC, promotes gluconeogenesis thereby contributes hyperglycemia characteristic disease. fed high fat diet, wild type mice develop fasting hyperglycemia PDK4 knockout mice remain euglycemic, proving regulation PDK4 contributes hyperglycemia diabetes. finding suggest PDK4 inhibitors might prove useful treatment type 2 diabetes.
