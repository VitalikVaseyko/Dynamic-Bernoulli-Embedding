 Glycolysis occupies central role cellular metabolism, particular importance catabolic production ATP protozoan parasites Leishmania Trypanosoma. organisms pyruvate kinase plays key regulatory role, unique responding fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosteric activator. determination crystal structure first eukaryotic pyruvate kinase T-state (the inactive 'tense' conformation allosteric enzymes) described. comparison effector sites Leishmania yeast enzymes reveals structural basis different effector specificity. Two loops, comprising residues 443-453 480-489, adopt different conformations two enzymes, Lys-453 His-480 feature trypanosomatid enzymes provide probable ligands 2-phospho group effector molecule. differences offer opportunity design drugs would exploit regulatory differences parasite host.
