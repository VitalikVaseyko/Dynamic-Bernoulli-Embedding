 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inactivates multienzyme mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphorylation three seryl residues pyruvate dehydrogenase moiety, thus plays important role control glucose homeostasis. Genetically biochemically distinct PDK family isozymes identified mammalian species. present study, demonstrate complete family expressed PDK family genes tissues African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, consists four members, divided two evolutionary groups. Xenopus PDKs (xPDKs) share overall homology 70% human isoforms PDK. abundance mRNAs four xPDK isoforms analyzed real-time reverse transcriptase PCR technique various tissues Xenopus laevis, including heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, skin, testis, oocytes, eggs. data suggest one xPDK isozymes referred oocyte-specific xPDK. Functional differences xPDK isoforms discussed, based different tissue-specific distributions phylogenetic similarities human PDKs.
