 Using random arbitrarily primed-reverse transcribed-PCR sequence analysis, investigated changes lymphocytic molecules cell-cell contact fibroblasts. mRNA species upregulated Jurkat cells cell-cell contact MRHF cells (a human foreskin fibroblast line) identified coding human interleukin-17 receptor. finding confirmed quantitative RT-PCR HUT78 Jurkat cell lines, peripheral blood lymphocytes, tonsillar cells. Furthermore, interleukin-17 mRNA, coding proinflammatory cytokine, also upregulated peripheral blood lymphocytes tonsillar cells cell-cell contact fibroblasts. Supernatants obtained cell-cell contact-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes enhance production interleukin-6 interleukin-8 fibroblast-like synoviocytes effect could blocked interleukin-17 antibodies. Changes mRNA levels Jurkat cells induced cell-cell contact adherent cells also found M-type pyruvate kinase, tropomyosin TM30 p54nrb gene product.
