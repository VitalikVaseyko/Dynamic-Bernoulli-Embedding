 Gemcitabine, effective agent treatment cancer pancreas, undergone failures many instances multiple cycles therapy due emergence drug resistance. Combination dietary compounds clinically validated drugs emerged effective therapeutic approach treat pancreatic tumors, refractory gemcitabine therapy. order optimize possible synergistic combination Gemcitabine (GCB) dietary molecules, Betuilnic acid (BA) Thymoquinone (TQ), stand-alone IC50 dose GCB, BA TQ calculated pancreatic cancer cell lines. Fixed IC50 dose ratio dietary molecules combination reduced IC50 dose GCB tested GCB resistant PANC-1 sensitive MIA PaCa-2 cells synergism, additive response antagonism, using calcusyn. Combination index (CI) revealed pre-treatment BA TQ along GCB synergistically inhibited cancer cell proliferation in-vitro experiments. Pyruvate kinase (PK) M2 isoform, promising target involved cancer cell metabolism, showed down-regulation presence TQ BA combination GCB. GCB BA acted preferentially tumor mitochondria triggered mitochondrial permeability transition. Pre-exposure cell lines, MIA PaCa-2 PANC-1, TQ combination GCB induced apoptosis. Thus, effectiveness BA TQ combination GCB inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis down-regulate expression PKM2, reflects promise pancreatic cancer treatment.
