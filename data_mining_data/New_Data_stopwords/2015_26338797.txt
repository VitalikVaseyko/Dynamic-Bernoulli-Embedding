 short hairpin RNA screen genes affect AKT phosphorylation, identified RAB35 small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-a protein previously implicated endomembrane trafficking-as regulator phosphatidylinositol 3'-OH kinase (PI3K) pathway. Depletion RAB35 suppresses AKT phosphorylation response growth factors, whereas expression dominant active GTPase-deficient mutant RAB35 constitutively activates PI3K/AKT pathway. RAB35 functions downstream growth factor receptors upstream PDK1 mTORC2 copurifies PI3K immunoprecipitation assays. Two somatic RAB35 mutations found human tumors generate alleles constitutively activate PI3K/AKT signaling, suppress apoptosis, transform cells PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, oncogenic RAB35 sufficient drive platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha LAMP2-positive endomembranes absence ligand, suggesting may latent oncogenic potential dysregulated endomembrane trafficking.
