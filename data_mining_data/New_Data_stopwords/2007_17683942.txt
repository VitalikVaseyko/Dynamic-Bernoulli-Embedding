 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms molecular switches downregulate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) reversible phosphorylation mitochondria. determined structures human PDK1 PDK3 bound inhibitors AZD7545, dichloroacetate (DCA), radicicol. show trifluoromethylpropanamide end AZD7545 projects lipoyl-binding pocket PDK1. interaction results inhibition PDK1 PDK3 activities aborting kinase binding PDC scaffold. Paradoxically, AZD7545 saturating concentrations robustly increases scaffold-free PDK3 activity, similar inner lipoyl domain. Good DCA density present helix bundle N-terminal domain PDK1. Bound DCA promotes local conformational changes communicated nucleotide-binding lipoyl-binding pockets PDK1, leading inactivation kinase activity. Finally, radicicol inhibits kinase activity binding directly ATP-binding pocket PDK3, similar Hsp90 Topo VI ATPase/kinase superfamily.
