 shown experiments rat liver mitochondria glucose hexo-kinase load excess substrates (1-20 mM) pyruvate, acetate, propionate, pent-4-enoate malate may induce oxidation NAD(P)H inhibition mitochondrial respiration (by 20-50% more) due decreased rate hydrogen production tricarboxylic acid cycle. concluded analysis mathematical models metabolite-testings remove inhibition pyruvate acetate inhibition autocatalytic one. related decreased level CoA oxaloacetate due formation "traps" acetyl-CoA alpha-kotoglutarate. propionate pent-4-enoate bicarbonate-free medium suppression flux cycle concerned decreased level CoA, acetyl-CoA succionoyl CoA due accumulation propionyl-CoA. seems also concerned inhibition citrate-synthetase alpha-ketoglutarate-dehydrogenase propionyl-CoA. Malate (in presence malonate) inhibit respiration expense direct inhibition citrate-synthetase.
