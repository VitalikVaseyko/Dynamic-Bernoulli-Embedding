 human leukaemic cell line HL60 undergoes differentiation granulocyte-like cells response dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). rates glucose glutamine utilization studied HL60 cells either undifferentiated fully differentiated 9 days exposure DMSO. Differentiation alter rate utilization exogenous glucose, approximately 75% converted lactate case. activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase citrate synthase similarly unaffected. contrast, activity oxidative segment pentose-phosphate pathway enhanced differentiation, glycogen synthase activity could detected. observations consistent significantly lower content glycogen, increased activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase increased oxidation [1-14C] glucose relative [6-14C] glucose differentiated cells. Glucose utilization depressed exogenous glutamine but, time, glutamine utilization enhanced glucose cell types; reciprocal effects pronounced undifferentiated HL60 cells. Glucose utilization may depressed presence glutamine result allosteric inhibition rate-limiting step glycolysis (eg. phosphofructokinase). spite glutaminase activity twice differentiated counterparts, uptake glutamine undifferentiated HL60 cells low, especially sole substrate. stimulation glutaminolysis glucose may due activation mitochondrial glutamine transport. large proportion glutamine utilized cells contributed net accumulation glutamate, aspartate alanine, whilst 35% oxidized CO2. contrast, almost glucose utilized converted lactate little oxidized. high rates glycolysis glutaminolysis observed differentiation may contribute primarily energy production may supply, undifferentiated cells, substrates biosynthetic processes generate nucleic acid precursors or, case differentiated cells synthesize reactive oxygen intermediates, substrates maintain NADP reduced state.
