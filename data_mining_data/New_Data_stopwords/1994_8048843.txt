 xylose metabolism Bacteroides xylanolyticus X5-1 studied determining specific enzyme activities cell free extracts, following 13C-label distribution patterns growing cultures mass balance calculations. Enzyme activities pentose phosphate pathway Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway sufficiently high account vivo xylose fermentation pyruvate via combination two pathways. Pyruvate mainly oxidized acetyl-CoA, CO2 reduced cofactor (ferredoxin). Part pyruvate converted acetyl-CoA formate means pyruvate-formate lyase. Acetyl-CoA either converted acetate combined action phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase reduced ethanol acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ethanol dehydrogenase. latter two enzymes displayed NADH- NADPH-linked activity. Cofactor regeneration proceeded via reduction intermediates metabolism (i.e. acetyl-CoA acetaldehyde) via proton reduction. According deduced pathway 2.5 mol ATP generated per mol xylose degraded.
