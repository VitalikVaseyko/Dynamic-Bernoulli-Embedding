 human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) regulated reversible phosphorylation four isoforms pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). PDKs phosphorylate serine residues dehydrogenase (E1p) component PDC, amino-acid sequences unrelated eukaryotic Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases. PDK3 binds inner lipoyl domains (L2) 60-meric transacetylase (E2p) core PDC, concomitant stimulated kinase activity. Here, present crystal structures PDK3-L2 complex without bound ADP ATP. structures disclose C-terminal tail one subunit PDK3 dimer constitutes integral part lipoyl-binding pocket N-terminal domain opposing subunit. two swapped C-terminal tails promote conformational changes active-site clefts PDK3 subunits, resulting largely disordered ATP lids ADP-bound form. structural biochemical data suggest L2 binding stimulates PDK3 activity disrupting ATP lid, otherwise traps ADP, remove product inhibition exerted nucleotide. hypothesize allosteric mechanism accounts, part, E2p-augmented PDK3 activity.
