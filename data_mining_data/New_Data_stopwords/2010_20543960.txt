 BACKGROUND: Mapping expression changes breast cancer development facilitate basic translational research eventually improve understanding clinical management cancer. However, studies area challenged genetic environmental heterogeneities associated cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: conducted proteomics MCF10AT breast cancer model, comprises 4 isogenic xenograft-derived human cell lines mimic different stages breast cancer progression, using iTRAQ-based tandem mass spectrometry. 1200 proteins detected, 98 proteins representing least 20 molecular function groups including kinases, proteases, adhesion, calcium binding cytoskeletal proteins found display significant expression changes across MCF10AT model. number proteins showed different expression levels increased disease progressed AT1k pre-neoplastic cells low grade CA1h cancer cells high grade cancer cells. Bioinformatics revealed MCF10AT model breast cancer progression associated major re-programming metabolism, one first identified biochemical hallmarks tumor cells (the "Warburg effect"). Aberrant expression 3 novel breast cancer-associated proteins namely AK1, ATOX1 HIST1H2BM subsequently validated via immunoblotting MCF10AT model immunohistochemistry progressive clinical breast cancer lesions. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: information generated study serve useful reference future basic translational cancer research. Dysregulation ATOX1, AK1 HIST1HB2M could detected early pre-neoplastic stage. findings implications early detection stratification patients adjuvant therapy.
