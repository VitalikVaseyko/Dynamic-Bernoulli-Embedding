 Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) natural compound involved chemoprevention well inhibition cell growth induction apoptosis several types cancer cells. Previous studies revealed PEITC suppresses invasion AGS gastric HT-29 colorectal cancer cells. However, effects PEITC metastasis SAS oral cancer cells remain determined. results showed PEITC treatment inhibited invasion EGF-stimulated SAS cells concentration-dependent manner, appeared affect cell viability. expression enzymatic activities matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) suppressed PEITC. Concomitantly, observed increase protein expression tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) -2 (TIMP-2) treated cells. Furthermore, PEITC treatments decreased protein phosphorylation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) downstream signaling proteins including PDK1, PI3K (p85), AKT, phosphorylated IKK IkappaB inactivate NF-kappaB suppression MMP-2 MMP-9 expression. addition, PEITC trigger MAPK signaling pathway increase phosphorylated p38, JNK ERK treated cells. data indicate PEITC able inhibit invasion EGF-stimulated SAS oral cancer cells targeting EGFR downstream signaling molecules finally lead reduced expression enzymatic activities MMP-2 MMP-9. results suggest PEITC promising therapy oral cancer metastasis.
