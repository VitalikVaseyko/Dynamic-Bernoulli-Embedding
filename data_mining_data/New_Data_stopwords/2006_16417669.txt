 aim study illustrate difficulties establishing diagnosis mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) disorders based clinical grounds combination intermediate activities MRC enzyme complexes. reviewed retrospectively medical laboratory records patients initially considered likely MRC disorders clinical grounds, subsequently diagnosed disorders (n = 20; 11 males, 9 females). Data retrieved hospital records, referral letters, results enzymatic analysis reference laboratory. Clinical symptoms included developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, movement disorder, spastic quadriplegia, tetany, microcephaly, visual problems, carpopedal spasms, dysmorphism, hearing loss, muscle weakness rhabdomyolysis, fulminant hepatitis. Blood cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels elevated 13/20 9/20 respectively. One MRC complex activities (expressed ratios relative citrate synthase and/or complex II activity) less 50% control mean activity 11/20 patients (including patients deficiencies pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pantothenate kinase, holocarboxylase synthetase, long-chain hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, molybdenum co-factor, neonatal haemochromatosis). One patient pattern suggestive mitochondrial proliferation. conclude intermediate results MRC enzymes interpreted caution clinicians actively looking underlying diagnoses.
