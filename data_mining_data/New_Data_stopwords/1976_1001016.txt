 ratio 34.5 NA+/O2, 5.8 Na+/ATP obtained ouabain sensitive sodium pump, accounts 50% sodium transport perfused kidney. Na-K-ATP'ase activity accounts 15% renal O2 uptake sodium transport may account 30% renal oxygen uptake. 2. Hydrogen ion secretion requires little extra energy. increase respiration produced increasing filtered load potassium prevented ouabain active potassium secretion produced detectable increases oxygen consumption. 3. general, rate oxidation substrates presented individually correlate well theoretical energy requirement sodium transport. Exceptions low rate oxidation glutamine, consistent limited sodium transport, glucose, expected observed rates glucose oxidation close agreement. 4. difference substrates cannot explained activity pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase activation, futile cycling PFK/FDP'ase, involvement malate-aspartate shuttle.
