 production two yeast expression systems recombinant forms major proteins cocoa bean described. Three major protein species found cocoa bean: albumin molecular mass 21 kDa (p21) two insoluble vicilin-like proteins molecular mass 31 kDa 47 kDa (p31 p47, respectively). p31 p47 species known derived common 67-kDa precursor (p67) post-translational processing includes deletion hydrophilic domain located immediately N-terminal signal sequence. three proteins appear targeted membrane-bound storage organelles N-terminal signal sequences. p21 p67 coding sequences expressed Hansenula polymorpha using powerful methanol oxidase (MOX) promoter Saccharomyces cerevisiae using promoter pyruvate kinase (PYK) gene. expression constructs contained native plant signal sequence, various yeast signals. p21 protein successfully expressed secreted yeasts. insoluble p67 protein proved difficult. Species correct molecular mass recovered internally small amounts p47 species secreted using yeast leader sequence. However, proteolytic cleavage, probably due Kex2p-like processing, led appearance protein species.
