 study investigated variations maximal activities rate-controlling glycolytic enzymes (i.e., hexokinase, HK; phosphofructokinase, PFK; pyruvate kinase, PK) pyruvate-dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) early embryogenesis Xenopus laevis (from cleavage hatching). enzymatic assays, using different coupled reactions, performed spectrophotometrically cytosolic mitochondrial fractions. maximal HK activity increases markedly neurulation onwards, PFK activity presents peak around gastrulation, PK activity remains relatively constant throughout period studied highest PDHc activity observed cleavage. specific activities display temporal pattern. Furthermore, sequence reactions glucose degraded form acetyl-CoA, maximal activities PFK PK limiting HK PDHc could rate-limiting relatively late developmental stages (hatching).
