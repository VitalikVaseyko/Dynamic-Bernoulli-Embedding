 Drought tolerance key trait increasing stabilizing barley productivity dry areas worldwide. Identification genes responsible drought tolerance barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) facilitate understanding molecular mechanisms drought tolerance, also facilitate genetic improvement barley marker-assisted selection gene transformation. monitor changes gene expression transcriptional level barley leaves reproductive stage drought conditions, 22K Affymetrix Barley 1 microarray used screen two drought-tolerant barley genotypes, Martin Hordeum spontaneum 41-1 (HS41-1), one drought-sensitive genotype Moroc9-75. Seventeen genes expressed exclusively two drought-tolerant genotypes drought stress, encoded proteins may play significant roles enhancing drought tolerance controlling stomatal closure via carbon metabolism (NADP malic enzyme, NADP-ME, pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH), synthesizing osmoprotectant glycine-betaine (C-4 sterol methyl oxidase, CSMO), generating protectants reactive-oxygen-species scavenging (aldehyde dehydrogenase,ALDH, ascorbate-dependent oxidoreductase, ADOR), stabilizing membranes proteins (heat-shock protein 17.8, HSP17.8, dehydrin 3, DHN3). Moreover, 17 genes abundantly expressed Martin HS41-1 compared Moroc9-75 drought control conditions. genes possibly constitutively expressed drought-tolerant genotypes. Among them, seven known annotated genes might enhance drought tolerance signalling [such calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) membrane steroid binding protein (MSBP)], anti-senescence (G2 pea dark accumulated protein, GDA2), detoxification (glutathione S-transferase, GST) pathways. addition, 18 genes, including encoding Delta(l)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), protein phosphatase 2C-like protein (PP2C), several chaperones, differentially expressed genotypes drought; thus likely general drought-responsive genes barley. results could provide new insights understanding drought-tolerance mechanisms barley.
