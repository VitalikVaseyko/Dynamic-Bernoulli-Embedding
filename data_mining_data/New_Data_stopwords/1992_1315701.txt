 Respiration fat body (Periplaneta americana) mitochondria increased pretreatment tissue corpus cardiacum (CC) extract. magnitude increase depends type substrate supplied oxidation. 5 mM pyruvate respiration increased 22%, decreasing 0 1 mM pyruvate. contrast, 50 microM 0.2 mM palmitic acid supported increase CC-stimulated respiration 14 44%, respectively. Unlike crude CC extract, synthetic hyperglycemic peptides CCI CCII failed alter respiratory activity fat body mitochondria. common action CC extract pretreatment fat body vitro 10(-5) cyclic AMP, 10(-5) 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, 10(-5) forskolin increased mitochondrial respiration approximately 30%. Octopamine (10(-4) M) elicited response similar obtained CC extract. Neither 10(-5) cyclic AMP 10(-5) 8-bromo-cyclic AMP stimulated respiration applied directly mitochondria. results suggest factor CC extract manifests effect intracellularly activation cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. interpretation also based finding diamide, inhibitor protein kinase, inhibits CC-dependent cyclic AMP-dependent mitochondrial respiration. physiological role CC factor responsible known.
