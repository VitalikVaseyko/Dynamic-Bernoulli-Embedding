 Recent reports suggested haemolytic anaemia pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase (P5'N) deficiency might due impaired erythrocyte hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS). investigate relationship pyrimidine accumulation, HMS impairment shortened red-cell survival, tested glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PD), HMS, P5'N activities UV spectrum whole red cells red cells different age 2 P5'N-deficient patients different degrees haemolytic anaemia. whole red cells found reduction G-6PD stimulated HMS activity presence variable amount pyrimidine nucleotides (37.79 17.88 mumol/gHb respectively). drastic inhibition stimulated HMS activity already present lightest red-cell fractions patient 1, presented severe haemolytic anaemia. variable degree pyrimidines found among red cell fractions, minor accumulation older red cells, supports hypothesis pyrimidine accumulation HMS impairment occur younger erythrocytes P5'N-deficient patients.
