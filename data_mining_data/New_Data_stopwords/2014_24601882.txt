 previous studies showed insulin stimulated AKT1 translocation mitochondria modulated oxidative phosphorylation complex V cardiac muscle. raised possibility mitochondrial AKT1 may regulate glycolytic oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial function cardiac muscle cells. aims project study effects mitochondrial AKT1 signaling cell survival stressed cardiomyocytes, define effect mitochondrial AKT1 signaling glycolytic bioenergetics, identify mitochondrial targets AKT1 signaling cardiomyocytes. Mitochondrial AKT1 signaling played protective role apoptosis necrosis ischemia-reperfusion stress, suppressed mitochondrial calcium overload, alleviated mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Activation AKT1 signaling mitochondria increased glucose uptake, enhanced respiration efficiency, reduced superoxide generation, increased ATP production cardiomyocytes. Inhibition mitochondrial AKT attenuated insulin response, indicating insulin regulation ATP production required mitochondrial AKT1 signaling. proteomic approach used reveal 15 novel targets AKT1 signaling mitochondria, including pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). confirmed characterized association AKT1 PDC subunits verified stimulatory effect mitochondrial AKT1 enzymatic activity PDC. findings suggested AKT1 formed protein complexes multiple mitochondrial proteins improved mitochondrial function stressed cardiomyocytes. novel AKT1 signaling targets mitochondria may become resource future metabolism research.
