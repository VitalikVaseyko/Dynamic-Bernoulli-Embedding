 BACKGROUND PURPOSE: PPARbeta enhances insulin sensitivity adipocytes skeletal muscle cells, effects insulin signalling endothelial cells known. analysed effects PPARbeta/delta (PPARbeta) agonists, GW0742 L165041, impaired insulin signalling induced high glucose HUVECs aortic mesenteric arteries diabetic rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Insulin-stimulated production, Akt-Ser(473) eNOS-Ser(1177) phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production studied HUVECs incubated low- high-glucose medium. Insulin-stimulated relaxations protein phosphorylation vessels streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats also analysed. KEY RESULTS: HUVECs incubated high-glucose medium showed significant reduction insulin-stimulated production NO. High glucose also reduced insulin-induced Akt-Ser(473) eNOS-Ser(1177) phosphorylation, increased IRS-1-Ser(636) ERK1/2-Thr(183) -Tyr(185) phosphorylation increased ROS production. co-incubation PPARbeta agonists GW0742 L165041 prevented effects induced high glucose. turn, effects induced agonists suppressed HUVEC also incubated PPARbeta antagonist GSK0660, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4 inhibitor dichloroacetate knockdown PPARbeta PDK4 siRNA. ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, ROS scavenger catalase, inhibitor complex II thenoyltrifluoroacetone uncoupler oxidative phosphorylation, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, also prevented glucose-induced insulin resistance. STZ diabetic rats, oral GW0742 also improved insulin signalling impaired NO-mediated vascular relaxation. CONCLUSION IMPLICATIONS: PPARbeta activation vitro vivo restores endothelial function, preserving insulin-Akt-eNOS pathway impaired high glucose, least part, PDK4 activation.
