 BACKGROUND: Tumor cells characterized accelerated growth usually accompanied up-regulated pathways ultimately increase rate ATP production. cells suffer metabolic reprogramming, resulting distinct bioenergetic phenotypes, generally enhancing glycolysis channeled lactate production. present work showed metabolic reprogramming means inhibitors histone deacetylase (HDACis), sodium butyrate trichostatin. treatment able shift energy metabolism activating mitochondrial systems respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation largely repressed untreated controls. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Various cellular biochemical parameters evaluated lung cancer H460 cells treated histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), sodium butyrate (NaB) trichostatin (TSA). NaB TSA reduced glycolytic flux, assayed lactate release H460 cells concentration dependent manner. NaB inhibited expression glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT 1), substantially increased mitochondria bound hexokinase (HK) activity. NaB induced increase HK activity associated isoform HK accompanied 1.5 fold increase HK mRNA expression cognate protein biosynthesis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) pyruvate kinase (PYK) activities unchanged HDACis suggesting increase HK activity coupled glycolytic flux. High resolution respirometry H460 cells revealed NaB-dependent increased rates oxygen consumption coupled ATP synthesis. Metabolomic analysis showed NaB altered glycolytic metabolite profile intact H460 cells. Concomitantly detected activation pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). high O(2) consumption NaB-treated cells shown unrelated mitochondrial biogenesis since citrate synthase (CS) activity amount mitochondrial DNA remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: NaB TSA induced increase mitochondrial function oxidative metabolism H460 lung tumor cells concomitant less proliferative cellular phenotype.
