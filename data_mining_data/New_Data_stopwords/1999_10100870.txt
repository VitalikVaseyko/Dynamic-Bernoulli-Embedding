 result Myc-dependent transcription LDH-A gene, Myc-transformed cells (Rat1-Myc) exhibit increased lactate production rates (LPR) even aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect). Recently, increased susceptibility stress-induced apoptosis associated Myc transfection linked overexpression LDH-A gene. report demonstrate overexpression anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 Rat1-Myc cells (Rat1-Myc-Bcl-2) reduces molar ratio lactate production glucose consumption (Y(L/G)). Bcl-2 induced reduction Y(L/G) may associated reduced expression LDH-A gene, decrease LDH-A activity. Stimulation apoptosis staurosporine, protein kinase C inhibitor, reduces LPR Rat1-Myc cells dose-dependent manner. staurosporine effect LPR rapid precedes execution phase apoptosis defined caspase activation PARP cleavage. effect LPR completely blocked Bcl-2 overexpression. Serum starvation alone affect LPR Rat1-Myc Rat1-Myc-Bcl-2 cells; however, effect staurosporine LPR Rat1-Myc cells potentiated serum starvation. data demonstrate Bcl-2 overexpression reduces Y(L/G) Rat1-Myc cells, perhaps via reduction activity expression LDH-A gene, reduction may desensitize cells pro-apoptotic stimuli. reduction LPR response staurosporine may early step induction apoptosis Rat1-Myc cells. abolishing reduction LPR, Bcl-2 may protect Rat1-Myc cells staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Moreover, lack effect serum starvation LPR supports model serum starvation induces apoptosis pathway distinct staurosporine glucose-dependent apoptotic pathway(s) Myc-transformed cells.
