 Glucose metabolism mechanisms NADH oxidation Treponema hyodysenteriae studied. N2 atmosphere, washed cell suspensions spirochete consumed glucose produced acetate, butyrate, H2, CO2. Approximately twice much H2 CO2 produced. Determinations radioactivity products [14C]glucose [14C]pyruvate metabolism analyses enzyme activities cell lysates revealed glucose catabolized pyruvate via Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. results pyruvate exchange reactions NaH14CO3 Na14COOH demonstrated pyruvate converted acetyl coenzyme (acetyl-CoA), H2, CO2 clostridium-type phosphoroclastic mechanism. NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase hydrogenase activities present cell lysates produced H2 NADH oxidation. Phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase catalyzed formation acetate acetyl-CoA. Butyrate formed acetyl-CoA via pathway involved 3-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme (CoA) dehydrogenase, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, butyryl-CoA transferase. T. hyodysenteriae cell suspensions generated less H2 butyrate 10% O2-90% N2 100% N2. Cell lysates contained NADH oxidase, NADH peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities. findings indicated three major mechanisms T. hyodysenteriae cells use recycle NADH generated Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway--enzymes pathway acetyl-CoA butyrate, NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, NADH oxidase. Versatility methods NADH oxidation ability metabolize oxygen could benefit T. hyodysenteriae cells colonization tissues swine large bowel.
