 concept ouabain-sensitive membrane (Na+ + K+)-ATPase-generated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) preferentially serves substrate phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) step erythrocyte glycolysis reexamined. Membrane ATPase readily provides ADP utilizes ATP generated pyruvate kinase (PK) step ouabain sensitive. Earlier reports literature, suggested hemolysates ATPase reaction facilitating PK reaction ouabain-insensitive, reinterpreted: crude hemolysates ADP generated "backward" PGK reaction account data. conclude convincing evidence selective linkage (Na+ + K+)-ATPase PGK reaction.
