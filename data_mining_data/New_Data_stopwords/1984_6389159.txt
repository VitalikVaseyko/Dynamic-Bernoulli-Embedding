 article considers recent evidence concerning molecular mechanisms involved coordinate regulation gene expression red blood cell (RBC) differentiation. Contrary popular belief, recent evidence shows characteristic RBC proteins restricted erythroid lineage: apart globins, RBC lipoxygenase (possibly) glycophorin examples reasonably good evidence. contrast, proteins forming RBC cytoskeleton (spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.1, actin possibly major anion exchange transmembrane protein cytoskeleton attached plasma membrane) closely-related variants cell types. Yet two beta-spectrin variants found exclusively certain terminally differentiated cells, often certain specific regions cell membrane. Certain RBC isozymes (e.g. pyruvate kinase carbonic anhydrase) RBC 19 kD protein (ep19) also expressed subset cell types. illustrates importance gene families differentially regulated certain subsets cell types differentiation development. expression globin genes seems regulated mainly transcriptional level, although transport transcripts cytoplasm may controlled interactions RNAs: stabilisation globin mRNAs ribonucleoprotein complexes cytoplasm may also important. fact, expression globin genes involves two distinct phases: first, structural changes occur chromatin surrounding genes (as determined sensitivity digestion nucleases) maintained independently subsequent transcription. many cases, nuclease-sensitive sites chromatin correspond low-level transcription initiation sites DNA sequences regulatory functions isolated genes assayed transcription vivo transfection cells. unlinked alpha- beta-globin genes coordinately regulated yet understood. Indeed, alpha- beta-gene promoters quite different properties judged responses DNA replication factors known affect viral gene function (e.g. cis-acting SV40 enhancer elements trans-acting adenovirus regulatory protein, Ela). evidence shows nuclear protein present erythroid cells able bind beta-globin gene precisely region hypersensitive nuclease digestion chromatin erythroid cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
