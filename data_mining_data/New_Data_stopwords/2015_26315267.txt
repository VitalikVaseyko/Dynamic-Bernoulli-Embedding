 high proliferation rate cancer cells microenvironment tumor tissue require reprogramming tumor cell metabolism. major mechanism metabolic reprogramming cancer cells Warburg effect, defined preferential utilization glucose via glycolysis even presence oxygen. Targeting Warburg effect considered promising therapeutic strategy cancer therapy. regard, glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) evaluated clinically. 2DG exerts effect directly inhibiting glycolysis level hexokinase phosphoglucoisomerase. addition, 2DG also known induce expression thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), tumor suppressor protein important negative regulator cellular glucose uptake. Hence, characterization mechanism 2DG regulates TXNIP expression may reveal novel approaches target Warburg effect cancer cells. Therefore, study sought test various hypotheses mechanistic basis 2DG dependent TXNIP regulation. shown 2DG induced TXNIP expression independent carbohydrate response element mediated transcription. Furthermore, induction TXNIP neither dependent ability 2DG deplete cellular ATP cause endoplasmic reticulum stress. found 2DG induced TXNIP expression least part dependent inhibition O-GlcNAcase enzyme accumulation O-GlcNAc modified proteins. results implications identification therapeutic targets increase TXNIP expression cancer.
