 Warburg micro syndrome (WARBM) genetically heterogeneous syndrome linked least 4 loci. clinical level, WARBM characterized microcephaly, microphthalmia, microcornea, congenital cataracts, corpus callosum hypoplasia, severe mental retardation, hypogonadism. families additional clinical features reported. presence uncommon clinical features (peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy) may result misdirected molecular diagnostics. Using next generation sequencing approach (NGS), able diagnose WARBM1 syndrome detection new mutation within RAB3GAP1 gene. detected DNA variants may responsible cardiomyopathy. find obvious pathogenic mutation within set genes known responsible hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN). conclude that: (i) clinically delineated syndromes, classical single-gene oriented approach may conclusive especially presence rare clinical features, (ii) peripheral neuropathy cardiomyopathy rare additional symptoms coexisting WARBM1, (iii) pleiotropic effect single point mutation sufficient causative WARBM1 (iv) WARBM-affected patients reported delineate complete phenotype.
