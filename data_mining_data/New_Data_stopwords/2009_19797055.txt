 biochemical mechanisms underlying glucose-stimulated insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells completely understood. identify metabolic disturbances beta-cells impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, compared two INS-1-derived clonal beta-cell lines, glucose-responsive (832/13 cells) glucose-unresponsive (832/2 cells). end, analyzed number parameters glycolytic mitochondrial metabolism, including mRNA expression genes involved cellular energy metabolism. found despite marked impairment glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, 832/2 cells exhibited higher rate glycolysis. Still, glucose-induced increases respiratory rate, ATP production, respiratory chain complex I, III, IV activities seen 832/2 cells. Instead, 832/2 cells, expressed lactate dehydrogenase A, released lactate regardless ambient glucose concentrations. contrast, glucose-responsive 832/13 line lacked lactate dehydrogenase produce lactate. Accordingly, 832/2 cells mRNA expression genes glycolytic enzymes up-regulated, whereas mitochondria-related genes down-regulated. could account Warburg-like effect 832/2 cell clone, lacking 832/13 cells well primary beta-cells. human islets, mRNA expression genes lactate dehydrogenase hexokinase correlated positively HbA(1c) levels, reflecting perturbed long term glucose homeostasis, whereas Slc2a2 (glucose transporter 2) correlated negatively HbA(1c) thus better metabolic control. conclude tight metabolic regulation enhancing mitochondrial metabolism restricting glycolysis 832/13 cells required clonal beta-cells secrete insulin robustly response glucose. Moreover, similar expression pattern genes controlling glycolytic mitochondrial metabolism clonal beta-cells human islets observed, suggesting similar prioritization mitochondrial metabolism required healthy human beta-cells. 832 beta-cell lines may helpful tools resolve metabolic perturbations occurring Type 2 diabetes.
