 lead acetate administered intraperitoneally young rats dose 20 mg/kg (five times week 6 weeks), growth rate retarded compared controls injected sodium acetate. small amount heavy metal reached circulation exerted limited effects typical target organs. However, large, electron-dense inclusion bodies found abdominal cavity. vivo intestinal absorption glucose reduced. perfused 40 mM concentration, experimental animals mean absorption rate 152.1 nmol/min . cm vs. 230.6 controls (p less 0.01). Also, sodium potassium transport reduced. effects observed amino acid transport (Na+-K+)-ATPase. Mg++-ATPase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, succinic dehydrogenase, tryptophan hydroxylase small intestinal mucosa kidney unaltered. Renal alkaline phosphatase decreased. studies confirm greater susceptibility active transport mechanisms small intestinal mucosa lead toxicity, compared kidney.
