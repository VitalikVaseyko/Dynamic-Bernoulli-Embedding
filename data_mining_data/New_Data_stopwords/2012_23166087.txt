 BACKGROUND: experimental study explores novel magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopic (MRI/MRS) method measures changes renal metabolism diabetic rat model. hyperpolarized metabolic MRI/MRS method allows monitoring metabolic processes seconds >10 000-fold enhancement MR signal. method shown conversion pyruvate bicarbonate, i.e. pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, significantly altered myocardium already onset diabetes, predominant Warburg effect valuable cancer maker via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. hypothesize similar change PDH LDH could found early diabetic kidney. METHODS: streptozotocin rat model type 1 diabetes, hyperpolarized (13) C-MRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (1) H-MRI employed investigate changes renal metabolism diabetic control kidneys vivo. RESULTS: diabetic kidney showed 149% increase lactate/pyruvate ratio compared control rat kidney, whereas bicarbonate/pyruvate ratio unchanged diabetic control rat kidneys, consistent literature findings. metabolic findings paralleled reduced intrarenal oxygen availability found blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI. DISCUSSION: Hyperpolarized (13) C-MRI shows promise diagnosis monitoring early renal changes associated diabetes, pyruvate/lactate ratio imaging biomarker regional renal changes.
