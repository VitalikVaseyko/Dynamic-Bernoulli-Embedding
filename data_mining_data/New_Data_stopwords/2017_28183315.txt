 BACKGROUND: Metabolic alterations play role development inflammatory myopathies (IMs). Herein, investigated multiplex assay whether proteins energy metabolism could provide biomarkers IMs. METHODS: cohort thirty-two muscle biopsies forty plasma samples comprising polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) control donors interrogated monoclonal antibodies proteins energy metabolism using reverse phase protein microarrays (RPPA). RESULTS: compared controls expression proteins significantly affected muscle PM patients. However, expression beta-actin significantly increased DM sIBM consistence muscle fiber regeneration. Concurrently, expression proteins involved glucose metabolism displayed significant reduction muscle sIBM suggesting repression glycolytic metabolism patients. contrasts findings, expression glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) mitochondrial ATPase Inhibitor Factor 1 (IF1) Hsp60 significantly augmented DM compared IMs accordance metabolic shift prone cancer development. PKM2 alone combination biomarkers allowed discrimination control IMs high (>95%) sensitivity specificity. Unfortunately, plasma levels PKM2 significantly altered DM patients recommend use non-invasive biomarker disease. CONCLUSIONS: Expression proteins energy metabolism muscle enabled discrimination patients IMs. RPPA identified glycolysis promoting PKM2 IF1 proteins specific biomarkers dermatomyositis, providing biochemical link IM oncogenesis.
