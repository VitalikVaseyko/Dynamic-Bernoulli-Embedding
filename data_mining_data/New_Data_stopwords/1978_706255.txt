 Metabolic activity rat lungs studied normal state acute hypoxia, caused effect rarefied atmosphere (3 hrs, "height" 10,000 m). Glycolytic splitting carbohydrates catabolism proteins increased lungs hypoxic stress. hypoxia activities adlobase, pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase, 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase increased, hexokinase activity decreased. Activities lipase, lactate dehydrogenase NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase altered, whereas ratio specific activity cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase decreased.
