 Succinic acid important platform chemical synthesis C4 compounds. applied genome shuffling improve fermentative production succinic acid A. succinogenes. Using screening strategy composed selection fermentation broth, cultured 96-deep-well plates, condensed HPLC screening, starting population 11 mutants producing higher succinic acid concentration selected subjected recursive protoplasts fusion. three rounds genome shuffling, strain F3-II-3-F obtained, producing succinic acid 1.99 g/l/h yield 95.6 g/l. genome shuffled strain 73 % improvement succinic acid production compared parent strain 48 h fed-batch fermentation. genomic variability F3-II-3-F confirmed amplified fragment-length polymorphism. activity levels key enzymes involved end-product formation glucose metabolic flux distribution succinic acid production compared A. succinogenes CGMCC 1593 F3-II-3-F. Increased activity glucokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, PEP carboxykinase fumarase, well decreased activity pyruvate kinase, pyruvate formate-lyase, acetate kinase explained enhanced succinic acid production decreased acetic acid formation. Metabolic flux analysis suggested increased flux NADH main reason increased activity C4 pathway resulting increased yields succinic acid. present work propitious development bio-succinic acid fermentation industry.
