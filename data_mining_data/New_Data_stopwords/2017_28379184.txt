 Phloroglucinol phenolic compound one major compounds Ecklonia cava (brown alga). many pharmacological activities, anti-diabetic effect yet fully explored. study, investigated effect phloroglucinol control blood glucose levels regulation hepatic glucose production. Phloroglucinol significantly improved glucose tolerance male C57BL/6J mice fed high fat diet (HFD) inhibited glucose production mouse primary hepatocytes. expression phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA protein (G6Pase), enzymes involved gluconeogenesis, inhibited liver tissue phloroglucinol-treated mice phloroglucinol-treated HepG2 cells. addition, phloroglucinol treatment increased phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)alpha HepG2 cells. Treatment compound C, AMPKalpha inhibitor, inhibited increase phosphorylated AMPKalpha decrease PEPCK G6Pase expression caused phloroglucinol treatment. conclude phloroglucinol may inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis via modulating AMPKalpha signaling pathway, thus lower blood glucose levels.
