 influence pH upon O(2) inhibition (14)CO(2) photoassimilation (Warburg effect) examined intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts. conditions favored Warburg effect, i.e. rate-limiting CO(2) 100% O(2), O(2) inhibition greater pH 8.4 8.5 pH 7.5 7.8. pH 8.5, compared 7.8, enhanced (14)C-labeling glycolate, decrease isotope phosphorylated Calvin cycle intermediates, particularly triose-phosphate. (14)C-labeling starch also inhibited O(2) higher pH. enhanced synthesis glycolate (14)CO(2) assimilation higher pH resulted diminution level phosphorylated intermediates Calvin cycle, apparently causal factor increased severity Warburg effect.The (14)C-labeling profiles interpreted terms "CO(2)"-sensitive well "CO(2)"-insensitive mechanism glycolate synthesis. mechanisms functioned optimally higher pH responded O(2).
