 1. regulatory properties phosphofructokinase (PFK) investigated two cellular population representatives trout haemopoiesis; haemopoietic cells (capable replication differentiation) erythrocytes (highly specialized cells). 2. intracellular levels substrates effectors quantified effect PFK activity determined. 3. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate anc cyclic AMP show higher activation PFK haemopoietic cells enzyme erythrocytes. 4. AMP phosphoenolpyruvate act activators haemopoietic cell PFK erythrocytes PFK, AMP inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate display effect. 5. Citrate inhibits PFK activity haemopoietic cells assayed erythrocytes since detected cells. 6. differences PFK regulation cellular populations may attributed intracellular levels effectors and/or different isoenzymatic patterns. 7. different regulation PFK together higher enzymatic activity PFK pyruvate kinase haemopoietic cells related higher glycolytic flux exhibits haemopoietic cells. 8. results shown investigation allow us conclude PFK specific role depending energetic requirements cellular population enzyme present. 9. requirements related physiological function type cell.
