 Bovine type pyruvate kinase, normally hyperbolic kinetics substrates, inactivated treatment trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. inactivation probably occurs trinitrophenylation epsilon-amino group lysine residue near ADP binding site. Although 90 95% enzymatic activity lost treatment, molecular weight sedimentation coefficient trinitrophenylated enzyme quite similar values obtained native enzyme. inactivated, trinitrophenylated type pyruvate kinase hybridized vitro native bovine type L enzyme, sigmoidal kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate activated fructose 1,6-diphosphate give hyperbolic kinetics. Four enzymatically active species produced, designated L4, L3M, L2M2, LM3, according subunit composition. L4 L3M sigmoidal kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate activated fructose diphosphate. Little sigmoidicity seen L2M2, although species activated moderate degree fructose diphosphate. LM3 appears hyperbolic kinetics activated slightly fructose diphosphate. kinetic results obtained hybrids containing trinitrophenylated type subunits quite similar results previously reported Dyson Cardenas ((1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 8482-8488) using native type type L subunits, indicating properties type L subunit profoundly affected nature subunits present tetramer. fact, type L type subunits given hybrid seem similar kinetic responses toward phosphoenolpyruvate fructose diphosphate.
