 Plasma thylakoid membranes prepared purified cyanobacteria Anacystis nidulans (Synechococcus PCC6301), Synechocystis PCC6803, Anabaena PCC7120 grown photoautotrophically axenic batch cultures harvested either early exponential growth (< 1 microliter packed cell mass/ml medium; light-saturated cells) linear growth (2-3 microliters packed cell mass/ml medium; light-limited cells). ATPase activities methanol-activated membranes determined measuring (a) total inorganic phosphate released added ATP, (b) 32P(i) released added [gamma-32P] ATP, (c) NADH oxidation coupled ATPase/pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system. addition, membrane proteins immunoblotted antibodies raised chloroplast mitochondrial F1 coupling factor beta subunits, Arabidopsis plasma membrane (P-type) ATPase, respectively. results indicate presence (constitutive) P-type ATPase, inhibited dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCCD), o-vanadate diethylstilbestrol (DES) insensitive 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD), (inducible) F-type ATPase, inhibited DCCD NBD insensitive o-vanadate DES, plasma membrane. Thylakoid membranes hand contain F-type ATPase only. results emphasize importance plasma membrane energization even obligately phototrophic cyanobacteria.
