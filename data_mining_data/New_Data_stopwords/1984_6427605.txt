 vitro biochemical characteristics three strains Haemonchus contortus, benzimidazole-susceptible, mebendazole-resistant thiabendazole-resistant isolates, investigated. Steady-state pool sizes glucose metabolic intermediates, including adenine nucleotides end-products revealed differences adult worms resistant susceptible benzimidazoles 30-60 min incubations. Possible regulatory steps glycolytic pathway identified involving enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. major component carbohydrate reserves trehalose, glycogen present glucose pool small. incubation 18 h vitro, carbohydrates metabolised three strains. However, benzimidazole-susceptible worms preferential use glycogen reserves maintain energy metabolism. three strains similar levels total lipid, total protein free amino acid change incubation. major products found medium incubation, vitro, 18 h propionate, acetate propanol, smaller amounts ethanol, lactate malate. three strains produced similar sum total end-products; however, mebendazole-resistant strain appeared diversion carbon flow ethanol-producing pathway. Carbon dioxide production 60 min incubations measured using radioactively labelled glucose. greater output labelled CO2 noted aerobic anaerobic conditions. particularly true mebendazole-resistant strain and, strain, sensitive cyanide. extent metabolic differences noted three strains may related benzimidazole resistance readily apparent.
