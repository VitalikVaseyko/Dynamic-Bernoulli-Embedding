 Two green macroalgae, Codium decorticatum Udotea flabellum, differ photosynthetically. Codium high O(2)-sensitive, Udotea low O(2)-insensitive, CO(2) compensation points; Codium showed Warburg effect seawater dissolved inorganic carbon levels photorespiratory CO(2) release, whereas Udotea not. Seawater dissolved inorganic carbon levels saturate photosynthesis. Codium, Udotea, Warburg effect increased ethoxyzolamide, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, high low pH. Isolated chloroplasts macroalgae showed Warburg effect ethoxyzolamide-insensitive. macroalgae, chloroplastic extrachloroplastic carbonic anhydrase activity present. P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) carboxylating activity Udotea extracts equivalent ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, enzyme activities C(4) acid metabolism P-enolpyruvate regeneration sufficient operate limited C(4)-like system. Udotea, malate aspartate early-labeled photosynthetic products turned within 60 seconds. Photorespiratory compounds much less labeled Udotea. Low dark fixation rates ruled Crassulacean acid metabolism. limited C(4)-like system, based PEPCK, hypothesized mechanism reducing photorespiration Udotea. Codium showed evidence photosynthetic C(4) acid metabolism. Marine macroalgae, like terrestrial angiosperms, seem diverse photosynthetic modes.
