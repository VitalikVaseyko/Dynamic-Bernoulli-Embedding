 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) important gatekeeper enzyme connecting glycolysis tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Thereby, strong impact glycolytic flux well metabolic phenotype cell. PDC activity regulated via reversible phosphorylation three serine residues pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1alpha subunit. Phosphorylation residues PDH kinases (PDKs) leads strong decrease PDC activity. hypoxia, inactivation PDC described dependent hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-induced PDK1 protein upregulation. study, show two hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 JHH-4) that, adaptation hypoxia, PDH already phosphorylated time points preceding HIF-1-mediated transcriptional events PDK1 protein upregulation. Using siRNAs small molecule inhibitor approaches, show inactivation PDC independent HIF-1alpha expression PDKs need expressed active. Furthermore, show reactive oxygen species might important induction PDH phosphorylation since correlates appearance altered redox state mitochondria also inducible H2O2 treatment normoxic conditions. Overall, results show neither HIF-1 expression PDK1 upregulation necessary phosphorylation PDH first hours adaptation hypoxia.
