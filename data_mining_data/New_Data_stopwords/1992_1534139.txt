 novel mutation, FruS localised fru operon obtained. uncouples expression genes determining synthesis fructose-specific transport proteins fructose-1-phosphate kinase. FruS bacteria fruA fruF genes (coding Enzyme IIfru FPr, respectively) constitutive expressed fruK (encoding fructose-1-phosphate kinase) remains inducible. contrast mutations, render expression whole fru operon constitutive, FruS mutation: (1) lead D-xylitol sensitivity; (2) inhibit growth D-lactate, pyruvate L-alanine; (3) decrease phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) synthase activity.
