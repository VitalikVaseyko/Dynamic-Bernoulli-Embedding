 Bioenergetic profiling tumors new challenge cancer research medicine therapies currently developed. Meanwhile, methodological means must proposed gather information tumor metabolism order adapt potential therapies bioenergetic specificities tumors. Studies performed tumors cancer cell lines shown cancer cells bioenergetics highly variable. profile changes microenvironmental conditions (eg. substrate availability), oncogenes activated (and tumor suppressors inactivated) interaction stroma (i.e. reverse Warburg effect). Here, assessed power metabolic footprinting (MFP) unravel bioenergetics associated anabolic changes induced three oncogenes, c-Myc, KLF4 Oct1. MFP approach provides quantitative analysis metabolites secreted consumed cancer cells. used ultra performance liquid chromatography quantifying amino acid uptake secretion. investigate potential oncogene-mediated alterations mitochondrial metabolism, measured oxygen consumption rate ATP production well glucose uptake lactate release. findings show c-Myc deficiency initiates Warburg effect along reduction mitochondrial respiration. KLF4 deficiency also stimulated glycolysis, albeit without cellular respiration impairment. contrast, Oct1 deficiency reduced glycolysis enhanced oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. MFP revealed c-Myc, KLF4 Oct1 altered amino acid metabolism specific patterns. identified isoleucine, alpha-aminoadipic acid GABA (gamma-aminoisobutyric acid) biomarkers related. findings establish impact Oct1, KLF4 c-Myc cancer bioenergetics evidence link oncosecretomics cellular bioenergetics profile.
