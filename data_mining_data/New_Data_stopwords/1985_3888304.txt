 Previously, demonstrated parallel most-dense (bouyant density) sickle erythrocyte subpopulations most-dense aged normal red cells organization membrane components intact cell. present study addressed possibility corresponding similarity may exist most-dense sickled red cell subpopulations aged normal erythrocytes development membrane protein components function receptors autologous immunoglobulin (Ig). Autologous IgG retained density-fractionated erythrocytes estimated nonequilibrium 125I-protein (Staphylococcus aureus) binding assay. Results show most-dense sickle cell fractions contain (2.7-fold 1.8-fold, P less .005) cell-bound IgG comparison younger sickle erythrocyte fractions sedimenting low density. Parallel findings obtained similar analyses normal (homozygous-A) erythrocyte fractions. Detection presence specific IgG also carried direct binding fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human IgG density-separated red cell fractions followed analyses fluorescent cell populations flow cytometry. Results showed significantly higher levels IgG bound most-dense (12.1% +/- 2.5% 8.8% +/- 0.5%-) sickle red cell subpopulations (P less .005) comparison younger sickle erythrocyte fractions sedimenting low densities (3.8% +/- 0.32% 4.7% +/- 1.6% IgG-positive red cell subpopulation). results indicate membrane changes occur 120 days normal red cells also apparent chronologically younger (life span vivo, ten 40 days) sickle erythrocyte. increased retention IgG most-dense irreversibly sickled cell-enriched fractions comparison least-dense reversibly sickled cells pre-irreversibly sickled erythrocyte fractions, suggests alterations topography sickle cell membrane transformation vivo most-dense irreversibly sickled cell morphology may produce unmasking cryptic antigenic sites. addition, findings may indicate opsonization specific erythrocyte subpopulations may play role pathophysiology sickle cell disease.
