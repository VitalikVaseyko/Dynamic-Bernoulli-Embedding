 onset exercise, signals inside outside muscle cell increase availability carbohydrate (CHO) fat provide fuel required ATP production. CHO fat oxidation dominant sources aerobic ATP production pathways must heavily upregulated exercise meet increased energy demand. Within paradigm, room shifts proportion energy provided CHO fat. long known increasing availability endogenous exogenous CHO increase oxidation CHO decrease oxidation fat. opposite also true. descriptive studies documenting changes numerous, mechanisms regulating shifts fuel use face constant energy demand thoroughly elucidated. would expected, example, fat-induced shift CHO metabolism would target enzymes play key roles regulating CHO metabolism oxidation. Inside muscle could include glucose uptake (GLUT4) phosphorylation (hexokinase), glycogenolysis (glycogen phosphorylase), glycolysis (phosphofructokinase) conversion acetyl CoA (pyruvate dehydrogenase). would expected CHO-induced regulation fat metabolism oxidation might target transport long chain fatty acids cell (fatty acid translocase CD36), release fatty acids intramuscular triacylglycerol (hormone sensitive lipase) transport mitochondria (carnitine palmitoyl transferase complex). review summarizes work describing interaction CHO fat metabolism human skeletal muscle exercise presents theories may account CHO/fat interaction exercise.
