 better understanding molecular pathways involved malignant transformation head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) essential development novel efficient anti-cancer drugs. delineate global metabolism HNSCC, report (1)H NMR-based metabolic profiling HNSCC cells five different patients derived various sites upper aerodigestive tract, including floor mouth, tongue larynx. Primary cultures normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) three different donors used comparison. (1)H NMR spectra polar non-polar extracts cells used identify thirty-five metabolites. Principal component analysis performed NMR data revealed clear classification NHOK HNSCC cells. HNSCC cells exhibited significantly altered levels various metabolites clearly revealed dysregulation multiple metabolic events, including Warburg effect, oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, TCA cycle anaplerotic flux, glutaminolysis, hexosamine pathway, osmo-regulatory anti-oxidant mechanism. addition, significant alterations ratios phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine, elevated arachidonic acid observed HNSCC cells reveal altered membrane choline phospholipid metabolism (MCPM). Furthermore, significantly increased activity phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), particularly cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) observed HNSCC cells confirm altered MCPM. summary, metabolomic findings presented useful elucidate biological aspects lead HNSCC, also provide rational basis monitoring molecular mechanisms response chemotherapy. Moreover, cPLA(2) may serve potential therapeutic target anti-cancer therapy HNSCC.
