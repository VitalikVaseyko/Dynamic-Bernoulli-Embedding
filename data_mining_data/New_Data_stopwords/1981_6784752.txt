 K4 M4 isozymes mouse pyruvate kinase purified homogeneity, physical, chemical, kinetic properties compared. K isozyme slightly larger, high degree homology exists evidenced similar amino acid composition, immunotitration value, two-dimensional arginine peptide pattern tryptic digestion. Also, active conformational form K isozyme kinetic chromatographic properties similar isozyme. K subunit could extracted antibody fresh spleen extracts, subunit cleaved form product mobility subunit. cleavage accomplished endogenous enzyme appears first step K-enzyme degradation. product called Kpm . KpmK hybrid could also purified homogeneity. enzyme structure K2pmK2, types subunit activity. Kpm form higher K0.5S value phosphoenolpyruvate lower K0.5S value ADP either K type. However, Kpm subunits otherwise similar properties speculated Kpm subunit M-type precursor.
