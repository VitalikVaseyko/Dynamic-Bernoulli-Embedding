 association tomato yellow leaf curl geminivirus (TYLCV, Israeli isolate) insect vector, whitefly Bemisia tabaci, investigated. Insects emerged 24 h period caged TYLCV-infected plants 48 h acquisition access period, egg-plants--a TYLCV non-host--for rest lives. TYLCV DNA associated whiteflies entire adult life, amount capsid protein rapidly decreased detectable insect approximately 12 days age. ability infected whiteflies transmit TYLCV tomato test plants steadily decreased age disappear completely. Transmission viruliferous insects decreased 100% 10-20% adult lifetime, compared decrease 100% 50% non-viruliferous insects. association TYLCV adult B. tabaci led reduction 17-23% life expectancy compared insects acquired virus, 40-50% decrease mean number eggs laid. results suggest TYLCV features reminiscent insect pathogen.
