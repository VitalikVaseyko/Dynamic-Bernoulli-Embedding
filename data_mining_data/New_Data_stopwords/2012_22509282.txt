 Erythrocyte cytosolic protein expression profiles children unexplained hemolytic anemia compared profiles close relatives controls two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). severity anemia patients varied compensated (i.e., medical intervention required) chronic transfusion dependence. Common characteristics patients included chronic elevation reticulocyte count negative workup anemia focusing hemoglobinopathies, morphologic abnormalities would suggest membrane defect, immune-mediated red cell destruction, evaluation common red cell enzyme defects, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase deficiency. Based upon initial workup presentation infancy early childhood, four patients classified hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) unknown etiology selected proteomic analysis. DIGE analysis red cell cytosolic proteins clearly discriminated anemic patient familial unrelated controls, revealing patient-specific shared patterns differential protein expression. Changes expression pattern shared among four patients identified several protein classes including chaperons, cytoskeletal proteasome proteins. Elevated expression patient samples proteins correlated high reticulocyte count, likely identifying subset proteins normally lost erythroid maturation, including proteins involved mitochondrial metabolism protein synthesis. Proteins identified patient-specific decreased expression included components glutathione synthetic pathway, antioxidant pathways, proteins involved signal transduction nucleotide metabolism. Among 200 proteins identified study 21 proteins previously described part erythrocyte proteome. results demonstrate feasibility applying global proteomic approach aid characterization red cells patients hereditary anemia unknown cause, including identification differentially expressed proteins potential candidates role disease pathogenesis.
