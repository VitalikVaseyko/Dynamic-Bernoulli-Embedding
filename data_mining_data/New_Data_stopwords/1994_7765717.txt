 Escherichia coli grown rich medium excreted acetate reused acetate. Using cloned genes plasmid temperature-sensitive replication origin, three kinds Pta-Ack pathway deletion mutants constructed. Acetate production reuse wild-type cells grown rich medium confirmed largely occur Pta-Ack pathway. deletion mutants gene encoding phosphotransacetylase secreted pyruvate secretion acetate medium. deletion mutant gene encoding acetate kinase grew slow rate, secretion use acetate rapid. results indicated pathway(s), Pta-Ack pathway, functions control excess carbon flow mutants.
