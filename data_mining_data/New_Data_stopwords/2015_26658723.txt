 elucidate little-known bioenergetic pathways host immune cells tuberculosis, granulomatous disease caused intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, characterized infected murine lung tissue transcriptomic profiling confocal imaging. Transcriptomic analysis revealed changes host energy metabolism course infection characterized upregulation key glycolytic enzymes transporters glucose uptake, downregulation enzymes participating tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent elevated glycolysis, also observed upregulation transporter lactate secretion V type H(+) -ATPase involved cytosolic pH homeostasis. Transcription profiling results corroborated immunofluorescence microscopy showing increased expression key glycolytic enzymes macrophages cells granulomatous lesions. Moreover, found increased mRNA protein levels macrophages cells hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), regulatory subunit HIF-1, master transcriptional regulator. Thus, findings suggest immune cells predominantly utilize aerobic glycolysis response M. tuberculosis infection. bioenergetic shift similar Warburg effect, metabolic signature cancer cells. Finding immunometabolic changes M. tuberculosis infection opens way new strategies immunotherapy tuberculosis.
