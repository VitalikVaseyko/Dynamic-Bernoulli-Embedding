 Branched-chain amino acid metabolism skeletal muscle promotes production alanine, important precursor hepatic gluconeogenesis. controversy concerning origin carbon skeleton alanine produced muscle, specifically whether derived carbohydrate via glycolysis (the glucose-alanine cycle) amino acid precursors (viz. glutamate, valine, isoleucine, methionine, aspartate, asparagine) via pathway involving phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase pyruvate kinase, NADP-malate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme). relevant literature reviewed concluded neogenic flux amino acids unlikely major quantitative importance provision carbon skeleton alanine either vitro vivo. Evidence presented branched-chain amino acid oxidation muscle incomplete branched-chain 2-oxo acids products partial oxidation (including glutamine) released. role metabolites discussed context fuel homeostasis starvation.
