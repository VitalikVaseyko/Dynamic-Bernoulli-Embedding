 Determinations erythrocyte enzyme scavengers oxygen radicals (glutathione-peroxidase, superoxide-dismutase catalase) determinations erythrocyte age-dependent glycolytic activities (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, pyruvate-kinase glucose-phosphate-isomerase) carried cord blood blood taken 4th day life 152 newborn infants different peak bilirubin levels. enzyme activities scavenging oxygen radicals, glutathione-peroxidase superoxide-dismutase significantly lower infants peak bilirubinemia higher 214 mumol/l, compared less-jaundiced neonates, birth 4th day life; values correlated negatively peak bilirubinemia birth 4th day life. Glycolytic age-dependent enzyme activities significantly higher jaundiced newborn infants 4th day life, values correlated positively peak bilirubinemia. results investigation suggest deficiency factors protecting oxygen toxicity, may play role development neonatal hemolysis jaundice.
