 Confocal laser fluorescence microscopy used study real time nearly physiological conditions equilibration exchange characteristics several different fluorescently labeled molecules chemically skinned, unfixed skeletal muscle fibers rabbit psoas. time required equilibration found vary widely minutes several days. Specific interactions molecules myofibrillar structures seem slow equilibration significantly. Time equilibration, therefore, cannot simply predicted diffusion parameters solution. Specific interactions resulted characteristic labeling patterns molecules like creatine kinase (muscle type), pyruvate kinase, actin-binding IgG, others. slowly equilibrating Rh-NEM-S1, changes affinity upon binding actin absence calcium subsequent slow cooperative activation, beginning free end filament H-zone, observed. presence calcium, however, binding Rh-NEM-S1 homogeneous along whole actin filament beginning equilibration. dissociation properties dynamic interactions analyzed using chase protocol. Even molecules bind rather high affinity removed applying extreme experimental conditions like Rh-phalloidine Rh-troponin could displaced easily unlabeled homologous molecules.
