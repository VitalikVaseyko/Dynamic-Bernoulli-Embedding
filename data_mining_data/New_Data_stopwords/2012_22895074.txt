 Tumor-associated stroma (TAS) simply supporting element cancer cells, plays important role tumor growth, invasion metastasis. Changes level stromal constituents, loss Caveolin-1 increased thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression, associated tumor aggressiveness. mutual cooperation stromal fibroblasts cancer cells another distinguishing feature, recently emerged. investigation, loss Caveolin-1 increased TP expression prostatic TAS associated high Gleason score (p = 0.0002 0.003, respectively); two proteins acting independently synergistically. addition, TP significantly associated high stromal Ki-67 (MIB1) proliferation index (p = 0.03). Analysis metabolic interactions stromal epithelial elements showed that, prostatic cancer cells express principally (> 91%) lactate dehydrogenase-5 (LDH-5) (anaerobic metabolism), tumor-associated fibroblasts/myofibroblasts (TAFs) express largely (67.8%) LDH-1 (aerobic metabolism)-the terms TAFs TAS used interchangeably. two isoenzyme pathways act complementary; LDH-5 pathway converts pyruvate lactate, whereas LDH-1 enzyme system utilizes secreted metabolite lactate produce pyruvate, essential continuous energy supply tumor cells. Monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1)-the main facilitator lactate uptake tumor cells, expressed exclusively prostate cancer cells related directly LDH-5 overexpression. findings support extend previous studies energy recycling aerobic stroma anaerobic cancer cells within framework Warburg effect.
