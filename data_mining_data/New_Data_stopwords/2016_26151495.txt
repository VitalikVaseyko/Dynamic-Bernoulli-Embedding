 Aberrant functionality cell cycle implicated pathology traumatic SCI. Although reported expressions various cell cycle related proteins altered significantly following SCI, detailed information subject remains largely unclear. embryonic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) important metabolic kinase aerobic glycolysis warburg effect, however, functions central nervous system (CNS) injury remains elusive. demonstrate PKM2 significantly upregulated western blot immunohistochemistry certain traumatic stimuli also induced translocation PKM2 nucleus astrocytes following spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, expression levels localization p-beta-catenin, p27, cyclin D1 PCNA correlated PKM2 SCI. vitro, also found PKM2 co-immunoprecipitation p-beta-catenin p27 respectively. Knockdown PKM2 apparently decreased level PCNA, cyclinD1, p27 primary astrocyte cells. Taken together, findings indicate nuclear translocation PKM2 promotes astrocytes proliferation SCI modulating cell cycle signaling. discoveries firstly uncovered role PKM2 spinal cord injury provided potential therapeutic target CNS injury repair.
