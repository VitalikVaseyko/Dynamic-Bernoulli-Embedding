 Although clustered DNA damages induced cells ionizing radiation induced artifactually DNA isolation, known formed unirradiated cells normal oxidative metabolism. Using high-sensitivity methods quantitative gel electrophoresis, electronic imaging, number average length analysis, found two radiosensitive human cell lines (TK6 WI-L2-NS) accumulated Fpg-oxidized purine clusters Nth-oxidized pyrimidine clusters Nfo-abasic clusters. However, four repair-proficient human lines (MOLT 4, HL-60, WTK1, 28SC) contain significant levels (<5/Gbp) cluster type. Cluster levels independent p53 status. Measurement glycosylase levels 28SC, TK6, WI-L2-NS cells suggested depressed hOGG1 hNth activities TK6 WI-L2-NS could related oxybase cluster accumulation. Thus, individuals DNA repair enzyme deficiencies could accumulate potentially cytotoxic mutagenic clustered DNA damages. absence Nfo-detected endogenous clusters cells examined suggests abasic clusters could signature cellular ionizing radiation exposure.
