 Quinolinic acid (QA) shown evoke neurotoxic events via NMDA receptor (NMDAR) overactivation oxidative stress. NMDARs particularly vulnerable free radicals, modulate protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities. src family tyrosine kinases associated NMDAR complex regulate NMDA channel function. QA NMDAR agonist well pro-oxidant agent, investigated whether may affect activity PTKs PTPs vivo vitro. synaptosomes prepared striata dissected 15 min, 30 min 15 days bilateral injection QA observed modulation phosphotyrosine pattern; significant decrease PTP activity; sustained increase c-src lyn activity 15 30 min treatment QA, followed decrease 2 weeks later. Striatal synaptosomes treated vitro QA showed time- dose-dependent modulation c-src lyn kinase activities. Moreover, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester, NMDAR antagonist d-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid pyruvate suppressed QA-induced modulation c-src activity. findings suggest novel feature QA regulating src kinase activity formation reactive radical species and/or NMDAR overactivation.
