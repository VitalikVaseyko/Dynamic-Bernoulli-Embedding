 Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) hyperglycemia impair insulin sensitivity vivo. may secondary stimulation adipose tissue lipolysis consequent increased circulating free fatty acids (FFAs). report neither TNF-alpha glucose alone pronounced effect lipolysis 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, combination TNF-alpha plus glucose markedly stimulates lipolysis. Glucose affect ability isoproterenol stimulate lipolysis. Alternative substrates acetate, pyruvate, lactate allow TNF-alpha effect. Mannose almost effective glucose; fructose marginally effective, galactose ineffective. effectiveness sugars corresponded production lactate, i.e., cells readily produced lactate glucose mannose, slightly fructose, galactose. ability TNF-alpha phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) ERK2 downregulate perilipin (which implicated lipolytic effect TNF-alpha) affected glucose. conclude lipolytic action TNF-alpha influenced glucose 3T3-L1 adipocytes. findings suggest glucose metabolism required lipolytic response TNF-alpha early signaling events. findings suggest novel mechanisms TNF-alpha hyperglycemia raise FFA levels induce insulin resistance.
