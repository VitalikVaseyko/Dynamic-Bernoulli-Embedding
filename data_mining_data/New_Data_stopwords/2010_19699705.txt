 constructed novel ATP amplification reactor using reciprocating-flow system increase number ATP amplification cycles without increase backpressure. previously reported continuous-flow ATP amplification system effectively quantitatively amplified ATP increased sensitivity quantitative bioluminescence assay. However, difficult increase number amplification cycles due backpressure system. addition immobilized adenylate kinase (ADK) pyruvate kinase (PK) columns increased backpressure, maximum number ATP amplification cycles within column durability 4. study, ATP amplification performed using reciprocating-flow system, 10 cycles ATP amplification could achieved without increase backpressure. result, ATP amplified 100-fold 10 cycles reciprocating flow. gradient ATP amplification approximately 1.76(N). backpressure columns 0.03 MPa 1-10 ATP amplification cycles, increases backpressure observed.
