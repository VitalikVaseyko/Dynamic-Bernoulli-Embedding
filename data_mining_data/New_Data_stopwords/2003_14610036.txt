 measured activity levels, oxygen consumption, metabolic enzyme activity, breathing frequency, heart rate blood chemistry variables juvenile green turtles exposed laboratory simulation subtropical winter summer temperatures (17-26 degrees C) photoperiod (10.25 h:13.75 h 14 h:10 h light:dark). activity level turtles significant effect oxygen consumption breathing frequency significant change activity level summer winter simulations. moderate 24-27% decrease oxygen consumption exposure winter conditions compared summer conditions, difference statistically significant. Likewise, statistically significant difference breathing frequency summer winter simulations. Exposure winter conditions result significant decrease activity aerobic enzyme citrate synthase. contrast, activities glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase significantly higher tissue collected exposure winter conditions compared summer conditions. Citrate synthase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase relatively low thermal dependence range assay temperatures (15-30 degrees C; Q10=1.44-1.69). Heart rate 46-48% lower winter simulation compared summer simulation, difference statistically significant. Exposure winter conditions resulted significant decrease plasma thyroxine plasma proteins significant increase plasma creatine phosphokinase hematocrit. Overall, results suggest green turtles relatively low thermal dependence metabolic rate range temperatures commonly experienced tropical subtropical latitudes, trait allows maintain activity year-round.
