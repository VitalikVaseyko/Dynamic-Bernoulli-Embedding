 Three four families nuclear genes encode different isoforms phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (PEPC): C4-specific, C3 etiolated, CAM root forms. C4 leaf PEPC encoded single gene (ppc) sorghum maize, multiple genes C4-dicot Flaveria trinervia. Selective expression ppc C4-mesophyll cells proposed due nuclear factors, DNA methylation distinct gene promoter. Deduced amino acid sequences C4-PEPC pinpoint phosphorylatable serine near N-terminus, C4-specific valine serine residues near C-terminus, conserved cysteine, lysine histidine residues PEP binding/catalytic sites. PEPC reaction, PEP bicarbonate first converted carboxyphosphate enolate pyruvate. Carboxyphosphate decomposes within active site Pi CO2, latter combining enolate form oxalacetate. Besides carboxylation, PEPC catalyzes HCO3 (-)-dependent hydrolysis PEP yield pyruvate Pi. Post-translational regulation PEPC occurs phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade vivo reversible enzyme oligomerization vitro. interrelation phosphorylation oligomerization enzyme clear. PEPC-protein kinase (PEPC-PK), enzyme responsible phosphorylation PEPC, studied extensively limited information available protein phosphatase 2A capable dephosphorylating PEPC. C4 ppc cloned expressed Escherichia coli well tobacco. transformed E. coli produced functional/phosphorylatable C4 PEPC transgenic tobacco plants expressed C3 C4 isoforms. Site-directed mutagenesis ppc indicates importance His(138), His(579) Arg(587) catalysis and/or substrate-binding E. coli enzyme, Ser(8) regulation sorghum PEPC. Important areas research C4 PEPC are: mechanism transduction light signal photoactivation PEPC-PK PEPC leaves, extensive use site-directed mutagenesis precisely identify key amino acid residues, changes quarternary structure PEPC vivo, high-resolution crystal structure, hormonal regulation PEPC expression.
