 review summarizes recent developments regulation human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) site-specific phosphorylation four kinases. Mutagenic analysis three phosphorylation sites human pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) showed site-independent mechanism phosphorylation well site-independent dephosphorylation three phosphorylation sites importance phosphorylation site inactivation E1. negative charge size group introduced site 1 involved human E1 inactivation. Mechanism inactivation E1 suggested site-specific. Phosphorylation site 1 affected E1 interaction lipoyl domain dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, whereas phosphorylation site 3 appeared closer thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-binding region affecting coenzyme interaction human E1. Four isoenzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) showed different specificity three phosphorylation sites E1. four PDKs phosphorylated sites 1 2 PDC different rates, PDK1 phosphorylated site 3. PDK2 maximally stimulated reduction/acetylation lipoyl groups E2. Presence multiple phosphorylation sites isoenzymes PDK important tissue-specific regulation PDC different physiological conditions.
