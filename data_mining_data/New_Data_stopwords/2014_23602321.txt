 Icotinib potent specific epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. study, reported icotinib antitumor activity human squamous cell carcinoma cell line A431 vitro. Meanwhile, adhesion fibronectin expression integrin alpha3 beta1 significantly reduced dose-dependent manner treatment icotinib. Moreover, icotinib induced cell cycle arrested affected expression various cell cycle related proteins squamous cancer cell line A431, whereas cause apoptosis. Furthermore, icotinib remarkably down-regulated phosphorylation protein kinase B (AKT) though blocking interaction 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) AKT A431 cells. Taken together, shown small molecular compound, icotinib, anti-squamous cell carcinoma activity vitro antitumor mechanism associated blockage interaction PDK1 AKT. results provide novel strategy anti-squamous cell carcinoma therapy.
