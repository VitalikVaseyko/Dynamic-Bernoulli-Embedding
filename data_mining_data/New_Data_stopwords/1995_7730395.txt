 heterogeneous nuclear RNP (hnRNP) A1 protein one major pre-mRNA/mRNA binding proteins eukaryotic cells one abundant proteins nucleus. localized nucleoplasm also shuttles nucleus cytoplasm. amino acid sequence A1 contains two RNP motif RNA-binding domains (RBDs) amino terminus glycine-rich domain carboxyl terminus. configuration, designated 2x RBD-Gly, representative perhaps largest family hnRNP proteins. Unlike nuclear proteins characterized far, A1 (and 2x RBD-Gly proteins) contain recognizable nuclear localization signal (NLS). found segment ca. 40 amino acids near carboxyl end protein (designated M9) necessary sufficient nuclear localization; attaching segment bacterial protein beta-galactosidase pyruvate kinase completely localized otherwise cytoplasmic proteins nucleus. RBDs another RNA binding motif found glycine-rich domain, RGG box, required A1 nuclear localization. M9 novel type nuclear localization domain contain sequences similar classical basic-type NLS. Interestingly, sequences similar M9 found nuclear RNA-binding proteins including hnRNP A2.
