 better define modifications liver gluconeogenesis citric acid cycle, Krebs' cycle, activity induced insulin deficiency effects metformin abnormalities, infused livers isolated postabsorptive starved normal streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats pyruvate lactate (labeled [3-13C]lactate) without simultaneous infusion metformin. Lactate pyruvate uptake glucose production calculated. 13C-labeling pattern liver glutamate used calculate, according Magnusson's model, relative fluxes Krebs' cycle gluconeogenesis. relative fluxes converted absolute values using substrate balances. normal rats, starvation increased gluconeogenesis, flux pyruvate carboxylase-phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PC-PEPCK), ratio PC pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) flux (P < 0.05); metformin induced moderate decrease PC:PDH ratio. Livers postabsorptive diabetic rats increased lactate pyruvate uptakes (P < 0.05); metabolic fluxes resembled starved control livers, increased gluconeogenesis flux PC-PEPCK. Starvation induced modifications diabetic group. Metformin decreased glucose output liver starved diabetic rats (P < 0.05). flux PC-PEPCK also pyruvate kinase decreased (P < 0.05) metformin groups diabetic rats. conclusion, insulin deficiency increased model diabetes gluconeogenesis enhanced uptake substrate increased flux PC-PEPCK; metformin decreased glucose production reducing flux PC-PEPCK.
