 Glioblastoma malignant type brain tumor, high invasiveness multiplication severely shortens patients' overall survival. embryonic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform highly expressed human cancer. used computational target gene prediction, vitro cell culture, immunoblotting, quantitative real-time PCR, ATP measurements, luciferase reporter assays, wound-healing assays, Transwell assays, RNA immunoprecipitation PCR, co-immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry tumor xenografts study regulation PKM2/beta-catenin axis glioma. PKM2 predicted potential target miR-338. MiR-338 downregulated high-grade gliomas due hypermethylation CpG islands promoter, ectopic expression miR-338 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion ATP generation. MiR-338 inhibited PKM2 expression binding 3' untranslated region PKM2, ultimately prevented binding PKM2 beta-catenin reduced T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor reporter gene transcriptional activity. MiR-338 also inhibited PKM2 expression, attenuated glioma growth prolonged survival animal model. results confirm miR-338, tumor suppressor, suppresses PKM2/beta-catenin axis downregulated glioblastoma. provides theoretical basis glioma-targeting therapy.
