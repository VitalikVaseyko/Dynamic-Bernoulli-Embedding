 capability gather organism wide data far outstripped ability understand it. Transforming large-scale data "better" cell requires tools integrate physiology environment. One tool large-scale mathematical models marry stoichiometry kinetics metabolic regulation control. straightforward determine stoichiometry (at least central pathways), kinetics roughly approximated need be. However, molecular details "metabolic wiring" managing cell often missing. Presented surrogate missing details based simple premise; evolutionary time, biological systems developed objective-based programs frugally manage gene expression enzyme activity. Mathematically, notion represented sets nonlinear control "management" problems which, solved parallel model balances, offer prediction gene expression enzyme activity modulated, absence specific mechanistic details. present model Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism, describing batch aerobic growth glucose, transcription, translation, activity gene products 45 genes "managed" using approach. model consists 122 species (metabolites, enzymes, mRNA pools, biomass) describes 46 reactions (17 reversible). model identified (kinetic parameters well management structure) metabolic flux ratio (METAFoR) analysis physiological measurements. Simulations pyruvate kinase knockout strain compared experiments shown model capable accurately capturing metabolic reprogramming resulting deletion. Analysis mRNA expression pattern, translational pattern enzyme activity pattern wild-type versus mutant indicates combination expression specific activity shifts responsible observed differences. first step toward large-scale physiological modeling, work important two ways. First, strengthens hypothesis unknown mechanism reasonably approximated using objective-based management criteria. Second, provides dynamic means couple large-scale analysis technologies physiology single-gene, single-protein level.
