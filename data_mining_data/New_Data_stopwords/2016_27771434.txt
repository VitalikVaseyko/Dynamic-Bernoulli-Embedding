 Dichloroacetate (DCA) several therapeutic applications based pharmacological property inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. DCA used treat inherited mitochondrial disorders result lactic acidosis, well pulmonary hypertension several different solid tumors, latter ability reverse Warburg effect cancer cells restore aerobic glycolysis. main clinically limiting toxicity reversible peripheral neuropathy. Although administration high doses rodents result liver cancer, evidence DCA human carcinogen. studied species, including humans, DCA interesting property inhibiting metabolism upon repeat dosing, resulting alteration pharmacokinetics. first step DCA metabolism conversion glyoxylate catalyzed glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), DCA mechanism-based inactivator. rate GSTZ1 inactivation DCA influenced age, GSTZ1 haplotype cellular concentrations chloride. effect DCA metabolism complicates selection effective dose minimal side effects.
