 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy provides direct, "on-line" monitor enzymatic reactions. Measurement enzymatic activity based fact infrared spectra reactants products enzymatic reaction usually different. Several examples given using enzymes pyruvate kinase, fumarase alcohol dehydrogenase. main advantage infrared method observes reaction interest directly, i.e., activity assay required convert progress reaction observable quantity.
