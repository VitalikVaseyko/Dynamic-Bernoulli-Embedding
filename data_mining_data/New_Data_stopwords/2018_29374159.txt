 Cancer cells predominantly produce energy high rate glycolysis even aerobic environment. termed Warburg effect necessary tumorigenesis. Studies showed pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), key regulator Warburg effect, overexpressed involved numerous cancers. However, expression function PKM2 pancreatic cancer (PC) remain undefined. results showed PKM2 overexpressed PC tissue compared peritumoral tissue. Unexpected, downregulation PKM2 affect proliferation, invasion, chemoresistance PC cells. Since pancreatic cancer hypovascular tumor comparably insufficient energy supply, investigate relationship PKM2 hypoglucose. Interestingly, discovered decreased expression PKM2 detected PC samples lower microvessel density well PC cells treated hypoglucose condition (0.5 mM). Furthermore, downregulation PKM2 facilitated, upregulation PKM2 inhibited, PC cells survival hypoglucose. revealed repressed PKM2 induced autophagy, high NADPH/NADP ratio, biomacromolecule production, reduced ROS accumulation. Moreover, AMPKalpha1 knockdown repressed autophagy survival PC cells hypoglucose, promoted PKM2 knockdown. Collectively, study indicates decreased PKM2 diverts glucose metabolism biomacromolecule accumulation antioxidants generation glucose deprivation. metabolism alteration elevates AMPKalpha1-dependent autophagy, facilitates PC cell survival glucose deprivation. Therefore, functions PKM2 complicated cannot defined oversimplified promoter inhibitor PC.
