 BACKGROUND: Early benefits Roux-en gastric bypass (RYGB) partly mediated caloric restriction patients undergo acutely procedure. Altered DNA methylation occurs metabolic diseases including obesity, well skeletal, muscle eight months RYGB. objective study test whether promoter methylation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1 A), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme-4 (PDK4), transcription factor (TFAM), interleukin-1 beta (IL1 B), interleukin-6 (IL6) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) altered blood low calorie diet (VLCD) RYGB. METHODS: Obese nondiabetic patients (n = 18, body mass index [BMI] 42.3 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2)) underwent 14-day VLCD followed RYGB. Nonobese patients (n = 6, BMI 25.7 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2)) undergoing elective cholecystectomy served controls. DNA methylation selected promoter regions measured whole blood VLCD. subgroup seven patients studied 1-2 days 12 +/- 3 months RYGB. Promoter methylation measured using methylated DNA capture quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: VLCD decreased promoter methylation PPARGC1 A. Methylation PPARGC1 A, TFAM, IL1 B, IL6, TNF promoters changed two days RYGB. Similar changes also seen day one cholecystectomy. Moreover, methylation increased PDK4, IL1 B, IL6, TNF promoters 12 months RYGB. CONCLUSION: RYGB induced profound epigenetic changes VLCD promoters tested genes whole blood. Changes DNA methylation may contribute improved overall metabolic health RYGB.
