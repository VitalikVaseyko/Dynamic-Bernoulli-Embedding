 Selected enzymes measured mixed-fiber bundles individual fibers rat plantaris (PL) soleus (Sol) muscles undergone either 2 wk tetrodotoxin (TTX) inactivation sciatic nerve, sham operation, contralateral TTX limb. TTX disuse caused severe wasting PL (46%) Sol (26%) muscles single fibers (50% 40%, respectively). TTX PL Sol also reduced (50%) glycogen content. TTX, PL, Sol macro samples single fibers, activities (mol.h-1.kg dry wt-1) hexokinase, glycogen phosphorylase, lactate dehydrogenase higher, lower, unchanged, respectively, compared controls. Single-fiber data showed changes occurred fibers. TTX PL macro samples, activities glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), citrate synthase (CS), beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (BOAC), thiolase were, tended be, lower. Single-fiber data showed disappearance high-oxidative moderate glycolytic fibers (i.e., usually fast-twitch oxidative control) appearance fibers metabolic enzyme profile approaching control slow-oxidative fibers. TTX Sol macro samples, GPDH PK tended higher, thiolase, BOAC, CS, MDH lower. Single-fiber data corroborated findings suggested appearance fast fibers downregulated oxidative enzyme profiles. results suggest neuromuscular activity major, sole, determinant size metabolic heterogeneity exists muscle cells.
