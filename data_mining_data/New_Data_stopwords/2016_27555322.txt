 Mycobacterium leprae, intracellular etiological agent leprosy, infects Schwann promoting irreversible physical disabilities deformities. cells responsible myelination maintenance axonal energy metabolism export metabolites, lactate pyruvate. present work, observed infected Schwann cells increase glucose uptake concomitant increase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity, key enzyme oxidative pentose pathway. also observed mitochondria shutdown infected cells mitochondrial swelling pure neural leprosy nerves. classic Warburg effect described macrophages infected Mycobacterium avium observed model, presented drastic reduction lactate generation release infected Schwann cells. effect followed decrease lactate dehydrogenase isoform (LDH-M) activity increase cellular protection hydrogen peroxide insult pentose phosphate pathway GSH-dependent manner. M. leprae infection success also dependent glutathione antioxidant system main reducing power source, pentose pathway, demonstrated 50 70% drop intracellular viability treatment GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine, aminonicotinamide (6-ANAM), inhibitor G6PDH 6-ANAM, respectively. concluded M. leprae could modulate host cell glucose metabolism increase cellular reducing power generation, facilitating glutathione regeneration consequently free-radical control. impact regulation leprosy neuropathy discussed.
