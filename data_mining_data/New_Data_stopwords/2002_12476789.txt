 mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyses oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate, links glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle ATP production. Adequate flux PDC important tissues high ATP requirement, lipogenic tissues (since provides cytosolic acetyl-CoA fatty acid (FA) synthesis), generating cytosolic malonyl-CoA, potent inhibitor carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I). Conversely, suppression PDC activity crucial glucose conservation glucose scarce. review describes recent advances relating control mammalian PDC activity phosphorylation (inactivation) dephosphorylation (activation, reactivation), particular regulation PDC pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) phosphorylates inactivates PDC. PDK activity family four proteins (PDK1-4). PDK2 PDK4 appear expressed major tissues organs body, PDK1 appears limited heart pancreatic islets, PDK3 limited kidney, brain testis. PDK4 selectively upregulated longer term tissues organs response starvation hormonal imbalances insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus hyperthyroidism. Parallel increases PDK2 PDK4 expression appear restricted gluconceogenesic tissues, liver kidney, take well generate pyruvate. Factors regulate PDK4 expression include FA oxidation adequate insulin action. PDK4 also either direct indirect target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha. PPAR alpha deficiency liver kidney restricts starvation-induced upregulation PDK4; however, role PPAR alpha heart skeletal muscle appears complex. observations may important implications pharmacological modulation PDK activity (e.g. use PPAR alpha activators) control whole-body glucose, lipid lactate homeostasis disease states suggest therapeutic interventions must tissue targeted whole-body fuel homeostasis adversely perturbed.
