 presence insulin various carbohydrates long term cultures hepatocytes studied examine mechanism insulin glycolytic metabolites regulate L-pyruvate kinase activity. hepatocytes isolated control rat cultured presence insulin, constant level enzyme activity (16 EU/mg DNA) maintained 12 days. L-pyruvate kinase activity hepatocytes refed rats initially elevated (45 EU/mg DNA) decreased control values 5th day culture. Cells isolated fasted rat initially contained low level L-pyruvate kinase activity (5 EU/mg DNA) increased control values 8th day culture. enzyme activity 5 EU/mg DNA control cells cultured 4 days medium containing either glucose, glycerol fructose without insulin; 10 EU/mg DNA medium containing galactose insulin without glucose, glycerol fructose; 20 EU/mg DNA medium containing insulin either glucose, glycerol fructose. suggested insulin essential induction maintainance L-pyruvate kinase activity, carbohydrates absence insulin unable maintain enzyme activity cultures hepatocytes, insulin glycolytic metabolites may act synergistically increase activity L-pyruvate kinase increasing synthesis enzyme.
