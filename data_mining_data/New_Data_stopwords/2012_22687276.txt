 Mammalian cells require growth-factor-receptor-initiated signaling proliferate. Signal transduction initiates entry cell cycle, also reprograms cellular metabolism. instructional metabolic reprogramming critical cell fulfill anabolic energetic requirements accompany cell growth division. Growth factor signaling mediated PI3K/Akt pathway plays major role regulating cellular uptake glucose, well incorporation glucose carbon lipids membrane synthesis. Tyrosine-kinase-based regulation key glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase also plays critical role directing glucose carbon anabolic pathways. addition, Myc transcription factor mTOR kinase regulate uptake utilization amino acids protein nucleic acid synthesis, well supply intermediates mitochondrial Krebs cycle. However, relationship cellular signaling metabolism unidirectional. Cells, sensing levels intracellular metabolites status key metabolic pathways, exert feedback control signal transduction networks multiple types metabolite-derived protein modifications. mechanisms allow cells coordinate growth division metabolic activity.
