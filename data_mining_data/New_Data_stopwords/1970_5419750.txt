 1. Clostridium pasteurianum grown synthetic medium following carbon sources: (a) (14)C-labelled glucose, alone unlabelled aspartate glutamate, (b) unlabelled glucose plus (14)C-labelled aspartate, glutamate, threonine, serine glycine. incorporation (14)C amino acids cell protein examined. 2. series experiments carbon exogenous glutamate incorporated proline arginine; carbon aspartate incorporated glutamate, proline, arginine, lysine, methionine, threonine, isoleucine, glycine serine. Incorporations exogenous amino acids indicated metabolic sequence: aspartate --> threonine --> glycine right harpoon left harpoon serine. 3. following activities demonstrated cell-free extracts organism: (a) formation aspartate carboxylation phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, followed transamination; (b) individual reactions tricarboxylic acid route 2-oxoglutarate oxaloacetate; glutamate dehydrogenase detected; (c) conversion aspartate threonine via homoserine; (d) conversion threonine glycine constitutive threonine aldolase; (e) serine transaminase, phosphoserine transaminase, glycerate dehydrogenase phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. last activity abnormally high. 4. combined evidence indicates C. pasteurianum biosynthetic role aspartate glutamate generally similar aerobic facultatively aerobic organisms, glycine synthesized glucose via aspartate threonine.
