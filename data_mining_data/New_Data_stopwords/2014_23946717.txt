 Pyruvate kinase (PYK) critical allosterically regulated enzyme links glycolysis, primary energy metabolism, cellular metabolism. Lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively glycolysis energy production anaerobic conditions, reinforces key role PYK metabolism. organisms closely related, adapted huge variety native environments. include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts human gut, antibiotic-resistant pathogens. contrast rather conserved inhibition PYK inorganic phosphate, activation PYK shows high variability type activating compound different lactic acid bacteria. System-wide comparative studies metabolism lactic acid bacteria required understand reasons diversity closely related microorganisms. require knowledge identities enzyme modifiers. Here, predict potential allosteric activators PYKs three lactic acid bacteria adapted different native environments. used protein structure-based molecular modeling enzyme kinetic modeling predict validate potential activators PYK. Specifically, compared electrostatic potential binding phosphate moieties allosteric binding sites, predicted potential allosteric activators docking. made kinetic model Lactococcus lactis PYK relate activator predictions intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions lactic acid bacteria. strategy enabled us predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate sole activator Enterococcus faecalis PYK, predict PYKs Streptococcus pyogenes Lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity allosteric activators, still fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play main activator role vivo. differences specificity allosteric activation may reflect adaptation different environments different concentrations activating compounds. combined computational approach employed readily applied enzymes.
