 Optimal concentrations essential components analyzing activity enzyme associated glycolysis gluconeogenesis rabbit periodontal ligament examined, enzyme assay systems 15 enzymes including 22 reactions established using triethanolamine buffer. Specific activities enzymes, except gluconeogenic reaction phosphoglycerate kinase, systematically evaluated using optimum buffer enzyme, since activity enzyme varied depending buffer used. glycolysis, activity levels hexokinase 6-phosphofructokinase low, consequently enzyme reactions inferred rate-limiting steps. gluconeogenesis, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase aldolase activities extremely low, activities glucose 6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate carboxylase undetectable. results suggest periodontal ligament may gluconeogenesis capability. rise pH, activities key enzymes glycolysis gradually increased, specific "crossover" point found activities glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphoglyceromutase. addition, activity fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, one key enzymes gluconeogenesis, markedly increased rise pH, although pH changes effect aldolase activity. Consequently, alkaline pH appeared result overall stimulation glycolysis.
