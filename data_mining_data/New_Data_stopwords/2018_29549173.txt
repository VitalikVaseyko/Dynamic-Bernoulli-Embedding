 international, multicenter registry established collect retrospective prospective clinical data patients pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, common glycolytic defect causing congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. Medical history laboratory radiologic data retrospectively collected enrollment 254 patients molecularly confirmed PK deficiency. Perinatal complications common, including anemia requiring transfusions, hyperbilirubinemia, hydrops, prematurity. Nearly newborns treated phototherapy (93%) many treated exchange transfusions (46%). Young children, </=5 years old, often transfused splenectomy. Splenectomy, reported 150/254 (59%) patients, associated median rise hemoglobin 1.6 g/dl decreased transfusion burden 90% patients. Predictors response splenectomy included: higher pre-splenectomy hemoglobin (p=0.007), lower indirect bilirubin (p=0.005), missense PKLR mutations (p=0.0017). Post-splenectomy thrombosis reported 11% patients. frequent complications included iron overload (48%) gallstones (45%); however, complications, aplastic crises, osteopenia/bone fragility, extramedullary hematopoiesis, post-splenectomy sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, uncommon. Overall, 87/254 (34%) patients splenectomy cholecystectomy. splenectomy without simultaneous cholecystectomy, 48% later required cholecystectomy. Although risk complications increases severity anemia genotype-phenotype relationship observed, complications common patients PK deficiency. Diagnostic testing PK deficiency considered patients apparent congenital hemolytic anemia close monitoring iron overload, gallstones, complications needed regardless baseline hemoglobin.
