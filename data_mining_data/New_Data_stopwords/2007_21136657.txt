 Cancer gingivo-buccal complex (GBC) major cancer Indian men. study reports identification tumor antigens, elicit antibody response cancer GBC using immunoproteomics. Proteins KB cells separated 2-D PAGE, immunoblotted IgG sera 28 cancer patients, 12 patients leukoplakia, 28 healthy individuals. Antigens detected IgGs patient's sera different among different individuals presence single antigen ranging 7 79%. Several antigens identified MS confirmed immunostaining. three forms alpha-enolase, peroxiredoxin-VI, annexin-II, HSP70, pyruvate kinase, alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, ATP-synthase, phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), aldose reductase, triosephosphate isomerase, cyclophilin-A. Except, HSP70, antigens reported cancer GBC first time. Pyruvate kinase aldose reductase reported elicit autoantibody response cancer earlier. Initial results show autoantibody response alpha-enolase, HSP70, annexin-II, peroxiredoxin-VI, aldose reductase also seen patients leukoplakia GBC, suggest early occurrence autoantibodies process oral carcinogenesis. antigens validated use cancer management immune intervention.
