 response high consumer demand, turkeys intensively selected rapid growth rate breast muscle mass conformation. success breeding selection coincided increasing incidence pale, soft, exudative (PSE) meat defect, especially response heat stress. hypothesized underlying mechanism responsible development PSE meat arises differences expression several critical genes. objective study determine differential gene expression normal PSE turkey meat using 6K turkey skeletal muscle long oligonucleotide microarray. Breast meat samples collected Randombred Control Line 2 turkeys 22 wk age, classified normal PSE primarily based marinade uptake (high = normal, low = PSE). Total RNA isolated meat samples highest (normal, n = 6) lowest (PSE, n = 6) marinade uptake. Microarray data confirmation conducted using quantitative real-time PCR. Selection differentially expressed genes pathway analysis performed using combination fold change (FC) ranking (FC < -1.66, FC >1.66) false discovery rate (<0.35) criteria. calcium signaling pathway highlighted top canonical pathway associated differential gene expression normal PSE turkey. Dramatic downregulation fast-twitch myosin heavy chain coupled upregulation slow-twitch myosin troponin C suggested switch skeletal muscle isoforms, may alter muscle fiber arrangement formation actin-myosin complexes. Changes expression genes actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway also suggest altered structures actin filaments may affect cell motility well strength flexibility muscle cells. Substantial downregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 observed PSE samples, suggesting altered regulation aerobic metabolic pathway birds developed PSE meat defect.
