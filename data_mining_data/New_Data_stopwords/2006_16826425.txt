 propensity uveal melanoma cells invasion metastasis critical factor clinical outcome form cancer, essential biology aggressiveness completely understood. present study investigated involvement hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) uveal melanoma migration, invasion adhesion, hallmarks aggressive behavior cancer cells. demonstrate exposure hypoxia increased migration, invasion adhesion uveal melanoma cells vitro assays. "silencing" HIF-1alpha, oxygen-regulated subunit HIF-1, using RNA interference technology resulted marked decrease uveal melanoma cell migration, invasion adhesion. GeneChip microarray analysis revealed number genes regulate cancer invasion metabolism CXCR4, angiopoietin-related protein, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) also activated hypoxia HIF-1-dependent manner Mum2B uveal melanoma cells. demonstrate serum deprivation resulted HIF-1 CXCR4 activation, suggesting specific metabolic regulation HIF-1 cells. Microarray analysis serum-deprived cells identified among upregulated genes number cancer invasion-related genes, known HIF-1-regulated targets. Taken together, results suggest involvement HIF-1 uveal melanoma tumorigenesis significant complex, metabolic regulation HIF-1 activation Mum2B uveal melanoma cells specificities.
