 Accumulating evidence indicates miRNA regulatory circuits play important roles tumorigenesis. previously reported miR-124 correlated prognosis colorectal cancer due PKM-dependent regulation glycolysis. However, mechanism miR-124 regulates apoptosis colorectal cancer remains largely elusive. Here, show miR-124 induced significant apoptosis panel colorectal cancer cell lines. mitochondrial apoptosis pathway activated miR-124. Furthermore, pro-apoptotic role miR-124 dependent status PKM1/2 level. PKM1 required miR-124-induced apoptosis. Via direct protein-protein interaction, PKM1 promoted HNF4alpha binding promoter region miR-124 transcribing miR-124. Moreover, HNF4alpha PKM1 dramatic effect colorectal cancer cell apoptosis presence miR-124. However, inhibition miR-124 blocked cell apoptosis induced HNF4alpha PKM1. data indicate miR-124 alters expression genes involved glucose metabolism also stimulates cancer cell apoptosis. addition, positive feedback loop miR-124 PKM1/HNF4alpha plays important role colorectal cancer cell apoptosis; suggests disrupting regulatory circuit might potential therapeutic tool colorectal cancer treatment.
