 Paraquat shown highly toxic compound humans animals, many cases acute poisoning death reported past decades. present study undertaken evaluate comprehensively herbicides (Paraquat) plant extracts biochemical aspects Lymnaea natalensis snails. found exposure L. natalensis Paraquat plant extracts led significant reduction infectivity Fasciola gigantica miracidia snail. glucose level hemolymph exposed snails elevated, glycogen showed decrease soft tissues compared control group. addition, activity level enzymes representing glycolytic enzymes hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) snail's tissues reduced response treatment. concluded pollution aquatic environment herbicide would adversely affect metabolism L. natalensis snails. Snails treated Agave attenuate, Ammi visnaga, Canna iridiflora plant less toxic effect compared snails treated Paraquat.
