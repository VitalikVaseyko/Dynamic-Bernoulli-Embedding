 Metabolic changes within cell niche affect cell fate involved many diseases disorders including cancer viral infections. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) etiological agent Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). KSHV latently infected cells express subset viral genes, mainly located within latency-associated region, among 12 microRNAs. Notably, miRNAs responsible inducing Warburg effect infected cells. identify novel mechanism enabling KSHV manipulate metabolic nature tumour microenvironment. demonstrate KSHV infected cells specifically transfer virus-encoded microRNAs surrounding cells via exosomes. flow genetic information results metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis surrounding non-infected cells. Importantly, exosome-mediated metabolic reprogramming neighbouring cells supports growth infected cells, thereby contributing viral fitness. Finally, data show miRNA transfer-based regulation cell metabolism general mechanism used herpesviruses, EBV, well transfer non-viral onco-miRs. exosome-based crosstalk provides viruses mechanism non-infectious transfer genetic material without production new viral particles, might expose immune system. suggest viruses cancer cells use mechanism shape specific metabolic niche contribute fitness.
