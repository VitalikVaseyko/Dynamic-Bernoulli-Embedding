 procedure simultaneous purification isoenzymes pyruvate kinase (type M2 L) chicken liver worked out. isoenzyme produces single band dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis. molecular weight 190 000 contains four apparently identical subunits Mr = 50 000. isoenzymes differ isoelectric points (type L: 6.3; type M2: 8.3) kinetic behaviour. Pyruvate kinase type L S-shaped phosphoenolpyruvate saturation curve (K 0.5=0.79 mM) transformed hyperbola presence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, type M2 phosphoenolpyruvate saturation curve Michaelis-Menten type (K0.5=0.2mM). Antibodies pyruvate kinase type L chicken liver inactivated type L rat partially inactivated type M2 chicken rat; antibodies type L react type M1 chicken breast muscle. therefore concluded that, contrary previous report (Strandholm, J.J. et al. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 2242-2246), avian liver contains pyruvate kinases type M2 L mammalian liver does.
