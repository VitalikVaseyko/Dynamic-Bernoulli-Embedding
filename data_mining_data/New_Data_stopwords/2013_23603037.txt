 present study evaluates relative efficacies insulin PLGA-loaded-nano-insulin (NIn) combating arsenic-induced impairment glucose uptake, insulin resistance mitochondrial dysfunction L6 skeletal muscle cells. L6 cells treated 0.5 mM sodium arsenite 30 min cells treated either 100 nM insulin (standardized dose) either two doses, 50 nM 100 nM nano-insulin. Various biomarkers like pyruvate-kinase glucokinase, ATP/ADP ratio, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic release mitochondrial cytochrome c, cell membrane potential calcium-ion level studied analyzed ascertain status mitochondrial functioning experimental control sets L6 cells. size, morphology zeta potential formulated NIn determined using dynamic light scattering, scanning electronic atomic-force microscopies. Expression signalling cascades like GLUT4, IRS1, IRS2, UCP2, PI3, p38 critically analyzed. Overall results suggested insulin NIn improved mitochondrial functioning arsenite-intoxicated L6 cells, NIn showing better effects much lower dose (at nearly 10-fold decreased dose) produced insulin. Nano-insulin non-toxic effective much lesser dose, therefore, potential therapeutic use management arsenic induced diabetes.
