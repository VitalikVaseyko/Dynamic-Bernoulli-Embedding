 preferential use aerobic glycolysis energy production cancer cells, phenomenon known 'Warburg effect', well recognized considered therapeutic applications. However, whether inhibition glycolysis effective types cancer unclear. current study shows glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), exhibits cytotoxic effect non-small cell lung cancer p53-dependent manner. 2DG significantly inhibits ATP production p53-deficient lung cancer cells (H358) p53-wt cells (A549). contrast p53-wt cells, p53-defective cells unable compensate need energy via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) glycolysis inhibited. presence p53, increased ROS OXPHOS increases expression p53 target genes known modulate metabolism, including synthesis cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2) TP53-induced glycolysis apoptosis regulator (TIGAR). Importantly, 2DG selectively induces expression antioxidant enzymes manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) p53-dependent manner. results demonstrate killing cancer cells inhibitor glycolysis efficient cancer cells without functional p53 p53 protects metabolic stress up-regulation oxidative phosphorylation modulation antioxidants.
