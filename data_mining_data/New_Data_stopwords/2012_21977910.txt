 Incubation adult rat cardiac myocytes increasing glucose concentrations decreased phosphorylation (alphaThr172) activity AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase). effect could demonstrated without measurable changes adenine nucleotide contents. glucose effect additive decrease AMPK activity caused insulin, attenuated adrenaline, mimicked glucose analogues, lactate pyruvate due changes myocyte glycogen content. AMPK activity decreased xylitol PMS (phenazine methosulfate) increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) thiamine. PMS DHEA respectively, increased decreased CO2 formation PPP (pentose phosphate pathway). AMPK activity inversely related myocyte content Xu5P (xylulose 5-phosphate), intermediate non-oxidative arm PPP. Endothall, inhibitor PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A), abolished glucose effect AMPK activity. studies needed define 'active component' mediates glucose effect whether site action PP2A.
