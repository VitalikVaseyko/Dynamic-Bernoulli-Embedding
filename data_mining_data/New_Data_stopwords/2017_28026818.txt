 amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 formed proteolytic processing amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays key role development progression Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies associated formation protein aggregates central nervous system. Recent proteomic profiling mouse rat brain preparations means beta-amyloid peptide immobilized Affigel-10 revealed large group amyloid-binding proteins (n>80). Many (about 25%) proteins previously identified isatin-binding proteins. aim study validate direct interaction beta-amyloid peptide highly purified intact oxidized peroxiredoxin, M-type pyruvate kinase, alpha-enolase, effect isatin interaction. study performed using SPR-based Biacore 3000 Biacore X100 biosensors shown proteins form molecular complexes immobilized beta-amyloid peptide. Kd values complexes varied 8.36small ha, Cyrillic10-8 (peroxiredoxin) 1.97small ha, Cyrillic10-6 (alpha-enolase). Oxidative modification investigated proteins caused opposite effects complexes peptides beta-amyloid. endogenous neuroprotector isatin increased dissociation complexes formed beta-amyloid peptide intact proteins (peroxiredoxin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and/or oxidized proteins (peroxiredoxin, pyruvate kinase) used study.
