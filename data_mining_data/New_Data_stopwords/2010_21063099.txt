 Mitochondrial Krebs cycle keto acid pool depends upon input pyruvate glutamate maintain homeostasis. studied affect glucose-derived pyruvate removal compensatory input glutamine-derived glutamate accelerated glutamate metabolism via glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). glutamine minus glucose media (Gln-Glc), NH(4)(+) production increased 41% without increase glutamine uptake consistent accelerated glutamate metabolism via GDH. Alanine production dropped 40% consistent shift glutamate alanine aminotransferase (ALT) GDH. Troglitazone (TRO) added Gln-Glc media enhanced glutamate metabolism via GDH expense glutamate metabolism via ALT since alanine production dropped additional 70%. TRO reduced cell glutamate content 30% increasing lactate production 5-fold consistent blocking cytosolic pyruvate formed mitochondrial malate reentering cycle maintaining keto acid pool homeostasis. Consequently mitochondrial keto acid pool deficit pulls glutamate via GDH cycle. Additionally TRO reduced cytosolic pH effectively pushes glutamate via GDH, rather merely shifting glutamate ALT GDH. Providing intramitochondrial pyruvate form methyl pyruvate reduced glutamate metabolism via GDH elevated glutamate metabolism via ALT control levels restoring acid-base balance. findings consistent TRO regulation anaplerosis dependent upon dual pull (cycle keto-acid deficit)/push (cytosolic acidosis) mechanisms.
