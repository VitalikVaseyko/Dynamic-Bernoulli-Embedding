 Excessive production acetate problem frequently encountered aerobic high-cell-density fermentations Escherichia coli. Here, examined genetic alterations resulting glycogen overproduction possible means direct flux carbon away acetate pool. Glycogen overaccumulation achieved either using regulatory glgQ mutation transforming cells plasmid containing glycogen biosynthesis genes glgC (encoding ADPG pyrophosphorylase) glgA (encoding glycogen synthase) native promoter. strategies resulted approximately five-fold increase glycogen levels significant effect acetate excretion. glgC glgA genes placed control isopropyl---D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible tac promoter, construct used stimulate glycogen production mutant defective acetate biosynthesis due deletion ack (acetate kinase) pta (phosphotransacetylase) genes. glycogen overproduction ack pta strain induced late log phase, biomass production increased 15 20% relative uninduced controls. Glycogen overaccumulation significant influence carbon partitioning: output carbon dioxide peaked earlier control strain, levels unusual fermentation byproduct, pyruvate, reduced. Exogenous pyruvate metabolized rapidly, suggesting higher activity gluconeogenesis tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle result glycogen overproduction. Potential mechanisms observed metabolic alterations discussed. results suggest ack pta mutants producing glycogen may suitable starting point constructing E. coli strains improved characteristics high-cell-density fermentations.
