 sucrose amino acids accumulate desiccation-tolerant leaf material C(4) resurrection plant, Sporobolus stapfianus Gandoger (Poaceae). present investigation aimed examining sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity various metabolic checkpoints involved co-ordination carbon partitioning competing pathways dehydration. initial phase dehydration, photosynthesis starch content declined immeasurable levels, whilst significant increases hexose sugars, sucrose, amino acids associated concomitant significant increases SPS pyruvate kinase (PK) activities, maximal activity levels phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH), NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT). next phase dehydration characterized changes metabolism coinciding net hexose sugar phosphorylation. phase characterized significant increase sucrose accumulation, increased rates net sucrose accumulation maximum rates SPS activity measured saturating limiting (inhibitory) conditions. SPS protein also increased. stronger competitive edge SPS carbon entering glycolysis hexose phosphorylation also demonstrated decrease respiration simultaneous, significant decline PEPCase PK activities. decreased anabolic demand 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), remained constant, shown co-ordinated decrease GOGAT. proposed increase amino acids phase dehydration may part attributable breakdown insoluble proteins.
