 Mammalian cells depend extracellular input regulation growth, proliferation survival. Cancer cells evade requirements, able take nutrients cell-autonomous fashion, allows continuous growth proliferation. fulfill high bioenergetic demands imposed transformation, tumors must develop alternative mechanisms energy production. Accordingly, biochemical signature cancer cells involves shift aerobic glycolysis, also known "Warburg effect". property cancer cells resulted great utility modern medicine detection early tumors positron-emission scanning. Nonetheless, underlying mechanisms contribution Warburg effect malignant phenotype remained obscure. Thanks recent advances cancer research, beginning understand link cancer genetics abnormal use glucose tumors. new scenario thus emerging, bioenergetics would contribute sustain malignant transformation. findings important better understanding tumorigenesis; tumor reliance glycolysis exploited search novel, potent therapeutic approaches cancer treatment.
