 conclusion, postnatal changes 2,3-DPG concentration canine erythrocyte directly related changes erythrocyte 1,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration. apparent differential regulation 2,3-DPG mutase phosphatase activities. Glucose consumption lactate production canine erythrocyte change postnatal development, thus, overall rate controlling reactions upper portion glycolytic pathway regulate changes 1,3-diphosphoglycerate. analysis intermediate enzyme levels 2,3-DPG shunt indicates pyruvate kinase functions controlling sink reaction. Variation pyruvate kinase step causes changes erythrocyte phosphoenolpyruvate levels. Since enolase, phosphoglyceromutase phosphoglycerate kinase reactions equilibrium, changes phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations paralleled changes concentrations 1,3-diphosphoglycerate 2,3-DPG. propose rise erythrocyte 2,3-DPG, first 60 days postnatal age, results decline levels fetal M2 isozyme pyruvate kinase. subsequent decline erythrocyte 2,3-DPG normal adult levels may result developmental change pyruvate kinase isozymes. changes erythrocyte glycolysis following birth increase oxygen transporting efficiency hemoglobin higher oxygen tensions neonatal environment. provides initial reserve blood oxygen transport capacity suppresses erythrocyte production, resulting condition defined postnatal anemia. apparent defect postnatal erythropoiesis.
