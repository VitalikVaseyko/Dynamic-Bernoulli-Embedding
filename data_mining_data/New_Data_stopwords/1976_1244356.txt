 enzyme cod fish muscle catalyzes irreversible decarboxylation oxalacetate homogeneous several criteria contains significant pyruvate kinase activity. every unit decarboxylase activity (0.90 unit/mg) 235 units pyruvate kinase activity (212 units/mg). inability separate two activities variety physical techniques indicates due single enzyme protein. Improtantly, two activities appear take place overlapping sites enzyme. Phosphoenolpyruvate 4-ethyloxalacetate strong linear competitive inhibitors decarboxylase activity respect oxalacetate dissociation constants 3.2 10.2 muM, respectively, 4-ethyloxalacetate linear competitive inhibitor pyruvate kinase activity respect phosphoenolpyruvate, Ki - 13.5 muM. addition, activities exhibit sigmoidal kinetics substrates. differential influence effectors substrate cooperativity two reactions indicates decarboxylase reaction may important tool studying allosteric mechanisms enzyme.
