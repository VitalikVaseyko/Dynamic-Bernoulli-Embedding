 Congenital hemolytic anemias resulting PK, PFK, G6PD enzyme deficiencies reported domestic animals. Dogs PFK deficiency may episodes intravascular hemolysis hemoglobinuria addition persistent compensated hemolytic anemia. Patients mild G6PD deficiency anemic may show increased susceptibility oxidant-induced erythrocyte injury. Persistent methemoglobinemia reported dogs cats methemoglobin reductase enzyme deficiency. Affected animals cyanotic-appearing mucous membranes show mild clinical signs attributable hypoxemia. Enzyme assays usually done acquired causes hemolytic anemia methemoglobinemia ruled out.
