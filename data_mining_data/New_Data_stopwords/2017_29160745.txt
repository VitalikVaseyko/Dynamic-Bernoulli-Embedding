 purpose research deciphering Warburg paradox, biochemical enigma unsolved since 1923. solved demonstrating specific character, i.e. forced aerobic lactate exportation, represents crucial metabolic device counteract cytotoxic effect produced excess pyruvate connection glycolysis Krebs cycle. solution verified exposing cancer cells different histogenesis pyruvate concentrations higher physiological ones, showing concentrations totally innocuous injected mice. mechanism pyruvate cytotoxicity relies saturation respiratory chain, leading negative shift cytosolic NADP/NADPH ratio consequent restriction purine synthesis related cell apoptosis. reducing equivalents generated glycolysis cytosolic metabolism compete disposal trough respiratory chain; makes cytotoxicity pyruvate inversely related mitochondrial number efficiency various cell types. Thus, cytotoxicity high anaplastic cancer stem cells, whose mitochondria extremely immature (cristae-poor); contrary, inhibition brought adult differentiated cells, physiologically rich mature mitochondria. generates pyruvate anticancer selectivity, together lack general toxicity, making pyruvate represent ideal candidate radical non toxical anticancer treatment.
