 Beginning phenylketonuria, dietary therapy inborn errors focused primarily restriction precursor affected catabolic pathway attempt limit production potential toxins. Anaplerotic therapy based concept may exist energy deficit diseases might improved providing alternative substrate citric acid cycle (CAC) electron transport chain enhanced ATP production. article focuses basic problem, may relate catabolic disorders, provides current experience involving inherited diseases mitochondrial fat oxidation, glycogen storage, pyruvate metabolism using anaplerotic compound triheptanoin. observations led realization 'inter-organ' signalling 'nutrient sensors' adenylate monophosphate mediated-protein kinase (AMPK) mTOR (mammalian target rapamycin) appear play significant role intermediary metabolism diseases. Activated AMPK turns catabolic pathways augment ATP production turning synthetic pathways consume ATP. Information provided regarding inter-organ requirements normal metabolic function crisis anaplerotic therapy using triheptanoin, direct source substrate CAC energy production, appears successful approach improved quality life patients.
