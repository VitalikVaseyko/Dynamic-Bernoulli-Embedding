 Microgravity many detrimental impact brain functions, however underlying mechanism remain unclear. present study, 28 days tail-suspension (30 degrees ) used simulate microgravity rats. showed oxidative stress hippocampus increased 28 days simulated microgravity consideration decreased expression NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) declined activities total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), CuZn-SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). Using RNA-seq, investigated effect simulated microgravity expression genes hippocampus, 849 genes found differentially expressed. According pathway analysis, differentially expressed genes involved cytoskeleton, metabolism, immunity, transcription regulation, etc. interesting note differentially expressed genes involved hypoxia-associated pathway. agreement this, expression hypoxia induced factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), master regulator oxygen homeostasis, significantly increased. Meanwhile, HIF-2alpha, HIF-1alpha paralog, elevated compared control group. expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), three well-defined downstream targets HIF-1alpha, up-regulated hippocampus 28 days simulated microgravity exposure. Additionally, brain oxygen saturation (SO2) blood flow analyzed tissue oxygen analysis system also significantly reduced. findings indicate simulated microgravity might cause alteration oxygen homeostasis, providing novel insight better understanding simulated microgravity affects function hippocampus new direction development countermeasure brain dysfunction spaceflight (actual microgravity).
