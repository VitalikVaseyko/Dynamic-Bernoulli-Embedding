 non-invasive technique 13C nuclear magnetic resonance applied study glucose metabolism vivo insect parasite Crithidia fasciculata. found anaerobic conditions [1-13C]glucose underwent glycolytic pathway whose main metabolic products identified [2-13C]ethanol, [2-13C]succinate [1,3-13C2]glycerol. metabolites excreted C. fasciculata incubation medium, cells [3-13C]phosphoenolpyruvate also detected addition aforementioned compounds. C3 acid apparently acceptor primary CO2 fixation reaction, leads Trypanosomatids synthesis succinate. addition sodium bicarbonate incubation mixture L-[3-13C]malate detected among excretion products, ethanol:succinate ratio 2.0 absence bicarbonate changed ratio 0.6 presence latter. due shift balance carboxylation phosphoenolpyruvate, leading succinate, pyruvate decarboxylation leading ethanol. addition 25% 2H2O incubation mixture led formation [2-13C, 2-2H]ethanol derived prior incorporation 2H+ pyruvate reactions mediated either pyruvate kinase malic enzyme. However, 2H+ incorporation L-malate detected, excluding possibility latter formed carboxylation pyruvate, lending support idea L-malate results carboxylation phosphoenolpyruvate oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. formation [2-13C, 2-2H]-succinate conditions reflected uptake 2H+ reduction fumarate. incubations carried presence 100% 2H2O, several [1-13C, 1-2H]ethanol species detected, well [2-13C, 2-2H]malate [1,3-13C2, 1,3-2H2]glycerol. former deuterated compounds reflect existence NAD2H species incubations carried 100% 2H2O, incorporation 2H+ [1,3-13C2]glycerol must attributed phosphoglucose-isomerase-mediated reaction glycolysis.
