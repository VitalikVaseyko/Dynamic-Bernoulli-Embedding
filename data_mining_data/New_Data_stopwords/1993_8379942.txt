 reports effects epidermal growth factor (EGF) gluconeogenesis indicated effects depend substrate used observable lag time 30-40 min. Recently, immediate transient effect EGF glucose synthesis described perfused liver system. extend study effect EGF gluconeogenesis isolated hepatocytes fasted rats. delayed effect EGF gluconeogenesis studied adding substrate 40 min peptide. conditions EGF increased glucose synthesis pyruvate, decreased substrate lactate glycerol modify gluconeogensis fructose dihydroxyacetone. EGF affect metabolic flux glycolysis, determined production lactate+pyruvate 30 mM glucose. Furthermore, EGF modify metabolic flux pyruvate kinase, determined production lactate+pyruvate 1 mM dihydroxyacetone. differing effects EGF gluconeogenesis depending substrate used explained effects EGF cytosolic redox state (measured lactate/pyruvate ratio). 20 min addition EGF, mitochondrial redox state (measured 3-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio) decreased. effect EGF blocked ammonium, also abolished effect peptide gluconeogenesis. Thus effect EGF mitochondrial level appears necessary effects gluconeogenesis. Taken together, results indicate delayed effects EGF gluconeogenesis secondary effects peptide mitochondrial cytosolic levels. addition delayed effects, observed EGF rapidly transiently stimulated glucose synthesis lactate, decreased cytosolic redox state increased oxygen consumption. rapid effects required presence extracellular calcium disappeared presence rotenone, suggesting rapid effect EGF gluconeogenesis secondary stimulation mitochondrial respiration.
