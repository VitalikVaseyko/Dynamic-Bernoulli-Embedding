 Lead known potent inhibitor many enzymes working brain, thus possibly inducing functional problems brain pathophysiological conditions. Among enzymes involved glucose metabolism energy production. investigated inhibitory effects low-level lead brain hexokinase (HK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) rat brain homogenate. PDHc distinctively inhibited low-dose lead acetate added last (IC50 = 5 microM) reaction mixture. enzymes completely resistant 5 microM lead acetate. homogenate preincubated lead acetate HK dramatically inhibited low-level lead acetate (1-5 microM), manner dependent preincubation time lead concentration. However, inhibitory effect abolished coincubation substrates, glucose ATP. results suggest exposure low levels lead may increase risk cerebral hypometabolism caused direct inhibition specific glucose-utilizing enzymes. context, lead might regarded risk factor abnormal glucose metabolism seen kinds neurodegenerative disorders sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
