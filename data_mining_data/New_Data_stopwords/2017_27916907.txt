 BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays prominent role tumorigenesis. Metformin exerts antitumorigenic effects various cancers. study investigated mechanisms metformin TGF-beta1-induced Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cervical carcinoma cells. METHODS: cells cultured 10 ng/mL TGF-beta1 induce EMT treated without metformin. Cell viability evaluated CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit 8, CCK-8) assay; apoptosis analyzed flow cytometry; cell migration evaluated wound-healing assay. Western blotting performed detect E-cadherin, vimentin, signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3), snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAIL2), phosphorylation p70s6k (p-p70s6k) -Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) Results: TGF-beta1 promoted proliferation migration, attenuated apoptosis compared cells treated metformin without TGF-beta1 cervical carcinoma cells. Moreover, metformin partially abolished TGF-beta1-induced EMT cell proliferation reversed TGF-beta1-induced EMT. addition, anti-EMT effects metformin could partially accord rapamycin, specific mTOR inhibitor. Metformin decreased p-p70s6k expression blockade mTOR/p70s6k signaling decreased PKM2 expression. CONCLUSION: Metformin abolishes TGF-beta1-induced EMT cervical carcinoma cells inhibiting mTOR/p70s6k signaling down-regulate PKM2 expression. study provides novel mechanistic insight anti-tumor effects metformin.
