 Reactive oxygen species suggested play important role damage cardiac tissue following ischemia reperfusion. Oxygen radicals may also contribute cardiotoxicity anthracycline antibiotics, doxorubicin. tested whether selective inhibition muscle gene expression, previously observed cardiocytes treated doxorubicin, might reflective generalized response evoked oxidative stress cardiac tissue. Cardiocytes culture exposed hydrogen peroxide glucose oxidase, effects muscle gene expression measured. Exposure agents led reduction levels mRNA muscle-specific genes cardiac alpha-actin, troponin I, myosin light chain 2 (slow), isoform creatine kinase, without affecting levels non-muscle genes pyruvate kinase beta-actin. magnitude effect similar observed doxorubicin. Although hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzyme catalase intracellular radical scavengers N-acetylcysteine 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea without effect doxorubicin-dependent reduction gene expression, inhibited reduction muscle gene expression mediated hydrogen peroxide. observations suggest oxygen free radicals modulate muscle gene expression cardiocytes pathway distinct utilized doxorubicin.
