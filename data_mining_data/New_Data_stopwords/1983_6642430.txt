 Pyruvate kinase type L M2 activities measured microdissected periportal perivenous liver tissue rats different dietary states. specific antibody pyruvate kinase type L used distinguish two isoenzymes. Using separated cells found L-isoenzyme essentially restricted parenchymal M2-isoenzyme non-parenchymal cells. Pyruvate kinase type L activity perivenous zone twice high periportal zone male female fed rats. Starvation 48 h led decrease overall activity lower perivenous-periportal gradient. refeeding 48 h overall activity gradient increased normal level. Pyruvate kinase type M2 homogenously distributed within liver acinus. 48 h starvation change overall activity zonal distribution observed. Refed rats exhibited slightly reduced overall activity. Since hepatocytes contain total regulatory L- M2-pyruvate kinase heterogeneous distribution L-isoenzyme different dietary states supports model metabolic zonation liver parenchyma glycolysis predominantly perivenous zone.
