 mathematical model includes biochemical interactions among PTS system, phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) used evaluate dynamic behavior glycolytic pathway Escherichia coli steady-state conditions. influence ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) dynamic regulation pathway also analyzed. model shows dynamic behavior system affected significantly depending whether ADP, PEP, F6P considered constant steady state. Sustained oscillations observed dADP/dt equal 0 completely suppressed dADP/dt = 0 steady-state value. However, PEP F6P constant, system evolves toward formation stable limit cycles periods ranging 0.2 min hours.
