 natural polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) displays wide spectrum health beneficial activities, yet precise mechanisms remain fully elucidated. show RSV promotes multimerization cellular levels adiponectin 3T3-L1 adipocytes. stimulatory effect RSV affected knocking Sirt1, diminished suppressing expression levels DsbA-L, recently identified adiponectin-interactive protein promotes adiponectin multimerization. Suppression Akt signaling pathway resulted increase expression levels DsbA-L adiponectin. hand, knocking FOXO1 suppressing activity expression levels AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) down-regulated DsbA-L adiponectin. stimulatory effect RSV adiponectin DsbA-L expression completely diminished FOXO1-suppressed AMPK-inactivated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, results demonstrate RSV promotes adiponectin multimerization 3T3-L1 adipocytes via Sirt1-independent mechanism. addition, show stimulatory effect RSV regulated Akt/FOXO1 AMPK signaling pathways. Last, show DsbA-L plays critical role promoting effect RSV adiponectin multimerization cellular levels.
