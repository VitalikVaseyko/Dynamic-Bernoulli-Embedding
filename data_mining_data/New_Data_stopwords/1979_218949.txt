 series synthetic peptide analogs cardiac troponin inhibitory subunit (TN-1) phosphorylation site sequence, Arg12-Pro-Ala-Pro-Ala-Val-Arg18-Arg19-Ser20-Asp21-Arg22-Ala, tested substrates catalytic subunit cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37, ATP:protein phosphotransferase). substrates, peptides generally inferior pyruvate kinase analog peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly COOH-terminal amide analog. Replacing Arg-19 alanine minor effect kinetics phosphorylation TN-1 peptide analog. contrast, replacement Arg-22 Arg-18 alanine resulted marked enhancement reduction Vmax, respectively. results study demonstrated synthetic peptide analogs local phosphorylation site sequences natural substrates may differ widely capacity act substrates protein kinase. case TN-1 peptide analogs, contribution 4 arginine residues distinguished terms influence kinetics phosphorylation.
