 Long-term electrical stimulation (14-28 days) rabbit fast muscles (tibialis anterior, TA extensor digitorum longus, EDL) using intermittent high frequency (3 trains per min 5 duration 40 Hz, 8 h per day) produced changes enzyme activities similar found continuous stimulation frequency occurring nerves slow muscles (10 Hz). activity citrate synthetase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase increased two 3-fold within 28 days. 4-fold increase hexokinase whereas phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase fructose-1,6-diphosphatase decreased 60% activity levels contralateral unstimulated muscles. Blood flow oxygen consumption rest changed even 28 days stimulation, increased contractions muscles stimulated either frequency, level twice high control muscles. Glucose uptake similar control muscles rest contractions output lactate similar found control muscles muscles stimulated 40 Hz. Muscles stimulated 10 Hz smaller lactate output. Thus intermittent stimulation high frequency (40 Hz) continuous low frequency (10 Hz) produced similar changes aerobic metabolism fuel uptake provided total number stimuli comparable stimulation carried sufficiently long period.
