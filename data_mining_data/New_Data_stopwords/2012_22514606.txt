 Streptococcus suis (SS) zoonotic pathogen causes severe disease symptoms pigs humans. Biofilms SS bind extracellular matrix proteins endothelial epithelial cells cause persistent infections. study, differences protein expression profiles SS grown either planktonic cells biofilms identified using comparative proteomic analysis. results revealed existence 13 proteins varying amounts, among six upregulated seven downregulated Streptococcus biofilm compared planktonic controls. convalescent serum mini-pig, challenged SS, applied Western blot assay visualize proteins biofilm grown vitro separated two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. total 10 immunoreactive protein spots corresponding nine unique proteins identified MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. nine proteins, five (Manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, phosphoglycerate kinase, Hypothetical protein SSU05_0403) previously reported immunogenic properties SS knowledge. remaining four immunogenic proteins (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysin, pyruvate dehydrogenase DnaK) identified planktonic biofilm growth conditions. conclusion, protein expression pattern SS, grown biofilm, different SS grown planktonic cells. five immunogenic proteins specific SS biofilm cells may potentially targeted vaccine candidates protect SS biofilm infections. four proteins common biofilm planktonic cells targeted vaccine candidates protect biofilm acute infections.
