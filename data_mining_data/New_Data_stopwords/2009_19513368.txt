 possibility reducing ammonium concentration blood mice hyperammonemia ammocytes (erythrocytes loaded glutamate synthase) metabolic characteristics cells studied. Injection ammocytes blood stream animals hyperammonemia led reduction blood ammonium concentration within first 30-120 min activity ammocytes retained least 2 days. Endogenous phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, Na(+),K(+)-ATPase ammocytes remained levels catalytic activities characteristic intact erythrocytes. Hence, ammocytes functionally active cells used protective system pathological hyperammonemia, method regarded new technology medicine veterinary.
