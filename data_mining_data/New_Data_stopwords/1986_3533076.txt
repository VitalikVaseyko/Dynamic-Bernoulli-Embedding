 pyruvate kinase activity erythrocytes normal diabetic subjects examined order establish enzyme valid indicator mean cell age studies age-dependent erythrocyte functions. study reveals enzyme activity erythrocytes affected condition diabetes suggests may provide simple means determination cell age erythrocyte insulin binding studies. Present data indicate mean cell age erythrocytes diabetic patients significantly different normal although insulin binding erythrocytes markedly reduced compared normal subjects.
