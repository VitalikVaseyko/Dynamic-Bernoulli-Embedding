 Amphibolurus nuchalis collected central Australia mid- (January) late summer (March). Endurance time 1 km/h motorized treadmill greater larger lizards, scaling M0.65. Maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) scales M0.96; standard metabolic rate (SMR) scales M0.83. Factorial aerobic scope thus increases ontogenetically (9.4 1 g vs. 15 50 g). organ masses scale allometrically; larger lizards relatively smaller livers, larger hearts thigh muscles. Hematocrit hemoglobin increase early ontogeny, mass independent adults. Maximal vitro catalytic rates determined citrate synthase (CS) pyruvate kinase (PK) liver, heart, thigh muscle lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (lactate oxidation) heart. enzyme activities (expressed per g tissue) scale positively, except CS heart. Females exhibit lower SMR heart CS activity. March animals exhibit elevated endurance, VO2max, heart LDH, thigh CS PK activities. Individual variation endurance correlates individual differences heart LDH thigh CS and/or PK activities. Individual differences VO2max partly related variation hematocrit.
