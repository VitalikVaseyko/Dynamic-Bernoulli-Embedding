 demonstrated previously synthesis amino acids photosynthetically fixed carbon leaves Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder occurs middle photoperiod. paper reports experiments identify control points regulating carbon flow leaves.Estimations made levels intermediates 3-phosphoglycerate pyruvate 3-phosphoglycerate fructose 6-phosphate leaves different times photoperiod. Application Chance crossover analysis indicates periods amino acid synthesis, pyruvate kinase activated, possibly ammonium ions. Fructose diphosphate aldolase could possibly additional control point, showing activation amino acid synthesis ceased. indication diurnal periodicity activity fructose diphosphate aldolase.
