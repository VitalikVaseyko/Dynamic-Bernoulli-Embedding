 simplest mechanism generation mitochondrial outer membrane potential (OMP) VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel)-hexokinase complex (VHC), suggested earlier, VDAC-glucokinase complex (VGC), computationally analyzed. Even less 4% VDACs bound hexokinase, calculated OMP high enough trigger electrical closure VDACs beyond complexes threshold concentrations glucose. results confirmed previous hypothesis Warburg effect caused electrical closure VDACs, leading global restriction outer membrane permeability coupled aerobic glycolysis. model showed inhibition conductance and/or increase voltage sensitivity relatively small fraction VDACs factors like tubulin potentiate electrical closure remaining free VDACs. extrusion calcium ions mitochondrial intermembrane space generated OMP, positive inside, might increase cancer cell resistance death. Within VGC model, known effect induction ATP release mitochondria accumulated glucose-6-phosphate pancreatic beta cells might result known effect GK dissociation VDAC-GK complex, also decrease free energy glucokinase reaction, leading OMP decrease VDAC opening. suggest VDAC-mediated electrical control mitochondrial outer membrane permeability, dependent metabolic conditions, fundamental physiological mechanism global regulation mitochondrial functions cell death.
