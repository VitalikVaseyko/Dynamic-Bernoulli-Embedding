 Activities enzymes related glucose metabolism measured canine feline liver. significant differences plasma glucose immunoreactive insulin concentrations dogs cats. Glucokinase activities absent feline liver, however, activities glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, significantly higher canine livers. Activities rate limiting enzymes gluconeogenesis pyruvate carboxylase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase glucose-6-phosphatase feline livers significantly higher canine livers.
