 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) steadily progress towards regenerative medicine applications increasing emphasis development bioreactor platforms enable expansion cells clinically relevant numbers. Surprisingly little known metabolic requirements hESCs, precluding rational design optimisation platforms. study, undertook in-depth characterisation MEL-2 hESC metabolic behaviour exponential growth phase, combining metabolic profiling flux analysis tools physiological (hypoxic) atmospheric (normoxic) oxygen concentrations. overcome variability growth profiles problem closing mass balances complex environment, developed protocols accurately measure uptake production rates metabolites, cell density, growth rate biomass composition, designed metabolic flux analysis model estimating internal rates. hESCs commonly considered highly glycolytic inactive immature mitochondria, however, whilst results study confirmed glycolysis indeed highly active, show least MEL-2 hESC, supported use oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria utilising carbon sources, glutamine maximise ATP production. conditions, glycolysis disconnected mitochondria glucose converted lactate. difference growth rates cells cultured physiological atmospheric oxygen concentrations observed cause differences fluxes majority internal metabolic pathways associated biogenesis. results suggest hESCs display conventional Warburg effect, high aerobic activity despite high lactate production, challenging idea anaerobic metabolism low mitochondrial activity. results study provide new insight used rational bioreactor design development novel culture media hESC maintenance expansion.
