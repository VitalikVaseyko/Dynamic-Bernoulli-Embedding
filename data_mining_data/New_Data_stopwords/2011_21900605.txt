 Gliomas contain small number treatment-resistant glioma stem cells (GSCs), thought tumor regrowth originates GSCs, thus rendering GSCs attractive target novel treatment approaches. Cancer cells rely glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation glucose metabolism, phenomenon used 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography imaging solid cancers, targeting metabolic pathways cancer cells become topic considerable interest. However, GSCs indeed important tumor control, knowledge metabolic state GSCs needed. hypothesized metabolism GSCs differs progeny. Using unique imaging system GSCs, assessed oxygen consumption rate, extracellular acidification rate, intracellular ATP levels, glucose uptake, lactate production, PKM1 PKM2 expression, radiation sensitivity, cell cycle duration GSCs progeny panel glioma cell lines. found GSCs progenitor cells less glycolytic differentiated glioma cells. GSCs consumed less glucose produced less lactate maintaining higher ATP levels differentiated progeny. Compared differentiated cells, GSCs radioresistant, correlated higher mitochondrial reserve capacity. Glioma cells expressed isoforms pyruvate kinase, inhibition either glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation minimal effect energy production GSCs progenitor cells. conclude GSCs rely mainly oxidative phosphorylation. However, challenged, use additional metabolic pathways. Therefore, targeting glycolysis glioma may spare GSCs.
