 Aging individuals diabetic patients often exhibit concomitant reductions skeletal muscle mass/strength insulin sensitivity, suggesting intimate link muscle aging insulin resistance. Foxo1, member FOXO transcription factor family, important player insulin signaling due inhibitory role glucose uptake utilization skeletal muscle. Phosphorylation Foxo1 thought mitigate transactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase 4 (PDK4), negative regulator glycolytic enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). contrast, aging would regulate acetylation/deacetylation machineries glucose utilization skeletal muscle Foxo1/PDH axis remains largely undetermined. Accumulating body evidence shown resveratrol, natural polyphenol grapes red wine, activates longevity-related protein sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) augments insulin sensitivity addition well-documented effects mitochondrial energetics. present review summarizes role Foxo1/SIRT1 insulin signaling skeletal muscle proposes insight activation SIRT1 deacetylase activity deacetylate suppress Foxo1-induced transactivation PDK4 may represent anti-hyperglycemic mechanism resveratrol aging skeletal muscle.
