 OBJECTIVE: Based proteomics technology, Pi-yang deficiency syndrome (PYDS) correlated differential proteins screened, thus providing powerful experiment reliance exploring essence PYDS. METHODS: Totally 36 SD rats SPF grade randomly divided normal control group (n = 16) PYDS group (n = 20). PYDS model rats induced improper diet, overstrain, administration yang impairing bitter cold herbs. total proteins ileum separated extracted rats PYDS group normal control group. differential protein dots identified using Delyder 2D 6.5 image analysis software two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) technology. finger print map corresponding peptide qualities obtained applying MALDI TOF/TOF. differential proteins identified using Mascot search library. RESULTS: Judged statistics fuzzy mathematics, Pi-yang deficiency rat model successfully established. Eight proteins differential expressions involving cell skeleton, energy metabolism, signal transduction, obtained. them, 4 up-regulated proteins, i.e., desmin, cytokeratin8 (CK8), pyruvate kinase (PK), ezrin. Four down-regulated proteins glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), cytokeratin19 (CK19), cytokeratin1 (CK1), actin. CONCLUSION: pathogenesis PYDS might slowed energy metabolism rate, reduced energy production, changed structure ileal villin, weakened absorbing digestive functions.
