 Polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) influenza virus (A/WSN/33), expressed cloned cDNA absence viral proteins, accumulates nucleus. examined location nature nuclear localization signal PB1 using deletion mutants chimeric constructions chicken muscle pyruvate kinase, cytoplasmic protein. studies showed novel features nuclear localization signal PB1. signal present internally within residues 180 252 PB1. Moreover, unlike nuclear localization signals, single stretch contiguous amino acids. Instead, possessed two discontinuous regions separated intervening sequence could deleted without affecting nuclear localization property. hand, deletion either two signal regions rendered protein cytoplasmic, indicating function regions required nuclear localization one region alone sufficient. signal regions contained short stretches basic residues. Possible ways novel bipartite signal function nuclear localization discussed.
