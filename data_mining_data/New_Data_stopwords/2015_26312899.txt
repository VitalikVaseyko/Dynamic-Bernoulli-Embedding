 BACKGROUND: Somatic activating mutations PIK3CA, encodes p110alpha catalytic subunit phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) frequently found cancers identified spectrum mosaic overgrowth disorders ranging isolated digit enlargement extensive overgrowth body, brain, vasculature. aimed study affected dermal fibroblasts view inform therapeutic studies, observe cancer-associated mutations isolation. METHODS: measured PIP3 concentrations dermal fibroblasts endogenous PIK3CA mutations wild type fibroblasts using mass spectrometry, measured downstream signalling events ELISA immunoblotting. Cellular proliferation evaluated 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, cell size assessed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Glycolysis mitochondrial tests performed extracellular flux analyser (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA, USA), mitochondrial potential measured FACS-based JC1 staining. Experiments repeated exposure 5 nmol everolimus 72 h. FINDINGS: Mutant fibroblasts two times higher basal PIP3 concentrations wild-type fibroblasts (p=0.0017), concomitant AKT p70S6 activation downstream. rate cellular proliferation higher mutant cells low serum conditions, median cell size statistically different. Glycolytic capacity similar mutant wild type fibroblasts, subtle differences mitochondrial function detected blunted responses uncoupling agents reduced membrane potentials. Treatment everolimus reversed aberrant AKT(ser473) p70S6 signalling, slowed cellular proliferation, reversed mitochondrial abnormalities, associated, paradoxically, increases PIP3 concentrations. INTERPRETATION: experiments demonstrate activation PI3K-AKT pathway affected fibroblasts increased proliferation, hypertrophy. Moreover, identified changes mitochondrial function keeping known propensity AKT modulate elements Warburg effect. results suggest inhibitors mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) might beneficial, inhibitors require formal evaluation clinical trials. targeted therapy p110alpha inhibitors enticing future option.
