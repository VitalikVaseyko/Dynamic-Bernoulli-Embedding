 study, aimed establish mechanisms whereby peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonism brings redistribution fat toward subcutaneous depots away visceral fat. rats treated full PPARgamma agonist COOH (30 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) 3 weeks, subcutaneous fat mass doubled visceral fat reduced 30% relative untreated rats. Uptake triglyceride-derived nonesterified fatty acids greatly increased subcutaneous fat (14-fold) less visceral fat (4-fold), concomitant increase, restricted subcutaneous fat only, mRNA levels uptake-, retention-, esterification-promoting enzymes lipoprotein lipase, aP2, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1. Basal lipolysis fatty acid recycling stimulated COOH subcutaneous fat visceral fat, frank quantitative depot specificity. agonist increased mRNA levels enzymes fatty acid oxidation thermogenesis much strongly visceral fat subcutaneous fat, concomitantly stronger elevation O2 consumption former latter. Mitochondrial biogenesis stimulated equally depots. findings demonstrate PPARgamma agonism redistributes fat stimulating lipid uptake esterification potential subcutaneous fat, compensates increased O2 consumption; conversely, lipid uptake minimally altered energy expenditure greatly increased visceral fat, consequent reduction fat accumulation.
