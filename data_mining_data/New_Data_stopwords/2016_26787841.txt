 MicroRNA 211 (miR-211) negatively regulates genes drive invasion metastatic melanoma. Compared normal human melanocytes, miR-211 expression significantly reduced absent nonpigmented melanoma cells lost human melanoma progression. investigate molecular mechanism tumor suppressor function, miR-211 ectopically expressed nonpigmented melanoma cells. Ectopic expression miR-211 reduced hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein levels decreased cell growth hypoxia. HIF-1alpha protein loss correlated downregulation miR-211 target gene, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). present evidence resumption miR-211-mediated downregulation PDK4 melanoma cells causes inhibition invasion nonpigmented melanomas via HIF-1alpha protein destabilization. Thus, tumor suppressor miR-211 acts metabolic switch, loss expected promote cancer hallmarks human melanomas. Melanoma, one deadliest forms skin cancer, kills nearly 10,000 people United States per year. previously shown small noncoding RNA, termed miR-211, suppresses invasion growth aggressive melanoma cells. results presented support hypothesis miR-211 loss melanoma cells causes abnormal regulation energy metabolism, turn allows cancer cells survive low oxygen concentrations-a condition generally kills normal cells. findings highlight novel mechanism melanoma formation: miR-211 molecular switch turned melanoma cells, raising hope future might able turn switch back on, thus providing better treatment option melanoma.
