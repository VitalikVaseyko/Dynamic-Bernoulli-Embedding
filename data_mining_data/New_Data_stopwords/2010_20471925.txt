 Gill primary osmoregulatory organ euryhaline fish acclimate salinity change. effect salinity gill proteome ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis, investigated two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS). Eight eighteen altered proteins successfully identified. involved osmoregulation, cytoskeleton, energy metabolism, stress response. results showed vinculin, echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like protein 1, pyruvate kinase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), transaldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) down-regulated, whereas cofilin up-regulated ayu transferred fresh water (FW) brackish water (BW). Partial cDNA sequences BHMT, HSP70, Na(+)/K(+) ATPase (NKA) alpha-subunit 18S rRNA genes subsequently determined used 2-DE data verification real-time PCR. Gill BHMT HSP70 mRNAs decreased significantly BW-transferred ayu, NKA alpha-subunit mRNA significant change. suggested cell volume-regulatory response, especially protection BHMT/betaine system might play important role ayu acclimation salinity change.
