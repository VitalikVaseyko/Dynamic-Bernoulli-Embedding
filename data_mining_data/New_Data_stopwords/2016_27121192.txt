 Cancer metabolism characterized accelerated glycolytic rate facing reduced activity oxidative phosphorylation. "Warburg effect" represents standard diagnose monitor tumor aggressiveness (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose whose uptake currently regarded accurate index total glucose consumption. Studying cancer metabolic response respiratory chain inhibition metformin, repeatedly observed reduction tracer uptake facing marked increase glucose consumption. puzzling discordance brought us discover (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose preferentially accumulates within endoplasmic reticulum exploiting catalytic function hexose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase. Silencing enzyme expression activity decreased tracer uptake glucose consumption, caused severe energy depletion decreased NADPH content without altering mitochondrial function. data document existence unknown glucose metabolism triggered hexose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase within endoplasmic reticulum cancer cells. Besides basic relevance, finding improve clinical cancer diagnosis might represent potential target therapy.
