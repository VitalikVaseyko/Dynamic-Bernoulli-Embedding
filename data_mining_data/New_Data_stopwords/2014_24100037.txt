 Pulses insulin released pancreatic beta-cells maintain blood glucose narrow range, although source pulses unclear. others proposed positive feedback mediated glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) enables beta-cells generate metabolic oscillations via autocatalytic activation product fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Although much indirect evidence accumulated favor hypothesis, direct measurement oscillating glycolytic intermediates lacking. probe glycolysis directly, engineered family inter- intramolecular FRET biosensors based glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKAR; pyruvate kinase activity reporter), multimerizes activated upon binding FBP. introduced Min6 beta-cells, PKAR FRET efficiency increased rapidly response glucose. Importantly, however, metabolites entering downstream PFK1 (glyceraldehyde, pyruvate, ketoisocaproate) failed activate PKAR, consistent sensor activation FBP; dependence PKAR FBP confirmed using purified sensor vitro. Using novel imaging modality monitoring mitochondrial flavin fluorescence mouse islets, show slow oscillations mitochondrial redox potential stimulated 10 mm glucose phase glycolytic efflux PKM2, measured simultaneously neighboring islet beta-cells expressing PKAR. results indicate PKM2 activity beta-cells oscillatory consistent pulsatile PFK1 mediator slow glycolytic oscillations.
