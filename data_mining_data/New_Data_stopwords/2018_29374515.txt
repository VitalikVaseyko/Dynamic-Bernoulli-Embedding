 Ganoderic acid (GAD) highly oxygenated tetracyclic triterpenoid. study aims assess effects GAD energy metabolism colon cancer regulation SIRT3 expression whether effect related acetylated cyclophilin D. results demonstrated GAD inhibits energy reprogramming colon cancer cells including glucose uptake, lactate production, pyruvate acetyl-coenzyme production colon cancer cells. Meanwhile, GAD upregulated protein expression SIRT3. Furthermore, interruption SIRT3 expression significantly reversed effects SIRT3 energy reprogramming colon cancer. addition, GAD induced deacetylated cyclophilin (CypD) SIRT3, whereas SIRT3-shRNA inhibited combining effect CypD. energy reprogramming effects GAD colon cancer seem mediated SIRT3 upregulation via acetylated CypD inhibition.
