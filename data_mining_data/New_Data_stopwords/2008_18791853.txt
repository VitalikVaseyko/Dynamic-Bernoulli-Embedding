 Glucose plays key role energy source majority mammals, importance fish appears limited. now, physiological basis apparent glucose intolerance fish fully understood. distinct regulation hepatic glucose utilization (glycolysis) production (gluconeogenesis) may advanced explain relative inability fish efficiently utilize dietary glucose. summarize information regarding nutritional regulation key enzymes involved glycolysis (hexokinases, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase pyruvate kinase) gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase glucose-6-phosphatase) pathways well bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. effect dietary carbohydrate level source activities gene expression mentioned key enzymes also discussed. Overall, data strongly suggest liver fish species apparently capable regulating glucose storage. persistent high level endogenous glucose production independent carbohydrate intake level may lead putative competition exogenous (dietary) glucose endogenous glucose source energy, may explain poor dietary carbohydrate utilization fish.
