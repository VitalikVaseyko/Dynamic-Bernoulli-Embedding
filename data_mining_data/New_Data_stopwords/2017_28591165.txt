 Targeting mitochondrial energy metabolism novel approach cancer research traced back description Warburg effect. Dichloroacetate, controversially discussed subject many studies cancer research, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor. Dichloroacetate causes metabolic changes cancerous glycolysis towards oxidative phosphorylation via indirect activation pyruvate dehydrogenase mitochondria. Canine mammary cancer frequently diagnosed therapy prognosis still remains poor. study, canine mammary carcinoma, adenoma non-neoplastic mammary gland cell lines treated using 10 mM Dichloroacetate. effect cell number, lactate release PDH expression cell respiration investigated. Further, effect apoptosis several apoptotic proteins, proliferation, microRNA expression evaluated. Dichloroacetate found reduce cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis examined cell lines.
