 BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). responsible mechanisms well understood. Hepatocarcinogenesis increases age enhanced factors impose demand liver regeneration. alcohol hepatotoxic, habitual alcohol ingestion evokes recurrent demand hepatic regeneration. alcohol-preferring (P) rat model mimics level alcohol consumption humans habitually abuse alcohol. Previously, showed habitual heavy alcohol ingestion amplified age-related hepatocarcinogenesis P rats, 80% alcohol-consuming P rats developing HCCs 18 months alcohol exposure, compared 5% water-drinking controls. METHODS: Herein, used quantitative real-time PCR quantitative immunocytochemistry compare liver tissues alcohol-consuming P rats water-fed P rat controls 6, 12, 18 months drinking. aimed identify potential mechanisms might underlie differences liver cancer formation hypothesized chronic alcohol ingestion would activate Hedgehog (HH), regenerative signaling pathway overactivated HCC. RESULTS: Chronic alcohol ingestion amplified age-related degenerative changes hepatocytes, cause appreciable liver inflammation fibrosis even 18 months heavy drinking. HH signaling also enhanced alcohol exposure, evidenced increased levels mRNAs encoding HH ligands, HH-regulated transcription factors, HH target genes. Immunocytochemistry confirmed increased alcohol-related accumulation HH ligand-producing cells HH-responsive target cells. HH-related regenerative responses also induced alcohol-exposed rats. Three processes (i.e., deregulated progenitor expansion, reverse Warburg effect, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions) known promote cancer growth tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-related changes Hedgehog signaling resultant deregulation liver cell replacement might promote hepatocarcinogenesis.
