 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) gut peptide promotes insulin release pancreatic beta cells. GLP-1 shown confer glucose-insensitive beta cells glucose sensitivity modulation activity ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel. channel closing effect GLP-1, interacting corresponding G-protein-coupled receptors, well established; however, knowledge, study shown whether GLP-1 directly induces activation beta-cell KATP channels. Here, aimed evaluate whether activation beta-cell KATP channels GLP-1 exists affects intracellular Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)]i). KATP channel activity measured isolated rat pancreatic beta cells whole-cell perforated patch-clamp recordings diazoxide-containing pipette solution. Changes [Ca(2+)]i subcellular localization KATP channels observed using calcium-sensitive dye fura-4/AM anti-Kir6.2 antibodies INS-1 beta cells, respectively. eliminate well-known inhibitory effects GLP-1 KATP channel activity, channels fully inhibited pretreatment methyl pyruvate epigallocatechin-3-gallate. pretreated beta cells, GLP-1 exendin-4 promptly activated channels, reducing [Ca(2+)]i. phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 blocked effects GLP-1 channel activity. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate mimicked effects GLP-1. results suggested beta-cell GLP-1 receptor signaling involved activation KATP channels via PI3K-dependent pathway. alternative mechanism GLP-1 function may act negative feedback pathway, modulating glucose-dependent GLP-1 inhibition KATP channel activity.
