 Aerobic glycolysis cancer cells regulated multiple effectors include Akt pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Mucin 1 (MUC1) heterodimeric glycoprotein aberrantly overexpressed human breast carcinomas. show transformation rat fibroblasts oncogenic MUC1-C subunit associated Akt-mediated increases glucose uptake lactate production, consistent stimulation glycolysis. results also demonstrate MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain binds directly PKM2 B- C-domains. Interaction MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain Cys-3 PKM2 C-domain Cys-474 found stimulate PKM2 activity. Conversely, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated phosphorylation MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain Tyr-46 conferred binding PKM2 Lys-433 inhibited PKM2 activity. human breast cancer cells, silencing MUC1-C associated decreases glucose uptake lactate production, confirming involvement MUC1-C regulation glycolysis. addition, EGFR-mediated phosphorylation MUC1-C breast cancer cells associated decreases PKM2 activity. findings indicate MUC1-C subunit regulates glycolysis response conferred part PKM2. Thus, overexpression MUC1-C oncoprotein diverse human carcinomas could importance Warburg effect aerobic glycolysis.
