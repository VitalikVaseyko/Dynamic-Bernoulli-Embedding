 BACKGROUND/AIMS: present study investigated signaling pathway underlying Rac1 activation induced linoleic acid derivative 8-[2-(2-pentyl-cyclopropylmethyl)-cyclopropyl]-octanoic acid (DCP-LA). METHODS: Activity protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) assayed cell-free conditions. Western blot carried quantify phosphorylation insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Akt PC-12 cells. Rac1 activity monitored foerster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis using living fixed PC-12 cells. RESULTS: DCP-LA markedly suppressed PTP1B activity concentration (100 pM-100 microM)-dependent manner. DCP-LA binding assay, fluorescein-conjugated DCP-LA produced single fluorescent signal band 60 kDa, corresponding molecule PTP1B, signal attenuated abolished co-treatment pretreatment non-conjugated DCP-LA. DCP-LA significantly enhanced nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated phosphorylation IRS-1 Tyr1222 Akt1/2 Thr308/309 Ser473/474 PC-12 cells. FRET analysis, DCP-LA significantly enhanced NGF-stimulated Rac1 activation, abrogated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) inhibitor BX912, Akt inhibitor MK2206. CONCLUSION: results present study show DCP-LA-induced PTP1B inhibition, possibly direct binding, causes Rac1 activation enhancing pathway along receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt/Rac1 axis.
