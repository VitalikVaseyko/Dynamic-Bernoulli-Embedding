 mammalian cardiomyocytes, mitochondria adjacent ATPases participation creatine kinase (CK) constitute functional compartments exchange ADP ATP delimited cytosolic bulk solution. question arises extends ectothermic vertebrates: low body temperature thinner cardiomyocytes lower density membrane structures may reduce need structural basis compartmentation. saponin-skinned cardiac fibres rainbow trout Atlantic cod, investigated mitochondrial respiration induced endogenous ADP generated ATPases competition ADP pyruvate kinase (PK) excess. low Ca(2+) activity (pCa = 7.0), PK lowered ATP-induced respiration 40% trout 26% cod. high Ca(2+) activity (pCa = 5.41), PK effect. Additionally, ADP release fibres almost zero increased drastically upon inhibition respiration 1 mM Na-azide. suggests fibres compartmented. PK abolished creatine-stimulated respiration trout suggesting less tight coupling CK respiration mammals. conclusion, intracellular compartmentation seems general feature vertebrate cardiomyocytes, whereas role CK unclear, seems less important energy transport species lower metabolism.
