 basic ferritin level red cells examined 60 healthy volunteers 110 patients various diseases red cell series. samples heparinized whole blood first leucocytes removed haemolyzed. subsequent centrifuging supernatant basic ferritin content assessed means Amersham Ferritin RIA kit (Amersham, Great Britain). Normal values healthy volunteers varied 3.2 30.2 ag/ery. patients iron deficiency values significantly reduced, patients pernicious anaemia, beta-thalassemia minor, hereditary spherocytosis glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency pyruvate kinase deficiency levels red cell ferritin significantly elevated, compared control group. red cell ferritin level depends iron supply cells red cell series amount needed erythropoiesis. reduced supply sideropenia leads reduced level red cell ferritin, haemolytic anaemia level depends generally elevated iron supply organism possibly impaired haemoglobin synthesis, one hand, concurrent elevated iron requirements case hyperplasia red cell formation, hand. Assessment red cell ferritin important accurate estimation amount iron available cell haeme formation also elucidate pathogenesis changes iron metabolism diseases red cell series.
