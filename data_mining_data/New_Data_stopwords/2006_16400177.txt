 pyrophosphate-dependent glycolysis, ATP/ADP-dependent enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase replaced pyrophosphate-dependent PFK pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), respectively. variant glycolysis widespread among bacteria, also occurs parasitic anaerobic eukaryotes Giardia Entamoeba spp. sequenced two genes PPDK amitochondriate oxymonad Streblomastix strix found evidence PPDK Trichomonas vaginalis parabasalia, enzyme thought absent. Streblomastix Giardia genes may related one another, Entamoeba perhaps Trichomonas distinct closely related bacterial homologues. findings suggest pyrophosphate-dependent glycolysis widespread eukaryotes previously thought, enzymes pathway coexists ATP-dependent often previously thought may spread lateral transfer genes pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes bacteria.
