 growth Pyrobaculum aerophilum yeast extract nitrate stimulated addition maltose. Extracts maltose/yeast extract/nitrate-grown cells contained enzyme activities modified Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway, including ATP-dependent glucokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-phosphate aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, GAPOR, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase pyruvate kinase. activity GAPOR stimulated fourfold maltose, indicating role sugar degradation. GAPOR purified 200-fold homogeneity characterized 67 kDa monomeric, extremely thermostable protein. enzyme showed high specificity glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate use glyceraldehyde, acetaldehyde formaldehyde substrates. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight analysis purified enzyme, ORF PA1029 identified coding gene, gapor, sequenced genome Pyrobaculum aerophilum. data indicate (micro)aerophilic Pyrobaculum aerophilum contains functional GAPOR part modified EM pathway. Cells strictly aerobic crenarchaeon Aeropyrum pernix also contain enzyme activities modified EM pathway similar Pyrobaculum aerophilum, except GAPN activity replaces GAPOR activity.
