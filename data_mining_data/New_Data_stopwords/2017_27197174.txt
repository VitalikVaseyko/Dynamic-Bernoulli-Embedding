 Sirtuins participate sensing nutrient availability directing metabolic activity match energy needs energy production consumption. However, pivotal targets sirtuins cancer mainly unknown. study, identify M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) critical target sirtuin SIRT2 implicated cancer. PKM2 directs synthesis pyruvate acetyl-CoA, latter transported mitochondria use Krebs cycle generate ATP. Enabled shotgun mass spectrometry analysis founded tissue culture models, identified candidate SIRT2 deacetylation target PKM2 lysine 305 (K305). Biochemical experiments including site-directed mutants mimicked constitutive acetylation suggested acetylation reduced PKM2 activity preventing tetramerization active enzymatic form. Notably, ectopic overexpression deacetylated PKM2 mutant Sirt2-deficient mammary tumor cells altered glucose metabolism inhibited malignant growth. Taken together, results argued loss SIRT2 function cancer cells reprograms glycolytic metabolism via PKM2 regulation, partially explaining tumor-permissive phenotype mice lacking Sirt2 Cancer Res; 76(13); 3802-12.
