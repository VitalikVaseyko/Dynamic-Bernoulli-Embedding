 upregulation glycolysis cancer cells (the "Warburg effect") common implications prognosis treatment. energetically inefficient adequate oxygen supply, adaptive value tumor remains unclear. suggested acidity produced glycolysis beneficial cancer cells promotes proliferation normal cells. Current models acid-mediated tumor invasion hypothesis, however, account increased glycolysis non-limiting oxygen concentrations therefore fully explain Warburg effect. show Warburg effect explained form cooperation among cancer cells, products glycolysis act public good, even oxygen supply high enough make glycolysis energetically inefficient. multiplayer game non-linear, non-monotonic payoff functions models benefits acidity induced glycolysis reveals clonal selection stabilize glycolysis even energetically costly, is, non-limiting oxygen concentration. Characterizing evolutionary dynamics glycolysis reveals cases anti-cancer therapies rely modification acidity effective.
