 Long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) group transcripts longer 200 nucleotides code proteins. However, class RNAs plays pivotal regulatory roles. mechanism action highly complex. Mounting evidence shows lncRNAs regulate cancer onset progression variety ways. regulate cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion metastasis, also regulate glucose metabolism cancer cells different ways, directly regulating glycolytic enzymes glucose transporters (GLUTs), indirectly modulating signaling pathways. review, summarized role lncRNAs regulating glucose metabolism cancer, help understand better pathogenesis malignant tumors. understanding role lncRNAs glucose metabolism may help provide new therapeutic targets novel diagnostic prognosis markers human cancer.
