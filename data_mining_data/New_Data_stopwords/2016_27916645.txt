 nuclear receptor factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARbeta/delta) regulate target genes transcriptional activation repression ligand-dependent independent mechanism well interactions transcription factors. PPARbeta/delta exerts essential regulatory functions intermediary metabolism elucidated detail, clearly also plays role inflammation, differentiation, apoptosis cancer-associated processes, is, however, mechanistically partly understood. Consistent functions clinical associations link expression PPARbeta/delta target genes unfavorable outcome several human cancers. However, available data yield clear picture PPARbeta/delta's role cancer-associated processes fact partly controversial. article provides overview research area discusses role PPARbeta/delta cancer light complex mechanisms transcriptional regulation potential druggable anti-cancer target.
