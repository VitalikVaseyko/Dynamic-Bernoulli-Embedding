 PIK3CA, encodes p110alpha subunit PI3K, frequently mutated oncogenic breast cancer. PI3Kalpha inhibitors clinical development despite promising early clinical activity, intrinsic resistance frequent among patients. previously reported residual downstream mTORC1 activity upon treatment PI3Kalpha inhibitors drives resistance agents. However, mechanism underlying phenotype fully understood. show cancer cells resistant PI3Kalpha inhibition, PDK1 blockade restores sensitivity therapies. SGK1, activated PDK1, contributes maintenance residual mTORC1 activity direct phosphorylation inhibition TSC2. Targeting either PDK1 SGK1 prevents mTORC1 activation, restoring antitumoral effects PI3Kalpha inhibition resistant cells.
