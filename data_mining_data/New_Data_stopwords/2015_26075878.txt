 Hexokinases (HKs) catalyze first step glucose metabolism, phosphorylating glucose glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). HK2/hexokinase-II predominant isoform insulin-sensitive tissues heart, skeletal muscle, adipose tissues also upregulated many types tumors associated enhanced aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect). Accumulating evidence indicates HK2 plays important role glycolysis also cell survival. Although increasing recognition cellular metabolism cell survival closely related, molecular link metabolism autophagic pathways fully elucidated. recently discovered HK2 facilitates autophagy response glucose deprivation (HK substrate deprivation) protect cardiomyocytes, suggest HK2 functions molecular switch glycolysis autophagy ensure cellular energy homeostasis starvation conditions.
