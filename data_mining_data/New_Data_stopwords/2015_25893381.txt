 Cancer cells preferentially use aerobic glycolysis meet increased energetic biosynthetic demands, phenomenon known Warburg effect. underlying mechanism fully understood. RRAD, small GTPase, potential tumor suppressor lung cancer. RRAD expression frequently down-regulated lung cancer, associated tumor progression poor prognosis. Recently, RRAD reported repress Warburg effect, indicating down-regulation RRAD expression important mechanism contributing Warburg effect lung cancer. However, mechanism RRAD inhibits Warburg effect remains unclear. Here, found RRAD negatively regulates NF-kappaB signaling inhibit GLUT1 translocation Warburg effect lung cancer cells. Mechanically, RRAD directly binds p65 subunit NF-kappaB complex inhibits nuclear translocation p65, turn negatively regulates NF-kappaB signaling inhibit GLUT1 translocation Warburg effect. Blocking NF-kappaB signaling largely abolishes inhibitory effects RRAD translocation GLUT1 plasma membrane Warburg effect. Taken together, results revealed novel mechanism RRAD negatively regulates Warburg effect lung cancer cells.
