 effect cytoskeleton modulators glycolytic enzyme binding examined hepatopancreas Otala lactea attempt identify potential cellular binding sites. Binding followed measuring phosphofructokinase (PFK), aldolase (ALD), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) pyruvate kinase (PK) distribution low speed pellets (12,000 xg), high speed pellets (100,000 xg) high speed supernatants. Taxol (which stabilizes microtubules), colchicine (which destabilizes microtubules) cytochalasin B (which destabilize F-actin filaments) added homogenate prior centrifugation. Addition taxol increased amount PFK associated high speed pellet. Cytochalasin B reduced binding PFK PK low speed pellet. ALD GAPDH binding unaffected treatment. Lowering pH crude homogenate increased PFK binding low speed pellet 33%. effect could reversed addition cytochalasin B suggesting pH influences PFK-F-actin interaction vivo. differential binding response PFK, PK, ALD GAPDH added effectors suggests that, cell, PFK PK bound different subcellular structural elements ALD GAPDH.
