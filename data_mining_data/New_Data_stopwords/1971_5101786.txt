 Radioisotope studies bilirubin turnover, ferrokinetics, red cell survival ((51)Cr) patient erythrocyte PK deficiency provided evidence prompt reticulocyte sequestration destruction reticuloendothelial system. mature erythrocytes appeared survive well despite deficiency PK. PK-deficient reticulocytes, dependent upon oxidative phosphorylation ATP production, exquisitely sensitive cyanide- nitrogen-induced mitochondrial inhibition. oxidative phosphorylation unavailable, ATP levels decline rapidly, producing alterations cell membrane allow massive losses potassium water. result shrunken, spiculated, viscous cell whose rheologic properties would favor sequestration reticuloendothelial system. reticulocytes particularly low levels PK exhibit low glycolytic rates thus uniquely reliant upon oxidative phosphorylation. reticulocytes, better endowed PK activity, meet increased ATP requirements young erythrocytes. Upon reaching maturity, cells diminished ATP needs can, therefore, survive despite enzyme deficiency.
