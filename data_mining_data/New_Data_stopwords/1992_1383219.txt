 Two enantiomers carbovir, carbocyclic analog 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine, compared respect phosphorylation phosphorylation nucleotides mammalian enzymes. 5'-Nucleotidase catalyzed phosphorylation (-)-carbovir, active HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), phosphorylate (+)-carbovir. (-)-Carbovir monophosphate 7,000 times efficient substrate GMP kinase (+)-carbovir monophosphate. Pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, creatine kinase phosphorylated enantiomers carbovir diphosphate similar rates. Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase preferentially phosphorylated (-)-enantiomer. enantiomers carbovir triphosphate substrates alternative substrate inhibitors HIV reverse transcriptase. Thus, contrasting HIV-inhibitory activities carbovir enantiomers due differential phosphorylation cellular enzymes due enantioselectivity HIV reverse transcriptase.
