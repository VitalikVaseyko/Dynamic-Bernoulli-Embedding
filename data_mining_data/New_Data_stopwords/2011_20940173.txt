 AIMS: measure activity key phosphotransfer enzymes creatine kinase (CK), adenylate kinase (AK), glycolytic enzymes two common mouse models chronic heart failure. METHODS RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice subjected transverse aortic constriction (TAC), myocardial infarction induced coronary artery ligation (CAL), sham operation. Activities phosphotransfer enzymes CK, AK, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), pyruvate kinase assessed spectrophotometrically. Mice characterized echocardiography magnetic resonance imaging 5- 8-week post-surgery selected presence congestive heart failure. mice severe left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired systolic function pulmonary congestion compared sham controls. significant decrease myocardial CK maximal CK reaction velocity observed experimental models heart failure. However, activity AK isoforms remained unchanged, despite reduction protein expression. contrast, activities glycolytic phosphotransfer mediators GAPDH PGK 19 12% higher TAC, 31 23% higher CAL models, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chronic heart failure mouse characterized impaired CK function, unaltered AK, increased activity glycolytic phosphotransfer enzymes. pattern altered phosphotransfer activity observed independent heart failure aetiology.
