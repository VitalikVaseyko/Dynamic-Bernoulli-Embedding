 natural mutations observed pyruvate kinase (PK)-M2, homotetramer isozyme, study correlated differential activity enzyme dominant negative manner B-lymphoblastoid cells, established two Bloom syndrome (BS) patients, BS1 BS3 50 90%, respectively; 75% freshly obtained PHA stimulated lymphocytes BS patient diagnosed first time India. gene screen involving critical domains PK-M gene BS cells resulted observation missense mutation BS1 BS patient frame shift mutation BS3, exon-10, coding intersubunit contact domain (ISCD) PK-M2 protein. Apart mutations, variations region gene, normal BS cells, affect enzyme activity, since silent. Computer-based modeling studies PK-M2 protein mutation suggestive changed interaction two domains within subunit BS1, gross structural change BS3, changed interaction two subunits tetramer BS patient. absence mutations regions PK-M2 gene normal subjects randomly chosen unrelated genes DNA BS cell lines cells BS patient, authenticated presence observed mutations Bloom syndrome cells. correlation observed differential enzyme activity nature mutation intersubunit contact domain (ISCD) region PK-M2 gene interesting, indicted site nature mutation heterozygous state could influence enzyme activity differentially dominant negative manner. importance mutations Bloom syndrome cells, however, remains elucidated, conjectured.
