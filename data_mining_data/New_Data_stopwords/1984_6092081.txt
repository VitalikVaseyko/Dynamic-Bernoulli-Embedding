 identities protein phosphatases involved regulation hepatic glycolysis, gluconeogenesis aromatic amino acid breakdown investigated using 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, L-pyruvate kinase, phenylalanine hydroxylase bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase substrates. Purified preparations protein phosphatases-1, 2A, 2B 2C exhibited activity towards five substrates vitro, although phosphatases-1 2B weakly active. Studies liver extracts using inhibitor-2 trifluoperazine, inhibit protein phosphatase-1 2B, respectively, confirmed phosphatases unlikely important dephosphorylating substrates vivo. Sequential fractionation rat liver extracts anion-exchange chromatography gel-filtration failed resolve protein phosphatases acting substrate, apart protein phosphatases-2A 2C. present results, together described following paper (in journal) indicate assay conditions used, protein phosphatase-2A powerful phosphatase acting substrate, although protein phosphatase-2C contributes significant percentage activity towards 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. clear evidence obtained role metabolites regulation dephosphorylation five substrates. study reinforces contention serine-specific threonine-specific protein phosphatase catalytic subunits participate cellular regulation.
