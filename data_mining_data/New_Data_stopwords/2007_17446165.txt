 Extracellular signaling molecules bound cell surface receptors regulate nuclear function consequences cell proliferation, differentiation, function. regulate nuclear function, signals must transduced across nuclear envelope propagate signal cytoplasm nucleus. Therefore, many signaling responses induce nuclear translocation transcription factors, kinases, others. using inducible translocation trap, reporter gene-based system detect inducible nuclear translocation, found M2 isoform pyruvate kinase, key enzyme glycolysis, translocates nucleus interleukin-3, epidermal growth factor, stimulation. C domain M2 isoform pyruvate kinase sufficient interleukin-3-induced nuclear translocation. Interleukin-3-induced nuclear translocation M2 isoform pyruvate kinase dependent activation Jak2. Overexpression M2 isoform pyruvate kinase protein fused nuclear localization signal enhanced cell proliferation absence interleukin-3, suggesting nuclear pyruvate kinase plays important role cell proliferation.
