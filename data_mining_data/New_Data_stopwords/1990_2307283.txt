 Xenopus laevis oocytes embryos glycogenic cells, metabolizing sugar phosphates glycogen. cells low pyruvate kinase activity vivo and, consequently, make little pyruvate lactate glycolysis. Nevertheless, oocytes embryos contain significant pyruvate lactate levels. determine source carbon sugar phosphates pyruvate, 14C-labeled intermediary metabolites injected fertilized eggs metabolism examined thin-layer chromatography. Alanine, pyruvate, lactate form pool carbon fluxes sugar phosphates. Cytosolic (nonmitochondrial) aspartate, oxaloacetate, malate form pool carbon largely blocked short-term entering smaller alanine/pyruvate/lactate pool. data indicate major source carbon sugar phosphates fertilized eggs rapidly cleaving embryos alanine/pyruvate/lactate pool. Pyruvate pool converted mitochondria phosphoenolpyruvate, turn metabolized outside mitochondria sugar phosphates. key enzyme regulating flux amino acid carbon pyruvate malic enzyme. Three malic enzyme isozymes, one soluble two mitochondrial, partially isolated kinetically characterized total ovarian tissue. Full-grown oocytes eggs, however, low soluble malic enzyme activity, results separation cytosolic aspartate/oxaloacetate/malate alanine/pyruvate/lactate pools.
