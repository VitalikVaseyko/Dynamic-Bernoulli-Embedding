 Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) catalyzes production 2-hydroxyglutarate also elicits additional metabolic changes. Levels glutamate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity shown affected U87 glioblastoma cells normal human astrocyte (NHA) cells expressing mutant IDH1, compared cells expressing wild-type IDH1. study, show phenomena linked effects IDH1 mutation, also reprograms pyruvate metabolism. Reduced PDH activity U87 glioblastoma NHA IDH1 mutant cells associated relative increases PDH inhibitory phosphorylation, expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3, levels hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha. PDH activity monitored cells hyperpolarized (13)C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((13)C-MRS), revealed reduction metabolism hyperpolarized 2-(13)C-pyruvate 5-(13)C-glutamate, relative cells expressing wild-type IDH1. (13)C-MRS also revealed reduction glucose flux glutamate IDH1 mutant cells. Notably, pharmacological activation PDH cell exposure dichloroacetate (DCA) increased production hyperpolarized 5-(13)C-glutamate IDH1 mutant cells. Furthermore, DCA treatment also abrogated clonogenic advantage conferred IDH1 mutation. Using patient-derived mutant IDH1 neurosphere models, showed PDH activity essential cell proliferation. Taken together, results established IDH1 mutation induces MRS-detectable reprogramming pyruvate metabolism, essential cell proliferation clonogenicity, immediate therapeutic implications.
