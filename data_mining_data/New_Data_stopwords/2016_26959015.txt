 several years, oncostatic antiproliferative properties, well thoses cell death induction 5-methoxy-N-acetiltryptamine melatonin treatment, known. Paradoxically, remarkable scavenger, cytoprotective anti-apoptotic characteristics neurodegeneration models, Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease known too. Analogous results confirmed large literature associated use many bioactive molecules resveratrol, tocopherol derivatives vitamin E others. interesting note two opposite situations, namely neoplastic pathology neurodegeneration, characterized deep alterations metabolome, mitochondrial function oxygen consumption, oncostatic cytoprotective action find potential rationalization different metabolic mitochondrial situations, effect molecules exercise mitochondrial function. review discuss historical general aspects melatonin, relations cancers metabolome neurodegeneration metabolome, possible effects melatonin bioactive molecules metabolic mitochondrial dynamics. Finally, suggest common general mechanism responsible oncostatic/cytoprotective effect melatonin molecules examined.
