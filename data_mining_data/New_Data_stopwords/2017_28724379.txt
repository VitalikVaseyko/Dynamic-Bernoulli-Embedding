 BACKGROUND: Changes glucose energy metabolism contribute altered phenotype cancer cells basis positron emission tomography (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) visualize tumors vivo. molecular background enhanced glucose uptake regulation lymphoma cells fully clarified may provide new possibilities reverse altered metabolism. Thus study investigated regulation glucose uptake different signaling pathways. Furthermore, effect glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) alone combination inhibitors cell survival studied. METHODS: FDG uptake assay established uptake FDG lymphoma cells determined incubation inhibitors c-MYC PI3K signalling pathways known activated lymphoma cells able regulate glucose metabolism. Inhibitors MAPK signalling pathways whose role altered metabolism still unclear also investigated. Expression mRNAs glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 2 (HK2), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) glucose metabolism-regulating micro RNAs (miRNA) miR21, -23a, -133a, -133b, -138-1 -143 determined RT-PCR. Cell viability analysed MTT assay. RESULTS: Treatment c-MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 inhibitors PI3K/mTOR pathway diminished uptake FDG three cell lines, inhibition MAPK pathways effect glucose uptake. Expression glycolysis-related genes miRNAs diminished, although variable degree three cell lines. c-MYC inhibitor, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin 2-DG diminished number viable cells. Interestingly, combination 2-DG, c-MYC inhibitor, LY294002 p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 synergistic effects cell viability three cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: c-MYC- PI3K/mTOR-inhibitors decreased viability lymphoma cells led decreased glucose uptake, expression glycolysis-associated genes, glucose metabolism-regulating miRNAs. Inhibition HK 2-DG reduced cell numbers single agent synergistically inhibitors intracellular pathways. Thus, targeted inhibition pathways investigated could strategy suppress glycolytic phenotype lymphoma cells reduce proliferation.
