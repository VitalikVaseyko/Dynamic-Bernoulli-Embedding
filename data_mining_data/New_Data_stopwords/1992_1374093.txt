 Four monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific L-type isoenzyme rat pyruvate kinase (L-PK) produced characterized. detect least two different epitopes isoenzyme, shown interference binding assay Western blot analysis peptide mapping. MAb used immunohistology demonstrate L-PK isoenzyme paraffin-embedded normal rat tissues. L-PK found hepatocytes, kidney proximal tubules, islet cells pancreas, epithelial cells villi small intestine. content L-PK hepatocytes often lower periportal areas compared periveneous zone. kidneys clearcut difference L-PK content distribution existed male female rats. Male animals possessed L-PK kidney cortex females. L-PK content inner cortical zone (straight proximal tubules) higher outer cortical zone (convoluted proximal tubules) kidneys males. contrast, female rats displayed less L-PK inner outer cortical zone kidneys. exhibited amount isoenzyme parts kidney proximal tubules.
