 Rapidly proliferating cells switch oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis plus glutaminolysis, markedly increasing glucose glutamine catabolism. Although Otto Warburg first described aerobic glycolysis cancer cells >90 years ago, primary purpose metabolic switch remains controversial. hexosamine biosynthetic pathway requires glucose glutamine de novo synthesis UDP-GlcNAc, sugar-nucleotide inhibits receptor endocytosis signaling promoting N-acetylglucosamine branching Asn (N)-linked glycans. Here, report aerobic glycolysis glutaminolysis co-operatively reduce UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis N-glycan branching mouse cell blasts starving hexosamine pathway glucose glutamine. drives growth pro-inflammatory TH17 anti-inflammatory-induced regulatory (iTreg) differentiation, latter promoting endocytic loss IL-2 receptor-alpha (CD25). Thus, primary function aerobic glycolysis glutaminolysis co-operatively limit metabolite supply N-glycan biosynthesis, activity widespread implications autoimmunity cancer.
