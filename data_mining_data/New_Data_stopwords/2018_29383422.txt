 Excessive copper intake lead neurotoxicity, lack comprehensive understanding potential impact copper exposure especially low-dose brain. used 3xTg-AD mice explore potential neurotoxicity chronic, low-dose copper treatment (0.13 ppm copper chloride drinking water) behavior brain hippocampal mitochondrial nuclear proteome. Low-dose copper increased spatial memory impairment animals, increased accumulation intracellular amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), decreased ATP content, increased positive staining 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG), marker DNA oxidative damage, caused apoptosis decrease synaptic proteins. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) revealed modulation 24 hippocampal mitochondrial proteins (14 increased 10 decreased) copper-treated vs. untreated 3xTg-AD mice. Nuclear proteomic analysis revealed 43 modulated hippocampal nuclear proteins (25 increased 18 decreased) copper-treated 3xTg-AD vs. untreated mice. Classification modulated mitochondrial nuclear proteins included functional categories energy metabolism, synaptic-related proteins, DNA damage apoptosis-related proteins, oxidative stress-related proteins. Among differentially expressed mitochondrial nuclear proteins, nine proteins abnormally expressed hippocampus mitochondria nuclei, including electron transport chain-related proteins NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 10 (NDUAA), cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit Rieske (UCRI), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B (COX5B), ATP synthase subunit (ATP5H), glycolytic-related pyruvate kinase PKM (KPYM) pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha (ODPA). Furthermore, found coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), endogenous mitochondrial protective factor/antioxidant, modulated expression 12 differentially expressed hippocampal proteins (4 increased 8 decreased), could classified functional categories glycolysis synaptic-related proteins, oxidative stress-related proteins, implying CoQ10 improved synaptic function, suppress oxidative stress, regulate glycolysis. proteomics study, validated expression several proteins related synapses, DNA apoptosis. data confirmed synapsin-2, synaptic-related protein, significantly decreased mitochondria nuclei copper-exposed 3xTg-AD mice. mitochondria, dynamin-1 (DYN1), apoptosis-related proteins, significantly decreased. cellular nuclei, paraspeckle protein 1 (PSPC1) purin-rich element-binding protein alpha (Puralpha), two DNA damage-related proteins, significantly decreased increased, respectively. conclude low-dose copper exposure exacerbates spatial memory impairment 3xTg-AD mice perturbs multiple biological/pathogenic processes dysregulating mitochondrial nuclear proteome. Exposure copper might therefore contribute evolution AD.
