 aim study analyze significance glucose metabolism-related enzymes proliferation gastric cancer hypoxia. Four hypoxia-resistant gastric cancer cell lines four parent cell lines used. Reverse transcription-PCR used evaluate mRNA expression levels following metabolism-related enzymes: pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), glutaminase (GLS), enolase 1 (ENO1), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), PKM1. effects enzymes proliferation gastric cancer cells examined using siRNAs, shikonin PKM2 inhibitor, BPTES GLS inhibitor, vitro vivo. Levels PKM2 GLS mRNA significantly high hypoxia-resistant cell lines, compared parent cells. Knockdown PKM2 GLS significantly decreased proliferation hypoxia-resistant cells. combination siPKM2 siGLS significantly decreased proliferation compared treatment siPKM2 siGLS alone. knockdown ENO1, G6PDH, PKM1 decrease proliferation hypoxia-resistant cells. Combination treatment using shikonin BPTES inhibited proliferation hypoxia-resistant cancer cells either agent alone. vivo study indicated tumor size treated combination shikonin BPTES significantly smaller vehicle-treated group. findings suggested PKM2 GLS might play important roles proliferation hypoxic gastric cancer cells. combination PKM2 GLS inhibitors could therapeutically promising treatment gastric cancer.
