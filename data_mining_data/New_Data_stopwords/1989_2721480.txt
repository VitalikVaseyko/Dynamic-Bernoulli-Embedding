 Male Wistar rats exposed 0.2 ppm ozone (O3) 14 days intervals alveolar macrophages collected bronchoalveolar lavage examine effects O3. specific activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione peroxidase alveolar macrophages increased 1.6-fold (on 3rd day) 1.5-fold (on 5th day), respectively, control values. Similarly, specific activities pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase also increased 1.6-fold, 1.4-fold, 1.2-fold, respectively, control values 3rd day. activities enzymes tested maintained significantly higher levels 14th day. Furthermore, incorporation [14C]thymidine alveolar macrophages increased twice control values 1st 3rd days almost completely inhibited addition 1.23 x 10(-4) aphidicolin, competitive inhibitor DNA polymerase alpha. number alveolar macrophages collected exposed animals also increased 1.5-fold control value 3rd day maintained significantly higher level 14th day. noted alveolar macrophages small size preferentially increased 5th 14th days. results show exposures 0.2 ppm O3 induced metabolic enhancement peroxidative metabolism, glycolysis, DNA synthesis alveolar macrophages increased macrophages small size.
