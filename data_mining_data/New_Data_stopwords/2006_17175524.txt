 Pantothenate synthetase (PS; EC 6.3.2.1), encoded panC gene, catalyzes essential adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent condensation D-pantoate beta-alanine form pantothenate bacteria, yeast, plants; pantothenate key precursor biosynthesis coenzyme (CoA) acyl carrier protein (ACP). enzyme absent mammals CoA ACP essential cofactors bacterial growth, PS attractive chemotherapeutic target. automated high-throughput screen developed identify drugs inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis PS. activity PS measured spectrophotometrically enzymatic cascade involving myokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase. rate PS ATP utilization quantitated reduction absorbance due oxidation NADH NAD+ lactate dehydrogenase, allowed internal control detect interference compounds absorb 340 nm. coupled enzymatic reaction used screen 4080 compounds 96-well format. discussion describes novel inhibitor PS exhibits potential antimicrobial agent.
