 AIMS: study aimed evaluate effects Mn(2+) Mg(2+) lactic acid production using response surface methodology study effects interactions enzymes substrates along hexose monophosphate pathway using molecular modelling approach. METHODS RESULTS: rotatable central composite design matrix lactic acid production generated two independent factors namely, manganese sulfate magnesium sulfate. second-order regression model indicated quadratic model significant (P < 0.05), suggesting model accurately represented data experimental region. Three-dimensional response surface showed lactic acid production high along region ratio MnSO4 MgSO4 almost 1 : 1, justifying need Mg(2+) Mn(2+) present simultaneously stimulating production lactic acid. Molecular docking simulation performed total 13 essential enzymes involved hexose monophosphate pathway production lactic acid four different conditions namely presence Mg(2+) , Mn(2+) , Mg(2+) Mn(2+) absence metal ions. Results showed presence Mg(2+) Mn(2+) within binding site improved binding affinity substrates five enzymes namely, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphopyruvate hydratase pyruvate kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Using response surface methodology molecular modelling approach, illustrated Mg(2+) Mn(2+) synergistically enhanced lactic acid production Lactobacillus rhamnosus FTDC 8313 via affecting different stages hexose monophosphate pathway. SIGNIFICANCE IMPACTS STUDY: Mg(2+) Mn(2+) synergistically improved lactic acid production Lact. rhamnosus via improved binding affinity enzyme-substrate along hexose monophosphate pathway, instead purely affecting growth previously understood.
