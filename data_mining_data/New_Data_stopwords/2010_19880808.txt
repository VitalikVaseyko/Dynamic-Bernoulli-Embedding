 Although glucocorticoids widely used antiinflammatory agents clinical therapies, may cause serious side effects include insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia. study potential functional adaptations islet Langerhans vivo glucocorticoid treatment, adult Wistar rats received dexamethasone (DEX) 5 consecutive days, whereas controls (CTL) received saline. analysis insulin release freshly isolated islets showed enhanced secretion response glucose DEX-treated rats. study Ca(2+) signals fluorescence microscopy also demonstrated higher response glucose islets DEX-treated animals. However, differences Ca(2+) signals found groups tolbutamide KCl, indicating alterations probably related metabolism. Thus, mitochondrial function explored monitoring oxidation nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate autofluorescence mitochondrial membrane potential. parameters revealed higher response glucose islets DEX-treated rats. mRNA protein content glucose transporter-2, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase similar groups, indicating changes proteins probably involved increased mitochondrial function. Additionally, explored status Ca(2+)-dependent signaling kinases. Unlike calmodulin kinase II, found augmented phosphorylation level protein kinase C alpha well increased response phospholipase C/inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate pathway DEX-treated rats. Finally, increased number docked secretory granules observed beta-cells DEX animals using transmission electron microscopy. Thus, results demonstrate islets glucocorticoid-treated rats develop several adaptations lead enhanced stimulus-secretion coupling secretory capacity.
