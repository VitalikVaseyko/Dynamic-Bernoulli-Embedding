 Cancer cells gain growth advantage so-called Warburg effect shifting glucose metabolism oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) suggested function metabolic reprogramming; however, underlying mechanism fully elucidated. found aberrant expression wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 3alpha (IDH3alpha), subunit IDH3 heterotetramer, decreased alpha-ketoglutarate levels increased stability transactivation activity HIF-1alpha cancer cells. silencing IDH3alpha significantly delayed tumor growth suppressing HIF-1-mediated Warburg effect angiogenesis. IDH3alpha expression associated poor postoperative overall survival lung breast cancer patients. results justify exploitation IDH3 novel target diagnosis treatment cancers.
