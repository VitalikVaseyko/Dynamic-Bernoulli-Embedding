 BACKGROUND: CD147 (basigin, EMMPRIN) multifunctional, highly conserved glycoprotein enriched pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) associated poor prognosis many malignancies. role CD147 pancreatic cancer, however, remains elusive. METHODS RESULTS: Silencing CD147 RNA interference (RNAi) reduced proliferation rate MiaPaCa2 Panc1 cells. CD147 required function expression monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 MCT4 expressed human PDAC cells demonstrated real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) well immunohistology. MCT1 MCT4 natural transporters lactate, MiaPaCa2 cells exhibited high rate lactate production, characteristic Warburg effect, early hallmark cancer confers significant growth advantage. induction lactate production sodium azide MiaPaCa2 cells increased MCT1 well MCT4 expression. CD147 silencing inhibited expression function MCT1 MCT4 resulted increased intracellular lactate concentration. Addition exogenous lactate inhibited cancer cell growth dose-dependent fashion. vivo, knock-down CD147 MiaPaCa2 cells inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated CD147 silencing reduced invasiveness chorioallantoic membrane chick embryos (CAM assay) inhibited tumourigenicity xenograft model nude mice. CONCLUSION: function CD147 ancillary protein required sustain expression function MCT1 MCT4 involved association CD147 expression malignant potential pancreatic cancer cells exhibiting Warburg effect.
