 Reprogrammed energy metabolism emerging hallmark cancer. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), key enzyme involved anaerobic glycolysis, frequently deregulated human malignancies. However, limited knowledge known roles progression osteosarcoma (OS). study, found LDHA commonly upregulated four OS cell lines compared normal osteoblast cells (hFOB1.19). Treatment FX11, specific inhibitor LDHA, significantly reduced LDHA activity, inhibited cell proliferation invasive potential dose dependent manner. Genetic silencing LDHA resulted decreased lactate level culture medium, reduced cell viability decreased cell invasion ability. Meanwhile, silencing LDHA also compromised tumorigenesis vivo. Furthermore, knockdown LDHA remarkably reduced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) well glucose consumption. presence 2-DG, glycolysis inhibitor, LDHA-mediated cell proliferation invasion completely blocked, indicating oncogenic activities LDHA may dependent Warburg effect. Finally, pharmacological inhibition c-Myc HIF1alpha significantly attenuated LDHA expression. Taken together, upregulated LDHA facilitates tumor progression OS might potential target OS treatment.
