 PURPOSE: Malignant astrocytomas exhibit constitutive Akt phosphorylation due reduced phosphatase tensin homologue (PTEN) tumor suppressor expression increased growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Many astrocytomas also tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) protein deficient exhibit constitutive mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Astrocytomas harboring PTEN/Akt/TSC2 pathway mutations dependent glycolysis satisfy bioenergetic requirements. Therapies disrupt energy homeostasis potentially manage astrocytoma growth progression. Although dietary restriction (DR) reduces glycolysis manages early-stage astrocytoma growth, prior studies identified mechanisms involved determined DR also manage late-stage tumor growth. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: effects late-onset intermittent DR feeding paradigm examined adult C57BL/6J mice bearing syngeneic CT-2A malignant astrocytoma grown orthotopically subcutaneously. RESULTS: contrast contralateral normal brain, CT-2A PTEN/TSC2 protein deficient; exhibited constitutive Akt, mTOR, BAD phosphorylation; overexpressed insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-I receptor, hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), type 1 glucose transporter protein (GLUT1), pyruvate kinase. DR initiated 10 14 days tumor implantation (late onset) reduced CT-2A growth, delayed malignant progression, significantly extended survival. DR suppressed phosphorylation Akt BAD reducing expression IGF-I, HIF-1alpha, GLUT1. DR also enhanced procaspase-9/procaspase-3 cleavage effect mTOR phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: findings indicate IGF-I/Akt signaling associated antiapoptotic glycolytic phenotype CT-2A astrocytoma DR targets pathway. Moreover, PTEN/TSC2 deficiency may impair adaptation DR-induced disruption energy homeostasis, thus enhancing apoptosis. findings highlight efficacy late-onset DR managing astrocytoma growth suggest DR may effective broad-spectrum inhibitor Akt signaling PTEN/TSC2-deficient astrocytomas.
