 High pressure (100-150 MPa) increases intensity polarization fluorescence FITC-labeled Ca(2+)-ATPase medium containing 0.1 mM Ca2+, suggesting reversible pressure-induced transition E1 E2-like state dissociation ATPase oligomers. similar conditions using unlabeled sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, high pressure caused reversible release Ca2+ high-affinity Ca2+ sites Ca(2+)-ATPase, indicated changes fluorescence Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-3; accompanied reversible inhibition Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activity measured coupled enzyme system pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, redistribution Prodan lipid phase membrane, shown marked changes fluorescence emission characteristics. Ca(2+)-free medium equilibrium favors E2 conformation Ca(2+)-ATPase fluorescence intensity FITC-ATPase affected slightly reduced high pressure. enhancement TNP-AMP fluorescence 100 mM inorganic phosphate presence EGTA 20% dimethylsulfoxide essentially unaffected 150 MPa pressure pH 6.0 slightly reduced pH 8.0. enhancement TNP-AMP fluorescence Pi associated Mg(2+)-dependent phosphorylation enzyme formation Mg.E2-P intermediate, appears reactions Ca(2+)-ATPase associated E2 state relatively insensitive high pressure. observations suggest high pressure stabilizes enzyme E2-like state characterized low reactivity ATP Ca2+ high reactivity Pi. transition E1 E2-like state involves decrease effective volume Ca(2+)-ATPase.
