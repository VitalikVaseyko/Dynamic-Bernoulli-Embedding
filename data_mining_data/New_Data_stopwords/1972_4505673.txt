 Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) inhibited phenethylbiguanide. kinetics inhibition competitive biguanide divalent, monovalent, metal cation activators enzyme; biguanide inhibition thus resembles inhibition Ca(++). Alteration either polar nonpolar portion phenethylbiguanide molecule quantitatively reduces effectiveness inhibitor pyruvate kinase, kinetics inhibition remain qualitatively unchanged. Measurements [(3)H]phenethylbiguanide binding enzyme indicate presence single class 12 binding sites per enzyme molecule; binding characteristics significantly different presence either monovalent divalent metal cations. Studies (45)Ca(++) (54)Mn(++) demonstrate 4 metal binding sites per enzyme molecule; phenethylbiguanide displaces metal cations enzyme. Studies several enzymes, dependent upon divalent metal cations, metal-bridge substrate-bridge classes fail show significant inhibition except much higher phenethylbiguanide concentrations.
