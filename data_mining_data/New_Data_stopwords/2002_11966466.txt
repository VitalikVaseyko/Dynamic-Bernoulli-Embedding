 Glycolysis considered promising target new drugs parasitic trypanosomatid protozoa, pathway plays essential role ATP supply. Trypanosomatid glycolysis unique compartmentalised, many enzymes display specific structural kinetic features. Structure- catalytic mechanism-based approaches applied design compounds inhibit glycolytic enzymes parasites without affecting corresponding proteins human host. trypanosomatid enzymes, potent selective inhibitors already developed affect growth cultured trypanosomatids, mammalian cells. Examples developed concerning enzymes hexoses part also others concerning glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate-kinase trioses part. Concerning cysteine protease inhibitor development, great number irreversible alkylating agents shown efficacy towards active site cysteine parasite proteases. includes fluoromethylketones, epoxides, diazomethylketones, vinylsulfones mention few. functional groups activated electrophiles react nucleophilic cysteine active site generally quite selective cysteine versus serine. thought also reactive numerous nucleophiles body, especially thiols. potentially hampering property seems detrimental two reasons: first recent report shown cysteine protease inhibitors containing vinylsulfone electrophile unreactive towards thiols glutathione considered inert absence catalytic machinery. Secondly, irreversible inhibitors shown less toxic presumed parasite treatment, owing bioselectivity displayed parasite itself.
