 Vanadium compounds exert various insulin-mimetic anti-diabetic effects vitro vivo. Vanadium(III, IV, V)-chlorodipicolinate (Vdipic-Cl) compounds, including H[V(III)(dipic-Cl)2].5H2O (V3dipic-Cl), V(IV)O(dipic-Cl)(H2O)2 (V4dipic-Cl) K[V(V)O2(dipic-Cl)] (V5dipic-Cl), synthesized indicated oxidation states. present study conducted investigate chemical valence anti-oxidation effects vanadium compounds involved anti-diabetic effects observed streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats treated vanadium compounds. V3dipic-Cl, V4dipic-Cl, V5dipic-Cl, inorganic vanadium salts vanadyl sulfate (VOSO4) sodium metavanadate (NaVO3) orally administered drinking water (50 mugV/ml) STZ-induced diabetic rats 28 days. results showed Vdipic-Cl treatment significantly improved hyperglycemia glucose intolerance, well increased hepatic glycogen synthesis diabetic rats. mRNA levels key glycolytic enzymes liver, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucokinase (GK), L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) altered diabetic animals significantly restored towards normal values treatment vanadium compounds. Moreover, diabetes elevated activities aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) serum significantly decreased treatment Vdipic-Cl complexes. Furthermore, treatment diabetic rats V4dipic-Cl V5dipic-Cl compounds significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production increased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) catalase (CAT) activities. data suggest vanadium compounds indicated chemical valence promote glycogen synthesis recover suppressed glycolysis liver diabetic rats due capacity reduce oxidative stress stimulating antioxidant enzymes.
