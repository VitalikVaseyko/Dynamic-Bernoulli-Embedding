 use vitro insulin releasing system, new insights meechanisms underlying insulin exocytotic process gained. proposed insulin release initiated glucose interacting glucoreceptor plasma membrane. properties receptor discussed. postulated initiation secretion, continued insulin release control phosphorylated intermediates glucose metabolism, i.e. glucose-6-phosphate phosphoenol pyruvate, operating via membrane-bound protein kinase. initiation insulin release glucose, augmentation initiation mentioned intermediates, viewed modified cascade system. cascade theory insulin secretion postulated alternative threshold distribution hypothesis insulin secretion. action tolbutamide relation two pool theory insulin secretion discussed.
