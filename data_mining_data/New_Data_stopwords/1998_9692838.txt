 Tumor tissue oxygenation impacts proliferation cancer cells sensitivity towards radio- chemotherapy. low oxygen, mammalian cells show adaptive response leads induction number genes well-defined roles oxygen supply energy maintenance, e.g. genes encoding enzymes glycolytic pathway. hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), transcription factor consisting two proteins HIF-1alpha HIF-1beta, plays major role pleiotropic response observed low oxygen. determined, Northern analysis, mRNA levels HIF-1alpha two glycolytic enzymes known transcriptionally activated HIF-1, namely phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK 1) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), different hepatoma cell lines mouse human tissues. Hypoxic treatment various mouse human hepatoma cell lines led expected increase amount PGK1 PKM2 mRNA, HIF-1alpha mRNA levels significantly elevated. Analysis mouse liver tumors demonstrated tumor-specific increases HIF-1alpha PGK1 mRNA levels. five eight human colorectal cancers investigated, PGK1 PKM2 mRNA levels increased comparison corresponding normal tissues, HIF-1alpha mRNA levels significantly changed. majority colorectal cancers demonstrated p53 immunoreactivity, presumably due mutation gene; was, however, correlation p53 staining pattern mRNA expression levels glycolytic enzymes.
