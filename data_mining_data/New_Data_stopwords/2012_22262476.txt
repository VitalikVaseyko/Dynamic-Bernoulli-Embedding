 Proliferating cells adapt metabolism support conversion available nutrients biomass. cell metabolism regulated balance production ATP, metabolite building blocks, reducing equivalents remains uncertain. Proliferative metabolism often involves increased rate glycolysis. key regulated step glycolysis catalyzed pyruvate kinase convert phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate. Surprisingly, strong selection expression less active M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) tumors proliferative tissues. Cell growth signals decrease PKM2 activity, cells less active PKM2 use another pathway separate regulatory properties convert PEP pyruvate. One consequence using alternative pathway accumulation 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) leads diversion 3PG serine biosynthesis pathway. fact, cancers substantial portion total glucose flux directed toward serine synthesis, genetic evidence suggests glucose flux pathway promote cell transformation. Environmental conditions also influence pathways cells use generate biomass source carbon lipid synthesis changing based oxygen availability. Together, findings argue distinct metabolic phenotypes exist among proliferating cells, genetic environmental factors influence metabolism regulated support cell growth.
