 Tissue anoxia occurs early wound healing. accompanied production lactate followed increased hyaluronan CD44 expression, suggesting cause effect relationship. Fibroblasts increased hyaluronan CD44 lactate added cultures. Increased deposition hyaluronan correlates greater turnover. current models hyaluronan catabolism, tethered cell surfaces CD44 caveolin-enriched invaginations. cleaved 20-kDa fragments Hyal-2 plasma membrane, endocytosed, delivered ultimately lysosomes, digested Hyal-1. Sequence analyses promoter regions genes CD44, caveolin-1, Hyal-1, -2 revealed multiple AP-1 ets-1 response elements. test relevance, RNA lactate-treated fibroblasts analyzed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Increased transcripts c-fos, c-jun, c-ets, Hyal-1, -2, CD44, caveolin-1 mRNAs observed. thus identified lactate-activated genes important wound healing responses. Similar responses facilitating tumor progression, Warburg effect, may share mechanisms.
