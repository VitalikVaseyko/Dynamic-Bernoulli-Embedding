 BACKGROUND: Proteome analysis emerged valuable tool study large-scale protein expression profiles. Here, applied novel technology identify specific biomarkers acute cardiac allograft rejection. METHODS: Hearts C57BL/10 mice placed fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched C3H/He recipients. Syngeneic transplants served controls. Intragraft protein expression analysis performed using fluorescence two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis day 6 posttransplant. Spots interest subsequently subjected nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) protein identification. addition, expression selected proteins confirmed Western blot analysis immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis enabled detection 1541 protein spots. 95 protein spots, expression level acute rejection differed 1.5-fold observed syngeneic grafts. Spots significant differential regulation identified tandem mass spectrometry derived peroxiredoxin 6, pyruvate kinase isozyme M2, coronin 1A, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor, aconitate hydratase. CONCLUSION: identified proteins may constitute novel biomarkers acute cardiac allograft rejection might hold great potential surrogate markers monitoring vivo alloimmune response.
