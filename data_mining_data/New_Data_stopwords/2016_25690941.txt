 Cellular senescence modulate various pathologies associated irreparable DNA double-strand breaks (IrrDSBs). Extracellular senescence metabolomes (ESMs) generated fibroblasts rendered senescent proliferative exhaustion (PEsen) 20 Gy gamma rays (IrrDSBsen) compared young proliferating cells, confluent cells, quiescent cells, cells exposed repairable levels DNA damage identify novel noninvasive markers senescent cells. ESMs PEsen IrrDSBsen overlapped showed increased levels citrate, molecules involved oxidative stress, sterol, monohydroxylipids, tryptophan metabolism, phospholipid, nucleotide catabolism, well reduced levels dipeptides containing branched chain amino acids. ESM overlaps aging disease body fluid metabolomes, supporting utility noninvasive detection human senescent cells vivo implication detection variety human pathologies. Intracellular metabolites senescent cells showed relative increase glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose-phosphate pathway, and, consistent this, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase transcripts. contrast, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme transcript levels unchanged metabolites depleted. results surprising glycolysis antagonizes senescence entry consistent established senescent cells entering state low oxidative stress.
