 role regucalcin, regulatory protein intracellular signaling pathway, regulation glucose utilization lipid production investigated using cloned rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells overexpressing regucalcin. hepatoma cells (wild-type) stable regucalcin/pCXN2-transfected cells (transfectant) cultured 72 h medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) obtain subconfluent monolayers. Cells subconfluency cultured 24 72 h medium containing either vehicle insulin (10(-8) 10(-7) M) without supplementation glucose (10, 25, 50 mg/ml medium) absence insulin. production triglyceride free fatty acid significantly increased transfectants cultured without insulin glucose supplementation compared wild-type cells. supplementation glucose (10, 25, 50 mg/ml) caused remarkable increase medium glucose consumption, triglyceride, free fatty acid productions transfectants cultured without insulin. presence insulin (10(-7) M) caused significant increase medium glucose consumption, triglyceride, free fatty acid productions wild-type cells cultured glucose supplementation. increases significantly prevented transfectants cultured 72 h. expression acetyl-CoA carboxylase, HMG-CoA reductase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, glyceroaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) mRNAs wild-type cells significantly changed culture without glucose supplementation presence insulin. gene expressions significantly changed transfectants. expression glucose transporter 2 mRNA significantly increased transfectants compared wild-type cells. increase seen transfectants cultured presence insulin without glucose supplementation. study demonstrates overexpression regucalcin enhances glucose utilization lipid production cloned rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells, regulates effect insulin.
