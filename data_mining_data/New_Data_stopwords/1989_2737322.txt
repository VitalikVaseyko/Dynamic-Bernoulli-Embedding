 Myocardium skeletal muscle white rats number specific features metabolism carbohydrates. skeletal muscle characterized high intensity glycolytic processes glycolytic substrate phosphorylation, testified activity terminal glycolysis stage enzymes (pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, isoenzyme spectrum) content lactate pyruvate metabolites. contrast skeletal muscles, activity NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase myocardium significant cytoplasm mitochondria. activity corresponds high level malate oxaloacetate metabolites activity NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase, playing connective role glycolysis, cycle tricarboxylic acids glyconeogenesis. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, catalyzing transformation cytoplasmatic oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate active skeletal muscles intensity tricarboxylic acids cycle reactions lower activity glycolysis higher myocardium.
