 Bile acids important regulatory molecules activate specific nuclear receptors cell signaling pathways liver gastrointestinal tract. current study, chronic bile fistula (CBF) rat model primary rat hepatocytes (PRH) used study regulation gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) gene encoding short heterodimeric partner (SHP) taurocholate (TCA). intestinal infusion TCA CBF rat rapidly (1h) activated AKT (approximately 9-fold) ERK1/2 (3- 5-fold) signaling pathways, downregulated (approximately 50%, 30 min) mRNA levels PEPCK G-6-Pase, induced (14-fold 3 h) SHP mRNA. TCA rapidly ( approximately 50%, 1-2 h) downregulated PEPCK G-6-Pase mRNA levels PRH. downregulation genes TCA blocked pretreatment PRH pertussis toxin (PTX). PRH, TCA plus insulin showed significantly stronger inhibition glucose secretion/synthesis lactate pyruvate either alone. induction SHP mRNA PRH strongly blocked inhibition PI3 kinase PKCzeta specific chemical inhibitors knockdown PKCzeta siRNA encoded recombinant lentivirus. Activation insulin signaling pathway appears linked upregulation farnesoid X receptor functional activity SHP induction.
