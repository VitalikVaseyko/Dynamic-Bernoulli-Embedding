 Incubation hepatocytes 24 h-starved rats presence 0.5 mM-adenosine decreased gluconeogenesis lactate, alanine. inhibition gluconeogenesis associated stimulation ketone-body production inhibition pyruvate oxidation. metabolic changes suppressed presence iodotubercidin (an inhibitor adenosine kinase), reinforced presence deoxycoformycin (an inhibitor adenosine deaminase); 2-chloroadenosine induced change gluconeogenesis lactate. data indicate inhibition gluconeogenesis adenosine probably results conversion adenine nucleotides. presence lactate pyruvate, alanine asparagine, conversion resulted decrease [ATP]/[ADP] ratio mitochondrial cytosolic compartments. Adenosine decreased Pi concentration gluconeogenic substrates.
