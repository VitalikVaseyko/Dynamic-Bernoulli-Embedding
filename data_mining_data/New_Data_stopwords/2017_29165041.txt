 Phosphorylation major type post-translational modification, influence cellular physiological function. ATG4B, key macroautophagy/autophagy-related protein, potential effect survival tumor cells. However, role ATG4B phosphorylation cancers still unknown. study, identified novel phosphorylation site Ser34 ATG4B induced AKT HCC cells. phosphorylation ATG4B Ser34 little effect autophagic flux, promoted Warburg effect including increase L-lactate production glucose consumption, decrease oxygen consumption HCC cells. Ser34 phosphorylation ATG4B also contributed impairment mitochondrial activity including inhibition F1Fo-ATP synthase activity elevation mitochondrial ROS HCC cells. Moreover, phosphorylation ATG4B Ser34 enhanced mitochondrial location subsequent colocalization F1Fo-ATP synthase HCC cells. Furthermore, recombinant human ATG4B protein suppressed activity F1Fo-ATP synthase MgATP submitochondrial particles patient-derived HCC tissues vitro. brief, results demonstrate first time phosphorylation ATG4B Ser34 participates metabolic reprogramming HCC cells via repressing mitochondrial function, possibly results Ser34 phosphorylation-induced mitochondrial enrichment ATG4B subsequent inhibition F1Fo-ATP synthase activity. findings reveal noncanonical working pattern ATG4B pathological conditions, may provide scientific basis developing novel strategies HCC treatment targeting ATG4B Ser34 phosphorylation.
