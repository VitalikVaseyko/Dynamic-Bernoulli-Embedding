 Human erythrocytes overloaded glucose 1,6-bisphosphate prepared order establish metabolic significance phosphorylated sugar intact red cell. intracellular glucose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration increased six- twofold normal level encapsulating (i) commercially available compound (ii) glucose 1,6-bisphosphate synthase obtained rabbit skeletal muscle, respectively. experimental conditions, reduction glucose utilization loaded cells observed reequilibration steady state. steady state, concentrations glycolytic intermediates adenine nucleotides appeared substantially unmodified compared controls, exception 50% reduction glucose fructose 6-phosphate measured erythrocytes encapsulated exogenous glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. considered experimental conditions, elevated intracellular glucose 1,6-bisphosphate appears display inhibitory effect hexokinase overcomes possible activation phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase.
