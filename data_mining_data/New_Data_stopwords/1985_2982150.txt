 shown polyphosphates generated significant amounts phosphoglycerate kinase reaction; polyphosphate effective ATP formation glucose 6-P glucokinase, rate ATP may adequate meet requirements glucose metabolism; PPi far effective ATP phosphate donor formation fructose 1,6-P2 phosphofructokinase; PPi rather ATP almost certainly used reaction; and, aside glucokinase phosphofructokinase, enzymes phosphorylation specific requirements phosphate donors acceptors present adequate amounts meet requirements glucose metabolism propionic acid bacteria.
