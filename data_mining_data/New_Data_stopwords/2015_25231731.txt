 ability estrogen shield brain bioenergetic insult hypoglycemia unclear. Estradiol (E) prevents hypoglycemic activation energy deficit sensor adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) hindbrain metabolosensory A2 noradrenergic neurons. study investigates hypothesis estrogen regulates A2 AMPK control fuel metabolism and/or upstream protein kinase/phosphatase enzyme expression. A2 cells harvested laser microdissection insulin vehicle (V) injection E- oil (O)-implanted ovariectomized female rats. Cell lysates evaluated immunoblot glycolytic, tricarboxylic acid cycle, respiratory chain, acetyl-CoA-malonyl-CoA pathway enzymes. A2 phosphofructokinase (PFKL), isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, ATP synthase subunit profiles elevated E/V vs. O/V; hypoglycemia augmented PFKL alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase expression E only. Hypoglycemia increased A2 Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-beta reduced protein phosphatase groups. A2 phospho-AMPK levels equivalent O/V vs. E/V elevated hypoglycemia only. results implicate E compensatory upregulation substrate catabolism corresponding maintenance energy stability A2 metabolosensory neurons hypoglycemia, outcomes support potential viability molecular substrates hormone action targets therapies alleviating hypoglycemic brain injury.
