 BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes six nuclear transformation-associated proteins induce extensive changes cellular gene expression signaling induce B-cell transformation. role HIF1A EBV-induced B-cell immortalization previously studied. METHODS FINDINGS: Using Western blotting Q-PCR, found HIF1A protein stabilized EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells. Western blotting, GST pulldown assays, immunoprecipitation showed EBV-encoded nuclear antigens EBNA-5 EBNA-3 bind prolylhydroxylases 1 2, respectively, thus inhibiting HIF1A hydroxylation degradation. Immunostaining Q-PCR showed stabilized HIF1A translocates nucleus, forms heterodimer ARNT, transactivates several genes involved aerobic glycolysis. Using biochemical assays Q-PCR, also found lymphoblastoid cells produce high levels lactate, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate. CONCLUSIONS: data suggest activation aerobic glycolytic pathway, corresponding Warburg effect, occurs EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells, contrast mitogen-activated B-cells.
