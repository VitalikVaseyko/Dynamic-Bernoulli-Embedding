 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Desmoplasia poor vascularity cause severe metabolic stress pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Serotonin (5-HT) neuromodulator neurotransmitter neuroendocrine functions contributes tumorigenesis. investigated role 5-HT signaling growth pancreatic tumors. METHODS: measured levels proteins regulate 5-HT synthesis, packaging, degradation pancreata Kras(G12D/+)/Trp53(R172H/+)/Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mice, develop pancreatic tumors, well PDAC cell lines tissue microarray containing 81 human PDAC samples. also analyzed expression levels proteins involved 5-HT synthesis degradation immunohistochemical analysis tissue microarray containing 311 PDAC specimens, associated expression levels patient survival times. 5-HT level 14 matched PDAC tumor non-tumor tissues analyzed ELISA. PDAC cell lines incubated 5-HT cell survival apoptosis measured. analyzed expression 5-HT receptor HTR2B PDAC cells effects receptor agonists antagonists, well HTR2B knockdown small hairpin RNAs. determined effects 5-HT stimulation gene expression profiles BxPC-3 cells. Regulation glycolysis 5-HT signaling via HTR2B assessed immunofluorescence immunoprecipitation analyses, well determination extracellular acid ratio, glucose consumption, lactate production. Primary PDACs, without exposure SB204741 (a selective antagonist HTR2B), grown xenograft tumors mice, SB204741 administered tumor-bearing KPC mice; tumor growth metabolism measured imaging analyses. RESULTS: immunohistochemical analysis tissue microarray PDAC specimens, increased levels TPH1 decreased level MAOA, regulate 5-HT synthesis degradation, correlated stage size PDACs shorter patient survival time. found levels 5-HT increased human PDAC tissues compared non-tumor pancreatic tissues, PDAC cell lines compared non-transformed pancreatic cells. Incubation PDAC cell lines 5-HT increased proliferation prevented apoptosis. Agonists HTR2B, 5-HT receptors, promoted proliferation prevented apoptosis PDAC cells. Knockdown HTR2B PDAC cells, incubation cells HTR2B inhibitors, reduced growth xenograft tumors mice. observed correlation 5-HT glycolytic flux PDAC cells; levels metabolic enzymes involved glycolysis, phosphate pentose pathway, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway increased significantly PDAC cells following 5-HT stimulation. 5-HT stimulation led formation HTR2B-LYN-p85 complex, increased PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling Warburg effect increasing protein levels MYC HIF1A. Administration SB204741 KPC mice slowed growth metabolism established pancreatic tumors prolonged survival mice. CONCLUSIONS: Human PDACs increased levels 5-HT, PDAC cells increase expression receptor, HTR2B. increases allow tumor glycolysis metabolic stress promote growth pancreatic tumors PDAC xenograft tumors mice.
