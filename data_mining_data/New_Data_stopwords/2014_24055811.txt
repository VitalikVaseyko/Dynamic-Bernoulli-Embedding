 glucose-responsive transcription factor carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) plays important role regulating glucose metabolism support anabolic synthesis hepatocytes cancer cells. order investigate molecular mechanism ChREBP regulates transcription, used proteomic approach identify proteins interacting ChREBP. found several potential ChREBP-interacting partners, one which, flightless homolog (FLII) verified interact co-localize ChREBP HCT116 colorectal cancer HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. FLII member gelsolin superfamily actin-remodeling proteins function transcriptional co-regulator. C-terminal 227 amino acid region ChREBP containing DNA-binding domain interacted FLII. N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain C-terminal gelsolin homolog domain (GLD) FLII interacted co-localized ChREBP. ChREBP FLII localized cytoplasm nucleus cancer cells. Glucose increased expression nuclear localization ChREBP, minimal effect level distribution FLII. FLII knockdown using siRNAs increased mRNA protein levels ChREBP-activated genes decreased transcription ChREBP-repressed genes cancer cells. Conversely, FLII overexpression negatively regulated ChREBP-mediated transcription cancer cells. findings suggest FLII component ChREBP transcriptional complex negatively regulates ChREBP function cancer cells.
