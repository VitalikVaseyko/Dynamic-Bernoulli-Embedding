 AIMS: Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor induced wide range stimuli, including hyperglycaemia pro-inflammatory cytokines. associated cardiac hypertrophy heart failure. previously reported NF-kappaB-mediated inhibition proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) might explain shift glucose metabolism cardiac pathological processes induced pro-inflammatory stimuli, although specific mechanisms remain elucidated. addressed specific mechanisms exposure tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) results PGC-1alpha down-regulation cardiac cells and, consequence, metabolic dysregulation underlies heart dysfunction failure. METHODS RESULTS: using coimmunoprecipitation studies, report first time p65 subunit NF-kappaB constitutively bound PGC-1alpha human cardiac cells also mouse heart, NF-kappaB activation TNF-alpha exposure increases binding. Overexpression gene silencing analyses demonstrated main factor limiting degree association p65, modulation protein modified physical interaction. data show increased physical interaction p65 PGC-1alpha NF-kappaB activation responsible reduction PGC-1alpha expression subsequent dysregulation glucose oxidation. CONCLUSION: basis data, propose p65 directly represses PGC-1alpha activity cardiac cells, thereby leading reduction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) expression subsequent increase glucose oxidation observed proinflammatory state.
