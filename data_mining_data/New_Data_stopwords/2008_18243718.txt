 INTRODUCTION: Increased aerobic glycolysis one common abnormalities occurring metabolism tumour cells pyruvate kinase one key glycolytic enzymes. dimeric form M2-pyruvate kinase, found predominantly tumour cells, designated tumour M2-pyruvate kinase (TuM2-PK). aim present, prospective study evaluate diagnostic relevance TuM2-PK detecting oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). MATERIAL METHODS: TuM2-PK concentration analysed ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid plasma 80 untreated patients histologically confirmed OSCC stages T3 T4, whilst 90 patients non-malignant diseases served controls. analysis done using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ScheBo Biotech AG, Giessen, Germany). Immunohistochemical detection TuM2-PK performed specific mouse monoclonal antibody DF-4. RESULTS: median TuM2-PK concentration 22.92U/ml tumour group 10.00U/ml control group (p<0.001). Using 15U/ml cut-off yielded sensitivity 63% specificity 59%. Moreover, positive negative predictive values 57% 64%, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining tissue sections showed TuM2-PK selectively expressed tumour cells also non-malignant cells, particularly regenerative ones. CONCLUSION: Low sensitivity specificity stages T3 T4 OSCC render TuM2-PK test unsuitable tool detecting OSCC, particularly early stage. Thus, routine clinical radiological follow-up indispensable treatment OSCC.
