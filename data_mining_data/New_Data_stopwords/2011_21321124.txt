 Diabetic cardiac dysfunction associated decreased rates myocardial glucose oxidation (GO) increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO), fuel shift shown sensitize heart ischemic insult ventricular dysfunction. sought evaluate metabolic functional consequences chronic suppression GO heart modeled transgenic mice cardiac-specific overexpression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (myosin heavy chain (MHC)-PDK4 mice), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase. Hearts MHC-PDK4 mice shown exhibit insulin-resistant substrate utilization profile, characterized low GO rates high FAO flux. Surprisingly, MHC-PDK4 mice sensitized cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury despite fuel utilization pattern phenocopied diabetic heart. addition, MHC-PDK4 mice protected high fat diet-induced myocyte lipid accumulation, likely related increased capacity FAO. high rates mitochondrial FAO MHC-PDK4 heart related heightened activity AMP-activated protein kinase, reduced levels malonyl-CoA, increased capacity mitochondrial uncoupled respiration. expression known AMP-activated protein kinase target, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), master regulator mitochondrial function biogenesis, also activated MHC-PDK4 heart. results demonstrate chronic activation PDK4 triggers transcriptional post-transcriptional mechanisms re-program heart chronic high rates FAO without expected deleterious functional metabolic consequences.
