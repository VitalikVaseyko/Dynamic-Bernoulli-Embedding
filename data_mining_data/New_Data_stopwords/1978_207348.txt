 Interaction several enzymes (pyruvate kinase, myokinase, creatine kinase, aldolase, malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) proteins (bovine serum albumin ovalbumin) Blue Dextran studied means affinity electrophoresis polyacrylamide gels. decrease electrophoretic mobility enzymes affinity gels dependent Blue Dextran concentration cases, dissociation constants protein-immobilized dye complexes could calculated. Affinity electrophoresis presence Blue Dextran reveals cases additional bands isoenzymes, compared control gels (without Blue Dextran).
