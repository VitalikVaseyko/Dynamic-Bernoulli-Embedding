 effects 100 g/kg diet substitution bagasse body-weight gain, food consumption faecal dry weight mice given high-sucrose diet activities hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC I.I.I.49), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC I.I.I.44), malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+) (EC I.I.I.40), ATP-citrate (pro-3S) lyase (EC 4.I.3.8), 6-phosphofructokinase EC 2.7.I.II), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.I.40) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.I.3.II) studied. Bagasse effect body-weight gain, food consumption faecal dry weight. Bagasse decreased activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase phosphofructokinase expressed wet weight basis protein basis. Bagasse decreased activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase expressed body-weight basis. results suggest bagasse decreases flux pathways hepatic lipogenesis mice given high-sucrose diets.
