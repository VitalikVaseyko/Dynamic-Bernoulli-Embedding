 1. Isolated kidney cortex tubules prepared fed rats incubated near-physiological concentrations [(14)C]lactate decrease specific radioactivity added lactate. effect may attributable least two mechanisms; formation lactate endogenous precursors, entry unlabelled carbon lactate pool result substrate cycling, via phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate oxaloacetate, together equilibration oxaloacetate pool malate fumarate. substrate cycling could occur within single cell, two populations different cells, one glycolytic gluconeogenic. possibilities investigated using metabolic inhibitors alternative metabolic substrates. 2. Tubules fed rats produced fall specific radioactivity 14.4% incubated 40min 2mm-lactate alone. mathematical treatment result presented, allows rate fall specific radioactivity expressed addition unlabelled lactate pool. corresponds rate formation unlabelled lactate 121+/-22mumol/h per g dry wt., rate close gluconeogenesis. tubules fasting rats, reduction specific radioactivity lactate, indicating fasting 24h suppresses production unlabelled-lactate carbon. 3. Addition 2mm-fumarate resulted significantly greater decrease specific radioactivity lactate, aspartate (2mm), malate (2mm) glucose (5mm) without effect. Total inhibition gluconeogenesis 3-mercaptopicolinate prevent fall specific radioactivity lactate observed tubules fed-rat kidney, thereby excluding significant activity substrate cycle pyruvate-->oxaloacetate-->phosphoenolpyruvate-->pyruvate. 4. capacity pyruvate kinase test conditions tubules prepared kidneys fed starved rats least ten times higher observed rate production lactate, failure observe recycling lactate starved-rat tubules indicates suppression pyruvate kinase activity. 5. endogenous glycogen glucose content isolated renal cortex tubules low account dilution label lactate. Endogenous concentrations glycerol amino acids also low. glycogen, possibility rapid turnover metabolites, fed rats starved rats, may account formation unlabelled lactate cannot excluded. 6. concluded substrate cycling via phosphoenolpyruvate occur significant extent either fed starved-rat kidney. fed rats recycling lactate carbon occur rate reaction similar rate gluconeogenesis physiological concentrations lactate. present results favour participation oxaloacetate decarboxylase rather ;malic' enzyme cycle.
