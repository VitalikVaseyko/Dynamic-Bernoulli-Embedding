 Casuarina glauca actinorhizal tree establishes root-nodule symbiosis N2-fixing Frankia bacteria. plant commonly found saline zones widely used remediate marginal soils prevent desertification. nature ability survive extreme environments extent Frankia contribution stress tolerance remain unknown. Thus, evaluated ability C. glauca cope salt stress influence symbiosis trait. end, analysed impact salt plant growth, mineral contents, water relations, photosynthetic-related parameters non-structural sugars nodulated vs. non-nodulated plants. Although effects photosynthesis stomatal conductance started become measurable presence 200 mM NaCl, photochemical (e.g., photosynthetic electron flow) biochemical (e.g., activity photosynthetic enzymes) parameters strongly impaired NaCl levels reached 600 mM. results indicate maintenance high tissue hydration salt stress, probably associated enhanced osmotic potential. Furthermore, maintenance photosynthetic assimilation potential (A(max)), together increase quantum yield down-regulated energy dissipation PSII (Y(NPQ)), suggested down-regulation photosynthesis instead photo-damaging effects. comparison impact increasing NaCl levels activities photosynthetic (RubisCO ribulose-5 phosphate kinase) respiratory (pyruvate kinase NADH-dependent malate dehydrogenase) enzymes vs. photosynthetic electron flow fluorescence parameters, revealed biochemical impairments limiting photochemical damage. Altogether, results indicate that, controlled conditions, C. glauca tolerates high NaCl levels capacity linked photosynthetic adjustments.
