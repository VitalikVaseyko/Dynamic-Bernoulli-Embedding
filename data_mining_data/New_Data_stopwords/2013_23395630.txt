 Neuroblastoma (NB) characterized pleomorphic molecular characteristics, may influence cellular metabolism well efficacy glycolytic inhibitors suppressing NB cell growth. studied metabolic profile four NB cell lines without MYCN amplification found unanimous metabolic characteristics. two NB cell lines MYCN amplification exhibited significantly higher HIF-1alpha expression level ATP content compared two cell lines without MYCN amplification. MYCN amplification associated significantly greater inhibition cellular proliferation apoptosis treatment glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). analysis showed 2DG decreased PDK1 ATP content. [corrected]. addition, 2DG decreased hexokinase II expression SK-N-DZ cells increased HIF-1alpha, Noxa, PUMA expression SK-N-AS cells. Pretreating SK-N-DZ cells 2DG cisplatin 24 h, followed cisplatin 2DG another 24 h, resulted significantly greater suppression cellular proliferation compared treatment 2DG cisplatin 48 h alone. Effective suppression SK-N-AS proliferation occurred cells pretreated cisplatin. Pretreatment SK-N-DZ, SK-N-AS, 2DG followed BH3-only mimetic ABT737 also resulted significantly greater suppression cellular proliferation compared treatment ABT737 2DG alone. low dose 2DG (2mM) effective high dose (20mM) SK-N-DZ cells. conclusion, glycolytic inhibitor 2DG complemented cisplatin- ABT737-induced suppression growth NB cells, sensitive glycolytic inhibition.
