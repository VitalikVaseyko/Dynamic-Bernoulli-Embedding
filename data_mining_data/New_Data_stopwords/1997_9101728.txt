 Phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase overexpressed filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. Moderate overexpression glycolytic enzymes A. niger N400 (3-5-fold wild-type level), either individually simultaneously, increase citric acid production fungus significantly. Thus, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase seem contribute major way flux control metabolism involved conversion glucose citric acid. Overexpression phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase influence activities enzymes pathway, change intermediary metabolite levels. However, strains overexpressing phosphofructokinase, level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, positive allosteric effector phosphofructokinase, reduced almost 2-fold compared wild-type strain. Measurements purified phosphofructokinase, using substrate, product effector concentrations found intracellularly, showed reduction fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level could decrease specific activity phosphofructokinase cell significantly. Thus, fungus seems adapt overexpression phosphofructokinase decreasing specific activity enzyme reduction level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.
