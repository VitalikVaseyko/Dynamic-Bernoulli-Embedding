 histidine-phosphorylatable phosphocarrier protein (HPr) essential component sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system (PTS) many bacteria. Recent interactome findings suggested HPr interacts several carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, whether HPr plays regulatory role unclear. Here, provide evidence HPr interacts large number proteins Escherichia coli demonstrate HPr-dependent allosteric regulation activities pyruvate kinase (PykF, PykA), phosphofructokinase (PfkB, PfkA), glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB), adenylate kinase (Adk). HPr either phosphorylated histidyl residue (HPr-P) non-phosphorylated (HPr). PykF activated non-phosphorylated HPr, decreases PykF Khalf phosphoenolpyruvate 10-fold (from 3.5 0.36 mm), thus influencing glycolysis. PfkB activation HPr, HPr-P, resulted decrease Khalf fructose-6-P, likely influences gluconeogenesis glycolysis. Moreover, NagB activation HPr important utilization amino sugars, allosteric inhibition Adk activity HPr-P, HPr, allows HPr regulate cellular energy charge coordinately glycolysis. observations suggest HPr serves directly interacting global regulator carbon energy metabolism probably physiological processes enteric bacteria.
