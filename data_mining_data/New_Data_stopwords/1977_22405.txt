 studied influence chlorpromazine release enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, EC 3.2.1.31; lactate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.27; pyruvate kinase, 2.7.1.40) proteins using human granulocytes isolated maintained 37 degrees C. Chlorpromazine biphasic effect enzyme release inhibition glycolytic pathway could demonstrated high concentrations chlorpromazine, one hour's incubation. NAD+/NADH ratio significantly perturbed concentrations. effect time dependent. action 4 phenothiazine derivatives made possible establish relationship physico-chemical properties protein release. results compared studies using biological materials.
