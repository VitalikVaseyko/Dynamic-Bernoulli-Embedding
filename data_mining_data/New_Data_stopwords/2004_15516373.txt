 Numerous human vivo studies skeletal muscle gene expression investigated effects given interventions. founded assumption presampling regarded representative control postintervention sampling. However, many genes responsive metabolic status, varies day, observed differences gene expression pre- post-sample may therefore result daily variations rather intervention. Furthermore, sampling cause local stress response, may also influence expression genes later samples localized area. test this, performed short-term human endurance exercise study muscle biopsies obtained healthy untrained individuals (n=14) hours exercise measure expression mRNA previously reported exercise-related genes (e.g., PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), MyoD, p21, (heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), citrate synthase (CS), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)). test changes unrelated exercise, one half subjects exercise. suspected, several presumed exercise-induced genes induced even without exercise. data demonstrate presampling always representative control postintervention sampling, illustrating use presampling cause erroneous interpretations underlying induction signals.
