 M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) key driver glycolysis cancer cells critical 'non-metabolic' functions cancers; however, role PKM2 pancreatic cancer remains unclear. aim current study elucidate role PKM2 pancreatic cancer progression potential PKM2 therapeutic target. study, observed PKM2 highly expressed patients pancreatic cancer correlated survival. Elevated PKM2 expression promoted cell proliferation, migration tumor formation. inhibition cell growth silencing PKM2 caused impairment autophagy process. test potential effects downregulating PKM2 clinical therapy, constructed RGD-modified oncolytic adenovirus containing shPKM2 (O(Ad).R.shPKM2) knock PKM2 pancreatic cancer cells. Cells transduced O(Ad).R.shPKM2 exhibited decreased cell viability, and, PANC-1 xenograft model, intratumoral injection O(Ad).R.shPKM2 resulted reduced tumor growth. Furthermore, O(Ad).R.shPKM2 induced apoptosis impaired autophagy PANC-1 cells. results suggested targeting PKM2 oncolytic adenovirus produced strong antitumor effect, strategy could broaden therapeutic options treating pancreatic cancer.
