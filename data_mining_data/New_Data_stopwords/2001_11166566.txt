 Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyze conversion purine pyrimidine nucleotides deoxynucleotides organisms provide monomeric precursors essential DNA replication repair. RNRs divided three classes basis unique metallo-cofactors. exquisitely controlled free radical chemistry used RNRs, commonality structures subunits nucleotide reduction process occurs, together provide compelling evidence importance chemistry divergent evolution RNRs common progenitor.
