 production ethanol xylose ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain KO11 improved adding various medium supplements (acetate, pyruvate, acetaldehyde) prolonged growth phase increasing cell yield volumetric productivity (approximately twofold). Although added pyruvate acetaldehyde rapidly metabolized, benefit additives continued throughout fermentation. additives increased levels extracellular acetate different mechanisms. Since acetate reversibly converted acetyl coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) acetate kinase phosphotransacetylase, increase cell yield caused three supplements proposed result increase pool acetyl-CoA. similar benefit obtained inactivation acetate kinase (ackA), reducing production acetate (and ATP) sparing acetyl-CoA biosynthetic needs. Inactivation native E. coli alcohol-aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhE), uses acetyl-CoA electron acceptor, beneficial effect growth, consistent minor role enzyme ethanol production. Growth KO11 xylose appears limited partitioning carbon skeletons biosynthesis rather level ATP. Changes acetyl-CoA production consumption provide useful approach modulate carbon partitioning. Together, results demonstrate xylose fermentation ethanol improved KO11 redirecting small amounts pyruvate away fermentation products biosynthesis. Though negligible respect ethanol yield, small changes carbon partitioning reduced time required complete fermentation 9.1% xylose 1% corn steep liquor medium 96 h less 72 h.
