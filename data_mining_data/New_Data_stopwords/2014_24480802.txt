 Metabolic reprogramming one critical features cancer. Tumor cells preferentially utilize glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation presence oxygen, namely 'Warburg Effect'. Recent studies provided new insights Warburg effect, elucidating metabolic-dependent independent mechanisms metabolic enzymes regulated post-translational modifications providing evidence critical role tricks cancer metabolism tumorigenesis. particular interest, summarized latest advances metabolic non-metabolic functions metabolic enzymes via acetylation regulation Warburg effect. addition, potential roles cancer metabolism therapy also briefly discussed.
