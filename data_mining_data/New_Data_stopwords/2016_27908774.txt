 Carbon dioxide (CO2) abundant cheap carbon source partly responsible global warming atmosphere. objective study construct recombinant E. coli strain show enhanced production succinate derived CO2. study, confirmed enhancement utilization analyzing succinate containing one carbon-13 ((13)C) derived (13)CO2. Firstly, carbonic anhydrase gene (SP(-)HCCA) derived Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 over-expressed enhance carbon flux toward bicarbonate ion (HCO3(-)) synthesis E. coli. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene (ppc) over-expressed enhance production oxaloacetate enhancing carbon flux. Compared control strain, percentage succinate containing one (13)C (succinate(119)) total succinate enhanced approximately 2.80-fold amount succinate(119) also increased approximately 4.09-fold SGJS120. Secondly, lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhA) deleted re-direct utilization carbon source glucose enhance succinate production SGJS120. However, ldhA deletion increase CO2 utilization SJGS120. Finally, phosphotransferase system gene (ptsG) pyruvate kinase F gene (pykF) deleted increase amount phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). SGJS126 (pykF deletion strain) showed highest increase, 6.05-fold higher control strain. results, SP(-)HCCA overexpression pykF deletion may useful enhancing CO2 utilization E. coli. Additionally, engineered strains showed potential reduce cost succinate production using industrially cheaper carbon source CO2 converting CO2 valuable chemical.
