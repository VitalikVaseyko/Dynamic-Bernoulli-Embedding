 technological properties milk significant importance dairy industry. Citrate, normal constituent milk, forms one main buffer systems regulate equilibrium Ca(2+) H(+) ions. Higher-than-normal citrate content associated poor coagulation properties milk. identify genes responsible variation citrate content milk dairy cattle, metabolic steps involved citrate fatty acid synthesis pathways ruminant mammary tissue using RNA sequencing studied. Genetic markers could influence milk citrate content Holstein cows used marker-trait association study establish relationship 74 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) 20 candidate genes citrate content 250 Holstein cows. analysis revealed 6 SNP key metabolic pathway genes [isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), soluble (IDH1); pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) beta (PDHB); pyruvate kinase (PKM2); solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier; citrate transporter), member 1 (SLC25A1)] significantly associated increased milk citrate content. amount phenotypic variation explained 6 SNP ranged 10.1 13.7%. Also, genotype-combination analysis revealed highest phenotypic variation explained combining IDH1_23211, PDHB_5562, SLC25A1_4446 genotypes. specific genotype combination explained 21.3% phenotypic variation. largest citrate associated effect 3' untranslated region SLC25A1 gene, responsible transport citrate across mitochondrial inner membrane. study provides approach using RNA sequencing, metabolic pathway analysis, association studies identify genetic variation functional target genes determining complex trait phenotypes.
