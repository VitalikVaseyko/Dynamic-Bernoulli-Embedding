 STUDY QUESTION: human sperm proteins interact zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins, ZPA/2, ZPB/4 ZPC/3? SUMMARY ANSWER: Co-precipitation experiments recombinant human ZP (rhZP) coated beads demonstrated interactions various proteins, including glutathione S-transferase M3 (GSTM) ZPB/4 voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) ZPA/2 ZPC/3. KNOWN ALREADY: Regarding sperm-ZP binding, several target spot/proteins detected several species, characterized. limit studies mixture different ZP glycoproteins used allow identification specific ZP glycoprotein (ZPA/2, ZPC/3 ZPB/4) involved interaction sperm proteins. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: identify human sperm proteins interacting oocyte ZP, combined two approaches: immunoblot human spermatozoa targeted antisperm antibodies (ASAs) infertile men far western blot human sperm proteins overlayd rhZP proteins. MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: used rhZP expressed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells ASA eluted infertile patients undergoing IVF failure. Sperm proteins separated two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis recognized sperm-eluted ASAs infertile patients rhZP identified mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS). proteins validated co-precipitation experiments rhZP functional zona binding tests. MAIN RESULTS ROLE CHANCE: identified proteins glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase 3, enolase 1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase A, triosephosphate isomerase, detoxification enzymes GSTM phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, ion channels VDAC2 structural proteins outer dense fibre 2. Several proteins localized sperm head. However, proteins also described exert functions flagellum. Co-precipitation experiments rhZP-coated beads confirmed direct interaction GSTM ZP4 VDAC2 ZP2 ZP3. LIMITATIONS, REASONS CAUTION: used recombinant ZP place native ZP. Thus, post-translational modifications proteins, glycosylations, different influence function. However, CHO cell-expressed rhZP functional, e.g. bind human spermatozoa induce acrosome reaction. Moreover, identification relevant proteins limited need sufficient amounts proteins preparative 2D-gel subsequently analysed MALDI-TOF MS/MS. WIDER IMPLICATIONS FINDINGS: results bring new insights ability sperm proteins exert several functions depending sub-cellular localization, either head flagellum. multiple roles suggest sperm proteins multifaceted moonlighting proteins.
