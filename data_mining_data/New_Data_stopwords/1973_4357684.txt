 Adaptive changes energy metabolism, reflected pyruvate kinase cytochrome oxidase activities, examined vitro differentiation cultivated macrophage. Serum concentrations tissue culture media, directly influence endocytic activity, ambient oxygen tension shown influence pyruvate kinase cytochrome oxidase activities. Cells maintained high serum concentrations (30% newborn calf serum [NBCS]) exhibited 300-400% increase pyruvate kinase activity 40% increase cytochrome oxidase activity, whereas cells maintained low serum concentrations (2% NBCS) exhibited lesser increase (65%) pyruvate kinase activity change cytochrome oxidase activity. Anaerobiosis resulted additional alterations pyruvate kinase cytochrome oxidase activities. Cells maintained 48-72 h anaerobic conditions exhibited 500-600% increase pyruvate kinase activity 40% decrease cytochrome oxidase activity. Increased pyruvate kinase activity dependent continued protein synthesis. Enzyme increases occurred anaerobically cultured cells despite overall reduction cell protein synthesis. suggested adaptive changes pyruvate kinase cytochrome oxidase activity resulting alterations either serum concentration ambient oxygen tension regulated two independent mechanisms. One mechanism aimed providing energy endocytic activity compensating impaired oxidative metabolism anaerobiosis.
