 Substantially high rate glycolysis, known Warburg effect, well-known feature cancers, emerging evidence suggests supports cancerous proliferation/tumor growth. Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), glycolytic enzyme, commonly up-regulated several cancers, recent reports show involvement Warburg effect. Here, comprehensive analysis shows PGAM acetylated lysines 100/106/113/138 central region, member Sirtuin family (class III deacetylase), SIRT2, responsible deacetylation. Over-expression SIRT2 mutations acetylatable lysines PGAM attenuates cancer cell proliferation concomitant decrease PGAM activity. also report acetyltransferase PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) interacts PGAM acetylates C-terminus, central region. prior evidence suggests SIRT2 functions tumor suppressor, results would provide support mechanistic basis activity.
