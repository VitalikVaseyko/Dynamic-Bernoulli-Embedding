 Glycolysis critical cancer stem cell reprogramming; however, underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, show pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) enriched breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), whereas depletion PDK1 remarkably diminishes ALDH(+) subpopulations, decreases stemness-related transcriptional factor expression, inhibits sphere-formation ability tumor growth. Conversely, high levels PDK1 enhance BCSC properties correlated poor overall survival. mouse xenograft tumor, PDK1 accumulated hypoxic regions activates glycolysis promote stem-like traits. Moreover, screening hypoxia-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) PDK1-positive tissue, find lncRNA H19 responsible glycolysis BCSC maintenance. Furthermore, H19 knockdown decreases PDK1 expression hypoxia, ablation PDK1 counteracts H19-mediated glycolysis self-renewal ability vitro vivo. Accordingly, H19 PDK1 expression exhibits strong correlations primary breast carcinomas. H19 acting competitive endogenous RNA sequesters miRNA let-7 release Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, leading increase PDK1 expression. Lastly, aspirin markedly attenuates glycolysis cancer stem-like characteristics suppressing H19 PDK1. Thus, novel findings demonstrate glycolysis gatekeeper PDK1 critical role BCSC reprogramming provides potential therapeutic strategy breast malignancy.
