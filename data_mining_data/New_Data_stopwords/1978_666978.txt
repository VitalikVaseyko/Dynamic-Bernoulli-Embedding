 deformability three previously described morphological populations erythrocytes splenectomized pyruvate kinase (PK) deficient patients assessed using Nucleopore filtration micropipette techniques. Mean deformability decreased fresh cells patients studied. Selective measurements indicated immature lobulated reticulocytes patient least deformable cells, followed bizarre echinocytes characterized hyperviscous behaviour, thin macrocytic discocytes whose values closest control erythrocytes. conclude poorly deformable reticulocytes patients, initial trapping spleen, unable return circulation inordinate dependence mitochondrial oxydative phosphorylation maintenance sufficient intracellular concentration adenosine triphosphate (ATP); hence rapid selective destruction. Splenectomy therefore may beneficial allowing cells mature slowly circulation patients develop crenation hyperviscosity, two manifestations profound ATP depletion possibly leading destruction liver.
