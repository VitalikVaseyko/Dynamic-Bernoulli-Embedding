 Changes activity 3 enzymes--lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble malate dehydrogenase (sMDH), pyruvate kinase (PK)--in homogenates larval salivary glands Drosophila melanogaster studied induction heat sensitive puffs trinactin. activities 2 enzymes (LDH sMDH) enhanced puff induction, effect abolished presence cycloheximide. Pyruvate kinase activity change puff induction. results indicate relation increase LDH sMDH activity due de novo synthesis induction heat sensitive puffs.
