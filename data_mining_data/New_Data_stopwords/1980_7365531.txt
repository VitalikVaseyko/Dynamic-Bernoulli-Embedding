 Experiments designed investigate whether metabolic responses pregnant females keeping known state gestational hyperinsulinemia. Groups female rats fed 32% protein diet killed days 13, 15, 17, 19 21 pregnancy, either daytime night-time. Liver pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities increased nonpregnant values day 13 onward agreement expected result gestational hyperinsulinemia. Liver malate dehydrogenase (NADP) activity increased lesser extent later. Pyruvate lactate accumulated maternal liver day 13 onward. fact accumulation could related increase food intake time correlated day 21 litter size taken indication probable contribution conceptus maternal pyruvate lactate accumulation late pregnancy. Liver alanine amino-transferase activity decreased pregnancy progressed. change serine dehydratase activity found. Cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase activity remained unchanged. Mitochondrial activity increased pregnancy progressed.
