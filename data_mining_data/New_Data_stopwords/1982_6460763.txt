 role AMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6) reaction stimulation regulatory enzymes glycolysis investigated using permeabilized yeast cells. 1) addition polyamine activated AMP deaminase situ, resulting subsequent increase ammonium production, stimulate activity 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). 2) Zn2+ inhibited AMP deaminase activity, followed decrease ammonium ion concentration reduced activity phosphofructokinase. 3) Polyamine Zn2+ activate inhibit directly activity phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. 4) simple Michaelis-Menten relationship observed various levels ammonium ion fructose 1,6-biphosphate formed situ, indicating phosphofructokinase activity glycolytic flux dependent upon level ammonium produced action AMP deaminase. 5) increase Pi concentration resulted decreased magnitude activation NH4+ marked stimulation Pi phosphofructokinase, reduced production NH4+ inhibition AMP deaminase, suggesting phosphofructokinase activity may regulated level NH4+ Pi concentration conditions increased Pi levels. AMP deaminase-ammonium system shows regulatory function glycolysis yeast cells presence physiological Pi levels, whereas glycolysis may principally controlled Pi level conditions elevated Pi concentration. Polyamines may play part stimulation glycolysis elevated level ammonium ion conditions increased ATP utilization cell proliferation, participate catabolic processes well anabolic processes stimulation AMP deaminase-ammonium system.
