 Red ginseng (the steamed root Panax ginseng C.A. MEYER, Araliaceae), contains ginsenosides main constituents, frequently used treat tumor, inflammation, diabetes, stress acquired immunodeficiency syndrome Asian countries. ginsenosides, protopanaxadiol compound K reported abolish cytoprotective phenotype human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-transfected human macrophages. Here, investigated anti-cytoprotective effect protopanaxatriol ginsenoside Rh1 Tat-expressing cytoprotective CHME5 cells D3-infected human primary macrophages. Treatment ginsenoside Rh1 presence lipopolysaccharide/cycloheximide (LPS/CHX) potently abolished cytoprotective phenotype Tat-transduced CHME5 cells well D3-infected human primary macrophages. Ginsenoside Rh1 significantly inhibited LPS/CHX-induced Akt phosphorylation, well mammalian target rapamycin Bcl-2-associated death promoter activation cell types. Furthermore, ginsenoside Rh1 inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1 (PDK-1) phosphorylation. However, ginsenoside Rh1 inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase phosphorylation. Ginsenosides Rh1 presence miltefosine (5 microM) additively increased anti-cytoprotective activity HIV-1 Tat-expressing macrophages. basis findings, propose ginsenoside Rh1 could possibly eliminate HIV-1 infected macrophages inhibiting PDK1/Akt pathway.
