 Pyruvate kinase muscle isozymes (PKMs) crucial roles regulating metabolic changes carcinogenesis. switch PKM1 PKM2 isoform thought lead aerobic glycolysis promoting carcinogenesis, considered one cancer signatures. However, recent evidence argued existence PKM isoform switch related metabolic effects cancer progression. compared effects PKM1 PKM2 cell invasiveness metastasis pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PKM1 PKM2 expression affected cell migration invasion abilities PDAC cells, knockdown PKM2 suppressed metastasis xenograft model. comparing established PKM2 mutants regulation cell invasion, found PKM2 may control cell mobility protein kinase phopho-peptide binding abilities. survey PKM2-associated proteins identified PAK2 possible phosphorylation target PDAC. vitro binding kinase assays revealed PKM2 directly phosphorylated PAK2 Ser20, Ser141, Ser192/197. Knockdown PKM2 decreased PAK2 protein half-life increasing ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Moreover, identified PAK2 HSP90 client protein mutation Ser192/197 PAK2 reduced PAK2-HSP90 association. Knockdown PAK2 diminished vitro cell mobility vivo metastatic ability PKM2 overexpressed PDAC cells. PKM2 PAK2 protein expression also positively correlated PDAC tissues. findings indicate PKM2-PAK2 regulation critical developing metastasis PDAC, suggest targeting PKM2/HSP90/PAK2 complex potential therapeutic value deadly disease.
