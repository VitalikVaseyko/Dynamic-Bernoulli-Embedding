 Gene-environment interactions numerous biologically complicated challenging understand role cancer. However, dietary fiber colorectal cancer prevention may represent tractable model system. Fiber fermented colonic bacteria short-chain fatty acids butyrate. One molecular pathway emerged involves butyrate differential effects depending concentration metabolic state cell. Low-moderate concentrations, present near base colonic crypts, readily metabolized mitochondria stimulate cell proliferation via energetics. Higher concentrations, present near lumen, exceed metabolic capacity colonocyte. Unmetabolized butyrate enters nucleus functions histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor epigenetically regulates gene expression inhibit cell proliferation induce apoptosis colonocytes exfoliate lumen. Butyrate may therefore play role normal homeostasis promoting turnover colonic epithelium. cancerous colonocytes undergo Warburg effect, preferred energy source glucose instead butyrate. Consequently, even moderate concentrations butyrate accumulate cancerous colonocytes function HDAC inhibitors inhibit cell proliferation induce apoptosis. findings implicate bacterial metabolite metaboloepigenetic properties tumor suppression.
