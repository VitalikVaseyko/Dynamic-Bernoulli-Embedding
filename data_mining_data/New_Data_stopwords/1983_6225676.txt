 Quinolinic acid 3-mercaptopicolinic acid act inhibitors Fasciola hepatica phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Low concentrations compounds (0.1 mM quinolinate 0.01 mM 3-mercaptopicolinate) resulted noncompetitive inhibition, became mixed inhibition higher concentrations (1.5 0.15 mM, respectively). 3-mercaptopicolinic acid proved much potent effector quinolinic acid. quinolinic acid 3-mercaptopicolinic acid caused significant reduction total amount end product excreted, 3-mercaptopicolinate effective quinolinate. glucose present medium, propionate acetate levels fell significantly inhibitors; however, 3-mercaptopicolinic acid caused effect absence glucose.
