 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) mitochondrial enzyme responsible regulating conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA use tricarboxylic acid cycle. PDH regulated phosphorylation inactivation PDH kinase (PDK) dephosphorylation activation PDH phosphatase (PDP). effect endurance training PDK humans investigated; however, date study examined effect endurance training PDP humans. Therefore, purpose study examine differences PDP activity PDP1 protein content human skeletal muscle across range muscle aerobic capacities. association important higher PDP activity protein content allow increased activation PDH, carbohydrate oxidation. main findings study 1) PDP activity (r(2) = 0.399, P = 0.001) PDP1 protein expression (r(2) = 0.153, P = 0.039) positively correlated citrate synthase (CS) activity marker muscle aerobic capacity; 2) E1alpha (r(2) = 0.310, P = 0.002) PDK2 protein (r(2) = 0.229, P =0.012) positively correlated muscle CS activity; 3) although abundant isoform, PDP1 protein content explained approximately 18% variance PDP activity (r(2) = 0.184, P = 0.033). addition, PDP1 combination E1alpha explained approximately 38% variance PDP activity (r(2) = 0.383, P = 0.005), suggesting may alternative regulatory mechanisms enzyme protein content. data suggest higher muscle aerobic capacity (CS activity) greater capacity carbohydrate oxidation (E1alpha), concert higher potential PDH activation (PDP activity).
