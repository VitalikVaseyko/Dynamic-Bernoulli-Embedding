 Obesity type 2 diabetes associated increased lipogenesis liver. results fat accumulation hepatocytes, condition known hepatic steatosis, form nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), common cause liver dysfunction United States. Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), transcriptional activator glycolytic lipogenic genes, emerged major player development hepatic steatosis mice. However, molecular mechanisms enhancing transcriptional activity remain largely unknown. study, identified histone acetyltransferase (HAT) coactivator p300 serine/threonine kinase salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) key upstream regulators ChREBP activity. cultured mouse hepatocytes, showed glucose-activated p300 acetylated ChREBP Lys672 increased transcriptional activity enhancing recruitment target gene promoters. SIK2 inhibited p300 HAT activity direct phosphorylation Ser89, turn decreased ChREBP-mediated lipogenesis hepatocytes mice overexpressing SIK2. Moreover, liver-specific SIK2 knockdown p300 overexpression resulted hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, phenotypes reversed SIK2/p300 co-overexpression. Finally, mouse models type 2 diabetes obesity, low SIK2 activity associated increased p300 HAT activity, ChREBP hyperacetylation, hepatic steatosis. findings suggest inhibition hepatic p300 activity may beneficial treating hepatic steatosis obesity type 2 diabetes identify SIK2 activators specific p300 inhibitors potential targets pharmaceutical intervention.
