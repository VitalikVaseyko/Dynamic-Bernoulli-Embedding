 Addition uncoupler protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) starved yeast cells starts endogenous alcoholic fermentation lasting 20 min. Hexose 6-phosphates, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, pyruvate accumulate less 2 min addition CCCP almost zero concentration concentrations correspond 1/5-1/10 steady-state concentrations fermentation glucose. CCCP immediately causes decrease intracellular cytosolic pH 6.9 6.4. change activates adenylate cyclase (Purwin, C., Nicolay, K., Scheffers, W.A., Holzer, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8744-8749) leads previously observed transient increase cyclic AMP. shown following enzymes known vitro experiments activated cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation activated CCCP-treated starved yeast cells vivo: glycogen phosphorylase, trehalase (pH 7), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. activation 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase leads accumulation fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, known vitro experiments activate 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase inhibit fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. effects observed intact yeast cells fit idea CCCP-initiated activation adenylate cyclase leads sequence events protein phosphorylation allosteric effects initiates endogenous alcoholic fermentation.
