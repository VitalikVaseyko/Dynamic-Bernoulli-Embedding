 Upon stimulation Th1 cytokines bacterial lipopolysaccharides, resting macrophages shift phenotype toward pro-inflammatory state part innate immune response. LPS-activated macrophages undergo profound metabolic changes adapt new physiological requirements. One key step mediate metabolic adaptation stabilization HIF1alpha, leads increased glycolysis lactate release, well decreased oxygen consumption. HIF1 abundance result induction gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) via phosphorylation. Therefore, speculated pyruvate oxidation PDH decreased pro-inflammatory macrophages. However, answer open question, in-depth analysis metabolic branching point far lacking. work, applied stable isotope-assisted metabolomics techniques demonstrate pyruvate oxidation maintained mature pro-inflammatory macrophages. Glucose-derived pyruvate oxidized via PDH generate citrate mitochondria. Citrate used synthesis antimicrobial metabolite itaconate lipogenesis. increased demand metabolites decreases citrate oxidation tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas increased glutamine uptake serves replenish TCA cycle. Furthermore, found PDH flux maintained unchanged PDK1 abundance, despite presence HIF1. pharmacological intervention, demonstrate PDH flux important node M(LPS) macrophage activation. Therefore, PDH represents metabolic intervention point might become research target translational medicine treat chronic inflammatory diseases.
