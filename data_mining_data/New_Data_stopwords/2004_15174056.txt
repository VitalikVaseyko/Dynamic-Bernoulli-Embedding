 method detecting carbonylated proteins two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) developed using biotinylation avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) affinity staining. method used examine oxidatively modified proteins associated oxidative stress. Carbonyl formation proteins first examined model system subjecting bovine serum albumin (BSA) ribonuclease (RNase A) metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO). Carbonyl group formation found occur multiple sites along small amount polypeptide chain cleavage. vivo studies conducted yeast cell cultures using 5 mM hydrogen peroxide induce oxidative stress. Biotinylation yeast protein accomplished extraction 4 degrees C lysis buffer containing 5 mM biotin-hydrazide. Biotin-hydrazide forms Schiff base carbonyl group oxidized protein subsequently reduced electrophoresis. Proteins separated either 2-DE sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Biotinylated species detected using avidin-FITC affinity staining. Detection sensitivity biotinylated proteins five times higher achieved silver staining. limit detection avidin-FITC staining approached 0.64 pmol protein-associated carbonyls. Twenty carbonylated proteins identified proteome yeast following oxidative stress hydrogen peroxide. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis tryptic peptides used identify peptides extracted gels. Aconitase, heat shock protein SSA1 SSC1, pyruvate decarboxylase isozyme 1, pyruvate kinase 1, enolase 1 2, phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldorase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase among major targets oxidative stress.
