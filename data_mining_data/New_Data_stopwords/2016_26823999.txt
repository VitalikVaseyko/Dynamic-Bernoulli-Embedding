 two human cell lines HepG2 hepatoma HMCL-7304 striated muscle gamma-irradiated doses 0 4 Gy. Abundant gammaH2AX foci observed 4 Gy 4 h culture post-irradiation. Sham-irradiated cells showed gammaH2AX foci therefore signs radiation-induced double-strand DNA breaks. Flow cytometry indicated 41.5% HepG2 cells G2/M rose statistically significantly increasing radiation dose reaching plateau approximately 47%. Cell lysates cell lines subjected metabolomic analysis using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS). total 46 metabolites could identified GCMS HepG2 cell lysates 29 HMCL-7304 lysates, occurred HepG2 cells. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed clear separation sham, 1, 2 4 Gy doses. Orthogonal Projection Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed elevations intracellular lactate, alanine, glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 5-oxoproline, found univariate statistics highly statistically significantly elevated 2 4 Gy compared sham irradiated cells. findings suggested upregulation cytosolic aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), potential shunting glucose aldose reductase polyol pathway, consumption reduced Glutathione (GSH) due gamma-irradiation. HMCL-7304 myotubes, putative Warburg effect also observed 2 Gy, albeit lesser magnitude HepG2 cells. anticipated novel metabolic perturbations following gamma-irradiation cultured cells lead fuller understanding mechanisms tissue damage following ionizing radiation exposure.
