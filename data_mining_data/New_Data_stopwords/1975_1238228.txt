 1. pathogenesis mental retardation phenylketonuria remains obscure. Leucocytes proved value study inborn errors metabolism. lymphocyte suitable model cell study mammalian metabolism, ability divide vitro response various stimuli. 2. examined effects phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, phenyl-lactate phenylacetate human leucocyte resting phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated rabbit lymphocyte. 3. Phenylpyruvate phenyl-lactate reduced acetate incorporation leucocyte lipid 38% 48% respectively. phenyl-lactate reduced acetate incorporation resting stimulated lymphocyte, 20% 34% respectively. 4. Glucose incorporation leucocyte lipid unaffected phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate phenyl-lactate. phenyl-lactate inhibited (46%) production CO2 glucose. 5. Phenylalanine leucine incorporation trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material resting stimulated lymphocytes inhibited phenyl-lactate (10-42%), phenylpyruvate (27-57%) phenylacetate (19-39%). 6. Uridine incorporation resting stimulated cells inhibited phenyl-lactate (22-26%), phenylpyruvate (42-52%) phenylacetate (20%). 7. Thymidine incorporation resting lymphocytes reduced phenyl-lactate, phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate phenylalanine 12-26%. Incorporation stimulated cell inhibited phenylpyruvate phenyl-lactate (90%) phenylacetate (66%). 8. Phenylalanine inhibited lymphocyte pyruvate kinase phenylpyruvate inhibited citrate synthetase. 9. results compared published data relating experimental hyperphenylalaninaemia effects metabolites nervous tissue vitro.
