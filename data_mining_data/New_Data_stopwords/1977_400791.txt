 Yeast strains carrying recessive mutations representing four different loci cause defects pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase isolated partially characterized. Cells carrying mutations unable use glucose carbon source measured turbidimetric growth experiments. Tetrad analysis indicated mutations linked other; one mutations, affecting phosphoglycerate kinase, located chromosome III.
