 BACKGROUND: Lung cancer one main causes cancer death. reliable diagnosis follow-up patients important support successful therapy. diagnostic efficiency new marker Tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (Tumor M2-PK) evaluated. MATERIALS METHODS: report immunohistochemical detection pyruvate kinase M2 tissue sections lung cancer specimens presented. Furthermore Tumor M2-PK quantified EDTA plasma lung cancer patients order monitor disease, especially chemotherapy. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical detection pyruvate kinase M2 tissue sections lung cancer specimens showed selective staining tumor cells, independent histological classification tumor. EDTA plasma lung cancer patients, marker concentrations correlated well tumor load follow-up, showing significantly increasing concentrations progressive tumor stages decreased concentrations tumor remission. Again, effect independent histological tumor type. CONCLUSION: present data indicate Tumor M2-PK EDTA-plasma could valuable tumor marker monitoring lung cancer.
