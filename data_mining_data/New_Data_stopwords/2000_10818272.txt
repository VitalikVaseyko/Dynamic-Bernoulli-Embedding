 Increased activity hepatic glucose phosphorylation observed perch feeding previously fasted fish. pellet diet containing 14% carbohydrate given, increased activity low affinity towards glucose (S0.5 = 19.5 mM) resembled mammalian glucokinase (Hexokinase IV D) glucokinase-like activity previously observed salmon liver. addition, increased activity hexokinase high affinity towards glucose (Km = 0.50 mM) observed pellet diet. increase activity hexokinase alone observed fish fed filet cod containing less 0.2% carbohydrate. Perch high hepatic glucokinase-like activity eating pellet diet high activities pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, indicating high capacity glycolysis carbohydrate utilization. Simultaneously, activity glycogen phosphorylase strongly reduced activity fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase significantly changed. observations made perch captured spawning season brought laboratory. Assays glucose phosphorylation livers perch eating natural diet (insects) lake showed glucokinase-like activity.
