 cell energy fraction powered maintenance expression genes encoding pro-phage elements, pta-ack cluster, early sporulation, sugar ABC transporter periplasmic proteins, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-disphosphatase acetogen Clostridium sp. MT871 re-directed power synthetic operon encoding isobutanol biosynthesis expense genes achieved via elimination. Genome tailoring decreased cell duplication time 7.0 +/- 0.1 min (p < 0.05) compared parental strain, intact genome cell duplication time 68 +/- 1 min (p < 0.05). Clostridium sp. MT871 tailored genome UVC-mutated withstand 6.1 % isobutanol fermentation broth prevent product inhibition engineered commercial biocatalyst producing 5 % (674.5 mM) isobutanol two-step continuous fermentation CO2/H2 gas blend. Biocatalyst Clostridium sp. MT871RG- 11IBR6 engineered express six copies synthetic operon comprising optimized synthetic format dehydrogenase, pyruvate formate lyase, acetolactate synthase, acetohydroxyacid reductoisomerase, 2,3-dihydroxy-isovalerate dehydratase, branched-chain alpha-ketoacid decarboxylase gene, aldehyde dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, regaining cell duplication time 68 +/- 1 min (p < 0.05) parental strain. first report isobutanol production engineered acetogen biocatalyst suitable commercial manufacturing chemical/fuel using continuous fermentation CO2/H2 blend thus contributing reversal global warming.
