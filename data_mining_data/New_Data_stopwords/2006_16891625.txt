 Pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction central pathogenesis type 2 diabetes may involve secretory failure glucolipotoxity. relative importance transcription factors carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), sterol-responsive element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), upstream stimulatory factor (USF) induction lipogenic genes glucose remains unclear. confocal imaging, show ChREBP translocates nucleus MIN6 beta cells response glucose. ChREBP SREBP-1c required induction fatty acid synthase (FAS) promoter glucose, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed glucose induced binding ChREBP SREBP-1c FAS promoter without affecting USF2 binding. contrast, ChIP assay revealed high glucose prompted direct binding ChREBP, SREBP-1c USF2, liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promoter. event indispensable induction L-PK gene glucose, demonstrated RNA silencing, single-cell promoter analysis, quantitative real-time PCR. conclude ChREBP critical regulator lipogenic genes beta cell may play role development glucolipotoxicity beta cell failure alteration gene expression type 2 diabetes.
