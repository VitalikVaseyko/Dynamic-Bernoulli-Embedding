 aim study assess effort capacity rats subjected combined effects high-protein diet (protein 49%; carbohydrate 30%) endurance training. measure animal fitness time running exhaustion treadmill. changes carbohydrate content including hepatic muscular glycogen, peripheral blood glucose concentration activity glycolytic enzymes red slow oxidative (SO) white fast glycolytic (FG) fibres gastrocnemius muscle analysed. Samples skeletal muscles, liver blood taken one month high-protein diet and/or physical exercise. high protein level diet caused change effort capacity rats decreased capability carbohydrate accumulation skeletal muscles. observed disturbances post-exercise activity hexokinase pyruvate kinase (in both) types fibres) phosphoglycomutase (specially FG fibres) suggest protein enriched died limits extent glycolysis processes. Despite effort capacity animals kept level case standard diet. results suggest metabolic adaptations developed allow continue exercise.
