 PURPOSE: Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) effective therapies leukemia, fail fully eliminate leukemic cells achieve durable remissions many patients advanced BCR-ABL(+) leukemias acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). large-scale synthetic lethal RNAi screen, identified pyruvate dehydrogenase, limiting enzyme pyruvate entry mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, critical survival chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells upon BCR-ABL inhibition. Here, examined role mitochondrial metabolism survival Ph(+) leukemia AML upon TK inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ph(+) cancer cell lines, AML cell lines, leukemia xenografts, cord blood, patient samples examined. RESULTS: showed mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor oligomycin-A greatly sensitized leukemia cells TKI vitro. Surprisingly, oligomycin-A sensitized leukemia cells BCR-ABL inhibition concentrations 100- 1,000-fold required inhibition respiration. Oligomycin-A treatment rapidly led mitochondrial membrane depolarization reduced ATP levels, promoted superoxide production leukemia cell apoptosis combined TKI. Importantly, oligomycin-A enhanced elimination BCR-ABL(+) leukemia cells TKI mouse model primary blast crisis CML samples. Moreover, oligomycin-A also greatly potentiated elimination FLT3-dependent AML cells combined FLT3 TKI, vitro vivo. CONCLUSIONS: TKI therapy leukemia cells creates novel metabolic state highly sensitive particular mitochondrial perturbations. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism adjuvant therapy could therefore improve therapeutic responses TKI patients BCR-ABL(+) FLT3(ITD) leukemias.
