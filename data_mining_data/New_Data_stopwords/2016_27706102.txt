 better understand energetic status proliferating cells, measured intracellular pH (pHi) concentrations key metabolites, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) normal cancer cells, extracted fresh human colon tissues. Cells sorted elutriation segregated different phases cell cycle (G0/G1/S/G2/M) order study redox (NAD, NADP) bioenergetic (ATP, pHi) status. results show average ATP concentration cell cycle higher pHi globally acidic normal proliferating cells. NAD+/NADH NADP+/NADPH redox ratios are, respectively, five times ten times higher cancer cells compared normal cell population. energetic differences normal cancer cells may explain well-described mechanisms behind Warburg effect. Oscillations ATP concentration, pHi, NAD+/NADH, NADP+/NADPH ratios one cell cycle reported hypothesis addressed. also investigated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) human mice normal cancer cell lines. drastic decrease MMP reported cancer cell lines compared normal counterparts. Altogether, results strongly support high throughput aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, observed cancer cells.
