 Incubation rabbit skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) methyl methanethiosulphonate resulted time- inhibitor concentration-dependent loss enzyme activity. Substrates products catalytic reaction prevented loss activity caused methanethiolation. effectiveness protecting agents placed order ADP greater ATP greater Mg2+ greater phosphoenolpyruvate greater pyruvate. essential catalytic cation, K+, effect methanethiolation reaction. [Me-3H]Methanethiosulphonate modified available cysteine thiol groups correlated incorporation four SC3H3 groups per protomer. Four radioactive peptides obtained tryptic peptide mapping. methanethiolation carried presence Mg2+ alone Mg2+ ATP together, three SC3H3 groups incorporated subunit. MgATP protected methanethiolated pyruvate kinase reacted iodo[2-3H]acetic acid 1.37 +/- 0.2 groups per protomer carboxymethylated. 70% radioactivity located single peptide tryptic peptide mapping. peptide isolated contained segment carboxymethyl cysteine (Glx, Asx, Ser) Arg. Collectively data indicate although thiol groups equally accessible methyl methanethiosulphonate, single thiol group participates catalytic event. additional role maintenance structure thiol group also shown studied reduction thermal denaturation enzyme.
