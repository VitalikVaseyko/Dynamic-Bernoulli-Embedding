 PDK1 activates AKT suggesting PDK1 inhibition might suppress tumor development. However, PDK1 investigated intensively oncology target, selective inhibitors suitable vivo studies remained elusive. study present results vivo PDK1 inhibition universally applicable RNAi approach functional drug target validation oncogenic pathway contexts. approach, relies doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression Rosa26 locus, ideal functional studies genes like PDK1 constitutive mouse models lead strong developmental phenotypes embryonic lethality. achieved 90% PDK1 knockdown vivo, level sufficient impact physiological functions resulting hyperinsulinemia hyperglycemia. phenotype reversible PDK1 reexpression. Unexpectedly, long-term PDK1 knockdown revealed lack potent antitumor efficacy 3 different mouse models PTEN-deficient cancer. Thus, despite efficient PDK1 knockdown, inhibition PI3K pathway marginal suggesting PDK1 rate limiting factor. Ex vivo analysis pharmacological inhibitors revealed AKT mTOR inhibitors undergoing clinical development effective PDK1 inhibitors blocking activated PI3K pathway signaling. Taken together findings weaken widely held expectation PDK1 represents appealing oncology target.
