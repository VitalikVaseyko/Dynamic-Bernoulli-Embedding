 Pyruvate kinase (PK) purified red blood cells two sisters suffered severe chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia since infancy, one patient haemolytic anaemia pregnancy. two sisters showed remarkable clinical improvement following splenectomy. enzyme red cells found exhibit low activity (about 25% normal) crude haemolysates, low affinity substrate, phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP), high sensitivity fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) activation. PK differs previously reported variants provisionally designated PK 'Torre Annunziata'. enzyme patient near-normal activity crude haemolysates, slight changes kinetics respect substrate, PEP, respect effects FDP, ATP pH, markedly reduced thermostability. PK also differs previously reported variants provisionally designated PK 'Torre del Greco'. course study improved method purification PK using Cibacron blue sepharose developed.
