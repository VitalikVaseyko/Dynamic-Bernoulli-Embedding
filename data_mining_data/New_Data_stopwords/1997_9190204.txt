 identify element(s) nucleolar proteins determine nucleolus-specific topogenesis, used different kinds cDNA constructs encoding various chimeric combinations mutants constitutive nucleolar protein NO38 (B23): 1) amino terminally placed short "myc tag"; 2) two different carboxyl terminally attached large alpha-helical coiled coil structures, lamin rod domain rod domain vimentin; 3) sequence-related nucleoplasmic histone-binding protein nucleo-plasmin; 4) soluble cytoplasmic protein pyruvate kinase. avoid problem formation complexes endogenous wild-type (wt) molecules "piggyback" localization, special care taken secure mutants chimeras used oligomerize typical protein NO38 (B23). Using microinjection transfection cultured cells, found segment comprising amino-terminal 123 amino acids (aa) alone sufficient effect nucleolar accumulation construct molecules, including chimeras entire rod domains lamin vimentin. However, amino-terminal 109 aa deleted, molecules still associated nucleolus. results deletion experiments domain swaps nucleoplasmin point topogenic importance two independent molecular regions located amino- carboxyl-terminal end. definition dominant elements determining nucleolar localization protein NO38 (B23) well diverse nonnucleolar proteins help identify local binding partner(s) functions, construction probes examining proteins sequence elements within nucleolar microenvironment, generation cells altered nuclear architecture.
