 Isoelectric points normal human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) PK variants abnormal electrophoretic patterns, obtained means isoelectric focussing. obtained isoelectric points normal, PK Nagasaki, PK Tokyo II, PK Ube, case T.S. 7.36, 7.38, 7.05, 6.90, 7.04, respectively, 6 degrees C. PKs collected isoelectric focussing shown L-type PK erythrocyte PK (by means thin-layer-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). PKs fast migration isoelectric points shifted acidic side compared normal subjects. PK slow migration isoelectric point shifted alkaline side, demonstrating isoelectric points obtained isoelectric focussing consistent electrophoretic patterns crude hemolysates. Isoelectric focussing also revealed existence PK variants abnormal electric net charge, well thin-layer-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
