 glycolytic pathway Saccharomyces cerevisiae activated fermentable sugars several steps. Mutants deletions genes coding enzymes upper part glycolysis used characterize triggering mechanisms. Synthesis fructose-2,6-bisphophate catalysed two 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase isoenzymes, one activated fermentable sugars synthesis second enzyme induced (Kretschmer Fraenkel, 1991). Increase level fructose-2,6-bisphosphate demonstrated depend internal metabolite upstream phosphoglucose isomerase reaction. signalling process correlates distinct temporal changes concentration glucose-6-phosphate absolute level, indicating adaptational mechanism. independent uptake phosphorylation systems used different sugars. Interestingly, increase, although delayed, could also observed strains lacking rapid cAMP increase sugar addition thought responsible activating process. Synthesis glucose-6-P fructose-6-P needed complete induction pyruvate kinase inactivation fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. hand, induction pyruvate decarboxylase depends mainly signal lower part glycolysis.
