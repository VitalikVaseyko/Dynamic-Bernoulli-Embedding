 radiosynthesis [(18)F]fluoropyruvate investigated using numerous precursors synthesized ethyl 2,2-diethoxy-3-hydroxypropanoate (5) containing different leaving groups: mesylate, tosylate, triflate, nonaflate. precursors evaluated [(18)F]fluoride incorporation triflate superior. subsequent hydrolysis step investigated, acidic hydrolysis optimized. establishing suitable purification formulation methods, [(18)F]fluoropyruvate could isolated ca. 50% d.c. yield. [(18)F]fluoropyruvate evaluated vitro uptake tumor cells using adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) unfortunately showed uptake approximately 0.1% applied dose per 100,000 cells 30 min. Initial pharmacokinetic properties assessed vivo using nude mice showed high degree bone uptake defluorination, limit potential imaging agent metabolic processes.
