 DNA-damaging agent N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) causes cardiomyocyte death result energy loss excessive activation poly-(ADP) ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) resulting depletion substrates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) ATP. Previously showed chemotherapeutic agent vincristine (VCR) cardioprotective. tested hypothesis VCR inhibits MNNG-induced PARP activation. Adult mouse cardiomyocytes incubated 100 micromol/L MNNG without concurrent VCR (20 micromol/L) 2 4 hours. Cardiomyocyte survival measured using trypan blue exclusion assay. Western blots used measure signaling responses. MNNG-induced cardiomyocyte damage time- concentration-dependent. MNNG activated PARP-1 depleted NAD ATP. VCR completely protected cardiomyocytes MNNG-induced cell damage maintained intracellular levels NAD ATP. VCR increased phosphorylation prosurvival signals Akt, GSK-3beta, Erk1/2, p70S6 kinase. VCR delayed PARP activation evidenced Western blot immunofluorescence staining poly (ADP)-ribose, without directly inhibiting PARP-1 itself. Known PARP-1 inhibitors also protected cardiomyocytes MNNG-induced death. Repletion ATP, NAD, pyruvate, glutamine effects similar PARP-1 inhibitors. conclude VCR protects cardiomyocytes MNNG toxicity regulating PARP-1 activation, intracellular energy metabolism, prosurvival signaling.
