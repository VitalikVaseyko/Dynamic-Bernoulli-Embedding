 Pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate-2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) studied human thyroid carcinomas (n = 9), follicular adenomas (n = 32), normal thyroid tissue (n = 12). specific activity carcinomas (mean 0.94 +/- 0.44) significantly increased (P less 0.0001) comparison pyruvate kinase normal tissue (mean, 0.14 +/- 0.05). Specific activities follicular adenomas rather heterogeneous. tumors divided three groups increasing proliferative activity judged histopathologic criteria, highest specific activities pyruvate kinase found group highest proliferative activity. hand, specific enzyme activities least active tissues (colloid-containing follicular adenomas) comparable normal. isoenzyme composition normal thyroid tissue characterized presence K4, K3M, K2M2 types pyruvate kinase. carcinomas, mainly K4 K3M found. Undifferentiated tumors express K4 type compared follicular papillary carcinomas. Follicular adenomas high specific activity show electrophoretic pattern found follicular carcinomas. Pyruvate kinase malignant tumors inhibited amino acid L-alanine enzyme normal thyroid tissue consequence presence K subunits malignant tissues. K4 type normal thyroid tissue kinetically different K4 type carcinomas.
