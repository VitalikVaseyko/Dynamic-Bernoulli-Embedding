 GATA CACC elements commonly codistributed within regulatory domains variety erythroid genes. Using Drosophila S2 cells, actions GATA1, Sp1, erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) elements within model erythroid promoters assessed. promoter studied (erythroid pyruvate kinase, glycophorin B, murine betamaj globin-derived construct, GCT) Sp1 EKLF activated transcription despite differences CACC element sequence, orientation, positioning. However, GATA1 acted apparent cooperativity Sp1 pyruvate kinase promoter; EKLF betamaj globin-derived GCT promoter; either Sp1 EKLF glycophorin B promoter. Thus, GATA1 may functionally interact Kruppel-like factors depending promoter context; GCT promoter, transcriptional activation GATA1 EKLF > = 10-fold higher levels attributable additive effects. possibility interactions activators may direct supported specific binding baculoviral-expressed EKLF GATA1. report underlines likelihood discrete roles exist Sp1 EKLF erythroid gene activation, supports mechanism direct cooperativity EKLF GATA1 coregulators.
