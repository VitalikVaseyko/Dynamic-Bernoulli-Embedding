 intestine, follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) Peyer's patches (PP) performs Ag sampling first step developing immune responses. Depending species, epithelium contains 10-50% cells, act regulated gates epithelial barriers used opportunistically pathogens invade host. However, mechanisms involved differentiation uptake processes cells known, part limited number intestinal mucosa hampered molecular biochemical studies. work provide evidence PP lymphocytes modulate gene expression PP vivo vitro model FAE. Transgenic mice carrying reporter gene control modified L-pyruvate kinase promoter (SVPK) exhibit strong transgene expression PP FAE, adjacent villous cells. used mouse intestinal epithelial cell line m-IC(cl2) transfected SVPK promoter fused beta-galactosidase investigate direct effect PP lymphocytes SVPK promoter activity. beta-Galactosidase expression 4.4-fold higher transfected m-IC(cl2) cells cultured PP lymphocytes. Conversely, green fluorescent protein expression 1.8-fold lower stably transfected differentiated intestinal Caco-2(cl1) cells sucrase isomaltase promoter fused green fluorescent protein cDNA cultured PP lymphocytes, indicating vivo FAE down-regulation sucrase isomaltase promoter transcriptionally regulated.
