 Elevated aerobic glycolysis cancer cells (Warburg effect) observed many tumor types including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), often detected clinically using FDG-PET. However, role glycolysis supporting growth NPC cells therapeutic implications still remain investigated. present study, showed LDH inhibitor oxamate significantly suppressed NPC cell proliferation vitro tumor growth vivo, yet exhibited minimum toxicity normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells vitro well tolerated mice. Moreover, oxamate exhibited cytotoxic effect NPC cells hypoxia. Mechanistic study showed oxamate significantly inhibited LDH activity, leading substantial decrease glucose uptake lactate production. Combination oxamate mitochondrial respiratory complex inhibitor resulted significant depletion cellular ATP synergistic killing cancer cells. results suggest inhibition glycolysis oxamate effective therapeutic strategy treatment NPC combination compound mitochondrial-targeted agents may improve therapeutic activity.
