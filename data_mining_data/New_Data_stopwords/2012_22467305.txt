 Recent data shown cardioprotection result import specific proteins mitochondria process involves heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) blocked geldanamycin (GD), HSP90 inhibitor. test hypothesis alteration mitochondrial import widespread feature cardioprotection, study, used broad-based proteomics approach investigate changes mitochondrial proteome following cardioprotection induced inhibition glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3. Mitochondria isolated control hearts, hearts perfused GSK inhibitor SB 216763 (SB) 15 min isolation mitochondria. Mitochondrial extracts control SB-perfused hearts labeled isotope tags relative absolute quantification (iTRAQ), differences mitochondrial protein levels determined mass spectrometry. test role HSP90-mediated protein import, hearts perfused presence absence GD 15 min perfusion SB followed mitochondrial isolation iTRAQ labeling. confirmed treatment GD blocked protection afforded SB treatment protocol 20 min ischemia 40 min reperfusion. found 16 proteins showed apparent increase mitochondrial fraction following SB treatment. GD treatment significantly blocked SB-mediated increase mitochondrial association five proteins, included annexin A6, vinculin, pyruvate kinase. also found SB treatment resulted decrease mitochondrial content eight proteins, two established mitochondrial proteins. confirm role mitochondrial import versus change protein synthesis and/or degradation, measured changes proteins whole cell extracts. Taken together, data show SB leads remodeling mitochondrial proteome partially GD sensitive.
