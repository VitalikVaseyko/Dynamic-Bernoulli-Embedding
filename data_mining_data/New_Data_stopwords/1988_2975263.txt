 activities enzymes glycolytic route, pentose phosphate pathway NADPH-linked enzymes measured kidneys genetically obese (ob/ob) mice lean litter mates. renal content glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) also measured. Increases found hexokinase enolase upward trend pyruvate kinase ob/ob mouse kidney; significant decline malic enzyme also seen. renal content G6P Fru-1,6-P2 increased. renal hypertrophy despite degree hyperglycaemia, was, however, considerably observed experimental diabetes. Comparison renal changes hyperglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic ob/ob mice hyperglycaemic-hypoinsulinaemic diabetic group showed two distinct groupings. Firstly, changes similar two groups included: increases hexokinase, G6P Fru-1,6-P2, decrease malic enzyme. Secondly, opposite changes seen enolase enzymes G6P crossroads, phosphoglucose isomerase phosphoglucomutase. elevated hexokinase G6P ob/ob diabetic groups may involved eventual accumulation basement membrane material glomerulus common feature two conditions.
