 Pyruvate kinase major regulatory enzyme glycolysis. Transcription L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene rat liver induced feeding carbohydrate-rich diet. investigate regulatory DNA sequences required response, primary hepatocytes transfected plasmids containing 5'-flanking sequence rat L-PK gene fused chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Sequences -4300 +12 L-PK gene directed increase CAT activity hepatocytes switched media containing 10 mM lactate 25 mM glucose. Average induction 17-fold (n = 13; S.E. = 2.9). Addition fructose media also induced CAT activity. Carbohydrate regulation L-PK promoter retained 5'-deletions -197, constructs deleted -96 completely unresponsive. 101-base pair fragment -197 -96 L-PK gene confer carbohydrate regulation fused either orientation heterologous thymidine kinase promoter, thus defining carbohydrate response element region. Expression transfected gene regulated insulin glucagon pattern similar seen endogenous L-PK gene, suggesting control L-PK promoter activity responsible carbohydrate-mediated changes L-PK mRNA production.
