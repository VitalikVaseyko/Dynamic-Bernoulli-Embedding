 Metabolism cancer cells pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) centre stage assumed prime significance cancer research recent times. Cancer cell metabolism, characterized enhanced glucose uptake, production lactate anabolism considered ideal target therapeutic interventions. Expression PKM2 switches metabolism favor cancer cells, therefore, present study designed investigate hitherto unknown effect resveratrol, phytoalexin, PKM2 expression resultant implications cancer metabolism. observed resveratrol down-regulated PKM2 expression inhibiting mTOR signaling suppressed cancer metabolism, adjudged decreased glucose uptake, lactate production (aerobic glycolysis) reduced anabolism (macromolecule synthesis) various cancer cell lines. contingent decrease intracellular levels ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), critical intermediate pentose phosphate pathway, accounted reduced anabolism. Consequently, state suppressed cancer metabolism resulted decreased cellular proliferation. Interestingly, shRNA-mediated silencing PKM2 inhibited glucose uptake lactate production, providing evidence critical role PKM2 mediation observed effects resveratrol cancer metabolism. Further, over-expression PKM2 abolished observed effects resveratrol, signifying role PKM2 downregulation critical function resveratrol. study reports novel PKM2-mediated effect resveratrol cancer metabolism provides new dimension therapeutic potential.
