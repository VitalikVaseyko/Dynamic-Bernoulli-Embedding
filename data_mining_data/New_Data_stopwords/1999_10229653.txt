 Pyruvate carboxylase (PC; EC 6.4.1.1), member biotin-dependent enzyme family, catalyses ATP-dependent carboxylation pyruvate oxaloacetate. PC found wide variety prokaryotes eukaryotes. mammals, PC plays crucial role gluconeogenesis lipogenesis, biosynthesis neurotransmitter substances, glucose-induced insulin secretion pancreatic islets. reaction catalysed PC physical properties enzyme studied extensively. Although high-resolution three-dimensional structure yet determined X-ray crystallography, structural studies PC conducted electron microscopy, limited proteolysis, cloning sequencing genes cDNA encoding enzyme. well characterized forms active PC consist four identical subunits arranged tetrahedron-like structure. subunit contains three functional domains: biotin carboxylation domain, transcarboxylation domain biotin carboxyl carrier domain. Different physiological conditions, including diabetes, hyperthyroidism, genetic obesity postnatal development, increase level PC expression transcriptional translational mechanisms, whereas insulin inhibits PC expression. Glucocorticoids, glucagon catecholamines cause increase PC activity rate pyruvate carboxylation short term. Molecular defects PC humans recently associated four point mutations within structural region PC gene, namely Val145-->Ala, Arg451-->Cys, Ala610-->Thr Met743-->Thr.
