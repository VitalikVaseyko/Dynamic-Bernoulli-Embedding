 partial purification protein fraction inhibiting pyruvate kinase isoenzymes described. fraction isolated (NH4)2SO4 step purification procedure pyruvate kinase isoenzymes chicken liver (Eigenbrodt, E. & Schoner, W. (1977) Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 358, 1033-1046) extraction 1N NaOH, acidification pH 3, ethanol precipitation chromatography supernatant DEAE-cellulose. inhibitor fraction purified disc gel electrophoresis using gel gradient 10 25%; procedure separated activating proteins inhibitor fraction. inhibitor fraction inhibited pyruvate kinase isoenzymes chicken sequence decreasing effect: M2 greater L greater M1. inhibition due decrease affinity phosphoenolpyruvate. inhibitor stable heating 5 min 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate 100 degrees C; destroyed pepsin digestion. inhibitor fraction could purified dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. resulted separation 2 inhibitors (Mr = 33,500 +/- 8500 ca. 5000), activator (Mr = 15,100 +/- 5200), unidentified protein (Mr = 27,000).
