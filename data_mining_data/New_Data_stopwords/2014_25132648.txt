 Oxygen-sensing mechanisms evolved maintain cell tissue homeostasis since ability sense respond changes oxygen essential survival. primary site oxygen sensing occurs level carotid body response hypoxia signals increased ventilation without need new protein synthesis. Chronic hypoxia activates cellular sensing mechanisms lead protein synthesis designed alter cellular metabolism cells adapt low oxygen environment without suffering toxicity. master regulator cellular response hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Activation system condition hypobaric hypoxia leads weight loss accompanied increased basal metabolic rate suppression appetite. effects dose dependent, gender genetic specific, results adverse effects exposure extreme. Hypoxic adipose tissue may represent unified cellular mechanism variety metabolic disorders, insulin resistance patients metabolic syndrome.
