 novel series hydrazones synthesized evaluated inhibitors methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pyruvate kinase (PK). PK identified one highly connected 'hub proteins' MRSA. PK shown critical bacterial survival makes potential target development novel antibiotics high degree connectivity implies sensitive mutations thus less able develop resistance. PK unique bacteria thus critical requirement PK inhibitor would inhibit homologous human enzyme(s) therapeutic concentrations. Several MRSA PK inhibitors (including 8d) identified using silico screening combined enzyme assays found selective bacterial enzyme compared four human PK isoforms (M1, M2, R L). However lead compounds show significant inhibitory activity MRSA growth presumably due poor bacterial cell penetration. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies carried 8d led us discover potent compounds enzyme inhibiting activities low nanomolar range found effectively inhibit bacteria growth culture minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) low 1 mug/mL. inhibitors bind two elongated flat clefts found minor interfaces homo-tetrameric enzyme complex observed SAR keeping size electronic constraints binding sites. Access corresponding sites human enzyme blocked.
