 Oval cell proliferation precedes neoplasia many rodent models hepatocellular carcinoma prevention proliferative response reduce risk subsequent carcinoma. study aimed determine whether selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, SC-236, affects (i) oval cell response liver injury mouse model hepatocarcinogenesis (ii) oval cell line. Four-week-old mice fed either normal chow choline deficient, ethionine supplemented (CDE) diet presence absence SC-236. Liver histology oval cell numbers determined 2, 4, 12 52 weeks treatment. Oval cells scored using morphological criteria positive immuno-staining M(2)-isozyme pyruvate kinase (M2PK) A6. immortalized oval cell line (PIL-2) used study vitro effects SC-236 oval cell proliferation, apoptosis Akt phosphorylation. percentage M2PK-positive oval cells COX-2-positive cells reduced 80% 45%, respectively, CDE-fed mice receiving SC-236 compared CDE-fed animals receiving SC-236. M2PK-positive oval cells also COX-2 positive. percentage A6-positive cells affected SC-236 administration CDE-fed mice. Administration SC-236 increased apoptosis evidenced 73% increase number TUNEL-positive cells 2 weeks CDE-fed mice. Primary oval cells PIL-2 cells expressed COX-2. vitro treatment PIL-2 cells SC-236 resulted dose-dependent preferential death A6-negative cells. Administration 25 50 microM Prostaglandin E(2) partially attenuated SC-236 induced cell death 25%. vitro oval cell death associated apoptosis 70% reduction Akt phosphorylation. results suggest SC-236 induced reduction M2PK-positive oval cell numbers may due COX-2 dependent inhibition Akt phosphorylation induction apoptosis.
