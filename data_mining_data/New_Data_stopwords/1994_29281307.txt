 Oxygen consumption rates measured 14 species hydromedusae 5 species bathypelagic coronate scyphomedusae. Analysis individuals species medusae showed familiar pattern decreasing specific oxygen consumption rate increasing wet weight animals. Citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) activities measured 30 species medusae. Octopine dehydrogenase, strombine dehydrogenase, alanopine dehydrogenase detected either hydromedusae scyphomedusae. allometric scaling phenomenon decreasing activity larger individuals observed Krebs cycle enzyme activities. LDH activities, hand, increased increasing wet weight. medusae aerobically poised, higher CS activities LDH activities. However, several meso- bathypelagic medusae, including coronate scyphozoans Periphylla periphylla Nausitho{e2dot} rubra, anaerobically poised, possibly mechanism assist vertical migrations low oxygen concentrations oxygen minimum layer. poor correlation CS activities oxygen consumption rates medusae compared previously investigated animals. account poor correlation, propose hypothesis medusan CS periphery maximum diffusion distance may oxygen-limited function normal vivo rate. pelagic medusae, apparent decline metabolic rate metabolic potential, determined enzymatic activity, increasing depth occurrence, beyond declines caused decrease temperature depth. patterns contrast rapid declines metabolic rates metabolic potentials depth observed pelagic fishes crustaceans. Deep-living medusae metabolic rates magnitude similar bathypelagic fishes crustaceans.
