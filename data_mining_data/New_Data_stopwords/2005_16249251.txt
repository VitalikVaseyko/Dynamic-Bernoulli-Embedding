 Skeletal muscle expresses two catalytic subunits, alpha1 alpha2, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), implicated contraction-stimulated glucose transport fatty acid oxidation. Muscle contraction activates alpha2-containing AMPK complex (AMPKalpha2), activation may occur without activation alpha1-containing AMPK complex (AMPKalpha1), suggesting AMPKalpha2 major isoform responsible contraction-induced metabolic events skeletal muscle. report first time AMPKalpha1, AMPKalpha2, activated contracting skeletal muscle. Rat epitrochlearis muscles isolated incubated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing pyruvate. muscles stimulated contract frequency 1 2 Hz last 2 min incubation, AMPKalpha1 activity increased twofold AMPKalpha2 activity remained unchanged. Muscle stimulation change muscle AMP concentration AMP-to-ATP ratio. AMPK activation associated increased phosphorylation Thr(172) alpha-subunit, primary activation site. Muscle stimulation increased phosphorylation acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), downstream target AMPK, rate 3-O-methyl-d-glucose transport. contrast, increasing frequency (>or=5 Hz) duration (>or=5 min) contraction activated AMPKalpha1 AMPKalpha2 increased AMP concentration AMP/ATP ratio. results suggest 1) AMPKalpha1 predominant isoform activated AMP-independent phosphorylation low-intensity contracting muscle, 2) AMPKalpha2 activated AMP-dependent mechanism high-intensity contracting muscle, 3) activation isoform enhances glucose transport ACC phosphorylation skeletal muscle.
