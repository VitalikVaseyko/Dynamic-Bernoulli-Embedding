 Plant feedstuffs (PF) rich carbohydrates, may interact lipid metabolism. Thus, considering dietary replacement fishery by-products PF, knowledge needed dietary lipid source (LS) carbohydrates affect lipid metabolism metabolic pathways. purpose, 73-d growth trial performed European sea bass juveniles (IBW 74 g) fed four diets differing LS (fish oil (FO) blend vegetable oils (VO)) carbohydrate content (0 % (CH-) 20 % (CH+) gelatinised starch). end trial differences among diets observed growth feed utilisation. Protein efficiency ratio was, however, higher CH+ groups. Muscle liver fatty acid profiles reflected dietary LS. Dietary carbohydrate promoted higher plasma cholesterol phospholipids (PL), whole-body hepatic (mainly 16 : 0) lipids increased muscular hepatic glycogen. Except PL, higher FO groups, major alterations FO VO groups observed plasma metabolites (glucose, TAG, cholesterol, PL), liver muscle glycogen, lipid cholesterol contents. Activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase malic enzyme - lipogenesis-related enzymes - increased carbohydrate intake. Hepatic expression genes involved cholesterol metabolism up-regulated carbohydrate (HMGCR CYP3A27) VO (HMGCR CYP51A1) intake. dietary regulation long-chain PUFA biosynthesis transcriptional level observed. Overall, interactions dietary carbohydrates LS observed. However, important insights direct relation dietary carbohydrate cholesterol biosynthetic pathway European sea bass demonstrated.
