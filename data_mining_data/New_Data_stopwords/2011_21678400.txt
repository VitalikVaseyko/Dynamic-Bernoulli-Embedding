 Many critical factors hypoxia, nutrient deficiency, activation glycolytic pathway/Warburg effect contribute observed low pH tumors compared normal tissue. Studies suggest tumor specific acidic environment exploited development therapeutic strategies cancer. Independent observations show reduction pH mammalian cells undergoing internucleosomal DNA fragmentation apoptosis. such, group extensively demonstrated anticancer mechanisms different plant polyphenols involve mobilization endogenous copper consequent internucleosomal DNA breakage. Copper redox active metal, essential component chromatin sensitive subtle pH changes microenvironment. explored whether, acidic pH promotes growth inhibition, apoptosis, DNA damaging capacity chemopreventive agent resveratrol. results reveal growth inhibition internucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced apoptosis Capan-2 Panc-28 pancreatic cancer cell lines (and normal HPDE cells) resveratrol enhanced lower pH. Using comet assay, demonstrate DNA breakage resveratrol enhanced acidification. Membrane permeable copper specific chelator neocuproine (and iron chelator orthophenanthroline) abrogated growth inhibition apoptosis resveratrol. Western blot results show enhanced activation DNA laddering marker H2.aX resveratrol acidic pH reversed neocuproine orthophenanthroline. findings provide irrevocable proof low pH environment turned tumor weakness assist eradication cancer cells resveratrol.
