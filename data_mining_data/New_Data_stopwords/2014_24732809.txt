 Compared normal cells, cancer cells strongly upregulate glucose uptake glycolysis give rise increased yield intermediate glycolytic metabolites end product pyruvate. Moreover, glycolysis uncoupled mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) cancer cells. Consequently, majority glycolysis-derived pyruvate diverted lactate fermentation kept away mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. metabolic phenotype known Warburg effect. become widely accepted glycolytic intermediates provide essential anabolic support cell proliferation tumor growth, remains largely elusive whether Warburg metabolic phenotype may play role tumor progression. hereby review cause consequence restrained oxidative metabolism, particular context tumor metastasis. Cells change lose extracellular matrix metastatic process. Inadequate/inappropriate matrix attachment generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes specific type cell death, termed anoikis, normal cells. Although anoikis barrier metastasis, cancer cells often acquired elevated threshold anoikis hence heightened metastatic potential. ROS inherent byproducts oxidative metabolism, forced stimulation glucose oxidation cancer cells raises oxidative stress restores cells' sensitivity anoikis. Therefore, limiting pyruvate flux mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, Warburg effect enables cancer cells avoid excess ROS generation mitochondrial respiration thus gain increased anoikis resistance survival advantage metastasis. Consistent notion, pro-metastatic transcription factors HIF Snail attenuate oxidative metabolism, whereas tumor suppressor p53 metastasis suppressor KISS1 promote mitochondrial oxidation. Collectively, findings reveal mitochondrial oxidative metabolism critical suppressor metastasis justify metabolic therapies potential prevention/intervention tumor metastasis.
