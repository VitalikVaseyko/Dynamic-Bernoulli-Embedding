 Banana extensively cultivated plant worldwide, mainly fruit, ancillary product, banana pseudostem, consumed vegetable highly recommended diabetics traditional Indian medicine system. present study aimed elucidating mechanism antihyperglycaemia exerted ethanol extract banana pseudostem (EE) isolated compounds viz., stigmasterol (C1) beta-sitosterol (C2), alloxan-induced diabetic rat model. Diabetic rats administered C1, C2 EE (100 200 mg per kg b. wt.) 4 weeks showed reduced levels fasting blood glucose reversal abnormalities serum/urine protein, urea creatinine diabetic rats compared diabetic control group rats. Diabetic symptoms polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria, urine glucose reduced body weight ameliorated diabetic group rats fed EE, C1 C2 (100 mg per kg b. wt., daily) 28 days. levels insulin Hb also increased, HbA1c level reduced. altered activities hepatic marker enzymes viz., aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) alkaline phosphatase (ALP); glycolytic enzyme (hexokinase); shunt enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase); gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase lactate dehydrogenase) pyruvate kinase significantly reverted normal levels administration EE, C1 C2. addition, increased levels hepatic glycogen glycogen synthase corresponding decrease glycogen phosphorylase activity diabetic rats illustrated antihyperglycaemic potential EE components. histological observations revealed marked regeneration beta-cells drug treated diabetic rats. findings suggest EE might exert antidiabetic potential presence C1 C2, attributable enhanced glycolytic activity, besides increasing hepatic glucose utilization diabetic rats stimulating insulin secretion remnant beta-cells.
