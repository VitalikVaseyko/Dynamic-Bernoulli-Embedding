 Alternative splicing fundamental posttranscriptional mechanism controlling gene expression, splicing defects linked various human disorders. splicing factor FOX-2 part main protein interaction hub network related human inherited ataxias, however, impact remains elucidated. Here, focused reported interaction FOX-2 ataxin-1, disease-causing protein spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. line, evaluated interaction yeast-2-hybrid analyses co-immunoprecipitation experiments mammalian cells. Interestingly, discovered FOX-2 localization splicing activity affected presence nuclear ataxin-1 inclusions. Moreover, observed FOX-2 directly interacts ataxin-2, protein modulating spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 pathogenesis. Finally, provide evidence splicing pre-mRNA ataxin-2 depends FOX-2 activity, since reduction FOX-2 levels led increased skipping exon 18 ataxin-2 transcripts. striking, observed ataxin-1 overexpression effect splicing event well. Thus, results demonstrate FOX-2 involved splicing ataxin-2 transcripts splicing event altered overexpression ataxin-1.
