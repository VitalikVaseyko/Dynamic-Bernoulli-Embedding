 study investigated altered pyruvate metabolism prolonged oral arsenic exposure. Male rats given access deionized drinking water containing 0, 40 85 ppm sodium arsenate (As5+) 3 weeks. Respiration studies mitochondria isolated treated animals indicated decreased state 3 respiration (with ADP) decreased respiratory control ratios (RCR) pyruvate/malate-mediated respiration, succinate-mediated respiration, compared control respiration values. addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity measured, liver intestine, Mg-activation vitro. 3 weeks, effects arsenic highest dose level pronounced basal pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (before activation) well total pyruvate dehydrogenase (after activation). inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase activity Mg-activation suggests arsenic effect mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism which, part, involves inhibition pyruvate decarboxylase. Evidence also presented may indicate arsenic effect kinase and/or phosphatase regulate pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.
