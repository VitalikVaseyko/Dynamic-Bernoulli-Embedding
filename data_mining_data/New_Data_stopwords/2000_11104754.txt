 Mg-ATP infusion vivo reported beneficial organ function survival rate various models shock. Moreover, large variety metabolic effects shown occur several tissues due purinergic receptor activation. present work studied effects exogenous Mg-ATP rat liver cells perifused dihydroxyacetone investigate simultaneously gluconeogenetic glycolytic pathways. found significant effect oxidative phosphorylation characterized decrease oxygen consumption rate cellular ATP-to-ADP ratio associated increase lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. addition, exogenous Mg-ATP induced rapid reversible inhibition gluconeogenesis glycolysis. main effect gluconeogenesis located level fructose cycle, whereas decrease glycolysis due strong inhibition pyruvate kinase. Although pyruvate kinase inhibition induced exogenous Mg-ATP allosteric assessed vitro enzyme extraction, found large decrease apparent maximal velocity kinetics assessed vivo intact perifused hepatocytes. newly described short-term regulation pyruvate kinase occurs intact cell may open new potentials pharmacological regulation pyruvate kinase vivo.
