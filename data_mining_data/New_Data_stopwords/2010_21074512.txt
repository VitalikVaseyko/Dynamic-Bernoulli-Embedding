 Warburg proposed cancer originates irreversible injury mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS), leads increase rate aerobic glycolysis cancers. However, despite several decades research related Warburg effect, little known underlying genetic cause(s) mtOXPHOS impairment cancers. Proteins participate mtOXPHOS encoded mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) well nuclear DNA. review describes mutations mtDNA reduced mtDNA copy number, contribute OXPHOS defects cancer cells. Maternally inherited mtDNA renders susceptibility cancer, mutation nuclear encoded genes causes defects mtOXPHOS system. Mitochondria damage checkpoint (mitocheckpoint) induces epigenomic changes nucleus, reverse injury OXPHOS. However, irreversible injury OXPHOS lead persistent mitochondrial dysfunction inducing genetic instability nuclear genome. Together, propose "mitocheckpoint" led epigenomic genomic changes must play key role reversible irreversible injury OXPHOS described Warburg. epigenetic genetic changes underlie Warburg phenotype, contributes development cancer.
