 co-culture system cerebellar granule cells (glutamatergic neurons) hepatocytes developed. Petri dishes divided halves temporary septum coated poly-L-lysine cerebellar granule cells plated one compartments. Five days later hepatocytes plated compartment 2 days septum removed two cell types shared culture medium period 5 days. period time cultures neurons hepatocytes kept separately co-culture exhibited identical characteristics regard activities pyruvate kinase glucokinase (hepatocytes), aspartate aminotransferase (neurons) well evoked transmitter release (neurons) content cytochrome P-450 (hepatocytes). results show possible maintain neurons hepatocytes co-culture sharing culture medium prolonged period time. system may serve pharmacological model study interactions liver brain cells regard neuroactive drugs.
