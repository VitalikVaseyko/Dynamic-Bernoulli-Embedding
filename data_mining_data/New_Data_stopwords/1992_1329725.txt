 initial effects glucagon glycogen breakdown isolated hepatocytes found independent cell volume and, occurred, cell shrinkage followed rather mediated glycogenolytic effect glucagon. Similar conclusions could drawn effect glucagon glycolysis/gluconeogenesis antagonistic effect insulin glucagon action.
