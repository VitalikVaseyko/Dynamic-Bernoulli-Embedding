 Recent evidence suggests potential pro-diabetic effect selenite treatment type 2 diabetics; however, underlying mechanisms remain elusive. investigated effects underlying mechanisms selenite treatment nongenetic mouse model type 2 diabetes. High-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice orally gavaged selenite 0.5 2.0mg/kg body weight/day vehicle 4 weeks. High-dose selenite treatment significantly elevated fasting plasma insulin levels insulin resistance index, parallel impaired glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance pyruvate tolerance. High-dose selenite treatment also attenuated hepatic IRS1/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pyruvate kinase gene expressions, elevated gene expressions phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyl kinase (PEPCK), glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) selenoprotein P (SelP) liver. Furthermore, high-dose selenite treatment caused significant increases MDA contents, protein carbonyl contents, decrease GSH/GSSG ratio liver, concurrent enhanced ASK1/MKK4/JNK signaling. Taken together, findings suggest high-dose selenite treatment exacerbates hepatic insulin resistance mouse model type 2 diabetes, least part oxidative stress-mediated JNK pathway, providing new mechanistic insights pro-diabetic effect selenite type 2 diabetes.
