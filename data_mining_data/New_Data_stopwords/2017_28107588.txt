 wingless/int-1 (Wnt) signal transduction pathway plays central role cell proliferation, survival, differentiation apoptosis. beta-catenin: component Wnt pathway, mutated active form, cell growth signaling hyperactive drives oncogenesis. beta-catenin mutated wide variety tumors, including 10% sporadic colon carcinomas 20% hepatocellular carcinomas, considered promising target therapeutic interventions. Therefore, screened in-house natural product library compounds exhibited synthetic lethality towards beta-catenin mutations isolated nonactin, antibiotic mitochondrial uncoupler, hit compound. Nonactin, well mitochondrial uncouplers, induced apoptosis selectively beta-catenin mutated tumor cells. Significant tumor regression observed beta-catenin mutant HCT 116 xenograft model, beta-catenin wild type A375 xenograft model, response daily administration nonactin vivo. Furthermore, found expression active mutant form beta-catenin induced decrease glycolysis rate. Taken together, results demonstrate tumor cells mutated beta-catenin depend mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation survival. Therefore, undergo apoptosis response mitochondrial dysfunction following addition mitochondrial uncouplers, nonactin. results suggest targeting mitochondria potential chemotherapeutic strategy tumor cells harbor beta-catenin mutations.
