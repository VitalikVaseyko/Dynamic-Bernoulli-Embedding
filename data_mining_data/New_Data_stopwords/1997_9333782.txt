 Hemoglobin, critical protein delivery oxygen mammalian tissues, poorly adapted function. awkward situation remedied presence red cell 5 7 mM 2.3 DPG, binds Hb competitively oxygen reduces oxygen affinity. levels 2.3 DPG red cell regulated important question yet fully answered. best established correlation 2.3 DPG concentration red cells activity enzyme pyruvate kinase. Inverse relationship 2.3 DPG content pyruvate kinase activity result two conditions within erythrocyte. metabolites FBP PEP state quasi equilibrium activity pyruvate kinase much lower activities enzymes pathway. Furthermore, pyruvate kinase operates, vivo PEP concentration well Km concentration. consequence, increase glycolytic rate inhibition pyruvate kinase causes increase PEP concentration. Increases PEP levels lead increases levels 2.3 DPG, hence increase level 2.3 DPG via 2.3 DPG synthase reaction. relationship demonstrated frequent occurrence elevated levels 2.3 DPG pyruvate kinase deficient erythrocytes decreased levels 2.3 DPG PEP observed erythrocytes containing pyruvate kinase abnormally high activity low PEP levels. thus clear control pyruvate kinase activity means control oxygen delivery erythrocyte. remains discovered whether observed variations human PK activity due reversible posttranslational modification whether potential control oxygen delivery via changes pyruvate kinase activity made use normal human adult. availability human full length cDNA PK accelerate understanding structure-function relationships PK deficiency enhance possibility gene therapy seriously affected PK patients.
