 Mutational damage fruK gene coding fructose-1-phosphate kinase leads 2-6-fold (depending strain) decrease FEP synthase activity Escherichia coli. fruK mutants unable utilize lactate well fructose fructose-1-phosphate, acquiring, addition, sensitivity mannose growth medium. Reversions back FruK+ phenotype introduction intact fruK allele resulted restoration FEP synthase activity ability grow lactate.
