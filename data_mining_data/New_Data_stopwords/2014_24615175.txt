 Cancer cells express abnormal metabolism characterized increased glucose consumption owing genetic mutations mitochondrial dysfunction. Previous studies indicate unlike healthy tissues, cancer cells unable effectively use ketone bodies energy. Furthermore, ketones inhibit proliferation viability cultured tumor cells. Warburg effect especially prominent metastatic cells, hypothesized dietary ketone supplementation would inhibit metastatic cancer progression vivo. Proliferation viability measured highly metastatic VM-M3 cells cultured presence absence beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB). Adult male inbred VM mice implanted subcutaneously firefly luciferase-tagged syngeneic VM-M3 cells. Mice fed standard diet supplemented either 1,3-butanediol (BD) ketone ester (KE), metabolized ketone bodies betaHB acetoacetate. Tumor growth monitored vivo bioluminescent imaging. Survival time, tumor growth rate, blood glucose, blood betaHB body weight measured throughout survival study. Ketone supplementation decreased proliferation viability VM-M3 cells grown vitro, even presence high glucose. Dietary ketone supplementation BD KE prolonged survival VM-M3 mice systemic metastatic cancer 51 69%, respectively (p < 0.05). Ketone administration elicited anticancer effects vitro vivo independent glucose levels calorie restriction. use supplemental ketone precursors cancer treatment investigated animal models determine potential future clinical use.
