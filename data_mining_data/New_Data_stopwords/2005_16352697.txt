 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) negative regulator mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC) plays key role intermediary metabolism. OsPDK1 identified gibberellin-up-regulated gene using cDNA microarray. full-length cDNA OsPDK1 1498 bp encoded predicted polypeptide 363 amino acids. Genomic DNA analysis showed presence another isoform PDK, OsPDK2, rice. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed differential expression two isoforms. OsPDK1 expressed leaf blade leaf sheath callus root, OsPDK2 expressed constitutively tissues examined. Maximum expression OsPDK1 leaf sheath detected Northern blot analysis seedlings treated 5 microM GA3 24 h. OsPDK1 expression up-regulated GA3, little effect plant hormones. Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity reduced compared control plants 2-week-old seedlings treated GA3. beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, mainly expressed aleurone layer germinating seed leaf sheath. Transgenic rice expressing PDK1 RNAi altered vegetative growth reduced accumulation vegetative tissues. results suggest gibberellin modulates activity mtPDC regulating OsPDK1 expression subsequently controlling plant growth development.
