 Central memory (T(CM)) transitional memory (T(TM)) CD4(+) cells known major cellular reservoirs HIV, cells harbor transcriptionally silent form viral DNA targeted either immune system current antiretroviral drug regimens. present study, explored molecular bases anti-HIV reservoir effects auranofin (AF), pro-oxidant gold-based drug candidate compound cure AIDS. show T(CM) T(TM) lymphocytes lower baseline antioxidant defenses compared naive counterpart. differences mirrored effects exerted AF T-lymphocytes: AF able exert pro-differentiating pro-apoptotic effect, pronounced memory subsets. AF induced early activation p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) followed mitochondrial depolarization final burst intracellular peroxides. pro-differentiating effect characterized downregulation CD27 marker expression. Interestingly, AF-induced apoptosis inhibited pyruvate, well-known peroxide scavenger, pyruvate inhibit pro-differentiating effect AF, indicating pro-apoptotic pro-differentiating effects involve different pathways. conclusion, results demonstrate AF selectively targets T(CM)/T(TM) lymphocyte subsets, encompass HIV reservoir, affecting redox-sensitive cell death pathways.
