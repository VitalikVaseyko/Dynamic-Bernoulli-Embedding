 RNA interference (RNAi) powerful tool identifying gene function Trypanosoma brucei. generated RNAi library, first kind organism, ligation genomic fragments vector pZJMbeta. transfection approximately 5-fold genome coverage, trypanosomes induced express double-stranded RNA screened reduced con canavalin (conA) binding. Since lectin binds surface glycoprotein EP-procyclin, predicted cells would lose affinity conA RNAi silenced genes affecting EP-procyclin expression modification. found cell line RNAi switches expression glycosylated EP-procyclins unglycosylated GPEET-procyclin. switch results silencing hexokinase gene. relationship procyclin expression glycolysis supported silencing genes glycolytic pathway, confirmed observation similar upregulation GPEET- procyclin parental cells grown medium depleted glucose. data suggest T.brucei 'senses' changes glucose level modulates procyclin expression accordingly.
