 Multiple infarcts produced cerebral hemispheres rats injecting calibrated 50-micron microspheres left internal carotid artery, alterations lipid energy metabolism evaluated 24 hours later embolized hemisphere. Total phospholipid content decreased 26%, different classes phospholipids equally affected. Phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylserine levels decreased 40% phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine 25%, sphingomyelin level remained unchanged. 3.2-fold increase total free fatty acid content relatively larger rise polyunsaturated free fatty acids 20:4 22:6 (20-fold increase). Determination enzyme activities showed decreases Na+,K+-ATPase (-21%) hexokinase (-14%) changes phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Study energy metabolism using closed system method Lowry et al showed significant depression (-36%) cerebral metabolic rate. Taken together, data suggest relation lipid alterations dysfunction energy metabolism. Phospholipid degradation subsequent free fatty acid release alteration membrane-bound enzymes may direct effect metabolic machinery may slow cerebral metabolic rate.
