 PURPOSE: determine whether activity carbohydrate metabolism enzymes (aldolase, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase) altered glaucomatous trabecular meshwork (TM) compared controls. METHODS: Tissue specimens obtained trabeculectomy (n=45 open angle glaucoma; Caucasian, average age 61+/-8 years age genders) cadaver eyes (n=15 control n=5 glaucoma; Caucasian, average age 63+/-4 years genders). Protein extracts TM tissue prepared non-denaturing buffer containing 0.1% genapol. Aldolase activity measured spectrophotometrically 240 nm absorbance using reaction 3-phosphoglycerate hydrazine form hydrazone. Pyruvate kinase activity measured coupling lactate dehydrogenase NADPH pyruvate absorbance measured 340 nm. Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity measured using reduction NADP NADPH characteristic absorbance 340 nm. Malate dehydrogenase catalyzes interconversion L-malate oxaloacetate using NADP coenzyme, quantified absorbance 340 nm. RESULTS: Aldolase, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehyrogenase activities glaucomatous TM tissue found reduced 70, 50, 25, 69 percent, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis suggests presence 4-hydorxynonenal (HNE) modified isocitrate dehydrogenase protein glaucomatous TM tissue compared controls. CONCLUSIONS: Several Krebs cycle enzyme activities considerably reduced glaucomatous TM. HNE modified isocitrate dehydrogenase activity consistent reduced inactivated form protein. Lipid peroxidation product modification aldolase, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase serves likely reason reduction enzyme activity.
