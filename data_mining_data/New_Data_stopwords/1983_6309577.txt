 central theme paper reconstitution Warburg effect, high aerobic glycolysis malignant tumors. history resolution-reconstitution started isolation glycolytic enzymes. 1945 Meyerhof prepared extract yeast ferment unless ATPase added. extract Ehrlich ascites tumor cells glycolyze presence catalytic amounts Pi nucleotides without addition ATPase presented model future reconstitutions Warburg effect. Natural polypeptide preparations placenta hypothalamus 1) stimulate protein kinase tumor plasma membranes, 2) serve substrates another protein kinase tumor plasma membranes, 3) stimulate glycolysis normal rat chick embryo fibroblasts may related transforming tumor growth factors. hope exploration mechanism polypeptides stimulate glycolysis could lead successful reconstitution Warburg effect vitro system. may also help us understand tumor RNA malignant DNA induces various biochemical changes take place normal cells transformed tumor cells.
