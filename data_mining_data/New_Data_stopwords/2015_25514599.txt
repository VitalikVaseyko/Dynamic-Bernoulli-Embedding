 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) member pyruvate kinase family. Recent work defined "non-metabolic" functions PKM2. However, role PKM2 HCC remains unclear. investigate role PKM2 tumor growth, invasion prognosis hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PKM2 expression measured HCC cell lines tissues using qRT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence assays. vitro experiments, PKM2 knocked using short hairpin RNA lentivirus vector, tumor cell behavior downstream signaling pathways chemokine analyzed. analysis vivo tumor growth, intratumoral peritumoral lymphocyte infiltration examined nude mice. prognostic value PKM2 analyzed immunohistochemistry two cohorts including 721 HCC patients. Together, data obtained cell lines, tumorigenicity studies, primary HCC samples illustrate oncogenic role PKM2 tumors. Moreover, PKM2 may serve novel prognostic indicator HCC patients curative resection, targeted therapy aimed PKM2 may represent effective treatment approach HCC.
