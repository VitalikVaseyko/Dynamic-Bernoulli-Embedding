 BACKGROUND PURPOSE: Ischemic stroke induces metabolic disarray. central regulatory site, pyruvate dehydrogeanse complex (PDHC) sits cross-roads 2 fundamental metabolic pathways: aerobic anaerobic. study, combined ethanol (EtOH) normobaric oxygen (NBO) develop novel treatment modulate PDHC regulatory proteins, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, leading improved metabolism reduced oxidative damage. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats subjected transient (2, 3, 4 hours) middle cerebral artery occlusion followed 3- 24-hour reperfusion, permanent (28 hours) middle cerebral artery occlusion without reperfusion. 2 hours onset ischemia, rats received either intraperitoneal injection saline, 1 dose EtOH (1.5 g/kg) 2- 3-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion, 2 doses EtOH (1.5 g/kg followed 1.0 g/kg 2 hours) 4 hours permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, EtOH+95% NBO (at 2 hours onset ischemia 6 hours) permanent stroke. Infarct volumes neurological deficits examined. Oxidative metabolism stress determined measuring ADP/ATP ratio reactive oxygen species levels. Protein levels PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase assessed. RESULTS: EtOH induced dose-dependent neuroprotection transient ischemia. Compared EtOH NBO alone, NBO+EtOH produced best outcomes permanent ischemia. therapies improved brain oxidative metabolism decreasing ADP/ATP ratios reactive oxygen species levels, association significantly raised levels PDHC pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, well decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. CONCLUSIONS: EtOH EtOH+NBO treatments conferred neuroprotection severe stroke affecting brain metabolism. treatment may modulate damaging cascade metabolic events bringing PDHC activity back normal metabolic levels.
