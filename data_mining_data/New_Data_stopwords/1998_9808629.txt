 Aging, senescence, progressive deterioration every bodily function time. fundamental question applies life forms, including growth-arrested bacteria, growing older necessity causes organisms grow fragile. work, demonstrate levels oxidized proteins correlated age stationary-phase Escherichia coli culture; disulfide bridge formation cytoplasmic leader-less alkaline phosphatase protein carbonyl levels increase stasis. stasis-induced increase protein oxidation enhanced cells lacking global regulators OxyR sigmas. proteins found specifically susceptible stasis-induced oxidation; notably several TCA cycle enzymes, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, pyruvate kinase, DnaK, H-NS. Evidence oxidation target proteins stasis serves signal stationary-phase, developmental, induction heat shock regulon presented demonstrating induction mitigated overproducing superoxide dismutase SodA. addition, cells lacking cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase activity exhibit superinduction heat shock proteins. possibility oxidative sensitivity TCA cycle enzymes serves feedback mechanism down-regulating toxic respiration discussed.
