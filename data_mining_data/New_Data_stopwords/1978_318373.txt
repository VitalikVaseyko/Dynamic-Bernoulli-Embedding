 1. relationships food intake self-selection liver substrates (glycogen, fat) activities pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, acetyl CoA carboxylase, glucose-6-phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase determined spontaneous variations body weight dormouse. 2. results show phase increasing body weight, carbohydrate intake enzyme activities involved lipogenesis high level. 3. last part body weight increasing phase, lipid intake occurs, lipogenesis depressed gluconeogenetic activity set on, total caloric intake important body weight still increasing. 4. metabolic changes interpreted preparation hibernating conditions dormouse.
