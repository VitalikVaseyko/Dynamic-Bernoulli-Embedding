 Hereditary spastic paraplegias, group neurodegenerative disorders, caused loss-of-function mutations protein spartin. However, physiological role spartin remains largely elusive. show heterologous expression human Drosophila spartin extends chronological lifespan yeast, reducing age-associated ROS production, apoptosis, necrosis. demonstrate spartin localizes proximity mitochondria physically interacts proteins related mitochondrial respiratory metabolism. Interestingly, Nde1, mitochondrial external NADH dehydrogenase, Pda1, core enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, required spartin-mediated cytoprotection. Furthermore, spartin interacts glycolysis enhancer phospo-fructo-kinase-2,6 (Pfk26) sufficient complement PFK26-deficiency least early aging. conclude mitochondria-related energy metabolism crucial spartin's vital function aging uncover network specific interactors required function.
