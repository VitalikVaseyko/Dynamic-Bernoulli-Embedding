 Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation brains patients Alzheimer's disease (AD) closely associated increased nerve cell death. However, many cells survive important understand mechanisms involved survival response. Recent studies shown anti-apoptotic mechanism cancer cells mediated aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect. One major regulators aerobic glycolysis pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), enzyme represses mitochondrial respiration forces cell rely heavily glycolysis, even presence oxygen. Recent neuroimaging studies shown spatial distribution aerobic glycolysis brains AD patients strongly correlates Abeta deposition. Interestingly, clonal nerve cell lines selected resistance Abeta exhibit increased glycolysis result activation transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1. show Abeta resistant nerve cell lines upregulate Warburg effect enzymes manner reminiscent cancer cells. particular, Abeta resistant nerve cell lines showed elevated PDK1 expression addition increase lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) activity lactate production compared control cells. addition, mitochondrial derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) markedly diminished resistant sensitive cells. Chemically genetically inhibiting LDHA PDK1 re-sensitized resistant cells Abeta toxicity. findings suggest Warburg effect may contribute apoptotic-resistance mechanisms surviving neurons AD brain. Loss adaptive advantage afforded aerobic glycolysis may exacerbate pathophysiological processes associated AD.
