 Development colorectal cancer considered result imbalance pro- anti-inflammatory intestinal microenvironment accompanied macrophage recruitment. Despite macrophages implicated remodeling tumor microenvironment, mechanism macrophage recruitment fully elucidated yet. study, reported clinical association highly expressed pyruvate kinase M2 colorectal cancer macrophage attraction. conditioned medium Caco-2 HT-29 cells depleted pyruvate kinase M2 dramatically reduced macrophage recruitment, reversed addition of, critical chemotaxis factor macrophage migration, rCCL2. Silencing endogenous pyruvate kinase M2 markedly decreased CCL2 expression secretion real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Endogenous pyruvate kinase M2 interacted p65 mediated nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway mainly regulated phosphorylation Ser276 p65 nuclear factor-kappaB. addition, inhibition macrophage recruitment caused pyruvate kinase M2 silencing rescued ectopic expression p65. Interestingly, pyruvate kinase M2 highly expressed colorectal cancer tissue, correction macrophage distribution. Taken together, revealed novel mechanism pyruvate kinase M2 promoting colorectal cancer progression recruitment macrophages p65 nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated expression CCL2.
