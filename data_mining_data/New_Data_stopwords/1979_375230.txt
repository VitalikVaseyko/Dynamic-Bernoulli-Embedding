 Escherichia coli, acetyl phosphate formed acetyl-CoA via phosphotransacetylase (phosphate acetyltransferase; acetyl-CoA:orthophosphate acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.8) reaction acetate (plus ATP) via acetate kinase (ATP:acetate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.1) reaction. restricting acetyl phosphate formation phosphotransacetylase reaction alone, use metabolic inhibitors, able show that, pyruvate source energy, mutants defective phosphotransacetylase unable transport glutamine, histidine, methionine. However, energy source, mutants defective acetate kinase normal transport amino acids. inability phosphotransacetylase mutants transport due presumed inability form acetyl phosphate, pyruvate found metabolized acetyl-CoA mutants. Thus acetyl phosphate implicated active transport. Evidence also presented neither protonmotive force ecf gene product required shock-sensitive transport systems.
