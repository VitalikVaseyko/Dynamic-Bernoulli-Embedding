 OBJECTIVE: Adipose tissue (AT)-specific inflammation considered mediate pathological consequences obesity macrophages known activate inflammatory pathways obese AT. cyclooxygenases play central role regulating inflammatory processes, sought determine role hematopoietic cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) modulating inflammation obesity. MATERIALS/METHODS: Bone marrow transplantation performed delete COX-1 hematopoietic cells. Briefly, female wild type (wt) mice lethally irradiated injected bone marrow (BM) cells collected wild type (COX-1+/+) COX-1 knock-out (COX-1-/-) donor mice. mice fed high fat diet 16 weeks. RESULTS: mice received COX-1-/- bone marrow (BM-COX-1-/-) exhibited significant increase fasting glucose, total cholesterol triglycerides circulation compared control (BM-COX-1+/+) mice. Markers AT-inflammation increased associated increased leptin decreased adiponectin plasma. Hepatic inflammation reduced concomitant reduction TXB2 levels. hepatic mRNA expression genes involved lipogenesis lipid transport increased expression genes involved regulating hepatic glucose output reduced BM-COX-1-/- mice. Finally, renal inflammation markers renal glucose release increased BM-COX-1-/- mice. CONCLUSION: Hematopoietic COX-1 deletion results impairments metabolic homeostasis may partly due increased inflammation dysregulated adipokine profile. increase renal glucose release hepatic lipogenesis/lipid transport may also play role, least part, mediating hyperglycemia dyslipidemia, respectively.
