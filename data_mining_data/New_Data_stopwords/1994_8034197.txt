 Band 3 rabbit erythrocytes binding site staphylococcal alpha-toxin. Young erythrocytes functionally intact band 3 100 kD hydrolysed cells age 35-kD fragment. Consequently, aging erythrocytes renders resistant action toxin. Thus age blood sample reduce sensitivity hemolytic assay contribute variation assay.
