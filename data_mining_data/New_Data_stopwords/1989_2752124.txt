 Studies reticulocyte maturation limited inability obtain pure populations age-synchronized reticulocytes absence well-defined methods maturation reticulocytes vitro. Many problems overcome using temporary suppression erythropoiesis thiamphenicol phlebotomy resulting highly reproducible reticulocyte response, Percoll density gradient separation cells yielding essentially pure populations age-synchronized reticulocytes, liquid culture techniques cell lysis minimal. system allows reproducible study well-defined cohorts reticulocytes mature erythrocytes. vitro maturation serially monitored changes reticulocyte count, glucose consumption, 125I-transferrin binding, fluorescein (FITC)-labeled transferrin binding, activities four erythrocyte enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase) appearance cells scanning electron microscopy. variables changed different rates suggesting multiple mechanisms underlie maturational events. Transferrin binding reticulocyte count decreased rapidly reached values near zero three four days culture. four enzyme activities decreased much slowly, two reached pretreatment values seven days culture. contrast findings others, scanning electron microscopy suggested cells assume normal biconcave shape system. methods described make feasible study process reticulocyte maturation vitro. data presented represent first step study coordination interrelationships various maturational processes.
