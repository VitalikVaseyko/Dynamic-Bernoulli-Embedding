 Spirochaeta thermophila RI 19.B1 (DSM 6192) fermented glucose lactate, acetate, CO2, H2 concomitant formation cell material. cell dry mass yield 20.0 g/mol glucose. fermentation balance data knowledge fermentation pathway, YATP 9.22 g dry mass per mol ATP calculated pH-uncontrolled batch-culture growth glucose mineral medium. Measurement enzyme activities glucose-grown cells revealed glucose taken permease subjected ATP-dependent phosphorylation hexokinase. Glucose-6-phosphate metabolized pyruvate Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. phosphoryl donor phosphofructokinase activity PPi rather ATP. also found type strain S. thermophila, Z-1203 (DSM 6578). PPi probably formed pyrophosphoroclastic cleavage ATP, recovery resultant AMP activity adenylate kinase. measured kinase activities utilized ATP phosphoryl donor. Pyruvate metabolized acetyl coenzyme concomitant production H2 CO2 pyruvate synthase. Lactate also produced pyruvate fructose-1,6-diphosphate-insensitive lactate dehydrogenase. Evidence obtained transfer reducing equivalents glycolytic pathway hydrogenase produce H2. formate dehydrogenase significant ethanol-producing enzyme activities detected.
