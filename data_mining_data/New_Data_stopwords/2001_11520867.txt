 improve efficiency CO(2) fixation C(3) photosynthesis, C(4)-cycle genes overexpressed potato tobacco plants either individually combination. Overexpression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) gene (ppc) Corynebacterium glutamicum (cppc) potato (stppc, deprived phosphorylation site) potato resulted 3-6-fold induction endogenous cytosolic NADP malic enzyme (ME) increase activities NAD-ME (3-fold), NADP isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), NADP glycerate-3-P dehydrogenase (NADP-GAPDH), PEP phosphatase (PEPP). double transformants overexpressing cppc chloroplastic NADP-ME Flaveria pringlei (fpMe1), cytosolic NADP-ME less induced pleiotropic effects diminished. changes enzyme pattern single fpMe1 overexpressors. cppc overexpressors tobacco, increase endogenous cytosolic NADP-ME activity small changes enzymes less pronounced. Determinations CO(2) compensation point (Gamma*) well temperature oxygen effects photosynthesis produced variational data suggesting desired decline photorespiration occurred certain experimental conditions. Double transformants potato (cppc/fpMe1) exhibited consistent attenuating effect photorespiration. contrast, photorespiration tobacco plants appeared diminished single cppc overexpressors rather double transformants (cppc/fpMe1). tobacco, introduction PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti (pck) little effect photosynthetic parameters single (pck) double transformants (cppc/pck). transgenic potato plants, increased PEPC activities resulted decline UV protectants (flavonoids) single cppc stppc transformants, double transformants (cppc/fpMe1). PEP provision shikimate pathway inside plastids, flavonoids derive, might restricted single PEPC overexpressors.
