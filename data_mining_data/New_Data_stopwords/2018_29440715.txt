 Metabolism cancer cells characterized aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect. Aerobic glycolysis reduces pyruvate flux mitochondria, preventing complete oxidation glucose shunting glucose anabolic pathways essential cell proliferation. tested new strategy, mitochondrial uncoupling, potential antagonizing anabolic effect aerobic glycolysis potential anticancer activities. Mitochondrial uncoupling process facilitates proton influx across mitochondrial inner membrane without generating ATP, stimulating futile cycle acetyl- CoA oxidation. tested two safe mitochondrial uncouplers, NEN (niclosamide ethanolamine) oxyclozanide, metabolic effects anti-cancer activities. used metabolomic NMR examine effect mitochondrial uncoupling glucose metabolism colon cancer MC38 cells. tested anti-cancer effect NEN oxyclozanide cultured cell models, APC(min/+) mouse model, metastatic colon cancer mouse model. Using metabolomic NMR approach, demonstrated mitochondrial uncoupling promotes pyruvate influx mitochondria reduces various anabolic pathway activities. Moreover, mitochondrial uncoupling inhibits cell proliferation reduces clonogenicity cultured colon cancer cells. Furthermore, oral treatment mitochondrial uncouplers reduces intestinal polyp formation APC(min/+) mice, diminishes hepatic metastasis colon cancer cells transplanted intrasplenically. data highlight unique approach targeting cancer cell metabolism cancer prevention treatment, identified two prototype compounds, shed light anti-cancer mechanism niclosamide.
