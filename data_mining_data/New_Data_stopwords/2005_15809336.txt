 effects salts rate constants inactivation heat yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) 60.0 degrees C measured. Different effects observed low high salt concentrations. high concentrations, salts stabilizing effects, others destabilizing. effects salts high concentration range examined described follows: (decreased thermal stability) NaClO(4) < NaI = (C(2)H(5))(4)NBr < NH(4)Br < NaBr = KBr = CsBr = (no addition) < (CH(3))(4)NBr < KCl < KF < Na(2)SO(4) (increased thermal stability). decreasing effect NaClO(4) YADH controlled thermal stability enzyme absolutely compensated addition Na(2)SO(4), salt stabilized enzyme. However, Na(2)SO(4) compensation occur response decrease thermal stability caused (C(2)H(5))(4)NBr. rate constants inactivation heat (k (in)) enzyme measured various temperatures. Effective values thermodynamic activation parameters thermal inactivation, activation free energy (DeltaG (double dagger)), activation enthalpy (DeltaH (double dagger)), activation entropy (DeltaS (double dagger)), determined. thermal stability YADH 0.8 Na(2)SO(4) increased pyruvate kinase Bacillus stearothermophilus, moderate thermophile. changes values DeltaH (double dagger) DeltaS (double dagger) great showed general compensatory tendency, exception case NaClO(4). temperature general compensation effect (T (c)) approximately 123 degrees C. Na(2)SO(4), thermal stability YADH temperature (c) greater absence salt due higher values DeltaH (double dagger) DeltaS (double dagger), respectively, thus example low-temperature enzymatic stabilization. (C(2)H(5))(4)NBr, thermal stability YADH temperature (c) lower absence salt due lower values DeltaH (double dagger) DeltaS (double dagger), respectively, thus example low-temperature enzymatic destabilization. NaClO(4), changes values DeltaH (double dagger) DeltaS (double dagger) small thermal stability YADH thus example high-temperature enzymatic destabilization.
