 Erythrocyte activities G6PD PK, referenced creatine content, presented means detect enzyme deficiencies despite presence variable proportions young erythrocytes assayed cell population. Lysate enzyme activities, creatine hemoglobin concentrations, whole blood reticulocyte counts determined 110 samples 87 patients variety anemias, including two pyruvate kinase deficient, three G6PD deficient, four proven G6PD heterozygotes. Highest correlations obtained log G6PD activity/g hemoglobin lysate creatine, PK activity/g hemoglobin lysate creatine. Ninety-five percent limits population presented creatine concentrations 28 mg/dl, corresponding 20% reticulocyte count. addition providing reference intervals appropriate suspect patient population, data afford greater confidence detecting partial enzyme deficiencies concomitant hemolytic processes, hemoglobinopathies.
