 means proposed evaluating enzyme effectiveness vivo via simplified dynamic description metabolic reaction network within enzyme operates. basis method application sensitivity analysis quasi-steady approximation complete dynamic model, implementation centers interpreting transient relations selected intermediates following perturbation system interest: many important situations relations simply interpreted give useful global measure enzyme effectiveness. method found successful estimating phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activity human red cell, appears promising basis developing means detecting enzyme abnormalities caused environmental genetic factors. method may also prove useful comparative studies glycolysis different types cells. analysis presented based available models red cell glycolysis, results highly sensitive ambiguities system model. approach suggested appears provide effective means describing system dynamics determining behavior individual enzyme intact system making first-order allowance interaction system whole. Requirements success approach remain identified detail, effective time-scale separation probably key.
