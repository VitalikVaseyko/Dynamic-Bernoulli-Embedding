 gamma-Glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL) combines cysteine glutamate gamma carboxyl moiety first step glutathione (GSH) synthesis considered rate-limiting enzyme pathway. enzyme heterodimer, heavy catalytic light regulatory subunit, plays critical role anti-oxidant response. Besides original method Seelig designed measurement purified enzyme, endpoint methods, often unrefined, available measuring complex biological samples. describe new, fast reliable kinetic LC/MS method enabled us optimize detection. l-2-Aminobutyrate used instead cysteine (to avoid glutathione synthetase interference) triggering substrate saturating concentrations glutamate ATP; gamma glutamylaminobutyrate formed measured m/z=233 regular time intervals. Reaction rate maximum ATP held constant enzymatic recycling ADP pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate. repeatability method good, CV% 6.5 4% catalytic activities at, respectively 0.9 34 U/l. affinities rat human enzymes glutamate aminobutyrate good agreement previous published data. However, unlike rat enzyme, human GCL sensitive reduced glutathione displays basic optimum pH.
