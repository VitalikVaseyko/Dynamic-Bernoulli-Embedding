 African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, withstand extremely arid conditions aestivation, resulting dehydration urea accumulation. Aestivating X. laevis reduce metabolic rate, rely anaerobic glycolysis meet reduced ATP demands. present study investigated severe dehydration affected transcript levels, kinetic profile, phosphorylation state key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) liver skeletal muscle X. laevis. Compared control frogs, severely dehydrated frogs showed increase transcript abundance liver muscle isoforms PK. kinetics muscle PK differ dehydrated control frogs, PK liver dehydrated frogs lower Km phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (38%), lower Ka fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6P2) (32%), greater activation PK via F1,6P2 (1.56-fold). PK dehydrated frogs also lower phosphorylation-state (25%) comparison enzyme control frogs liver. Experimental manipulation phosphorylation-state liver PK taken control frogs endogenous protein phosphatases resulted decreased phosphorylation, similar kinetic profile seen dehydrated frogs. physiological consequence dehydration-induced PK modification appears adjust PK function remain active metabolically depressed state. study provides evidence maintenance PK activity elevated mRNA levels dephosphorylation event activates frog liver PK dehydrated state order facilitate production ATP via anaerobic glycolysis.
