 1. work investigated hepatic glycogen synthesis glucose output intragastric administration glucose glycerol provision chow ad libitum 48 h-starved euthyroid hyperthyroid rats. 2. glucose administration, glycogen synthesis via indirect pathway [Newgard, Hirsch, Foster & McGarry (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8046-8052] occurred concomitantly reversal glucose flux across liver re-activation pyruvate kinase euthyroid controls. Glycogen synthesis decreased net glucose output continued hyperthyroid rats, normal re-activation pyruvate kinase observed. 3. Use 3-mercaptopicolinate indicated glucose released liver hyperthyroid rats synthesized substrates metabolized via gluconeogenic pathway. 4. Hepatic glycogen synthesis also impaired hyperthyroid rats administration glycerol chow. Measurement portal-minus-hepatovenous concentration differences arterial glucose concentrations administration glycerol combination 3-mercaptopicolinate indicated flux triose phosphate glucose 6-phosphate decreased. 5. Inhibited glycogen synthesis chow re-feeding associated accelerated re-activation hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex hyperthyroid rats. 6. results indicate three distinct independent actions hyperthyroidism re-feeding: (i) inhibits reversal glucose flux across liver normally observed response carbohydrate; (ii) affects glycogen deposition site distal glucose 6-phosphate; (iii) allows rapid re-activation liver pyruvate dehydrogenase complex response mixed diet.
