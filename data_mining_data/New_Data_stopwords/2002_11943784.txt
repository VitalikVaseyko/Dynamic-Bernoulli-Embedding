 Cancer cells display high rates aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known historically Warburg effect. Lactate pyruvate, end products glycolysis, highly produced cancer cells even presence oxygen. Hypoxia-induced gene expression cancer cells linked malignant transformation. provide evidence lactate pyruvate regulate hypoxia-inducible gene expression independently hypoxia stimulating accumulation hypoxia-inducible Factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). human gliomas cancer cell lines, accumulation HIF-1alpha protein aerobic conditions requires metabolism glucose pyruvate prevents aerobic degradation HIF-1alpha protein, activates HIF-1 DNA binding activity, enhances expression several HIF-1-activated genes including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 3, aldolase A. findings support novel role pyruvate metabolic signaling suggest mechanism high rates aerobic glycolysis promote malignant transformation survival cancer cells.
