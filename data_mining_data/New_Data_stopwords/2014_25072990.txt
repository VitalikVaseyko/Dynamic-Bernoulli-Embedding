 Populations edge geographic distributions referred peripheral populations. little attention given topic context persistence infectious disease natural populations. study, examined question using zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused Leishmania major Negev Desert Israel model system. Here, suggest regional persistence Phlebotomus papatasi populations L. major transmission Sede Boqer region could explained processes akin sink-source and/or mainland-island metapopulation dynamics. Given potentially enzootically superior ecological conditions, hypothesize Zin Valley ecotope constitutes "mainland" "source" patch Sede Boqer area L. major transmission persistent resistant local extinctions (die-outs) whereas local sand fly populations Zin Plateau ("island patch" "sink patch") prone local extinctions. 2007 2008, trapped sand flies sand rats two areas compared sand fly abundance L. major infection prevalence both. 2007 2008, sand fly abundance high continuous Zin Wadi low discontinuous Zin Plateau. Infection prevalence sand rats significantly higher Wadi (13%) compared Zin Plateau (3%). Minimum infection rate sand flies differ significantly two areas. Overall, results consistent premise Zin Valley population relatively robust terms L. major transmission, whereas transmission potentially tenuous plateau.
