 assessed daily patterns parameters involved energy metabolism liver, white muscle, gills rainbow trout. daily rhythms found, analyzed potential influence feeding. Immature rainbow trout randomly distributed 3 groups: fish fed 7 days, fish fasted 7 days, fish fasted 7 days refed 4 days. sampling day, fish fed refed groups fed 11.00 h, fish sampled treatment group using following time schedule: 14.00, 18.00, 21.00, 00.00, 04.00, 07.00, 10.00 14.00 h. results obtained metabolic parameters grouped four different categories, i) displaying daily changes group assessed liver (acetoacetate lactate levels), white muscle (protein levels, low Km (glucose) hexokinase (HK) HK-IV activities) gills (protein levels), ii) displaying 24 h changes fed fish refed fasted fish liver (glucose, glycogen, amino acid protein levels, HK-IV activity), white muscle (glycogen amino acid levels) gills (glucose levels), iii) displaying 24 h changes apparently dependent feeding since disappear fasted fish liver (Low Km (glucose) HK, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-O), glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) , alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) aspartate aminotransferase (Asp-AT) activities), white muscle (glucose levels, pyruvate kinase (PK), LDH-O, G3PDH Asp-AT activities) gills (glycogen lactate levels, Low Km (glucose) HK, HK-IV, LDH-O Asp-AT activities), iv) parameters displaying 24 h changes apparently dependent feeding liver (lactate levels PK activity) gills (amino acid levels, PK GDH activities). general, 24 h changes observed dependent feeding also related daily changes activity.
