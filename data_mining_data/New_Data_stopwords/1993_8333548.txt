 Steady-state active stress smooth muscle maintained cross bridges undergo continuous cycling myosin phosphorylation, two processes consume ATP. study, investigated whether energy utilization cross-bridge cycling myosin phosphorylation compartmentalized examined relative affinities ATP airway smooth muscle. measured active stress, myosin phosphorylation, O2 consumption, tissue ATP content bovine tracheal smooth muscle activated K+ depolarization glucose replaced pyruvate oxidative metabolism inhibited hypoxia uncoupled 2,4-dinitrophenol. results indicate ATP produced glycolysis oxidative metabolism available cross-bridge cycling myosin phosphorylation. However, steady-state myosin phosphorylation insensitive inhibition oxidative metabolism hypoxia mitochondrial uncoupling steady-state isometric stress tissue ATP content significantly reduced. results suggest that, relative actomyosin adenosine 5'-triphosphatase, myosin light chain kinase higher affinity ATP intact airway smooth muscle. However, peak myosin phosphorylation associated initial rapid stress development sensitive inhibition oxidative metabolism, probably reflecting lower content intracellular calcium store result metabolic inhibition.
