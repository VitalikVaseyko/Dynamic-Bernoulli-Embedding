 Tumorigenesis involves energy production aerobic glycolysis ("Warburg effect") malignant tumors. One key enzymes transketolase. Transketolase, transketolase-like-1 (TKTL1), transketolase-like-2 known. Antibodies TKTL1 exist immunohistochemical investigations. study investigated influence TKTL1 survival metastasizing 40 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs, T2-T4, 27 metastasized). Staining assessed immunoreactive score (IRS) values 0 12 primaries nodal metastases. highest IRS 8. Normal epithelium show expression. Three SCCs negative. Advanced SCCs higher IRS lower stages. IRS>4 associated shorter disease specific survival, independent tumor stage multivariate analysis. Significant differences metastasized non-metastasized SCCs absent, poorly differentiated SCCs higher IRS metastases moderate differentiated SCCs. TKTL1 overexpression associated aggressive behavior shorter survival laryngeal SCCs. observations could lead additional therapeutic options targeting blocking enzyme activity.
