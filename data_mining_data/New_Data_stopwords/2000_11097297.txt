 previously demonstrated susceptibility Leishmania sp. glibenclamide, K+ -ATP transport blocker interacts members superfamily adenosine 5' triphosphate-binding cassette transporters. order characterize molecular differences sensitive Leishmania strain, NR(Gs), experimentally selected glibenclamide-resistant strain, NR(Gr), specific biochemical functional parameters evaluated wild type resistant strain. noteworthy, NR(Gr) exhibit increased expression P-glycoprotein decreased activity functional key enzymes acid phosphatase, prominent virulent factor parasite, pyruvate kinase, key control enzyme carbohydrate protein metabolism. specific biochemical, metabolic functional changes observed resistant strain correlated reduced infectivity stationary phase NR(Gr) J774 macrophages suggested mechanism overcome effect glibenclamide.
