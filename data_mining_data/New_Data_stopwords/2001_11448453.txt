 short-term effect metformin fatty acid glucose metabolism studied freshly incubated hepatocytes 24-hr starved rats. Metformin (5 50 mM) effect oleate octanoate oxidation rates (CO(2)+ acid-soluble products), whatever concentration used. Similarly, metformin effect oleate esterification (triglycerides phospholipid synthesis) regardless whether hepatocytes isolated starved (low esterification rates) fed rats (high esterification rates). contrast, metformin markedly reduced rates glucose production lactate/pyruvate, alanine, dihydroxyacetone, galactose. Using crossover plot experiments, shown main effect metformin hepatic gluconeogenesis located upstream formation dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Increasing time exposure metformin (24 hr instead 1 hr) led significant changes expression genes involved glucose fatty acid metabolism. Indeed, hepatocytes cultured presence 50 500 microM metformin, expression genes encoding regulatory proteins fatty acid oxidation (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I), ketogenesis (mitochondrial hydroxymethylgltaryl-CoA synthase), gluconeogenesis (glucose 6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) decreased 30 60%, whereas expression genes encoding regulatory proteins involved glycolysis (glucokinase liver-type pyruvate kinase) increased 250%. conclusion, work suggests metformin could reduce hepatic glucose production short-term (metabolic) long-term (genic) effects.
