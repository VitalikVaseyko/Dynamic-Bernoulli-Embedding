 5'-flanking region S14 gene -4316 +18 contains regulatory sequences responsible activation promoter activity response elevated carbohydrate metabolism primary hepatocytes. map sequences, series constructs containing various internal deletions S14 5'-flanking sequence assayed primary hepatocytes. region -1601 -1395 found essential response. Comparison sequence S14 region region L-type pyruvate kinase gene shown mediate carbohydrate regulation (Thompson, K. S., Towle, H. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 8679-8682) revealed segment 9 10 identity. cases, conserved sequence aligned DNase footprint formed hepatic nuclear extract. Oligonucleotides (approximately 30 base pairs) either S14 pyruvate kinase genes containing conserved element bound hepatic nuclear factor(s) gave identical complexes mobility shift assay. Furthermore, two oligonucleotides cross-competed binding nuclear factor(s), suggesting common factor(s) binds conserved element. Reinsertion S14 oligonucleotide unresponsive S14 promoter construct restored carbohydrate control. Moreover, oligonucleotide could confer glucose response fused heterologous promoter. Thus, S14 segment -1457 -1428 carbohydrate response element essential binding nuclear factor(s) regulated increased carbohydrate metabolism. factor(s) may common carbohydrate regulation S14 pyruvate kinase genes.
