 Vascular calcification, abnormal mineralization vessel wall, frequently associated aging, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease. Vascular calcification key risk factor many adverse clinical outcomes, including ischemic cardiac events subsequent cardiovascular mortality. Vascular calcification long considered passive degenerative process, recognized active highly regulated process similar bone formation. However, despite numerous studies pathogenesis vascular calcification, mechanisms driving process remain poorly understood. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) play important role regulation cellular metabolism mitochondrial function. Recent studies show PDK4 attractive therapeutic target treatment various metabolic diseases. review, summarize current knowledge regarding mechanisms vascular calcification describe role PDK4 osteogenic differentiation vascular smooth muscle cells development vascular calcification. studies aimed understanding molecular mechanisms vascular calcification critical development novel therapeutic strategies.
