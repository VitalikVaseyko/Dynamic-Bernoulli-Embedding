 scallops, gametogenesis leads mobilization glycogen proteins adductor muscle towards gonad. mobilization likely diminish metabolic capacities adductor muscle thereby scallops' escape response. examined escape response terms number valve claps exhaustion, rate clapping recovery valve closure adult scallops, Chlamys islandica, sampled different stages reproductive cycle (immature, mature, spawning). parallel, measured muscle glycogen, protein phosphoarginine contents, oxidative capacity mitochondria isolated adductor muscle levels muscle enzymes active exercise recovery. number claps (24-26), rate clapping ( approximately 13 clapsmin(-1)) phosphoarginine arginine kinase levels similar different reproductive stages. immature scallops responded restimulation immediately opening valves, 62% mature, 82% prespawned 38% spawned scallops responded. Immature animals completely recovered initial swimming capacity within 4 h opening valves, mature, prespawned spawned scallops needed 18, 12 18 h, respectively. Overall phasic adductor muscle mature, prespawned spawned animals showed decreased glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase (except prespawned), octopine dehydrogenase citrate synthase levels, deterioration oxidative capacity mitochondria marked decrease glycogen content compared immature scallops. Therefore, gonadal maturation spawning, C. islandica change clapping capacity, slowed recuperation exhausting burst exercise, valve closure, likely due decreased metabolic capacity adductor muscle.
