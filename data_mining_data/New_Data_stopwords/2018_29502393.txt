 OBJECTIVE: study performed understand transcriptional changes genes involved gluconeogenesis glycolysis pathways following castration bulls. METHODS: Twenty Korean bulls weaned average 3 months age, castrated 6 months. Liver tissues collected bulls (n = 10) steers (n = 10) Korean cattle, hepatic gene expression levels measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. examined hepatic transcription levels genes encoding enzymes irreversible reactions gluconeogenesis glycolysis well genes encoding enzymes utilization several glucogenic substrates. Correlations hepatic gene expression carcass characteristics performed understand associations. RESULTS: Castration increased mRNA (3.6 fold; p<0.01) protein levels (1.4 fold; p< 0.05) pyruvate carboxylase mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes (1.7 fold; p<0.05). Hepatic mRNA levels genes encoding glycolysis enzymes changed castration. Castration increased mRNA levels lactate dehydrogenase (1.5 fold; p<0.05) lactate dehydrogenase B (2.2 fold; p<0.01) genes lactate utilization. Castration increased mRNA levels glycerol kinase (2.7 fold; p<0.05) glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (1.5 fold; p<0.05) genes glycerol utilization. Castration also increased mRNA levels propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta (mitochondrial) (3.5 fold; p<0.01) acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 3 (1.3 fold; p = 0.06) genes propionate incorporation. CONCLUSION: Castration increases transcription levels critical genes coding enzymes involved irreversible gluconeogenesis reactions pyruvate glucose enzymes responsible incorporation glucogenic substrates including lactate, glycerol, propionate. Hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression levels associated intramuscular fat deposition.
