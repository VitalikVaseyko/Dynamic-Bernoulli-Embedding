 reaction leading flavinylation apo-6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase investigated cell-free extracts Eschericia coli carrying 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine oxidase (6-HDNO) gene expression plasmid pDB222. demonstrated reaction required phosphoenolpyruvate (P-pyruvate) addition FAD. [32P]P-pyruvate [14C]P-pyruvate used reaction apo-6-HDNO, phosphorylated pyruvylated apo-protein could detected, however. order drive reaction completion, FAD P-pyruvate present simultaneously reaction mixture. apo-6-HDNO, highly purified affinity chromatography, used reaction P-pyruvate FAD, additional protein fraction required. possible reaction scheme formation holoenzyme 6-HDNO discussed.
