 present study used model underperfusion anoxia followed reperfusion assess role glycolysis substituting pyruvate mannitol glucose substrate. Hearts removed male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-400 g) perfused technique Langendorff. perfusate Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer gassed 95% O2, 5% CO2 95% N2, 5% CO2 mixture containing substrates seen figures. mild ischemia obtained reducing perfusion pressure 70%, 60-70 cm H2O 10-20 cm H2O. coronary flow rapidly reduced 0.8 +/- 0.03 ml/min within first 5 minutes. mild ischemia anaerobic glycolysis accelerated lactate production ischemic hearts perfused glucose (36.2 +/- 15.3 microM/g/min-1) higher ischemic hearts perfused mannitol (6.8 +/- 1.9 microM/g/min-1). mild ischemia anoxia little difference rate release creatin-kinase substrates tested, major differences become apparent reperfusion. period highest values CK release found mannitol perfused hearts, lowest glucose perfused hearts. results suggest rate glycolytic flux mild ischemia anoxia may prevent enzyme release. beneficial effect glucose observed also reperfusion. fact enzyme release higher hearts reperfused glucose pyruvate. pyruvate exogenous substrate available isolated oxigenated hearts, tissue levels citric acid cycle intermediates high oxidation substrates account 100% oxygen consumption. Therefore suppose oxidation noncarbohydrate substrates pyruvate reperfusion complicated high mitochondrial damage. consequence anaerobic glycolytic pathway may play special role maintenance membrane integrity also early phases reperfusion.
