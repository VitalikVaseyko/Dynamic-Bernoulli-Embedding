 Aberrant expression Lin28 let-7 observed many human malignancies. However, functions underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. show aberrant expression Lin28 let-7 facilitates aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, cancer cells. Mechanistically, discover Lin28A Lin28B enhance, whereas let-7 suppresses, aerobic glycolysis via targeting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, PDK1, hypoxia- hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-independent manner, illustrating novel pathway mediate aerobic glycolysis cancer cells even ambient oxygen levels. Importantly, demonstrate PDK1 critical Lin28A- Lin28B-mediated cancer proliferation vitro vivo, establishing previously unappreciated mechanism Lin28/let-7 axis facilitates Warburg effect promote cancer progression. findings suggest potential rationale target PDK1 cancer therapy malignancies aberrant expression Lin28 let-7.
