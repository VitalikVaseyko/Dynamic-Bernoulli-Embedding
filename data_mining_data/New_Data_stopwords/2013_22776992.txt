 homobutanol fermentation pathway engineered derivative Escherichia coli B (glucose [glycolysis] => 2 pyruvate + 2 NADH; pyruvate [pyruvate dehydrogenase] => acetyl-CoA + NADH; 2 acetyl-CoA [butanol pathway enzymes] + 4 NADH => butanol; summary stoichiometry: glucose => butanol). Initially, native fermentation pathways eliminated E. coli B deleting genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), acetate kinase (ackA), fumarate reductase (frdABCD), pyruvate formate lyase (pflB), alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (aceEF-lpd) anaerobically expressed promoter replacement. resulting strain, E. coli EG03 (DeltafrdABCD DeltaldhA DeltaackA DeltapflB Delta adhE DeltapdhR ::pflBp6-aceEF-lpd DeltamgsA), could generate 4 NADH every glucose oxidized two acetyl-CoA glycolysis pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. However, EG03 lost ability anaerobic growth due lack NADH oxidation pathways. butanol pathway genes encode acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (thiL), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (hbd), crotonase (crt), butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (bcd, etfA, etfB), butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (adheII) cloned Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, expressed E. coli EG03, balanced NADH oxidation pathway established homobutanol fermentation (glucose => 4 NADH + 2 acetyl-CoA => butanol). strain able convert glucose butanol (1,254 mg l(-1)) anaerobic condition.
