 Unlike normal cells, cancer cells recently identified rely aerobic glycolysis energy production called Warburg effect. Several attempts made target metabolic reprogramming pathway treating cancers; however, successful rate limited. study, investigated functional roles fatty acid oxidation key enzyme carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a (CPT-1a), metabolic programming pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells induced glucose deprivation. Knockdown CPT-1a decreased intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) glutathione (GSH) generation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, induced sensitivity glucose deprivation, whereas upregulation CPT-1a increased intracellular ATP required cell survival. investigation showed CPT-1a inhibitor etomoxir (ETO) restore sensitivity PDAC cells gemcitabine regress xenograft tumors vivo. Finally, overexpression CPT-1a expression associated chemoresistance tumor specimens. data suggest CPT-1a plays key role reprogramming cancer metabolism escape energy stress.
