 Bioassay-guided fractionation fermentation broth Arctic Streptomyces nitrosporeus YBH10-5 resulted isolation seven new compounds named nitrosporeunols A-G (1-7), together seven known analogues (8-14). structures determined based extensive spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1-14 evaluated lowering lipid effects, two compounds (10 12) remarkably decreased lipid levels including total cholesterol (TC) triglycerides (TG) HepG2 cells. Quantitative realtime PCR Western blot indicated farnesylquinone (12) increased expression key proteins including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), well downstream genes carnitine palmitoyltransterase-1 (CPT-1), acyl-coenzyme oxidase 1 (ACOX), malonyl CoA decarboxylase 1 (MCD1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), cholesterol 7alpha -hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Luciferase assay showed 12 increased transcriptional activity PPARalpha, lipid-lowering effect abolished PPARalpha inhibitor, MK886, HepG2 cells. findings suggested 12 potent lipid-lowering agent may decrease lipid levels upregulation PPARalpha pathway.
