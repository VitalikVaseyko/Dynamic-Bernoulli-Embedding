 c-MYC hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) critical factors tumorigenesis large number human cancers. normal function MYC involves induction cell proliferation enhancement cellular metabolism, function HIF, particularly HIF-1, involves adaptation hypoxic microenvironment, including activation anaerobic glycolysis. MYC-dependent tumors grow, hypoxic tumor microenvironment elevates levels HIF, oncogenic MYC HIF collaborate enhance cancer cell's metabolic needs increased uptake glucose conversion lactate. HIF also able attenuate mitochondrial respiration induction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), part accounts Warburg effect describes propensity cancers avidly take glucose convert lactate concurrent decrease mitochondrial respiration. Target genes common HIF MYC, PDK1, LDHA, HK2, TFRC, therefore attractive therapeutic targets, coordinate induction HIF MYC widens therapeutic window cancer normal tissues.
