 1. pancreatic islets exposed K(+)-free medium, intracellular concentration K(+) decreased Na(+) increased. 2. K(+)-deprived islets, utilization [5-(3)H]glucose, output lactic acid oxidation [U-(14)C]-glucose decreased 30-40% control values found normal extracellular K(+) concentration (5.0mm). However, oxidation [U-(14)C]pyruvate unaffected. 3. omission extracellular K(+) little affected production (14)CO(2) islets prelabelled [U-(14)C]palmitate incubated absence glucose, despite fact K(+) deprivation significantly increased ATP concentration ATP/ADP concentration ratio glucose-deprived islets. 4. normal K(+) concentration, glucose increased concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate, NAD(P)H ATP islets. glucose-stimulated islets, concentration phosphoenolpyruvate, either NAD(P)H ATP, higher absence presence extracellular K(+). islet homogenates, activity pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) stimulated K(+) (optimal activity 100-150mm-K(+)) inhibited Na(+) (except low K(+) concentrations). 5. K(+) could replaced NH(4) (+), Rb(+), Cs(+) Na(+) maintain, least extent, pyruvate kinase activity islet homogenates. Addition Rb(+) Cs(+), NH(4) (+), K(+)-deprived media also increased [U-(14)C]glucose oxidation intact islets. 6. omission K(+) cause obvious anomaly apparent dependency (45)Ca(2+) net uptake NAD(P)H concentration islets. 7. data suggest coupling metabolic ionic events islet cells involves feedback mechanisms glucose oxidation may modulated cationic factors.
