 1. Monospecific antiserum raised rabbits homogeneous cytosolic pyruvate kinase isolated 5-day-old germinating endosperm castor oil plant, Ricinus communis. earlier study demonstrated purified enzyme putatively heterotetrameric, composed two subunits migrate 57-kDa 56-kDa proteins upon sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [Plaxton, W. C. (1988) Plant Physiol. (Bethesda) 86, 1065-1069]. proteins detected Western blots extracts prepared denaturing conditions 4-8-day-old, 0-3-day-old, germinating-endosperm tissue. suggests subunits exist vivo, large increase pyruvate kinase activity occurs around fourth day germination due increase pyruvate kinase concentration. 2. cytosolic plastidic pyruvate kinase isozymes (termed PKc PKp, respectively) castor-oil-plant developing endosperm expanding leaf tissue separated anion-exchange chromatography Q-Sepharose. antigenic reaction partially purified enzyme preparations rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised homogeneous germinating-castor-bean PKc tested immunoprecipitation Western blotting. Although developing-endosperm leaf PKc appeared antigenically similar germinating-endosperm PKc, differed heterotetrameric germinating-endosperm enzyme composed single type subunit molecular mass 56 kDa. cross-reactivity PKc antibodies observed either developing-endosperm leaf PKp, rabbit muscle Bacillus stearothermophilus pyruvate kinase. Conversely, none castor-oil-plant pyruvate kinase preparations showed significant cross-reactivity antibodies raised purified yeast rabbit muscle pyruvate kinases. 3. investigate structural relationship two germinating-endosperm-PKc subunits, polypeptide characterized amino acid composition analysis peptide mapping CNBr fragmentation. amino acid compositions CNBr cleavage patterns two subunits similar, identical, suggesting polypeptides related, distinct, proteins. Mild tryptic attack native enzyme led approximate 6-kDa reduction apparent molecular mass subunits, indicating sequence similarity two polypeptides. 4. Native molecular masses various castor-oil-plant pyruvate kinases estimated Superose-6 gel-filtration chromatography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
