 Congenital insensitivity pain anhidrosis autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized recurrent episodic fever, anhidrosis (inability sweat), absence reaction noxious stimuli, self-mutilating behavior, mental retardation. human TRKA gene (NTRK1), located chromosome 1q21-q22 encodes receptor tyrosine kinase nerve growth factor. reported TRKA gene responsible CIPA developed comprehensive strategy screen TRKA mutations polymorphisms, based gene's structure organization. report eight novel mutations detected either homozygous heterozygous state nine CIPA families five countries. Mendelian inheritance mutations confirmed seven families samples either parent available. However, non-mendelian inheritance seems likely family samples mother siblings, (but father) available. paternal uniparental disomy chromosome 1 likely cause reduction homozygosity TRKA gene mutation family. Interestingly, Hispanic patient USA two autosomal genetic disorders, CIPA pyruvate kinase deficiency, whose genetic loci mapped closely linked chromosomal region. splice mutation missense mutation detected TRKA PKLR genes homozygous proband, respectively. Thus, concomitant occurrence two disorders ascribed combination two separate mutant genes, contiguous gene syndrome. finding suggests mechanism responsible two autosomal genetic disorders one patient. data support findings TRKA defects cause CIPA various ethnic groups. aid diagnosis genetic counseling painless severe genetic disorder.
