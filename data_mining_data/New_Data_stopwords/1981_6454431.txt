 Lymph-node cells (AKR X C3H) F1 leukaemic mice showed considerable increase glycolytic activity O2 consumption. glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, aldolase lactic acid dehydrogenase showed increased activities leukaemic conditions. Studies permeabilized leukaemic normal lymph-node cells, assays partially purified phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase enzymes, revealed enhanced glycolysis tumour cells due predominance glycolytic isoenzymes relatively insensitive natural metabolic inhibitors. glycolytic enzyme hexokinase showed decreased activity leukaemic conditions, owing subcellular translocation bulk cytosol mitochondrial fraction. Association hexokinase mitochondria accounted ATPase-like stimulatory action cell respiration explain increased O2 uptake leukaemic cells.
