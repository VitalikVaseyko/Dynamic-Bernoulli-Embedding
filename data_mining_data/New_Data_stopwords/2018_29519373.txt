 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase deficiency hereditary disease affects glycolytic pathway red blood cell, causing nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. disease transmitted autosomal recessive trait shows marked variability clinical expression. study reports molecular characterization ten Brazilian pyruvate kinase-deficient patients genotype-phenotype correlations. METHOD: Sanger sequencing silico analysis carried identify characterize genetic mutations. non-affected group Brazilian individuals also screened commonly reported variants (c.1456C>T c.1529G>A). RESULTS: Ten different variants identified PKLR gene, three reported first time: p.Leu61Gln, p.Ala137Val p.Ala428Thr. three missense variants involve conserved amino acids, providing rationale observed enzyme deficiency. allelic frequency c.1456C>T 0.1% 1529G>A variant found. CONCLUSION: first comprehensive report molecular characterization pyruvate kinase deficiency South America. results allowed us correlate severity clinical phenotype identified variants.
