 Acute chronic toxicity tests conducted sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) exposed heavy metals. Acute toxicity values (96 h LC50) 2.697, 0.133, 1.574 mg L(-1) Zn, Cu, Cd, respectively, ranked order toxicity: Cu > Cd > Zn. chronic metal exposure specific growth rates sea cucumbers decreased increase metal concentration three metals. acute metal exposure, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) decreased. OCRs groups significantly different control (P < 0.05) except group treated 1.00 mg L(-1) Zn (P < 0.05), increase OCR observed. OCRs groups chronically exposed metals significantly lower control group (P < 0.05). activity pyruvate kinase (PK) hexokinase (HK) sea cucumbers followed: respiratory tree > muscle > intestine natural sea water. chronic Zn, Cu, Cd exposure, change pattern HK PK respiratory tree, muscle, intestine varied slightly. However, activity enzyme showed general trend increase decrease higher exposure concentration was, earlier highest point enzyme activity obtained.
