 African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, ectothermic vertebrate survive low environmental temperatures. gain insight molecular events induced low body temperature, liver proteins evaluated standard laboratory rearing temperature (22 degrees C, control) low environmental temperature (5 degrees C, cold exposure). Using nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry, identified 58 proteins differed abundance. subsequent Gene Ontology analysis revealed tyrosine phenylalanine catabolic processes modulated cold exposure, resulted decreases hepatic tyrosine phenylalanine, respectively. Similarly, levels pyruvate kinase enolase, involved glycolysis glycogen synthesis, also decreased, whereas levels glycogen phosphorylase, participates glycogenolysis, increased. Therefore, measured metabolites respective pathways found levels hepatic glycogen glucose decreased. Although liver oxidative stress iron accumulation caused hepatic erythrocyte destruction, hepatic NADPH/NADP ratio changed. Thus, glycogen probably utilized mainly NADPH supply rather energy glucose production. conclusion, X. laevis responds low body temperature modulating hepatic proteome, results altered carbohydrate metabolism.
