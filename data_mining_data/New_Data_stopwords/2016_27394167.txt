 Cancer cells high rates glycolysis lactic acid fermentation order fuel accelerated rates cell division (Warburg effect). Here, present strategy merging cancer yeast metabolism remove pyruvate, key intermediate cancer cell metabolism, produce toxic compound acetaldehyde. approach achieved administering yeast enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase triple negative breast cancer cells. overcome challenges protein delivery, nanoparticle-based system consisting cationic lipids porous silicon employed obtain efficient intracellular uptake. results demonstrate enzyme therapy decreases cancer cell viability production acetaldehyde reduction lactic acid fermentation.
