 Positive response plant species plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria led increased interest use bacterial inoculants. However, introduction exogenous bacteria natural ecosystems may perturb bacterial populations within microbial community lead disruption indigenous populations performing key functional roles. study effect Azospirillum brasilense inoculation maize (Zea mays) rhizosphere Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, alpha-Proteobacteria, Pseudomonas Bdellovibrio spp. assessed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) approach conjunction group-specific primers. DGGE fingerprints analysis revealed introduction A. brasilense alter disrupt microbial system group-specific level. However, communities alpha-Proteobacteria Bdellovibrio influenced plant age bacterial groups remained unaffected. Based well previous data, inferred inoculation A. brasilense perturb natural bacterial populations investigated.
