 developed novel procedure isolation muscle isozymes aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), enolase, pyruvate kinase (PK) lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), also creatine kinase (CK), high purity, specific activity yield. Protein extracted chicken breast muscle glycolytic enzymes purified three step procedure consisting of: Ammonium sulfate combined pH fractionation. Phosphocellulose chromatography performance high pressure liquid chromatography, exploiting pH gradient formed gradient buffering ion protein elution. Affinity chromatography causing elution substrate pH. enzymes, obtained 95% purity judged specific activity silver stained electropherograms, injected sheep. Antibody enzyme purified specific immunosorbant specificity verified immunotransfer analysis.
