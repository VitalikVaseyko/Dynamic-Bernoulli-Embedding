 Vanadate insulin administered diabetic (streptozotocin) rats compare effects activity mRNA content 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase L-type pyruvate kinase liver. activity 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase livers diabetic rats 40% found normal rats. similar decrease found 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase content, measured immunoprecipitation, mRNA, measured hybridization Northern blots. Administration vanadate diabetic rats led progressive recovery 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose- 2,6-bisphosphatase content mRNA. recovery, complete 15 days oral treatment, also obtained 60 h insulin administration. L-type pyruvate kinase activity mRNA also decreased 70% livers diabetic rats. parameters normalized 15 days vanadate treatment, whereas insulin administration (60 h) raised L-pyruvate kinase mRNA three-fold control values. Oral treatment 15 days vanadate thus mimic effect insulin pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6- bisphosphatase livers diabetic rats.
