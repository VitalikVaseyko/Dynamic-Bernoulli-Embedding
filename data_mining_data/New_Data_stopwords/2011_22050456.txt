 present work, characterized proteomes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line PANC-1 normal pancreatic duct cells mass spectrometry using LTQ-Orbitrap identified 1700 proteins sample. basis spectra count label-free quantification approach, identified large number differentially expressed metabolic enzymes proteins involved cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, transport, transcription, translation, cell proliferation well. data demonstrated metabolic pathways altered PANC-1, consistent Warburg effect. addition, comparative MS analysis unveiled anomalous metabolism glutamine, suggesting glutamine largely consumed nitrogen donor nucleotide amino acid biosynthesis PANC-1. analysis provides potentially comprehensive picture metabolism PANC-1, may serve basis new diagnostics treatment PDAC.
