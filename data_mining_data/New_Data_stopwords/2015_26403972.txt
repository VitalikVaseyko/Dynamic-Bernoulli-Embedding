 Combining glycolytic inhibition anti-cancer therapies potential approach treating cancer. context, attempted identify genes determine sensitivity 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), glycolytic inhibitor, cancer cells using pooled shRNA libraries targeting approximately 15,000 genes. screen revealed COPB1 ARCN1, essential retrograde transport, determinants sensitivity 2DG: silencing COPB1 ARCN1 expression sensitized cells 2DG toxicity. address mechanism potentiation 2DG toxicity inhibition COPI-mediated transport, focused role lipolysis alternate source energy upon inhibition glycolysis. process lipolysis, COPI-mediated transport required localization lipid droplets adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), key enzyme produces fatty acids triacylglycerol substrate beta-oxidation. ATGL inhibitor atglistatin potentiated 2DG toxicity, consistent model defect COPI-mediated transport ATGL lipid droplets inhibits energy supply, thereby sensitizing cells glycolytic inhibition. Collectively, data demonstrated defect COPI-mediated transport pharmacological inhibition ATGL potentiates 2DG toxicity cancer cells, possibly due reduction energy supply.
