 study presents data comparing new tumor marker Tumor M2-PK CEA, CYFRA 21-1, NSE SCC diagnosis lung cancer. Tumor M2-PK quantitatively detectable EDTA-plasma sensitive ELISA. results tumor marker test compared respect different histological tumor types tumor staging. far 144 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients included. Significantly elevated tumor marker concentrations found progressive tumor stages. best correlation tumor stage observed Tumor M2-PK CYFRA 21-1. Comparison sensitivities detection lung cancer indicated Tumor M2-PK-test (sensitivity: 58%) efficient CEA-Test (sensitivity: 39%) CYFRA 21-1 (sensitivity: 48%). Generally higher sensitivity non-small cell lung cancer shown Tumor M2-PK (sensitivity: 65%), CEA (sensitivity: 42%) CYFRA 21-1 (sensitivity: 58%). small-cell lung cancer marker NSE sensitive markers. Initial follow-up studies indicate Tumor M2-PK CYFRA 21-1 used monitor disease tumor progression regression chemotherapy. present data indicated Tumor M2-PK could valuable tumor marker detection lung cancer.
