Cancer connected mitochondrial malfunction (the Warburg effect) suggesting disrupted physical mechanisms. addition decreased energy conversion nonutilized energy efflux, mitochondrial malfunction accompanied negative effects cell. Diminished proton space charge layer static electric field around outer membrane result lowered ordering level cellular water increased damping microtubule-based cellular elastoelectrical vibration states. changes manifest dip amplitude signal fundamental frequency nonlinear microwave oscillator-the core diagnostic device-when coupled investigated cancerous tissue via near-field. dip present case healthy tissue.
