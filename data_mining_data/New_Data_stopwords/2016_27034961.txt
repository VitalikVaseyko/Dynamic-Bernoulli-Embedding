 Paecilomyces hepiali fungus widely used Asian countries various potential pharmacological activities. present study aims evaluate antidiabetic antinephritic effects Paecilomyces hepiali mycelium water extract (PHC) diabetic rat, established eight-week high-fat diet administration followed one-week tail intravenous injection 25 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). four-week 0.12 g/kg metformin PHC doses 0.08, 0.4, 2.0 g/kg treatment, increment body weight, decrement plasma glucose, low levels total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol diabetic rats observed. PHC promotes glucose metabolism enhancing insulin, pyruvate kinase activity, increasing synthesis glycogen. PHC normalized disturbed levels superoxide dismutase, methane dicarboxylic aldehyde, glutathione peroxidase kidney. inhibitory effects levels interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha serum kidney revealed protection PHC diabetic nephropathy. Compared nontreated diabetic rats, four-week PHC treatment resulted decrement nuclear factor kappa B expression kidney. results show Paecilomyces hepiali possesses antidiabetic antinephritic effects related modulation nuclear factor kappa B activity.
