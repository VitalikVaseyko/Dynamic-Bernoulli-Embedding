 control glycolytic flux yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae studied using permeabilized cells. Cells harvested chemostat cultures and, removal cell wall, nystatin used permeabilize spheroplasts. method possible study performance regulation complete functional metabolic pathway single enzymatic step. results showed ATP strong negative effect glycolytic activity affecting several glycolytic enzymes. However, main targets ATP inhibition phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Phospofructokinase inhibited ATP concentrations starting 1-2 mM, pyruvate kinase required ATP levels 2.5 mM inhibition visible. ATP concentrations range measured nitrogen- glucose-limited cells cultivated chemostat cultures. potential candidates enzymes susceptible ATP inhibition included hexokinase enolase. ATP:ADP ratio, well trehalose-6-phosphate levels, seem influence glycolytic activity.
