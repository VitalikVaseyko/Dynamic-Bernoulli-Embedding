 PykF one two pyruvate kinases Escherichia coli K-12. lambdaP(L) convergently integrated chromosome MG1655 strain, downstream pykF, face-to-face native promoter. presence lambdacIts857, efficient pykF ts-silencing achieved 5'-terminus P(L)-originated antisense RNA (asRNA), consisting rrnG-AT sequence, converted elongation complexes RNA polymerase form resistant Rho-dependent transcription termination. pykF silencing detected following features: (a) impaired growth strain pykA also disrupted using ribose non-phosphotransferase system-transporting carbon source; (b) pattern reduced synthesis full-sized pykF mRNA, mediated reverse transcription PCR, (c) significant decrease PykF activity. advantages anti-terminated convergent transcription clearly manifested strains rho_a-terminator inserted specifically interrupt asRNA synthesis. likely, target gene silenced transcriptional interference due collisions converging RNA polymerases, although, strictly, role cis-asRNA effects could excluded. details mechanisms yet determined, anti-terminated convergent transcription promising new technique silencing target genes.
