 aim present study identify signaling mechanism(s) responsible modulation growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHSR1a)-associated Akt activity. Ghrelin leads activation Akt interplay distinct signaling mechanisms: early G(i/o) protein-dependent pathway late pathway mediated beta-arrestins. found Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1) essential molecule G(i/o) protein-dependent beta-arrestin-mediated pathways. specifically, role SHP-1 G(i/o) protein-dependent pathway demonstrated fact overexpression catalytically defective SHP-1 augments tyrosine phosphorylation PI3K regulatory subunit p85, leading increase phosphorylation cSrc phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, finally activating Akt. presence SHP-1 beta-arrestin-scaffolded complex attenuating effect cSrc Akt activities verified SHP-1 regulates G(i/o) protein-dependent pathway also beta-arrestin-mediated pathway. Assays performed preadipocyte adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells showed SHP-1 expression. According results HEK-GHSR1a cells, ghrelin stimulated SHP-1 phosphorylation 3T3-L1 cells. increase ghrelin-induced Akt activity enhanced small interfering RNA SHP-1 preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. results reproduced white adipose tissue obtained mice, SHP-1 exhibited higher expression omental subcutaneous tissue. Furthermore, pattern expression inverted mice fed high-fat diet, suggesting role SHP-1 controlling ghrelin sensitivity adipose tissue. Indeed, SHP-1 deficiency associated augmented ghrelin-evoked Akt phosphorylation omental tissue, well decreased phosphorylation overexpression SHP-1 subcutaneous tissue. findings showed novel role SHP-1 regulation Akt activity modulation ghrelin/GHSR1a system signaling.
