 Infertility lactating dairy cows explained partially metabolic state associated high milk production. hypothesis lactating nonlactating cows would differ endometrial placental transcriptomes early pregnancy (day 28 42) difference would explain predisposition lactating cows embryonic loss time. Cows either milked milked calving. Reproductive [endometrium (caruncular intercaruncular) placenta] liver tissues collected day 28, 35, 42 pregnancy. hypothesis rejected effect lactation mRNA abundance within reproductive tissues found. Large differences within liver demonstrated utility model test effect lactation tissue gene expression. Major changes gene expression reproductive tissues across time found. Greater activation transcriptome recruitment activation macrophages found endometrium placenta. Changes glucose metabolism day 28 42 included greater mRNA abundance rate-limiting genes gluconeogenesis intercaruncular endometrium evidence establishment aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) placenta. Temporal changes predicted controlled CSF1, PDGFB, TGFB1, JUN. Production nitric oxide reactive oxygen species macrophages identified mechanism promote angiogenesis endometrium. Reported differences pregnancy development lactating vs. nonlactating cows could explained systemic glucose availability conceptus appeared independent endometrial placental transcriptomes.
