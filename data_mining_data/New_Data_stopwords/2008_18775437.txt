 report X-ray structures pyruvate kinase Leishmania mexicana (LmPYK) trapped different conformations. These, together previously reported structure LmPYK inactive (T-state) conformation, allow comparisons three different conformers species pyruvate kinase (PYK). Four new site point mutants showing effects side-chain alteration subunit interfaces also enzymatically characterised. LmPYK tetramer crystals grown ammonium sulphate precipitant adopt active-like conformation, sulphate ions active effector sites. sulphates occupy positions similar phosphates ligands bound active (R-state) constitutively active (nonallosteric) PYKs several species, provide insight structural roles phosphates substrates effectors. Crystal soaking sulphate-free buffers found induce major conformational changes tetramer. particular, unwinding Aalpha6' helix inward hinge movement B domain coupled significant widening (4 A) tetramer caused lateral movement C domains. two new LmPYK structures activity studies site point mutations described article consistent developing picture allosteric activity localised changes protein flexibility govern distribution conformer families adopted tetramer active inactive states.
