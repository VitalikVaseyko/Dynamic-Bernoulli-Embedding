 search novel factors interact octamer element, immunoglobulin kappa light chain (V kappa) heavy chain VH) gene promoters compared binding nuclear proteins lymphoid cells. promoters showed similar pattern bound factors, entirely different seen human immunodeficiency virus, type promoter. Besides OTF-1 (Oct-1) OTF-2 (Oct-2), least three additional complexes observed. Two functionally analyzed: C1, slowly migrating complex, much abundant B cells non-lymphoid cells, C4, appeared ubiquitous distribution. determined several methods, protein(s) forming C1 complex bound V kappa gene site partially covers octamer element, whereas, surprisingly, VH gene region spanning TATA box transcriptional initiation site recognized. ubiquitous C4 complex analyzed light chain promoter. protein specifically bound site immediately 5' octamer. vitro transcription analysis, found C4 augments octamer-dependent transcription V kappa gene. activation required binding OTF-1/OTF-2, C4 could stimulate transcription itself, implying synergistic interaction. Due overlapping binding sites, effect C1 could clearly separated C4 effect. However, specific interaction C1 crucial control elements light chain heavy chain promoters strongly suggests functional role immunoglobulin gene transcription control.
