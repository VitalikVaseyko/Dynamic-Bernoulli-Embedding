 Due protection oncogenic proteins degradation enhancement glycolytic phosphometabolites synthetic processes, respectively, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) important proteins tumor growth. present study undertaken investigate susceptibility proteins encoding genes chemopreventive agent butyrate human colon cells. Matched tissue different transformation stages derived 20 individual colon cancer patients used experiments. results quantitative real-time PCR revealed moderate increase HSP90beta PKM2 mRNA colon tumors (P < 0.01) compared normal tissues without relation clinical parameters. expression pattern could confirmed PKM2 protein Western blot HSP90beta. culturing butyrate, amount PKM2 transcripts decreased three tissue types strongest effects observed tumors (median fold decrease 45%, P < 0.05). protein data reflected influence supposing gradual degradation rate due longer half-life PKM2. contrast, mRNA expression HSP90beta normal tissue found 1.38-fold increased butyrate (P < 0.05), corresponding protein level. HSP90beta expression adenomas tumors remained generally insensitive. malignant tissue, however, significant correlation found individual effects observed gene protein expression level. conclusion, present study identified PKM2 potential direct target butyrate neoplastic colon tissue, whereas HSP90beta none it.
