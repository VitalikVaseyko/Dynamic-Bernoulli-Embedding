 Metabolic homeostasis requires integration complex signaling networks which, deregulated, contribute metabolic syndrome related disorders. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) emerged key regulator signaling networks implicated metabolic diseases obesity type 2 diabetes. review, examine mechanisms regulate PTP1B-substrate interaction, enzymatic activity experimental approaches identify PTP1B substrates. highlight findings implicate PTP1B metabolic regulation. particular, insulin leptin signaling discussed well recently identified PTP1B substrates involved endoplasmic reticulum stress response, cell-cell communication, energy balance vesicle trafficking. summary, PTP1B exhibits exquisite substrate specificity outstanding pharmaceutical target obesity type 2 diabetes.
