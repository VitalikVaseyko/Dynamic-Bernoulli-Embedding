 Cancer cells exhibit altered metabolism characterized generation adenosine triphosphate glycolysis generation fatty acids de novo synthesis. majority genes involved pathways binding sites specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors promoters. Studies showing Sp transcription factors, particularly Sp1, involved regulation cancer cells hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, fatty acid synthase, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha reviewed. Glycolysis lipogenesis cancers also known stimulated constitutive activation PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Evidence presented notion Sp transcription factors may act concert Akt regulate abnormal metabolism cancer cells.
