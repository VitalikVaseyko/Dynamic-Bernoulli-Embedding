 Recent findings show exposure temozolomide (TMZ), DNA-damaging drug used treat glioblastoma (GBM), suppress conversion pyruvate lactate. understand mechanistic basis effect potential utility TMZ response biomarker, compared response isogenic GBM cell populations differing expression DNA repair protein methyltransferase (MGMT), TMZ-sensitivity determinant, exposure TMZ vitro vivo. Hyperpolarized [1-((13))C]-pyruvate-based MRI used monitor temporal effects pyruvate metabolism parallel DNA-damage responses tumor cell growth. TMZ exposure decreased conversion pyruvate lactate MGMT-deficient cells. effect coincided temporally TMZ-induced increases levels DNA-damage response protein pChk1. Changes pyruvate lactate conversion triggered TMZ preceded tumor growth suppression associated changes levels NADH lactate dehydrogenase activity tumors. Instead, associated TMZ-induced decrease expression activity pyruvate kinase PKM2, glycolytic enzyme indirectly controls pyruvate metabolism. PKM2 silencing decreased PK activity, intracellular lactate levels, conversion pyruvate lactate manner TMZ, Chk1 silencing blocked TMZ-induced decrease PKM2 expression. Overall, findings showed TMZ-induced DNA damage linked PKM2 changes pyruvate metabolism, changes exploited MRI methods early sensor TMZ therapeutic response.
