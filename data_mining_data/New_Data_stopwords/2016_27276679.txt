 Arsenic benzo[alpha]pyrene (B[a]P) common contaminants developing countries. Many studies investigated consequences arsenic and/or B[a]P-induced cellular transformation, including altered metabolism. present study, show that, addition elevated glycolysis, B[a]P/arsenic-induced transformation also stimulates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Proteomic data immunoblot studies demonstrated enzymatic activities, involved glycolysis OXPHOS, upregulated primary transformed rat lung epithelial cell (TLEC) culture, well subcloned TLEC cell lines (TMCs), indicating OXPHOS active still contributed energy production. LEC expression, glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) TCA cycle enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), revealed alternating cyclic pattern glycolysis OXPHOS cell transformation. also found expression levels hypoxia-inducible factor-1a consistent pattern glycolysis course transformation. Low doses ATP synthase inhibitor depleted endogenous ATP levels greater extent TLECs, compared parental LECs, indicating greater sensitivity B[a]P/arsenic-transformed cells ATP depletion. However, TLEC cells exhibited better survival hypoxia, possibly due induction anaerobic glycolysis. Collectively, data indicate B[a]P/arsenic-transformed cells maintain energy production upregulation glycolysis OXPHOS. Selective inhibition metabolic pathways may serve therapeutic option cancer therapy.
