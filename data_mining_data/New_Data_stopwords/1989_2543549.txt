 present studies designed clarify contribution liver development hyperglycemia Wistar fatty rats. hepatic activities insulin-inducible enzymes involved glycolysis (glucokinase; GK pyruvate kinase) lipogenesis (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), higher fatty rats lean rats 4 8 weeks age higher insulin levels former. Thereafter, GK activities fatty rats decreased slightly spite severe hyperinsulinemia, differ lean rats. addition, fatty rats higher levels insulin-suppressible gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase. findings indicate hepatic enzymes fatty rats resistant insulin. postulation supported fact hepatic enzyme activities fatty rats showed lower response changes plasma insulin levels produced fasting refeeding. G6Pase/GK ratio, indicates net glucose handling liver, increased fatty rats decreased lean rats advancing age, suggesting hepatic glucose production fatty rats becomes dominant advancing age. changes hepatic glycolytic intermediates supported suggestion; glycolytic steps glucose glucose-6-phosphate phospho-enolpyruvate pyruvate fatty rats accelerated 5 weeks age, suppressed 12 weeks age. results indicate insulin resistance hepatic enzyme regulation may contribute development hyperglycemia Wistar fatty rats.
