 Muscle ATP turnover, glycogenolytic, glycolytic rates estimated compare energy cost glycolytic regulation 102.4 continuous intermittent stimulation. Quadriceps femoris muscles male subjects stimulated 20 Hz one continuous contraction (n = 6) series 64 contractions (1.6 on, 1.6 off; n = 6). Leg blood flow occluded muscle biopsies obtained rest following 51.2 102.4 contraction time conditions. Isometric force production activated knee extensors decreased 55% initial contraction force intermittent 80% initial contraction force continuous stimulation following 51.2 contraction time. Corresponding ATP turnover rates 4.49 +/- 0.39 3.80 +/- 0.44 mmol.kg dry muscle-1.s-1. normalized tension production respective energy costs intermittent continuous contractions 3.66 +/- 0.47 2.64 +/- 0.36 mmol ATP.kg-1.100 N-1. Glycogenolytic rates identical first 51.2 stimulation glycolysis higher intermittent group (1.05 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.11 mmol.kg-1.s-1). suggest increased ATP utilization intermittent contractions associated enhanced Ca2+-transport ATPase activity relaxation enhanced actomyosin ATPase activity early portion contraction. Glycolytic rate dependent ATP demand regulated allosteric modulators phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase released consumed reactions associated contraction.
