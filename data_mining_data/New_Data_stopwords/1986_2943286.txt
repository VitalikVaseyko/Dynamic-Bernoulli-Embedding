 effects different cerebro-protective agents selected key enzymes energy metabolism rat primary glial cultures rat cerebral cortex studied. indicators capacity important pathways energy metabolism following enzyme activities determined: hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-P-DH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), cytochrome-c-reductase (CCR). one week growth period, rat glial cultures incubated 3 4 weeks substances tested. Bencyclane (5 X 10(-5) mol/l) increased activities HK, G-6-P-DH, LDH, whereas PFK CCR reduced. Pyritinol (10(-4) mol/l) led higher G-6-P-DH activity, simultaneously lowering values PFK, CCR, PK, LDH, MDH. influence extract leaves Ginkgo bilobae (EGB; 100 mg/l) PFK, LDH, MDH activities reduced. alterations enzyme activities went along simultaneous reductions protein content, therefore allowing exclude toxic effects regard doses used. Moreover, direct interference analytical procedure demonstrable bencyclane EGB. Piracetam (10(-3) mol/l), flunarizine (10(-6) mol/l), dihydroergocristine (5 X 10(-6) mol/l), nicergoline (5 X 10(-6) mol/l) failed induce alteration employed doses. striking effects obtained meclofenoxate tested 10(-3) 10(-4) mol/l. higher dose caused elevation HK, PFK, CCR, G-6-P-DH, GDH MDH activities, slightly reducing PK. lower dose meclofenoxate CCR G-6-P-DH activities increased. Short-term incubation cultures 10(-3) mol/l meclofenoxate 24 hr led increase LDH, G-6-P-DH, GDH activities. Chronic incubation meclofenoxate (10(-3) mol/l) followed 48 hr deprivation drug resulted elevated HK, PFK, CCR, G-6-P-DH, GDH, MDH activities. changes accompanied alterations related metabolite levels. include elevations concentration creatine phosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, whereas glucose-6-phosphate levels reduced. one week meclofenoxate deprivation activities CCR G-6-P-DH still elevated. metabolites meclofenoxate dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE; 10(-3) mol/l) p-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (10(-3) mol/l) also investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
