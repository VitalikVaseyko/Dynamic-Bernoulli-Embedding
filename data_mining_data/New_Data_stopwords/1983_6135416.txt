 1. effects intragastric glucose feeding L-tri-iodothyronine (T3) administration rates hepatic brown-fat lipogenesis vivo examined fed 48 h-starved rats. 2. T3 treatment increased hepatic lipogenesis fed starved animals. Brown-fat lipogenesis unaffected slightly decreased T3 treatment fed starved rats. 3. Intragastric glucose feeding increased hepatic lipogenesis control T3-treated fed rats, increase hepatic lipogenesis starved control rats. Glucose feeding increased hepatic lipogenesis starved rats treated T3. Glucose feeding increased rates brown-fat lipogenesis experimental groups. effects glucose feeding liver brown-fat lipogenesis mimicked insulin injection. 4. increase hepatic lipogenesis T3-treated 48 h-starved rats intragastric glucose feeding prevented short-term insulin deficiency, (-)-hydroxycitrate, inhibitor ATP citrate lyase. increase lipogenesis brown adipose tissue response glucose feeding inhibited short-term insulin deficiency (-)-hydroxycitrate. 5. results tend preclude pyruvate kinase acetyl-CoA carboxylase sites interaction insulin T3 regulation hepatic lipogenesis 48 h-starved rats. potential sites interaction discussed.
