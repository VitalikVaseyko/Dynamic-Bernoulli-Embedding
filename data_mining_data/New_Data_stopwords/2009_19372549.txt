 aimed gain understanding molecular mechanisms involved oxaliplatin resistance colorectal cancer using proteomic approach. 5-fold oxaliplatin-resistant cell line, HTOXAR3, compared parental cell line, HT29, using two-dimensional PAGE. Mass spectrometry, Western blot, real-time quantitative PCR confirmed down-regulation pyruvate kinase M2 (PK-M2) HTOXAR3 cells. panel eight colorectal cancer cell lines, found negative correlation oxaliplatin resistance PK-M2 mRNA levels (Spearman r=-0.846, P=0.008). Oxaliplatin exposure HT29 HTOXAR3 led PK-M2 mRNA up-regulation. PK-M2 mRNA levels measured real-time quantitative PCR 41 tumors treated oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil. Tumors lowest PK-M2 levels attained lowest response rates (20% versus 64.5%, P=0.026). High PK-M2 levels associated high p53 levels (P=0.032). conclusion, data provided clearly link PK-M2 expression oxaliplatin resistance mechanisms implicate PK-M2 predictive marker response patients oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer.
