 Aging characterized progressive loss cellular function integrity. thought driven stochastic molecular damage. However, genetic environmental maneuvers enhancing mitochondrial function inhibiting glycolysis extend lifespan promote healthy aging many species. post-fertile Caenorhabditis elegans, progressive decline phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase age, reciprocal increase pyruvate kinase shunt energy metabolism oxidative metabolism anaerobic glycolysis. reduces efficiency total energy generation. result, energy-dependent physical activity cellular functions decrease due unmatched energy demand supply. return, decrease physical activity accelerates metabolic shift, forming vicious cycle. metabolic event determinant aging, retarded caloric restriction counteract aging. review, summarize evidence supporting idea metabolic reprogramming driver aging. also suggest strategies test hypothesis.
