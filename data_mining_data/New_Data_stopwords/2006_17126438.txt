 Quinolinic acid (QA) found increased concentrations brain patients affected various common neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's Alzheimer's diseases. Considering neuropathology disorders recently attributed least part energy deficit, present study investigated vitro effect QA (0.1-100 microM) various parameters energy metabolism, glucose uptake, (14)CO(2) production lactate production, well activities respiratory chain complexes I-V, citric acid cycle (CAC) enzymes, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Na(+),K(+)-ATPase finally rate oxygen consumption brain 30-day-old rats. initially observed QA significantly increased glucose uptake (55%), whereas (14)CO(2) generation glucose, acetate citrate inhibited (up 60%). Furthermore, QA-induced increase brain glucose uptake prevented NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Complex II activity also inhibited (up 35%) QA, whereas activities respiratory chain complexes, CAC enzymes, CK Na(+),K(+)-ATPase affected acid. Furthermore, inhibition complex II activity fully prevented pre-incubating cortical homogenates catalase plus superoxide dismutase, indicating effect probably mediated reactive oxygen species. addition, lactate production also altered QA, contrast conversion pyruvate lactate catalyzed LDH, significantly decreased (17%) neurotoxin. also observed QA change state III, state IV respiratory control ratio presence glutamate/malate succinate, suggesting effect cellular respiration rather weak. data provide evidence QA provokes mild impairment brain energy metabolism vitro support view brain energy deficiency associated certain neurodegenerative disorders could solely endorsed QA accumulation.
