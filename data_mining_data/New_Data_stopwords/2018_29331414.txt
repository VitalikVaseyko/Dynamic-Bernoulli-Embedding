 Since disturbed metabolic conditions obesity diabetes critical determinants breast cancer progression therapeutic failure, aimed determine mechanism responsible pro-oncogenic effects. Using non-invasive, epithelial-like ERalpha-positive MCF-7 T47D human breast cancer cells found hyperglycaemia induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), key programme responsible development metastatic disease. demonstrated loss epithelial marker E-cadherin together increases mesenchymal markers vimentin, fibronectin transcription factor SLUG, together enhancement cell growth invasion. phenotypic changes observed cells grown fibronectin plated collagen. Analyzing metabolic parameters, found hyperglycaemia-induced, matrix-specific EMT promoted Warburg effect upregulating glucose uptake, lactate release specific glycolytic enzymes transporters. showed silencing fatty acid synthase (FASN) downstream ERalpha, showed previously mediate hyperglycaemia-induced chemoresistance cells, resulted suppression cell growth: however, also resulted dramatic enhancement cell invasion SLUG mRNA levels via novel caveolin-1-dependent mechanism.
