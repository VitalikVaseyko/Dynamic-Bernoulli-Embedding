 Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) lipogenic transcription factor thought involved development hepatic steatosis insulin resistance. Increased ChREBP expression liver results increased hepatic steatosis, isoform ChREBPbeta adipose tissue predict insulin sensitivity obese humans. ChREBP activated glucose, postulated composition diet would regulate ChREBP isoform expression metabolically relevant tissues. compared effects diets high complex carbohydrate, high fat, normal chow ChREBP expression metabolic parameters C57BL/6 mice. found diets high fat decrease ChREBP expression adipose tissue, isocaloric diets high carbohydrate effect. Interestingly, decrease adipose ChREBP associated increased inflammatory markers. animals high carbohydrate diet induced robust increase hepatic ChREBPbeta expression ( approximately 2-fold; p = 0.0002), little detectable change abundant ChREBPalpha transcript. change accompanied increased expression target genes liver pyruvate kinase (p<0.0001), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p = 0.0191) stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p = 0.0045). increase ChREBP expression associated increased hepatic steatosis, despite changes body weight body fat compared chow-fed mice. Unexpectedly, mice fed high carbohydrate diet displayed enhanced sensitivity exogenous insulin, despite mild glucose intolerance increased liver steatosis. summary, shown composition diet selectively regulate ChREBP isoform expression tissue specific manner. Furthermore, shown high complex carbohydrate diet selectively increases hepatic ChREBPbeta expression, associates hepatic steatosis insulin resistance. contrast, high fat diet reduces adipose ChREBP, associates inflammation insulin resistance.
