 glycolytic pathway considered potential drug target parasitic protozoan species Trypanosoma Leishmania. report design synthesis inhibitors targeted Trypanosoma brucei phosphofructokinase (PFK) Leishmania mexicana pyruvate kinase (PyK). Stepwise library synthesis inhibitor design rational starting point identified furanose sugar amino amides novel class inhibitors enzymes IC(50) values 23microM 26microM PFK PyK, respectively. Trypanocidal activity also showed potency low micromolar range confirms inhibitors promising candidates development towards design anti-trypanosomal drugs.
