 Several novel series compounds synthesized evaluated inhibitors methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pyruvate kinase (PK). PK identified highly interconnected essential 'hub' protein MRSA, structural features distinct human homologs makes novel antimicrobial target. Several MRSA PK inhibitors (including hydrazide 1) identified using silico screening combined enzyme assays found selective bacterial enzyme compared human PK isoforms. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies carried replacement hydrazide linker 3-atoms, 2-atoms 0-atom linkers led us discover potent compounds enzyme inhibiting activities low nanomolar range found effectively inhibit bacteria growth culture minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) low 1 mug/mL.
