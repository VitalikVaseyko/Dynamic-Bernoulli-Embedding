 Warburg effect well-known feature cancer-specific metabolism. previously reported role microRNA (miR)-145 tumor-suppressor human bladder cancer (BC) cells. study, reveal miR-145 decreases Warburg effect silencing KLF4 BC cells. expression levels miR-145 significantly lower clinical BC samples BC cell lines compared normal tissues HUC cells. Luciferase assay results showed miR-145 directly bound 3'UTR KLF4, shown overexpressed clinical BC samples using Western blot analysis immunohistochemistry. Remarkable growth inhibition apoptosis induced ectopic expression miR-145 gene silencing KLF4 (siR-KLF4). Also, Warburg effect-related genes PTBP1/PKMs regulated transfection BC cells miR-145 siR-KLF4. results thus indicate miR-145/KLF4/PTBP1/PKMs axis one critical pathways maintain Warburg effect BC carcinogenesis. MiR-145 perturbed Warburg effect suppressing KLF4/PTBP1/PKMs pathway BC cells, resulting significant cell growth inhibition.
