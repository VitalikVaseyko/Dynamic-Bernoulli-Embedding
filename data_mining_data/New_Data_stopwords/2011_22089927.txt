 Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) deregulation contributes Warburg effect. HIF consists unstable alpha subunit stable beta subunit. presence oxygen, HIFalpha becomes prolyl hydroxylated members EglN (also called PHD) family, leading proteasomal degradation. hypoxic conditions, EglN activity diminished HIF levels rise. EglN1 primary HIF prolyl hydroxylase EglN2 EglN3 playing compensatory roles certain conditions. EglN2 EglN3 also appear play HIF-independent roles regulating cell proliferation apoptosis, respectively. EglNs belong large family 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases includes TET DNA hydroxymethylases JmjC-containing histone demethylases. Members superfamily inhibited endogenous metabolites, including fumarate succinate, accumulate tumors fumarate hydratase (FH) succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations, respectively, well 2-hydroxyglutarate detected isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant tumors. 2-Oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases therefore provide link altered metabolism cancer.
