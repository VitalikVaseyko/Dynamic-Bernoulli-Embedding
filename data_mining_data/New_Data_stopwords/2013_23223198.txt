 Foamy virus (FV) vectors shown great promise hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy. ability efficiently deliver transgenes multi-lineage long-term repopulating cells large animal models suggests effective several human hematopoietic diseases. Here, review FV vector studies large animal models, including use FV vectors mutant O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, MGMTP140K increase number genetically modified cells transplantation. studies, FV vectors mediated efficient gene transfer polyclonal repopulating cells using short ex vivo transduction protocols designed minimize negative effects ex vivo culture stem cell engraftment. regard, FV vectors appear superior gammaretroviral vectors, require longer ex vivo culture effect efficient transduction. FV vectors also compared favorably lentiviral vectors directly compared dog model. FV vectors corrected leukocyte adhesion deficiency pyruvate kinase deficiency dog large animal model. FV vectors also appear safer gammaretroviral vectors based reduced frequency integrants near promoters also near proto-oncogenes canine repopulating cells. Together, studies suggest FV vectors highly effective several human hematopoietic diseases, including require relatively high percentages gene-modified cells achieve clinical benefit.
