 Synthesis storage thyroid hormone precursor, thyroglobulin (TG), occurs within follicular lumen thyroid TG absorbed cells processing release blood. However, mechanism energy metabolism follicular lumen thyroid remains unknown. present study, three dimensional structure thyroid follicles constructed using primary culture swine cells follicular protein identified via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight mass spectrometry. Three glycolysis-associated enzymes, enolase, pyruvate kinase phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase identified addition TG. results support hypothesis anaerobic glycolysis glucose exists follicle supports energy consumption hormone synthesis.
