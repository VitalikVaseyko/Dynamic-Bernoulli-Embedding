 Cyclooxygenase-1 -2 (COX-1/2) catalyze initial step formation prostaglandins. recently role carcinogenesis become evident. influence apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, play key role production carcinogens. Usually, high level COX-2 expression found cancer cells. Large epidemiological trials studying users non-users aspirin shown cyclooxygenase inhibitors non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could benefit development growth malignancies. Moreover, clinical trials patients familial adenomatosis polyposis syndrome shown efficacy selective COX-2 inhibitors reduction number size colorectal polyps. Several preclinical studies show promising results combinatorial treatments either chemotherapy radiotherapy COX inhibitors. Preclinical studies simultaneous use inhibitors epidermal growth factor receptor COX-2 inhibitors shown also promising results. Encouraging results first clinical trials combining chemotherapy COX-2 inhibitors patients cancer advanced neoadjuvant setting recently reported. Thus, appears targeting COX-2 pathway promising strategy prevention treatment solid tumors.
