 Genotypically different host specific pathotypes Bursaphelenchus xylophilus identified. pathotypes elicit different responses pines depending susceptibility, tolerance, resistance. Continued passage pathotypes fungal cultures leads conversion nonparasitic populations. populations metabolize carbon substrates ethanol anaerobic pathway, operating level phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-succinate pathway excrete succinate-lactate malate. hand, parasitic populations metabolize glucose lactate-succinate, mainly PEP-succinate pathway, maintain redox balance glycerol production. Ethanol malate excreted parasitic populations.
