 Melanoma development involves members AGC kinase family, including AKT, PKC, and, recently, PDK1, elucidated recently studies Braf::Pten mutant melanomas. Here, report PDK1 contributes functionally skin pigmentation development melanomas harboring wild-type PTEN genotype, occurs 70% human melanomas. PDK1 substrate SGK3 determined important mediator PDK1 activities melanoma cells. Genetic pharmacologic inhibition PDK1 SGK3 attenuated melanoma growth inducing G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. synthetic lethal screen, pan-PI3K inhibition synergized PDK1 inhibition suppress melanoma growth, suggesting focused blockade PDK1/PI3K signaling might offer new therapeutic modality wild-type PTEN tumors. also noted responsiveness PDK1 inhibition associated decreased expression pigmentation genes increased expression cytokines inflammatory genes, suggesting method stratify patients melanoma PDK1-based therapies. Overall, work highlights potential significance PDK1 therapeutic target improve melanoma treatment.
