 carbon sources changed, Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional patterns drastically change. identify genes whose transcription used quantitatively measure sugar concentrations, searched genomic expression databases set genes highly induced diauxic shift, used promoters genes drive expression green fluorescent protein (GFP). Certain sugars, including glucose, fructose, mannose, repress promoter JEN1, encodes lactate-pyruvate transporter, dose-dependent manner. Nonrepressing carbon sources include galactose, raffinose, ethanol, lactate, glycerol. JEN1 promoter activity linear function glucose concentration organisms grown steady-state glucose concentration 1 g/liter. JEN1 promoter repression specific carbon source; heat cold shock, osmotic stress, DNA damage, nitrogen starvation significantly affect promoter activity. Activation JEN1 promoter requires Snf1 protein kinase, multiple regulatory elements likely combine provide linear relationship JEN1 promoter activity sugar concentration. Thus, JEN1 promoter-reporter system appears provide good living cell biosensor concentration certain sugars. JEN1 promoter also permits quantitative regulation cellular functions normally controlled sugar concentrations. example, strain expressing FLO1 control JEN1 promoter flocculates low glucose concentration.
