 target size four soluble enzymes (beta-galactosidase, pyruvate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) presence absence subcellular membrane fractions determined radiation-inactivation method using samples frozen state. four enzymes, full activity recovered freezing thawing absence radiation. found minimal (less 20%) binding enzymes either submitochondrial vesicles sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. conditions tested, beta-galactosidase, pyruvate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase exhibited target sizes varied according experimental conditions, i.e., buffer selected also presence absence membrane preparations. tetrameric enzymes, target sizes generally comparable either monomer dimer. contrast, target size glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Leuconostoc mesenteroides found essentially invariant frozen variety buffers presence absence either cryoprotectant (sucrose glycerol) different membrane preparations. target size 19 separate determinations gave average value 104 +/- 16 kDa, comparable molecular weight enzyme (104 kDa). conclude glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase L. mesenteroides reliable internal standard radiation-inactivation studies membrane preparations frozen state.
