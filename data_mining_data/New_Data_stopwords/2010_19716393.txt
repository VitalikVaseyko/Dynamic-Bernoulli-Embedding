 Cancer cells characterized self-sufficiency absence growth signals, ability evade apoptosis, resistance anti-growth signals, sustained angiogenesis, uncontrolled proliferation, invasion metastasis. Alterations cellular bioenergetics emerging hallmark cancer. mitochondrion major organelle implicated cellular bioenergetic biosynthetic changes accompanying cancer. bioenergetic modifications contribute invasive, metastatic adaptive properties typical tumors. Moreover, mitochondrial DNA mutations complement bioenergetic changes cancer. Several cancer management therapies proposed target tumor cell metabolism mitochondria. Glycolytic inhibitors serve classical example cancer metabolism targeting agents. Several TCA cycle OXPHOS inhibitors tested anticancer potential. Moreover, agents targeting PDC/PDK (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex/pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) interaction studied reversal Warburg effect. Targeting apoptotic regulatory machinery mitochondria another potential anticancer field need exploration. Additionally, oxidative phosphorylation uncouplers, potassium channel modulators, mitochondrial redox investigation anticancer potential. end increased demand agents specifically hit target. Delocalized lipophilic cations shown tremendous potential delivering anticancer agents selectively tumor cells. review provides overview potential anticancer agents act targeting cancer cell metabolism mitochondria, also brings us face face emerging opportunities cancer therapy.
