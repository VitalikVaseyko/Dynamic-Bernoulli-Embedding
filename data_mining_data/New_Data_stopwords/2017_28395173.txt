 Apart potent antioxidant property, recent studies revealed melatonin promotes PI3K/Akt phosphorylation following focal cerebral ischemia (FCI) mice. However, clear (i) whether increased PI3K/Akt phosphorylation concomitant event directly contributes melatonin's neuroprotective effect, (ii) melatonin regulates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway FCI. study, showed Akt intensively phosphorylated Thr308 activation loop compared Ser473 melatonin FCI. Melatonin treatment reduced infarct volume, reversed PI3K/Akt inhibition. However, PI3K/Akt inhibition inhibit melatonin's positive effect brain swelling IgG extravasation. Additionally, phosphorylation mTOR, PTEN, AMPKalpha, PDK1 RSK1 increased, phosphorylation 4E-BP1, GSK-3alpha/beta, S6 ribosomal protein decreased melatonin treated animals. addition, melatonin decreased apoptosis reduced p53 phosphorylation PI3K/Akt pathway. conclusion, demonstrated activation profiles PI3K/Akt signaling pathway components pathophysiological aspect ischemic stroke melatonin's neuroprotective activity. data suggest Akt phosphorylation, preferably Thr308 site activation loop via PDK1 PTEN, mediates melatonin's neuroprotective activity increased Akt phosphorylation leads reduced apoptosis.
