 Phosphocreatine production ctalyzed cytosolic fraction cardiac muscle containing glycolytic enzymes creatine kinase soluble form studied presence creatine, adenine nucleotides different glycolytic intermedites substrates. Glycolytic depletion glucose, fructose 1,6bis(phosphate) phosphoenolpyruvate lactte coupled efficient phosphocreatine production. molar ratio phosphocreatine lactate produced close 2.0 fructose 1,6bis(phosphate) used substrate 1.0 phosphoenolpyruvate. processes creatine kinase reaction rate-limiting step: themass action ratio creatine kinase reaction close equilibrium value maximal rate forward creatine kinase reaction exceeded glycolytic flux 6-fold fructose 1,6-bis(phosphate) used substrate. Therefore, creatine kinase raction continuously state quasi-equilibrium efficient syntheses phosphocreatine observed result constant removal ADP glycolytic system almost unchanged level ATP ([ATP]>>[ADP]), leading continuous shift creatine kinase equilibrium position. phosphocreatine added initially concentrations 5---15 mM rate coupled creatine kinase glycolytic reactions significantly inhibited due sharp decrease steady-state concentration ADP. Therefore, conditions effective phosphocreatine production heart mitochondria, maintain high phosphocreatine: creatine ratio myoplasm vivo, glycolytic flux may suppressed due limited availability ADP restricted creatine kinase system. possible physiological role control glycolytic flux creatine kinase system discussed.
