 Buoyant density centrifugation discontinuous gradients separates red blood cells (RBCs) according age, shown radiolabelling experiments vitro vivo. Changes observed gradients reflect vivo rates decline. progressive metabolic decline may render RBC incapable surviving stresses circulation. hypothesized changes take place reticulocyte-mature RBC transition. RBC hexokinase (HK) two isozymes, one predominant reticulocytes, mature RBCs. compared decline density gradient, pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase (P5N), glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) pyruvate kinase (PK). decline HK P5N clearly biphasic; GOT PK instead single slope. Thus changes taking place reticulocyte-RBC transition clearly identified biphasic slope gradient. view progressive metabolic decline vivo RBC therefore remains valid.
