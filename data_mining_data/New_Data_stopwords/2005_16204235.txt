 Transcription hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene cell type-specific control various nutritional conditions. L-PK gene contains multiple cis-regulatory elements located within 170-bp upstream region necessary regulations. elements synergistically stimulate L-PK gene transcription, although mechanisms largely unknown. nuclear factor (NF) 1 family members bind specific cis-regulatory elements known L-IIA L-IIB hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha binds adjacent element L-I, examined functional physical interactions two transcription factors. Reporter gene assay showed two factors synergistically activated L-PK promoter containing 5'-flanking region -189. Although two NF1-binding sites required maximum synergistic effect NF1 family members HNF1alpha, significant functional interaction two factors observed L-PK promoter containing two mutated NF1-binding sites also promoter containing HNF1alpha-binding site, raising possibility NF1 proteins function HNF1alpha co-activators. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed NF1 proteins HNF1alpha bound promoter region L-PK gene vivo. vitro binding assay confirmed NF1 proteins directly interacted mainly homeodomain HNF1alpha via DNA-binding domains. interaction enhanced HNF1alpha binding L-I element also observed rat liver co-immunoprecipitation assay. Thus, conclude cooperative interaction NF1 family members HNF1alpha plays important role hepatic L-PK transcription.
