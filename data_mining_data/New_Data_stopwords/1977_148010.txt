 Three control point enzymes Embden-Meyerhof pathway, hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK) measured quantitative histochemical methods individual hypothalamic nuclei adult neonatally androgenized female rats. HK activity significantly increased anterior hypothalamic nuclei: medial preoptic, lateral preoptic, suprachiasmatic. PK significantly elevated lateral preoptic suprachiasmatic nuclei anterior hypothalamus also medial mamillary nucleus median eminence. significant changes occurred PFK activity.
