 Enzymopathies pyruvate kinase caused defects structural genes forming stable unstable mutants, respectively. Stable mutants PK characterized high S0,5 PEP nearly unchanged Vmax. decrease PEP affinity result high allosteric constant L0 increased KPEP. pattern PAGE concluded stable PK mutants tetraheteromers composed two normal two shortened polypeptide chains. suppose result mutation codon stops polypeptide synthesis PK earlier. PK mutants unstable. characterized low catalytic activity high PEP affinity. kinetic properties unstable mutants changed posttranslational proteolytic modifications. Furthermore low S0,5 PEP values result persistence isoenzyme PK-K reticulocytes erythrocytes, respectively. prenatal diagnosis PK enzymopathies carried small blood volume using method isoelectrophoretic focussing.
