 Although glycolysis substantially elevated many tumors, therapeutic targeting glycolysis cancer patients yet successful, potentially reflecting metabolic plasticity tumor cells. various cancer cells exposed continuous glycolytic block, identified recurrent reprogramming mechanism involving sustained mTORC1 signaling underlies escape glycolytic addiction. Active mTORC1 directs increased glucose flux via pentose phosphate pathway back glycolysis, thereby circumventing glycolysis block ensuring adequate ATP biomass production. Combined inhibition glycolysis mTORC1 signaling disrupted metabolic reprogramming tumor cells inhibited growth vitro vivo. findings reveal novel combinatorial therapeutic strategies realize potential benefit targeting Warburg effect.
