 design synthesis alternative nucleoside triphosphate substrates DNA RNA polymerases holds continued promise create biochemical probes precursors synthesis nucleic acid mimics. azole carboxamide nucleotides particular interest, display multiple conformations context DNA replication. efficient chemoenzymatic preparation azole carboxamide deoxyribo- ribonucleoside triphosphates presented. Nucleoside diphosphate prepared nucleoside 5'-O-tosylate displacement tris(tetra-n-butylammonium) pyrophosphate. Enzymatic phosphorylation azole carboxamide deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate triphosphate based ATP phosphate donor nucleoside diphosphate kinase catalyst, coupled phospho(enol)pyruvate (PEP) pyruvate kinase ATP regeneration system. Enzymatic phosphorylation azole carboxamide ribonucleoside diphosphate requires PEP phosphate donor pyruvate kinase catalyst. optimized purification uses boronate affinity gel yield highly purified nucleoside triphosphate.
