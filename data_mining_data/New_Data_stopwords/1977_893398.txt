 Pyruvate kinase type purified pig kidney yield 9%. final enzyme fraction specific activity 500 units/mg protein. enzyme appeared homogeneous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detergent ultracentrifugation experiments. molecular weight enzyme found 210,000 use ultracentrifugation 249,000 gel chromatography. sedimentation coefficient (S degrees 20, w) calculated 9.8 S. reduced alkylated pyruvate kinase, molecular weight 60,000 found use several methods. Stokes radius enzyme calculated 56 A. NH2-terminal amino acid detected enzyme, findings carbohydrate analyses kidney pyruvate kinase trace amounts glucose. isoelectric point enzyme estimated pH 5.6. Pig kidney pyruvate kinase type phosphorylated incubation ATP cyclic 3':5'-AMP-dependent protein kinase. amino acid compositions pig kidney pig muscle pyruvate kinases similar differed clearly pig liver pyruvate kinase.
