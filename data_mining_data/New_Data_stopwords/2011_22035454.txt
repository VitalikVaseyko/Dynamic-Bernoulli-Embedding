 wide variety nanoparticle platforms developed diagnosis treatment malignancy. many passively targeted rely receptor-ligand interactions, metabolically directed nanoparticles provide complementary approach. known primary secondary events tumorigenesis alter metabolic profile developing metastatic cancers. One highly conserved metabolic phenotype state up-regulated glycolysis reduced use oxidative phosphorylation, even oxygen tension limiting. metabolic shift, termed Warburg effect, creates "hostile" tumor microenvironment increased levels lactic acid low extracellular pH. order exploit phenomenon improve delivery nanoparticle platforms wide variety tumors, pH-responsive iron oxide nanoparticle designed. Specifically, glycol chitosan (GC), water-soluble polymer pH-titratable charge, conjugated surface superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) generate T(2)*-weighted MR contrast agent responds alterations surrounding pH. Compared control nanoparticles lack pH sensitivity, GC-SPIO nanoparticles demonstrated potent pH-dependent cellular association MR contrast vitro. murine tumor models, GC-SPIO also generated robust T(2)*-weighted contrast, correlated increased delivery agent tumor site, measured quantitatively inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Importantly, increased delivery GC-SPIO nanoparticles cannot solely attributed commonly observed enhanced permeability retention effect since nanoparticles similar physical properties blood circulation times control agents.
