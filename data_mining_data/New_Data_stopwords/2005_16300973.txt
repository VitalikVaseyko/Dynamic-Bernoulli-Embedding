 investigated mechanisms nitric oxide (NO) donor (DETA/NO) regulates proliferation pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. donor stimulated proliferation low concentrations, reversibly completely inhibited proliferation higher concentrations. stimulation (but inhibition) proliferation apparently due stimulation soluble guanylate cyclase produce cGMP, prevented specific cyclase inhibitor (ODQ), replicated cell-permeable form cGMP. NO-induced cytostasis reversed inhibitors MEK kinase poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, treatments bypass inhibition ribonucleotide reductase ornithine decarboxylase. Cytostatic concentrations DETA/NO strongly inhibited respiration PC12 cells, specific respiratory inhibitors (rotenone, myxothiazol, azide) caused complete cytostasis. Uridine pyruvate reversed cytostasis induced specific respiratory inhibitors, induced DETA/NO. However, combination uridine, pyruvate, N-acetyl-cysteine reverse DETA/NO-induced cytostasis. DETA/NO strongly progressively inhibited glycolysis measured glucose consumption, lactate production, ATP level, specific glycolytic inhibitor (5 mM 2-deoxy-d-glucose) caused complete cytostasis. results indicate low concentrations increases cell proliferation via cGMP, high concentrations block proliferation via inhibition glycolysis respiration, causing energy depletion.
