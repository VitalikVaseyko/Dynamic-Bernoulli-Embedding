 Structural functional characteristics rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK), tetrameric enzyme identical subunits, investigated neutral well acidic conditions using enzymatic activity measurements combination optical methods, circular dichroism, fluorescence, ANS binding. low pH low ionic strength, pyruvate kinase exists partially unfolded state (UA state) retaining half secondary structure tertiary interactions along strong binding hydrophobic dye, ANS. Addition anions, like NaCl, KCl, Na2SO4, acid-unfolded state induces refolding, resulting structural propensities similar native tetramer. anion concentration exceeds critical limit (0.7 KCl), sudden loss secondary structure decrease fluorescence intensity redshift emission maximum seen may due aggregation protein, probably due intermolecular association. anion-refolded state stable UA state, stability nearly equal native protein toward chemical-induced unfolding Gu-HCl urea. Moreover, low concentrations, Gu-HCl behaves like anion, inducing refolding acid-unfolded state structural features equivalent native molecule. observations support model protein folding certain conformations low free energy prevail populated non-native conditions different stability.
