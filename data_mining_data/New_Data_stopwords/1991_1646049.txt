 Adenylate kinase (AK) modulates interconversion adenine nucleotides (AMP + adenosine triphosphate----2 ADP). evaluated fifth kindred hereditary erythrocyte (RBC) AK deficiency. proband chronic hemolytic anemia. RBC undetectable AK activity measured spectrophotometrically, whereas parents half-normal AK activity. AK electrophoresis showed AK-1 parents. activities pyruvate kinase phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase decreased given young age proband's RBC. Despite absence spectrophotometric AK activity, proband's RBC able incorporate 14C-adenine 14C-adenine nucleotides 50% rate expected young RBC population, suggesting possibility alternative pathway formation ADP AMP. Normal hemolysate AMP:guanosine triphosphate (GTP) phosphotransferase activity, produced ADP 8% 9% rate AK (6.8 +/- 0.8 IU/mL RBC). AMP:GTP phosphotransferase activity detectable proband's parent's hemolysates. additional biochemical defects AK-deficient RBC support concept AK deficiency per se may cause hemolytic anemia. propose defects occur multiple phosphotransferases AK-deficient RBC biochemical defects may produce deleterious lesions promote shortened RBC survival AK deficiency.
