 Akt key mediator cell proliferation, survival metabolism. translocation membrane phosphorylation T308 S473, activated Akt dissociates plasma membrane cytoplasm, important step phosphorylate downstream targets. addition central role regulating kinase activity, phosphorylation T308 kinase loop reported necessary dissociation process. However, clear whether membrane detachment requires mechanisms. present report, demonstrate membrane dissociation Akt requires phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) directly phosphorylates T308 also T34 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Like T308, T34 phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate- phosphatidylserine-dependent manner. Phosphorylation T34 also occurred cells following growth factor stimulation, concurrently T308 phosphorylation. Moreover, T34 mutated aspartic acid (T34D) mimic phosphorylation, Akt-membrane association assessed surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy significantly reduced. cells, mutation impaired IGF-induced Akt membrane translocation subsequent phosphorylation T308 S473. Taken together, results demonstrate T34 phosphorylation PDK1 promotes membrane dissociation activated Akt downstream action attenuating membrane binding affinity. membrane dissociation mechanism offers new insight Akt activation process provides potential new target controlling Akt-dependent cellular processes.
