 electrostatic properties seven alpha/beta-barrel enzymes selected different evolutionary families studied: triose phosphate isomerase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, pyruvate kinase, mandelate racemase, trimethylamine dehydrogenase, glycolate oxidase, narbonin, protein without known enzymatic activity. backbone alpha/beta-barrel distinct electrostatic field pattern, dipolar along barrel axis. side chains included calculations general effect modulate electrostatic pattern electrostatic field generally enhanced focused specific area near active site. use electrostatic flux square surface near active site gauge functionally relevant magnitude electrostatic field. calculations reveal six seven cases backbone contributes greater 45% total flux. substantial electrostatic contribution backbone correlates known preference alpha/beta-barrel enzymes negatively charged substrates.
