 L-Phenylalanine allosteric inhibitor M1-type pyruvate kinase. Accordingly, effects studied 20 mM phenylalanine metabolism 5 mM [U-14C]glucose 3 mM L-[U-14C]glutamate isolated hemidiaphragms starved rats. Phenylalanine inhibited lactate 14CO2 production substrates stimulated alanine release. concluded pyruvate kinase may dual role intermediary metabolism skeletal muscle: enzyme component lower glycolytic pathway implicated pathway amino acid oxidation alanine synthesis.
