 Activity-body size relationships eight enzymes (citrate synthase, CS; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; pyruvate kinase, PK; alanine aminotransferase, ala AT; aspartate aminotransferase, asp AT; glutamate dehydrogenase, GDH; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6Pdh; nucleoside diphosphate kinase, NDPK) examined brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana. animals fed alga Dunaliella salina, provided three concentrations representing 25-fold range. Enzyme activities per animal (Y) regressed body size (M, expressed dry mass protein) form allometric equation, log = log + b log M, b fitted constants. enzymes considered, value scaling exponent (b) significantly higher dry mass used, body size index, protein mass used. Therefore, index body size chosen influence exponent obtained allometric studies. Although specific growth rates different cultures varied greatly, significant differences scaling relationships found cultures enzyme. many enzymes, growth rate may source variation scaling relationships. Unlike enzymes examined, log-transformed NDPK activity versus log-transformed mass linear; NDPK activity reached plateau. Variation NDPK scaling relationships growth may provide means predict growth rate Artemia.
