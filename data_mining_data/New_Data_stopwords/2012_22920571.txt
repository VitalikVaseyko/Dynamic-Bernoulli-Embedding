 intake metabolism carbohydrates generation energy biomass evolutionarily conserved, primitive cells. Although basal rate glucose metabolism occurs cells, processing rates glucose become dramatically enhanced cells acquire malignant properties, remain undifferentiated. article investigates consequences increased glucose metabolism affects cellular physiology altering physicochemical properties whole metabolic network. result, enhanced lactate production presence oxygen (the Warburg effect) required, metabolism consequently reconfigured, multiple mechanisms, confer numerous physiological possibly regulatory properties cells.
