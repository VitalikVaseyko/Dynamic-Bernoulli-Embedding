 Verapamil shown inhibit glucose transport several cell types. However, consequences inhibition central metabolism well known. study focused verapamil induced changes metabolic fluxes murine atrial cell line (HL-1 cells). cells adapted serum free conditions incubated 4 muM verapamil [U-(1)(3)C(5)] glutamine. Specific extracellular metabolite uptake/production rates together mass isotopomer fractions alanine glutamate implemented metabolic network model calculate metabolic flux distributions central metabolism. Verapamil decreased specific glucose consumption rate glycolytic activity 60%. Although HL-1 cells show Warburg effect high lactate production, verapamil treated cells completely stopped lactate production 24 h maintaining growth comparable untreated cells. Calculated fluxes TCA cycle reactions well NADH/FADH(2) production rates similar treated untreated cells. confirmed measurement cell respiration. Reduction lactate production seems consequence decreased glucose uptake due verapamil. case tumors, may two fold effects; firstly depriving cancer cells substrate anaerobic glycolysis growth dependent; secondly changing pH tumor environment, lactate secretion keeps pH acidic facilitates tumor growth. results shown study may partly explain recent observations verapamil proposed potential anticancer agent. Moreover, biotechnological production using cell lines, verapamil may used reduce glucose uptake lactate secretion thereby increasing protein production without introduction genetic modifications application complicated fed-batch processes.
