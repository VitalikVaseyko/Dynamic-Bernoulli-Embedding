 Patients von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease frequently develop clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, sought determine global proteome alterations distinguish ccRCC tissue adjacent, non-malignant kidney tissue VHL-patients. quantitative proteomic analysis clearly discriminated tumor non-malignant tissue. Significantly dysregulated proteins distinguished using linear models microarray data algorithm. ccRCC tissue, noticed predominant under-representation proteins involved tricarboxylic acid cycle increase proteins involved glycolysis. profile possibly represents proteomic fingerprint "Warburg effect", molecular hallmark ccRCC. Furthermore, observed increase proteins involved extracellular matrix organization. also noticed differential expression many exoproteases ccRCC tissue. particular note opposing alterations Xaa-Pro Aminopeptidases-1 -2 (XPNPEP-1 -2): strong decrease XPNPEP-2 ccRCC accompanied abundant presence related protease XPNPEP-1. cases, corroborated proteomic results immunohistochemical analysis ccRCC adjacent, non-malignant kidney tissue VHL patients. functionally investigate role XPNPEP-1 ccRCC, performed small-hairpin RNA mediated XPNPEP-1 expression silencing 786-O ccRCC cells harboring mutated VHL gene. found XPNPEP-1 expression dampens cellular proliferation migration. results suggest XPNPEP-1 likely anti-target ccRCC. Methodologically, work validates robustness using FFPE material quantitative proteomics.
