 prokaryotic eukaryotic organisms, nucleoside diphosphate kinase multifunctional protein, well defined functions ribo- deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate biosynthesis recently described functions genetic metabolic regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair. paper concerns two unusual properties nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase Escherichia coli: 1) ability interact specifically enzymes encoded virulent bacteriophage T4 2) roles regulating metabolism host cell. means optical biosensor analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, immunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, shown E. coli NDP kinase interacts directly T4 thymidylate synthase, aerobic ribonucleotide reductase, dCTPase-dUTPase, gene 32 single-strand DNA-binding protein, deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase. interactions ribonucleotide reductase gp32 enhanced nucleoside triphosphates, suggesting integrity T4 dNTP synthetase complex vivo influenced composition nucleotide pool. investigations work stem unexpected finding E. coli NDP kinase dispensable successful T4 phage infection, deal two observations suggesting NDP kinase protein plays genetic role regulating metabolism host cell: 1) elevation CTP synthetase activity ndk mutant, structural gene NDP kinase disrupted, 2) apparent ability NDP kinase suppress anaerobic growth pyruvate kinase-negative E. coli mutant. data indicate regulatory roles metabolic, genetic, nature.
