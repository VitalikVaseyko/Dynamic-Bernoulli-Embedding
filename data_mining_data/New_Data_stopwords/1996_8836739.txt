 L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene regulated diet hormones expressed high levels hepatocytes, enterocytes, proximal tubular cells kidney low levels endocrine pancreatic cells. Two regulatory regions shown important transgenic mice confer reporter gene similar tissue-specific diet-responsive expression: proximal promoter fragment, binding sites tissue-specific hepatocyte nuclear factors 1 4, presence glucose-response element (GIRE) distal activator corresponding liver-specific hypersensitive site -3000 bp respect cap site. Although proximal promoter able confer tissue-specific expression reporter gene, activity vivo strongly stimulated distal activator. determine possible role distal region diet responsiveness tissue specificity L-PK gene expression, created lines transgenic mice gene SV40 antigen (Tag) directed composite regulatory sequences consisting L-PK promoter different enhancers: either SV40 early enhancer (SV) H enhancer aldolase gene (H). induction composite H-PK/Tag SV-PK/Tag transgenes carbohydrate-rich diet liver similar endogenous L-PK gene. suggests fasted mice L-PK promoter, especially GIRE, able silence activating influence strong viral enhancer SV40 enhancer. H-PK/Tag mice expressed transgene similarly endogenous gene, except pancreas, expression practically undetectable. Consistently, whereas L-PK/Tag mice develop insulinomas, H-PK/Tag mice develop hepatomas. contrast, transgene expression partly aberrant SV-PK/Tag mice. addition normal activation transgene liver, strong expression also detected kidney medulla, whereas transgene practically silent enterocytes. Finally, effect distal region (-2070 -3200) ubiquitous promoter tested ligating distal L-PK gene fragment front thymidine kinase/CAT transgene. transgene constantly expressed pancreas and, strikingly, brain. appears, therefore, L-PK distal activator exhibits, itself, certain neuropancreatic specificity required combination proximal promoter L-PK gene expression pancreas endocrine cells.
