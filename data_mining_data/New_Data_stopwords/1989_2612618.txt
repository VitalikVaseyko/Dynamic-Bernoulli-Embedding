 Erythrocytes separated age using combination density centrifugation counterflow centrifugation tested basal activity hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP-shunt) well methylene blue-stimulated maximal capacity measuring CO2 production. significant differences found basal HMP-shunt activity, maximal methylene blue-stimulated activity old erythrocytes reached half activity total cell population. maximal HMP-shunt activity showed significant correlation hexokinase activity, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity youngest cells. sensitivity oxidative stress tested measuring kinetics pyruvate kinase isolated erythrocytes incubated presence absence methylene blue. Pyruvate kinase kinetics affected old cell population total cell population: K0.5 phosphoenol-pyruvate increased four times unseparated cells eight times old cells.
