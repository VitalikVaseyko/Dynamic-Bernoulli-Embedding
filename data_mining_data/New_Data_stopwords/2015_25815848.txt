 Cancers progress series events characterized "somatic evolution." central premise Darwinian evolutionary theory environment imparts pressure select species fit within particular microenvironmental context. Furthermore, rate evolution proportional (1) strength environmental selection (2) phenotypic variance selected population. notable that, progression cancers carcinogenesis local invasion metastasis, selective landscape continuously changes, throughout process, increased selection cells altered metabolic phenotypes: implying phenotypes impart selective advantage process environmental selection. One prevalent selected phenotypes aerobic glycolysis, is, continued fermentation glucose even presence adequate oxygen. mechanisms so-called "Warburg effect" well studied, multiple models explain occurs molecular level. Herein, propose unifying insights gained evaluating environmental context within phenotype arises. words, focus "how" "why" cancer cells exhibit high aerobic glycolysis. best approached examining sequelae aerobic glycolysis may impart selective advantage. Many considered, including generation anabolic substrates, response rates glycolysis vis-a-vis respiration, generation antioxidants. sequeala considered aerobic glycolysis results high rate lactic acid production; resulting acidification extracellular space. Indeed, shown low extracellular pH promotes local invasion, promotes metastasis, inhibits antitumor immunity. naturally occurring cancers, low extracellular pH strong negative prognostic indicator metastasis-free survival. Furthermore, shown inhibition extracellular acidosis inhibit metastasis promote antitumor immunity. Hence, propose excess acid production confers selective advantage cells somatic evolution cancers.
