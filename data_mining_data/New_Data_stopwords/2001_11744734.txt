 One key mediators hypoxic response animal cells hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) complex, alpha-subunit highly susceptible oxygen-dependent degradation. hypoxic response manifested many pathophysiological processes tumor growth metastasis. hypoxia, cells shift primarily glycolytic metabolic mode energetic needs. also manifested HIF-1-dependent up-regulation many glycolytic genes. Paradoxically, tumor cells growing conditions normal oxygen tension also show elevated glycolytic rates correlate increased expression glycolytic enzymes glucose transporters (the Warburg effect). key regulator glycolytic flux relatively recently discovered fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2), allosteric activator 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1). Steady state levels F-2,6-P2 maintained bifunctional enzyme PFK-2/F2,6-Bpase, kinase phosphatase activities. Herein, show one isozyme, PFKFB3, highly induced hypoxia hypoxia mimics cobalt desferrioxamine. induction could replicated use inhibitor prolyl hydroxylase enzymes responsible von Hippel Lindau (VHL)-dependent destabilization tagging HIF-1 alpha. absolute dependence PFKFB3 gene HIF-1 confirmed overexpression VHL-deficient cells lack hypoxic induction mouse embryonic fibroblasts conditionally nullizygous HIF-1 alpha.
