 effects glucagon serine: pyruvate/alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (SPT/AGT) gene expression studied primary cultured rat hepatocytes. hepatocytes precultured 16-18 h serum- hormone-free conditions, addition glucagon caused (after lag period 2 h) remarkable increase cellular level SPT/AGT mRNA 4 h time- dose-dependent manner. induced mRNA mitochondrial SPT/AGT, judged ribonuclease protection analysis. nuclear run-on assay revealed activation transcription responsible increase mitochondrial SPT/AGT mRNA maximal rate transcription occurs 1.5 h glucagon addition. effect glucagon mimicked 8-bromo-cAMP suppressed N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide, inhibitor cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate A23187 without effect elevating SPT/AGT mRNA level, suggesting cAMP/protein kinase system involved regulation SPT/AGT gene expression. hepatocytes precultured 16-18 h serum- hormone-free conditions, glucagon-induced transcription severely inhibited cycloheximide. preculture 2 h, hand, activation transcription glucagon rapid, inhibition cycloheximide less observed cells precultured 16-18 h, suggesting short-lived protein factor involved hormonal regulation. glucagon-induced expression SPT/AGT gene also turned dexamethasone.
