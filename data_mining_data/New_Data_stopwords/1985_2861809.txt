 Energy metabolism proliferating cultured rat thymocytes compared freshly prepared non-proliferating resting cells. Cultured rat thymocytes enter proliferative cycle stimulation concanavalin Lymphocult (interleukin-2), maximal rates DNA synthesis 60 h. Compared incubated resting thymocytes, glucose metabolism incubated proliferating thymocytes 53-fold increased; 90% amount glucose utilized converted lactate, whereas resting cells metabolized 56% lactate. However, latter oxidized 27% glucose CO2, opposed 1.1% proliferating cells. Activities hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase aldolase proliferating thymocytes increased 12-, 17-, 30- 24-fold respectively, whereas rate pyruvate oxidation enhanced 3-fold. relatively low capacity pyruvate degradation proliferating thymocytes might reason almost complete conversion glucose lactate cells. Glutamine utilization rat thymocytes 8-fold increased proliferation. major end products glutamine metabolism glutamate, aspartate, CO2 ammonia. complete recovery glutamine carbon nitrogen products obtained. amount glutamate formed phosphate-dependent glutaminase entered citric acid cycle enhanced 5-fold proliferating cells: 76% converted 2-oxoglutarate aspartate aminotransferase, present high activity, remaining 24% glutamate dehydrogenase. resting cells percentages obtained (75 25). Maximal activities glutaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase aspartate aminotransferase increased 3-, 12- 6-fold respectively proliferating cells; 32% glutamate metabolized citric acid cycle recovered CO2 61% aspartate. resting cells proportion 41% 59% mitogen-stimulated cells 39% 65% respectively. Addition glucose (4 mM) malate (2 mM) strongly decreased rates glutamine utilization glutamate conversion 2-oxoglutarate proliferating thymocytes also affected pathways glutamate metabolism. Addition 2 mM-pyruvate alter rate glutamine utilization proliferating thymocytes, decreased rate metabolism beyond stage glutamate significantly. Formation acetyl-CoA presence pyruvate might explain relatively enhanced oxidation glutamate CO2 (56%) proliferating thymocytes.
