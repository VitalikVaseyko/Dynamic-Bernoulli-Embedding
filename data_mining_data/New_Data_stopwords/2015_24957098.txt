 Mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2) catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation malate yield CO2 pyruvate, concomitant reduction dinucleotide cofactor NAD(+) NADP(+). find ME2 highly expressed many solid tumors. A549 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, ME2 depletion inhibits cell proliferation induces cell death differentiation, accompanied increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) NADP(+)/NADPH ratio, drop ATP, increased sensitivity cisplatin. ME2 knockdown impacts phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) expression, leading AKT inhibition. Depletion ME2 leads malate accumulation pyruvate decrease, exogenous cell permeable dimethyl-malate (DMM) mimics ME2 knockdown phenotype. ME2 knockdown DMM treatment reduce A549 cell growth vivo. Collectively, data suggest ME2 potential target cancer therapy.
