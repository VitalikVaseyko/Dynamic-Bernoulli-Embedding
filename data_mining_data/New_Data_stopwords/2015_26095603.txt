 Invasiveness hallmark aggressive cancer like malignant melanoma, factors involved acquisition maintenance invasive phenotype attractive targets therapy. investigated melanoma phenotype modulation induced metastasis-promoting microenvironmental protein S100A4, focusing relationship enhanced cellular motility, dedifferentiation metabolic changes. poorly motile, well-differentiated Melmet 5 cells, S100A4 stimulated migration, invasion simultaneously down-regulated differentiation genes modulated expression metabolism genes. Metabolic studies confirmed suppressed mitochondrial respiration activated glycolytic flux S100A4 stimulated cells, indicating metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect. Reversal glycolytic switch dichloracetate induced apoptosis reduced cell growth, particularly S100A4 stimulated cells. implies cells stimulated invasiveness get survival benefit glycolytic switch and, therefore, become vulnerable glycolysis inhibition. conclusion, data indicate transition invasive phenotype melanoma involves dedifferentiation metabolic reprogramming mitochondrial oxidation glycolysis, facilitates survival invasive cancer cells. Therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic reprogramming may therefore effective invasive phenotype.
