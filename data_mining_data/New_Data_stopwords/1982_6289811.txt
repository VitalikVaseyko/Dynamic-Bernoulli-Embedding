 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity crude extracts muscle frequently determined using continuous spectrophotometric method, shown grossly overestimate enzyme activity. NADH oxidation attributed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity assay due lactate production. normal assay conditions. Na+ ions stimulate pyruvate kinase, providing pyruvate lactate formation lactate dehydrogenase sufficiently account observed NADH oxidation.
