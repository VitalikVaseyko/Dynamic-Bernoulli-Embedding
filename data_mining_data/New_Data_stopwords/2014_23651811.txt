 BACKGROUND: Botulinum toxin (BTX) B commonly used aesthetic indications neuromuscular disorders. New concepts seek prove efficacy BTX critical tissue perfusion. aim evaluate BTX B mouse model critical flap ischemia preoperative intraoperative application. METHODS: BTX B applied vascular pedicle axial pattern flap mice preoperatively intraoperatively. Blood flow, tissue oxygenation, tissue metabolism, flap necrosis rate, apoptosis assay, RhoA eNOS expression endpoints. RESULTS: Blood-flow measurements 1 flap operation revealed significant reduction 53% control group, flow maintained increased BTX groups (103%-129%). 5 BTX groups showed significant increase blood flow 166-187% (P < 0.01). Microdialysis revealed increase glucose reduced lactate/pyruvate ratio glycerol levels flap tissue BTX groups. resulted significantly improved tissue survival BTX groups compared control group (62% +/- 10%; P < 0.01): BTX preconditioning (84% +/- 5%), BTX application intraoperatively (88% +/- 4%), BTX B preconditioning (91% +/- 4%), intraoperative BTX B treatment (92% +/- 5%). confirmed TUNEL assay. Immunofluorescence demonstrated RhoA eNOS expression BTX groups. BTX applications similarly effective, despite pharmacologic dissimilarities different timing. CONCLUSIONS: conclusion, able show vascular, tissue, cell, molecular level BTX injection feeding arteries supports flap survival ameliorated blood flow oxygen delivery.
