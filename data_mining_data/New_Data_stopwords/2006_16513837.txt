 widely recognized vasculature tumor inadequate meet demands growing mass. malformed vasculature least part responsible regions tumor hypoxic, acidotic, exposed increased interstitial fluid pressure. unique aspects tumor microenvironment shown act barriers conventional chemotherapy radiation-based therapies. seems vasculature initiates tumor-specific conditions, cells within tumor respond stresses add unique solid tumor physiology. Gene expression changes reported tumor vascular endothelial growth factor, carbonic anhydrase IX, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. activity gene products influences tumor physiology alterations vascular permeability interstitial fluid pressure, extracellular acidosis, mitochondrial oxygen consumption hypoxia, respectively. Novel molecular strategies designed interfere activities gene products devised ways overcome physiologic barriers tumor standard anticancer therapies.
