 Many articles discussed relationship fructose consumption incidence obesity related diseases. Fructose absorbed intestine metabolized liver glucose, lactate, glycogen, and, lesser extent, lipids. Unabsorbed fructose causes bacterial fermentation, resulting irritable bowl syndrome. Therefore, understanding mechanisms underlying intestinal hepatic fructose metabolism important treatment metabolic syndrome fructose malabsorption. Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) glucose-activated transcription factor controls approximately 50% de novo lipogenesis liver. ChREBP target genes involved glycolysis (Glut2, liver pyruvate kinase), fructolysis (Glut5, ketohexokinase), lipogenesis (acetyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase). ChREBP gene deletion protects high sucrose diet-induced leptin-deficient obesity, Chrebp(-/-) mice cannot consume fructose sucrose. Moreover, ChREBP contributes physiological effects fructose sweet taste preference glucose production regulation ChREBP target genes, fibroblast growth factor-21 glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunits. Thus, ChREBP might play roles fructose metabolism. Restriction excess fructose intake beneficial preventing metabolic syndrome also irritable bowl syndrome.
