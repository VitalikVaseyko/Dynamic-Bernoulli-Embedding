 Bovine skeletal muscle tissue significant value beef industry global economy. Proteomic analyses offer opportunity detect molecular mechanisms regulating muscle growth intramuscular fat accumulation. current study aimed investigate differences protein abundance skeletal muscle tissue cattle two breeds contrasting maturity (early vs. late maturing), adiposity, muscle growth potential, namely, Belgian Blue (BB) x Holstein Friesian Aberdeen Angus (AA) x Holstein Friesian. Twenty AA (n = 10) BB (n = 10) sired steers, progeny sires either high low genetic merit, expressed expected progeny difference carcass weight (EPDcwt), bred AI, evaluated 4 genetic groups, BB-High, BB-Low, AA-High, AA-Low (n = 5 per treatment). Chemical composition analysis M. longissimus lumborum showed greater protein moisture decreased lipid concentrations BB-sired compared AA-sired steers. investigate effects sire breed EPDcwt M. longissimus lumborum, proteomic analysis performed using 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis followed mass spectrometry. Proteins identified peptide sequences, using National Center Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Swiss-prot databases. Metabolic enzymes involved glycolysis (glycogen phosphorylase, phosphoglycerate mutase) citric acid cycle (aconitase 2, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) increased AA- vs. BB-sired steers. Expression proteins involved cell structure, myosin light chain isoforms troponins T, also altered due sire breed. Furthermore, heat shock protein beta-1 peroxiredoxin 6, involved cell defense, increased abundance muscle AA-sired relative BB-sired steers. Protein abundance glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, enolase-3, pyruvate kinase greater AA-sired animals High compared Low EPDcwt. Changes expression proteins supported gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR. information aid understanding genetic influences controlling muscle growth fat accumulation could contribute future breeding programs increase lean tissue gain beef cattle.
