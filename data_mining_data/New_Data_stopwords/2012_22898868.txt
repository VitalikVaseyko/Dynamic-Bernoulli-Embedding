 Ability adapt conditions limited nutrient supply requires reorganization metabolic pathways balance energy generation production biosynthetic intermediates. Several fast-growing cells overexpress P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) extracellular ATP. feature receptor allow growth absence serum. show transfection P2X7R allows proliferation P2X7R-transfected HEK293 (HEK293-P2X7) cells absence serum also low (4 mM) glucose, increases lactate output compared mock-transfected HEK293 (HEK293-mock) cells. HEK293-P2X7, lactate output stimulated upon addition exogenous ATP mitochondrial uncoupler carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). human neuroblastoma cell line ACN, lactate output also dependent P2X7R function. P2X7R-expressing cells upregulate (a) glucose transporter Glut1, (b) glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), (c) phosphofructokinase (PFK), (d) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) (e) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1); furthermore, P2X7R expression (a) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, (b) increases phosphorylated Akt/PKB hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression (c) enhances intracellular glycogen stores. HEK293-P2X7 cells, glucose deprivation increases lactate production, expression glycolytic enzymes ph-Akt/PKB level. data show P2X7R intrinsic ability reprogram cell metabolism meet needs imposed adverse environmental conditions.
