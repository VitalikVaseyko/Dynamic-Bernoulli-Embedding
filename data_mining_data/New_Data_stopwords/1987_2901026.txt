 Epithelial liver cells Chinese hamster (CHEL cells) propagated culture 35 passages. favourable cell densities, population doubling time normal medium, 20 h. L-Tyrosine amino transferase activity retained measurable level, enhancement dexamethasone detected solely cells early passages. Pyruvate kinase strongly activated fructose-1,6-biphosphate low substrate concentrations. enzymatic properties suggest CHEL cells derived sub-population parenchymal hepatocytes cells closely related parenchymal hepatocytes. lag period hours, CHEL cultures metabolized benzo[a]pyrene. cell homogenates various monooxygenase activities investigated detection limits. However, xenobiotic-metabolizing activities, cytochrome P-450 reductase, glutathione transferase UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase high, levels comparable observed freshly isolated rat parenchymal cells. Epoxide hydrolase activity also detected, lower liver. CHEL cells able activate benzo[a]pyrene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene aflatoxin B1 mutagens, shown co-culture assay V79 cells, acquisition resistance 6-thioguanine studied. early passages, CHEL cells near diploid set chromosomes. Then, gradually frequency cells slight changes number chromosomes frequency tetraploids increased. observation period (up passage 20) modal number chromosomes shifted 22 23. gross morphological changes cultures noticed 20 passages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
