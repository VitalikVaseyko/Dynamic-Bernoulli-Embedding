 present study analyzes battery biomarkers water bug Belostoma elegans stream polluted organic matter (OMS), another one considered reference site (RS) spring-summer season (December March). Biochemical parameters glucidic, lipidic oxidative metabolic pathways analyzed males females insect. general, significant differences observed biomarkers assayed sexes, except lactate concentration higher males females (p < 0.0006) first three months. carbohydrate metabolism parameters, pyruvate-kinase showed significant differences insects collected streams (p < 0.05) December. However, total lipid content, saturated fatty acid, mainly triacylglycerol higher insects RS compared OMS (p < 0.002) sampled months. Levels lipoperoxidation, protein oxidation, reduced glutathione glutathione-S-transferase activity showed differences insects collected streams. Nevertheless, significant increase observed superoxide dismutase catalase activities (p < 0.004) could due elevated oxidative metabolism insects RS compared OMS lower dissolved oxygen. Regarding responding parameters, males accounted differences two sites study period. conclusion, results support lipidic energetic reserves antioxidant enzyme activities B. elegans could used biomarkers environmental pollution organic matter.
