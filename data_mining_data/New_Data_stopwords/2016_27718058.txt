 Mitochondrial structural functional integrity defines health cell regulating cellular metabolism. Thus, mitochondria play important role cell proliferation cell death. Cancer cells metabolically altered compared normal cells ability survive better proliferate faster. Resistance apoptosis important characteristic cancer cells given contribution mitochondria apoptosis, imperative mitochondria could behave differently tumor situation. feature associated cancer cells Warburg effect, engages shift metabolism. Although Warburg effect often occurs conjunction dysfunctional mitochondria, relationship mitochondria, Warburg effect, cancer cell metabolism clearly decoded. changes, several mitochondrial gene mutations occur cancer cells, mitochondrial biogenesis affected mitochondria see structural functional variations. cancer pharmacology, targeting mitochondria mitochondria associated signaling pathways reduce tumor proliferation growing field interest. chapter summarizes various changes mitochondria relevance cancer, behavior mitochondria tumorigenesis, progress using mitochondria therapeutic target cancer.
