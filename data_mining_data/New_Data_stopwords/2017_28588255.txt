 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key kinase glycolysis characteristic proliferating cells. role PKM2 gastric cancer (GC) still ambiguous yet determined. better understand role PKM2 migration invasion GC, measured expression PKM2 GC cell lines using qRT-PCR western blot. prognostic value PKM2 analyzed Immunohistochemistry cohort containing 88 GC patients. PKM2 knocked short hairpin RNA plasmid vector NCI-N87 BGC-823 cells, biological behavior downstream signaling pathways also investigated vitro. Subcutaneous xenografts pulmonary metastases models constructed nude mice compare differences tumorgenesis metastasis Knockdown PKM2. results obtained vitro cell biological behavior, vivo tumorigenicity studies, primary GC samples revealed oncogenic role PKM2 GC. Furthermore, GC patients received radical resection, PKM2 might serve novel prognostic biomarker target would allow brand new treatment strategy GC clinical settings.
