 BACKGROUND: 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) analog glucose preferentially captured tumors accumulated transformed cells, phosphorylated molecule (2-DG-6P) cannot metabolized diffused outside cells. Targeted fluorine atom, 18F-DG currently used visualize malignant tumors (PET scan). Although cancer cells reported strongly dependent glycolysis (Warburg effect), reports studied inhibitory effects 2-DG cancer. MATERIALS METHODS: objective study, large panel human malignant cells various origins (ovarian, squamous, cerebral, hepatic, colonic mesothelial), inhibitory activity 2DG tumor growth could considered general phenomenon determine effect cell cycle. RESULTS: Four types response different cell lines observed cells cultured presence 2-DG (5 mM) continuous exposure: proliferation slow down; proliferation arrest without signs apoptosis; strong cell cycle arrest accompanied moderate apoptosis induction; massive apoptosis. CONCLUSION: 2-DG appears interesting new therapeutic agent cancer vitro, tested vivo studies.
