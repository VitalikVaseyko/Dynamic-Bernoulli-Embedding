 allosteric inhibition M1-type pyruvate kinase rabbit skeletal muscle phenylalanine reciprocally dependent Mg2+ phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations. pH 8, phenylalanine acts competitive inhibitor respect Mg2+ phosphoenolpyruvate, vice versa. Phenylalanine introduces sigmoidicity dependence reaction velocity [Mg2+]. vitro kinetic analysis indicates phenylalanine inhibition muscle pyruvate kinase unlikely regulatory significance vivo.
