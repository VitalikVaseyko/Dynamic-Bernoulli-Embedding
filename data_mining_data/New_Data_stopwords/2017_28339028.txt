 HIF-1alpha overexpression associated radio-resistance various cancers. radioresistant human melanoma cell model MDA-MB-435R (435R) established us previously. Compared parental cells MDA-MB435 (435S), elevated level HIF-1alpha expression 435R cells demonstrated recent experiments. Therefore, current study, sought determine whether selective HIF-1alpha inhibitors could radiosensitize 435R cells X-ray, identify potential mechanisms. data demonstrated inhibition HIF-1alpha 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2) significantly enhanced radiosensitivity 435R cells. 2-MeOE2 increased DNA damage ratio apoptosis cells induced irradiation. Whereas, cell proliferation expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) decreased 2-MeOE2 treatment. change expression GLUT1, LDHA cellular ATP level extracellular lactate production indicates 2-MeOE2 suppressed glycolytic state 435R cells. addition, radioresistance, glycolytic state cell proliferation 435R cells also decreased inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) dichloroacetate (DCA). DCA could also increase DNA damage ratio apoptotic cells induced irradiation. results also suggest inhibition HIF-1alpha 2-MeOE2 sensitizes radioresistant melanoma cells 435R X-ray irradiation targeting glycolysis regulated PDK1. Selective inhibitors HIF-1alpha glycolysis potential drugs enhance radio-sensitivity melanoma cells.
