 dynamics glycolysis glycogenolysis postnatal period, determined accumulation lactate homogenate heart muscle, indicates glycolytic activity begins subside right birth becomes constant lapse 15-20 days. activity phosphorylase, phosphohexoisomerase, enolase pyruvate-kinase heart muscle extract found remain virtually unchanged. decline noted activity aldolase hexokinase, phosphofructokinase lactate-dehydrogenase rises 50-60 per cent. data suggest early ontogenesis increasing capacity mitochondrial system heart muscle paralled adjustable conditioned inhibition glycolytic phosphorylation, concurrently rising activity phosphofructokinas and, consequently, also potential capacity glycolysis glycogenolysis.
