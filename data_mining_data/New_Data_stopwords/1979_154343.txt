 metabolic effects associated defective pyruvate kinase (PK) two variants congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia primary PK primary adenosine triphosphatase (ATP-ase) (Mg++) deficiency respectively compared. one patient low erythrocyte ATP level, decreased PK activity appeared together irreversible loss sensitivity fructose-I,6-diphosphate (FDP), independently experimental conditions. second patient, decrease PK activity associated elevated erythrocyte ATP level secondary effect, due primary ATP-ase (Mg++) deficiency. Removal excessive amounts ATP, dialysis haemolysates in-vitro treatment ATP-ase, increased PK activity normal range restored sensitivity stimulatory effect FDP. Similar effects could obtained i.v. administration magnesium laevulinate. vivo conditions ATP level normalized transient rise ATP-ase activity, PK activity increased sensitivity FDP reappeared.
