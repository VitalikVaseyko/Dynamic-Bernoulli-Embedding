 cDNA clones encoding testis-specific form rat pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 alpha subunit isolated. Comparison predicted amino acid sequence somatic testis-specific E1 alpha forms man mouse somatic E1 alpha form rat indicates change serine residue, believed phosphorylated vivo pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha-specific kinase, alanine position 233. implications change discussed. Northern blot analysis RNase protection assays indicate expression mRNA encoding testis-specific E1 alpha subunit restricted testis whereas mRNA somatic form found tissues analyzed, albeit small amounts testis.
