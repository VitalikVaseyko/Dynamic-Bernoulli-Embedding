 Metabolism process cells convert relatively simple extracellular nutrients energy building blocks necessary growth survival. cancer cells, metabolism dramatically altered compared normal cells. alterations known Warburg effect. One consequence changes cellular addiction glutamine. this, recent years enzyme glutaminase become key target small molecule therapeutic intervention. Like many oncotargets, however, glutaminase number upstream partners might offer additional druggable targets. review summarizes work current decade surrounding glutaminase regulation, suggests strategies therapeutic intervention relevant cases.
