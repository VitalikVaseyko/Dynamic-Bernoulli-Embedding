 part development structured models metabolism myeloma cells suspension culture, study made subcellular localization key enzymes glucose glutamine metabolism. Steady state chemostat cultures mouse myeloma SP2/0-Ag14 used reproducible source biomass. Homogenates cells, obtained via mechanical disruption, separated mitochondrial cytosolic fraction via differential centrifugation. following conclusions drawn: (1) approximately one fifth hexokinase activity cell-free homogenates associated mitochondria; (2) malate-aspartate shuttle may operate oxidation cytosolic NADH, indicated high levels malate dehydrogenase aspartate aminotransferase particulate soluble fractions; (3) pentose phosphate pathway isocitrate dehydrogenase may contribute provision cytosolic NADPH; (4) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase, present high activities, exclusively cytosolic probably play key role glutamine metabolism; (5) oxidation glutamine via enzymes leads formation pyruvate enters pool pyruvate generated glycolysis. result, lactate alanine formation occur glucose glutamine.
