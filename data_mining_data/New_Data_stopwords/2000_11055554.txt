 Transient glucose deprivation heart [GLU (-)] confers preconditioning-like protection subsequent ischemic/reperfusion (I/R). mechanisms involved remain unclear. hypothesized GLU (-) would induce classic ischemic preconditioning activated signaling cascade. Potential metabolic consequences putative cell signaling events induced transient glucose deprivation evaluated candidate mediators cardioprotection. Isolated glucose-perfused rat hearts subjected 30 min global ischemia followed 30 min reperfusion (index I/R). Cardiac contractile recovery following I/R used functional end-point studies. Metabolic preconditioning stimulated 15 min GLU (-) followed 10 min glucose repletion prior index I/R. potential metabolic consequences GLU (-) evaluated using excess octanoate (11 mM OCT Hi) 11 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) place GLU (-) combining GLU (-) fuels known inhibit glycolysis supply (20 mM pyruvate 1 mM octanoate, OCT Lo). roles alpha-adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptors, adenosine receptors, protein kinase C (PKC) mitochondrial K(ATP) channels investigated using inhibitors prazosin (10 microM), propranolol (10 microM), 8-(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline, (SPT 100 microM), chelerythrine (CHEL 10 microM) 5-hydroxydecanoate (5 HD 100 microM) respectively. GLU (-) increased mechanical recovery (59.8 +/- 4.0 vs. 32.3 +/- 4.7%; p < 0.01). Protection abolished pyruvate 26.6 +/- 3.1; SPT 36.6 +/- 3.0; CHEL 35 +/- 4.8 5 HD 23.8 +/- 3.3%. separate set experiments, specificity SPT model tested preconditioning adenosine (100 microM) (34.7 +/- 4 vs. control 16.8 +/- 1.3%, p = 0.01) blocking protection dose SPT (16.3 +/- 1 .5%) used GLU (-) studies. Protection unaltered prazosin (50.2 +/- 3.3%), propranolol (55.5 +/- 4.0%), OCT Lo (50.2 +/- 2.5%). Protection mimicked OCT Hi (35.6 +/- 3.8%) 2-DG (34 +/- 4.3%). Transient glucose deprivation seem achieve preconditioning-like cardioprotection decreased glycolysis. Rather, signal system may involve enhanced adenosine release, PKC, activation mitochondrial K(ATP) channel.
