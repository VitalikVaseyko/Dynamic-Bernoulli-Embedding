 CC3/TIP30 metastasis tumor suppressor, reduced absent expression variety aggressive tumors. Overexpression CC3 tumor cells predisposes apoptosis response different death signals. found silencing CC3 expression increase apoptotic resistance cells. However, strongly improves survival tumor cells response glucose limitation. HeLa cells silenced CC3 survive long-term low glucose, and, comparison control HeLa cells, show superior metabolic adaptation glucose limitation. First, unlike parental HeLa cells, HeLa silenced CC3 activate maintain high levels mitochondrial respiration critical ability thrive low glucose. Second, silencing CC3 leads higher expression levels mitochondrial proteins respiration complexes cells continuously cultured limiting glucose. Third, HeLa cells silenced CC3 maintain higher levels c-MYC M2 isoform pyruvate kinase low glucose, contributing efficient glycolysis. Fourth, HeLa cells silenced CC3 fail fully activate AMPK response glucose limitation. Inhibition AMPK, either pharmacologic via siRNA, protects control HeLa cells death low glucose. metabolic flexibility acquired cells silencing CC3 could directly relevant development metastatic aggressive human tumors frequently low absent expression CC3.
