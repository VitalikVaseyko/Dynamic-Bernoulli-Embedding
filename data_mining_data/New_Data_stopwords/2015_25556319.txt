 sarcoplasmic proteome beef Longissimus lumborum demonstrating animal-to-animal variation color stability examined correlate proteome profile color. Longissimus lumborum (36 h post-mortem) muscles obtained 73 beef carcasses, aged 13 days, fabricated 2.5-cm steaks. One steak allotted retail display, another immediately vacuum packaged frozen -80 degrees C. Aerobically packaged steaks stored display, color evaluated days 0 11. steaks ranked based redness color stability day 11, ten color-stable ten color-labile carcasses identified. Sarcoplasmic proteome frozen steaks selected carcasses analyzed. Nine proteins differentially abundant color-stable color-labile steaks. Three glycolytic enzymes (phosphoglucomutase-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase M2) over-abundant color-stable steaks positively correlated (P<0.05) redness color stability. results indicated animal variations proteome contribute differences beef color.
