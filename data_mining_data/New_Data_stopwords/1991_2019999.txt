 present study designed elucidate possible therapeutic effects naftidrofuryl brain glucose metabolism cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induced injecting 680 microspheres diameter 48 microns right internal carotid artery rat. ensuring onset symptoms stroke first day operation, rats treated intraperitoneal injections 15 mg/kg naftidrofuryl oxalate twice day. behavioral metabolic changes operated rats monitored 5th day surgery. symptoms gradually faded away, 3rd day on, microsphere-induced cerebral embolism. Tissue glucose glycogen greatly increased cerebral embolism, suggesting embolism-induced inhibition glycolysis. elucidate steps glycolytic catabolism inhibited cerebral ischemia, biochemical activities glycolytic enzymes Embden-Meyerhof pathway tricarboxylic acid cycle determined 3rd day surgery. Enzyme activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase inhibited, rather increased slightly cerebral embolism. Malate dehydrogenase activity brain mitochondria markedly increased microsphere-embolism, whereas enzyme activities tricarboxylic acid cycle never inhibited cerebral embolism. Treatment naftidrofuryl resulted appreciable reverse brain glucose glycogen levels substantial recovery altered enzyme activities normal levels Embden-Meyerhof pathway tricarboxylic acid cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
