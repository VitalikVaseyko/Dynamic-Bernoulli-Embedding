 Hypoxia long linked Warburg effect, yet underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. also known lncRNAs involved contribution hypoxia Warburg effect. show lincRNA-p21 hypoxia-responsive lncRNA essential hypoxia-enhanced glycolysis. Hypoxia/HIF-1alpha-induced lincRNA-p21 able bind HIF-1alpha VHL thus disrupts VHL-HIF-1alpha interaction. disassociation attenuates VHL-mediated HIF-1alpha ubiquitination causes HIF-1alpha accumulation. data indicate existence positive feedback loop HIF-1alpha lincRNA-p21 promotes glycolysis hypoxia. ability lincRNA-p21 promote tumor growth validated mouse xenograft models. Together, findings suggest lincRNA-p21 important player regulation Warburg effect also implicate lincRNA-p21 valuable therapeutic target cancer.
