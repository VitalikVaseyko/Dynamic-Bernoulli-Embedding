 study first examine effects endurance training elasmobranch fish. Twenty-four leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) divided randomly three groups. Eight sharks killed immediately, eight forced swim continuously 6 wk current 35 cm s-1 (60%-65% maximal sustainable swimming speed), eight held 6 wk tank without induced current. changes due training maximal sustainable speed, oxygen consumption rates, percentage myotome composed red white muscle fibers, blood oxygen-carrying capacity, liver mass, liver lipid, glycogen, protein concentrations, white muscle protein content, heart ventricle mass, specific activities enzymes citrate synthase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase heart ventricle. red myotomal muscle, citrate synthase activity increased 17% result training, change muscle fiber diameter. greatest effects occurred white myotomal muscle, 34% increase fiber diameter 36% increase activities citrate synthase lactate dehydrogenase occurred result training. conditioned fish also significantly higher growth rates. observed effects within myotomal muscle may reflect higher growth rates trained leopard sharks, may specific response increased energetic demands training activity, indicating characteristics limit swimming performance leopard sharks.
