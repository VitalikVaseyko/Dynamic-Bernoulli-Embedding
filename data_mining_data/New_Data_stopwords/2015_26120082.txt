 Malignant cells exhibit aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) become dependent de novo lipogenesis, sustains rapid proliferation resistance cellular stress. nuclear receptor liver-X-receptor (LXR) directly regulates expression key glycolytic lipogenic genes. disrupt oncogenic metabolism pathways, designed LXR inverse agonist SR9243 induces LXR-corepressor interaction. cancer cells, SR9243 significantly inhibited Warburg effect lipogenesis reducing glycolytic lipogenic gene expression. SR9243 induced apoptosis tumors without inducing weight loss, hepatotoxicity, inflammation. results suggest LXR inverse agonists may effective cancer treatment approach.
