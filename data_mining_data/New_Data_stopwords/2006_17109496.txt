 AIM: evaluate utility innovative fecal tumor M2-Pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) test daily clinical routine, marker pre-selection patients subsequently undergo colonoscopy diagnosis exclusion colorectal cancer. METHODS: Fecal tumor M2-PK measured stool samples 96 study participants (33 patients colorectal cancer, 21 patients rectal carcinoma 42 controls) underwent total colonoscopy. RESULTS: 39 42 individuals control group, fecal tumor M2-PK 4.0 kU/L (93% specificity). Colorectal tumors accompanied highly significant increase (P < 0.001) fecal tumor M2-PK levels (median: colon carcinoma, 23.1 kU/L; rectal carcinoma, 6.9 kU/L; colorectal carcinoma, 14.7 kU/L), correlated Duke's staging T-classification. overall sensitivity 78% colorectal cancer, increasing 60% stage T1 100% stage T4 60% Duke's 90% Duke's tumors. CONCLUSION: Fecal tumor M2-PK appropriately sensitive tool pre-select patients requiring colonoscopy diagnostic confirmation exclusion colorectal cancer.
