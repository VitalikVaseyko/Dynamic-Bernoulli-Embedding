 BACKGROUND: Life altitude depends adaptation ambient hypoxia. Andes, susceptibility chronic mountain sickness (CMS), clinical condition occurs native highlanders sea level natives prolonged residence high altitude, remains poorly understood. hypothesized hypoxia-associated gene expression children men CMS might identify markers predict development CMS adults. assessed distinct patterns gene expression hypoxia-responsive genes children highland Andean men, without CMS. METHODS: compared molecular signatures children highland (HA) men CMS (n = 10), without CMS (n = 10) sea level (SL) children (n = 20). Haemoglobin, haematocrit, oxygen saturation measured. Gene expression white cells assessed HA then, subjects, within one hour arrival sea level. RESULTS: HA children showed higher expression levels genes regulated HIF (hypoxia inducible factor) lower levels involved glycolysis tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1) HIF prolyl hydroxylase 3 (HPH3) mRNA expressions lowest children CMS fathers altitude. sea level pattern gene expression 3 children's groups indistinguishable. CONCLUSION: molecular signatures children CMS patients show impaired adaptation hypoxia. altitude children CMS fathers defective coupling glycolysis mitochondria TCA cycle, may key mechanism/biomarker adult CMS. Early biologic markers disease susceptibility Andeans might impact health services social planning.
