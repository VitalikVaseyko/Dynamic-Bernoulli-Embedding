 assessment red cell platelet function requires assay adenine nucleotides. describe use new LKB luminometer measure adenosine triphosphate (ATP) adenosine diphosphate (ADP) bioluminescence normal abnormal red cells platelets. ATP measured lysate red cells suspended buffer, pH 7.4, b ethanol extracts platelets platelet-rich plasma (PRP) c ethanol extracts supernatant platelet-poor plasma (PPP) following platelet aggregation collagen. ADP measured ATP phosphorylation pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Duplicate assays showed variance less 3%. Red cell lysates ethanol extracts PRP PPP stored -40 degrees C stable 4 weeks. Duplicate assays ATP ADP eight samples plus standards could performed 2 h. Normal values were: red cells (microM/ml red cells) (n = 20), ATP 1.15 +/- 0.17 (1 SD), ADP 0.22 +/- 0.07, ATP/ADP (mean ratio) 5.76:1, platelets (nm/10(9) platelets) (n = 20), ATP 53.3 +/- 7.6, ADP 27.8 +/- 5.8, ATP/ADP (mean ratio: 1.96:1). Abnormalities red cell ATP and/or ADP could demonstrated chronic renal failure, hereditary glycolytic enzyme deficiencies haemolytic states. myeloproliferative disorders defective platelet aggregation associated storage pool deficiency and/or impaired release ADP ATP could shown. conclude reliable, rapid economical technique measuring red cell platelet adenine nucleotides.
