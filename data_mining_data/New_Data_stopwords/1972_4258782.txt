 explain cause unique form severe intermittent ketoacidosis infant expired 6 months life, tissue culture fibroblasts post mortem tissue examined enzyme activities catalyze glucose ketoacid oxidation. measurable succinyl-CoA: 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase (CoA-transferase) activity could detected homogenates post mortem brain, muscle kidney tissue, cultured skin fibroblasts. Since seven enzyme activities involving glycolysis ketone body oxidation present tissues, reasonable conclude observed absence CoA-transferase activity artifact homogenate preparation. concluded absence CoA-transferase activity resulted loss intracellular homeostasis leading ketoacidosis. addition, absence enzyme appears reasonable explanation alteration glucose metabolism previously reported fibroblasts patient.
