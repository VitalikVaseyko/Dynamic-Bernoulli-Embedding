 Preparation L form rabbit liver pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate yielded enzyme kinetically identical muscle-type form pyruvate kinase found liver. Chromatographic dialysis studies complex showed fructose 1,6-diphosphate molecules loosely bound enzyme, dilution-dissociation studies binding experiments established high initial affinity enzyme fructose 1,6-diphosphate (K(assoc.)=2.3x10(9)), binding loosely bound fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentration-dependent necessary condition overcome co-operative interaction observed homotropic effector phosphoenolpyruvate. Preparation liver enzyme absence EDTA yield predominantly form enzyme, incubation form presence EDTA convert L form, resulted inhibition enzyme activity. Immunological studies confirmed L forms liver distinct, preparation L form presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate produce enzyme antigenically different L form prepared absence heterotropic effector.
