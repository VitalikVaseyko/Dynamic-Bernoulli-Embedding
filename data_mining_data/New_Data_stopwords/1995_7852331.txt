 L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene transcription induced glucose glucose response element (GlRE) composed two degenerated E boxes able bind vitro ubiquitous upstream stimulator factor (USF) proteins. demonstrate vivo, transient transfections hepatoma cells, (i) native USF proteins synthesized expression vectors act transactivators L-PK promoter via GlRE, stimulating transcription without glucose and, therefore, decreasing glucose responsiveness promoter; (ii) expression truncated USF proteins, able bind GlRE devoid NH2-terminal activation domain, represses activation L-PK promoter glucose; (iii) similar repression glucose effect observed upon expression mutant USF proteins devoid basic DNA binding domain, able dimerize endogenous USF bind GlRE. conclude USF proteins components transcriptional glucose response complex assembled L-PK gene promoter.
