 Studies conducted four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-containing fractions: purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase-protein X-kinase subcomplex (E2.X.K), kinase fraction (K fraction) prepared E2.X.K subcomplex, kinase fraction generated limited trypsin-digestion E2.X.K. characterized gel electrophoresis properties dissociated subunits (one-dimensional two-dimensional), catalytic ATP binding properties kinase-containing fractions, subunit requirements kinase binding activated transacetylase-protein X subcomplex (E2.X). significant portion protein X retained transacetylase core following release virtually kinase. K fraction four major bands separated sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis corresponded dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, protein X, trypsin-resistant catalytic subunit kinase chymotrypsin-resistant subunit high pI comigrated one-dimensional systems chymotrypsin-sensitive alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase component. purified kidney complex contained three molecules kinase (determined [14C]ATP binding), one molecule E2.X subcomplex activated large number (greater 15) molecules kinase associated protein X-containing K fraction. Sephadex G-200 chromatography K fraction presence dithiothreitol led coelution protein X kinase subunits. Limited trypsin digestion converted transacetylase subdomains cleaved protein X high pI subunit kinase. conditions, intact catalytic subunit kinase bind large inner domain transacetylase could activated untreated E2.X subcomplex. Thus, binding catalytic subunit kinase activation E2.X required either protein X lipoyl-bearing outer domain transacetylase. combination, results suggest protein X serves anchor kinase core complex.
