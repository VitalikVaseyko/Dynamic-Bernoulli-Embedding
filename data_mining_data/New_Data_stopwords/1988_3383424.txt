 Three families complete deficiency lactate dehydrogenase subunit show exertional myoglobinuria. response ischemic forearm work characteristic three families: increase venous lactate concentration ischemic work observed marked increase venous pyruvate found. Glycolysis markedly retarded patient's muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GA3PD) step. significant increases glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate fructose 1,6-diphosphate observed. glycolysis retardation may attributed impaired reoxidation NADH produced GA3PD action. cytosolic fraction skeletal muscle rich alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. enzyme reoxidizes excess NADH drains triose phosphates glycolytic pathway anaerobic conditions. reason, ATP production significantly impaired muscle cells damaged patients. Consequently, cytosolic enzymes proteins creatine kinase myoglobin released blood stream. Otherwise, patients lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit deficiency show muscle stiffness myoglobinuria ordinary circumstances. complain muscle rigidity sudden myoglobinuria strenous exercise anaerobic conditions. Thus, lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit deficiency show symptoms ordinary circumstances, latent hereditary disorder, recognized new type hereditary exertional myoglobinuria.
