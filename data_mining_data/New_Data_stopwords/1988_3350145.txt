 eight New Zealand white male rabbits abdominal aorta one iliofemoral artery balloon deendothelialized (group A). 2 weeks kept 6 weeks high cholesterol diet together eight unoperated rabbits (group B). Eight rabbits kept commercial diet (group C). degree atherosclerosis much higher deendothelialized Group vessels uninjured group B vessels. activity lactate dehydrogenase rate-limiting glycolytic pyruvate kinase significantly increased activity lipoamide dehydrogenase decreased group aortas. iliofemoral arteries similar statistically insignificant tendency detected. significant difference, however, aortic lactate three groups. Thus, local hypoxia significantly contribute high degree atherosclerosis group animals spite enzyme activity differences. Previous experience authors, using arterial microcathode pO2 measurements, indicates following deendothelialization adaptive proliferation nutrient vessels increased arterial oxygenation takes place. average activity lysosomal N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase five times beta-glucuronidase, seven times higher Group Group B aortas; iliofemoral arteries differences even larger. huge elevation hydrolases, involved glycosaminoglycan catabolism, provides indirect indication accumulation glycosaminoglycans possibly ability form complexes apoB-containing lipoproteins played major role much increased degree atherosclerotic lesions Group rabbits.
