 method developed calculation metabolic fluxes individual enzymatic reactions pyruvate metabolism including citric acid cycle rat liver mitochondrial incubated metabolic states state 4 state 3. method based measurement specific radioactivities products formed [2-14C]pyruvate. procedure energy balance mitochondria incubated presence [2-14C]pyruvate, ATP, bicarbonate phosphate different ATP/ADP ratios medium calculated. ATP/ADP ratios maintained steady state creatine kinase plus creatine phosphoryl acceptor. calculations revealed adding increasing concentrations creatine 20 mM energy dissipated mitochondria decreased showed local maximum 13mM creatine. Omission bicarbonate medium led shift maximum. energy dissipation minimal overall P/O ratio maximal. amount energy dissipated paralleled magnitude pH gradient across inner membrane. results concluded recycling H+ ions consists passive leakage H+ ions matrix active extrusion ions compartment, important energy dissipating process. H+ ion recycling thus one processes give rise state 4 respiration mitochondria.
