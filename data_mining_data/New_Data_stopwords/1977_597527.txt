 Increased serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity sometimes found acutely psychotic patients. order study factors affecting CPK activity, investigated normal subjects effect serum CPK activity resistance restrained struggle leather limb restraints (LLR) sometimes used control assaultive self-destructive behavior psychiatric patients. Blood samples obtained 24 hr immediately restraint; immediately, 6, 24, 48, 72 hr restraint. Serum CPK activity increases ranged 3 16 times base line levels subjects. increases exceeded 95% upper limit normal. Serum pyruvate kinase (PK) activity also increased significantly. second study, five male subjects passively placed LLR struggled LLR 1 hr. Serum CPK activity also increased significantly conditions, less forcibly restrained. Serum PK activity lactic dehydrogenase activity also increased significantly, serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) activity not. Since serum CPK activity increased well normal limits normal subjects struggle LLR, studies serum CPK activity psychotic patients must avoid use restraints well types trauma, may produce serum CPK increases persisting long 72 hr.
