 Cross-reactions anti-human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (HCG-beta) antibody elicited HCG-beta based antifertility vaccines autoantigens may occur due identical homologous protein subsequences. detected hitherto unreported identity HCG-beta sequence tetrapeptides PECAM-1, galactosyl transferase-associated protein kinase, insulin receptor-related receptor carboxypeptidase E. predicted potential epitope C-terminal peptide (CTP) HCG-beta identical tetrapeptide stretch MCSF-1. first 30 residue stretch CTP found yet unknown homologies 56% many auto-antigens including 60.1% centromere protein C. last 30 residue stretch CTP found first time 61.4-65.4% homology subsequences autoantigens SP-100, PM-SCL, D1 (64 kDa), lupus KU (p86), small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated proteins N, B B', major centromere autoantigen B, centromere protein C, dihydrolipoamide acetyl transferase component E2 pyruvate, respectively.
