 Treatment rats hypoglycaemic doses hypoglycin shown abolish relative detritiation [2-3H,U-14C]glucose [Osmundsen, Billington, Taylor & Sherratt (1978) Biochem. J. 170, 337-342], indicating Cori glucose/glucose 6-phosphate cycles inhibited vivo. inhibition confirmed and, addition, shown conversion vivo [14C]lactate [14C]fructose glucose decreased hypoglycin treatment. results suggest hypoglycin poisoning results inhibition vivo glucose-6-phosphatase activity, participates overall inhibition gluconeogenesis hypoglycaemia. Clofibrate feeding apparently protected rats inhibition fructose-to-glucose conversion hypoglycin. However, isolated hepatocytes prepared hypoglycin-treated rats, conversion [14C]fructose glucose recycling [2-3H,U-14C]glucose different control hepatocytes. suggests inhibition lost preparation hepatocytes. direct measurement glucose-6-phosphatase activity showed inhibited measured concentrated, dilute, homogenates prepared hypoglycin-treated rats.
