 isolated mouse homologue cDNA pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4 (PDK4) differential mRNA display up-regulated gene hypertrophied ventricles juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mice systemic carnitine deficiency. PDK4 mRNA level 5 times higher JVS mice control mice fed conditions. 24 h starvation, level increased 20 times JVS 7 times control, compared control fed level. hand, carnitine administration reduced high level PDK4 mRNA JVS mice control fed level. control mice, change PDK4 mRNA inversely correlated change PDH activity. JVS mice, however, PDK4 mRNA level always correlated active-form PDH level.
