 INTRODUCTION: McArdle's disease disorder muscle energy metabolism caused deficit muscle phosphorylase. typical form presents fatigability muscle cramps pains triggered physical exercise. cases symptoms. report case 14 year old girl diagnosed finding significantly raised CPK, studied following complaint fatigability. CLINICAL CASE: 14 year old girl presented CPK 1,243 UI/l (normal 10-32) requested view fatigability. never cramps, muscle pains dark urine. Neurological examination normal. levels CPK intense exercise previous days 7,459 UI/l, rest one week 283 UI/l (normal 25-230). ischemic exercise test showed unable finish test, flat lactate pyruvate curves markedly raised ammonia (basal 89 maximum 571 micrograms/dl). muscle biopsy, morphology striated muscle seen normal staining myophosphorylase negative. CONCLUSIONS: fluctuations muscle enzyme levels relation exercise orientate diagnosis towards disorder muscle energy metabolism. detect this, investigation carried following severe exercise several days compared test days rest. ischemic exercise test permits identification defects glycogenolysis, orientating choice suitable histochemical, enzymatic molecular biological tests.
