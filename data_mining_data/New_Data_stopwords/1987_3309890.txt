 homogeneous nucleic acid hybridization assay conducted solution requires separation steps described. assay based concept strand displacement. strand displacement assay, RNA "signal strand" hybridized within larger DNA strand termed "probe strand", is, turn, complementary target nucleic acid interest. Hybridization target nucleic acid probe strand ultimately results displacement RNA signal strand. Strand displacement, therefore, causes conversion RNA double single-stranded form. single-strand specificity polynucleotide phosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.8) allows discrimination double-helical single-stranded forms RNA signal strand. displacement proceeds, free RNA signal strands preferentially phosphorolyzed component nucleoside diphosphates, including adenosine diphosphate. latter nucleotide converted ATP pyruvate kinase(EC 2.7.1.40). Luciferase catalyzed bioluminescence employed measure ATP generated result strand displacement.
