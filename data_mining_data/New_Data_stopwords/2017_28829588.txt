 Apigenin (AP), anticancer agent, widely explored. However, molecular targets apigenin tumor metabolism unclear. Herein, found AP could block cellular glycolysis restraining tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activity expression significantly induce anti-colon cancer effects. IC50 values AP HCT116, HT29, DLD1 cells 27.9 +/- 2.45, 48.2 +/- 3.01 89.5 +/- 4.89 muM, respectively. Fluorescence spectra solid-phase AP extraction assays proved AP could directly bind PKM2 markedly inhibit PKM2 activity vitro HCT116 cells. Interestingly, presence d-fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FBP), inhibitory effect AP PKM2 reversed, suggests AP new allosteric inhibitor PKM2. RT-PCR Western blot assays showed AP could ensure low PKM2/PKM1 ratio HCT116 cells via blocking beta-catenin/c-Myc/PTBP1 signal pathway. Hence, PKM2 represents novel potential target AP colon cancer.
