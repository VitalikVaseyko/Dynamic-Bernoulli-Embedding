 Crude extracts vegetative cells glycerol-induced microcysts Myxococcus xanthus contained following enzyme activities: phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, fructosediphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphopyruvate carboxylase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase, uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase. exception isocitrate dehydrogenase, present fivefold higher concentration microcysts, activities extracts types cells essentially equal. Hexokinase pyruvate kinase could detected extracts either type cell. Microcysts metabolized acetate lower rate vegetative cells. decrease reflected substantial decrease ability microcysts oxidize acetate CO(2). addition, microcysts vegetative cells showed different distribution (14)C-label incorporated acetate.
