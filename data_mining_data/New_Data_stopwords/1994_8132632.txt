 L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene slightly active normal tumoral endocrine pancreatic tissues while, vivo, gene transcribed exocrine pancreas. Nevertheless, L-PK gene re-expressed low level cultured 266.6 cells derived exocrine pancreas carcinoma. L-PK gene early activated endodermal tissues, e.g. yolk sac primitive intestine; remains transcribed fetal pancreas. adult, L-PK gene expression restricted endocrine cells. Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1 HNF4 main tissue-restricted transcription factors involved tissue-specific expression L-PK gene. HNF1 concentration similar liver pancreatic cells. HNF4 concentration high liver, much lower islets Langerhans, endocrine pancreatic tumors, cultured insulinoma cells, scarcely detectable adult exocrine pancreas. distribution HNF4 parallels expression L-PK gene. vivo footprinting experiments show HNF1 binding site similarly occupied adult liver adult pancreas, gene practically inactive. latter tissue, however, HNF4 binding site differently occupied respect liver. Since chromatin structure remains open around L-PK promoter pancreas, L-PK gene probably re-expressed certain circumstances, instance cancerous pancreatic cells.
