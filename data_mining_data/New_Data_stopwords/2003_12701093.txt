 goal study identify important variables affecting bioluminescent ATP, ADP AMP measurements plasma develop assay takes variables account. Blood samples drawn conscious dogs. 'stop solution' containing EDTA prepared, greatly retarded plasma ATP degradation chelating Mg(+2) Ca(+2) co-factors many ATPases. Stop solution blood mixed using two-syringe withdrawal system. Samples centrifuged twice order remove red blood cells, ATP measured supernatant using firefly luciferase assay. Sample pH adjusted optimal range (7.75-7.95) Mg(2+) (necessary luciferase reaction) added back sample within luminometer 2 prior luciferase addition. Four assay tubes prepared plasma sample, containing standard additions 0-15 pmol added ATP, order quantify native plasma ATP content. separate plasma/stop solution samples ADP + ATP measured converting ADP ATP via pyruvate kinase reaction, AMP + ADP + ATP measured addition myokinase pyruvate kinase. Addition forskolin isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) stop solution inhibit platelets resulted lower ATP concentrations. Measurement ATP haemoglobin lysed erythrocytes revealed haemolysis exerts strong influence plasma ATP concentration must taken account.
