 Four isolipidic isoenergetic diets different protein:carbohydrate (CH) contents (48:38, 52:34, 56:30, 60:26) fed juvenile Senegalese sole (22.01 (sem 0.01) g) 104 d. Oral glucose tolerance tests performed beginning (4 d) end (104 d) experiment assess effect dietary treatment glucose tolerance. Samples blood, liver muscle dietary groups also obtained initial final phases trial different postprandial times (0, 1, 5 10 h feeding) order analyse glucose NEFA plasma, metabolites enzyme activities involved glycogen metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis lipogenesis pathways liver muscle. results obtained study suggest good glucose tolerance Senegalese sole. species tolerated important amounts CH diet without showing deleterious signs terms growth metabolic disorders. 104 feeding diets important amount CH (48:38 52:34), control glycaemia maintained even postprandial glucose levels plasma (in general) lower beginning experiment. reasonable tolerance glucose also reflected increased use glucose glycolysis liver (indicated glucokinase activity), absence changes lipogenic potential tissue (indicated ATP citrate lyase activity). clear changes induced muscle dietary treatments.
