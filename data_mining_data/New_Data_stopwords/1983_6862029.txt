 Brown-adipose tissue mitochondria hamster rat contain phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32). presence ketoglutarate malate, phosphoenolpyruvate formed exported mitochondria. Phosphoenolpyruvate formation inhibited 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate. proposed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase together pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase forms phosphoenolpyruvate shuttle energy produced Krebs cycle mitochondria may exported cytosol.
