 plants, hydrogen gas (H2) enhances tolerance several abiotic stresses, including salinity heavy metals. However, effect H2 fungal growth different stresses remains largely unclear. study, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) employed characterize physiological roles molecular mechanisms H2 alleviation three different stresses basidiomycete Hypsizygus marmoreus. results showed HRW treatment, H2 concentration 0.8 mM, significantly reduced toxicities CdCl2, NaCl H2O2, leading significantly improved mycelial growth biomass. beneficial effects could attributed significantly decreased formation malondialdehyde (MDA). Besides, HRW treatment significantly increased activities antioxidants (SOD, CAT GR) well gene expressions antioxidants (SOD, CAT, GR) mRNA level. vivo detection reactive oxygen species (ROS), including H2O2 O2(-), well lipid peroxidation provided evidence HRW could significantly improve tolerances CdCl2, NaCl H2O2. Furthermore, pyruvate kinase activated mycelia treated HRW, along induced gene expression, suggesting HRW treatment enhanced glucose metabolism. Taken together, findings suggested usage HRW could effective approach contaminant detoxification H. marmoreus, similar effects HRW plants, effects could also beneficial entire agricultural system.
