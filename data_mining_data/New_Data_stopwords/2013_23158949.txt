 OBJECTIVE: determine ameliorative potentials Syzygium jambolanum (SJ) extract L6 skeletal muscle cells regard arsenic-induced impairment optimum glucose homeostasis improper functioning mitochondria. METHODS: Several study parameters like glucose level mitochondrial functioning indexes pyruvate kinase, glucokinase mitochondrial membrane potential assessed. expression relevant marker proteins mRNAs like glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), IRS2 glucokinase tracking signalling cascade critically analyzed. RESULTS: Introduction SJ extract could bring positive modulation various markers, acting GLUT4, thereby bringing attenuation arsenite-induced toxic conditions L6 cells. CONCLUSION: Syzygium jambolanum extract considerable ameliorating potentials arsenic-induced glucose imbalance stress possibility therapeutic use management arsenic-induced toxicity including hyperglycemia.
