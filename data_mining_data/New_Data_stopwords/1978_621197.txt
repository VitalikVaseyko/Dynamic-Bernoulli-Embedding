 Rat hepatic pyruvate kinase (type L) purified homogeneity simple, rapid procedure involving DEAE-cellulose chromatography elution blue Sepharose column. enzyme homogeneous criteria sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis, subunit molecular weight 57,000, specific activity 558 units/mg protein 30 degrees. order test whether enzyme phosphorylated vivo, rats injected radioactive inorganic phosphate. Incorporation pyruvate kinase determined purification enzyme homogeneity well specific immunoprecipitation enzyme partially purified preparations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis revealed 32P incorporated enzyme cases. Glucagon administration vivo resulted 200 300% increase incorporation 32P enzyme correlated inhibition enzyme activity elevation hepatic levels cyclic AMP. results represent first demonstration vivo phosphorylation hepatic glycolytic enzyme strongly support hypothesis glucagon regulates pyruvate kinase activity, least part, phosphorylation mechanism.
