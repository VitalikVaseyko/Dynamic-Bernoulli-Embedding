 Electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) related pulse technique pulse field sweep EPR (PFSEPR) used probe site environment Mn2+ oxalate-ATP complex pyruvate kinase. Assignment features estimate hyperfine couplings shown proximity protons metal ions dipolar interaction proximity 31P 17O contact interaction direct Mn(2+)-ligand covalent spin transfer. Since Mn2+ spin5/2 ion whose Ms = +/- 1/2, +/- 3/2, +/- 5/2 electron spin states contribute EPR ENDOR, developed experimental theoretical strategies elucidating hyperfine couplings Mn2+ electron spin states. Solvent-exchangeable proton ENDOR features evident couplings similar hyperfine couplings H2O [Mn(H2O)6]2+. ENDOR exchangeable, distant protons originated dipolar coupling could expected protons residing 5.5 Mn2+ hydrogen-bonded nonliganding oxygen nitrogen. Nonexchangeable proton ENDOR features indicated dipolar coupling proton(s) protein residing approximately 4.5 Mn2+. approximately 4-MHz 31P phosphate hyperfine couplings Mn(II)-nucleotide models pyruvate kinase similar, detailed ENDOR PFSEPR comparison revealed hyperfine coupling ATP gamma-phosphate pyruvate kinase approximately 10% less coupling phosphates Mn(II)-nucleotides.
