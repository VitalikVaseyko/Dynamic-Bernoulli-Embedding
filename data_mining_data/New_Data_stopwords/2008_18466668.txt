 Although atypical antipsychotics widely known induce alterations lipid glucose metabolism, mechanisms alterations occur remain unknown. Several recent studies shown atypical antipsychotics induce oxidative stress oxidative cell injury increasing levels lipid protein oxidation. study, novel proteomic approach used identify specific proteins oxidized clozapine treatment. Differentiated neuroblastoma SKNSH cells treated 0, 5 20 mum clozapine 24 h protein extracts labelled 6-iodoacetamide fluorescein (6-IAF). lack incorporation 6-IAF cysteine residues indicator protein oxidation. Labelled proteins exposed 2D electrophoresis, differential protein labelling assessed. Increased oxidation clozapine treatment observed 10 protein spots (p<0.05), although four remained significant correcting analysis two drug concentrations. Five proteins, corresponding nine spots, identified HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) mitochondrial ribosomal protein S22, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, calumenin, pyruvate kinase 3-oxoacid CoA transferase. latter four proteins play important roles energy metabolism. results suggest oxidative stress may mechanism antipsychotics increase risk metabolic syndrome diabetes.
