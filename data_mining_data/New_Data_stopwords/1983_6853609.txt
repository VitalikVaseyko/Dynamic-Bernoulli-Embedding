 HeLa cells, injected radioiodinated proteins fusion RBC ghosts, exposed inhibitors lysosomal proteolysis autophagy. degradation injected [125I]bovine serum albumin (BSA) unaffected chloroquine, NH4Cl, nocodazole, colcemid, puromycin, cycloheximide, enucleation. Although degradation [125I]lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [125I]pyruvate kinase (PK) inhibited one-third chloroquine ammonia, degradation unaffected compounds. contrast, enhanced degradation 125I-PK resulting depriving injected HeLa cells amino acids serum inhibited 70% colcemid abolished chloroquine ammonia. Similarly, degradation [14C]sucrose-labeled BSA-polylysine conjugates entered HeLa cells endocytosis inhibited much 80% chloroquine ammonia. Sensitivity enhanced proteolysis degradation exogenous proteins ammonia chloroquine indicates effective inhibitors lysosomal proteolysis HeLa cells. Failure ammonia chloroquine inhibit degradation injected 125I-BSA modest inhibition degradation injected 125I-LDH 125I-PK indicates virtually BSA molecules PK LDH molecules degraded nonlysosomal proteolytic system. Components degradative system present vast excess long lived, since inhibition protein synthesis 20 hr effect degradation injected proteins.
