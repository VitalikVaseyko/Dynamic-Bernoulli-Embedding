 wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fructose-6-P known much lower amounts needed saturate fructose-6-P 1-kinase vitro, true mutant reduced affinity fructose-6-P, even though vivo fructose-6-P concentration much higher normal. wild type mutant fructose-6-P 1-kinases activated vitro fructose-2,6-P2 0.1 microM concentration range, effector present adequate amounts. Hence, likely necessary sufficient flux fructose-6-P 1-kinase reaction vivo, data also fit fructose-2,6-P2 acting different sites enzyme fructose-6-P. growth glucose, variety wild type strains contained 5-10 microM fructose-2,6-P2, various fructose-6-P 1-kinase mutant strains levels 150 microM presence glucose. Fructose-2,6-P2 also found (0.5-10 microM) derepressed cultures glucose exhaustion growth pyruvate. Activities fructose-6-P 2-kinase various strains situations also presented. data generally indicate correlation levels fructose-2,6-P2 fructose-6-P suggest fructose-2,6-P2 rapidly degraded glucose exhaustion.
