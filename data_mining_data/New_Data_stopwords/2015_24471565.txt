 CONTEXT: Proliferating cells reprogram cellular glucose metabolism meet bioenergetic biosynthetic demands maintain cellular redox homeostasis. Pyruvate kinase (PKM) critical regulator metabolic reprogramming. However, whether estradiol-17beta (E2) reprograms cellular metabolism support proliferation human primary endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) molecular basis reprogramming well understood. OBJECTIVES: objectives study whether E2 induces reprogramming glucose metabolism hESCs investigate potential roles PKM2 E2-induced metabolic reprogramming proliferation cells. METHODS: oxygen consumption rate extracellular acidification rate assessed Seahorse XF24 analyzer. PKM2 expression assessed real-time RT-PCR immunoblotting. RESULTS: E2 induces Warburg-like glucose metabolism hESCs inducing expression PKM. E2 also enhanced PKM splicing PKM2 isoform upregulating c-Myc-hnRNP axis. Furthermore, E2 induces PKM2 oxidation, phosphorylation, nuclear translocation. addition glycolytic function, PKM2 physically interacted estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) functioned ERalpha coactivator. Small-molecule PKM2 activators ameliorated ERalpha transcriptional activity abrogated E2-induced hESC proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: show first time E2-induced hESC proliferation associated shift glucose metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis, molecular basis metabolic shift linked effects E2 PKM2. addition, PKM2 acts transcriptional coactivator ERalpha small-molecule PKM2 activators inhibit ERalpha transcriptional activity reduce E2-induced cell proliferation.
