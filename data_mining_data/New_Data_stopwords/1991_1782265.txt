 Regulation respiration rates State 4 State 3 studied heart mitochondria oxidizing FAD- NAD-dependent substrates (succinate, pyruvate + + malate palmitoylcarnitine). creatine phosphokinase ADP-regenerating system used allows fix concentrations extramitochondrial adenine nucleotides way rate respiration controlled mitochondrial processes alone. shown respiration controlled delta mu(H+)-utilizing system within respiration rate interval State 4 till 70-80% maximal rate State 3 (corresponding physiological rates) NAD- FAD-dependent substrates. main step control respiration near State 4 proton leakage inner mitochondrial membrane, whereas parts mentioned interval role assigned adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). control coefficient ANT higher, proton leakage lower relative rates respiration NAD-dependent substrates compared succinate. differences found related much higher values membrane potential generated relative rates succinate oxidation comparison case pyruvate + + malate. contribution delta mu(H+)-utilizing system respiration control sharply decreases, whereas delta mu(H+)-generating system increases maximal rates respiration near State 3. phenomenon characteristic succinate. case control coefficient ANT drops zero, succinate dehydrogenase rises 0.7.
