 Meat quality development highly influenced pH decline caused postmortem (PM) glycolysis. Protein phosphorylation important mechanism regulating activity glycometabolic enzymes. Here, gel-based phosphoproteomic study performed analyze protein phosphorylation sarcoplasmic proteins three groups pigs different pH decline rates PM 1 24 h. Globally, fast pH decline group highest phosphorylation level PM 1 h, lowest 24 h, whereas slow pH decline group showed reverse case. pattern also observed individual bands 1-DE. protein phosphorylation levels 12 bands significantly affected synergy effects pH time (p<0.05). Protein identification revealed phosphoproteins glycometabolism-related enzymes, others involved stress response, phosphocreatine metabolism, functions. phosphorylation pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase-1 showed related PM muscle pH decline rate. work sheds light potential role protein phosphorylation regulating meat quality development.
