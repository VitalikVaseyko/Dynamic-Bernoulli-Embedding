 Warburg effect--a classical hallmark cancer metabolism--is counter-intuitive phenomenon rapidly proliferating cancer cells resort inefficient ATP production via glycolysis leading lactate secretion, instead relying primarily efficient energy production mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, normal cells do. causes Warburg effect remained subject considerable controversy since discovery 80 years ago, several competing hypotheses. Here, utilizing genome-scale human metabolic network model accounting stoichiometric enzyme solvent capacity considerations, show Warburg effect direct consequence metabolic adaptation cancer cells increase biomass production rate. analysis shown accurately capture three phase metabolic behavior observed experimentally oncogenic progression, well prominent characteristic cancer cells involving preference glutamine uptake amino acids.
