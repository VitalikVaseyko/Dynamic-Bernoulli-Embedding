 Context: Many biological pathways involved regulating substrate metabolism display rhythmic oscillation patterns. rodents, clock genes regulate circadian rhythms metabolic genes substrate metabolism. However, interrelationships among substrate metabolism, metabolic genes, clock genes fully explored people. Objective: tested hypothesis diurnal expression pattern pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), key metabolic enzyme involved fuel switching glucose free fatty acids (FFAs), associated plasma FFA concentration clock genes. Design Methods: analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), subcutaneous adipose tissue, plasma samples obtained serially 24 hours metabolically healthy women (n = 10) evaluated interrelationships among PDK4, plasma FFA, clock genes. also determined potential mechanisms responsible PDK4 transcriptional regulation using primary human PBMCs adipocytes. Results: found PDK4 diurnal expression patterns similar PBMCs adipose tissue (rho = 0.84, P < 0.001). diurnal variation PBMC PDK4 expression correlated strongly plasma FFA insulin (rho = 0.86 0.63, respectively, P < 0.001) concentrations clock genes. Data obtained primary culture experiments demonstrated FFAs directly induced PDK4 gene expression, least part activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Conclusions: results suggest plasma FFA availability important regulator diurnal expression patterns PDK4, identify novel interaction plasma FFA cellular diurnal rhythms regulating substrate metabolism.
