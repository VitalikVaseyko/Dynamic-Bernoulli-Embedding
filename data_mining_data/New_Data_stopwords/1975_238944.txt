 nonglycolytic, anaerobic organism Veillonella parvula M4 shown contain active pyruvate kinase. enzyme purified 126-fold shown disc-gel electrophoresis contain two faint contaminating bands. purified enzyme pH optimum 7.0 forward direction exhibited sigmoidal kinetics varying concentrations o-f phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), Mg-2+ ions S0.5 values 1.5, 2.0, 2.4 mM, respectively. Substrate inhibition observed 4 PEP. Hill plots gave slope values (n) 4.4 (PEP), 2.8 (adenosine 5'-diphosphate), 2.0 (Mg-2+), indicating high degree cooperativity. enzyme inhibited non-competitively adenosine 5'-triphosphate (Ki = 3.4 mM), inhibition slightly affected increasing concentration Mg-2+ ions 30 mM. Competitive inhibition observed 3-phosphoglycerate, malate, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate higher inhibitor concentrations. enzyme activated glucose-6-phosphate (P), fructose-6-P, fructose-1,6-diphosphate (P2), dihydroxyacetone-P, AMP; Hill coefficients 2.2, 1.8, 1.5, 2.1, 2.0, respectively. presence metabolites caused substrate velocity curves change sigmoidal hyperbolic curves, accompanied increase maximum activity, e.g., AMP greater fructose-1,6-P2 greater dihydroxyacetone-P greater glucose-6-P greater fructose-6-P. activation constants fructose-1,6-P2, AMP, glucose-6-P 0.3, 1.1, 5.3 mM, respectively. effect 5 mM fructose-1,6-P2 significantly different compounds metabolite inhibitory 1.2 3 mM PEP. concentration, fructose-1,6-P2 activated enzyme abolished substrate inhibition PEP. enzyme affected glucose, glyceraldehyde-3-P, 2-phosphoglycerate, lactate, malate, fumerate, succinate, cyclic AMP. results suggest pyruvate kinase V. parvula M4 plays central role control gluconeogenesis organism regulating concentration PEP.
