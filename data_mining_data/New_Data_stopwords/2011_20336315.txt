 PURPOSE: Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) key enzyme aerobic glycolysis; inhibition PKM2 leads tumor growth inhibition. study, effects combined treatment cisplatin (DDP) plasmid expresses short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PKM2 growth human A549 xenograft lung cancer model investigated. METHODS: expression PKM2 A549 cells determined immunofluorescence. PKM2 expression levels evaluated Western blot analysis. human A549 lung cancer xenograft model, effects treatment shRNA, without cisplatin, tumor volume determined. Apoptosis cell proliferation status examined determine mechanisms tumor growth inhibition. RESULTS: Expression shRNA targeting PKM2 resulted inhibition PKM2 expression A549 cells. lung cancer xenograft model, average tumor volume group treated cisplatin shRNA statistically lower groups (P < 0.05). levels apoptotic cells significantly higher samples animals combined treatment group untreated animals (P < 0.05). cell proliferation rate, determined counting cells labeled anti-phospho-histone H3, marker mitosis, lower samples animals treated cisplatin shRNA samples groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Use RNA interfering (RNAi) targeting PKM2 significantly inhibited tumor growth combined cisplatin human A549 lung cancer xenograft model. enhanced antitumor activity combined treatment compared treatment shRNA alone may result part increased induction apoptosis augmented inhibition cancer cell proliferation.
