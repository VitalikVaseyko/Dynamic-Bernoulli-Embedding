 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) integral basal-like human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2)-overexpressing breast cancers. tumors associated poor prognosis, majority express high levels EGFR. reported EGFR expression induced oncogenic transcription factor Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) occurs manner dependent phosphorylation Akt. Herein, questioned whether blocking Akt 2-amino-N-[4-[5-(2-phenanthrenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]phenyl]-ace tamide (OSU-03012), phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) small-molecule inhibitor, could prevent YB-1 binding EGFR promoter. MDA-MB-468 SUM 149 basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells used studies express high levels activated PDK-1, YB-1, EGFR compared immortalized breast epithelial cell line 184htrt. cell lines, YB-1 preferentially bound -1 kilobase EGFR promoter, whereas occur 184htrt cells based chromatin immunoprecipitation. cells exposed OSU-03012 6 h, YB-1/EGFR promoter binding significantly attenuated. confirm observation, gel-shift assays showed drug inhibits YB-1/EGFR promoter binding. inhibitory effect OSU-03012 EGFR also observed mRNA protein levels. OSU-03012 ultimately inhibited growth BLBC monolayer soft agar coordinate induction apoptosis using Array-Scan VTI high-content screening system. Furthermore, OSU-03012 inhibited expression EGFR 48% tumor xenografts derived MDA-MB-435/Her-2 cells. correlated loss YB-1 binding EGFR promoter. Hence, find OSU-03012 inhibits YB-1 resulting loss EGFR expression vitro vivo.
