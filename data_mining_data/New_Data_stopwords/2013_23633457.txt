 Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) hereditary cancer syndrome affected individuals risk development cutaneous uterine leiomyomas aggressive form type II papillary kidney cancer. HLRCC characterized germline mutation tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH). FH-deficient kidney cancer characterized impaired oxidative phosphorylation metabolic shift aerobic glycolysis, form metabolic reprogramming referred Warburg effect. Increased glycolysis generates ATP needed increased cell proliferation. FH-deficient kidney cancer, levels AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), cellular energy sensor, decreased resulting diminished p53 levels, decreased expression iron importer, DMT1, leading low cellular iron levels, enhanced fatty acid synthesis diminishing phosphorylation acetyl CoA carboxylase, rate-limiting step fatty acid synthesis. Increased fumarate decreased iron levels FH-deficient kidney cancer cells inactivate prolyl hydroxylases, leading stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha increased expression genes VEGF glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) provide fuel needed rapid growth demands. Several therapeutic approaches targeting metabolic basis FH-deficient kidney cancer development evaluated clinical trials, including use agents metformin, would reverse inactivation AMPK, approaches inhibit glucose transport, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), antioxidant response pathway, heme oxygenase pathway, approaches target tumor vasculature glucose transport agents bevacizumab erlotinib. types metabolic shifts, aerobic glycolysis decreased oxidative phosphorylation, found wide variety cancer types. Targeting metabolic basis rare cancer FH-deficient kidney cancer hopefully provide insights development effective forms therapies other, common forms cancer.
