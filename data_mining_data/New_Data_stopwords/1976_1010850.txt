 changes cellular concentrations ATP, ADP, AMP oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria investigated remaining liver partially hepatectomized rabbits. energy charge (defined half average number anhydride-bonded phosphate groups per adenosine moiety) liver remnant decreased 0.866 0.767 (p less 0.01) within 24 hr hepatectomy, increased substantially higher level normal within 7 days. hand, mitochondrial phosphyorylative activity increased rapidly 170 per cent control within 12 hr retruned normal within 7 days. mitochondrial phosphorylative activity inversely correlated energy charge liver remnant (r = -0.75, p less less 0.01). maximal enhancement mitochondrial phosphorylative activity found mitochondria obtained liver remnant lowest level energy charge, suggesting response mitochondria vivo involving enhanced biosynthetic ATP-utilizing reactions early stage regenerating process. enhancement phosphorylative activity accompanied rise respiratory control ratio, P/O ratio state 3 respiration. adenylate kinase [EC 2.7.4.3] activity liver remnant increased 160% control within 2 days partial hepatectomy, pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40] activity decreased remarkably. However, changes two enzyme activities correlate mitochondrial phosphorylative activity energy charge liver remnant.
