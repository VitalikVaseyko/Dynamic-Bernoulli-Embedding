 Hepatic carbohydrate metabolism genetically diabetic mice (db/db) normal littermates studied. db/db mice, body water normal declined age. liver db/db mice abnormally large relation metabolic mass body ages studied. db/db mice, hepatic glycogenolysis, glycogen synthesis, glycogen synthetase, phosphorylase markedly increased. Gluconeogenesis alanine lactate perfused livers db/db mice greater normal per 100 g body water. Activities fructose-1, 6-biophosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, glucokinase + hexokinase, pyruvate kinase elevated livers db/db mice. Diabetic mouse livers perfused lactate showed markedly reduced concentration P-enolpyruvate clear "forward crossover" fructose-1, 6-P2 fructose-6-P. vivo glucose clearance, measured [3-3H]glucose, db/db mice 170% normal mice. Data presented indicate livers db/db mice: 1) glucose production elevated prior hyperglycemia, 2) glycogen turns rapidly, 3) glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes elevated paradoxically. abnormalities discussed viewpoint etiology.
