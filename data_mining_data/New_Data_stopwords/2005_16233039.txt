 Polyphosphate-AMP phosphotransferase (PAP) polyphosphate kinase (PPK) used designing novel ATP regeneration system, named PAP-PPK ATP regeneration system. PAP enzyme catalyzes phospho-conversion AMP ADP, PPK catalyzes ATP formation ADP. enzymes use inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)] phosphate donor. PAP-PPK ATP regeneration system, ATP continuously synthesized AMP coupling reaction PAP PPK using poly(P). Poly(P) cheap material compared acetyl phosphate, phosphoenol pyruvate creatine phosphate, phosphate donors used conventional ATP regeneration systems. achieve efficient synthesis ATP AMP, excessive amount poly(P) added reaction solution PAP PPK consume poly(P) phosphate donor. Using ATP generation reaction, constructed PAP-PPK ATP regeneration system acetyl-CoA synthase succeeded synthesizing acetyl-CoA CoA, acetate AMP. Since much poly(P) may chelate MG2+ inhibit enzyme activity, Mg2+ concentration optimized 24 mM presence 30 mM poly(P) reaction. reaction, ATP regenerated 39.8 times AMP, 99.5% CoA converted acetyl-CoA. addition, since PAP-PPK ATP regeneration system regenerate GTP GMP, could also used GTP regeneration system.
