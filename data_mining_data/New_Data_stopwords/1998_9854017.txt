 Mammalian pyruvate kinase (PK), key glycolytic enzyme, two genes named PKL PKM, produce L- R-type isoenzymes means alternative promoters, M1-and M2-types mutually exclusive alternative splicing respectively. expression genes tissue-specific developmental, dietary hormonal control. L-type isoenzyme (L-PK) gene contains multiple regulatory elements necessary regulation 5' flanking region, position -170. L-II L-III elements required stimulation L-PK gene transcription carbohydrates glucose fructose, although L-III element responsive carbohydrates. L-II element also responsible gene regulation polyunsaturated fatty acids. Nuclear factor-1 proteins hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, bind L-II element, may also involved carbohydrate polyunsaturated fatty acid regulation L-PK gene respectively. However, L-III-element-binding protein involved carbohydrate regulation remains clarified, although involvement upstream stimulating factor proposed. Available evidence suggests carbohydrate signalling pathway L-PK gene includes glucose metabolite, possibly glucose 6-phosphate xylulose 5-phosphate, well phosphorylation dephosphorylation mechanisms. addition, least five regulatory elements identified 5' flanking region PKM gene position -279. Sp1-family proteins bind two proximal elements, binding proteins elements yet clarified. Glucose may stimulate transcription PKM gene via hexosamine derivatives. Sp1 may involved regulation via dephosphorylation, although carbohydrate response element determined precisely PKM gene. Thus glucose stimulates transcription PKM gene mechanism probably different L-PK gene.
