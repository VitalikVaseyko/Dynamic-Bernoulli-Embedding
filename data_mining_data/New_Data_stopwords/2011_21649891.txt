 1- Oncogenes express proteins "Tyrosine kinase receptor pathways", receptor family including insulin IGF-Growth Hormone receptors. oncogenes alter PP2A phosphatase brake kinases. 2- Experiments pancreatectomized animals; treated pure insulin total pancreatic extracts, showed choline extract, preserved hepatomas. Since choline methyle donor, since methylation regulates PP2A, choline protection may result PP2A methylation, attenuates kinases. 3- Moreover, kinases activated boosted signaling pathway inactivate pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase. addition, demethylated PP2A would longer dephosphorylate enzymes. "bottleneck" glycolysis oxidative-citrate cycle interrupts glycolytic pyruvate supply provided via proteolysis alanine transamination. pyruvate forms lactate (Warburg effect) NAD+ glycolysis. Lipolysis fatty acids provide acetyl CoA; citrate condensation increases, unusual oxaloacetate sources available. ATP citrate lyase follows, supporting aberrant transaminations glutaminolysis tumor lipogenesis. Truncated urea cycles, increased polyamine synthesis, consume methyl donor SAM favoring carcinogenesis. 4- decrease butyrate, histone deacetylase inhibitor, elicits epigenic changes (PETEN, P53, IGFBP decrease; hexokinase, fetal-genes-M2, increase). 5- IGFBP stops binding IGF - IGFR complex, perhaps longer inherited single mitotic daughter cell; leading two daughter cells mitotic capability. 6- excess IGF induces decrease major histocompatibility complex MHC1, Natural killer lymphocytes eliminate cells start tumor, unless fever prostaglandin PGE2 inflammation, inhibit them...
