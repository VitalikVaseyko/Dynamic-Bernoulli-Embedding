 Neurons cancer cells use glucose extensively, yet precise advantage adaptation remains unclear. two seemingly disparate cell types also show increased regulation apoptotic pathway, allows long-term survival. show neurons cancer cells strictly inhibit cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis mechanism dependent glucose metabolism. report pro-apoptotic activity cytochrome c influenced redox state increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) following apoptotic insult lead oxidation activation cytochrome c. healthy neurons cancer cells, however, cytochrome c reduced held inactive intracellular glutathione (GSH), generated result glucose metabolism pentose phosphate pathway. results uncover striking similarity apoptosis regulation neurons cancer cells provide insight adaptive advantage offered Warburg effect cancer cell evasion apoptosis long-term neuronal survival.
