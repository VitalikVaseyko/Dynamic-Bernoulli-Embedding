 control points Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway germinating castor bean (Ricinus communis) endosperms sought two ways: (a) measuring amounts various glycolytic intermediates intervals germination; (b) determining crossover points appearing anoxia.A significant departure thermodynamic equilibrium substrates products found level fructose 1,6-diphosphatase phosphofructokinase. definite shift ratio observed onset active gluconeogenesis. concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate 3-phosphoglyceric acid increase time. Another departure expected equilibrium also observed level pyruvate kinase.The imposition anoxia 5-day-old endosperms reveals two crossover points, level enzymes. therefore concluded regulate glycolytic flow.The maximal glycolytic flow, however, 1/10 gluconeogenic one. account high gluconeogenic efficiency, postulated gluconeogenesis glycolysis occur separate intracellular regions. consistent departure equilibrium adenylates observed early stages anoxia supports concepts pools glycolytic gluconeogenic intermediates indeed compartmented two processes independently regulated.
