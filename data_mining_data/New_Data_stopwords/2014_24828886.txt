 number proposals made past century regarding may drive sporadic cancers initiate develop. Yet problem remains largely unsolved none proposals widely accepted cancer-initiation drivers. propose driver model initiation early development solid cancers associated inflammation-induced chronic hypoxia reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. model consists five key elements: (i)human cells tend substantial gap ATP demand supply chronic hypoxia, would inevitably lead increased uptake glucose accumulation metabolites; (ii) accumulation metabolites cast mounting pressure cells ultimately result production export hyaluronic acid; (iii) exported hyaluronic acid degraded fragments various sizes, serving tissue-repair signals, including signals cell proliferation, cell survival angiogenesis, lead initial proliferation underlying cells; (iv) cell division provides exit accumulated glucose metabolites using towards macromolecular synthesis new cell, hence alleviate pressure metabolite accumulation; (v) process continues long hypoxic condition persists. tandem, genetic mutations may selected make cell divisions hence survival sustainable efficient, also increasingly uncontrollable. model also applies hereditary cancers key mutations, BRCA breast cancer, generally lead increased ROS ultimately repression mitochondrial activities up-regulation glycolysis, well hypoxia; hence energy gap, glucose-metabolite accumulation, hyaluronic acid production continuous cell division survival.
