 renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays key pathogenic role heart failure. adverse effects angiotensin II (Ang II), major player RAS, contributes development heart failure. Heart failure accompanied significant perturbations cardiac energy metabolism decrease cardiac energy supply decrease cardiac efficiency. Recent evidence suggests Ang II might involved perturbations cardiac energy metabolism. Furthermore, new components RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 Ang1-7, reported exert beneficial effects cardiac energy metabolism. result, understanding relationship RAS cardiac energy metabolism potential improve control heart failure, may lead development new therapies treat heart failure. review summarizes effects RAS cardiac energy metabolism, highlighting Ang II induce cardiac insulin resistance mitochondrial damage, role reactive oxygen species sirtuins processes.
