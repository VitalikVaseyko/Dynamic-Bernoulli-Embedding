 Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (mtPDH) key respiratory enzyme links glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle, negatively regulated mtPDH kinase (mtPDHK). Arabidopsis lines carrying either constitutive seed-specific antisense construct mtPDHK used test hypothesis alteration mtPDH activity tissue- dosage-dependent manner enhance reproductive growth particularly elevated CO2 (EC) combined enhancement source sink activities. Constitutive transgenic lines showed increased mtPDH activity rosette leaves ambient CO2 (AC) EC, immature seeds EC. Seed-specific transgenic lines showed enhanced mtPDH activity immature seeds. strong relationship existed seed mtPDH activity inflorescence initiation AC, EC inflorescence stem growth, silique number seed harvest index strongly related seed mtPDH activity. Leaf photosynthetic rates showed increase rosette leaves transgenic lines AC EC correlated enhanced inflorescence initiation. Collectively, data show mtPDHK plays key role regulating sink source activities Arabidopsis particularly reproductive phase.
