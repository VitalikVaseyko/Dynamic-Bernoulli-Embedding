 Hepatocytes fasted, alloxan-diabetic rats incubated absence gluconeogenic substrates deplete residual glycogen stores. Glucose production lactate pyruvate enhanced cells diabetic rats relative similarly treated hepatocytes fasted, nondiabetic control rats. Gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone, fructose, glycerol increased formation lactate plus pyruvate dihydroxyacetone decreased. stimulation gluconeogenesis exogenous fatty acids decreased diabetes. rates gluconeogenesis presence lactate plus pyruvate plus oleate equal hepatocytes diabetic control rats indicate maximal rate gluconeogenesis increased. lactate plus pyruvate substrates, stimulation gluconeogenesis norepinephrine dibutyryl-cAMP altered diabetes. catecholamine stimulation gluconeogenesis glycerol also unaffected. contrast, diabetes decreased maximal stimulation gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone dibutyryl-cAMP, glucagon, norepinephrine decrease proportional decreased production lactate plus pyruvate. concentrations glucagon norepinephrine required half-maximal stimulation altered diabetes. Thus, hormonal stimulation gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone decreased diabetes, probably decreased pyruvate kinase activity, interaction glucagon norepinephrine hepatocytes subsequent stimulation gluconeogenesis physiologic substrates impaired.
