 Pyruvate kinase type M2, expressed multiple tumor cell types plays key role aerobic glycolysis, also nonglycolytic functions regulate transcription cell proliferation. results study show epidermal growth factor receptor activation induces pyruvate kinase type M2 nuclear translocation. determine relationship pyruvate kinase type M2 epidermal growth factor receptor, analyzed pathological data mammary glands performed epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 knockdown reveal pyruvate kinase type M2 associated epidermal growth factor receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Lapatinib small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, though effect pyruvate kinase type M2 remains elusive. Accordingly, performed Western blotting reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyzed pathological data mammary glands, results suggesting lapatinib inhibits pyruvate kinase type M2 expression. found antitumor drug lapatinib inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation influencing pyruvate kinase type M2 expression, based Cell Counting Kit-8 analyses pyruvate kinase type M2 overexpression experiments. Signal transducer activator transcription 3, transcription factor-associated cell proliferation transcription factor interacts pyruvate kinase type M2, performed pyruvate kinase type M2 knockdown experiments Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 Human breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 cell lines examined effect levels Signal transducer activator transcription 3 phosphorylated Signal transducer activator transcription 3. results indicate pyruvate kinase type M2 regulates Signal transducer activator transcription 3 phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) expression. Together previous reports, findings show lapatinib inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation influencing pyruvate kinase type M2 expression, results reduction Signal transducer activator transcription 3 phosphorylated Signal transducer activator transcription 3.
