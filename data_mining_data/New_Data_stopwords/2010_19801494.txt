 Diabetic cardiomyopathy important contributor diastolic systolic heart failure. examined nature mechanism cardiomyopathy Akita (Ins2(WT/C96Y)) mice, model genetic nonobese type 1 diabetes recapitulates human type 1 diabetes. Cardiac function evaluated male Ins2WT/C96Y littermate control (Ins2WT/WT) mice using echocardiography tissue Doppler imaging, vivo hemodynamic measurements, well ex vivo working heart preparation. 3 6 mo age, Ins2WT/C96Y mice exhibited preserved cardiac systolic function compared Ins2WT/WT mice, evaluated ejection fraction, fractional shortening, left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure maximum rate increase LV pressure vivo, cardiac work, cardiac power, rate-pressure product ex vivo. Despite unaltered systolic function, Ins2WT/C96Y mice exhibited significant progressive diastolic dysfunction 3 6 mo age compared Ins2WT/WT mice assessed tissue pulse Doppler imaging (E-wave velocity, isovolumetric relaxation time) vivo hemodynamic measurements (LV end-diastolic pressure, time constant LV relaxation, maximum rate decrease LV pressure). found evidence myocardial hypertrophy fibrosis Ins2WT/C96Y myocardium. Consistent lack fibrosis, expression procollagen-alpha type I, procollagen-alpha type III, fibronectin increased hearts. Ins2WT/C96Y hearts showed significantly reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump) levels, elevated beta-myosin heavy chain isoform, increased long-chain fatty acids, triacylglycerol evidence lipotoxicity, indicated significant rise ceramide, diacylglycerol, lipid deposits myocardium. Consistent metabolic perturbation, switch fatty acid oxidation glucose oxidation Ins2WT/C96Y hearts, expression mitochondrial long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 increased. Insulin treatment reversed diastolic dysfunction, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide beta-myosin heavy chain, reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a levels abolition cardiac lipotoxicity. conclude early type 1 diabetic cardiomyopathy characterized diastolic dysfunction associated lipotoxic cardiomyopathy preserved systolic function absence interstitial fibrosis hypertrophy.
