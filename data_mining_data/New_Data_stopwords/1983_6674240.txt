 Serum pyruvate kinase creatine kinase activities measured group patients various neuromuscular diseases carriers muscular dystrophy. Elevated values PK usually invariably associated elevated levels CK. data showed PK activity elevated patients DMD, high values generally correlating inversely age disease duration. definite carriers, level PK raised simultaneously CK, potential carriers, classified relationship MD patients mothers, sisters relatives, PK levels elevated 23%, 44% 10% respectively, indicating especially sisters, increased genetic probability definite carrier. way, confirmed serum PK assay sensitive younger subjects combined CK PK measurement value detecting higher proportion potential carriers.
