 OBJECTIVE: term benign congenital hypotonia retrospective refers infants hypotonic birth shortly thereafter later show normal tone. encompasses many different pathological processes affect brain, motor unit, both. majority affected children cerebral hypotonia. increased incidence mental retardation, learning disabilities, sequelae cerebral abnormality evident later life, despite recovery normal muscle tone. followed floppy infants pointed showing motor delay health examinations 4 9 months age least 2 years age. METHODS: selected 32 floppy infants (15 males 17 females) born uneventfully, family history, major anomalies, abnormal findings brain imaging, chromosomal study (G-banding fluorescence situ hybridization), serum creatine kinase level, blood lactate pyruvate level, blood amino acid abnormalities. RESULTS: 32 infants achieved head control, 2 failed learn sit unsupported. two diagnosed based gene analysis Rett syndrome spinal muscular atrophy, respectively. Although 27 among 32 patients became ambulant, 18 (67%) showed mental retardation 5 (19%) also autism spectrum disorder. Five patients could walk suspected congenital myopathy congenital malformation syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: learning walk independently recovery normal muscle tone, many floppy infants showing motor delay health examinations 4 9 months age developed mental retardation autism spectrum disorder. Prospective follow-up necessary early diagnosis intervention. patients showing motor mental development, laboratory studies including appropriate gene analysis important definite diagnosis.
