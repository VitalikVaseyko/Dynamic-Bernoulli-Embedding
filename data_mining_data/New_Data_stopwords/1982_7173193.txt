 Hydrosoluble polymers NAD+ ADP synthesized according described method modifications. cofactor bound matrix spacer group five atoms exocyclic adenine C-6 amino group. Cofactor incorporations high. loading NAD+ polymers were: 420 mumol NAD+/g polymer 330 mumol ADP ribose/g polymer arising degradation NAD+; loading ADP polymers were: 1.40 1.43 mmol ADP/g polymer. polymer obtained polymerization step fractionated two parts gel filtration manner two parts framework different molecular weights. biological properties fractionated polymers compared. small sized polymers NAD+, assayed four dehydrogenases, reduced enzymatically larger ones higher reduction rates relative free NAD+. coupled system (L-lactate dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase) coenzyme regeneration, rate production L-lactate steady state system using NAD+ polymers small size 80% system using free NAD+. small-sized polymers ADP phosphorylated pyruvate kinase creatine kinase larger ones. relative rates transformation pyruvate kinase large sized polymers higher smaller ones.
