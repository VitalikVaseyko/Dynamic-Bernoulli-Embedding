 Pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) isozymes purified: type M1 M2 isozymes rat, mouse rabbit, type M1 bull frog type L rat mouse. amino acid composition type M1 M2 isozymes various species similar type L isozymes rat mouse also similar. NH2-terminals type M1 M2 rat mouse (Pro-Lys-Pro-), enzymes appeared blocked. COOH-terminals type M1 M2 rat, mouse rabbit (-Val-Pro). Comparison tryptic peptide maps type M1 M2 rat, mouse rabbit indicated type M1 M2 could produced post-synthesis modification, could encoded different type-specific mRNAs. Comparative studies type M1 M2 different species showed type M1-specific peptide spots highly variable, whereas type M2-specific peptide spots highly conserved. type L isozyme showed marked species variation, indicating differentiated isozyme evolved rapidly type M2, may prototype undifferentiated isozyme.
