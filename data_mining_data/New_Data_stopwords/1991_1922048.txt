 regulation glycolytic genes response carbon source yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae studied. relative levels glycolytic mRNA compared exponential growth glucose lactate, various glycolytic mRNAs found induced differing extents glucose. significant differences stabilities PFK2, PGK1, PYK1, PDC1 mRNAs growth glucose lactate observed. PYK::lacZ PGK::lacZ fusions integrated independently yeast genome ura3 locus. manner fusions differentially regulated response carbon source similar respective wild-type loci. Therefore, regulation glycolytic mRNA levels mediated transcriptional level. mRNAs ordered respect glycolytic pathway, two peaks maximal induction observed phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. enzymes (i) catalyze two essentially irreversible steps pathway, (ii) two glycolytic enzymes circumvented gluconeogenesis hence specific glycolysis, (iii) encoded mRNAs shown previously coregulated translational level S. cerevisiae (P. A. Moore, A. J. Bettany, A. J. P. Brown, NATO ASI Ser. Ser. H Cell Biol. 49:421-432, 1990). differential regulation glycolytic mRNA levels might therefore significant influence upon glycolytic flux S. cerevisiae.
