 AIM: investigate biological mechanisms underlying pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) regulation cell migration invasion hepatocellular carcinoma cells. METHODS: HepG2 Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines stably transfected cultured DMEM (HyClone, Logan, UT, United States). investigate effects PKM2 cellular proliferation, hepatocellular carcinoma cells subjected Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Kamimashiki-gun, Kumamoto, Japan). investigate effects PKM2 cell signal pathway related migration invasion, Western immunoblotting used find differential proteins. antibody used purchaseed Cell Signal Technology. order explore cell motility used Transwell invasion wound healing assays. transwell plate 0.5 mg/mL collagen type (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA)-coated filters. wound-healing assay performed 6-well plates. Total RNA extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, United States) reverse transcription conducted. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis performed ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). use digital gene expression tag profiling identification differentially expressed genes. RESULTS: cells seeded four 96-well plates measured OD450 conducted Cell Counting Kit-8. conduction observed HepG2 Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells silenced PKM2 turn proliferate inhibition; however, cell migration invasion enhanced compared control upon stimulation epidermal growth factor (EGF). results indicate knockdown PKM2 decreased expression E-cadherin enhanced activity EGF/EGFR signaling pathway, furthermore up-regulate subsequent signal molecular PLCgamma1 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 expression hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2 Huh-7, regulates cell motility. variations observed due activation transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathway PKM2 knockdown. also found expression TGFBRI increased phosphorylation Smad2 enhanced. Taken together, findings demonstrate PKM2 regulate cell motility EGF/EGFR TGFbeta/TGFR signaling pathways hepatocellular carcinoma cells. CONCLUSION: PKM2 play different roles modulating proliferation metastasis hepatocellular carcinoma cells, finding could help guide future targeted therapies.
