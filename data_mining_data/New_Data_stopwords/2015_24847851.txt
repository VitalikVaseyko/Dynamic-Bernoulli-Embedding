 BACKGROUND: atmospheric CO2 concentration increases every year. effects elevated CO2 plant growth, physiology metabolism studied, pressing need understand molecular mechanisms plants respond future increases CO2 concentration using genomic techniques. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Gene expression triploid white poplar ((Populus tomentosa xP. bolleana) xP. tomentosa) leaves investigated using Affymetrix poplar genome gene chip, three months growth controlled environment chambers three CO2 concentrations. physiological findings showed growth, assessed stem diameter, significantly increased, net photosynthetic rate decreased elevated CO2 concentrations. concentrations four major endogenous hormones appeared actively promote plant development. Leaf tissues elevated CO2 concentrations 5,127 genes different expression patterns comparison leaves ambient CO2 concentration. Among these, 8 genes finally selected investigation using randomized variance model corrective ANOVA analysis, dynamic gene expression profiling, gene network construction, quantitative real-time PCR validation. Among 8 genes network, aldehyde dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase situated core interconnections genes. CONCLUSIONS: elevated CO2 concentrations, 8 significantly changed key genes involved metabolism responding stimulus external environment identified. genes play crucial roles signal transduction network show strong correlations elevated CO2 exposure. study provides several target genes, investigation could provide initial step better understanding molecular mechanisms plant acclimation evolution future rising CO2 concentrations.
