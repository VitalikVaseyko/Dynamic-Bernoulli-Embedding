 F1-ATPases mitochondria chloroplasts, tight binding Mg2+ ADP without Pi catalytic site reported cause enzyme inhibition. time dependence inhibition effect various agents process described (Du, Z., Boyer, P. D. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 402-407, references therein). Similar results reported ATPase Halobacterium saccharovorum. nonlinear hydrolysis kinetics modulated nitrate, azide, sulfite, GTP, ADP absence ATP, Pi characteristic ways, good analogy effects agents F1 enzymes. similarity F1 systems suggests tight ADP binding affected. Although reactions H. saccharovorum ATPase occurred different time concentration scales F1-ATPases, two systems appear fundamentally different. hydrolytic mechanism H. saccharovorum ATPase thus identifies enzyme member F0F1-ATPase family.
