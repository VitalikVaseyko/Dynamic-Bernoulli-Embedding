 Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis tandem mass spectrometry used identify proteins associated metabolic shift fed-batch cultures two recombinant antibody-producing CHO cell lines. first cell line underwent marked change lactate metabolism culture, initially producing lactate consuming it, second cell line produced lactate similar duration later consume it. first cell line displayed declining specific antibody productivity culture, correlating 2-D gel results intracellular antibody concentration determined HPLC. Several statistical analysis methods compared work, including fixed fold-change criterion t-tests using standard deviations determined several ways raw data mathematically transformed data. Application variance-stabilizing transformation enabled use global empirical standard deviation t-tests. protein spots changing cell line change significantly cell line. substantial fraction changing proteins glycolytic enzymes; others included proteins related antibody production, protein processing, cell structure. Enolase, pyruvate kinase, BiP/GRP78, protein disulfide isomerase found spots changed time cell lines, protein changes differed previous reports. data provide foundation future investigation metabolism industrially relevant mammalian cell culture processes, suggest along differences cell types, proteins expressed cultures low lactate concentrations may depend conditions generated.
