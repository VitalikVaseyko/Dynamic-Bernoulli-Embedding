 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient red blood cells (RBCs) known susceptible oxidant-induced hemolysis. Erythrocytes G6PD-deficient individuals significantly susceptible Ca(2+)-induced vesiculation normal control cells. enhanced susceptibility G6PD-deficient RBCs Ca(2+)-induced vesiculation due ATP depletion. remnant G6PD-deficient RBCs following vesiculation sensitive complement-mediated hemolysis control normal RBCs. strong positive correlation exists level Ca(2+)-induced vesiculation extent complement mediated hemolysis.
