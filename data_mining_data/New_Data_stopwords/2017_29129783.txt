 miR-214 important oncomiRNA upregulated various types cancer, including gastric cancer. However, molecular mechanism underlying ectopic expression function miR-214 gastric cancer largely undefined. study, found miR-214 induces Warburg effect promotes migration proliferation human gastric cancer cells. According mechanistic analysis, miR-214 expression induced environmental hypoxia, miR-214 mediates hypoxia-induced functions. explored molecular mechanism miR-214 enhances Warburg effect gastric cancer cells identified adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) PR/SET domain 16 (PRDM16) genes direct targets miR-214. conclusion, miR-214 inhibits A2AR PRDM16 expression enhances Warburg effect gastric cancer cells, thus promoting proliferation migration gastric cancer cells. study highlights important role hypoxia-miR-214-PRDM16/A2AR pathway tumourigenesis gastric cancer may facilitate development new therapeutics hypoxic tumours.
