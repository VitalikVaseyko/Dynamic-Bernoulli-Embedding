 Diapause embryos collected ovigerous females Artemia franciscana Great Salt Lake, Utah, synchronized within 4 h release. Respiration rate freshly released embryos across subsequent 26-d time course showed rapid decrease first several days followed thereafter much slower decline. overall metabolic depression estimated greater 99%. However, proton conductance mitochondria isolated diapause postdiapause embryos identical. proton leak apparently downregulated diapause, mitochondrial membrane potential likely compromised low metabolic rate observed diapause embryos. Given trehalose primary fuel used embryos, measured metabolic intermediates along catabolic pathway trehalose acetyl-CoA diapause postdiapause (active) embryos order identify sites metabolic inhibition. Comparison product-to-substrate ratios sequential enzymatic steps revealed inhibition diapause trehalase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase. Measurements ATP, ADP, AMP allowed calculations substantial decreases ATP:ADP ratio adenylate energy charge diapause. phosphorylation site 1 pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) subunit E1alpha higher diapause embryos postdiapause embryos, consistent PDH inhibition diapause. Taken together, findings indicate restricted substrate availability mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation contributes downregulating metabolic rate diapause.
