 number therapeutic targets currently investigation inhibition hepatic glucose production small molecules. Antagonists glucagon receptor, glycogen phosphorylase, 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase are, been, evaluation human clinical trials. strategies, including glucocorticoid receptor antagonists carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibitors, supported proof principle studies man well rodents. Several potential targets including glucose-6-phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase translocase, glycogen synthase kinase-3, adenosine receptor 2B antagonists, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, validated compounds effective animal models. targets like PGC-1a CREB initial validation support medicinal chemistry reported.
