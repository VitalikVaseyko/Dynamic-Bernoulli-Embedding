 clinical effect fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) administered posthepatectomy patients examined. FBP 0.25 mmol/kg administered continuously hepatic artery 60 minutes 1st postoperative day 11 cases. Hepatic arterial infusion 0.25 mmol/kg glucose performed 7 cases. Furthermore, 10 cases catheter inserted hepatic artery, 0.25 mmol/kg FBP administered intravenously 60-minute period. Arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR) serum levels cyclic adenosine monophosphate, immunoreactive insulin, inorganic phosphorus, glucose, fructose, pyruvate, lactate pyruvate kinase (PK) arterial blood measured administration. AKBR hardly changed hepatic arterial infusion glucose. rose 3 hours intravenous intrahepatic arterial administration FBP. Especially, hepatic arterial infusion FBP, AKBR significantly higher 2 hours administration administration (P < 0.01). hepatic arterial infusion FBP, serum pyruvate transiently increased immediately infusion (P < 0.01). PK activity significantly elevated administration FBP (P < 0.05). Serum lactate levels decreased significantly hepatic arterial infusion FBP (P < 0.05). difference recovery protein synthetic ability postoperative changes serum liver function test values among three groups. Hepatic arterial infusion FBP suggested promote adenosine triphosphate production acceleration glycolytic pathway lactate uptake hepatic cell.
