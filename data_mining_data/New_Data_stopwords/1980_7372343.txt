 Clinical, familial biochemical studies six unrelated Spanish patients hereditary hemolytic anemia erythrocyte pyruvate-kinase (PK) deficiency described. remarkable molecular heterogeneity mutant PK variants involving kinetic properties, molecular stability electrophoretic mobility demonstrated. two patients whose PK variants showed abnormal electrophoretic pattern strongly aberrant kinetic properties, chronic hemolytic anemia associated several clinical manifestations chronic hemolysis occurred. patients whose PK variants showed less abnormal kinetic electrophoretic characteristics, moderate mild hemolytic anemia. One patient's PK variant obvious kinetic electrophoretic alterations, showed markedly decreased heat stability severe diminution antigenic concentration enzyme. patient presented spectacular clinical hematological improvement splenectomy. purpose present study describe six new PK variants Spanish origin. addition, attempt made find relationships molecular abnormalities mutant PK variants severity hemolytic anemia, patients. possible role kinetic alteration, fructose disphosphate (FDP) activation ATP inhibition PK variants, clinical manifestations chronic hemolysis also suggested.
