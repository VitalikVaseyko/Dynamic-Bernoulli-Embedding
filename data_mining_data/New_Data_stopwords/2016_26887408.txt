 Glycolytic shift characteristic feature rapidly proliferating cells, cells development immune response cancer cells, well stem cells. results increased glycolysis uncoupled mitochondrial respiration, also known Warburg effect. Notch signalling active contexts cells undergo glycolytic shift. decided test whether metabolic genes direct transcriptional targets Notch signalling whether upregulation metabolic genes help Notch induce tissue growth physiological conditions conditions Notch-induced hyperplasia. show genes mediating cellular metabolic changes towards Warburg effect direct transcriptional targets Notch signalling. include genes encoding proteins involved glucose uptake, glycolysis, lactate pyruvate conversion repression tricarboxylic acid cycle. direct transcriptional upregulation metabolic genes PI3K/Akt independent occurs cells overactivated Notch also cells endogenous levels Notch signalling vivo. Even short pulse Notch activity able elicit long-lasting metabolic changes resembling Warburg effect. Loss Notch signalling Drosophila wing discs well human microvascular cells leads downregulation glycolytic genes. Notch-driven tissue overgrowth rescued downregulation genes glucose metabolism. Notch activity able support growth wing nutrient-deprivation conditions, independent growth rest body. Notch active situations involve metabolic reprogramming, direct regulation metabolic genes may common mechanism helps Notch exert effects target tissues.
