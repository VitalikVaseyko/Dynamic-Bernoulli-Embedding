 relationship erythroid cell maturation change pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes studied using fluorescent antibody techniques. fluorescence M2-type PK strongest proerythroblast stage, steeply declined red cell maturation weak fluorescence seen orthochromatic erythroblasts. hand, fluorescence L-type PK seen throughout maturation erythroblasts, stronger fluorescence basophilic polychromatic erythroblasts proerythroblasts.
