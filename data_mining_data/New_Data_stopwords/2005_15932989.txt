 aims present investigation develop test sensitive reproducible method study gene expression porcine lung pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR evaluate number suitable internal controls, controls defined yet bacterium. Bacterial gene expression studied vitro exponential early stationary growth medium without sufficient iron, respectively. First, stability expression five genes, glyA, tpiA, pykA, recF, rhoAP genes involved basic housekeeping, evaluated basis mean pairwise variation. housekeeping genes included stably expressed conditions investigated consequently included normalization procedure. Next, geometric mean internal control genes used correct five genes interest. genes three genes involved iron acquisition (tbpA, exbB, fhuD), heat shock protein gene groEL, putative quorum-sensing gene (luxS). level tbpA, exbB, fhuD expression A. pleuropneumoniae showed significant up-regulation iron-restricted conditions compared bacteria grown medium sufficient iron. observed expression patterns genes interest consistent previous observations. study therefore lends support use real-time quantitative RT-PCR, glyA, tpiA, pykA, recF, rhoAP genes internal controls, future similar gene expression studies A. pleuropneumoniae.
