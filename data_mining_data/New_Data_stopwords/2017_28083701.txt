 BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis prenatally detected hyperechogenic enlarged kidneys challenging broad phenotypic overlap several rare genetic non-genetic disorders. Metabolic diseases among rarest underlying disorders, demand particular attention prognosis postnatal management differ diseases. METHODS: report two cases cystic, hyperechogenic enlarged kidneys detected prenatal ultrasound images, resulting suspected diagnosis autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Postnatal clinical course work-up, however, revealed early, neonatal forms disorders fatty acid oxidation (DFAO) cases, namely, glutaric acidemia type II, based identification novel, homozygous splice-site mutation c.1117-2A > G ETFDH gene, one case carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency case. RESULTS: Review pre- postnatal sonographic findings resulted identification important differences might help differentiate DFAO ARPKD. DFAO, kidneys enlarged milder degree ARPKD, cysts located ubiquitously, including also cortex subcapsular area. Interestingly, recent studies pointed switch metabolic homeostasis, referred Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis), one underlying mechanisms cell proliferation cyst formation cystic kidney disease. DFAO characterized inhibition oxidative phosphorylation, resulting aerobic glycolysis, thus resemble Warburg effect. therefore speculate inhibition might one pathomechanisms renal hyperproliferation cyst formation DFAO analogous reported findings ARPKD. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal forms DFAO differentially diagnosed neonates cystic hyperechogenic kidneys necessitate immediate biochemical work-up provide early metabolic management.
