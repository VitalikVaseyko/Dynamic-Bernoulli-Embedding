 Warburg effect refers phenomenon whereby cancer cells avidly take glucose produce lactic acid aerobic conditions. Although molecular mechanisms underlying tumor reliance glycolysis remains completely clear, inhibition opens feasible therapeutic windows cancer treatment. Indeed, several small molecules emerged combinatorial studies exhibiting promising anticancer activity vitro vivo, single agent combination therapeutic modalities. Therefore, besides reviewing alterations glycolysis occur malignant transformation, manuscript aims recapitulating effective pharmacological therapeutics targeting. particular, describe principal mechanisms action main targets 3-bromopyruvate, alkylating agent impressive antitumor effects several models animal tumors. Moreover, discuss chemo-potentiating strategies would make unparalleled putative therapeutic efficacy use clinical settings.
