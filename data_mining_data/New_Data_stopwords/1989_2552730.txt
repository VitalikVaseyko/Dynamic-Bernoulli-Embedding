 Pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5'N) partial deficiency described several hematological disorders also beta-thalassemic trait. check P5'N deficiency thalassemia acquired used thalassemic red cells (from either homo- heterozygous subjects), whose P5'N activity lower control cells. separation density gradient, activity lighter cells similar controls less 50% denser cells. probable mechanism faster inactivation involves enzyme -SH groups modification oxidation reaction monofunctional aldehydes produced membrane lipid peroxidation. vitro challenge thiol enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK), adenylate kinase (AK) P5'N increasing concentrations GSSG, hexanal (HEX) 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), showed HNE powerful among enzyme inhibitors tested P5'N activity sensitive index -SH groups damage, compared PK AK.
