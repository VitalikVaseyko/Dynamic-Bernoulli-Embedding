 1. Developmental enzyme alterations investigated skeletal muscle hereditary progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD) mice C57BL/6J strain. 2. Enzymes examined classified three groups according changes activities dystrophy muscle ageing. Activities creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1), fructose-biphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), respective muscle specific isoenzyme extremely high activity normal adult skeletal muscle, decreased rapidly dystrophy muscle early stage disease ageing. Activities glycogen synthase (EC 2.4.1.11) hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) higher dystrophy muscle early stage decreased gradually lower levels control ageing. Activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) always much higher dystrophy muscle control, relation ageing. 3. Isoenzymes creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase phosphorylase dystrophy muscle mainly muscle types, indicating muscle differentiation blocked profoundly even dystrophy muscle. limited cases, especially early stage disease, weak activities non-muscle fetal type isoenzymes creatine kinase phosphorylase detected, apparently associated partial muscle regeneration dystrophy muscle.
