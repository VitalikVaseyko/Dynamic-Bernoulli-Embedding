 Properties mung bean pyruvate kinase studied active site groups derived. Metabolites like AMP, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate, 3-phospho-glycerate, isocitrate, malate alpha-ketoglutarate practically effect pyruvate kinase activity. Alanine, serine, glutamine, methionine GMP weak activating effect enzyme. metabolites ATP, GTP, UMP found weakly inhibitory. Moderate strong inhibition observed citrate, succinate, glutamate oxalate. Inhibition brought ATP citrate present together showed synergistic effect. Inhibition citrate non-competitive respect PEP ADP suggesting presence regulatory site. Mung bean pyruvate kinase showed half optimal activity pH 6.6 8.9 saturating concentrations PEP, ADP Mg2+. Small concentrations SH specific reagents, namely iodoacetamide (0.1 0.2 mM), N-ethylmaleimide(0.05-0.1 mM) p-chloromercuribenzoate (0.1 mM) inactivated enzyme; single exponential loss activity observed case. Photooxidation enzyme presence methylene blue (100 200 micrograms/ml) rose bengal (5 10 micrograms/ml) also led single exponential activity decay. enzyme treated diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP), time dependent exponential decay activity observed parallel increase absorbance 240 nm. PEP protected enzyme inactivation DEP. Reagents specific tyrosine (iodine tetranitromethane) tryptophan residues (N-bromosuccinimide) residues effect. observations confirm SH imidazole groups vital activity enzyme.
