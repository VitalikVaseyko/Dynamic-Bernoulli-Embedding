 Using bovine kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase complex investigated mechanism whereby three pyruvate dehydrogenase (active form) kinase molecules, tightly bound dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core, rapidly phosphorylate inactivate 20 pyruvate dehydrogenase (active form) (PDHa) tetramers also bound 60-subunit core. Evidence presented PDHa kinase activity serviced process dissociation reassociation PDHa. Rapid inactivation full complement PDHa occurs rate exceeding rate dissociation PDHa, indicating PDHa must move fixed kinase subunits without dissociating dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core. Consistent concept, low concentrations complex significant portion PDHa free, bound PDHa inactivated rate equivalent higher concentrations complex, free PDHa phosphorylated slowly rate closely approximated rate association free PDHa transacetylase core. Thus, low number PDHa molecules bound, PDHa either preferentially positioned phosphorylation inactivation PDHa kinase rapidly become positioned without dissociating transacetylase core.
