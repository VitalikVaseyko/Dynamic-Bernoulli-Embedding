 Two polymorphisms, one liver-type pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR) one glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), band q21 chromosome 1, found tightly linked. three Gaucher disease mutations 112 chromosomes studied associated unique haplotype. conservative assumption length time Gaucher disease mutation present Jewish population, deduce genetic distance two loci probably 0.2 centimorgans. Four haplotypes produced polymorphic loci, two relatively uncommon polymorphic sites linkage disequilibrium. Nonetheless markers potentially useful prenatal diagnosis pyruvate kinase deficiency families least one affected child may also helpful heterozygote detection families Gaucher disease specific mutation producing disease unknown.
