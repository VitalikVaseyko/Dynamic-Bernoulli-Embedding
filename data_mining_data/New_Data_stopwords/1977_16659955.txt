 activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pea (Pisum sativum L.) mitochondria inhibited MgATP added reaction mixture; 50% inhibition occurs 4 mm ATP. inhibition increase time higher highly purified preparations. Crude preparations complex show time-dependent inactivation incubated 7.5 mm MgATP alone found highly purified complex. inactivation occur 0 C. complex could reactivated high concentrations Mg(2+). suggested phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism may occur plants, phosphatase kinase tightly bound complex lost isolation. complex respond significant manner energy charge. NAD(+) NADH ratio principal means regulation complex, NADH competitive NAD(+) dihydrolipoamide component. CoA acetyl-CoA ratio important regulation.The castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) proplastid complex inhibited addition 2 mm MgATP assay mixture. inhibition immediate, suggesting phosphorylation enzyme involved must rapid. Incubation complex 20 mm MgCl(2) causes activation complex. Maximum activity expressed case 30 minutes. similar activation achieved preincubating complex 1 mm pyruvate. data suggest complex fully activated isolation.
