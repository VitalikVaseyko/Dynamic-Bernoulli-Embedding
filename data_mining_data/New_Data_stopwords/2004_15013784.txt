 report kinetic characterization previously unidentified pyruvate kinase (PK) activity extracts Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. activity 74% activity pyruvate phosphate dikinase. EhPK differed PKs pH optimum 5.5-6.5 inhibited high PEP concentrations (1-5mM); concentrations PK usually assayed. optimal temperature 40 degrees C negligible activity 20 degrees C. EhPK exhibited hyperbolic kinetics respect PEP (K(m) = 0.018 mM) ADP (K(m) = 1.05 mM). However, exhibited sigmoidal behavior respect PEP sub-saturating ADP concentrations. EhPK require monovalent cations activity. Fructose-1,6 bisphosphate potent non-essential activator; increased affinity ADP without modification V(max) affinity PEP. Phosphate, citrate, malate, alpha-ketoglutarate significantly inhibited EhPK activity. putative EhPK gene fragment found EhDNA analyzed. data indicate E. histolytica trophozoites contain active PK, might contribute generation glycolytic ATP parasite survival.
