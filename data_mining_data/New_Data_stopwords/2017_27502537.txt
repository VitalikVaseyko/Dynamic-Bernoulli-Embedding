 studied effects insulin cAMP offspring female rats daily treatment substances 4 weeks. adult offspring cAMP-treated females, activities pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase decreased liver brain activities NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase decreased liver. offspring insulin-treated females, observed activation glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase liver females. Enzyme activity probably correlates content, changes kinetic properties observed conditions. Long-term hormone treatment pregnancy affect expression genes enzymes offspring due transmission epigenetic signals ovum. However, studies required confirm mechanism.
