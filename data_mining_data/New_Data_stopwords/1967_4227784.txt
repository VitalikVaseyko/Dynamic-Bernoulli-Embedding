 1. Intracellular concentrations intermediates cofactors glycolysis measured guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices incubated varying conditions. 2. Comparison mass-action ratios apparent equilibrium constants reactions glycolysis showed hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase catalyse reactions generally far equilibrium, whereas phosphoglucose isomerase, aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, adenlyate kinase creatine phosphokinase generally close equilibrium. possibility glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase may catalyse ;non-equilibrium' reaction discussed. 3. Correlation changes concentrations substrates enzymes catalysing ;non-equilibrium' reactions changes rates glycolysis caused alteration conditions incubation showed hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase possibly glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase subject metabolic control cerebral cortex slices. 4. suggested glycolysis controlled two regulatory systems, hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-pyruvate kinase system. discussed. 5. concluded rate glycolysis guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices limited either rate glucose entry slices hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system. 6. concluded addition 0.1mm-ouabain guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices causes inhibition either glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphoglycerate kinase both, manner independent known action ouabain sodium- potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase.
