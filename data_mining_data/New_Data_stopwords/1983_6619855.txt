 Neuron-specific enolase creatine phosphokinase found, 2-dimensional gel analysis, rat brain synaptic plasma membranes (SPM). identity enzymes confirmed comigration purified rat brain NSE CPK peptide analysis. specific enzymatic activities enolase creatine phosphokinase, well pyruvate kinase, also present membranes, comparable homogenates three enzymes fully activated. SPM three enzymes, particularly enolase, partially cryptic enzymatic activities low unless membranes treated Triton X-100. resistant low-salt high-salt extraction trypsin, except Triton X-100 present. results suggest enzymes tightly bound protein components membrane may constitute assembly capable generating ATP.
