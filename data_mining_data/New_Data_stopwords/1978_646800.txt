 1. Sodium dichloroacetate (1mM) inhibited glucose production L-lactate kidney-cortex slices fed, starved alloxan-diabetic rates. general gluconeogenesis substrates inhibited. 2. Sodium dichloracetate inhibited glucose production L-lactate pyruvate perfused isolated kidneys normal alloxan-diabetic rats. 3. Sodium dichloroacetate inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase reaction effected conversion pyruvate dehydrogenase active (dephosphorylated) form kidney vivo. general, pyruvate dehydrogenase mainly active form kidneys perfused incubated L-lactate inhibitory effect dichloroacetate glucose production dependent activation pyruvate dehydrogenase. 4. Balance data kidney slices showed dichloroacetate inhibits lactate uptake, glucose pyruvate production lactate, oxidation lactate. 5. mechanism effect dichloroactetate glucose production lactate fully defined, evidence suggests may involve fall tissue pyruvate concentration inhibition pyruvate carboxylation.
