 Tumor cell proliferation requires rapid synthesis macromolecules including lipids, proteins, nucleotides. Many tumor cells exhibit rapid glucose consumption, glucose-derived carbon secreted lactate despite abundant oxygen availability (the Warburg effect). Here, used 13C NMR spectroscopy examine metabolism glioblastoma cells exhibiting aerobic glycolysis. cells, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle active characterized efflux substrates use biosynthetic pathways, particularly fatty acid synthesis. success synthetic activity depends activation pathways generate reductive power (NADPH) restore oxaloacetate continued TCA cycle function (anaplerosis). Surprisingly, needs met high rate glutamine metabolism. First, conversion glutamine lactate (glutaminolysis) rapid enough produce sufficient NADPH support fatty acid synthesis. Second, despite substantial mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism, pyruvate carboxylation suppressed, anaplerotic oxaloacetate derived glutamine. Glutamine catabolism accompanied secretion alanine ammonia, amino groups glutamine lost cell rather incorporated molecules. data demonstrate transformed cells exhibit high rate glutamine consumption cannot explained nitrogen demand imposed nucleotide synthesis maintenance nonessential amino acid pools. Rather, glutamine metabolism provides carbon source facilitates cell's ability use glucose-derived carbon TCA cycle intermediates biosynthetic precursors.
