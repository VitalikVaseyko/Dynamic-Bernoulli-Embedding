 complete absence K+ phosphate (Pi), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDHK2) catalytically active elevated Km ATP, activity insensitive effector regulation. find K+ 5-fold lower levels NH4+ markedly enhanced quenching Trp383 fluorescence PDHK2 ADP ATP. K+ binding caused approximately 40-fold decrease equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) ATP approximately 120 3.0 microM approximately 25-fold decrease Kd ADP approximately 950 38 microM. Linked reductions Kd PDHK2 K+ approximately 30 approximately 0.75 mM ATP bound approximately 40 approximately 1.7 mM ADP bound. Without K+, little effect ADP pyruvate binding, 100 mM K+ 100 microM ADP, L0.5 PDHK2 pyruvate reduced approximately 14 fold. absence K+, Pi small effects ligand binding. 100 mM K+, 20 mM Pi modestly enhanced binding ADP hindered pyruvate binding markedly enhanced binding pyruvate ADP; L0.5 pyruvate specifically decreased approximately 125-fold 100 microM ADP. Pi effects minimal NH4+ replaced K+. quantified coupled binding K+ ATP ADP elucidated linked K+ Pi binding required potent inhibition PDHK2 ADP pyruvate.
