 Aging involves progressive loss cellular function integrity, presumably caused accumulated stochastic damage cells. Alterations energy metabolism contribute aging, energy metabolism changes age, changes affect aging, whether modified modulate aging remain unclear. locomotory muscle post-fertile Caenorhabditis elegans, identified progressive decrease cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C), longevity-associated metabolic enzyme, reciprocal increase glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PK) necessary sufficient limit lifespan. Decline PEPCK-C age also led loss cellular function integrity including muscle activity, cellular senescence. Genetic pharmacologic interventions PEPCK-C, muscle activity, AMPK signaling demonstrate declines PEPCK-C muscle function age interacted limit reproductive life lifespan via disrupted energy homeostasis. Quantifications metabolic flux show reciprocal changes PEPCK-C PK age shunted energy metabolism toward glycolysis, reducing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Last, calorie restriction countered changes PEPCK-C PK age elicit anti-aging effects via TOR inhibition. Thus, programmed metabolic event involving PEPCK-C PK determinant aging modified modulate aging.
