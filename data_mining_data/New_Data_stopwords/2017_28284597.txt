 Integration mitochondria cytosolic ATP-consuming/ATP-sensing substrate supply processes critical gills bioenergetics, since tissue plays important role respiratory energy metabolism. effects bacterial infection gills remain poorly understood, limited histopathological analyses. Thus, aim study investigate whether experimental infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA01 alters enzymes phosphoryltransfer network (adenylate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK) cytosolic mitochondrial creatine kinase (CK)) gills silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). animals divided two groups six fish each: uninfected (negative control) infected (positive control). day 7 post-infection (PI), animals euthanized gills collected. AK, PK, cytosolic mitochondrial CK activities gills decreased infected compared uninfected animals. Also, severe gill damage destruction primary secondary lamellae observed infected animals. Therefore, demonstrated, first time, experimental infection P. aeruginosa inhibits key enzymes linked production utilization metabolic energy silver catfish, consequently, impairs cellular energy homeostasis, may contribute disease pathogenesis.
