 Monocytes enter sites microbial sterile inflammation first line defense immune system initiate pro-inflammatory effector mechanisms. show activation bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces undergo metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis, similar Warburg effect observed cancer cells. sites inflammation, however, glucose concentrations often drastically decreased, prompted us study monocyte function conditions glucose deprivation abrogated Warburg effect. Experiments using Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer revealed limited glucose supply shifts monocyte metabolism toward oxidative phosphorylation, fueled largely fatty acid oxidation expense lipid droplets. metabolic state appears provide sufficient energy sustain functional properties like cytokine secretion, migration, phagocytosis, cannot prevent rise AMP/ATP ratio decreased respiratory burst. molecular trigger mediating metabolic shift functional consequences activation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Taken together, results indicate monocytes sufficiently metabolically flexible perform pro-inflammatory functions sites inflammation despite glucose deprivation inhibition LPS-induced Warburg effect. AMPK seems play pivotal role orchestrating processes glucose deprivation monocytes.
