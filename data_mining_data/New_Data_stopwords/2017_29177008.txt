 Background: Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 fastest growing cyanobacterium characterized date. genome found 99.8% identical S. elongatus 7942 yet grows twice fast. Current genome-to-phenome mapping still poorly performed non-model organisms. Even species identical genomes, cell phenotypes strikingly different. understand Synechococcus 2973's fast-growth phenotype metabolic features advantageous photo-biorefineries, (13)C isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA), biomass compositional analysis, gene knockouts, metabolite profiling performed strains various growth conditions. Results: Synechococcus 2973 flux maps show substantial carbon flow Calvin cycle, glycolysis, photorespiration pyruvate kinase, minimal flux malic enzyme oxidative pentose phosphate pathways high light/CO2 conditions. fast growth, pool sizes key metabolites central pathways lower suboptimal growth. Synechococcus 2973 demonstrated similar flux ratios Synechococcus 7942 (under fast growth conditions), exhibited greater carbon assimilation, higher NADPH concentrations, higher energy charge (relative ATP ratio ADP AMP), less accumulation glycogen, potentially metabolite channeling. Furthermore, Synechococcus 2973 limited flux TCA pathway small pool sizes acetyl-CoA/TCA intermediates growth conditions. Conclusions: study employed flux analysis investigate phenotypic heterogeneity among two cyanobacterial strains near-identical genome background. flux/metabolite profiling, biomass composition analysis, genetic modification results elucidate highly effective metabolic topology CO2 assimilatory biosynthesis Synechococcus 2973. Comparisons across multiple Synechococcus strains indicate faster metabolism also driven proportional increases photosynthesis key central pathway fluxes. Moreover, flux distribution Synechococcus 2973 supports use strong sugar phosphate pathways optimal bio-productions. integrated methodologies study applied characterizing non-model microbial metabolism.
