 OBJECTIVE: Fusarium mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) zearalenone (ZEN), common contaminants feed farm animals, cause immune function impairment organ inflammation. Consequently, main objective study elucidate ZEN effects mRNA expression pro-inflammatory cytokines immune related genes kidneys piglets. METHODS: Fifteen 6-week-old piglets randomly assigned three dietary treatments 4 weeks: control diet, diets contaminated either 8 mg DON/kg feed 0.8 mg ZEN/kg feed. Kidney samples collected treatment, RNA-seq used investigate effects immune-related genes gene networks. RESULTS: total 186 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) screened (120 upregulated 66 downregulated). Gene ontology analysis revealed immune response, cellular metabolic processes significantly controlled DEGs. inflammatory stimulation might effect following enriched Kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes pathway analysis found related immune disease responses: cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, chemical carcinogenesis. effects ZEN genome-wide expression assessed, found DEGs associated inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 receptor, beta, chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 9, CXCL10, chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 4), proliferation (insulin like growth factor binding protein 4, IgG heavy chain, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C, cytochrome P450 1A1, ATP-binding cassette sub-family 8), immune response networks (lysozyme, complement component 4 binding protein alpha, oligoadenylate synthetase 2, signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-9, alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, Ig lambda chain c region, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4, carboxylesterase 1), suppressed ZEN. CONCLUSION: summary, results indicate high concentrations ZEN suppress inflammatory response kidneys, leading potential effects immune homeostasis.
