 Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) synthesized purine salvage synthesis pathway Arthrobacter A302. Results showed hypoxanthine best precursors, cAMP concentration reached 4.06 g/L. inhibition glycolytic pathway, sodium fluoride found optimal effector, studied cAMP production. addition 0.4 g/L sodium fluoride, maximal cAMP concentration reached 11.04 g/L, concentrations lactic acid, alpha-ketoglutarate citric acid decreased 77%, 86% 76%, respectively. Meanwhile, specific activities glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase decreased 66%, 61%, 46%, respectively. contrast activity 6-phosphoglucose dehydrogenase increased 100%, demonstrated redistribution metabolic flux. first study reveal regulatory mechanisms different effectors cAMP production among EMP pathway, HMP pathway TCA cycle.
