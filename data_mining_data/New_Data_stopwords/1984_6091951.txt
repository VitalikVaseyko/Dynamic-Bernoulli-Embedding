Conclusive evidence metabolic block found. evaluated effects pyrimidine (cytidine uridine) tri- diphosphate nucleotides (CTP, CDP, UTP, UDP) choline ethanolamine derivatives CDP (CDP-choline, CDP-ethanolamine) activities key enzymes Embden-Meyerhof pathway. CTP UTP inhibited fructose-6-phosphate competitively phosphofructokinase phosphoenolpyruvate competitively pyruvate kinase. cases, Ki pyrimidine nucleotide Km glycolytic substrate intraerythrocytic concentrations.

Thus, nature hemolytic anemia hereditary P5'N deficiency remains enigmatic.
