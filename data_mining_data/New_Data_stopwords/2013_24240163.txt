 2-Oxoglutarate (2OG) important currency stands crossroad carbon nitrogen metabolism. Recent research found 2OG acts signal regulation nitrogen metabolism prokaryote. eukaryotic cells, 2OG also attractive since tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) tumor cells found undergo metabolic alterations Warburg effect. method tracing key metabolite 2OG cellular level highly desirable. order visualize monitor 2-oxoglutarate metabolism single living cells, developed novel sensor inserting functional 2OG-binding domain GAF NifA protein YFP. sensor found highly speci fi c 2OG. Following binding 2OG, fluorescence intensity sensor increased increasing 2OG concentration reached 1.5-fold maximum fluorescence signal change (F/F0-1), kinetics fluorescence signal upon 2OG association sensor fast, dynamic response range mOGsor sensors 100 microM-100 mM. Dissociation sensor 2OG verified vitro vivo. sensor reported cellular 2OG dynamics E. coli cells real time upon different nutrition challenges manifested differences 2OG pool accumulation consumption rate.
