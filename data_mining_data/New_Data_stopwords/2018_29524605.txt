 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) byproducts oxygen metabolism best known damaging potential, recent evidence exposed role secondary messengers, regulate cell function redox-activatable signaling systems. immune cells, specifically cells, redox-sensitive signaling pathways implicated controlling several functional domains; including cell cycle progression, effector cell differentiation, tissue invasion inflammatory behavior. cells patients autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA) emerged valuable model system examine functional impact ROS cell function. Notably, RA cells distinguished healthy cells based reduced ROS production undergo "reductive stress". Upstream defects leading ROS(low) status RA cells connected metabolic reorganization. RA cells shunt glucose away pyruvate ATP production towards pentose phosphate pathway, generate NADPH consume cellular ROS. Downstream consequences ROS(low) conditions RA cells include insufficient activation DNA repair kinase ATM, bypassing G2/M cell cycle checkpoint biased differentiation cells IFN-gamma IL-17-producing inflammatory cells. Also, ROS(low) cells rapidly invade peripheral tissue due dysregulated lipogenesis, excessive membrane ruffling, overexpression motility module dominated scaffolding protein Tks5. data place ROS pinnacle position connecting cellular metabolism protective versus auto-aggressive cell immunity. Therapeutic interventions targeted ROS enhancement instead ROS depletion developed novel strategy treat autoimmune tissue inflammation.
