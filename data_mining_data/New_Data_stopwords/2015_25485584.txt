 Aberrant activation SHH pathway major cause medulloblastoma (MB), frequent brain malignancy childhood. Hedgehog inhibitors, antagonizing membrane transducer Smo, approved clinical trials treatment human MB. However, efficacy drugs limited occurrence novel mutations activation downstream non-canonical Hedgehog components. Thus, identification novel druggable downstream pathways represents critical step overcome problem. present work demonstrate aerobic glycolysis valuable HH-dependent downstream target, since inhibition significantly counteracts HH-mediated growth normal tumor cells. Hedgehog activation induces transcription hexokinase 2 (HK2) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), two key gatekeepers glycolysis. process mediated canonical activation Gli transcription factors causes robust increase extracellular lactate concentration. show inhibition glycolysis different levels blocks Hedgehog-induced proliferation granule cell progenitors (GCPs), cells medulloblastoma arises. Remarkably, demonstrate glycolytic transcriptional program also upregulated SHH-dependent tumors pharmacological targeting pyruvate kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) efficiently represses MB growth vitro vivo. Together, data illustrate previously uncharacterized pharmacological strategy target Hedgehog dependent growth, exploited treatment medulloblastoma patients.
