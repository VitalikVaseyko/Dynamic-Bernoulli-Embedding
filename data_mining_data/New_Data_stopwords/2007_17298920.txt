 BACKGROUND: Global travellers increasingly risk contracting malaria. increasing occurrence drug-resistance many endemic areas emphasizes need novel drug targets antimalarial-screening. study, use pyruvate kinase drug-target evaluated. functional validation gene encoding pyruvate kinase (designated PK1) previously reported. However, alternative copies enzyme encoded Plasmodium falciparum could also circumvent role PK1. survey genome data revealed putative ORF seemingly coding another pyruvate kinase (designated PK2). METHODS: expression PK1 PK2 vitro cultures investigated RT-PCR. Biocomputational analysis carried identify structural differences P. falciparum pyruvate kinases corresponding enzymes human host. RESULTS: PK1 PK2 indeed actively transcribed intraerythrocytic stages, suggesting involvement enzymes infection. comparison amino acid residues effector binding sites PK1 PK2, human pyruvate kinases revealed significant differences could serve targets selective inhibitors designed parasitic pyruvate kinases. CONCLUSION: Experimental evidence expression PK1 PK2 blood stages malaria infection provided. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed "PK2" type enzyme appears confined Apicomplexans, important observation respect assessment PK2 drug-target.
