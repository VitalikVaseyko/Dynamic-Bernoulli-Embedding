 Increased glycolysis overexpression glucose transporters (GLUTs) physiological characteristics human malignancies. Based so-called Warburg effect, 18flurodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) successfully developed clinical modality diagnosis staging many cancers. leverage glucose transporter mediated metabolic disparity normal malignant cells, current report, focus fluorine substituted series glucose, mannose galactose-conjugated (trans-R,R-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine)-2-flouromalonato-platinum(II) complexes comprehensive evaluation selective tumor targeting. Besides highly improved water solubility, sugar-conjugates presented improved cytotoxicity oxaliplatin glucose tranporters (GLUTs) overexpressing cancer cell lines exhibited cross-resistance cisplatin. highly water soluble glucose-conjugated complex (5a), two novel vivo assessments conducted results revealed 5a efficacious lower equitoxic dose (70% MTD) oxaliplatin (100% MTD) HT29 xenograft model, significantly potent oxaliplatin leukemia-bearing DBA/2 mice well even equimolar dose levels (18% vs 90% MTD). GLUT inhibitor mediated cell viability analysis, GLUT1 knockdown cell line-based cytotoxicity evaluation, platinum accumulation study demonstrated cellular uptake sugar-conjugates regulated GLUT1. higher intrinsic DNA reactivity sugar-conjugates confirmed kinetic study platinum(II)-guanosine adduct formation. mechanistic origin antitumor effect fluorine complexes found forming bifunctional Pt-guanine-guanine (Pt-GG) intrastrand cross-links DNA. results provide rationale Warburg effect targeted anticancer drug design.
