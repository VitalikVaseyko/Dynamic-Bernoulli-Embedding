 past decade researches revealed mutations known putative glycosyltransferases several types muscular dystrophy, including Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy. disorders, function alpha-dystroglycan severely decreased, therefore called alpha-dystroglycanopathy. Recently, putative glycosyltransferase Large shown restore defective function alpha-dystroglycan, thus, intriguing idea apply effect therapy alpha-dystroglycanopathy. present study, sought test possibility. Using several cultured cell lines, confirmed overexpression Large results hyperglycosylation marked enhancement function alpha-dystroglycan. effect, whole luminal domain Large shown necessary using several deletion constructs. generated transgenic mice overexpressing Large ubiquitously. tissue mice, glycosylation alpha-dystroglycan laminin binding activity remarkably increased. Moreover, morphological analyses tissue stained H-E revealed significant abnormality transgenic mice, suggesting serious side effects overexpression Large. Taken together, results indicate restoration function alpha-dystroglycan Large important molecular target develop therapeutic strategies alpha-dystroglycanopathy.
