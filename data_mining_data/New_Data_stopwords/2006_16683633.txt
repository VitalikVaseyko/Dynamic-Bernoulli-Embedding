 Important biological activities could affected metal exposed species, amongthe main physiological functions, immunity may provide one (or more) effector(s) expression directly affected metal exposure various macroinvertebrates. many proteinic effectors showed high degree homology species, developed PCR approach characterize partial mRNA sequences selected effectors laboratory model, Eisenia fetida. cloning, levels expression gene analyzed following exposures (80 800 mg/kg) cadmium spiked soils using real-time PCR. implemented approach allowed test quickly potential biomarkers Eisenia fetida. Selected effectors calmodulin, heat shock proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, metallothionein, beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, pyruvate carboxylase, trancriptionally controlled tumor protein, protein kinase C, ubiquitin. selected effectors show variations expression level exposure. Others expressed weak changes expression heat shock proteins. lastfor catalase metallothionein, early suitable variations expression observed.
