 effects seasonal change, November versus July, prolonged anoxia (96 h N2 gas) properties phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase five tissues (gill, mantle, hepatopancreas, phasic adductor, catch adductor) oyster, Crassostrea virginica investigated. enzymes showed tissue-specific season-specific changes kinetic properties; pyruvate kinase correlated seasonal differences enzyme elution patterns hydroxylapatite chromatography. Kinetic properties enzymes winter consistent primarily catabolic roles glycolysis responsiveness cellular energy demands, whereas summer enzymes may closely regulated respect biosynthetic gluconeogenic functions tissues. Anoxia-induced changes phosphofructokinase properties relatively minor anoxia stimulated changes pyruvate kinase properties elution profiles hydroxylapatite tissues except mantle, much greater effects seen enzyme winter versus summer animals. example, anoxia-induced changes pyruvate kinase winter gill included fourfold rise substrate affinity constant phosphoenolpyruvate, sevenfold increase concentration fructose-1,6-bisphosphate needed activate enzyme 50%, 50% decrease concentration L-alanine inhibits activity 50%. Changes pyruvate kinase kinetics hydroxylapatite elution patterns prolonged anoxia consistent covalent modification pyruvate kinase contrary results many mollusc species, anoxia exposure appears induce dephosphorylation enzyme.
