 1. Two women severe hypokalaemic alkalosis investigated means muscle biopsy end 2 3 weeks respectively intense therapy potassium chloride. 2. muscle biopsy material analysed water, electrolytes, adenine nucleotides, phosphocreatine, free creatine, pyruvate, lactate, glycogen free amino acids. extra- intra-cellular distribution water, electrolytes amino acids calculated chloride method. 3. patients showed marked loss intracellular potassium increase intracellular sodium concentration. muscle magnesium content also slightly decreased. repletion potassium chloride, muscle sodium potassium became normal. 4. contents creatine phosphate, ATP, ADP, AMP, lactate pyruvate within normal limits, phosphocreatine/total creatine ratio reduced. repletion, small change apparent creatine-phosphokinase equilibrium occurred, suggesting minor increase intracellular pH. 5. concentrations basic amino acids, lysine, arginine ornithine increased far normal. intracellular accumulation arginine much higher increase lysine concentration histidine concentration normal. differs findings potassium-depleted rats, intracellular lysine concentration much higher arginine concentration histidine high well. potassium repletion intracellular concentration ornithine, lysine arginine became normal one case decreased considerable other. increased intracellular concentration glutamate glutamine also observed potassium repletion.
