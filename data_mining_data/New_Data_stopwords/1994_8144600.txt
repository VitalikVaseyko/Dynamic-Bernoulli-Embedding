 L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) key enzyme glycolytic pathway mainly expressed liver. Rat liver contains regulatory protein inhibits glucokinase (GK) activity. effect protein greatly reinforced fructose 6-phosphate antagonized fructose 1-phosphate (Van Schaftingen, E. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 179, 179-184). hepatocytes, fructose low concentrations phosphorylated fructose 1-phosphate, therefore able active GK absence insulin via regulatory protein liver. primary culture rat hepatocytes, 0.2 mM fructose presence 20 40 mM glucose stimulated activity L-PK gene promoter fused chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, regardless addition insulin, glucose/insulin response element. constitutive GK expression vector co-transfected L-PK/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct also able confer insulin-independent glucose responsiveness hepatocytes. Thus, insulin effect glucose-dependent activation L-PK promoter is, experimental conditions, permit glucose phosphorylation stimulation GK synthesis. presence glucose, L-PK promoter also activated post-translational GK activation, mediated low concentration fructose acting via regulatory protein glucokinase.
