 Metabolic adaptations emerging common traits cancer cells tumor progression. vitro transformation NIH 3T3 cells allows analysis metabolic changes triggered single oncogene. work, compared metabolic changes induced H-RAS nuclear resident mutant histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). RAS-transformed cells exhibit dominant aerobic glycolytic phenotype characterized up-regulation glycolytic enzymes, reduced oxygen consumption defect complex activity. model transformation, glycolysis strictly required sustaining ATP levels robust cellular proliferation. contrast, HDAC4/TM transformed cells, glycolysis modestly up-regulated, lactate secretion augmented and, instead, mitochondrial oxygen consumption increased. results demonstrate cellular transformation accomplished different metabolic adaptations HDAC4/TM cells represent useful model investigate oncogene-driven metabolic changes besides Warburg effect.
