 Glioblastoma (GBM) common lethal primary malignant brain tumor humans. phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway activated 88% GBM, new drugs target pathway, mTOR inhibitor Everolimus, currently clinical trials. Early tumor response molecularly targeted treatments remains challenging assess non-invasively, often associated tumor stasis slower tumor growth. Innovative neuroimaging methods therefore critically needed provide metabolic functional information indicative targeted therapeutic action early time points course treatment. study, demonstrated first time hyperpolarized (HP) 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) used clinical MR system monitor early metabolic response orthotopic GBM tumors Everolimus treatment measurement HP lactate-to-pyruvate ratios. study performed highly invasive non-enhancing orthotopic GBM tumor model rats (GS-2 tumors), replicates many fundamental features human GBM tumors. Seven days initiation treatment significant drop HP lactate-to-pyruvate ratio tumor tissue treated animals relative day 0 (67%+/-27% decrease). control group, significant changes HP lactate-to-pyruvate ratios observed. Importantly, 7 day time point, conventional MR imaging (MRI) unable detect significant difference tumor size control treated groups. Inhibition tumor growth conventional MRI observed day 15 treatment. implies decrease HP lactate-to-pyruvate ratio could detected treatment-induced inhibition tumor growth. Using immunohistochemical staining examine tumor response treatment, found decrease HP lactate-to-pyruvate ratio associated drop expression lactate dehydrogenase, enzyme catalyzes pyruvate lactate conversion. Also evident decreased staining carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), indicator hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) activity, which, turn, regulates expression lactate dehydrogenase. knowledge, study first report use HP 13C MRSI clinical field strength monitor GBM response molecularly targeted treatments. highlights potential HP lactate-to-pyruvate ratio early biomarker response, thereby supporting investigation non-invasive imaging approach eventual clinical application.
