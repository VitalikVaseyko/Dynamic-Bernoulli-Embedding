 human leukaemia, resistance chemotherapy leads treatment ineffectiveness failure. Previous studies indicated cancers increased levels aerobic glycolysis insensitive numerous forms chemotherapy respond poorly radiotherapy. Whether glycolysis serves key role drug resistance leukaemia cells remains unclear. present study systematically investigated aerobic glycolytic alterations regulation K562/adriamycin (ADM) multidrugresistant (MDR) ADMsensitive K562 leukaemia cells normoxia, association drug resistance improper glycometabolism. cell proliferating activity assessed MTT colorimetric assay, glycolysis, including glucose consumption, lactate export keyenzyme activity determined corresponding commercial testing kits. expression levels hexokinaseII (HKII), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), glucose transporter4 (GLUT4), AKT, pAKT473/308, mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), pmTOR, cMyc hypoxiainducible factor1alpha (HIF1alpha) analyzed western blot reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). K562/ADM cells exhibited increased glucose consumption lactate accumulation, increased lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities, reduced phosphofructokinase activity. addition, K562/ADM cells expressed significantly HKII GLUT4. Notably, inhibition glycolysis effectively killed sensitive resistant leukaemia cells potently restored sensitivity MDR cells anticancer agent ADM. AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT)/mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, crucial regulator glycometabolic homeostasis, mediated overactivation upregulation cMyc expression levels K562/ADM cells, directly stimulated glucose consumption enhanced glycolysis. conclusion, present study demonstrated MDR leukaemia cells exhibit increased aerobic glycolytic activity may responsible resistance chemotherapeutics leukaemia MDR cells via activation AKTmTORcMyc signalling pathway. Therefore, inhibition aerobic glycolysis may potential therapeutic strategy efficiently treat multidrug resistance relapsed refractory leukaemia cancers.
