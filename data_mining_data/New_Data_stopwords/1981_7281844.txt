 Porcine livers preserved 6 hours simple hypothermic storage using plasma-protein-fraction, albumin, Collins C2, Ringer solution, Ring-trickle-perfusion. Following glycolytic metabolites examined: G6P, F6P, FDP, GAP, 2PG, PEP, pyruvate, lactate. alteration glycolytic metabolite-profile different preservation methods seen. limitation glycolysis pyruvate-kinase-reaction. Glycolysis decreases depending preservation time. artificial increasing glycogen rate glycolysis hepatectomy seems without effect.
