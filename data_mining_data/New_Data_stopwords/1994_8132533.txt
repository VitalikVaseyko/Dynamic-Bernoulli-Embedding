 Three new reactive nucleotide analogues bromo-keto substituents adjacent thiophosphate synthesized. Guanosine 5'-O-[S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)]thiophosphate (GMPS-BDB), reacts covalently rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase complete inactivation incorporation 1.8 mol reagent/mol enzyme subunit. contrast, mono-keto compound, guanosine 5'-O-[S-(3-bromo-2-oxopropyl)]thiophosphate (GMPS-BOP), causes loss pyruvate kinase activity. analogous adenosyl nucleotide derivatives incubated pyruvate kinase, di-keto compound, adenosine 5'-O-[S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)]thiophosphate (AMPS-BDB), rapidly effects inactivation, whereas mono-keto compound, adenosine 5'-O-[S-(3-bromo-2-oxopropyl)]thiophosphate (AMPS-BOP), causes loss activity. Complete protection inactivation GMPS-BDB provided phosphoenolpyruvate presence K+ Mn2+ amount reagent incorporated (0.9 mol/reagent/mol subunit) reduced half observed absence protectants. Gas-phase sequencing tryptic peptides purified inactive GMPS-BDB AMPS-BDB-modified enzyme gave cysteine-labeled peptides: C151DENILWLDYK161, N162IC164K165 two major peptide products, smaller amount N43TGIIC48TIGPASR55. Reaction presence protectants PEP, K+, Mn2+ yielded Cys164 labeled residue, indicating inactivation primarily due modification Cys151. propose GMPS-BDB (or AMPS-BDB), may exist enolized form aqueous solution, functions reactive analogue phosphoenolpyruvate GDP (ADP) target Cys151 active site pyruvate kinase.
