 Ruminococcus albus 7 played key role development concept interspecies hydrogen transfer. rumen bacterium ferments glucose 1.3 acetate, 0.7 ethanol, 2 CO2, 2.6 H2 growing batch culture 2 acetate, 2 CO2, 4 H2 growing continuous culture syntrophic association H2-consuming microorganisms keep H2 partial pressure low. organism uses NAD(+) ferredoxin glucose oxidation acetyl coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) CO2, NADH reduction acetyl-CoA ethanol, NADH reduced ferredoxin reduction protons H2. enzymes involved, enzyme catalyzing formation H2 NADH remained unknown. Here, report R. albus 7 grown batch culture glucose contained, besides ferredoxin-dependent [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydA2), ferredoxin- NAD-dependent electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydABC) couples endergonic formation H2 NADH exergonic formation H2 reduced ferredoxin. Interestingly, hydA2 adjacent hydS gene, predicted encode [FeFe]-hydrogenase C-terminal PAS domain. showed hydS hydA2 part larger transcriptional unit also harboring putative genes bifunctional acetaldehyde/ethanol dehydrogenase (Aad), serine/threonine protein kinase, serine/threonine protein phosphatase, redox-sensing transcriptional repressor. Since HydA2 Aad required R. albus grows high H2 partial pressures, HydS could H2-sensing [FeFe]-hydrogenase involved regulation biosynthesis.
