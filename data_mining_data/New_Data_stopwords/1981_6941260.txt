 Metabolism [3-13C]alanine presence absence beta-hydroxybutyrate ethanol followed 25 degrees C 13C NMR 90.5 MHz primary hepatocytes untreated rats rats treated triiodothyronine allowed eat 24 hr. phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate futile cycle followed situ comparing concentration 13C scrambled alanine C2 position glucose C5. absence ethanol, flux pyruvate kinase 60% gluconeogenic flux hepatocytes hyperthyroid rats, compared 25% controls. Incubation ethanol reduced pyruvate kinase flux hyperthyroid state measured controls. conditions, relative concentration label aspartate C2 C3 sites 1:2, whereas corresponding carbons glutamate, randomization almost complete. observations, require flux unscrambled label aspartate, consistent intramitochondrial synthesis aspartate incomplete mixing intramitochondrial oxaloacetate pool. 13C enrichment measured ketone bodies increased presence exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate. greater labeling observe C2 beta-hydroxybutyrate compared C4 condition explained flow 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme synthase.
