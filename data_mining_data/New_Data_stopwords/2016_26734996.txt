 last 5 years, novel knowledge tumor metabolism revealed identification critical factors fuel tumors. Alpha-enolase (ENO1) commonly over-expressed tumors clinically relevant candidate molecular target immunotherapy. Here, silenced ENO1 human cancer cell lines evaluated impact proteomic, biochemical functional approaches. ENO1 silencing increased reactive oxygen species mainly generated sorbitol NADPH oxidase pathways, well autophagy catabolic pathway adaptations, together affect cancer cell growth induce senescence. findings represent first comprehensive metabolic analysis following ENO1 silencing. Inhibition ENO1, either alone, combination pathways perturbed ENO1 silencing, opens novel avenues future therapeutic approaches.
