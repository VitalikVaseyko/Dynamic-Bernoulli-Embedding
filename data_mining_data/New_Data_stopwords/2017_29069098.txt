 METHODS: quantified 378 HRMAS 1H NMR spectra human brain tumours (132 glioblastomas, 101 astrocytomas, 75 meningiomas, 37 oligodendrogliomas 33 metastases) eTumour database looked metabolic interactions metabolite-metabolite correlation analysis (MMCA). RESULTS: tumour types showed remarkably similar metabolic correlations. Lactate correlated positively alanine, glutamate glutamine; creatine + phosphocreatine (tCr) correlated positively lactate, alanine choline + phosphocholine + glycerophosphocholine (tCho), tCho correlated positively lactate; fatty acids correlated negatively lactate, glutamate + glutamine (tGlut), tCr tCho. Oligodendrogliomas fewer correlations still fitted pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Possible explanations include (i) glycolytic tumour cells (the Warburg effect) generating pyruvate converted lactate, alanine, glutamate glutamine; (ii) association elevated glycolysis increased choline turnover membranes; (iii) increase tCr pool facilitate phosphocreatine-driven glutamate uptake; (iv) lipid signals come cytosolic lipid droplets necrotic pre-necrotic tumour tissue lower concentrations anabolic catabolic metabolites. Additional metabolite exchanges host cells may also involved. tumours co-opt standard set biochemical mechanisms grow brain, drugs might developed disrupt mechanisms.
