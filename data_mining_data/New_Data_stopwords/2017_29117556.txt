 Aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect, hallmark cancerous tissues. Despite importance cancer development, understanding mechanisms driving form metabolic reprogramming incomplete. report analysis colorectal cancer cells engineered carry single point mutation active site Mediator-associated kinase CDK8, creating hypomorphic alleles sensitive bulky ATP analogs. Transcriptome analysis revealed CDK8 kinase activity required expression many components glycolytic cascade. CDK8 inhibition impairs glucose transporter expression, glucose uptake, glycolytic capacity reserve, well cell proliferation anchorage-independent growth, normoxia hypoxia. Importantly, CDK8 impairment sensitizes cells pharmacological glycolysis inhibition, result reproduced Senexin A, dual inhibitor CDK8/CDK19. Altogether, results contribute understanding CDK8 oncogene, justify investigations target CDK8 highly glycolytic tumors.
