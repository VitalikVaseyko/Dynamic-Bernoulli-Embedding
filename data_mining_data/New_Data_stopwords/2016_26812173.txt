 Drosophila mutant tko25t exhibits deficiency mitochondrial protein synthesis, leading global insufficiency respiration oxidative phosphorylation. entrains organismal phenotype developmental delay sensitivity seizures induced mechanical stress. found mutant phenotype exacerbated dose-dependent fashion high dietary sugar levels. tko25t larvae found exhibit severe metabolic abnormalities accentuated high-sugar diet. include elevated pyruvate lactate, decreased ATP NADPH. Dietary pyruvate lactate supplementation phenocopied effects high sugar. Based tissue-specific rescue, crucial tissue metabolic crisis initiates gut. accompanied down-regulation apparatus cytosolic protein synthesis secretion RNA post-translational levels, including novel regulation S6 kinase protein level.
