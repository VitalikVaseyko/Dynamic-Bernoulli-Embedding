 1. aims present study examine response murine heart ischaemia reperfusion determine whether responses influenced strain mouse. 2. Isolated, paced (600 b.p.m.) murine (T/O mice) hearts perfused aerobically (2.6 mL/min) buffer 40 min subjected whole-heart (global) ischaemia (37 degrees C) 20, 30, 35, 40 50 min prior 90 min reperfusion. Contracture measured ischaemia reperfusate collected assayed creatine kinase. 3. increasing durations ischaemia, progressive decline postischaemic recovery left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) 20, 30, 35, 40 50 min ischaemia 75 +/- 4, 65 +/- 4, 38 +/- 6, 18 +/- 2 18 +/- 2% pre-ischaemic controls, respectively. 4. reciprocal increase creatine kinase leakage, indicative time-dependent increase tissue injury. 5. compare ischaemic vulnerability different strains, hearts Swiss C57BL/6 mice perfused 20 min, followed 40 min global ischaemia (37 degrees C) 60 min reperfusion. Functional recovery LVDP Swiss mouse hearts significantly higher C57BL/6 mouse hearts (39 +/- 7 vs 20 +/- 4%, respectively; P < 0.04, t-test; 10 d.f.). 6. investigations, encountered characterized phenomenon 'contractile cycling' (cyclical patterns declining increasing left ventricular systolic pressure variable severity duration). 7. shown confounding phenomenon manifestation underlying metabolic disturbance unknown origin attenuated addition substrates, pyruvate acetate, standard glucose-containing perfusion buffer.
