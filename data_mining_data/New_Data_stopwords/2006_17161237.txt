 Pancreatic preservation important part diabetes management may occur improved peripheral insulin sensitivity attenuated low-grade adipose tissue inflammation. objective current study determine response obese, insulin-resistant fa/fa Zucker rats vs lean controls dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation respect pancreatic islet size, insulin resistance, markers inflammation adipose glucose uptake. Six-week-old fa/fa lean Zucker rats (n = 20 per genotype) fed either 1.5% CLA mixture control diet 8 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance testing conducted 7.5 weeks. Fasting serum haptoglobin, insulin, C-peptide assayed, select messenger RNA (mRNA) protein markers inflammation glucose metabolism measured adipose liver tissues. CLA-fed fa/fa Zucker rats smaller islet cell size, improved oral glucose tolerance insulinemia, attenuated serum haptoglobin levels compared control-fed fa/fa Zucker rats, despite differences body weight slightly higher visceral adipose mass. CLA alter insulin sensitivity islet size lean Zucker rats. CLA-fed fa/fa rats also greater adipose glucose transporter-4 mRNA less adipose tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA protein compared control-fed fa/fa rats. contrast, markers inflammation glucose metabolism including adipose macrophage inflammatory factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, liver pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 significantly changed. results suggest CLA supplementation preserved pancreatic function conjunction improved peripheral glucose use reduced inflammation fa/fa Zucker rats.
