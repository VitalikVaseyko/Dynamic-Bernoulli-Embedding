 Cellulase (Avicelase, Cel1) Streptomyces reticuli efficiently hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose (Avicel) cellobiose. synthesis enzyme found dependent presence insoluble Avicel either soluble hydroxyethylcellulose, cellooligomers, cellobiose. Glycerol various metabolizable mono- disaccharides repress Avicelase synthesis, whereas yeast extract inducing repressing effect. Glucose kinase required repression effect. course cultivation, S. reticuli secretes significant quantities acid, predominantly pyruvate succinate, reduce pH 4 commonly used media low buffering capacity. Comparative studies media low high buffering capacities revealed Avicelase synthesis strongly repressed low pH.
