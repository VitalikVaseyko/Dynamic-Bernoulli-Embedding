 study, effects citrate addition D-ribose production investigated batch culture transketolase-deficient strain, Bacillus subtilis EC2, shake flasks bioreactors. Batch cultures shake flasks 5-l reactor indicated supplementation 0.2-0.5 g l(-1) citrate enhanced D: -ribose production. B. subtilis EC2 cultivated 15-l reactor complex medium, D: -ribose concentration 70.9 g l(-1) ribose yield 0.497 mol mol(-1). strain grown medium supplemented 0.3 g l(-1) citrate, 83.4 g l(-1) D-ribose obtained, ribose yield increased 0.587 mol mol(-1). Addition citrate reduced activities pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase, increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Metabolic flux distribution stationary phase indicated citrate addition resulted increased fluxes pentose phosphate pathway TCA cycle, decreased fluxes glycolysis acetate pathways.
