 Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) omega-functionalized long-chain alkanethiolates gold films excellent model systems study interactions proteins organic surfaces. Monolayers containing mixtures hydrophobic (methyl-terminated) hydrophilic [hydroxyl-, maltose-, hexa(ethylene glycol)-terminated] alkanethiols tailored select specific degrees adsorption: amount protein adsorbed varies monotonically composition monolayer. hexa(ethylene glycol)-terminated SAMs effective resisting protein adsorption. ability create interfaces similar structures well-defined compositions make possible test hypotheses concerning protein adsorption.
