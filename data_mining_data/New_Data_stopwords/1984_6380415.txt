 acid extract rabbit liver contained M1-type pyruvate kinase inactivating activity, separated three fractions. optimal inactivation enzyme Fraction II (Mr 42,000) observed pH 5.5, inactivation completely prevented leupeptin antipain, pepstatin. Fraction III (Mr 22,000), hand, optimal inactivation enzyme observed pH 8-9, prevented inhibitors. kinetic properties, phosphoenolpyruvate, enzyme changed hyperbolic type sigmoidal type limited proteolysis Fractions II III. subunit molecular weight enzyme (57,300) decreased 55,800 via 56,400 former case 56,400 latter case.
