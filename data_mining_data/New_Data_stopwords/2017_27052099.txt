 Spatial organization metabolic enzymes allows substrate channeling, accelerates processing intermediates. Here, investigated effect substrate channeling flux partitioning metabolic branch point, focusing pyruvate metabolism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. platform strain channeling pyruvate flux, PYK1-Coh-Myc strain constructed PYK1 gene encoding pyruvate kinase tagged cohesin domain. using high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interaction, pyruvate-forming enzyme Pyk1 tethered heterologous pyruvate-converting enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase alpha-acetolactate synthase, produce lactic acid 2,3-butanediol, respectively. Pyruvate flux successfully redirected toward desired pathways, concomitant decrease ethanol production even without genetic attenuation ethanol-producing pathway. pyruvate channeling strategy led improvement 2,3-butanediol production 38%, showing limitation improving lactic acid production due reduced activity lactate dehydrogenase dockerin tagging.
