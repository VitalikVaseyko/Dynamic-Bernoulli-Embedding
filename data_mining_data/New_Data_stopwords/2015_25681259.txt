 Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress results imbalance load proteins entering secretory pathway ability ER fold process them. response ER stress mediated collection signaling pathways termed unfolded protein response, plays important roles development disease. show Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, ER stress induces coordinated change expression genes involved carbon metabolism. Genes encoding enzymes carry glycolysis up-regulated, whereas genes encoding proteins tricarboxylic acid cycle respiratory chain complexes down-regulated. unfolded protein response transcription factor Atf4 necessary up-regulation glycolytic enzymes Lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh). Furthermore, Atf4 binding motifs promoters genes could partially account regulation ER stress. Finally, flies up-regulated Ldh produced lactate subjected ER stress. Together, results suggest Atf4 mediates shift metabolism based oxidative phosphorylation one heavily reliant glycolysis, reminiscent aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect observed cancer proliferative cells.
