 cDNA clones rat R-type pyruvate kinase genomic clone encoding L- R-type isozyme mRNAs isolated. sequences compared L-type isozyme cDNA determine sequences mRNA protein R-type isozyme organizations L- R-type genes. Results showed R-type isozyme mRNA identical nucleotide sequence L-type except 5'-terminal region including coding sequence length 3'-untranslated region. sequence upstream 5th coding residue L-type replaced 98-nucleotide coding sequence plus 5'-untranslated region R-type isozyme. Therefore, R-type subunit consists 574 amino acids, 31 residues longer L-type amino terminus. pyruvate kinase L gene present single copy per haploid genome composed 12 exons 11 introns length 9.3 kilobase pairs. first (exon R) second (exon L) exons encode 5'-terminal sequences specific R- L-types, respectively. remaining downstream exons encode sequence common isozymes. last exon contains entire 3'-untranslated region, including several putative polyadenylation signals. Alternative use signals reported responsible generation multiple mRNA species L-type, whereas R-type uses first signal. cap site mapped 16 nucleotides upstream translation initiation site L-type, whereas multiple cap sites suggested R-type. canonical promoter TATA box identified upstream sequence exon L, exon R. Instead, 5'-flanking region exon R contained another promoter sequence CAT box. Thus, conclude L- R-type isozymes pyruvate kinase produced single gene use different promoters.
