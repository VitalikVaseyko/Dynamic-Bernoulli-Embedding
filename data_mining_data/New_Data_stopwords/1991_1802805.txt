 Nine enzyme activity variants one charge variant liver/erythrocyte pyruvate kinase found amongst laboratory wild mice. Four enzyme activity variants previously reported caused allelic differences structural gene, Pk-1s. Analysis two putative regulatory gene mutations reported, map at, close to, structural gene chromosome 3. One mutations, inbred strain SWR, tissue specific, affecting enzyme concentration liver erythrocyte other, arose mutation experiment, doubles enzyme concentration tissues. organization nomenclature [Pk-1] gene complex discussed compared organization comprehensively analysed gene complexes mouse.
