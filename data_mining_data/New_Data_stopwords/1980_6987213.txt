 1. water-soluble yeast enzymes tested, partially precipitated best presence high concentration salts ammonium sulfate sodium formate, adsorbed column cellulose presence concentrations salts, adsorbed enzymes chromatographically eluted decreasing concentration salts. 2. Even presence high concentration salts, adsorbed enzymes eluted urea "hydroxy-rich" reagents sucrose. 3. experimental conditions used, salt concentrations required elution adsorbed enzymes lower cellulose DEAE-cellulose, CM-cellulose, P-cellulose, indicating ion exchange groups, either cationic anionic, affected adsorption, although ion exchange groups DEAE-cellulose, CM-cellulose, P-cellulose weakly definitely functional ion exchangers even presence high concentrations salts. 4. principal attractive force cellulose enzyme deduced due hydrogen bonding. 5. hydrogen bond chromatography applied purification yeast enzymes.
