 Metabolism tumour cells adapted demands growing cell. Warburg effect increased use glutamine two well-known adaptations tumour metabolism. require transporters allow uptake substrates efflux products. Differentiated cells less reliant pathways result less vulnerable drugs curtail nutrient uptake. Thus drugs reduce nutrient uptake promising candidates tumour therapy. Detailed understanding tumour cell biology allow generation new chemotherapeutic drugs limited side effects.
