 Warburg coworkers (Warburg O, Posener K, Negelein E. Z Biochem 152: 319, 1924) first reported cancerous cells switch glucose metabolism oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis, switch important proliferation. Nothing known aerobic glycolysis cells asthma. objective study aerobic glycolysis human asthma role metabolic pathway airway hyperreactivity inflammation mouse model asthma. Human peripheral blood mouse spleen CD4 cells isolated negative selection. cell proliferation measured thymidine incorporation. Cytokines serum lactate measured ELISA. Mouse airway hyperreactivity inhaled methacholine measured FlexiVent apparatus. serum lactate concentration significantly elevated clinically stable asthmatic subjects compared healthy chronic obstructive pulmonary disease controls, negatively correlated forced expiratory volume 1 s. Proliferating CD4 cells human asthma mouse model asthma produced higher amounts lactate upon stimulation, suggesting heightened glycolytic activity. Lactate stimulated inhibited cell proliferation low high concentrations, respectively. Dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor aerobic glycolysis, inhibited lactate production, proliferation cells, production IL-5, IL-17, IFN-gamma, stimulated production IL-10 induction Foxp3. DCA also inhibited airway inflammation hyperreactivity mouse model asthma. conclude aerobic glycolysis increased asthma, promotes cell activation. Inhibition aerobic glycolysis blocks cell activation development asthma.
