 Effects prolactin(Prl), bromocriptine(Br), testosterone propionate (TP), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) combinations androgens Prl/Br maximum catalytic capacities seminal vesicular enzymes involved glycolytic pentose phosphate pathways castrated mature monkeys studied. Castration decreased activities enzymes studied hexokinase(HK), 6-phosphofructokinase(PFK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(G3PD), pyruvate kinase(PK), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase(6PGD) seminal vesicles. Prl restored activities enzymes normal values except G3PD. TP/DHT maintained enzyme activities normal tissue intact level. Prl given along androgens enhanced androgen action regard enzymes activities except G3PD. Br decreased enzymes Br androgens maintained enzyme activities normal level. Castration decreased significantly serum T/DHT titres Prl alter Prl levels. Prl+TP/DHT elevated Prl levels. Br alone decreased serum Prl, DHT titres, Br+TP/DHT decreased Prl, elevated maintained DHT levels. results suggest Prl direct well synergistic action androgens activities enzymes glycolysis pentose phosphate pathways seminal vesicles castrated monkeys.
