 stereochemical course reaction catalyzed EcoRV restriction endonuclease determined. endonuclease recognizes GATATC sequence cuts central dA bases. Rp isomer d(GACGATsATCGTC) (this dodecamer contains phosphorothioate rather usual phosphate group central dA residues, indicated s) substrate endonuclease. Performing reaction H2 18O gave [18O]dps(ATCGTC) (a pentamer containing 18O-labeled 5'-phosphorothioate) converted [18O]dAMPS nuclease P1. deoxynucleoside 5'-[18O]phosphorothioate stereospecifically converted [18O]dATP alpha adenylate kinase pyruvate kinase [Brody, R. S., & Frey, P. A. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1245-1251]. Analysis position 18O product 31P NMR spectroscopy showed bridging position alpha- beta-phosphorus atoms. indicates EcoRV hydrolysis proceeds inversion configuration phosphorus. simplest interpretation mechanism endonuclease involves direct in-line attack phosphorus H2O trigonal bipyramidal transition state. covalent enzyme oligodeoxynucleotide species discounted intermediate. identical result previously observed EcoR1 endonuclease [Connolly, B. A., Eckstein, F., & Pingoud, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10760-10763]. X-ray crystallography shown endonucleases contain conserved array amino acids active sites. Possible mechanistic roles conserved amino acids light stereochemical findings discussed.
