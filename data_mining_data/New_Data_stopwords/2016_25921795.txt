 Rainbow smelt flourish -1.8 degrees C, freezing point sea water. antifreeze protein contributes freeze point depression but, importantly, cryoprotection due elevation osmotic pressure, accumulation glycerol. lower water temperature, higher plasma glycerol levels recorded high 400 mmol l(-1). Glycerol freely diffuses direct relation glycerol concentration fish may lose much 15% glycerol reserve per day. Glycerol levels decrease maximum February/March water temperature still sub-zero. decrease glycerol may respond photoperiod signal opposed initiation triggered low temperature. initial increase glycerol level supported liver glycogen high sustained glycerol level dependent upon dietary carbohydrate protein. metabolic pathways leading glycerol involve flux glycogen/glucose level dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) via initial part glycolysis amino acids via truncated gluconeogenesis level DHAP. DHAP turn converted glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) directly glycerol. key directing DHAP G3P highly active glycerol 3-P dehydrogenase. G3P converted directly glycerol via G3P phosphatase, rate-limiting step process. transition glycerol production associated increased activities enzymes key loci top part glycogenolysis/glycolysis. Curtailment final section glycolysis may reside level pyruvate oxidation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) driven increased levels PDH kinase. Enzymes associated amino acid trafficking elevated pivotal enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.
