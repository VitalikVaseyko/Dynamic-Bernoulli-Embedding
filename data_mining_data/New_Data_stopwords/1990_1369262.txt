 production D-ribulose-5-phosphate enzyme membrane reactor examined. Phosphoryl transfer ATP D-ribulose catalysed D-ribulokinase isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae. production D-ribulose-5-phosphate phosphoryl donor ATP used either stoichiometric catalytic amounts. Using catalytic amounts ATP requires second enzyme, e.g. pyruvate kinase, regenerate ATP. kinetic parameters D-ribulokinase pyruvate kinase determined calculate performance enzyme membrane reactor continuous production D-ribulose-5-phosphate. processes operated 200 h. Regardless whether ATP used catalytic stoichiometric amounts, production parameters determined. continuous production space/time yields 117 g (with ATP regeneration) 103 g (without ATP regeneration) D-ribulose-5-phosphate l -1 per day reached.
