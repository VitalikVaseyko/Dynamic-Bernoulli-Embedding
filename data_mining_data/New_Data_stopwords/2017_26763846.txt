 patients pulmonary arterial hypertension die right ventricular failure (RVF). Right ventricular (RV) myocardial apoptosis important role RVF regulated mitochondria. Dichloroacetate (DCA) improve cardiac function RVF, whether regulate myocardial apoptosis via mitochondria still unknown. study, investigated effects DCA myocardial mitochondria, mitochondrial apoptosis aspects RV remodeling, including fibrosis capillary rarefaction. RVF induced rats single s.c. injection monocrotaline. 4 weeks, DCA treatment started i.p. injection 50, 150 2007 mg kg(-1) per day 14 days. Compared saline-treated RVF animals, treatment DCA resulted decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure total pulmonary resistance (TPR), increased cardiac output. expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase suppressed, pyruvate dehydrogenase expression upregulated DCA application. DCA treatment also associated restored RV mitochondrial function reduction RV hypertrophy, fibrosis, capillary rarefaction apoptosis. Mitochondria-dependent apoptosis involved DCA regulation RV. absent correlation TPR main parameters RV suggests effects DCA two organ systems independent. conclude DCA improves cardiac function experimental RVF partly reversing RV remodeling, restoring mitochondrial function regulating mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. study shows fear increased RV apoptosis DCA treatment unnecessary suggests potential role DCA treatment RVF.
