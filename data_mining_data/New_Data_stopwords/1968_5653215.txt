 hemolytic disorder mild hyperbilirubinemia reticulocytosis 6 15% documented eight members large family Dominican Republic presumed present eight members. disorder appeared inherited autosomal dominant characteristic. Analysis phospholipids quantitative thinlayer chromatography revealed distinct increase phosphatidyl choline (lecithin) 35.5 +/- SD 1.3% total (normal: 28.2 +/- 1.4%) erythrocytes affected members family, cells unaffected relatives. alteration appeared constitute absolute increase lecithin content, rather decrease phospholipids. Erythrocytes patients varieties hereditary hemolytic disorders comparable levels reticulocytosis normal phospholipid compositions. Plasma lipids six affected members family unusual respect total lipid weight, total phospholipid, cholesterol. Three patients liver disease jaundice found marked increases lecithin content erythrocytes, also extremely high plasma levels total lipid, phospholipids, cholesterol. Osmotic fragility erythrocytes affected patients decreased increase fragility incubation 24 hr less observed normal erythrocytes. Autohemolysis 48 hr slightly increased corrected nearly normal addition glucose. activities 15 enzymes erythrocytes propositus normal elevated adenosine triphosphate content normal. abnormal hemoglobin could demonstrated. life span isologous erythrocytes propositus reduced, homologous erythrocytes survived normally.A causal relationship altered phospholipid composition hemolytic disorder established.
