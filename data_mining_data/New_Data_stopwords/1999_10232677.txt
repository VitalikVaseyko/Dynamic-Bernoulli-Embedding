 final control sodium balance takes place cortical collecting duct (CCD) nephron, corticosteroid hormones regulate sodium reabsorption acting mineralocorticoid (MR) and/or glucocorticoid (GR) receptors. clone principal CCD cells (mpkCCDc14) established derived transgenic mouse (SV40 large antigen control SV40 enhancer/L-type pyruvate kinase promoter). Cells grown filters form polarized monolayers high electrical transepithelial resistance (R(T) approximately 4700 ohm x cm2) potential difference (P(D) approximately -50 mV) amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium transport, assessed short-circuit current method (Isc approximately 11 microA/cm2). Reverse transcription-PCR experiments using rat MR primers, [3H]aldosterone, [3H]dexamethasone binding competition studies indicated mpkCCDc14 cells exhibit specific MR GR. Aldosterone increased Isc dose- (10(-10) 10(-6) M) time-dependent (2 72 h) manner, whereas corticosterone transiently increased Isc (2 6 h). Consistent expression 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, metabolizes glucocorticoids inactive 11-dehydroderivates, carbenoxolone potentiated corticosterone-stimulated Isc. Aldosterone (5x10(-7) M)-induced Isc (fourfold) associated three- fivefold increase alpha-ENaC mRNA (but beta- gamma-ENaC) three- 10-fold increases alpha-ENaC protein synthesis. conclusion, new immortalized mammalian CCD clonal cell line retained high level epithelial differentiation sodium transport stimulated aldosterone therefore represents useful mammalian cell system identifying genes controlled aldosterone.
