 computational study large biomolecular complexes (molecular machines, cytoskeletal filaments, etc.) formidable challenge facing computational biophysics biology. achieve biologically relevant length time scales, coarse-grained (CG) models complexes usually must built employed. One important early stages approach determine optimal number CG sites different constituents complex. work presents systematic approach problem. First, universal scaling law derived numerically corroborated intensity intrasite (intradomain) thermal fluctuations function number CG sites. Second, result used derivation criterion optimal number CG sites different parts large multibiomolecule complex. zeroth-order approximation, approach validates empirical rule taking one CG site per fixed number atoms residues biomolecule, previously widely used smaller systems (e.g., individual biomolecules). first-order corrections rule derived numerically checked case studies Escherichia coli ribosome Arp2/3 actin filament junction. different ribosomal proteins, optimal number amino acids per CG site shown differ factor 3.5, even wider spread may exist large biomolecular complexes. Therefore, method proposed paper valuable optimal construction CG models complexes.
