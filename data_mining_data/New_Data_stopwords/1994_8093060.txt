 present novel useful principle applied enzyme reactions dilute substrates enables obtain desired time-course curve reverse reaction latter measured easily. Let us imagine enzyme mixture catalyze interconversion substances A, B, C,.... one substance (sufficiently dilute) added mixture substrate time-course curve concentration another substance followed, then, "the time-course curve A-->B" (which time-course curve concentration substance B substance added substrate) reverse reaction B-->A coincide plotted appropriate scales magnitude. Similar relation holds pair substances even widely separated type reaction scheme. principle proved mathematically holds first-order reaction network applied enzyme reaction dilute substrate reduced first-order reaction network. example experimental application principle also given.
