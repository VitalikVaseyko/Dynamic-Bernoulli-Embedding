 Sodium pyruvate dinitrophenol stimulated O(2) uptake freshly cut phloem parenchyma carrot roots 63 120% optimal concentrations, indicating production pyruvate glycolysis regulates over-all respiratory rate. Adding 0.5 6.7 mm Na(3)ADP Na(3)ATP slices rapidly stimulates respiration rate 20 85%. effect greater lower end concentration range due change pH active cation uptake. suggested treating tissue nucleotides stimulates pyruvate kinase, rate-limiting step respiration freshly cut slices, increasing concentration endogenous ADP. Adenosine diphosphate continued stimulate O(2) uptake peak induced respiration, ATP inhibited respiration development decline peak. Absence respiratory stimulation NaH(2)PO(4) respiratory inhibition added nucleosides confirms inorganic phosphate limiting factor respiration freshly cut slices. stimulation respiration rate slices dinitrophenol consistent results experiments ADP ATP applied tissue.
