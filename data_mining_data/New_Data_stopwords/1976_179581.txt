 1. Oral administration ethanol (3 ml) 95% 12 ml total volume two day period) significantly decrease plasma glucose insulin levels activities two key gluconeogenic enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate: CO2 ligase (ADP), EC 6.4.1.1) fructose diphosphatase, (D-Fru-1,6-P2 1-phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.11), one glycolytic enzyme, fructose-1,6-P2 aldolase (Fru-1,6-P2 D-glyceraldehyde-3-P lyase, EC 4.1.2.13). instance, administration 2400 mug daily oral folate conjuction ethanol prevented alterations carbohydrate metabolism. 2. Intravenous injection ethanol produced rapid decrease (within 10--15 min) activities hepatic phosphofructokinase, (ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase, (ATP:pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40), fructose diphosphatase fructose-1,6-P2 aldolase. 3. Intravenous ethanol significantly increased hepatic cyclic AMP concentration approximately 60% within 10 min, oral ethanol alter hepatic cyclic AMP concentrations. 4. data confirm known antagonism ethanol folate suggest oral folate might offer protective effect hypoglycemia rats receiving ethanol.
