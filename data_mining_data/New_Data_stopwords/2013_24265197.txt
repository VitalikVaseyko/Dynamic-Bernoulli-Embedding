 One principal biochemical characteristics malignant cells compared normal cells metabolic switch oxidative phosphorylation increased glycolysis, even hypoxic conditions, termed Warburg effect. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) catalyzes conversion pyruvate lactate considered key checkpoint anaerobic glycolysis. elevated many types cancers linked tumor growth, maintenance, invasion; therefore, inhibition may restrict energy supply tumors thereby reduce metastatic invasive potential cancer cells. enzyme receiving great deal attention potential diagnostic marker predictive biomarker many types cancer therapeutic target new anticancer treatments. review, summarize role LDHA cancer, discuss potential significance clinical diagnosis prognosis cancer, propose LDHA novel target inhibition tumor growth invasiveness.
