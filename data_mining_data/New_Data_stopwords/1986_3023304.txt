 Pyruvate dehydrogenase Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F partially purified soluble fraction bacterial sonicate, characterized. enzyme catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate produce acetyl-CoA, contrast statements current review articles acetyl phosphate indicated direct decomposition product pyruvate sulfate-reducing bacteria. established reaction stoichiometry is: pyruvate + CoA + FMN----acetyl-CoA + CO2 + FMNH2. Km values 2.9 mM pyruvate, 32 microM CoA 6.7 mumol FMN. Participation thiamine diphosphate enzymic process proven. 2-Oxobutyrate, 2-oxoglutarate, substitute pyruvate. three flavin compounds, FMN, FAD, flavodoxin, well clostridial ferredoxin, serve electron carriers enzyme. Thus enzyme kind pyruvate synthase [EC 1.2.7.1], acts direction pyruvate degradation growing cells. rate cytochrome C3 reduction extremely low, presence flavodoxin electron mediator, reduction rate cytochrome C3 becomes faster reduction rate flavodoxin alone. seems physiological electron acceptor enzyme flavodoxin, might complexed cytochrome C3 produce efficient electron transfer system cell. soluble fraction D. vulgaris cells proved contain, addition pyruvate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase (Ogata, M., Arihara, K., & Yagi, T. (1981) J. Biochem. 89, 1423-1431), phosphate acetyltransferase acetate kinase, i.e., enzymes necessary convert lactate acetate, producing ATP substrate level phosphorylation.
