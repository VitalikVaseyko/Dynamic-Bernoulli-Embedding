 Mutations coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) major cause human skeletal dysplasia Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS); however, mechanism mutations affect skeletal mineralization patterning unknown. Here, report identification 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) key regulator CBP activity demonstrate functions map osteoprogenitor cells mature osteoblasts. osteoblasts, PDK1 activated CREB/CBP complex, turn controlled runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) activation expression bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). pathways also operated vivo, evidenced recapitulation RTS spectrum phenotypes osteoblast-specific Pdk1 deletion mice (Pdk1osx mice) genetic interactions observed mice heterozygous osteoblast-specific Pdk1 deletion either Runx2 Creb deletion. Finally, treatment Pdk1osx Cbp+/- embryos BMPs utero partially reversed skeletal anomalies birth. findings illustrate vivo function PDK1-AKT-CREB/CBP pathway bone formation provide proof principle utero growth factor supplementation potential therapy skeletal dysplasias.
