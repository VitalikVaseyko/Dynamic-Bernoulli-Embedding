 Following onset moderate aerobic exercise, rate oxygen consumption (J(o)) rises monoexponentially toward new steady state time constant (tau) vicinity 30 s. mechanisms underlying delay studied several decades. Meyer's electrical analog model proposed concept tau given tau = R(m) x C, R(m) mitochondrial resistance energy transfer, C metabolic capacitance, determined primarily cellular total creatine pool (TCr = phosphocreatine + creatine). purpose study evaluate vitro J(o) kinetics isolated rat skeletal muscle mitochondria various levels TCr mitochondrial protein. Mitochondria incubated medium containing 5.0 mM ATP, TCr pools 0-1.5 mM, excess creatine kinase, ATP-splitting system glucose + hexokinase (HK). Pyruvate malate (1 mM each) present oxidative substrates. J(o) measured across time HK added elicit one two levels J(o) (40 60% state 3). TCr levels (in mM) 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.75, 1.5, corresponding tau values (s, means +/- SE) 22.2 +/- 3.0, 36.3 +/- 2.2, 65.7 +/- 4.3, 168.1 +/- 22.2, 287.3 +/- 25.9. Thus tau increased linearly TCr (R(2) = 0.916). Furthermore, experimentally observed tau varied linearly inversely mitochondrial protein added. vitro results consistently conform predictions Meyer's electrical analog model.
