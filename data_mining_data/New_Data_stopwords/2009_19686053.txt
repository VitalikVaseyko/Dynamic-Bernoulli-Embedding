 review current evidence role reactive oxygen species (ROS) intracellular redox state governing crucial steps metastatic process, cell detachment primary tumor final colonization distant site. particular, discuss redox-dependent aspects cell glycolytic metabolism (Warburg effect), cell juggling different motility styles (epithelial-to-mesenchymal mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition), cell resistance anoikis cell interaction stromal components metastatic niche. Central overview concept metastasis viewed integrated "escape program" triggered redox changes instrumental avoiding oxidative stress within primary tumor. novel perspective, metabolic, motility, prosurvival choices cell along entire metastatic process interpreted exploiting redox-signaling cascades monitor oxidative/reductive environmental cues escape oxidative damage. also propose theoretic framework applied "normal" evasion/invasion programs inflammation development. Furthermore, suggest intimate connection metastasis, inflammation, stem cells results, least part, sharing common redox-dependent strategy infiltration, survival, dissemination, patterning.
