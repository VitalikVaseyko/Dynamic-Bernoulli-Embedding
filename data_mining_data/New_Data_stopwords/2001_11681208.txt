 Two different strains mice different susceptibilities systemic candidiasis (BALB/c CBA/H) infected Candida albicans SC5314. Immune sera obtained different days post-infection assayed two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation cytoplasmic extracts obtained protoplasts. 31 immunoreactive proteins detected. identified found correspond (i) glycolytic enzymes, fructose biphosphate aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase (TPIS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), enolase (ENO1) pyruvate kinase, (ii) metabolic enzymes, methionine synthase (METE), inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMH3), alcohol dehydrogenase aconitate hydratase (iii) heat shock proteins: HS71 (or Ssa1p) HS75 (or Ssb1p), HSP70 family. work reports first time antigenic properties IMH3 TPIS. Different profiles antibody expression, depending mouse strain course infection, observed. ENO1 immunogenic protein infected BALB/c mice (the resistant strain). hand, sera CBA/H mice (a susceptible strain) showed strong increase reactivity along infection METE, HS75 PGK. Many immunoreactive proteins also detected using sera human patients systemic candidiasis, thus indicating usefulness murine model studying antibody response systemic candidiasis. work demonstrate combination two-dimensional electrophoresis immunoblotting using murine immune sera important tool identification C. albicans antigens monitoring evolution disease.
