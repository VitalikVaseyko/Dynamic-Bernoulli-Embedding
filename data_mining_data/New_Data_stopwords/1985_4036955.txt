 enzyme activities cultured early erythroid progenitor cells (burst-forming unit erythroid, BFU-E) measured compared activities mature erythrocytes. enzyme activity acetylcholinesterase detectable erythroblasts. ratios phosphofructokinase glutathione peroxidase low due low enzyme activities erythroblasts erythrocytes. ratios triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, adenylate kinase low due high enzyme activities erythroblasts erythrocytes. ratios hexokinase, glucose phosphate isomerase, monophosphoglyceromutase, pyruvate kinase, adenosine deaminase high due high enzyme activities erythroblasts. isozyme erythroblast hexokinase prototype isozyme I, pyruvate kinase predominantly prototype M2, two hybrid isozymes anodal side electrophoresis. facts suggest greatly different metabolic pattern maturation erythroid cells.
