 Cancer cells must carefully regulate metabolism maintain growth division varying nutrient oxygen levels. Compelling data support investigation numerous enzymes therapeutic targets exploit metabolic vulnerabilities common several cancer types. discuss rationale developing drugs review three targets central roles metabolic pathways crucial cancer cell growth: pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme splice variant 2 (PKM2) glycolysis, glutaminase glutaminolysis, mutations isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 2 isozymes (IDH1/2) tricarboxylic acid cycle. targets exemplify drugging approach cancer metabolism, allosteric modulation common theme. first glutaminase mutant IDH1/2 inhibitors entered clinical testing, early data promising. Cancer metabolism provides wealth novel targets, targeting allosteric sites promises yield selective drugs potential transform clinical outcomes across many cancer types.
