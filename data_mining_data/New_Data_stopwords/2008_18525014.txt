 hypothesize variations dietary carbohydrate levels produce changes glucosensor parameters previously characterized glucosensing areas (hypothalamus hindbrain) related regulation food intake carnivorous fish species like rainbow trout. Therefore, fed trout standard, carbohydrate-free (CF) high-carbohydrate (HC) diets 10 days assess changes glucosensing system food intake. Fish fed CF diet displayed hypoglycemia increased food intake. Fish fed HC diet displayed hyperglycemia decreased food intake. Changes food intake due dietary carbohydrates accompanied hypothalamus hindbrain fish fed HC diet changes parameters involved glucosensing, increased glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, glycogen levels increased glucokinase (GK), glycogen synthase, pyruvate kinase activities well increased GK GLUT2 expression. results address first time fish, despite relative intolerance glucose carnivorous species, dietary carbohydrates important regulators glucosensing system carnivorous fish, suggesting information generated system associated changes observed food intake.
