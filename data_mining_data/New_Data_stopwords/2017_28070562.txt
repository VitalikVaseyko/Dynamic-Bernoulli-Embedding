 catalase-negative, facultative anaerobe Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 naturally resistant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced endogenously pyruvate oxidase (SpxB). Here, investigate adaptive response endogenously produced H2O2. show lactate oxidase, converts lactate pyruvate, positively impacts pyruvate flux SpxB DeltalctO mutants produce significantly lower H2O2. addition, SpxB pathway candidate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) pathway contribute acetyl coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) production aerobic growth, pyruvate format lyase (PFL) pathway major acetyl-CoA pathway anaerobic growth. Microarray analysis D39 strain cultured aerobic versus strict anaerobic conditions shows upregulation spxB, gene encoding rhodanese-like protein (locus tag spd0091), tpxD, sodA, piuB, piuD, Fe-S protein biogenesis operon H2O2-producing conditions. Proteome profiling H2O2-induced sulfenylation reveals sulfenylation levels correlate cellular H2O2 production, endogenous sulfenylation approximately 50 proteins. Deletion tpxD increases cellular sulfenylation 5-fold inhibitory effect ATP generation. Two major targets protein sulfenylation glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA) SpxB itself, targets also include pyruvate kinase, LctO, AdhE, acetate kinase (AckA). Sulfenylation GapA inhibitory, effect SpxB activity negligible. Strikingly, four enzymes capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis sulfenylated, enzymes associated nucleotide biosynthesis via ribulose-5-phosphate. propose LctO/SpxB-generated H2O2 functions signaling molecule downregulate capsule production drive altered flux sugar utilization pathways. IMPORTANCE Adaptation endogenous oxidative stress integral aspect Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization virulence. work, identify key transcriptomic proteomic features pneumococcal endogenous oxidative stress response. thiol peroxidase TpxD plays critical role adaptation endogenous H2O2 serves limit protein sulfenylation glycolytic, capsule, nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes S. pneumoniae.
