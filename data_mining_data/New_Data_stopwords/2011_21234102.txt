 Metallothionein 3 (MT-3), also known growth inhibitory factor (GIF), exhibits neuroinhibitory activity. lab others previously shown biological activity involves interacting protein partners brain. However, nothing specific yet known interactions responsible GIF activity. paper, reporting upon new proteins found interacting MT-3 determined immunoaffinity chromatography mass spectrometry. new partner proteins-Exo84p, 14-3-3 Zeta, alpha beta Enolase, Aldolase C, Malate dehydrogenase, ATP synthase, Pyruvate kinase-along previously identified classified three functional groups: transport signaling, chaperoning scaffolding, glycolytic metabolism. viewed together, interactions support proposed model regulation GIF activity MT-3.
