 interaction soluble mitochondrial ATPase beef heart natural ATPase inhibitor studied. found phosphorylation small amounts ADP phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase, ensuing catalytic cycle supports binding inhibitor enzyme. association inhibitor F1-ATPase increase content ATP F1-ATPase-inhibitor complex. inhibitor catalytic activity bathophenanthroline-Fe2+ chelate prevents interaction, association inhibitor F1-ATPase delayed reaction carried 2H2O. date indicate transient state involved catalytic cycle form enzyme interacts inhibitor. proton-motive force-induced dissociation inhibitor particulate ATPase prevented bathophenanthroline-Fe2+ chelate nitrobenzofurazan chloride, indicates functional catalytic (beta) subunit required proton-motive force-induced release inhibitor. data suggest direct involvement catalytic (beta) subunit mechanism F1-ATPase senses proton-motive force.
