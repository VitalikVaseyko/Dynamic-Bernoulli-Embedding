 Phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase Brassica nigra leaf petiole suspension cells purified 1700-fold apparent homogeneity final specific activity 380 micromole pyruvate produced per minute per milligram protein. Purification steps included: ammonium sulfate fractionation, S-Sepharose, chelating Sepharose, concanavalin Sepharose, Superose 12 chromatography. native protein monomeric molecular mass 56 kilodaltons estimated analytical gel filtration. enzyme displayed broad pH optimum pH 5.6 relatively heat stable. Western blots microgram quantities final preparation showed cross-reactivity probed rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared either castor bean endosperm cytosolic pyruvate kinase, sorghum leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. final preparation exhibited broad substrate selectivity, showing high activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, gluconate 6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, moderate activity toward several organic phosphates. Phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase possessed least fivefold sixfold greater affinity specificity constant, respectively, phosphoenolpyruvate (apparent Michaelis constant = 50 micromolar) nonartificial substrate. enzyme activated 1.7-fold 4 millimolar magnesium, strongly inhibited molybdate, fluoride, zinc, copper, iron, lead ions, well orthophosphate, ascorbate, glutamate, aspartate, various organic phosphate compounds. postulated phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase functions bypass adenosine diphosphate dependent pyruvate kinase reaction extended periods orthophosphate starvation.
