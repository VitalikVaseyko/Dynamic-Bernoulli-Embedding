 Classical actions insulin involve increased glucose uptake bloodstream metabolism peripheral tissues, important relevant effects human health. However, nonoxidative oxidative glucose disposal activation glycogen synthase (GS) mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) remain incompletely explained current models insulin action. Since discovery insulin receptor Tyr kinase activity 25 years ago, dominant paradigm intracellular signaling insulin invokes protein phosphorylation downstream receptor primary Tyr phosphorylated substrates-the insulin receptor substrate family proteins. scheme accounts most, all, intracellular actions insulin. Essentially forgotten previous literature continuing work second messengers generated cells response insulin. Treatment even prevention diabetes metabolic syndrome benefit complete elucidation cellular-signaling events activated insulin, include actions second messengers glycan molecules contain D-chiro-inositol (DCI). metabolism DCI associated insulin sensitivity resistance, supporting concept second messengers role responses resistance insulin.
