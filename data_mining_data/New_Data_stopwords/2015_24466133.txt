 OBJECTIVES: RhoA/ROCK pathway contributes diabetic cardiomyopathy part promoting sustained activation PKCbeta2 details interaction unclear. purpose study investigate over-activation ROCK diabetic heart leads direct phosphorylation activation PKCbeta2, determine interaction affects PDK-1/Akt signaling. METHODS: Regulation ROCK PKCbeta2 related kinases investigated Western blotting co-immunoprecipitation whole hearts isolated cardiomyocytes 12 14-week diabetic rats. Direct ROCK2 phosphorylation PKCbeta2 examined vitro. siRNA silencing used confirm role ROCK2 PKCbeta2 phosphorylation vascular smooth muscle cells cultured high glucose. Furthermore, effect ROCK inhibition GLUT4 translocation determined isolated cardiomyocytes confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Expression ROCK2 expression phosphorylation PKCbeta2 increased diabetic hearts. physical interaction two kinases demonstrated reciprocal immunoprecipitation, ROCK2 directly phosphorylated PKCbeta2 T641 vitro. ROCK2 siRNA vascular smooth muscle cells inhibition ROCK diabetic hearts reduced PKCbeta2 T641 phosphorylation, associated attenuation PKCbeta2 activity. PKCbeta2 also formed complex PDK-1 target AKT, ROCK inhibition resulted upregulation phosphorylation PDK-1 AKT, increased translocation glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) plasma membrane diabetic hearts. CONCLUSION: study demonstrates over-activation ROCK2 contributes diabetic cardiomyopathy multiple mechanisms, including direct phosphorylation activation PKCbeta2 interference PDK-1-mediated phosphorylation activation AKT translocation GLUT4. suggests ROCK2 critical node development diabetic cardiomyopathy may effective target improve cardiac function diabetes.
