 Aerobic respiration required optimal efficiency metabolism mammalian cells. circumstances oxygen utilization impaired, cells survive anerobic metabolism. malignant cell cultivated use anerobic metabolism aerobic environment, Warburg effect, explanation preference clear. paper presents evidence deficiency enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase), either innate acquired, helps explain Warburg phenomenon. ARSB enzyme removes 4-sulfate groups non-reducing end chondroitin 4-sulfate dermatan sulfate. Previous reports indicated reduced ARSB activity malignancy replication effects hypoxia decline ARSB. Hypoxia reduced ARSB activity, since molecular oxygen needed post-translational modification ARSB. report, studies performed human HepG2 cells hepatocytes ARSB-deficient normal C57BL/6J control mice. Decline ARSB, presence oxygen, profoundly reduced oxygen consumption rate increased extracellular acidification rate, indicating preference aerobic glycolysis. Specific study findings indicate decline ARSB activity enhanced aerobic glycolysis impaired normal redox processes, consistent critical role ARSB sulfate reduction mammalian metabolism.
