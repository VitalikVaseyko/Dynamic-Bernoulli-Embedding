 BACKGROUND: Activation renin-angiotensin sympathetic nervous systems may alter cardiac energy substrate preference, thereby contributing progression heart failure normal ejection fraction. assessed qualitative quantitative effects angiotensin II (Ang II) alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PE), cardiac energy metabolism experimental models hypertrophy diastolic dysfunction role Ang II type 1 receptor. METHODS RESULTS: Ang II (1.5 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) PE (40 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) administered 9-week-old male C57/BL6 wild-type mice 14 days via implanted microosmotic pumps. Echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy diastolic dysfunction, preserved systolic function Ang II- PE-treated mice. Ang II induced marked reduction cardiac glucose oxidation lactate oxidation, change glycolysis fatty acid beta-oxidation. Tricarboxylic acid acetyl coenzyme production ATP production reduced response Ang II. Cardiac pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression upregulated Ang II PE, resulting reduction pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, rate-limiting step carbohydrate oxidation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 upregulation correlated activation cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase-retinoblastoma protein-E2F pathway response Ang II. Ang II type 1 receptor blockade normalized activation cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase-retinoblastoma protein-E2F pathway prevented reduction glucose oxidation increased fatty acid oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Ang II- PE-induced hypertrophy diastolic dysfunction associated reduced glucose oxidation cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase-retinoblastoma protein-E2F-induced upregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, targeting pathways may provide novel therapy heart failure normal ejection fraction.
