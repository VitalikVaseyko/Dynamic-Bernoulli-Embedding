 Warburg Micro Syndrome rare, autosomal recessive syndrome characterized microcephaly, microphthalmia, microcornia, congenital cataracts, optic atrophy, cortical dysplasia, particular corpus callosum hypoplasia, severe mental retardation, spastic diplegia, hypogonadism. found five new mutations RAB3GAP1 gene seven patients suspected Micro Syndrome families Turkish, Palestinian, Danish, Guatemalan backgrounds. thorough clinical investigation patients allowed delineation symptoms consistently present patients may aid differential diagnosis Micro Syndrome patients future. patients postnatal microcephaly, micropthalmia, microcornia, bilateral congenital cataracts, short palpebral fissures, optic atrophy, severe mental retardation, congenital hypotonia subsequent spasticity. one patient microcephaly birth, highlighting fact congenital microcephaly consistent feature Micro syndrome. Analysis brain magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) revealed consistent pattern polymicrogyria frontal parietal lobes, wide sylvian fissures, thin hypoplastic corpus callosum, increased subdural spaces. patients homozygous mutations detected mutations predicted result truncated RAB3GAP1 protein. analysis nine polymorphic markers flanking RAB3GAP1 gene showed mutation c.1410C>A (p.Tyr470X), Danish patient homozygous, occurred haplotype shared unrelated heterozygous parents patient. suggests possible founder effect mutation Danish population.
