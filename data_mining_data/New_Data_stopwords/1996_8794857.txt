 Nup153 large (153 kD) O-linked glyco-protein component basket structure located nucleoplasmic face nuclear pore complexes. protein exhibits tripartite structure consisting zinc finger domain flanked large (60-70 kD) NH2- COOH-terminal domains. full-length human Nup153 expressed BHK cells, accumulates appropriately nucleoplasmic face nuclear envelope. Targeting information Nup153 resides NH2-terminal domain since region molecule direct ordinarily cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, nuclear face nuclear pore complex. Overexpression Nup153 results dramatic accumulation nuclear poly (A)+ RNA, suggesting inhibition RNA export nucleus. due general decline nucleocytoplasmic transport occlusion loss nuclear pore complexes since nuclear protein import unaffected. overexpression certain Nup153 constructs found result formation unusual intranuclear membrane arrays, structural phenotype could correlated effects poly (A)+ RNA distribution. RNA trafficking defect was, however, dependent upon Nup153 COOH-terminal domain contains XFXFG repeats. proposed region Nup153, lying within distal ring nuclear basket, represents docking site mRNA molecules exiting nucleus.
