 L-tryptophan (L-trp) precursor various bioactive components great pharmaceutical interest. However, due requirement several precursors complex regulation pathways involved, development efficient L-trp production strain challenging. study, Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain KW001 designed overexpress L-trp operator sequences (trpEDCBA) 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (aroG (fbr) ). improve production L-trp, pyruvate kinase (pykF) phosphotransferase system HPr (ptsH) deleted inactivation repression (trpR) attenuation (attenuator) produce strain KW006. overcome relatively slow growth increase transport rate glucose, strain KW018 generated combinatorial regulation glucokinase (galP) galactose permease (glk) expression. reduce production acetic acid, strain KW023 created repressive regulation phosphate acetyltransferase (pta) expression. conclusion, strain KW023 efficiently produced 39.7 g/L L-trp conversion rate 16.7% productivity 1.6 g/L/h 5 L fed-batch fermentation system.
