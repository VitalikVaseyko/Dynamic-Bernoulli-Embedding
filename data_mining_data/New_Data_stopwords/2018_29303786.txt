 Neurodegenerative cells sites numerous metabolic energetic abnormalities abnormalities energy production. Energy primary determinant neuronal viability. neurodegenerative cells, metabolic enzymes modified dysregulation canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Huntington's disease (HD), WNT/beta-catenin pathway upregulated. focused review hypothesis aerobic glycolysis stimulated upregulation WNT/beta-catenin pathway ALS HD. Upregulation WNT/beta-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, activation glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A), inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Aerobic glycolysis consists supply large part glucose lactate regardless oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis less efficient terms ATP production compared oxidative phosphorylation shunt TCA cycle. Dysregulation energetic metabolism promotes cell death disease progression ALD HD. Aerobic glycolysis regulation attractive mechanism developing therapeutic interventions.
