 response Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism genetic environmental manipulation studied use recently developed methodology metabolic flux ratio (METAFoR) analysis; methodology also directly reveal active metabolic pathways. Generation fluxome data arrays use METAFoR approach based two-dimensional (13)C-(1)H correlation nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy fractionally labeled biomass and, contrast metabolic flux analysis, require measurements extracellular substrate metabolite concentrations. METAFoR analyses E. coli strains moderately overexpress phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase revealed flux ratios change concert overexpression enzymes. Disruption pyruvate kinase isoenzymes resulted altered flux ratios reactions connecting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate pools significantly alter central metabolism. data indicate remarkable robustness rigidity central carbon metabolism presence genetic variation. significant physiological changes flux ratio differences seen response altered environmental conditions. example, ammonia-limited chemostat cultures, compared glucose-limited chemostat cultures, reduced fraction PEP molecules derived least one transketolase reaction, higher relative contribution anaplerotic PEP carboxylation tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxaloacetate synthesis. two parameters also showed significant variation aerobic anaerobic batch cultures. Finally, two reactions catalyzed PEP carboxykinase malic enzyme identified METAFoR analysis; previously considered absent E. coli cells grown glucose-containing media. Backward flux TCA cycle glycolysis, indicated significant activity PEP carboxykinase, found glucose-limited chemostat culture, demonstrating control futile cycle activity relaxed severe glucose limitation.
