 bacterium Lactococcus lactis become model organism studies growth physiology membrane transport, result simple fermentative metabolism. also used model studying importance specific genes functions life excess nutrients, comparison prototrophic wild-type strains auxotrophic domesticated (dairy) strains. study capacity domesticated strains perform directed responses toward various stress conditions, analyzed heat salt stress response established L. lactis subsp. cremoris laboratory strain MG1363, originally derived dairy strain. two-dimensional separation proteins, DnaK, GroEL, GroES heat shock proteins, HrcA (Orf1) heat shock repressor, glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase, glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase identified combination Western blotting direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing proteins gels. 400 500 visible proteins, 17 induced twofold heat stress. Two classes heat stress proteins identified temporal induction pattern. fast-induced proteins (including DnaK) showed abruptly increased rate synthesis first 10 min, declining intermediate levels 15 min. GroEL GroES, also belong group, maintained high rate synthesis 15 min. class slowly induced proteins exhibited gradual increase rate synthesis onset stress. Unlike organisms, salt stress-induced proteins L. lactis also subjected heat stress induction. DnaK, GroEL, GroES showed similar temporal patterns induction salt stress, resembling timing heat stress although lower induction level. data indicate overlap heat shock salt stress responses L. lactis.
