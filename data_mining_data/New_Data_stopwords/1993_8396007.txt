 Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration, 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase2) activity, messenger RNA decreased maternal rat liver last days gestation, recovery started delivery. Phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase activity messenger RNA increased contrast PFK-2 changes. Measurement glycolytic capacity isolated hepatocytes prepared rats 1 h parturition showed low glucose consumption impaired capacity metabolize glucose. results stress relevance PFK-2/fructose 2,6-bisphosphate system control glycolytic flux liver, changes intended prevent glucose consumption maternal liver contribute allow gluconeogenesis proceed end gestation. physiological basis adaptation may lay diversion glucose maternal fetal metabolism.
