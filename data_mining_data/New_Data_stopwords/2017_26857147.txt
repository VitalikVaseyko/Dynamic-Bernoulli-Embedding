 Metabolism alteration one hallmarks cancer cells. Although several studies demonstrated glycolysis played important roles progression nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), functions specific metabolism-associated genes remain largely unknown. study, found Pyruvate dehydrogenase B (PDHB), catalyzed conversion pyruvate Acetyl-CoA, downregulated NPC cells. Forced expression PDHB NPC cells inhibited cell growth migration, knocking expression PDHB promoted growth, migration, tumorigenesis NPC cells. Mechanism study showed PDHB inhibited ERK signaling cell growth driven RasV12. Collectively, study demonstrated suppressive roles PDHB progression NPC, restoring function PDHB might promising strategy NPC therapy.
