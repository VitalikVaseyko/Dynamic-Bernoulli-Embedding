 test hypothesis physical inactivity impairs exercise-induced modulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), six healthy normally physically active male subjects completed 7 days bed rest. immediately bed rest, subjects completed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) one-legged knee extensor exercise bout [45 min 60% maximal load (W(max))] muscle biopsies obtained vastus lateralis before, immediately exercise, 3 h recovery. Blood samples taken femoral vein artery 40 min exercise. Glucose intake elicited larger (P </= 0.05) insulin response bed rest before, indicating glucose intolerance. differences lactate release/uptake across exercising muscle bed rest, glucose uptake 40 min exercise larger (P </= 0.05) bed rest after. Muscle glycogen content tended higher (0.05< P </= 0.10) bed rest before, muscle glycogen breakdown response exercise similar bed rest. PDH-E1alpha protein content change response bed rest response exercise intervention. Exercise increased (P </= 0.05) activity PDH active form (PDHa) induced (P </= 0.05) dephosphorylation PDH-E1alpha Ser(2)(9)(3), Ser(2)(9)(5) Ser(3)(0)(0), difference bed rest. conclusion, although 7 days bed rest induced whole body glucose intolerance, exercise-induced PDH regulation skeletal muscle changed. suggests exercise-induced PDH regulation skeletal muscle maintained glucose-intolerant (e.g., insulin resistant) individuals.
