 steady-state kinetics human skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase (MA) RNA-complex (MB) examined compared. Kinetic studies revealed significant differences kinetic properties respect free complex form pyruvate kinase. form follows simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics contrast MB form, displays negative cooperativity respect ADP. Vmax complex 40-60% free enzyme. Heterologous RNA noncompetitive inhibitor free enzyme kinetics complex (MB) affected. presence 1.0 mM ATP assay mixture kinetic constants complex unchanged except Vmax, increased nearly 60%. Aged preparations free enzyme (MA) activated 100% more, native enzyme inhibited 22%. Inorganic phosphate potent activator forms pyruvate kinase. presence 50 mM K-phosphate apparent Michaelis constant interaction coefficient unchanged, Vmax free enzyme increases 35% complex 70%, respectively. specific activity aged form restored original value incubation enzyme 50 mM K-phosphate, pH 7.6, addition ATP (1.0 mM) assay mixture.
