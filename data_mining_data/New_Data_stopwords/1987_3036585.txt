 Pyruvate kinase one enzymes phosphorylated stimulation cell either glucagon Ca2+-linked hormones. Whether two classes hormones phosphorylate site enzyme unclear. results demonstrate isolation [32P]phosphorylated type-L pyruvate kinase glucagon-treated hepatocytes followed aspartyl-prolyl cleavage yields [32P]phosphorylated peptide Mr 17,000. fragment also phosphorylated response Ca2+-mediated agonist phenylephrine.
