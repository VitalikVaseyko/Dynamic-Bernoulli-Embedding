 BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Erlotinib selective inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, used treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). study evaluate efficacy erlotinib advanced NSCLC, observe adverse events. METHODS: open labeled, expanded access program (EAP) conducted 44 pathologically confirmed advanced NSCLC patients received least one regimen. Erlotinib (150 mg) orally administered daily till disease progression intolerable adverse events developed. efficacy evaluated according RECIS criteria; adverse events evaluated according NCI criteria. RESULTS: 44 patients, objective response rate 27.3%, disease control rate 65.9%u median progression-free survival time 4.5 months (0.9-8.1 months), median survival time 13.7 months (9.2-18.2 months). Adverse events generally mild (grade II), including skin rash (81.8%) diarrhea (56.8%). One (2.3%) patient developed grade III elevation serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). grade IV drug-related adverse event occurred. CONCLUSION: Erlotinib effective safe locally advanced metastatic NSCLC patients failed previous chemotherapy.
