 Cancer cells distinctive energy metabolism pathways support rapid cell division. preference anaerobic glycolysis normal oxygen condition known Warburg effect observed head neck cancers. metabolic changes controlled cancer-related transcription factors, tumor suppressor gene hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha. addition, various metabolic enzymes also actively regulate cancer-specific metabolism including switch aerobic anaerobic glycolysis. long time, metabolic changes cancer cells considered consequence transformation required maintain high rate tumor cell replication. However, recent studies indicate alteration metabolism sufficient initiate tumor transformation. Indeed, oncogenic mutations metabolic enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase, increasingly found various cancers, including head neck cancers. present review, introduce recent findings regarding cancer metabolism, including molecular mechanisms affect cancer pathogenesis maintenance. also discuss current future perspectives therapeutics target metabolic pathways, emphasis head neck cancer.
