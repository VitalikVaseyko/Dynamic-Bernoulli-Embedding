 Ingestion rate granulocytes osteomyelofibrosis splenomegaly, still matter controversy, measured 32 patients. mean ingestion rate patients' granulocytes similar controls; results, however, dispersed patients controls, high (three patients) low (three patients) ingestion rates. Ingestion alterations serum-independent. Neutrophil glycolytic enzymes adenylate-kinase measured order assess: (1) could responsible observed abnormalities (2) enzyme abnormalities, previously described red blood cells, also occur neutrophils. Major increases phosphofructoaldolase 3-phosphoglycerate kinase activities, contrasting decrease pyruvate kinase activity observed. These, however, correlate ingestion alterations. conclusion, showed granulocyte ingestion rate altered patients only, alterations unrelated serum, adenylate kinase glycolytic enzyme abnormalities. latter, however, important. mechanisms occurrence unknown hypotheses proposed red blood cells enzyme modifications myeloproliferative disorders could applicable.
