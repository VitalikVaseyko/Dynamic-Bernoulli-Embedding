 Metabolic rewiring established hallmark cancer, details rewiring systems level well characterized. acquire insight melanoma cell line panel tracking metabolic flux using isotopically labeled nutrients. Metabolic profiling flux balance analysis used compare normal melanocytes melanoma cell lines normoxic hypoxic conditions. melanoma cells exhibited Warburg phenomenon; used glucose produced lactate melanocytes. changes observed melanoma cells described Warburg phenomenon. Hypoxic conditions increased fermentation glucose lactate melanocytes melanoma cells (the Pasteur effect). However, metabolism strictly glycolytic, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle functional melanoma lines, even hypoxia. Furthermore, glutamine also key nutrient providing substantial anaplerotic contribution TCA cycle. WM35 melanoma line glutamine metabolized "reverse" (reductive) direction TCA cycle, particularly hypoxia. reverse flux allowed melanoma cells synthesize fatty acids glutamine glucose primarily converted lactate. Altogether, study, first comprehensive comparative analysis metabolism melanoma cells, provides foundation targeting metabolism therapeutic benefit melanoma.
