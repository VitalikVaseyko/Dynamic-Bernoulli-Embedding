 High-resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 14C fluorography used identify quantitate intermediates Embden-Meyerhof pathway intact cells cell extracts Streptococcus lactis. Glycolysing cells contained high levels fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (a positive effector pyruvate kinase) comparatively low concentrations glycolytic metabolites. contrast, starved organisms contained high levels 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate. concentration Pi (a negative effector pyruvate kinase) starved cells fourfold greater maintained glycolysing cells. following result suggest retention phosphoenolpyruvate pool starved cells consequence Pi-mediated inhibition pyruvate kinase: increase phosphoenolpyruvate pool (and Pi) preceded depletion fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, reduction intracellular Pi (by maltose-plus-arginine phosphate trap) caused restoration pyruvate kinase activity starved cells. Time course studies showed Pi conserved formation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate glycolysis. Conversely, starvation high levels Pi generated concomitant depletion intracellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. concentrations Pi fructose 1,6-bisphosphate present starved glycolysing cells S. lactis varied inversely. activity pyruvate kinase growing cell may modulated relative concentrations two antagonistic effectors.
