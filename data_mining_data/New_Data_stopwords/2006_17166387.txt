 BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Gefitinib selective inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, used treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). study evaluate efficacy Gefitinib advanced NSCLC, observe adverse events. METHODS: open labeled, expanded access program (EAP) conducted. Pathologically confirmed advanced NSCLC patients progressed systemic chemotherapy suitable systemic chemotherapy eligible program. Gefitinib (250 mg) orally administered daily till disease progression intolerable adverse events developed. RESULTS: Sep. 2002 Mar. 2005, 120 patients enrolled, 103 assessable response. objective response rate 18.4% (19/103). disease control rate 51.5% (53/103). median survival time 6 months (0.5-33 months). Adverse events generally mild (grade II), including skin rash (30.1%), dry skin (12.6%), diarrhea (25.2%). Two (1.9%) patients developed grade III elevation serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). grade IV adverse event occurred. CONCLUSION: Gefitinib effective treating advanced NSCLC, adverse events mild.
