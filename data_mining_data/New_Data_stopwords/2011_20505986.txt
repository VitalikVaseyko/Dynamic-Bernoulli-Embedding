 Since chronic stress used widely studying clinical depression brain energy metabolism oxidative stress might involved pathophysiology illness, objective study investigate activities pyruvate kinase, complex II IV (cytocrome c oxidase) hippocampus prefrontal cortex rats submitted chronic variable stress. also evaluated vitamins E C administration could prevent effects. 40 days adult rats stressed group subjected one stressor per day, different time day, order minimize predictability. stressed group gained less weight immobilization time forced swimming test greater control group. Results showed stressed group presented inhibition activities complex II cytochrome c oxidase prefrontal cortex, hippocampus complex IV inhibited. Pyruvate kinase activity altered stressed group compared control. Vitamins E C administration prevented alterations respiratory chain caused stress. data suggest impairment energy metabolism oxidative stress could related pathogenic pathways stress related disorders.
