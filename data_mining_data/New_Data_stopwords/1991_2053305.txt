 Nuclear magnetic resonance method contributes nowadays investigations phosphate metabolism red blood cells. means 31P nuclear magnetic resonance possible record intact red cells signals phosphate compounds well changes concentrations. submitted work authors followed important phosphate compounds red cells--adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate inorganic phosphate. assessed evaluated statistical methods spectra 10 healthy blood donors different age sex. procedure used 6 patients hereditary spherocytosis, 6 patients G-6-PD deficiency 4 patients pyruvate kinase deficiency. important changes recorded latter pathological entity, results consistent obtained methods.
