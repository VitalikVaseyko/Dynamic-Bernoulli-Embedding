 BACKGROUND: Symptoms obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) described neuropsychiatric syndromes associated streptococcal infections. proposed antibodies raised streptococcal proteins cross-react neuronal proteins (antigens) brain, particularly basal ganglia, brain region implicated OCD pathogenesis. AIMS: test hypothesis post-streptococcal autoimmunity, directed neuronal antigens, may contribute pathogenesis OCD adults. METHOD: Ninety-six participants OCD tested presence anti-streptolysin-O titres (ASOT) presence anti-basal ganglia antibodies (ABGA) cross-sectional study. ABGA tested western blots using three recombinant antigens; aldolase C, enolase pyruvate kinase. findings compared control group individuals depression (n = 33) schizophrenia (n = 17). RESULTS: Positivity ABGA observed 19/96 (19.8%) participants OCD compared 2/50 (4%) controls (Fisher's exact test P = 0.012). majority positive OCD sera (13/19) antibodies enolase antigen. clinical variables associated ABGA positivity. Positivity ASOT associated ABGA positivity found increased incidence participants OCD compared controls. CONCLUSIONS: findings support hypothesis central nervous system autoimmunity may aetiological role adults OCD. study required examine whether antibodies concerned pathogenic whether exposure streptococcal infection vulnerable individuals risk factor development OCD.
