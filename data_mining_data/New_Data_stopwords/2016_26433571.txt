 BACKGROUND: Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) exhibits suppressed mitochondrial function preferential use glycolysis even normoxia, promoting proliferation suppressing apoptosis. ccRCC resistance therapy driven constitutive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) expression due genetic loss von Hippel-Lindau factor. addition promoting angiogenesis, HIF suppresses mitochondrial function inducing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), gatekeeping enzyme mitochondrial glucose oxidation. OBJECTIVE: reverse mitochondrial suppression ccRCC using PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Radical nephrectomy specimens patients ccRCC assessed PDK expression. 786-O ccRCC line two animal models (chicken ovo murine xenografts) used mechanistic studies. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mitochondrial function, proliferation, apoptosis, HIF transcriptional activity, angiogenesis, tumor size measured vitro vivo. Independent-sample t-tests analysis variance used statistical analyses. RESULTS: PDK elevated 786-O cells ccRCC compared normal kidney tissue patient. DCA reactivated mitochondrial function (increased respiration, Krebs cycle metabolites alpha-ketoglutarate [cofactor factor inhibiting HIF], mitochondrial reactive oxygen species), increased p53 activity apoptosis, decreased proliferation 786-O cells. DCA reduced HIF transcriptional activity FIH-dependent manner, inhibiting angiogenesis vitro. DCA reduced tumor size angiogenesis vivo animal models. CONCLUSIONS: DCA reverse mitochondrial suppression ccRCC decrease HIF transcriptional activity, bypassing constitutive expression. previous clinical use humans makes attractive candidate translation ccRCC patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: show energy-boosting drug decreases tumor growth tumor blood vessels animals carrying human kidney cancer cells. generic drug used patients conditions thus could tested kidney cancer remains incurable.
