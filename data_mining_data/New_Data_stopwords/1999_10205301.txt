 dependence pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity [Ca2+] determined Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells different pyruvate concentrations. resulting family curves following characteristics: a) bell-shaped appearance curves maximum activity 600 nM Ca2+; b) unchanged position maxima changes pyruvate concentration; c) nonmonotonous changes PDC activity increasing pyruvate concentration fixed [Ca2+]. Feasible mechanisms involving Ca2+-dependent phosphatase kinase consistent experimental findings discussed. determine steps chain PDC reactions determine observed phenomena, mathematical model suggested based known data structural--functional relationships complex components--pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoyl acetyl transferase (E2), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3), protein X, kinase, phosphatase. adequately describe non-trivial dependence PDC activity [Ca2+] different pyruvate concentrations, also necessary consider interdependence steps general chain PDC reactions. Phenomenon (a) shown due involvement protein X PDC reactions, phenomenon (b) due changes activity kinase, phenomenon (c) due dependence acetylation transacetylation rates pyruvate concentration.
