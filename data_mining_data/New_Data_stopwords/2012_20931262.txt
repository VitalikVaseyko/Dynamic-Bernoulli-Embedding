 Altered metabolism cancer first highlighted Otto Warburg long history. Although ignored considerable amount time, receiving substantial attention. recently published results obtained combination two drugs, lipoic acid hydroxycitrate, targeting metabolic enzymes particularly affected cancer: ATP citrate lyase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. treatment efficient chemotherapy three mouse cancer models tested. work, asked drug combination could used conjunction standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, particular cisplatin, improve basic protocol efficacy. combination lipoic acid hydroxycitrate administered mice implanted syngeneic cancer cells, LL/2 lung carcinoma MBT-2 bladder carcinoma, concommitantly classical chemotherapy (cisplatin methotrexate). demonstrate triple combination lipoic acid + hydroxycitrate + cisplatin methotrexate efficient cisplatin methotrexate used individually combination lipoic acid hydroxycitrate administered alone. particular note results obtained treatment 80 year-old female presented ductal adenocarcinoma pancreas accompanied liver metastases. treatment course using gemcitabine plus alpha-lipoic acid hydroxycitrate gave highly promising results. vivo data, coupled case study results, suggest possible advantage using treatment targeted cancer metabolism association classical chemotherapy.
