 1. Maximal activities key enzymes glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle glutaminolysis measured homogenates variety normal, neoplastic suppressed cells. 2. relative activities hexokinase 6-phosphofructokinase suggest that, particularly neoplastic cells, capacity glucose transport high, hexokinase could approach saturation respect intracellular glucose; consequently, hexokinase phosphofructokinase could play important role regulation glycolytic flux cells. 3. activity pyruvate kinase considerably higher tumorigenic cells non-tumorigenic cells higher metastatic cells tumorigenic cells: non-tumorigenic cells activities range 28.4 574, tumorigenic cells 899 1280, metastatic cells 1590 1627 nmol/min per mg protein. 4. ratio pyruvate kinase activity 2 x phosphofructokinase activity high neoplastic cells. mean 22.4 neoplastic cells, whereas muscle 60 different animals 3.8. 5. citrate synthase isocitrate dehydrogenase activities present non-neoplastic neoplastic cells, suggesting full complement tricarboxylic-acid-cycle enzymes present latter cells. 6. neoplastic cells, activity glutaminase similar greater hexokinase, suggests glutamine may important glucose energy generation cells.
