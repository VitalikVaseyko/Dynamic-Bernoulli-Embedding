 epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process allows trans-differentiation cell epithelial features cell mesenchymal characteristics. process reported key priming event tumor development therefore EMT activation considered established trait malignancy. transcriptional epigenetic reprogramming governs EMT extensively characterized reviewed last decade. However, increasing evidence demonstrates correlation metabolic reprogramming EMT execution. aim current review gather recent findings illustrate correlation help deciphering whether metabolic changes causative bystander effect EMT activation. review divided accordingly catabolic anabolic pathways characterize carbohydrate, aminoacid, lipid metabolism. Moreover, end part, discussed series potential metabolic targets involved EMT promotion execution drugs either available could investigated therapeutic intervention.
