 Pea3 transcription factor (which belongs PEA3 group) Ets family shown involved mammary embryogenesis oncogenesis. However, except proteinases, target genes reported. present report, identified bax Pea3 up-regulated gene. provide evidence regulation using Pea3 overexpression Pea3 silencing mammary cell line. Pea3 Erm, another member PEA3 group, able transactivate bax promoter fragments. Although minimal Pea3-regulated bax promoter contain Ets-binding site, two functional upstream stimulatory factor-regulated E boxes present. demonstrate ability Pea3 USF-1 cooperate transactivation bax promoter, mutation E boxes dramatically reducing Pea3 transactivation potential. Although Pea3 directly bind minimal bax promoter, provide evidence USF-1 could form ternary complex Pea3 DNA. Taken together, results suggest Pea3 may regulate bax transcription via interaction USF-1 without binding DNA.
