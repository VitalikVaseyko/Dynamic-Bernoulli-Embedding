 BACKGROUND: Monocytes primed vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release cytokines, enhanced killing cancer cells, enhanced release microbicidal oxygen radicals like superoxide peroxide. investigated proteins involved regulating priming, using 2D gel proteomics. RESULTS: Monocytes 4 normal donors cultured 16 h chemically defined medium Teflon bags +/- LPS +/- 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), serine protease inhibitor. LPS-primed monocytes released inflammatory cytokines, produced increased amounts superoxide. AEBSF blocked priming enhanced superoxide, affect cytokine release, showing AEBSF toxic. staining large-format 2D gels Sypro ruby, compared monocyte proteome four conditions donor. found 30 protein spots differed significantly response LPS AEBSF, proteins identified ion trap mass spectrometry. CONCLUSION: identified 19 separate proteins changed response LPS AEBSF, including ATP synthase, coagulation factor XIII, ferritin, coronin, HN ribonuclear proteins, integrin alpha IIb, pyruvate kinase, ras suppressor protein, superoxide dismutase, transketolase, tropomyosin, vimentin, others. Interestingly, response LPS, precursor proteins interleukin-1beta appeared; response AEBSF, increase elastase inhibitor. increase elastase inhibitor provides support hypothesis priming requires endogenous serine protease.
