 Combined effects vincristine quercetin regulation isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac necrosis evaluated rats. ISO administration (100 mg/kg, s.c., two consecutive days) increased levels serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) cardiac troponin (cTnT) well cardiac lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde lipid hydroperoxides). However, reduced activities superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase glutathione peroxidase level reduced glutathione. also increased heart rate ST-segment elevation ECG. Pretreatment vincristine (25 mug/kg) quercetin (10 mg/kg) alone 2 weeks ameliorated cardiotoxic effects partially. However, treatment vincristine quercetin similar period reduced serum CK-MB, LDH, SGPT cTnT levels near normal levels ISO-treated rats. Concomitantly, test drugs improved status antioxidants decreased cardiac lipid peroxidation products. Combined treatment drugs also restored pathological electrocardiographic patterns reduced area myocardial necrosis. Histopathology heart ISO-administered rats received vincristine quercetin showed nearly normal myocardium little inflammatory infiltration. conclusion, present finding appears first one, suggesting better protection cardiac tissues combined treatment vincristine quercetin isoproterenol-induced cardiac toxicity.
