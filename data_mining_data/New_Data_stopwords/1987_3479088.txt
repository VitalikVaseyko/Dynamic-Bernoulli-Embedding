 Rats injected daily isoproterenol (2 mg/kg body wt) five days, incisor teeth amputated every day five amputations. animals subdivided two subgroups killed 12 24 h first last intervention. 12 h enzymes except hexokinase (HK) pyruvate kinase (PFK) showed decreased activities isoproterenol. incisor amputation, increased HK PFK activities observed. procedures, activation beta-adrenergic receptors results show different biochemical events take place, suggesting different mechanisms.
