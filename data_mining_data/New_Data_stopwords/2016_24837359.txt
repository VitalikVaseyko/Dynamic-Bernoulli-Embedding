 S-Adenosylmethionine converted enzymatically non-enzymatically methylthioadenosine, recycled methionine (Met) via salvage pathway. plants bacteria, enzymes steps pathway known except last: transamination alpha-ketomethylthiobutyrate give Met. mammals, glutamine transaminase K (GTK) omega-amidase (omega-Am) thought act tandem execute step, GTK forming alpha-ketoglutaramate, omega-Am hydrolyzes. Comparative genomics indicated GTK omega-Am could function likewise plants bacteria genes encoding GTK omega-Am homologs (i) co-express Met salvage gene 5-methylthioribose kinase Arabidopsis, (ii) cluster chromosome Met salvage genes diverse bacteria. Consistent possibility, tomato, maize, Bacillus subtilis GTK omega-Am homologs predicted activities: GTK specific glutamine amino donor strongly preferred alpha-ketomethylthiobutyrate amino acceptor, omega-Am strongly preferred alpha-ketoglutaramate. Also consistent possibility, plant GTK omega-Am localized cytosol, Met salvage pathway resides, well organelles. multiple targeting shown result use alternative start codons. B. subtilis, ablating GTK omega-Am modest significant inhibitory effect growth 5-methylthioribose sole sulfur source. Collectively, data indicate GTK, coupled omega-Am, positioned support significant Met salvage flux plants bacteria, probably replaced aminotransferases.
