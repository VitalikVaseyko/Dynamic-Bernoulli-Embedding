 BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus sakei valuable fermentation meat products exhibits properties allow better preservation meat fish. substrates, glucose ribose main carbon sources available growth. used whole-genome microarray based genome sequence L. sakei strain 23K investigate global transcriptome response three L. sakei strains grown ribose compared glucose. RESULTS: function common regulated genes mostly related carbohydrate metabolism transport. Decreased transcription genes encoding enzymes involved glucose metabolism L-lactate dehydrogenase observed, genes showing differential expression up-regulated. Especially transcription genes directly involved ribose catabolism, phosphoketolase pathway, alternative fates pyruvate increased. Interestingly, methylglyoxal synthase gene, encodes enzyme unique L. sakei among lactobacilli, up-regulated. Ribose catabolism seems closely linked catabolism nucleosides. deoxyribonucleoside synthesis operon transcriptional regulator gene strongly up-regulated, well two gene clusters involved nucleoside catabolism. One clusters included ribokinase gene. Moreover, hprK encoding HPr kinase/phosphatase, plays major role regulation carbon metabolism sugar transport, up-regulated, genes encoding general PTS enzyme mannose-specific enzyme II complex (EIIman). Putative catabolite-responsive element (cre) sites found proximity promoter several genes operons affected change carbon source. could indicate regulation catabolite control protein (CcpA)-mediated carbon catabolite repression (CCR) mechanism, possibly EIIman indirectly involved. CONCLUSIONS: data shows ribose uptake catabolic machinery L. sakei highly regulated transcription level. global regulation mechanism seems permit fine tuning expression enzymes control efficient exploitation available carbon sources.
