 frozen storage 7 d, viability CO2 productivity conventional baker's yeast strain greatly decreased. viability freeze-tolerant strain, DFT, used frozen dough method slightly decreased storage period, CO2 productivity greatly decreased. CO2 productivity DNase inhibitory activity actin cell-free extracts prepared immediately thawing 7-d frozen-stored cells markedly decreased strains. DFT, however, productivity inhibitory activity cell-free extract increased extract prepared incubation frozen-thawed cells 30 degrees C. increase inhibitory activity first occurred increase CO2 productivity. Gel filtration patterns actin glycolytic enzymes compared cell-free extracts strains. Peaks actin activity peaks hexokinase pyruvate kinase decreased strain frozen storage, slightly strain DFT. frozen storage, phosphofructokinase activity peak shifted lower molecular weight strain D.
