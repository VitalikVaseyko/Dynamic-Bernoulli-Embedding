 identify specific proteins associated chemotherapeutic responses, analyzed protein expression patterns stage IIIc primary serous epithelial ovarian cancer tissues displaying differential responses first-line postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. expression profiles five chemoresistant tissues [progression-free survival (PFS) </=12 months] five chemosensitive tissues (PFS >/=48 months) analyzed 2D electrophoresis, spot intensities differentially expressed proteins quantified. validate proteins markers chemoresistant disease, analyzed tissues additional 17 patients. patients allocated over- underexpressing group according protein spot intensity, survival analysis performed. chemoresistant tissues, four proteins (thioredoxin domain containing four, similar RIKEN cDNA 1700016G05, tubulin alpha 1A chain, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-beta subunit precursor) overexpressed, seven proteins [keratin 1, vitamin D-binding protein, creatine kinase B, annexin V, SH3-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SGEF), tryptophan-aspartate repeat protein-1 (WDR 1), WDR 1 isoform 1] underexpressed. underexpression keratin 1, creatine kinase B, annexin V, SGEF, WDR1, WDR1 isoform 1 significantly correlated poor overall survival. combination keratin 1 SGEF showed highest sensitivity 0.800, specificity 0.917, PPV 0.800, NPV 0.917 predicting chemoresistant disease. proteins may useful predictive markers chemoresistant disease. However, analyses large-scale performed considered reliable predictive markers chemoresistant disease.
