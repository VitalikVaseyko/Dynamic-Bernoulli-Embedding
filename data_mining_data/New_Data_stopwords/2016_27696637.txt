 metabolism tumor cells shifts oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis even aerobic environment. phenomenon known Warburg effect. effect regulated mainly polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), splicer mRNA rate-limiting enzymes glycolysis, pyruvate kinase muscle 1 2 (PKM1 PKM2). present study, demonstrated miR-133b reduced PTBP1 expression translational level expression levels miR-133b significantly downregulated gastric cancer clinical samples human cell lines, whereas protein expression level PTBP1 upregulated 80% 20 clinical samples gastric cancer examined. Ectopic expression miR-133b knockdown PTBP1 gastric cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation induction autophagy switching PKM isoform expression PKM2-dominant PKM1-dominant. growth inhibition partially canceled autophagy inhibitor 3-MA reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine. findings indicated miR-133b acted tumor-suppressor negative regulation Warburg effect gastric cancer cells.
