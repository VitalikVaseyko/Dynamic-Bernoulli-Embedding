 Ca2+/CaM-dependent multifunctional protein kinase isoenzymes brain, skeletal muscle liver compared phosphorylation number protein substrates. conditions assay, three isoenzymes demonstrated rapid phosphorylation synapsin glycogen synthase. contrast, rates phosphorylation pyruvate kinase phenylalanine hydroxylase almost two orders magnitude slower. Differences phosphorylation specifically latter two substrates also observed among three protein kinases. Phosphorylation Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases contrasted cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylates proteins vitro vivo. potential role Ca2+/CaM-dependent multifunctional protein kinases Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation substrates discussed.
