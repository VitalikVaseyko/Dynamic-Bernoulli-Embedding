 Metabolism important differentiating feature cancer cells. Lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) A/B metabolically important proteins involved critical step inter-conversion lactate pyruvate. Panepoxydone (PP), natural NF-kB inhibitor, significantly reduces oxygen consumption lactate production MCF-7 triple negative (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 MDA-MB-453) breast cancer cells. observed PP inhibited mitochondrial membrane potential ATP synthesis using flow cytometry. PP also up-regulated LDH-B down-regulated LDH-A expression levels breast cancer cells similar levels observed HMEC cells. Over-expression LDH-B cancer cell lines leads enhanced apoptosis, mitochondrial damage, reduced cell migration. Analyzing patient data set GDS4069 available GEO website, observed 100% non TNBC 60% TNBC patients less LDH-B expression LDH-A expression levels. Herein report new term called Glycolytic index, novel method calculate utilization oxidative phosphorylation breast cancer cells measuring ratio LDH-B LDH-A. Furthermore, inhibitors NF-kB could serve therapeutic agent targeting metabolism treatment triple negative breast cancer.
