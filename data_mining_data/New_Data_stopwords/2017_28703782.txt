 mortality morbidity characterize bladder cancer compel malignancy category hot topics terms biomolecular research. Therefore, better knowledge specific molecular mechanisms underlie development progression bladder cancer demanded. Tumor heterogeneity among patients similar diagnosis, well intratumor heterogeneity, generates difficulties terms targeted therapy. Furthermore, late diagnosis represents ongoing issue, significantly reducing response therapy and, inevitably, overall survival. role non-coding RNAs bladder cancer emerged last decade, revealing microRNAs (miRNAs) may act tumor suppressor genes, respectively oncogenes, also biomarkers early diagnosis. Regarding types non-coding RNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) extensively reviewed article, exact roles tumorigenesis are-for time being-not evident case miRNAs, but, still, clearly suggested. Therefore, review covers non-coding RNA expression profile bladder cancer patients validated target genes bladder cancer cell lines, repercussions processes proliferation, invasiveness, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, molecular pathways specific malignant transformation cells.
