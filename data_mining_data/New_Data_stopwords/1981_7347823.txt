 present work considered following erythrocyte enzymatic activities; hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase (6PGD), glicero phosphate-isomerase (PHI) glutathione-reductase (GR) red blood cells 130 subjects 55 healthy non cancerous pathology 75 malignant tumors. Evident modification shown HK together fructose-6-phosphate-kinase (PFK) PK limiting steps glycolysis. increased HK activity value resulted particularly significant red blood cells patients affected well differentiated adenocarcinoma.
