 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) correlated fasting hyperglycaemia. However, underlying mechanism remains unclear. excessive hepatic gluconeogenesis major cause fasting hyperglycaemia present study investigated whether FSH increases hepatic gluconeogenesis mice. METHODS: Ovariectomised mice supplemented oestradiol (E2) maintain normal levels serum E2 (OVX+E2 mice) injected low high doses FSH. knocked Crtc2, crucial factor gluconeogenesis, Fshr discern involvement FSH signalling. evaluate role G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK2), could affect glucose metabolism interact directly non-GPCR components, specific GRK2 inhibitor used. pyruvate tolerance test (PTT), quantification PEPCK glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), key enzymes gluconeogenesis, GRK2 phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) examined evaluate level gluconeogenesis liver. nonphosphorylatable mutant AMPK Ser485 (AMPK S485A) transfected HepG2 cells evaluate role AMPK Ser485 phosphorylation. RESULTS: FSH increased fasting glucose (OVX+E2+high-dose FSH 8.18 +/- 0.60 mmol/l vs OVX+E2 6.23 +/- 1.33 mmol/l), PTT results, transcription Pepck (also known Pck1; 2.0-fold increase) G6pase (also known G6pc; 2.5-fold increase) OVX+E2 mice. FSH also enhanced promoter luciferase activities two enzymes HepG2 cells. FSH promoted membrane translocation GRK2, associated increased AMPK Ser485 decreased AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation, enhanced nuclear translocation cyclic AMP-regulated transcriptional coactivator 2 (CRTC2). GRK2 could bind AMPK induce Ser485 hyperphosphorylation. Furthermore, either GRK2 inhibitor AMPK S485A blocked FSH-regulated AMPK Thr172 dephosphorylation gluconeogenesis. Additionally, deletion Crtc2 Fshr abolished function FSH OVX+E2 mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: results indicate FSH enhances CRTC2-mediated gluconeogenesis dependent AMPK Ser485 phosphorylation via GRK2 liver, suggesting essential role FSH pathogenesis fasting hyperglycaemia.
