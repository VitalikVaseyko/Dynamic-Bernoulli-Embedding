 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase consists catalytic subunit (Kc) basic subunit (Kb) appear anchored dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core component (E2) another subunit, referred protein X (Rahmatullah, M., Jilka, J. M., Radke, G. A., Roche, T. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6515-6523). determined catalytic requirements reduction acetylation lipoyl moiety protein X linked changes protein X regulatory effects kinase activity. Using fractions prepared resolution proteolytic treatments, evaluated subunits required regulatory effects kinase activity. X-KcKb fraction (treated remove mercurial agent used preparation), found resolved pyruvate dehydrogenase component, isolated inner domain E2 (lacking lipoyl-bearing region E2), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase component directly utilize protein X substrate. resulting reduction acetylation protein X occurs association enhancement kinase activity. Following tryptic cleavage E2 protein X subdomains, full acetylation lipoyl-bearing subdomains proteins retained along capacity acetylating substrates stimulate kinase activity. kinase-containing fractions, including Kb subunit digested, inhibited pyruvate ADP, alone, synergistically combination suggesting pyruvate ADP bind Kc. results suggest Kb subunit kinase contribute observed regulatory effects. dynamic role protein X attenuating kinase activity based changes mitochondrial redox acetylating potentials considered.
