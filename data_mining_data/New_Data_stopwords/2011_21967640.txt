 Eukaryotic mitochondria resulted symbiotic incorporation alpha-proteobacteria ancient archaea species. evolution, mitochondria lost prokaryotic bacterial genes conserved small fraction including encoding 13 proteins respiratory chain. process, many functions transferred host cells, mitochondria gained central role regulation cell proliferation apoptosis, modulation metabolism; accordingly, defective organelles contribute cell transformation cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases. cell transcriptional effects mitochondria depend modulation respiratory rate production hydrogen peroxide released cytosol. mitochondrial oxidative rate remain depressed cell proliferation; even presence O(2), energy preferentially obtained increased glycolysis (Warburg effect). response stress signals, traffic pro- antiapoptotic mitochondrial proteins intermembrane space (B-cell lymphoma-extra large, Bcl-2-associated death promoter, Bcl-2 associated X-protein cytochrome c) modulated redox condition determined mitochondrial O(2) utilization mitochondrial nitric oxide metabolism. article, highlight traffic different canonical signaling pathways mitochondria contributions organelles redox regulation kinases. Finally, analyze dynamics mitochondrial population cell cycle apoptosis.
