 dauer larva, non-feeding developmentally arrested stage free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, morphologically physiologically specialized survival dispersal adverse growth conditions. ability dauer larvae live several times longer continuous developmental life span attributed part repressed metabolism. used serial analysis gene expression (SAGE) profiles dauer larvae mixed growing stages compare expression patterns genes known predicted roles glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogen metabolism, Krebs glyoxylate cycles, selected fermentation pathways. Ratios mixed:dauer transcripts indicated non-dauer enrichment consistent previously determined adult:dauer enzyme activity ratios hexokinase (glycolysis), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (gluconeogenesis), isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-dependent), isocitrate lyase-malate synthase (glyoxylate cycle). Transcripts majority Krebs cycle components differentially represented two profiles. Transcript abundance pyruvate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase, putative cytosolic fumarate reductase, two pyruvate dehydrogenase components, succinyl CoA synthetase alpha subunit implied anaerobic pathways upregulated dauer larvae. Generation nutritive fermentation byproducts moderation oxidative damage potential benefits hypoxic dauer interior.
