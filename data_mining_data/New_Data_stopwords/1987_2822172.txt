 addition oxalate blood stored Citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) produces marked improvement 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) preservation; increase 2,3-DPG levels also documented short-term incubation studies. Oxalate potent vitro inhibitor red cell lactate dehydrogenase, monophosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase (PK). presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate latter inhibitory effect competitive phospho(enol)pyruvate (PEP). Determination levels intermediate compounds red cells incubated oxalate suggest presence inhibition PK step, indicating site oxalate action. Apparent inhibition glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase step apparently due increase NADH/NAD ratio. Oxalate effect vivo viability rabbit red cells stored CPD preservatives 21 days. Greater understanding toxicity oxalate required considered suitable component preservative media, appreciation mechanism affects 2,3-DPG levels may important design blood additives. Malonate, 3-carbon dicarboxylic acid analogue oxalate late inhibit pyruvate kinase affect 2,3-DPG levels.
