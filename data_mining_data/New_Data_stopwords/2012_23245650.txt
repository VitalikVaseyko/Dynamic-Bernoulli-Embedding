 Tumor cells exhibit enhanced glucose consumption lactate production even supplied adequate oxygen (a phenomenon known Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis). Pharmacological inhibition aerobic glycolysis represents potential tumor-selective approach targets metabolic differences normal malignant tissues. Human breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells used develop assay system discover natural product-based glycolysis inhibitors. assay employed based hypersensitivity glycolytic inhibition tumor cells treated mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor rotenone. conditions, ATP supply, hence cell viability, depends exclusively glycolysis. assay system used evaluate 10648 plant marine organism extracts U.S. National Cancer Institute's Open Repository. Bioassay-guided isolation active Moronobea coccinea extract yielded new bis-geranylacylphloroglucinol derivative moronone (1). Compound 1 exhibited enhanced antiproliferative/cytotoxic activity presence rotenone-imposed metabolic stress tumor cells. Surprisingly, mechanistic studies revealed 1 inhibit glycolysis, rather functions protonophore dissipates mitochondrial proton gradient. presence rotenone, tumor cells may hypersensitive protonophores due increased ATP utilization ATP synthase.
