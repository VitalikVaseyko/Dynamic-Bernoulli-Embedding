 1. Tubule fragments isolated treatment rat kidney cortex collagenase. formation glucose lactate incubation 5mM-pyruvate measured various conditions. 2. tubule fragments isolated fed rats absence Ca2+ incubated various Ca2+ concentrations, incubation period 15--30 min necessary establish metabolic steady state. conditions glucose formation increased Ca2+, adrenaline 3':5'-cyclic AMP greater extent lactate formation. Data show appreciable lactate formation could resulted glycolytic metabolism glucose formed gluconeogenesis incubation. 3. tubule fragments isolated fed rats presence 1.27 mM-Ca2+ adjustments made Ca2+ concentration commencement incubation, metabolic steady state rapidly established. conditions lactate formation almost insensitive Ca2+ concentration (0.16--4.5 mM), whereas glucose formation varied Ca2+ concentration sigmoidal manner. 3':5'-Cyclic AMP decreased sigmoidicity. 4. Ca2+ depletion tissue incubation appeared change permanently relationship extracellular Ca2+ concentration measured rates metabolic processes. 5. conditions metabolic steady state, glucose formation tubule fragments fed rats less sensitive lactate formation inhibition 3-mercaptopicolinate 2-n-butylmalonate. Lactate formation tubule fragments prepared 48 h-starved rats sensitive inhibitors. 6. Estimates made rate futile cycling C3 species pyruvate kinase. greater starved fed state, decreased 3':5'-cyclic AMP fed starved state, unaffected Ca2+. 7. results suggested formation lactate glucose less tightly linked kidney cortex liver. considerable amount supply reducing equivalents lactate formation appear associated energy-dependent translocation mitochondria cytosol involving pyruvate leads oxaloacetate leads phosphoenolpyruvate leads pyruvate cycle.
