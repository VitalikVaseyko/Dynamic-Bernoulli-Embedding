 Experiments 54 dogs use manometric method Warburg proved level oxidative phosphorylation brain cortex segments differing level phylogenic development dissimilar. new cortex segment (sensomotor region) oxygen inorganic phosphorus uptake well degree conjugation, compared energy exchange intensity tissues old cortex (hippocampus), found show higher level. Anesthetics, ether sodium hexobarbital caused dissociation oxidative phosphorylation, pronounced elements old cortical segments new ones. suppression biochemical processes especially profound effect sodium hexobarbital less marked ether poisoning. Hypoxia combined action anesthetic hypoxia produced inhibition energy exchange, intensive new cortical segments.
