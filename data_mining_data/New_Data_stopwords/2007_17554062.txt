 addition physiologic role central regulator hematopoietic reproductive systems, Kit receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathologically overexpressed forms leukemia constitutively activated oncogenic mutations mast-cell proliferations gastrointestinal stromal tumors. gain insight general activation signaling mechanisms RTKs, investigated activation-dependent dynamic membrane distributions wild-type oncogenic forms Kit hematopoietic cells. Ligand-induced recruitment wild-type Kit lipid rafts stimulation Kit ligand (KL) constitutive localization oncogenic Kit lipid rafts necessary Kit-mediated proliferation survival signals. KL-dependent oncogenic Kit kinase activity resulted recruitment regulatory phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) subunit p85 rafts catalytical PI3-K subunit p110 constitutively resides. Cholesterol depletion methyl-beta-cyclodextrin prevented Kit-mediated activation PI3-K downstream target Akt inhibited cellular proliferation KL-activated oncogenic Kit, including mutants resistant Kit inhibitor imatinib-mesylate. data consistent notion Kit recruitment lipid rafts required efficient activation PI3-K/Akt pathway Kit-mediated proliferation.
