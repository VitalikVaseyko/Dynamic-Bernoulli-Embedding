 Thiamine one several essential cofactors ATP generation. deficiency, like beriberi Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, studied many decades. However, mechanism action still completely understood cellular molecular levels. Since acts coenzyme dehydrogenases pyruvate, branched-chain keto acids, ketoglutarate, nutritional privation partly phenocopy inborn errors metabolism, among maple syrup urine disease. present paper, report metabolic genomic findings mice deprived thiamine. similar ones previously found biotin deficiency, another ATP generation cofactor. show thiamine deficiency substantially reduced energy state liver activated energy sensor AMP-activated kinase. vitamin deficiency, several metabolic parameters changed: blood glucose diminished serum lactate increased, insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, well liver glycogen, reduced. results indicate severe change energy status whole organism. findings associated modified hepatic levels mRNAs several carbon metabolism genes: reduction transcripts liver glucokinase fatty acid synthase augmentation carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase markers glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, beta-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, respectively. Glucose tolerance initially increased, suggesting augmented insulin sensitivity, found biotin deficiency; however, case thiamine, diminished 3rd week on, deficient animals became undernourished, paralleled changes AKT mTOR, 2 main proteins insulin signaling pathway. Since many metabolic gene expression effects mice deprived thiamine similar biotin deficiency, may result general impairment oxidative phosphorylation due shortage ATP generation cofactors. findings may relevant energy-related disorders, among several inborn errors metabolism, well common energy disorders like obesity, diabetes, neurodegenerative illnesses.
