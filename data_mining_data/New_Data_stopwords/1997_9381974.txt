 Five mitochondrial protein kinases, members new family protein kinases, identified, cloned, expressed recombinant proteins, partially characterized respect catalytic regulatory properties. Four members unique family eukaryotic protein kinases correspond pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozymes regulate activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, important regulatory enzyme interface glycolysis citric acid cycle. fifth member family corresponds branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, enzyme responsible phosphorylation inactivation branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, important regulatory enzyme pathway disposal branched-chain amino acids. least three long-term control mechanisms evolved conserve branched chain amino acids protein synthesis periods dietary protein insufficiency. Increased expression branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase perhaps important leads phosphorylation nearly complete inactivation liver branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Decreased amounts liver branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex secondary decrease liver mitochondria also decrease liver's capacity branched-chain keto acid oxidation. Finally, number E1 subunits branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex reduced less full complement 12 heterotetramers per complex liver protein-starved rats. Since E1 component rate-limiting activity also component complex inhibited phosphorylation, decrease number limits overall enzyme activity makes complex sensitive regulation phosphorylation nutritional state. branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase phosphorylates serine 293 E1 alpha subunit branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Site-directed mutagenesis amino acid residues surrounding serine 293 reveals arginine 288, histidine 292 aspartate 296 critical dehydrogenase activity, histidine 292 critical binding coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate, serine 293 exists close proximity active site dehydrogenase. Alanine scanning mutagenesis residues immediate vicinity phosphorylation site (serine 293) indicates arginine 288 required recognition serine 293 phosphorylation site branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase. Phosphorylation appears inhibit dehydrogenase activity introducing negative charge directly active site pocket E1 dehydrogenase component branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. model based X-ray crystal structure transketolase used predict residues involved thiamine pyrophosphate binding help visualize phosphorylation within channel leading reactive carbon thiamine pyrophosphate inhibits catalytic activity. isoenzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase differ greatly terms specific activities, kinetic parameters regulatory properties. Chemically-induced diabetes rat induces significant changes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 2 liver. Preliminary findings suggest hormonal control activity state pyruvate dehydrogenase complex may involves tissue specific induced changes expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzymes.
