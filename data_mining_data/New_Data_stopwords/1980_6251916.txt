 Phenylephrine presence 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine propanolol caused 40-50% inhibition pyruvate kinase (type L) activity isolated hepatocytes, accompanied 2-3-fold increase phosphate content enzyme. changes blocked alpha-adrenergic antagonist dihydroergocryptine could accounted slight increase cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity generated alpha-adrenergic agonist. concluded significant component inhibition hepatic pyruvate kinase mediated alpha-adrenergic agonists attributed cyclic AMP-independent alteration phosphorylation state enzyme.
