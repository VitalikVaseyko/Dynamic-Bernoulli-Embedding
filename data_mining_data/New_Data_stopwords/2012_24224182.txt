 PURPOSE: cancers exhibit high levels aerobic glycolytic metabolism diminished levels mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation even presence normal near-normal levels oxygen ("Warburg effect"). However, technical challenges limited development non-invasive vivo imaging techniques monitoring glycolytic metabolism hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) quantitatively evaluating impact effect growth therapy disease. Thus, critical need develop non-invasive techniques longitudinal assessment metabolism treatment response patients unresectable HCCs. PROCEDURES: article discusses novel method, "Hyperpolarized (13)C MRS imaging", achieving objective thus improving prognosis HCC patients. primary objective characterize vivo metabolic biomarkers determinants HCC metabolism treatment response unresectable HCC tumors viable HCC cells. RESULTS: innovative technique capitalizes new technology increases sensitivity MRS detection crucial metabolites cancer cells. CONCLUSION: anticipated innovative approach lead improved methods, diagnosis staging HCCs facilitation development enzyme targeted therapies therapeutic interventions.
