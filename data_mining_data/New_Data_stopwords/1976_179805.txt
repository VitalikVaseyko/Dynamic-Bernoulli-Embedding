 Activities key carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes determined biopsied liver tissues obtained patients acute chronic viral hepatitis postnecrotic cirrhosis liver. results indicated activities fetal prototype enzymes, low-Km hexokinases, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase type M2 increased, adult type liver enzymes, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase pyruvate kinase type L decreased livers cases. Phosphofructokinase activity tended increase acute hepatitis. Principal component analysis revealed enzyme patterns acute hepatitis liver cirrhosis deviated control closely resembled hepatocellular carcinomas.
