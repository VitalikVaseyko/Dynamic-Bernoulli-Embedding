 effect dietary vitamin E activities pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase studied tissues rats. activity pyruvate kinase plasma 1-month-old male rats fed vitamin E-deficient diet 4 months increased 8.5-fold 45 ppm vitamin E-supplemented animals. Relative supplemented group, enzyme activity increased 23% (P less 0.001) red blood cells, unchanged liver lung, decreased 20% (P less 0.001) muscle vitamin E-deficient rats. activity lactate dehydrogenase significantly altered dietary vitamin E tissues measured. Similar results obtained 2-month-old rats fed respective diets 3 months. results suggest vitamine E deficiency rats may cause muscular damage release pyruvate kinase blood circulation.
