 BACKGROUND AIM: Adult patients cystic fibrosis (CF) increased risk gastrointestinal malignancies. hypothesized increased intestinal cell turnover beginning childhood may explain increased risk malignancy early adulthood. Therefore, aimed measure fecal M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), biomarker intestinal cell turnover, children CF. assess whether increased cell turnover secondary intestinal inflammation, secondary aims measure fecal calprotectin evaluate association fecal M2-PK. METHODS: Fecal samples, M2-PK calprotectin measurements, prospectively collected children CF healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: Thirty-three children CF (mean [standard deviation] 7.3 [3.8] years old; 29 pancreatic insufficient [PI]) enrolled compared 33 age-matched HC. Fecal M2-PK CF patients (median [interquartile range, IQR]: 4.7 [1.5-9.7]) greater HC (1.0 [1.0-1.0] U/mL; P < 0.0001), higher PI (median [IQR]: 5.1 [1.8-13.7]) pancreatic sufficient patients (1.0 [1.0-1.0] U/mL; P = 0.002). Fecal calprotectin significantly elevated CF HC (median [IQR] 61.3 [43.8-143.8] vs 19.5 [19.5-35.1] mg/kg; P < 0.0001). However, correlation fecal M2-PK fecal calprotectin levels among subjects CF (r = 0.29; P = 0.1). CONCLUSION: Increased intestinal cell turnover present children PI CF. lack relationship fecal M2-PK calprotectin suggests contributing factor(s) inflammation may present.
