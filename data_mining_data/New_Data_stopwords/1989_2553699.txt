 Protein import cell nucleus requires specific binding nuclear proteins nuclear pore complex. Based amino acid sequence "motifs" known nuclear targeting signals, identified peptides within number nuclear proteins likely nuclear targeting potential tested function transfecting cells fusion genes produce cytoplasmic "reporter" protein, pyruvate kinase (PK), joined test sequence. Sequences within c-myb (PLLKKIKQ), N-myc (PPQKKIKS), p53 (PQPKKKP), c-erb-A (SKRVAKRKL) oncoproteins direct PK hybrids nucleus identified. peptide (GRKKRRQRRRAP) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tat protein (Tat), contains two short basic regions, targets fusion proteins nucleolus. COOH-terminal basic Tat region (QRRRAP) target PK hybrid proteins nucleus, mutation two basic amino acids region decreases abolish nucleolar accumulation mediated entire Tat nucleolar targeting sequence. Moreover, c-Myc nuclear targeting sequence fused COOH-terminal basic Tat region (PAAKRVKLDQRRRAP) effectively localizes PK hybrids nucleus nucleolus. similar sequence (FKRKHKKDISQNKRAVRR) human heat-shock protein HSP70 also localizes PK nucleus nucleolus.
