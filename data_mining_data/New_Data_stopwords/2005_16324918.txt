 Energy restriction (ER) causes metabolic improvement prediabetic diabetic state. Little information exists mechanism action ER, example, changes transcriptional gene level insulin-sensitive tissues. gain insight, investigated changes gene expressions skeletal muscle, liver, fat, pancreatic islets ER male Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Eighteen Zucker diabetic fatty rats divided age 7 weeks control group (ad libitum diet) ER group (30% ER compared control group). Blood glucose, weight, food intake measured weekly. 5 weeks, blood samples, skeletal muscle, liver, visceral fat (epididymal fat pads), islets tissue collected. Gene expression quantified high-density oligonucleotide, microarray GeneChip technology. ER ameliorated development hyperglycemia, increased levels plasma insulin, reduced plasma total cholesterol glucagon-insulin ratio (P < .05). skeletal muscle, expression 55 genes increased 245 decreased involving genes related glucose metabolism (eg, phosphorylase kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4), lipid metabolism (eg, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, fatty acid transporter), signaling pathways (eg, mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase C). liver, expression 123 genes increased 103 decreased involving genes related primarily lipid metabolism. pancreatic islets, expression 110 genes increased 127 decreased, whereas visceral fat, expression 279 genes increased 528 decreased. ER counteracts development diabetes causes changes expression multiple genes involved glucose lipid metabolism skeletal muscle, liver, pancreatic islets, may play important role prevention diabetes.
