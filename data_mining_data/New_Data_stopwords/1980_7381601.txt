 Weanling rats fed either vitamin E-deficient diet deficient diet supplemented vitamin E antioxidant ethoxyquin. Ethoxyquin effective preventing elevation platelet number percent aggregation. However, ethoxyquin effective vitamin E maintaining body weight, testes weight, pigmentation incisors preventing myopathy, observed either histologically elevation plasma glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) activity. Removal ethoxyquin diet 19 weeks feeding resulted rapid onset myopathy. observations permitted us study requirement vitamin E various ages without complication cumulative pathological effects vitamin E deficiency. Ethoxyquin deleted diet 8, 20, 44 64 weeks age. requirement vitamin E reduce plasma GOT pyruvate kinase (PK) activity measured 12, 24, 48 68 weeks age. requirement vitamin E change significantly time period.
