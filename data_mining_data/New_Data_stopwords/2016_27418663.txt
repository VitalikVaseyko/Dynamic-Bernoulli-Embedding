 Pale, Soft, Exudative (PSE) broiler breast meat poor protein functionality, leads quality problems economic loss poultry industry. Proteomics applied characterize biochemical mechanisms governing tenderness, color, water-holding capacity meat. However, proteome basis PSE yet characterized broiler breast meat. Therefore, study conducted determine differences meat quality (cooking loss shear force), descriptive sensory characteristics, consumer acceptance, whole muscle proteome normal PSE-like broiler breast meat. Male Hubbard x Cobb 500 birds (n = 1,050) raised commercial houses. Prior harvest, sample broilers (n = 900) subjected short-term stress (38 degrees C 2 h), remaining broilers (n = 150) maintained control conditions (21 degrees C 2 h). Broiler breast (Pectoralis major) meat collected characterized pH24 L*24 normal (pH24 5.8 6.2, L*24 45 55) PSE-like (pH24 5.4 5.7, L*24 55 65) samples. Normal broiler breast meat lower shear force values PSE-like meat (P < 0.05). Based sensory descriptive analysis, normal cooked chicken breast meat tender juicier PSE-like breast meat (P < 0.05). Consumer sensory analysis results indicated 81% consumer panelists liked normal breast meat whereas 62% panelists liked PSE-like breast meat. Whole muscle proteome profiling identified fifteen differentially abundant proteins normal PSE-like broiler breast samples. Actin alpha, myosin heavy chain, phosphoglycerate kinase, creatine kinase type, beta-enolase, carbonic anhydrase 2, proteasome subunit alpha, pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase over-abundant (P < 0.05) PSE-like broiler breast whereas phosphoglycerate mutase-1, alpha-enolase, ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase over-abundant (P < 0.05) normal meat. Thus, results indicated differences proteome abundance could related meat quality differences normal PSE-like broiler breast meat.
