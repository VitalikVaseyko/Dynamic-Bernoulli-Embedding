 completely sequenced introns human L-type pyruvate kinase (PK) gene using published cDNA sequence. Subsequently, DNA 12 unrelated PK deficiency (PKD) patients Central European origin investigated mutations gene solid-phase sequencing. detected 10 different mutations, 9 result single amino acid alterations, whereas tenth destroys splice site. Eight 10 mutations described before. found 7 missense mutations: G994-->A (Gly-332-->Ser), G1006-->T (Ala-336-->Ser), A1081-->G (Asn-361-->Asp), G1174-->A (Ala-392-->Thr), G1493-->A (Arg-498-->His), G1529-->A (Arg-510-->Gln), C1594-->T (Arg-532-->Trp), one in-frame triplet deletion (del) well one insertion (ins): del AAG1060-62 (del Lys-354), ins AGC C1203 (ins Ser Cys-401), one splice-site mutation border intron exon 3: g/G283-->a/G. Although enzymatic properties substantially changed PK mutations, two affected amino acid positions close active site. Mutations C1594-->T, G994-->A, del AAG1060-62 splice-site mutation g/G283-->a/G detected two different patients each. Mutation G1529-->A found five different alleles. Haplotype analysis A/C polymorphism position 1705 gave evidence single origin frequent mutation PKD suggested Baronciani Beutler (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90:4324, 1993). Carrier detection prenatal diagnosis feasible affected families.
