 Staurosporine, inhibitor broad spectrum protein kinases, shown cytotoxicity several human cancer cells. However, underlying mechanism well understood. study, examined whether compound inhibitory action phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway vitro using HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Cell viability apoptosis determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay co-immunoprecipitation performed detect protein-protein interactions. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) used silence expression targeted protein. found staurosporine significantly decreased cell viability increased cell apoptosis concentration- time-dependent manner HepG2 cancer cells, along decreased expressions PDK1 protein Akt phosphorylation. Staurosporine also found enhance Omi/HtrA2 release mitochondria. Furthermore, Omi/HtrA2 directly bound PDK1. Pharmacological genetic inhibition Omi/HtrA2 restored protein levels PDK1 protected HepG2 cancer cells staurosporine-induced cell death. addition, staurosporine found activate autophagy. However, inhibition autophagy exacerbated cell death concomitant treatment staurosporine. Taken together, results indicate staurosporine induced cytotoxicity response inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway Omi/HtrA2-mediated PDK1 degradation, process provides novel mechanism staurosporine produces therapeutic effects.
