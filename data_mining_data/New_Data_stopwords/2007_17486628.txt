 response Crassostrea gigas prolonged hypoxia investigated first time analyzing metabolic branch point formed pyruvate kinase (PK) hosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). PK PEPCK cDNAs cloned sequenced. main functional domains PK sequence, binding sites ADP/ATP phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), identified whereas PEPCK sequence showed specific domain bind PEP addition kinase-1 kinase-2 motifs bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP) Mg(2+), specific PEPCKs. C-terminal extension detected first time eukaryota PK. Separation mitochondrial cytosolic fraction showed 92% PEPCK enzyme activity cytosolic gills, digestive gland, mantle muscle. PK PEPCK mRNAs enzyme activities measured muscle prolonged hypoxia 20 days. Adaptation PK hypoxic muscle transcriptional level occurred lately decreasing significantly PK mRNA level day 20 PK enzyme activity inhibited high content alanine. PEPCK mRNA ratio hypoxic muscle significantly increased day 10 simultaneously PEPCK enzyme activity. Succinate accumulation observed day 10 day 20 confirmed anaerobic pathway muscle metabolism oyster subjected hypoxia. Regulation C. gigas PEPCK muscle occurred gene transcription level PK first regulated enzyme level alanine allosteric inhibitor, molecular level fast effect hypoxia.
