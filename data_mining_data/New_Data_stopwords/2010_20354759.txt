 improve production ethanol glycerol, methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha engineered express pdc adhB genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase aldehyde dehydrogenase II Zymomonas mobilis, respectively, control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter. ethanol yield 3.3-fold higher (2.74 g l(-1)) engineered yeast compared parent strain (0.83 g l(-1)). engineering stimulate glycerol utilization recombinant strain via expression dhaD dhaKLM genes Klebsiella pneumoniae encoding glycerol dehydrogenase dehydroxyacetone kinase, respectively, resulted 3.7-fold increase (3.1 g l(-1)) ethanol yield.
