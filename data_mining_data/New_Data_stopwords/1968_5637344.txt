 1. effects premature weaning normal high-glucose diets normal weaning high-protein high-fat diets activities hepatic enzymes involved utilization glucose formation glucose gluconeogenesis rats weaning period investigated. 2. effects weaning high-glucose diets were, general, bring increases activities enzymes involved glucose utilization rapid decrease activities gluconeogenic enzymes towards normal adult values. 3. effects weaning high-fat high-protein diets were, general, lower rate increase activities enzymes involved glucose utilization, prevent decrease activity gluconeogenic enzymes occurs normal weaning. 4. changes activity cytoplasmic phosphopyruvate carboxylase appear special significance; results keeping current theories pathways control gluconeogenesis. 5. activity ATP citrate lyase appears particularly important lipid formation. 6. results interpreted terms known adaptive behaviour enzymes adult rat. roles enzyme development enzyme adaptation elaboration metabolic homoeostasis weanling rat discussed.
