 trace element vanadium potent insulinomimetic agent vitro. Oral administration vanadate rats made diabetic streptozotocin (45 mg/kg i.v.) caused 65% fall plasma glucose levels without modifying low insulinemia. studied whether hypoglycemic effect vanadate associated altered expression genes involved key steps hepatic glucose metabolism. Glucokinase (GK) L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) mRNA levels decreased respectively 90% 70% fed diabetic rats, close correlation changes enzyme activities. Eighteen days vanadate treatment partially restored GK mRNA activity (40% control levels), totally restored L-PK parameters. contrast glycolytic enzymes, mRNA levels activity gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) increased (15- 2-fold, respectively) fed diabetic rats. Vanadate treatment normalized PEPCK mRNA activity diabetic rat liver. 2-fold increase liver glucose transporter (GLUT2) mRNA protein, produced diabetes, also corrected treatment. conclusion, oral vanadate given diabetic rats induces shift predominating gluconeogenic flux, subsequent high hepatic glucose production, glycolytic flux pretranslational regulatory mechanisms.
