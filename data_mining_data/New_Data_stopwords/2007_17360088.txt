 Red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency frequent enzyme abnormality glycolysis causing chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia. disease transmitted autosomal recessive trait, clinical symptoms usually occurring compound heterozygotes two mutant alleles homozygotes. severity haemolysis highly variable, ranging mild fully compensated forms life-threatening neonatal anaemia necessitating exchange transfusions. Erythrocyte PK synthesised control PK-LR gene located chromosome 1. One hundred eighty different mutations PK-LR gene, mostly missense, far reported associated PK deficiency. First attempts delineate genotype-phenotype association mainly based analysis enzyme's three-dimensional structure observation homozygous patients. recently, comparison recombinant mutants human red cell PK wild-type enzyme enabled effects amino acid replacements enzyme molecular properties determined. However, clinical manifestations red cell enzyme defects merely dependent molecular properties mutant protein rather reflect complex interactions additional factors, including genetic background, concomitant functional polymorphisms enzymes, posttranslational epigenetic modifications, ineffective erythropoiesis differences splenic function.
