 BACKGROUND: failing heart displays increased glycolytic flux matched commensurate increase glucose oxidation. mismatch induces increased anaplerotic flux inefficient glucose metabolism. previously found adult transgenic mouse hearts expressing fetal troponin isoform, (ssTnI) protected ischemia increased glycolysis. study, investigated metabolic response adult mouse hearts expressing ssTnI chronic pressure overload. METHODS RESULTS: 2 3 months age, ssTnI mice nontransgenic littermates underwent aortic constriction (TAC). TAC induced 25% increase nontransgenic heart size 7% increase ssTnI hearts (P<0.05). Nontransgenic TAC developed diastolic dysfunction (65% increase E/A ratio), whereas E/A ratio actually decreased ssTnI TAC. Isolated perfused hearts nontransgenic TAC mice showed reduced cardiac function reduced creatine phosphate:ATP (16% reduction), ssTnI TAC hearts maintained cardiac function energy charge. Contrasting nontransgenic TAC, ssTnI TAC significantly increased glucose oxidation expense palmitate oxidation, preventing increase anaplerosis observed nontransgenic TAC hearts. Elevated glucose oxidation mediated reduction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression, enabling pyruvate dehydrogenase compete anaplerotic enzymes pyruvate carboxylation. CONCLUSIONS: Expression single fetal myofilament protein adulthood ssTnI-transgenic mouse heart induced downregulation gene expression response pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pressure overload. consequence elevated pyruvate oxidation ssTnI TAC reduced anaplerotic flux, ameliorating inefficiencies glucose oxidation, energetic functional protection cardiac decompensation.
