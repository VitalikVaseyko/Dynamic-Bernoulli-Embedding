 effect treatment rats bacterial endotoxin gluconeogenesis flux pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) measured isolated hepatocytes, prepared animals starved 18 h, incubated presence 1 mM pyruvate. lipopolysaccharide reduced gluconeogenesis 50% lowered flux pyruvate kinase, PEPCK pyruvate carboxylase comparable amounts. effect endotoxaemia PDH flux, indicating lowered rate gluconeogenesis result redistribution pyruvate metabolism oxidation carboxylation. results confirm stimulation pyruvate kinase activity following treatment lipopolysaccharide involved inhibition gluconeogenesis, effect resides level phosphoenolpyruvate formation. favoured mechanism inhibition glucose synthesis via inhibition PEPCK subsequent feedback inhibition pyruvate carboxylase, although secondary effect level mitochondria pyruvate carboxylase cannot excluded.
