 Rapidly proliferating solid tumor cells often dependent glycolysis ATP production even normoxia (the Warburg effect), however yet clear whether acute leukemias similarly increased dependence aerobic glycolysis. report acute leukemia subtypes (pre-B ALL, T-ALL AML) demonstrated growth arrest cell death treated novel glycolysis inhibitor 3-BrOP. Potentiated ATP depletion pro-apoptotic effects seen 3-BrOP combinations cytochrome-c-reductase inhibitor antimycin mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. results reveal potential role glycolysis inhibition acute leukemia subtypes suggest potential combinations.
