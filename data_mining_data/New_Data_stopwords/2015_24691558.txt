 aim present study examine effect lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) regulation human skeletal muscle rest exercise. Nine young healthy physically inactive male subjects completed two trials. LPS trial, subjects received single LPS injection (0.3 ng/kg body weight) blood samples vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained 2 h LPS injection immediately 10-min one-legged knee extensor exercise bout performed approximately 2(1/2) h LPS injection. exercise bout muscle samples obtained immediately repeated control trial without LPS injection. plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration increased 17-fold 2 h LPS relative before. Muscle lactate muscle glycogen unchanged 2 h LPS exercise increased muscle lactate decreased muscle glycogen control (P < 0.05) LPS (0.05 </= P < 0.1) trial differences trials. AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) PDH phosphorylation well PDHa activity unaffected 2 h LPS relative before. Exercise decreased (P < 0.05) PDH increased (P < 0.05) AMPK ACC phosphorylation well increased (P < 0.05) PDHa activity similarly LPS control trial. conclusion, LPS-induced inflammation affect resting exercise-induced AMPK PDH regulation human skeletal muscle. suggests metabolic flexibility exercise maintained short-term low-grade inflammation humans.
