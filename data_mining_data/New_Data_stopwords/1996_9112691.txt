 Chitosan, product depolymerization deacetylation chitin, polycation, diminishes glycolysis, i.e. aerobic lactate formation both, Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT) intact cells cytosolic fraction. inhibiting glycolysis, chitosan decreases also glucose uptake ATP level intact cells. Chitosan exert similar inhibitory effect glycolytic activity mouse normal liver muscle supernatants. found decrease glycolytic activity cell ATP level tumour cells caused inhibition tumour specific variant pyruvate kinase fraction B (isoenzyme M2).
