 PURPOSE: Hyperpolarized metabolic imaging potential revolutionize diagnosis management diseases metabolism dysregulated, heart disease. investigated feasibility imaging rodent myocardial metabolism high resolution 7 T. METHODS: present fly-back spectral-spatial radiofrequency pulse sidestepped maximum gradient strength requirements enabled high resolution metabolic imaging rodent myocardium. 3D echo-planar imaging readout followed, centric ordered z-phase encoding. cardiac gated sequence used image metabolism rodents whose metabolic state manipulated fasted, fed, fed given pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate. RESULTS: imaged hyperpolarized metabolites spatial resolution 2x2x3.8 mm(3) temporal resolution 1.8 rat heart 7 T. Significant differences myocardial pyruvate dehydrogenase flux observed three groups animals, concomitant known biochemistry. CONCLUSION: proposed sequence able image vivo metabolism excellent spatial resolution rat heart. field view enabled simultaneous multi-organ acquisition metabolic information rat, great utility preclinical research cardiovascular disease.
