 Muscle activation well changes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) following high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) examined young healthy men (n = 8; age, 21.9+/-2.2 yrs; VO2peak, 53.1+/-6.4 ml/min/kg; peak work rate, 317+/-23.5 watts). 3 visits HIIE performed cycle ergometer target intensity 73, 100, 133% peak work rate. Muscle biopsies taken rest three hours exercise condition. Total work different conditions ( approximately 730 kJ) average power output (73%, 237+/-21; 100%, 323+/-26; 133%, 384+/-35 watts) EMG derived muscle activation (73%, 1262+/-605; 100%, 2089+/-737; 133%, 3029+/-1206 total integrated EMG per interval) increased intensity dependent fashion. PGC-1alpha mRNA elevated three conditions (p<0.05), greater increase observed following 100% condition ( approximately 9 fold, p<0.05) compared 73 133% conditions ( approximately 4 fold). expressed relative muscle activation, increase PGC-1alpha mRNA 133% condition less 73 100% conditions (p<0.05). SIRT1 mRNA also elevated three conditions ( approximately 1.4 fold, p<0.05), difference conditions. findings suggest intensity-dependent increases PGC-1alpha mRNA following submaximal exercise largely due increases muscle recruitment. well, blunted response PGC-1alpha mRNA expression following supramaximal exercise may indicate signalling mediated activation PGC-1alpha may also blunted. also indentify increases PDK4, SIRT1, RIP140 mRNA following acute exercise dissociated exercise intensity muscle activation, increases EGR1 augmented supramaximal HIIE (p<0.05).
