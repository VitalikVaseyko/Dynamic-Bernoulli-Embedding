 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) crucial cofactor redox reactions metabolic pathways cancer cells elevated aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Cancer cells reported rely NAD recycling inhibition NAD salvage pathway causes metabolic collapse cell death. However, underlying regulatory mechanisms clinical implications NAD salvage pathway pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. study showed expression Nampt, rate-limiting enzyme NAD salvage pathway, significantly increased PDAC cells PDAC tissues. Additionally, inhibition Nampt impaired tumor growth vitro tumorigenesis vivo, accompanied decreased cellular NAD level glycolytic activity. Mechanistically, Nampt expression independent Kras p16 status, directly regulated miR-206, inversely correlated expression Nampt PDAC tissues. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition Nampt inhibitor, FK866, significantly enhanced antitumor activity gemcitabine PDAC cells orthotopic xenograft mouse models. conclusion, present study revealed novel regulatory mechanism Nampt PDAC suggested Nampt inhibition may override gemcitabine resistance decreasing NAD level suppressing glycolytic activity, warranting clinical investigation pancreatic cancer treatment.
