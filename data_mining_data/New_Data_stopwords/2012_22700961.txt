 early initiation phase acute inflammation anabolic primarily requires glycolysis reduced mitochondrial glucose oxidation energy, whereas later adaptation phase catabolic primarily requires fatty acid oxidation energy. reported previously switching early late acute inflammatory response following TLR4 stimulation depends NAD(+) activation deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SirT1). Here, tested whether NAD(+) sensing sirtuins couples metabolic polarity acute inflammatory response. found TLR4-stimulated THP-1 promonocytes SirT1 SirT 6 support switch increased glycolysis increased fatty acid oxidation early inflammation converts late inflammation. Glycolysis enhancement required hypoxia-inducing factor-1alpha up-regulate glucose transporter Glut1, phospho-fructose kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, interrupted pyruvate dehydrogenase reduced mitochondrial glucose oxidation. shift late acute inflammation elevated fatty acid oxidation required peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivators PGC-1alpha beta increase external membrane CD36 fatty acid mitochondrial transporter carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1. Metabolic coupling early late responses also required NAD(+) production nicotinamide phosphoryltransferase (Nampt) activation SirT6 reduce glycolysis SirT1 increase fatty oxidation. confirmed similar shifts metabolic polarity late immunosuppressed stage human sepsis blood leukocytes murine sepsis splenocytes. conclude NAD(+)-dependent bioenergy shifts link metabolism early late stages acute inflammation.
