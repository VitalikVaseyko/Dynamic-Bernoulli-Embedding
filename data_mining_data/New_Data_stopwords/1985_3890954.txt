 interaction fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate ADP pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) yeast rabbit muscle studied function pH utilizing quenching protein fluorescence 330 nm ligands. muscle yeast pyruvate kinase interact either ADP phosphoenolpyruvate similar affinity, indicating substrate-binding sites two isozymes similar. major difference yeast muscle isozymes affinity fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate interacts yeast isozyme orders magnitude strongly muscle isozyme. Moreover, affinity fructose 1,6-bisphosphate yeast isozyme strongly pH-dependent, interaction fructose 1,6-bisphosphate muscle isozyme independent pH. data indicate yeast pyruvate kinase undergoes conformational change pH increased 6.0 8.5.
