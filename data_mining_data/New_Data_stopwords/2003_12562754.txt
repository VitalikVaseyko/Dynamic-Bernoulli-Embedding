 nature proton donor C-3 enolate pyruvate, intermediate reaction catalyzed yeast pyruvate kinase, investigated site-directed mutagenesis physical kinetic analyses. Thr-298 correctly located function proton donor. T298S T298A constructed purified. mutants catalytically active decrease k(cat) k(cat)/K(m)(,PEP). Mn(2+)-activated T298S T298A exhibit homotropic kinetic cooperativity phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) absence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, although PEP binding enzyme-Mn(2+) cooperative. pH dependence k(cat) T298A indicates loss pK(a)(,2) = 6.4-6.9. Thr-298 affects ionization (pK(a) approximately 6.5) responsible modulation k(cat). Fluorescence studies show altered dissociation constants ligands enzyme complex upon Thr-298 mutations. rates phosphoryl transfer proton transfer steps pyruvate kinase-catalyzed reaction altered; pyruvate enolization affected greater extent. Proton inventory studies demonstrate solvent isotope effects k(cat) k(cat)/K(m)(,PEP). Fractionation factors metal-dependent significantly <1. data suggest water molecule water channel direct proton donor enolpyruvate Thr-298 affects late step catalysis.
