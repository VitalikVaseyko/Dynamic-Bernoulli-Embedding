 Despite well-documented clinical significance Warburg effect, remains unclear aggressive glycolytic rates tumor cells might contribute hallmarks cancer, bypass senescence. Here, report that, oncogene- DNA damage-induced senescence, Pak1-mediated phosphorylation phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) predisposes glycolytic enzyme ubiquitin-mediated degradation. identify Mdm2 direct binding partner ubiquitin ligase PGAM cultured cells vitro. Mutations PGAM Mdm2 abrogate ubiquitination PGAM restored proliferative potential primary cells stress conditions promoted neoplastic transformation. propose Mdm2, downstream effector p53, attenuates Warburg effect via ubiquitination degradation PGAM.
