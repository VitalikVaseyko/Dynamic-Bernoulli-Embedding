 activities enzymes related energy metabolism gastrocnemius soleus muscles young-adult (4 months), mature (12 months) senescent (24 months) rats compared 72 h continuous exposure normobaric hypoxia normoxia alpha-adrenergic antagonist nicergoline saline solution given intraperitoneally 30 consecutive days. maximum rates (Vmax) following enzyme activities crude extract and/or mitochondrial fraction muscle specimen evaluated: (1) anaerobic glycolytic pathway: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase; (2) tricarboxylic acid cycle; citrate synthase malate dehydrogenase; (3) electron transfer chain; cytochrome oxidase; (4) NAD+/NADH redox state: total NADH cytochrome c reductase. significant differences enzyme activities different ages different experimental conditions two tissue preparations two muscles determined ANOVA. MCA ETA used evaluate net effects experimental conditions. Ageing seem affect soleus gastrocnemius muscles way. Changes seen glycolytic pathway enzymes crude extract gastrocnemius muscle. soleus muscle changes enzyme activities function ageing also found mitochondrial fraction. also found hypoxia caused greater changes 12-month-old rats ages (especially enzyme activities gastrocnemius muscle). Finally data show certain cases pharmacological treatment able modify influence hypoxic conditions levels enzyme activities, regardless age animals.
