 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression resulting uncontrolled migration enhanced angiogenesis obstacle effective therapeutic intervention. Tumor metabolism distinctive feature called Warburg effect, enhances aerobic glycolysis rapidly supplying energy migration tumor. manipulate metabolic change characteristic aggressive tumors, utilized citrus extract, auraptene, known mitochondrial inhibitor, testing anticancer effects RCC4 cell line. found auraptene impaired RCC4 cell motility reduction mitochondrial respiration glycolytic pathway-related genes. also strongly disrupted VEGF-induced angiogenesis vitro vivo. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a), key regulator cancer metabolism, migration angiogenesis stably expressed RCCs virtue genetic mutation von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor protein, impeded auraptene, blocked HIF-1a translation initiation without causing cytotoxicity. suggest blockade HIF-1a reforming energy metabolism auraptene effective approach suspension RCC progression.
