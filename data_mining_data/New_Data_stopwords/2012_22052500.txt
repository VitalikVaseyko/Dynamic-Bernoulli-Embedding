 Identification allosteric binding site modulators gained increased attention lately potential developed selective agents novel chemotype targeting perhaps new unique binding site probable fewer side effects. Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (R-PK) important glycolytic enzyme pharmacologically modulated allosteric effectors treatment hemolytic anemia, sickle-cell anemia, hypoxia-related diseases, disorders arising erythrocyte PK malfunction. in-silico screening approach applied identify novel allosteric modulators pyruvate kinase. small-molecules database National Cancer Institute (NCI), virtually screened based structure/ligand-based pharmacophore. virtual screening campaign led identification several compounds similar pharmacophoric features fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), natural allosteric activator kinase. compounds subsequently docked FBP-binding site using programs FlexX GOLD, interactions protein analyzed energy-scoring function HINT. Seven promising candidates obtained NCI subjected kinetics analysis, revealed activators inhibitors R-isozyme PK (R-PK).
