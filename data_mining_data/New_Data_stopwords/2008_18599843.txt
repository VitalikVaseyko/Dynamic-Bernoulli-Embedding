 inactivation sll0776 (spkD), gene encoding protein Ser/Thr kinase Synechocystis PCC 6803, led pleiotropic phenotype SpkD null mutant. mutant impaired growth ability low concentration inorganic carbon (C(i)), though C(i)-uptake system affected. Addition glucose, phosphoglyceraldehyde pyruvate allow mutant grow low-C(i) conditions. contrast, growth defect restored low-C(i) culture medium supplemented metabolites TCA cycle. Growth mutant also inhibited ammonium provided nitrogen source, whatever carbon regime cells, due high demand 2-oxoglutarate, carbon skeleton ammonium assimilation. mutant cells cultured standard growth conditions, intracellular concentration 2-oxoglutarate 20 % lower observed wild-type strain. However, decrease 2-oxoglutarate level slightly affects phosphorylation state PII, protein regulates nitrogen carbon metabolism according intracellular levels 2-oxoglutarate. Properties SpkD mutant suggest Ser/Thr kinase SpkD could involved adjusting pool TCA cycle metabolites according C(i) supply culture medium.
