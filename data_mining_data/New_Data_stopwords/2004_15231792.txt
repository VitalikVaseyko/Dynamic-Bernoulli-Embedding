 Denitrification arginine fermentation central metabolic processes performed opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation infection lungs patients cystic fibrosis. Genome-wide searches additional components anaerobic metabolism identified potential genes pyruvate-metabolizing NADH-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), phosphotransacetylase (pta), acetate kinase (ackA). pyruvate fermentation alone sustain significant anaerobic growth P. aeruginosa, provides bacterium metabolic capacity long-term survival 18 days. Detected conversion pyruvate lactate acetate dependent presence intact ldhA ackA-pta loci, respectively. DNA microarray studies combination reporter gene fusion analysis enzyme activity measurements demonstrated anr- ihfA-dependent anaerobic induction ackA-pta promoter. Potential Anr integration host factor binding sites localized. Pyruvate-dependent anaerobic long-term survival found significantly reduced anr ihfA mutants. obvious ldhA regulation oxygen tension observed. Pyruvate fermentation pH dependent. Nitrate respiration abolished pyruvate fermentation, arginine fermentation occurs independently pyruvate utilization.
