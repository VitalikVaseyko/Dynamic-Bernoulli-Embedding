 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) purified homogeneity moderately halophilic bacterium Vibrio costicola. enzyme monomeric, Mr 62,000, determined Svedberg equation, using values s0(20,w) 4.4 x 10(-13) s, D20,w 6.13 x 10(-7) cm2.s-1 v 0.719 cm3.g-1. Compared other, non-halophilic, PEPCKs, enzyme V. costicola significantly lower total content hydrophobic amino acids. contents glycine serine higher V. costicola enzyme (16.7 10.22% respectively) non-halophilic PEPCKs (6.8-9.6% 4.67-6.28% respectively). results resemble obtained De Medicis & Rossignol [(1979) Experientia 35, 1546-1547] pyruvate kinase V. costicola, agree proposal Lanyi [(1974) Bacteriol. Rev. 38, 272-290] partial replacement hydrophobic amino acids glycine serine maintain balance hydrophobic hydrophilic forces halophilic enzymes. agreement 'halophilic' characteristic, PEPCK somewhat stabilized 1 M-KCl -NaCl 20% (v/v) glycerol, oxaloacetate-decarboxylation 14CO2-oxaloacetate-exchange reactions activated KCl NaCl 1 M, whereas fixation CO2 PEP maximum 0.025-0.05 salt. facts suggest salts, concentrations probably physiological bacterium, increase formation complex oxaloacetate ATP enzyme, liberation products, PEP ADP, thus favouring PEP synthesis.
