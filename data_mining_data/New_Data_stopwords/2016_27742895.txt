 previously reported rats mice raised 30 generations La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m), display divergent physiological responses high altitude, including improved respiratory metabolic control mice. present study, asked whether traits would also present response hypoxia sea level. answer question, exposed rats (Sprague Dawley) mice (FVB) normoxia (21% O2) hypoxia (15 12% O2) 6 h measured ventilation metabolic rate (whole-body plethysmography), expression transcription factor HIF-1alpha (ELISA mass spectrometry) proteins whose expression regulated hypoxia (glucose transporter 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 angiopoietin 2; mass spectrometry) brainstem. response hypoxia, compared rats, mice higher minute ventilation, lower metabolic rate higher expression HIF-1alpha brainstem. mice, expression level HIF-1alpha positively correlated ventilation negatively correlated metabolic rate. rats, concentration brainstem cytosolic protein decreased 38% 12% O2, expression glucose transporter 1 increased. conclude mice rats raised sea level divergent physiological molecular responses hypoxia, supporting hypothesis mice innate traits favor adaptation altitude.
