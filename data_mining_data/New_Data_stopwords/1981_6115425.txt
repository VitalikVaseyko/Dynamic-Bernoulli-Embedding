 phosphoryl transferring enzymes pyruvate kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase pyrophosphoryl transferring enzyme PP-Rib-P synthetase utilize beta, gamma bidentate metal--ATP chelate (delta-isomer) substrate, determined substitution-insert CrIIIATP CoIII(NH3)4ATP complexes. addition, enzymes bind second divalent cation, essential activator pyruvate kinase PP-Rib-P synthetase inhibitor protein kinase. enzyme-bound metal used paramagnetic reference point T1 measurements determine distances protons phosphorus atoms bound nucleotide acceptor substrates. distances used construct models conformations bound substrates. activating metal forms second sphere complex metal-nucleotide substrate pyruvate kinase PP-Rib-P synthetase inhibitory metal directly coordinates polyphosphate chain metal-nucleotide substrate protein kinase. Essentially change found dihedral angle glycosidic bond ATP upon binding pyruvate kinase (chi = 30 degrees), enzyme low base specificity, significant changes torsional angle ATP occur binding protein kinase (chi = 84 degrees) PP-Rib-P synthetase (chi = 62 degrees), enzymes high adenine-base specificity. Intersubstrate distances, measured tridentate CrATP beta, gamma bidentate CrAMPPCP paramagnetic reference points, used deduce distance along reaction coordinate enzyme. reaction coordinate distances pyruvate kinase (# +/- 1 A) PP-Rib-P synthetase (not less 3.8 A) consistent associative mechanisms, protein kinase (5 +/- 0.7 A) allows room dissociative mechanism.
