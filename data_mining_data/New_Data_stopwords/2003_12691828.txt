 Tumor markers used disease monitoring lung cancer patients. goal pilot study determine diagnostic efficiency new tumor metabolic marker, Tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (Tumor M2-PK) detection tumor growth inoperable lung cancer patients.Fifty-seven consecutive primary inoperable lung cancer patients included prospective study. Changes plasma levels Tumor M2-PK compared clinical course disease. Clinical monitoring evaluated according standard criteria WHO. 57 patients, 19 remission, 18 showed signs stable disease 20 tumor progressions therapy. follow-up treatment, tumor relapse occurred 30 patients. Tumor M2-PK measured plasma treatment well time relapse. tumor remission Tumor M2-PK levels decreased significantly treatment (P=0.0004). might expected, pre- post-treatment marker concentrations differ significantly patients stable disease. progressive lung cancer patients significant increase Tumor M2-PK detectable (P=0.0094). Overall, decrease Tumor M2-PK seen 17 (89%) responders, increase could detected 16 (80%) patients experiencing tumor progression. treatment tumor relapse occurred 30 patients. Tumor M2-PK increased significantly (P=0.0201) time relapse 17 patients non-small cell lung cancers exceeded cut-off 11 17 (65%). conclusion, Tumor M2-PK proved useful diagnostic aid therapy control lung cancer patients. marker also used detect tumor relapse treatment. Tumor M2-PK could well suited complete present diagnostic panel monitoring inoperable lung cancer patients.
