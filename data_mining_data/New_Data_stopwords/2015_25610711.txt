 Glioblastoma (GBM) one lethal human cancers. Genomic analyses define molecular architecture GBM highlight central function mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. mTOR kinase exists two multi-protein complexes, namely, mTORC1 mTORC2. complexes differ terms function, regulation rapamycin sensitivity. mTORC1 well established cancer drug target, whereas functions mTORC2 cancer, including GBM, remains poorly understood. study reviews recent findings demonstrate central function mTORC2 regulating tumor growth, metabolic reprogramming, targeted therapy resistance GBM, makes mTORC2 critical GBM drug target.
