 importance glycolytic flux success Biomphalaria-Schistosome sporocyst interaction acertained study. Hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase(PK), glucose phosphate isomerase(GPI) lactate dehydrogenase (LD) four important glycolytic enzymes markedly stimulated trematode infected Biomphalaria alexandrina measured two weeks post exposure infection Schistosoma mansoni miracidia. hand phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) fructose 1,6 diphosphatase(FDPase) three gluconeogenic enzymes slightly affected confirm importance glycolytic pathway schistosome-exposed snails. Effect LC25 Solanum nigrum leaves dry powder plant molluscicide HK, PK GPI tested. Treatment plant resulted significant inhibition three investigated enzymes. LC10 concentrations S. nigrum reduced considerably infection rate B. alexandrina S. mansoni 34% compared infection rate 80% control, non-treated snails. Longer prepatent period remarkable decrease cercarial production also recorded snails treated sublethal concentrations molluscicide. conclusion, susceptibility B. alexandrina infection digenetic trematode S. mansoni correlated activity levels glycolytic enzymes. Moreover, sublethal less pollutant concentration S. nigrum could recommended control schistosomiasis disturbing intramolluscan environment parasite.
