 Recombinant cellulose-binding domain (CBD) derived cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium cellulovorans found modulate elongation different plant cells vitro. peach (Prunus persica L.) pollen tubes, maximum elongation observed 50 &mgr;g mL-1 CBD. Pollen tube staining calcofluor showed loss crystallinity tip zone CBD-treated pollen tubes. low concentrations CBD enhanced elongation Arabidopsis roots. high concentrations CBD dramatically inhibited root elongation dose-responsive manner. Maximum effect root hair elongation 100 &mgr;g mL-1, whereas root elongation inhibited concentration. CBD found compete xyloglucan binding cellulose CBD added first cellulose, addition xyloglucan. Acetobacter xylinum L. used model system, CBD found increase rate cellulose synthase dose-responsive manner, 5-fold compared control. Electron microscopy examination cellulose ribbons produced A. xylinum showed CBD treatment resulted splayed ribbon composed separate fibrillar subunits, compared thin, uniform ribbon control.
