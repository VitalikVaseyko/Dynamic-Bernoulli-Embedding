 isomerization 3-phospho-D-glycerate 2-phospho-D-glycerate catalyzed cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase wheat germ (the isolation crystallization described Appendix) shown intramolecular two methods. Mass-spectrometric analysis products isomerization mixture 3-phospho-D-[2(-2)H]glycerate 3-[18O]phospho-D-glycerate shows exchange labeled phosphoryl group carbon skeletons mutase-catalyzed reaction. Analysis products isomerization mixture 3-phospho-D-[2(-2)H]glycerate 3-[32p]phospho-D-glycerate method involving kinetic discrimination 2(-2)H 2(-1)H species using enolase isotope effect similarly shows wheat germ phosphoglycerate mutase mediates intramolecular transfer phosphoryl group.
