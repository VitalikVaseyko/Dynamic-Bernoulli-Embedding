 Despite many studies suggesting role enolpyruvate bound intermediate pyruvate kinase reaction, direct evidence lacking. use combination chemical trapping isolation derivative, significant amounts enzyme-bound enolpyruvate demonstrated. method distinguishes enolpyruvate. based reaction bromine enolpyruvate acid, derivatization formed bromopyruvate thionitrobenzoate, resolution reversed-phase HPLC thioether derivative. little 10 pmol thioether derivative could quantitated reliably. method, internal equilibria, including E.ATP.enolpyruvate intermediate, determined. Enzyme-enolpyruvate concentration shown pH-dependent. Phosphoenolpyruvate also reacts bromine form bromopyruvate. quantitate enolpyruvate specifically background phosphoenolpyruvate, advantage taken phosphoenolpyruvate's much greater stability acid. bromide/was added 10 min acid quench, ketonization enolpyruvate complete, phosphoenolpyruvate measured. Enolpyruvate thus determined difference bromopyruvate measured without delayed bromine addition.
