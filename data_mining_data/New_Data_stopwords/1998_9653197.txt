 Hibernation physiological adaptation characterized dramatic decreases heart rate, body temperature, metabolism, resulting long-term dormancy. Hibernating mammals survive periods 6 mo absence food minimizing carbohydrate catabolism using triglyceride stores primary source fuel. cellular molecular mechanisms underlying changes state activity hibernating state poorly understood; however, selective expression genes offers one level control. address problem, used differential gene expression screen identify genes responsible physiological characteristics hibernation heart thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus). Here, report genes pancreatic lipase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 up-regulated heart hibernation. Pancreatic lipase normally expressed exclusively pancreas, expressed hibernating heart liberates fatty acids triglycerides temperatures low 0 degreesC. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 inhibits carbohydrate oxidation depresses metabolism preventing conversion pyruvate Ac-CoA. resulting anaerobic glycolysis low-temperature lipid catabolism provide evidence adaptive changes cardiac physiology controlled differential expression genes hibernation.
