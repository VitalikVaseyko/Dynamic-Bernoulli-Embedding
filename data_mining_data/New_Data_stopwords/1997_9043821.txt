 PURPOSE: present study aimed evaluating early changes glycolysis, redox state free cytosolic NAD(P)-couples, adenine nucleotide system lens control 50% galactose-fed rats, possibility preventing aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI). METHODS: Experiments performed male Sprague-Dawley rats fed galactose diet 2-14 days. levels glucose, galactose, glycolytic intermediates, alpha-glycerophosphate, malate, NAD, ATP, ADP, AMP assayed spectrofluorometrically individual lenses enzymatic procedures, galactitol myo-inositol quantified GC-MS. Free cytosolic NAD+/NADH, NADP+/NADPH, ATP/ADP x P(i) (phosphate potential) estimated lactate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, triose phosphate isomerase-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-3-phosphoglycerate kinase systems. Lactate pyruvate production lenses control galactose-fed rats measured set vitro incubation studies (2 hr, 37 degrees C, Krebs bicarbonate-Hepes buffer, pH 7.45, 5mM glucose 5mM glucose + 30 mM galactose, respectively). RESULTS: Lens galactitol levels 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14-day galactose-fed rats 48 +/- 8, 58 +/- 9, 68 +/- 8, 73 +/- 5, 81 +/- 20, 75 +/- 11 mmol/g wet weight (mean +/- SD), respectively. NAD+/NADH ratios indistinguishable controls 2-6 days galactose diet, fell dramatically 8 10 days, correlate polyol accumulation per se. pattern glycolytic intermediates (no change G6P, F6P, 3-PG, increase GA3P, decrease FDP, PEP, pyruvate, lactate), well reduced vitro lactate pyruvate production, suggest inhibition glycolysis sites phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase. ATP levels well total ATP/ADP, ATP/ADP x Pi, adenylate charge, cytosolic phosphate potential decreased galactose-fed rats, galactose 1-phosphate a-glycerophosphate levels well NADP+/NADPH ratio increased. Lens galactitol levels reduced approximately 57% 10-day galactose-fed rats treated ARI (tolrestat, 100 mg/kg bwt/day, 6-day pretreatment); changes lower segment glycolysis, alpha-glycerophosphate levels, redox state NAD-couples, energy metabolism partially prevented NADP+/ NADPH ratios unchanged galactose 1-phosphate levels increased. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed glycolysis lens galactose-fed rats consistent decreased NAD+/NADPH adenine nucleotide phosphorylation. Early changes lens glucose utilization, redox state NAD-couples, energy metabolism model galactosemia similar diabetes, least part mediated aldose reductase involved mechanisms, partially prevented aldose reductase inhibitor.
