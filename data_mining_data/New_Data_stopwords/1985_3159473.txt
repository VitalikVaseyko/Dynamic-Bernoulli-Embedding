 6-Phosphofructokinase (PFK) plays central role regulation glycolysis normal neoplastic cells. Since PFK also mediates Pasteur effect, coordinates two modes energy production cell systems, i.e., glycolysis respiration. energy production cancer cell characterized predominance aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) diminution lack Pasteur effect. Previous studies laboratory demonstrated PFK humans rat exists multiple tetrameric isozymic forms consisting three unique subunits separate genetic controls, M, L, P types. isozymes distinguishable one another ion-exchange chromatography subunit-specific antibodies. Various organs exhibit unique isozyme distribution patterns essentially reflect preferred mode carbohydrate metabolism utilized, i.e., glycolysis gluconeogenesis both. order investigate whether high aerobic glycolysis cancer cell explained basis lack regulatory function PFK due altered isozyme distribution pattern, compared activity isozymic profile enzyme malignant cells human leukemias, lymphomas, virus-transformed cell lines, established malignant cell lines lymphoid, myeloid, erythroid, fibroblastic origin normal counterparts. myeloid erythroid cell lines also investigated vitro differentiation induced dimethyl sulfoxide, sodium butyrate, hemin, etc. results show that, case hexokinase pyruvate kinase, two rate-limiting enzymes glycolysis, PFK shows quantitative increases isozymic alterations secondary altered gene expression neoplastic transformation, vivo vitro. contradistinction isozymic alteration hexokinase pyruvate kinase, highly regulated liver-type isozymes decrease disappear replaced nonregulated ones, case PFK, highly regulated liver-type isozyme persists actually increases, followed increase platelet-type isozyme. isozymic alterations closely parallel quantitative increases total PFK activity, turn closely related rate replication cancer cells hence increase metabolism. Thus, human PFK transformation- progression-linked discriminant malignancy (For definitions terms, see Weber et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 296: 486-493, 1977.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
