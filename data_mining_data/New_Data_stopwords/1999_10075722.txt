 cloned 5' upstream region rat glucagon receptor gene, demonstrating 5' noncoding domain glucagon receptor mRNA contained two untranslated exons 131 166 nucleotides (nt), respectively, separated two introns 0.6 3.2 kilobase pairs. also observed alternative splicing involving 166-base pair exon. Cloning 2 kilobase pairs newly identified genomic domain transfection various constructs driving reporter gene, pancreatic islet cell line INS-1, uncovered strong glucose regulation promoter activity plasmids containing nucleotide -868, more, upstream transcriptional start point. promoter activity displayed threshold-like behavior, low activity promoter 5 mM glucose, maximal activation 10 mM glucose. glucose regulation mapped highly palindromic 19-nucleotide region nt -545 -527. Indeed, deletion mutation sequence abolished glucose regulation. domain contained two palindromic "E-boxes" CACGTG CAGCTG separated 3 nt, feature similar "L4 box" found pyruvate kinase L gene promoter. first description G protein-coupled receptor gene promoter regulated glucose.
