 main sources heterogeneity pyruvate kinase (PK) isoenzymes discussed. regulative role L-type PK energy metabolism tissue without glyconeogenesis examined erythrocytes. purpose kinetic model PK established taking account substrates effectors ATP fructose-1,6.biphosphate. PK model incorporated complex mathematical model glycolysis concentrations metabolites glycolytic flux calculated normal PK activity PK activity ten times lower normal. calculations concluded conditions PK deficiency energy metabolism cannot stabilized. corresponds experimental finding filtration constant PK deficient red blood cells increases declining survival time.
