 studies undertaken determine mechanism intravenously administered lead salts inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis. Within 1 h intravenous administration lead acetate (10 mg), 97% inhibition CO2 fixation isolated rat liver mitochondria. effect concentration-dependent. induction phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity observed starvation also inhibited intravenously administered lead acetate, activities pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate carboxylase unaffected, oxidation palmitate palmitoyl-CoA mitochondria Pb2+-treated animals. addition reduced glutathione mitochondria Pb2+-treated animals effect inhibited CO2 fixation. ATP concentrations mitochondria Pb2+-treated animals decreased dose-response relationships effect Pb2+ CO2 fixation ATP concentrations correspond. conclude decrease mitochondrial ATP Pb2+-treated animals probably responsible marked inhibition ov CO2 fixation, hence impairment gluconeogenesis alanine, lactate pyruvate observed others.
