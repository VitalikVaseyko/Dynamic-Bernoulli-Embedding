 Investigating causes increased aerobic glycolysis tumors (Warburg Effect) gone fashion many times since first described almost century ago. field currently ascendance due two factors. million FDG-PET studies unequivocally identified increased glucose uptake hallmark metastatic cancer humans. observations, combined new molecular insights HIF-1alpha c-myc, rekindled interest important phenotype. preponderance work focused molecular mechanisms underlying effect, expectation mechanistic understanding may lead novel therapeutic approaches. also implicit assumption mechanistic understanding, although fundamentally reductionist, nonetheless lead profound teleological understanding need altered metabolism invasive cancers. communication, describe alternative approach begins teleology; i.e. adaptive landscapes selection pressures promote emergence aerobic glycolysis somatic evolution invasive cancer. Mathematical models empirical observations used define adaptive advantage aerobic glycolysis would explain remarkable prevalence human cancers. studies led hypothesis increased consumption glucose metastatic lesions used substantial energy production via Embden-Meyerhoff glycolysis, rather production acid, gives cancer cells competitive advantage invasion. Alternative hypotheses, wherein glucose used generation reducing equivalents (NADPH) anabolic precursors (ribose) also discussed.
