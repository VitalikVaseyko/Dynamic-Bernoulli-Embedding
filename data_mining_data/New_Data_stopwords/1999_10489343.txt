 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein paramyxovirus SV5 internalized cell surface via clathrin-coated pits. However, cytoplasmic domain SV5 HN contain previously characterized internalization motif. cell-surface-expressed chimeric protein (APK), consisting cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane (TM) domain, 12 residues ectodomain HN joined cytoplasmic protein pyruvate kinase internalized, indicating N-terminal region HN contains internalization signal. Although SV5 HN internalized rate similar influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) mutant Y543, contains degenerate tyrosine-based signal cytoplasmic tail, elimination majority HN cytoplasmic tail, substitution HN TM domain leucine residues, affect rate HN internalization. HN protein closely related virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), internalized cell surface. Working usual convention TM domain consists hydrophobic residues bounded two charged residues, analysis internalization mutant chimeric NDV HN molecules indicates first seven SV5 HN ectodomain residues critical internalization HN. glutamic acid residue (E37) abuts presumptive HN TM domain/ectodomain boundary important SV5 HN internalization.
