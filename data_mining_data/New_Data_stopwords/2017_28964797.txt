 Macrophage polarization determines timing switch inflammation phase inflammation resolution phase acute myocardial infarction. aim present study investigate whether omega-alkynyl arachidonic acid could mitigate inflammatory lipid mediators regulation macrophage phenotypes functions special regard myocardial infarction. initially discovered omega-alkynyl arachidonic acid selectively suppressed up-regulation inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) LPS-stimulated macrophages. omega-Alkynyl arachidonic acid also reduced expression macrophage M1 biomarkers (e.g., TNF-alpha, CXCL10, iNOS IL-6) increased expression macrophage M2 biomarkers (e.g., IL-10 arginase-1) LPS-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, omega-alkynyl arachidonic acid markedly enhanced phagocytotic activity macrophages fluorescently-labeled beads apoptotic H9c2 cardiac cells. investigated vivo cardioprotective activities omega-alkynyl arachidonic acid mouse model myocardial infarction. omega-Alkynyl arachidonic acid indeed reduced infarct size, cardiac damage leakage myocardial enzymes CK-MB. Mechanistic studies revealed omega-alkynyl arachidonic acid suppressed overexpression nuclear translocation glycolytic enzyme PKM2 LPS-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay suggested omega-alkynyl arachidonic acid disrupted interaction PKM2 HIF-1alpha. Consequently, omega-alkynyl arachidonic acid diminished HIF-1alpha binding HRE sequence iNOS promoter response LPS stimulation. Collectively, omega-alkynyl arachidonic acid may promote anti-inflammatory M2 polarization macrophages acute myocardial infarction via regulating cross-talk PKM2, HIF-1alpha iNOS.
