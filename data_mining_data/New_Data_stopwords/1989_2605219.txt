 Pyruvate kinase important glycolytic enzyme expressed differentially four distinct isozymes whose catalytic activity regulated tissue-specific manner. kidney isozyme known exhibit sigmoidal kinetics, whereas muscle isozyme exhibits hyperbolic kinetic properties. integration crystallographic [Stuart, D. I., Levine, M., Muirhead, H., & Stammers, D.K. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 134, 109-142] primary sequence data [Noguchi, T., Inoue, H., & Tanaka, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13807], shown primary sequence C alpha 1 C alpha 2 regions may constitute allosteric switching site. provide insights effects localized sequence change global structural functional behavior enzyme, kinetic studies wide spectrum conditions conducted muscle kidney isozymes. conditions include measurements enzyme activity function substrate concentrations different concentrations allosteric inhibitors activators. results showed isozymes exhibit regulatory properties although quantitatively distribution active inactive forms various dissociation constants govern binding substrate allosteric effectors enzyme different. majority equilibrium constants altered, localized primary sequence change must confer global perturbations manifested differences various equilibrium constants. Structural information two isozymes provided phase-modulation measurement fluorescence lifetime tryptophan residues variety experimental conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
