 8-bromo-ATP substrate nucleoside diphosphate kinase. reactivity similar ATP, reaction appears unaffected different conformations two substrates. nucleoside diphosphate kinase reaction 8-bromo-ATP cannot monitored photometrically (optical test) using NADH/NAD+-dependent enzyme system, product 8-bromo-ADP substrate pyruvate kinase. Measurements nucleoside diphosphate kinase reaction 8-bromo-ATP therefore, carried chromatographic analysis nucleoside-triphosphate/diphosphate ratio.
