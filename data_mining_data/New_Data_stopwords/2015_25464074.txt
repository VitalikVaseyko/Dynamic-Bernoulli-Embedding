 Three sugar 1-phosphates donor substrates phosphorylases produced gram scale phosphoenolpyruvic acid corresponding sugars combined action pyruvate kinase corresponding anomeric kinases good yields. sugar 1-phosphates purified two electrodialysis steps. alpha-D-Galactose 1-phosphate finally isolated crystals dipotassium salts. alpha-D-Mannose 1-phosphate 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate isolated crystals bis(cyclohexylammonium) salts.
