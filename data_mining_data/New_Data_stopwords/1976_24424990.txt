 Intact chloroplasts capable high rates CO2 assimilation completely oxidized 3-phosphoglycerate dihydroxyacetone phosphate glycolate CO2 concentrations low. Bicarbonate converted first products Calvin cycle glycolate. high oxygen high pH values CO2 fixation glycolate formation ceased bicarbonate exhausted. interpreted consequence depletion ribulose diphosphate (RuDP) oxygen compensation point, oxygen consumption glycolate formation oxygen evolution phosphoglycerate reduction balance other. Depletion RuDP glycolate formation proposed play role Warburg effect. maximum rate glycolate synthesis observed dihydroxyacetone phosphate substrate 35 mumol mg(-1) chlorophyll h(-1) 20 degrees C. may reflect maximum capacity chloroplasts glycolate synthesis. Dithiothreitol catalase, prevent accumulation oxygen radicals H2O2 carbon assimilation, increased glycolate formation. H2O2 inhibitory. inhibitors glycolate formation glyceraldehyde carbonylcyanide p-trifluoro-methoxphenylhydrazone. sensitivity glycolate synthesis uncoupling ATP requirement RuDP formation concluded glycolate originated RuDP. Different induction periods carbon fixation glycolyte formation suggested glycolate synthesis regulated ratio oxygen CO2 also another factor.
