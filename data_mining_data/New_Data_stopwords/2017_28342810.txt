 Cancer cells undergo major changes energy biosynthetic metabolism. One Warburg effect, pyruvate used fermentation rather oxidative phosphorylation. Another major one increased reliance glutamine, helps replenish pool Krebs cycle metabolites used purposes, amino acid lipid biosynthesis. Mitochondria central alterations, biochemical pathways linking processes run organelles. Two membranes, outer inner membrane, surround mitochondria, latter impermeable organic compounds. Therefore, large number transport proteins needed link biochemical pathways cytosol mitochondrial matrix. Since transport steps relatively slow, expected many transport steps altered cells become cancerous. review, changes expression regulation transport proteins discussed well role transported substrates. article part Special Issue entitled Mitochondria Cancer, edited Giuseppe Gasparre, Rodrigue Rossignol Pierre Sonveaux.
