 stated high expression pyruvate kinase (PKM2) emerges significant player metabolism progression various human malignancies. However, expression PKM2 association prognosis osteosarcoma yet studied. present study, expression biological significance PKM2 osteosarcoma investigated. found PKM2 expression elevated cancerous tissues abundant adjacent normal tissues (60.2 vs 26.1 %, p < 0.001). Moreover, showed high PKM2 expression positively correlated Enneking stage (p = 0.006) distant metastasis (p = 0.007) age, gender, tumor site, tumor size, histologic grade, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), local pain patients. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed overall survival (OS) patients high PKM2 expression significantly lower low PKM2 expression (p < 0.001). Finally, multivariate analysis revealed high PKM2 expression independent prognostic factor osteosarcoma patients (p = 0.004). Collectively, data indicated elevated PKM2 might serve novel target treatment osteosarcoma.
