 Trypanosoma rangeli hemoflagellate protist infects wild domestic mammals well humans Central South America. Although parasite pathogenic human, studied shares Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent Chagas' disease, biological characteristics, geographic distribution, vectors vertebrate hosts. Several metabolic studies performed T. cruzi epimastigotes, however little known metabolism T. rangeli. work present subcellular distribution T. rangeli enzymes responsible conversion glucose pyruvate, determined epifluorescense immunomicroscopy subcellular fractionation involving either selective membrane permeabilization digitonin differential isopycnic centrifugation. found T. rangeli epimastigotes first six enzymes glycolytic pathway, involved conversion glucose 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate located within glycosomes, last four steps occur cytosol. contrast T. cruzi, three isoenzymes (one cytosolic two glycosomal) phosphoglycerate kinase expressed simultaneously, one enzyme activity detected T. rangeli epimastigotes, cytosol. Consistent latter result, found enzymes involved auxiliary pathways glycolysis needed maintain adenine nucleotide redox balances within glycosomes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, pyruvate phosphate dikinase glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glucokinase, galactokinase first enzyme pentose-phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, also located inside glycosomes. Furthermore, demonstrate T. rangeli epimastigotes growing LIT medium consume glucose excrete ammonium; moreover, unable survive partially-depleted glucose medium. velocity glucose consumption 40% higher procyclic Trypanosoma brucei, four times faster T. cruzi epimastigotes culture conditions.
