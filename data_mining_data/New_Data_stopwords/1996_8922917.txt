 better characterize role skeletal muscle chronic heart failure studied energetic charge, metabolites enzyme activity energy production pathway. selected 15 males severe chronic heart failure (NYHA class III, stable clinical conditions normal nutritional status) seven controls. Controls patients submitted biopsy vastus lateralis muscle resting fasting conditions. Hormone profiles also evaluated. results showed near normal ATP, ADP AMP concentrations, substantially reductions glycogen (46 +/- 5 vs 77 +/- 6 mumoles glycosidic units.g-1 fresh tissue) creatine phosphate (5 +/- 1 vs 13 +/- 1 mumoles.g-1 fresh tissue) patients controls. also found reduction glycolytic activity (pyruvate kinase 1009 +/- 79 vs 1625 +/- 26 nmoles. min-1.mg protein-1), despite normal tricarboxylic acid cycle velocity, increase alanine amino-transferase (964 +/- 79 vs 425 +/- 34 nmoles. min-1.mg protein-1) aspartate aminotransferase (515 +/- 44 vs 291 +/- 56 nmoles.min-1.mg protein-1). increase also observed total NADH cytochrome c reductase (128 +/- 14 vs 68 +/- 5 nmoles.min-1.mg protein-1), cytochrome oxidase activity normal. cortisol/insulin ratio slightly elevated (77 +/- 4 vs 32 +/- 12). conclusion, normonutritive patients severe heart failure show imbalance energy production/utilization ratio. impairment probably due decrease production increase consumption energy owing greater cellular workload and/or hypercatabolic state.
