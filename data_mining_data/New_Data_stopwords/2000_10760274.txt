 Elevated glucose concentrations stimulate transcription pre-proinsulin (PPI), L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), genes islet beta cells. liver cells, pharmacological activation 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR) AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian homologue yeast SNF1 kinase complex, inhibits effects glucose, suggesting key signaling role kinase. Here, demonstrate AMPK activity inhibited elevated glucose concentrations MIN6 beta cells activation enzyme AICAR prevents activation L-PK gene elevated glucose. Furthermore, microinjection antibodies alpha2- (catalytic) beta2-subunits AMPK complex, alpha1-subunit extracellular stimulus-regulated kinase, mimics effects elevated glucose L-PK PPI promoter activities assessed single-cell imaging promoter luciferase constructs. case, injection antibodies nucleus cytosol, nucleus alone, necessary, indicating importance either cytosolic phosphorylation event subcellular localization alpha2-subunits. Incubation AICAR diminished, abolish, effect glucose PPI transcription. data suggest glucose-induced changes AMPK activity necessary sufficient regulation L-PK gene sugar also play important role regulation PPI promoter.
