 group reported significant association hexokinase II overexpression chemoresistance ovarian cancer, suggesting aerobic glycolysis so-called Warburg effect might contribute cancer progression. However, growing body evidence indicates contradictory findings regard Warburg effect, high mitochondrial activity highly invasive tumors low ATP contribution glycolysis ovarian cancer. solution dilemma Warburg effect, "reverse Warburg effect" proposed aerobic glycolysis might occur stromal compartment tumor rather cancer cells, indicating glycolytic tumor stroma feed cancer cells type symbiotic relationship. reverse Warburg effect acting relationship cancer cells cancer-associated fibroblasts evolved dynamic interplay cancer cells multiple tumor stromal compartments, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, adipocytes, tumor-associated macrophages. Peritoneal cavities including ascites omentum also form unique environment highly receptive carcinomatosis advanced stages ovarian cancer. complicated ingeniously orchestrated stroma-mediated cancer metabolism ovarian cancer provides great heterogeneity tumors chemoresistance, makes disease thus far difficult cure single stromal-targeting agents. review discuss experimental clinical evidence cross-talk cancer cells various components tumor stroma terms heterogeneous chemoresistance focal points therapeutic intervention ovarian cancer.
