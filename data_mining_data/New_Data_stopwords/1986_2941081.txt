 Neurospora crassa, single pyruvate kinase (PK) consisting four identical subunits approximately 60k daltons. Northern dot blot hybridization studies, using yeast pyruvate kinase gene probe, suggest presence two distinct mRNA species pyruvate kinase, separable basis length polyadenylated tails, oligo(dT)cellulose chromatography. messages present polysomes, immuno-precipitated anti-PK antibodies, indicating probable translation vivo. Fractions containing messages translated vitro heterologous systems well homologous N. crassa lysate, newly-synthesized PK detected immunoadsorption. Protection studies using S1-nuclease suggest major structural differences 5'-untranslated coding regions two messages.
