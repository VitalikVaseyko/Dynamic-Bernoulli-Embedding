 contrast normal differentiated cells depend mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation energy production, cancer cells evolved utilize aerobic glycolysis (Warburg's effect), benefit providing intermediates biomass production. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) highly expressed normal liver tissue regulating wide variety biological processes including cellular metabolism, reduced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression miR-122 shown inhibit cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, increase chemosensitivity, functions cancer metabolism remains unknown. present study aims identify miR-122 targeted genes investigate associated regulatory mechanisms HCC metabolism. found ectopic overexpression miR-122 affected metabolic activities HCC cells, evidenced reduced lactate production increased oxygen consumption. Integrated gene expression analysis cohort 94 HCC tissues revealed miR-122 level tightly associated battery glycolytic genes, pyruvate kinase (PK) gene showed strongest anti-correlation coefficient (Pearson r = -0.6938, p = <0.0001). addition, reduced PK level significantly associated poor clinical outcomes HCC patients. found isoform M2 (PKM2) dominant form highly expressed HCC direct target miR-122, overexpression miR-122 reduced mRNA protein levels PKM2, whereas PKM2 re-expression abrogated miR-122-mediated glycolytic activities. present study demonstrated regulatory role miR-122 PKM2 HCC, implication therapeutic intervention targeting cancer metabolic pathways.
