 One hallmarks cancer metabolic deregulation. Many tumors display increased glucose uptake breakdown process aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect. Less studied cancer development progression importance glutamine (Gln) pathway, provides cells variety essential products sustain cell proliferation, ATP macromolecules biosynthesis. end Gln dependency assessed panel non-small cell lung cancer lines (NSCLC). Gln found essential growth cells high rates glutaminolysis, exploring multiple genes Gln pathway, GLS1 found key enzyme associated dependence. dependence confirmed observing rescue decreased growth exogenous addition downstream metabolites glutaminolysis. Expression GLS1 splice variant KGA found decreased tumors compared normal lung tissue. Transient knock GLS1 splice variants indicated loss GAC detrimental effect cancer cell growth. conclusion, NSCLC cell lines depend Gln glutaminolysis varying degree, GLS1 splice variant GAC plays essential role potential target cancer metabolism-directed therapy.
