 Accumulating evidence suggests codeletion tumor suppressor genes Pten p53 plays crucial role development castration-resistant prostate cancer vivo. However, molecular mechanism underlying Pten-/p53-deficiency-driven prostate tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Building upon insights gained studies Pten-/p53-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), report hexokinase 2 (HK2) selectively upregulated combined loss Pten p53 prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, Pten deletion increases HK2 mRNA translation activation AKT-mTORC1-4EBP1 axis, p53 loss enhances HK2 mRNA stability inhibition miR143 biogenesis. Genetic studies demonstrate HK2-mediated aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect, required Pten-/p53-deficiency-driven tumor growth xenograft mouse models prostate cancer. findings suggest HK2 might therapeutic target prostate cancer patients carrying Pten p53 mutations.
