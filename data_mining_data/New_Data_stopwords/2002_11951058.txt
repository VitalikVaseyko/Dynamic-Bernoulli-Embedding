 BACKGROUND: Oligomers separate subunits glycolytic enzymes often different catalytic properties. However, spectral data show apparent lack significant conformational changes oligomerization. Since conformation enzyme determines catalytic properties, structural mechanism(s) influencing activity considerable interest. MATERIAL/METHODS: Analysis spatial structures junctions interglobular contacts binding sites may give clue mechanism(s) activation. work, problem studied using available structural biochemical data oligomeric enzymes glycolysis. RESULTS: Computational analysis structures junctions identified three structurally distinct types junctions: 1. interglobular binding site (2 8 enzymes); 2. domain-domain stabilization (5 8); 3. 'sequence overlap' local conformational change (all enzymes). Thus catalytic activity may influenced shifts modules protein structure (types 1, 2) and/or due slight change local structure (type 3). common junctions types 2 3 well conserved among eukaryotic enzymes, suggests biological importance. CONCLUSIONS: results suggest profound complex change conformation subunits oligomeric enzyme may necessary significant change catalytic properties. analysis maps residues important junctions thus link catalytic activity oligomeric state enzymes.
