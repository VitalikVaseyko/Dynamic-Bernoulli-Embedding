 increase carbon flux lysine, minimized production amino acids biosynthetically related lysine, example, isoleucine valine, required. limiting supply pantothenate, precursor coenzyme A, carbon flux redirected isoleucine valine lysine recombinant Corynebacterium lactofermentum ATCC 21799 containing plasmid pGC77. pGC77 contains hom(dr), thrB, ilvA encoding feedback-deregulated homoserine dehydrogenase, homoserine kinase, threonine dehydratase, respectively. 250 microM isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, recombinant (pGC77) produced lysine, valine, isoleucine. Limiting supply pantothenate 300 microg/l 30 microg/l resulted increase lysine (from 4.5 6.4 g/l) decreases valine (from 3.1 1.6 g/l) isoleucine (from 0.9 0.3 g/l) production. concentration pyruvate higher acetate lower pantothenate-limited culture control, suggesting limited supply pantothenate delayed conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA. Increased availability pyruvate limiting supply pantothenate might favor integration pyruvate lysine branch. results study useful production lysine decreased concentrations byproducts.
