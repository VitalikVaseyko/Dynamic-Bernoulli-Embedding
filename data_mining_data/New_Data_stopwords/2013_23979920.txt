 Many malignant human tumors, including melanomas, auxotrophic arginine due reduced expression argininosuccinate synthetase-1 (ASS1), rate-limiting enzyme arginine biosynthesis. Pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20), degrades extracellular arginine, resulting arginine deprivation, shown favorable results clinical trials treating arginine-auxotrophic tumors. Drug resistance major obstacle effective ADI-PEG20 usage. elucidate mechanisms resistance, established several ADI-PEG20-resistant (ADI(R)) variants A2058 SK-Mel-2 melanoma cells. Compared parental lines, ADI(R) variants showed following characteristics: (i) ADI(R) cell lines showed elevated ASS1 expression, resulting constitutive binding transcription factor c-Myc ASS1 promoter, suggesting elevated ASS1 major mechanism resistance; (ii) ADI(R) cell lines exhibited enhanced AKT signaling preferentially sensitive PI3K/AKT inhibitors, reduced mTOR signaling, preferentially resistant mTOR inhibitor; (iii) variants showed enhanced expression glucose transporter-1 lactate dehydrogenase-A, reduced expression pyruvate dehydrogenase, elevated sensitivity glycolytic inhibitors 2-deoxy-glucose 3-bromopyruvate, consistent enhanced glycolytic pathway (the Warburg effect); (iv) resistant cells showed higher glutamine dehydrogenase glutaminase expression preferentially vulnerable glutamine inhibitors. showed c-Myc, elevated ASS1 expression, involved upregulation many enzymes knockdown c-Myc reduced expression, whereas overexpressed ASS1 transfection reduced expression. study identified multiple targets overcoming ADI-PEG resistance cancer chemotherapy using recombinant arginine-degrading enzymes.
