 activity pyruvate kinase, subtype M2 (PKM2), known increased fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), one metabolites glycolytic pathway. Recently, shown vitro, Fru-1,6-P2 activated association monomer form tetrameric PKM2. ascertain whether mode regulation also occurs vivo, prepared monomer-specific monoclonal antibody quantified monomer formation situ cultured cells immunocytochemistry. intracellular Fru-1,6-P2 manipulated glucose concentration media. physiological concentration glucose (4-6 mM), 30-35% PK existed monomer. However, PKM2 dissociated monomer within minutes cells deprived glucose. maximal level monomer detected 1 h 37 degrees C. Monomer rapidly (within minutes) converted tetramer addition glucose. Furthermore, cells cultured 10 mM glucose treated cytochalasin B, inhibitor glucose transporter, maximal level monomer detected within 20-30 min. Determination Fru-1,6-P2 indicated intracellular concentration decreased concomitantly reduction glucose concentration medium. results indicate monomer-tetramer inter-conversion major vivo cellular regulatory mechanism response changes extracellular glucose concentration via Fru-1,6-P2.
