 Obesity key risk factor development insulin resistance (IR). study investigate IR attenuating effect molecular mechanism cis-9,trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11-CLA). study performed palmitate-induced IR model using C(2)C(12) myotubes showed c9,t11-CLA increased insulin-stimulated basal (non-insulin-stimulated) glucose uptake IR myotubes. c9,t11-CLA also up-regulated levels phosphorglycogen synthase, phosphoracetyl CoA carboxylase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 down-regulating level pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 insulin-stimulated basal conditions. However, c9,t11-CLA affect protein kinase B/Akt (Akt). results suggested c9,t11-CLA induced insulin-independent enhancement glucose fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, dose- time-dependent increase expression phosphor-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), whereas LKB1, upstream kinase AMPK, unchanged. Collectively, c9,t11-CLA attenuated palmitate-induced IR increasing consumption glucose fatty acid, mechanism involving direct activation AMPK.
