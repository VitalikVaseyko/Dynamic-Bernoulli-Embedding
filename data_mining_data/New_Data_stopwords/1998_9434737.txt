 crystal structure rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase complexed Mn2+, K+, pyruvate revealed binding site K+ [T. M. Larsen, L. T. Laughlin, H. M. Holden, I. Rayment, G. H. Reed (1994) Biochemistry 33, 6301-6309]. Sequence comparisons rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase pyruvate kinases Corynebacterium glutamicum Escherichia coli, exhibit requirement activation monovalent cations, indicate substitutions K+ binding site conservative. Glu 117 rabbit muscle enzyme, close K+ site, is, however, replaced Lys two bacterial pyruvate kinases. proximity Glu 117 K+ structure rabbit enzyme conservation binding site bacterial enzymes lack dependence monovalent cations suggested protonated epsilon-amino group Lys 117 bacterial enzymes may provide "internal monovalent cation." Site-specific mutant forms rabbit enzyme corresponding E117K, E117A, E117D, E117K/K114Q pyruvate kinase examined test hypothesis. E117K pyruvate kinase exhibits 12% activity fully activated wild-type enzyme > 200-fold active wild-type enzyme absence activating monovalent cations. Moreover, activity E117K pyruvate kinase exhibits stimulation monovalent cations assay mixtures. E117A E117D pyruvate kinases retain activation monovalent cations reduced activities relative wild type. results consistent hypothesis pyruvate kinases require activation monovalent cations supply internal monovalent cation form protonated epsilon-amino group Lys. results also support assignment monovalent cation active site pyruvate kinase.
