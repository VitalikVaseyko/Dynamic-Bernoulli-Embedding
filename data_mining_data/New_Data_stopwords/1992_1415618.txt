 Intracellular pH (pHi), intracellular free magnesium concentration ([Mg2+]i), high-energy phosphates Langendorff perfused rat hearts evaluated 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolic acidosis. acidosis, cardiac pHi approached perfusing solution (pH approximately 6.7) [Mg2+]i increased. hearts perfused glucose sole carbon source, ratio [phosphocreatine] [ATP] decreased acidosis. contrast, hearts supplemented pyruvate (either 2.8 10 mM) ratio increased acidosis. Oxygen consumption decreased hearts perfused glucose pyruvate-glucose. Using creatine kinase equilibrium constant, find [MgADP] significantly decreased pyruvate-perfused hearts significantly altered glucose-perfused hearts metabolic acidosis. data indicate [MgADP] may regulator cardiac oxidative phosphorylation presence excess pyruvate; however, metabolic acidosis hearts perfused glucose only, ATP synthesis appears limited availability pyruvate via glycolysis.
