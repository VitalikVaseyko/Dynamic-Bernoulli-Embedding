 BACKGROUND: Ketone bodies metabolic epigenetic roles cancer. several studies, showed anti-cancer effect via inhibition histone deacetylases; however, studies observed faster tumour growth. related molecule butyrate also inhibits growth cancer cells accelerates others. "butyrate paradox" thought due butyrate mediating histone acetylation thus inhibiting cell proliferation cancers preferentially utilise glucose (the Warburg effect); whereas cells oxidise butyrate fuel, fails reach inhibitory concentrations stimulate growth. METHODS: treated transgenic mice bearing spontaneous MMTV-NEU-NT mammary tumours ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) monitored tumour growth, metabolite concentrations histone acetylation. cell line derived tumours, also measured uptake beta-OHB glucose, lactate production, absence presence beta-OHB. RESULTS: beta-OHB administration accelerated growth MMTV-NEU-NT tumours, metabolic profile showed significant increases ATP, glutamine, serine choline-related metabolites. beta-OHB concentration within treated tumours, 0.46 +/- 0.05 mumol/g, effect histone acetylation shown western blots. Cultured tumour cells incubated 0.5 mM beta-OHB showed beta-OHB uptake would equivalent 54% glycolytic ATP phosphorylation significant change glucose consumption lactate production. CONCLUSIONS: results suggest beta-OHB paradox may occur mammary tumours manner analogous butyrate paradox. low beta-OHB concentrations (<1 mM, observed tumour model post-treatment), absence Warburg effect, beta-OHB consumed thus acts oxidative energy source epigenetic factor. would explain increase tumour growth treatment, metabolic profiles absence effect histone H3 acetylation.
