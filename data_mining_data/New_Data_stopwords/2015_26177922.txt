 Neuroblastoma one common solid tumors childhood usually accompanied poor prognosis rapid tumor progression diagnosed amplification proto-oncogene N-Myc. amplification N-Myc major influence maintenance aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect. specific switch conversion pyruvate lactate instead conversion pyruvate acetyl-coenzyme even presence oxygen important benefits tumor, e.g. increased production enzymes enzyme substrates involved tumor progression, angiogenesis inhibition apoptosis. antiprotozoal drug nifurtimox, generally used treatment infections parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, reported cytotoxic properties therapy neuroblastoma. However, action mechanism described detail yet. presented vitro study neuroblastoma cell lines LA-N-1, IMR-32, LS SK-N-SH shows increased production oxidative stress, reduced lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activity reduced lactate production nifurtimox treatment. Furthermore, nifurtimox leads reduced mRNA protein levels proto-oncogene protein N-Myc. Thus, current work gives new insights effect nifurtimox tumor metabolism revealing shifted glucose metabolism production lactate oxidative phosphorylation reduced expression major molecular prognostic factor neuroblastoma N-Myc, presenting nifurtimox possible adjuvant therapeutic agent (high risk) neuroblastoma.
