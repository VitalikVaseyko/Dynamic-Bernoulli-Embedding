 Ingestion ammonium containing diet produces hyperammonemia protects rats acute ammonium intoxication. Acute ammonium toxicity attributed depletion energy metabolite intermediates. show hyperammonemia affords considerable protection depletion hepatic energy metabolites evoked ammonium acetate injection. control rats marked decreases content acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, ATP, 2-oxoglutarate, lactate, pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate increased markedly. hyperammonemic rats beta-hydroxybutyrate, ATP, 2-oxoglutarate, lactate significantly affected pyruvate increased markedly phosphoenolpyruvate slightly. results suggest controls activity pyruvate kinase inhibited ammonium injection hyperammonemic rats inhibited. content alanine (an inhibitor pyruvate kinase) reached 2.8 mumol/g controls 1.6 mumol/g hyperammonemic rats, 15 min ammonium injection. could explain different effects ammonium injection control hyperammonemic rats.
