 Previous studies suggested glycolytic intermediates involved regulation L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression carbohydrates glucose fructose. find intermediates, examined relationship levels L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA glycolytic metabolites hepatocytes cultured various conditions. metabolites, levels 3-phosphoglycerate phosphoenol-pyruvate increased significantly conditions expression L-type pyruvate kinase gene stimulated. level glucose 6-phosphate, reported involved dietary stimulation gene expression, correlated mRNA level since marked accumulation deoxyglucose 6-phosphate occurring addition deoxyglucose, nonmetabolizable glucose analog, accompanied increase L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA level. addition, found fructose low concentration presence glucose failed increase mRNA metabolite levels contrast reports promoter activity L-type pyruvate kinase gene stimulated treatment. Thus propose 3-phosphoglycerate and/or phosphoenolpyruvate involved carbohydrate regulation L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression.
