 OBJECTIVE: aimed verify evidence consider dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) reverts metabolic shift cancer cells glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation, promising drug therapy cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: assessed expression profile PDK 1, 2 3 series melanoma samples, verify melanoma tumors express DCA targets, expression correlates activation important signaling cascades melanomagenesis also prognosis melanoma patients. also established sensitivity melanoma cell lines DCA treatment, assessing metabolic alterations, proliferation survival. RESULTS: observed PDK 1 2 isoforms overexpressed CM compared nevi, expression associated expression mTOR pathway effectors independent BRAF mutational status. Melanoma cell lines treated DCA showed shift metabolism, is, decrease glucose consumption lactate production, downregulation proliferation, increase apoptosis decrease mTOR pathway activation. CONCLUSION: results suggest PDK expression may play role melanoma development DCA useful CM therapy, alone combination mTOR inhibitors.
