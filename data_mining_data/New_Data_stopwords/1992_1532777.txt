 Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) results imbalance insulin sensitivity insulin secretion. longitudinal cross-sectional studies demonstrated earliest detectable abnormality NIDDM impairment body's ability respond insulin. pancreas able appropriately augment secretion insulin offset insulin resistance, glucose tolerance remains normal. time, however, beta-cell fails maintain high rate insulin secretion relative insulinopenia (i.e., relative degree insulin resistance) leads development impaired glucose tolerance eventually overt diabetes mellitus. cause pancreatic "exhaustion" remains unknown may related effect glucose toxicity genetically predisposed beta-cell. Information concerning loss first-phase insulin secretion, altered pulsatility insulin release, enhanced proinsulin-insulin secretory ratio discussed pertains altered beta-cell function NIDDM. Insulin resistance NIDDM involves hepatic peripheral, muscle, tissues. postabsorptive state hepatic glucose output normal increased, despite presence fasting hyperinsulinemia, whereas efficiency tissue glucose uptake reduced. response endogenously secreted exogenously administered insulin, hepatic glucose production fails suppress normally muscle glucose uptake diminished. accelerated rate hepatic glucose output due entirely augmented gluconeogenesis. muscle many cellular defects insulin action described including impaired insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, diminished glucose transport, reduced glycogen synthase pyruvate dehydrogenase. abnormalities account disturbances two major intracellular pathways glucose disposal, glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation. earliest stages NIDDM, major defect involves inability insulin promote glucose uptake storage glycogen. potential mechanisms put forward explain insulin resistance, include increased lipid oxidation, altered skeletal muscle capillary density/fiber type/blood flow, impaired insulin transport across vascular endothelium, increased amylin, calcitonin gene-related peptide levels, glucose toxicity.
