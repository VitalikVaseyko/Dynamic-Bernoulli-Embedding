 Metabolomics proven useful tool systems biology. used metabolomics approach identify conditions de novo expression established tumor marker, galectin-3, would confer potential selective advantage melanoma growth survival. murine melanoma cell line (Tm1) lacks galectin-3 modified express (Tm1.G2 Tm1.N3, respectively). variant cell line exposed conditions controlled oxygen tensions glucose levels. Metabolic profiling intracellular metabolites cells exposed conditions obtained steady state using high resolution (1)H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) multivariate statistical analysis. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra contained large number absorption lines able distinguish 20 metabolites, 3 fatty acids absorption lines clusters identified. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) allowed discrimination 2 experimental conditions expression tumor marker galectin-3 may play significant role, namely exposure cells hypoxia high glucose. Interestingly, experimental conditions tested, cellular system quite robust. results suggest Metabolomics approach used access information changes many metabolic pathways induced tumorigenic cells allow evaluation behavior controlled environmental conditions selective pressures.
