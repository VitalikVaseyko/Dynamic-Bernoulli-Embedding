 modulation protein kinase activities low molecular weight compounds major goal current pharmaceutical developments. line, important efforts directed development drugs targeting conserved ATP binding site. However, little experience targeting allosteric, regulatory sites, different ATP binding site, protein kinases. describe synthesis, cell-free activation potency, calorimetric binding analysis 3,5-diphenylpent-2-enoic acids derivatives allosteric modulators phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) catalytic activity. SAR results combined thermodynamic binding analyses revealed favorable binding enthalpy entropy confirmed PIF-binding pocket PDK1 druggable site. conclusion, defined minimal structural requirements compounds bind PIF-binding pocket act allosteric modulators identified two new lead structures (12Z 13Z) predominating binding enthalpy.
