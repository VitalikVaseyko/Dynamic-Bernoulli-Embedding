 PURPOSE REVIEW: review describes mechanisms neutrophils contribute angiogenesis hypoxic tissues different conditions diseases (e.g., menstrual cycle, wound healing, ischemic diseases, cancers), particular focus recently described proangiogenic neutrophil subpopulation. RECENT FINDINGS: importance neutrophils initiation angiogenesis described past decade, believed occur release well-known proangiogenic factors Bv8, vascular endothelial growth factor A, matrix metalloproteinase 9. However, additional proangiogenic actions neutrophils outlined year, mediated example pyruvate kinase M2, 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, formation neutrophil extracellular traps, although distinct mechanisms action remain partly unknown. Neutrophils also limit angiogenesis secreting example neutrophil elastase alpha-defensins, generate angiostatic molecules proteolytically inactivate proangiogenic factors, respectively. opposing neutrophil actions consequence on-site education recruitment distinct subpopulations circulation. Indeed, circulating proangiogenic neutrophil subpopulation recently described mice men, rapidly recruited hypoxic tissues vascular endothelial growth factor A. SUMMARY: recent findings highlighted diversity actions performed neutrophils angiogenic process identified new opportunities regulate angiogenesis.
