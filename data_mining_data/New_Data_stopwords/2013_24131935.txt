 Cancer metastasis major cause cancer-associated death. Accordingly, identification regulatory mechanisms control whether tumor cells become "directed walkers" crucial issue cancer research. deregulation cell migration cancer progression determines capacity tumor cells escape primary tumors invade adjacent tissues finally form metastases. ability switch predominantly oxidative metabolism glycolysis production lactate even oxygen plentiful key characteristic cancer cells. metabolic switch, known Warburg effect, first described 1920s, affected tumor cell growth also tumor cell migration. review, focus recent studies cancer cell metabolism affects tumor cell migration invasion. Understanding new aspects molecular mechanisms signaling pathways controlling tumor cell migration critical development therapeutic strategies cancer patients.
