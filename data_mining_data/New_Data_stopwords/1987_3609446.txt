 chickens, existence liver form pyruvate kinase controversial, liver form pyruvate kinase pheasants, murres puffins electrophoretically distinct muscle, brain, kidney, lung small intestine. Although forms lungs, muscle, heart, brain small intestine could reliably separated electrophoresis, functional characteristics lung muscle forms pyruvate kinase pheasant distinct classified K isozymes respectively. data suggest birds possess least three distinct isozymes pyruvate kinase.
