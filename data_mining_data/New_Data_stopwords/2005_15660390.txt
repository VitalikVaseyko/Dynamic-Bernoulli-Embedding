 liver regenerates acute injury via hepatocyte cell division; chronic injury, hepatocyte replication impaired blocked, liver progenitor oval cells mediate liver regeneration. regeneration options blocked animal models, liver failure death ensues. mechanisms underlying oval cell induction, proliferation, subsequent liver regeneration remain poorly characterized. particular, cell-signaling pathways distinguish alternative pathways unknown. study shows mouse model, hepatic expression lymphotoxin-beta (LTbeta) interferon gamma (IFNgamma) transcripts increased response choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet, induces oval cell-mediated liver regeneration. Oval cells express LTbeta IFNgamma transcripts, contributing increased expression liver mice fed CDE diet. attenuated oval cell response diet observed LTbeta receptor-, LTbeta-, IFNgamma-gene targeted mice. Loss LTbeta LTbeta receptor signaling reduced number oval cells expressing A6 muscle pyruvate kinase. lack IFNgamma signaling reduced muscle pyruvate kinase(+), A6(+), oval cells. contrast, partial hepatectomy suppressed LTbeta IFNgamma transcripts. also show IFNgamma induces STAT-3 phosphorylation oval cell line. conclusion, LTbeta, LTbeta receptor, IFNgamma involved oval cell-mediated, hepatocyte-mediated, liver regeneration, absence pathways impairs oval cell-dependent regenerative response.
