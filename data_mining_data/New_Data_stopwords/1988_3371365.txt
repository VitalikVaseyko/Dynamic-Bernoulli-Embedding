 Perchloric acid extracts rabbit renal proximal convoluted tubular cells (PCT) incubated [2-13C]glycerol [1,3-13C]glycerol investigated 13C-NMR spectroscopy. 13C-NMR spectra enabled us determine cell metabolic pathways glycerol PCT cells. main percentage 13C-label, arising 13C-enriched glycerol, found glucose, lactate, glutamine glutamate. far concluded glycerol suitable substrate PCT cells involved gluconeogenesis glycolysis well Krebs cycle intermediates. Label exchange label enrichment 13C-labelled glucose, arising [2-13C]glycerol [1,3-13C]glycerol, explained label scrambling pentose shunt label exchange triose phosphate pool. relative enrichments estimated ratio pyruvate kinase flux gluconeogenetic flux 0.97:1 ratio pyruvate carboxylase activity relative pyruvate dehydrogenase activity 2.0:1. results show 13C-NMR spectroscopy, using 13C-labelled substrates, powerful tool examination renal metabolism.
