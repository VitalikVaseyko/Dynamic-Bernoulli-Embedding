 applied combined proteomic metabolomic approach obtain novel mechanistic insights PKCvarepsilon-mediated cardioprotection. Mitochondrial cytosolic proteins control transgenic hearts constitutively active dominant negative PKCvarepsilon analyzed using difference in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE). Among differentially expressed proteins creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cytosolic isoforms aspartate amino transferase malate dehydrogenase, two enzymatic components malate aspartate shuttle, required import reducing equivalents glycolysis across inner mitochondrial membrane. enzymatic changes appeared dependent PKCvarepsilon activity, observed mice expressing inactive PKCvarepsilon. High-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy confirmed pronounced effect PKCvarepsilon activity cardiac glucose energy metabolism: normoxic hearts constitutively active PKCvarepsilon significantly lower concentrations glucose, lactate, glutamine creatine, higher levels choline, glutamate total adenosine nucleotides. Moreover, depletion cardiac energy metabolites slower ischemia/reperfusion injury glucose metabolism recovered faster upon reperfusion transgenic hearts active PKCvarepsilon. Notably, inhibition PKCvarepsilon resulted compensatory phosphorylation mitochondrial translocation PKCdelta. Taken together, findings first evidence PKCvarepsilon activity modulates cardiac glucose metabolism provide possible explanation synergistic effect PKCdelta PKCvarepsilon cardioprotection.
