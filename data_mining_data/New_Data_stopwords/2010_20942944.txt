 BACKGROUND: Proliferation oval cells, bipotent precursor cells liver, requires impeded proliferation loss hepatocytes well specific micro-environment, provided adjacent sinusoidal cells liver. Despite immense importance triggering oval cell response, cells hepatic sinusoids rarely investigated. elucidate response sinusoidal liver cells employed choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet, common method inducing oval cell response rodent liver. utilised selected expression markers commonly used past phenotypic discrimination oval cells sinusoidal cells: cytokeratin, E-cadherin M2-pyruvate kinase oval cells; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) used hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). RESULTS: CDE diet leads activation cells hepatic sinusoid mouse liver. Beside oval cells, also HSCs Kupffer cells proliferate. entire fraction proliferating cells mouse liver well endothelial cells cholangiocytes express M2-pyruvate kinase. Concomitantly, GFAP, long considered unique marker quiescent HSCs upregulated activated HSCs expressed also cholangiocytes oval cells. CONCLUSIONS: results point important role types sinusoidal cells regeneration CDE induced liver damage call utmost caution using traditional marker identifying specific cell types. Thus, M2-pyruvate kinase longer used estimating oval cell response mouse liver. CDE diet leads activation GFAP positive HSCs pericentral zone liver lobulus. periportal zone detection GFAP biliary cells oval cells, calls cell types progenitors hepatocytes question CDE diet conditions.
