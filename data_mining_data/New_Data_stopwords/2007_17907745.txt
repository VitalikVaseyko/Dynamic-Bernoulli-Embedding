 view clarify induction "Crabtree consequence" liver cells S. mansoni infected mice, curative effect oil extract C. longa tested compared praziquantel (PZQ) effective drug schistosome species occurring man. Protein, glucose, glucose-6-phopsphatase, AMP-deaminase, adensoine deaminase, urea concentration, pyravate kinase (PK), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) PK/PEPCK ratio estimated. addition, worm burden ova count mice infected S. mansoni elucidated. result showed C. longa normalized concentration protein, glucose, AMP-deaminase adenosine deaminase, changed infection. Moreover, lowered pyruvate kinase level, PZQ-treatment induced elevation enzyme. PZQ effective lowering worm burden C. longa extract potent reducing egg count.
