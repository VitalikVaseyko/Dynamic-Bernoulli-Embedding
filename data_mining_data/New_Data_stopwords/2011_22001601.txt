 Recent developments cancer research led reconsiderations regarding metabolic dysfunctions cancer cell proliferation differentiation. original concept stemmed observation that, even presence oxygen, highly proliferating cells tend generate energy strictly glycolytic pathway, process called aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect. recently, advances field metabolomics applied cancer research enabled documenting generality Warburg effect broad variety tumors. metabolomics, cancer cells told us oxidative stress, representing one leading cause genetic instability underpinning carcinogenesis, could also deliver window probable therapeutic opportunities worth opening.
