 Warburg Micro syndrome Martsolf syndrome heterogenous autosomal-recessive developmental disorders characterized brain, eye, endocrine abnormalities. Previously, identification mutations RAB3GAP1 RAB3GAP2 syndromes implicated dysregulation RAB3 cycle (which controls calcium-mediated exocytosis neurotransmitters hormones) disease pathogenesis. RAB3GAP1 RAB3GAP2 encode catalytic noncatalytic subunits hetrodimeric enzyme RAB3GAP (RAB3GTPase-activating protein), key regulator RAB3 cycle. performed autozygosity mapping five consanguineous families without RAB3GAP1/2 mutations identified loss-of-function mutations RAB18. c.71T > (p.Leu24Gln) founder mutation identified four Pakistani families, homozygous exon 2 deletion (predicted result frameshift) found fifth family. single family whose members compound heterozygotes anti-termination mutation stop codon c.619T > C (p.X207QextX20) inframe arginine deletion c.277_279 del (p.Arg93 del) identified direct gene sequencing multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) 58 families. Nucleotide binding assays RAB18(Leu24Gln) RAB18(Arg93del) showed mutant proteins functionally null unable bind guanine. clinical features Warburg Micro syndrome patients RAB3GAP1 RAB3GAP2 mutations RAB18 mutations indistinguishable, although role RAB18 trafficking still emerging, linked previously RAB3 pathway. Knockdown rab18 zebrafish suggests might conserved developmental role. findings imply RAB18 critical role human brain eye development neurodegeneration.
