 Background & Aims: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated oxidative stress. surmised pharmacologic activation NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) using acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyano enone) TBE-31 would suppress NASH Nrf2 transcriptional master regulator intracellular redox homeostasis. Methods: Nrf2(+/+) Nrf2(-/-) C57BL/6 mice fed high-fat plus fructose (HFFr) regular chow diet 16 weeks 30 weeks, treated final 6 weeks, still fed HFFr regular chow diets, either TBE-31 dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle control. Measures whole-body glucose homeostasis, histologic assessment liver, biochemical molecular measurements steatosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress performed livers animals. Results: TBE-31 treatment reversed insulin resistance HFFr-fed wild-type mice, HFFr-fed Nrf2-null mice. TBE-31 treatment HFFr-fed wild-type mice substantially decreased liver steatosis expression lipid synthesis genes, increasing hepatic expression fatty acid oxidation lipoprotein assembly genes. Also, TBE-31 treatment decreased ER stress, expression inflammation genes, markers apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress livers HFFr-fed wild-type mice. comparison, TBE-31 decrease steatosis, ER stress, lipogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress livers HFFr-fed Nrf2-null mice. Conclusions: Pharmacologic activation Nrf2 mice already rendered obese insulin resistant reversed insulin resistance, suppressed hepatic steatosis, mitigated NASH liver fibrosis, effects principally attribute inhibition ER, inflammatory, oxidative stress.
