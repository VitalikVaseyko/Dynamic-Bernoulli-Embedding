 Warburg effect plays critical role tumorigenesis, suggesting specific agents targeting Warburg effect key proteins may promising strategy cancer therapy. Previous studies shown diallyl trisulfide (DATS) inhibits proliferation breast cancer cells inducing apoptosis vitro vivo. However, whether Warburg effect involved apoptosis-promoting action DATS unclear. Here, show action DATS associated downregulation lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), essential protein Warburg effect whose upregulation closely related tumorigenesis. Interestingly, inhibition Warburg effect DATS breast cancer cells greatly affect normal cells. Furthermore, DATS inhibited growth breast cancer cells, particularly MDA-MB-231, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell, reduced proliferation migration; invasion reversed over-expression LDHA. data suggest DATS inhibits breast cancer growth aggressiveness novel pathway targeting key enzyme Warburg effect. study shows LDHA downregulation involved apoptotic effect DATS TNBC.
