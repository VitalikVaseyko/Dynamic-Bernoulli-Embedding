 AIM: Malignant tumours ferment glucose lactate even presence sufficient oxygen (the Warburg effect). Transketolases seem involved metabolic switch. TKTL1 previously shown encode transketolase-like enzyme overexpressed colon, urothelial breast cancer. investigated prognostic impact TKTL1 expression non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Curatively operated NSCLCs 201 patients analysed TKTL1 expression immunohistochemistry (clone JFC12T10). Statistical analyses regard clinicopathological parameters included Kaplan-Meier multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: mild TKTL1 expression 89 tumours (44.7%), whereas 110 tumours (55.3%) TKTL1 overexpressed. TKTL1 overexpression correlated tumour-type (p = 0.02) histological grading (p = 0.033) significantly associated poor patient survival (p = 0.008). addition, TKTL1 overexpression identified patients poor clinical outcome among lymph node negative (p = 0.039) well moderately differentiated (p = 0.005) NSCLCs; furthermore, proved independent prognostic factor (p = 0.0252). CONCLUSION: data suggest TKTL1 overexpression new independent predictor survival patients NSCLC. Since inhibition transketolase enzyme reactions recently shown effectively suppress tumour growth, TKTL1 represents novel pharmacodiagnostic marker.
