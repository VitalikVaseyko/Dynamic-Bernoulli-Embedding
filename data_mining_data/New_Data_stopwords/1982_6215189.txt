 enzyme activities isozyme distribution three glycolytic regulator enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase studied lymphocytes patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Isozyme distribution patterns determined kinetic measurements, electrophoresis immunoprecipitation. CLL lymphocytes different normal non-T lymphocytes respect hexokinase residual activity presence glucose-1,6-P2, pyruvate kinase residual activity presence alanine, phosphofructokinase activity stimulation glucose-1,6-P2. differences could discerned enzyme activities CLL normal non-T lymphocytes.
