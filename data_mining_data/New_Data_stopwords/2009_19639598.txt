 Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway increasingly implicated liver development physiology. Aberrant activation pathway one major genetic events observed process human HCC development. gain insight mechanism underlying beta-catenin action liver, conducted quantitative differential proteomic analysis using 2-D DIGE combined MS, mice liver-specific deletion Apc resulting acute activation beta-catenin signaling (Apc(KOliv) mice). identified 94 protein spots showing differential expression mutant Apc(KOliv) control mice, corresponding 56 individual proteins. proteins identified associated metabolic pathways, ammonia glucose metabolism. analysis showed increase lactate dehydrogenase activity together downregulation two mitochondrial ATPase subunits (ATP5a1 ATP5b). observations indicate beta-catenin signaling may induce shift glucose metabolism oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, known "Warburg effect". Imaging (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography suggests specific metabolic reprogramming induced beta-catenin liver imply first step glycolysis. observation may explain HCCs difficult assess fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography imaging.
