 modified adenine nucleotides ATP-NO, ADP-NO, AMP-NO tested potential substrates and/or inhibitors mitochondrial phosphotransferases. ADP-NO recognized translocase system located inner mitochondrial membrane; however, rapidly phosphorylated ATP-NO outer compartment mitochondria, way nucleosidediphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) reaction, provided sufficient ATP mitochondria. AMP-NO phosphorylated liver mitochondria corresponding nucleoside diphosphate; cannot serve substrate adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3). ATP-NO ADP-NO, however, substrates enzyme. apparent equilibrium constant reaction, ADP-NO + ADP right harpoon left harpoon ATP-NO + AMP, 0.908 pH 7.4 5 mM Mg(2+) significantly higher reaction natural nucleotides. Although adenosine N(1)-oxide easily phosphorylated AMP-NO adenosine kinase [Schnebli et al. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 1997-2004], formation corresponding nucleoside triphosphate vivo seems also limited adenylate kinase; adenosine N(1)-oxide cannot replace adenosine restoring normal ATP level ethionine-treated rats.
