 Pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32) essential regulatory enzymes glucose oxidation helminths, PK/PEPCK branch point first divergent step carbohydrate catabolism parasites hosts. Recently, PEPCK cestode parasite, Raillietina echinobothrida, purified characterized. order find differential kinetics, any, PK/PEPCK branch point parasite, study, purified characterized parasite PK compared parasite PEPCK. purified PK displayed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics Kmapp 77.8 microM substrate PEP, whereas Kmapp 46.9 microM PEPCK. PEP exhibited differential kinetics PK/PEPCK branch point parasite behaved homotropic effector PEPCK, PK. inhibitory constant (Ki) genistein daidzein (phytochemicals Flemingia vestita) determined discussed. results, hypothesize PK/PEPCK branch point probable site anthelmintic action.
