 nuclear receptor peroxisome-proliferation-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), transcriptional master regulator glucose lipid metabolism, inhibits growth several common cancers, including lung cancer. study, show mechanism activation PPARgamma inhibits proliferation lung cancer cells based metabolic changes. found treatment PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone triggers metabolic switch inhibits pyruvate oxidation reduces glutathione levels. PPARgamma-induced metabolic changes result marked increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels lead rapid hypophosphorylation retinoblastoma protein (RB) cell-cycle arrest. antiproliferative effect PPARgamma activation prevented suppressing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) beta-oxidation fatty acids vitro vivo. proposed mechanism also suggests metabolic changes rapidly directly inhibit cell-cycle progression cancer cells altering ROS levels.
