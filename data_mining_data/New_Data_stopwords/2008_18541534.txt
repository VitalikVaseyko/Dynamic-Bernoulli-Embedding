 High lactate generation low glucose oxidation, despite normal oxygen conditions, commonly seen cancer cells tumors. Historically known Warburg effect, altered metabolic phenotype long correlated malignant progression poor clinical outcome. However, mechanistic relationship altered glucose metabolism malignancy remains poorly understood. show inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity contributes Warburg metabolic malignant phenotype human head neck squamous cell carcinoma. PDC inhibition occurs via enhanced expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), results inhibitory phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha (PDHalpha) subunit. also demonstrate PDC inhibition cancer cells associated normoxic stabilization malignancy-promoting transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) glycolytic metabolites. Knockdown PDK-1 via short hairpin RNA lowers PDHalpha phosphorylation, restores PDC activity, reverts Warburg metabolic phenotype, decreases normoxic HIF-1alpha expression, lowers hypoxic cell survival, decreases invasiveness, inhibits tumor growth. PDK-1 HIF-1-regulated gene, data suggest buildup glycolytic metabolites, resulting high PDK-1 expression, may turn promote HIF-1 activation, thus sustaining feed-forward loop malignant progression. addition providing anabolic support cancer cells, altered fuel metabolism thus supports malignant phenotype. Correction metabolic abnormalities offers unique opportunities cancer treatment may potentially synergize cancer therapies.
