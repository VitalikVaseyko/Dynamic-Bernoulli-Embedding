 N6-O- p-fluorobenzoyladenosine 5'-triphosphates (IIIc IIc, respectively) synthesized potential adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) site-directed reagents enzymes. IIc IIIc substrates yeast hexokinase; neither corresponding ADP derivatives inactivated yeast hexokinase rabbit pyruvate kinase. IIc rapidly inactivated rabbit carp muscle adenylate kinases; effect probably ATP site directed N6-benzoyl-ATP inactivate substrate (Vmax = 28 10%, respectively, ATP), ATP retarded inactivation. inactivations followed pseudo-firsr-order kinetics; presence 2.64 mM ATP 0 degrees half-life rabbit kinase 210 min 50 muM IIc half-life carp kinase 130 min 100 muM IIc. Adenylate kinase pig muscle inactivated IIc manner similar rabbit carp enzymes except rate inactivation exhibited inflexion. IIIc inactivated rabbit, pig, carp adenylate kinases pseudo-first-order kinetics; rate constants inactivation 0 degrees 9.1 X 10(-3), 1.3 X 10(-3), 1.9 X 10(-3) min-1 apparent dissociation constants (K) IIIc-enzyme complexes 710, 970, 720 muM, respectively. substrate properties IIIc alone admixture ATP dissociation constants (Ki) ATP sites enzymes found 500, 700, 845 muM, respectively. similarity K Ki values, together marked retardation inactivations ATP, indicates IIIc ATP-site-directed reagent three adenylate kinases.
