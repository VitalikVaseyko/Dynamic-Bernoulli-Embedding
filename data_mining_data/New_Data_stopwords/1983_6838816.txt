 Phosphoenolpyruvate heated acidic solution exchanges phosphoryl carboxyl oxygens rapidly enolic oxygen much slowly oxygens water. incorporation 18O phosphoenolpyruvate measured gas chromatography-mass spectrometry phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance heating H218O 98 degrees C. rates exchange six oxygens phosphoenolpyruvate water increase increasing acidity, phosphoryl oxygens exchange rapidly carboxyl oxygens. rate exchange oxygen phosphoryl group 16-fold greater hydrolysis rate 1 N HCl. provides simple useful method synthesis [18O]phosphoenolpyruvate highly enriched phosphoryl-group oxygens. enrichment 89% obtained 50% yield. [18O]-phosphoenolpyruvate showed binomial distribution 18O phosphoryl-group oxygens. exchange may explained reversible formation transient cyclic phosphate and, exchange enolic oxygen, transient acyl phosphate. Preparation [18O]phosphoenolypyruvate [18O]Pi chemical synthesis beta-chlorolactate satisfactory drastic loss 18O procedures used. loss 18O also occurred enzymic synthesis KCNO, [18O]Pi, carbamate kinase, pyruvate kinase.
