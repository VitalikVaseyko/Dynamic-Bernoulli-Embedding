 53 basepair deletion constructed within 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) yeast pyruvate kinase (PYK) gene borne upon centromeric plasmid. Various modular assemblies pUC13 polylinker DNA (single unit = 44 bp) used replace deleted region, effects modifications upon transcript stability translation ascertained yeast. use differential probing stratagem, based hybridisation specific oligonucleotides either pUC13 polylinker unaltered PYK 3' UTR sequences, allowed discrimination mutant (plasmid borne) wild-type (chromosomal) PYK transcripts. construct significant alteration mRNA stability, translation PYK mRNA severely curtailed truncation 3' UTR presence strong hairpin-loop structure 3' UTR. specific mutation N-terminal coding sequences, created premature termination codon 3' 'tagged' PYK plasmid PYK/LacZ fusion gene, aborted translation majority transcripts left chemical half-lives unaltered. observation variance previously published data (Losson & Lacroute (1979) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 76, 5134; Pelsey & Lacroute (1984) Curr Genet 8, 277), consistent earlier observation obvious link ribosome loading mRNA stability yeast (Santiago et al. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res 14, 8347). Possible reasons disparity discussed.
