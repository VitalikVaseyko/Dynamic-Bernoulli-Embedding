 Phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase crude extracts chick liver activated 6 phosphogluconate subsaturating concentrations respective substrates. apparent Ka phosphofructokinase 0.79 mM pyruvate kinase 0.44 mM. Total pentose phosphate dehydrogenase activity low livers fed starved chicks. Hepatic 6 phosphogluconate concentration low measured accurately conventional spectrophotometric method. concluded concentration 6 phosphogluconate low role regulation phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activities chicken liver.
