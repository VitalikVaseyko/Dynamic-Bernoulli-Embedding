 PURPOSE: Lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH-5) regulates, hypoxic conditions, anaerobic transformation pyruvate lactate energy acquisition. Several studies shown serum LDH may ominous prognostic marker malignant tumors. clinical significance tissue LDH-5, however, remains largely unexplored. PATIENTS METHODS: investigated immunohistochemical expression LDH-5 series 128 stage II/III colorectal adenocarcinomas treated surgery alone. addition, markers tumor hypoxia (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha [HIF1alpha]), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] phosporylated kinase domain receptor [pKDR]/flk-1 receptor) tumor vascular density (CD31 positive standard vascular density [sVD] pKDR positive activated vascular density [aVD]) assessed. RESULTS: expression LDH-5, together HIF1alpha pKDR, nuclear cytoplasmic. Assessment, minimal interobserver variability, achieved using previously described scoring system. LDH-5 significantly associated HIF1alpha (P = .01), aVD (P = .001) and, particularly, pKDR expression cancer cells (P = .0001). Tissue LDH-5 expression linked elevated serum LDH levels, serum levels failed reflect tissue expression 71% LDH-5 positive cases. univariate analysis tissue LDH-5 associated poor survival (P = .0003, HR 15.1), whereas multivariate analysis isoenzyme strongest independent prognostic factor (P = .0009). VEGF, pKDR, aVD, sVD vascular invasion significantly related unfavorable prognosis. CONCLUSION: immunohistochemical assessment tissue LDH-5 pKDR provides important prognostic information operable colorectal cancer. strong association LDH-5 pKDR expression would justify use surrogate markers screen patients tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.
