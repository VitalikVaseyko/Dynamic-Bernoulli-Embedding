 Electrophoretic immunofluorescence analysis used study distribution pyruvate kinase isozymes bovine kidney. Electrophoretic analysis demonstrated presence large amounts K4 plus small amounts K-M hybrids cortical, medullary, papillary sections cut kidney. Nearly K-L hybrids seen whole kidney extracts found cortical sections. Immunofluorescence frozen sections revealed presence type L subunits tubules complete absence subunit type flomeruli. Glomeruli contain large quantities pyruvate kinase isozymes, probably K4 K-M hybrids, cross-react antibodies produced type pyruvate kinase. Type L-containing forms pyruvate kinase aldolase type B appear found cell types thought capable catalyzing gluconeogenesis, type K pyruvate kinase type aldolase found predominantly glycolytic cell types kidney. Lactate dehydrogenase isozymic patterns appear less closely correlated glycolytic versus gluconeogenic functions kidney may determined directly metabolic functions.
