 studied cultures human skeletal muscle vitro established standards biochemical markers cellular differentiation. DNA synthesis ceased time fusion, implying absence fibroblasts. Myosin heavy-chain synthesis, creatine pyruvate kinase activities, isoenzymes creatine kinase measured serially 36 days. Filamin fibronectin proteins identified cultures. Compared chick muscle culture, human skeletal muscle cells remained relatively immature. data provide basis study diseased human muscle cells culture.
