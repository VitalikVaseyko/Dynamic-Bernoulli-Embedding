 Extracts Pseudomonas citronellolis cells grown glucose gluconate possessed enzymes Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Gluconokinase either 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase KDPG aldolase induced growth substrates. Glucose gluconate dehydrogenases 6-phosphofructokinase detected. Thus catabolism glucose proceeds via inducible Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Metabolism glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate apparently proceeded via glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase pyruvate kinase. enzymes plus triose phosphate isomerase present lactate-grown cells indicating synthesis triose phosphates gluconeogenic substrates also occurs via pathway. Extracts lactate grown-cells possessed fructose diphosphatase phosphohexoisomerase apparently lacked fructose diphosphate aldolase thus indicating either presence aldolase unusual properties requirements alternative pathway conversion triose phosphate fructose disphosphate. Cells contained two species glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, one NAD-dependent enzyme predominated organism grown glycolytic substrates other, NADP-dependent enzyme predominated organism grown gluconeogenic substrates.
