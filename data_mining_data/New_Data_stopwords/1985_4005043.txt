 Pyruvate kinase L (PKL), glucoregulatory isoenzyme adult parenchymal cells, M2 (PKM2), isoenzyme proliferating non-parenchymal cells, measured, using specific anti-PKL antibody differentiation, total liver homogenates, isolated parenchymal non-parenchymal cells well microdissected periportal perivenous liver tissue regenerating rat liver two-thirds partial hepatectomy. Moreover, zonal distribution PKL studied using immunohistochemical techniques. total liver homogenates PKL activity per g liver decreased partial hepatectomy, PKM2 increased. Total PKL activity per 100 g body weight restored preoperational levels much slowly liver weight. liver regeneration parenchymal cells acquired high PKM2 besides PKL activity. isoenzyme outfit non-parenchymal cells remained unchanged. Microdissection studies showed PKL lost normal perivenous periportal gradient partial hepatectomy became evenly distributed within liver acinus. PKM2 retain even distribution, became predominant periportal zone. Immunohistochemical staining revealed partial hepatectomy PKL present parenchymal cells atypical non-zonal heterogeneous distribution. Normal specific activities well zonal cellular distributions pyruvate kinase isoenzymes restored 14-21 partial hepatectomy. regeneration 2/3 partial hepatectomy liver loses glucostat function corroborated study decrease glycolytic capacity via glucoregulatory PKL; change function accompanied loss PKL-zonation. finding corroborates view zonation carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes required liver functions glucostat. increase PKM2 appearance zonal PKM2 heterogeneity line pattern hepatocyte proliferation partial hepatectomy.
