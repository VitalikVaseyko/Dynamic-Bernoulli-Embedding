 activities key gluconeogenic, glycolytic, pentose-shunt enzymes chicken kidney determined starting 8 days 58 days hatching. activities pyruvate carboxylase (PC), mitochondrial cytosolic phosphoenolypruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase) glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) low embryonic tissue increased towards time hatching. hatching, activities PC, mitochondrial PEPCK, G6Pase continued increase, FDPase cytosolic PEPCK decreased. Relatively little change activities observed chickens 24 days old. activities hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased embryonic growth. hatching, HK activity continued increase decrease, whereas PFK appeared decrease increase prehatch levels 28-day-old birds. LDH activity continued increase 8 days hatching remained constant thereafter. definite pattern discernible case PK. pentose-shunt enzymes, significant change glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (G6PDH), activity 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) increased chickens 14 days old remained relatively constant.
