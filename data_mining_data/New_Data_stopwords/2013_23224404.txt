 performed metabolome metabolite-metabolite correlation analyses eight single-gene deletion mutants Saccharomyces cerevisiae evaluate physiology glucose metabolism. irreversible enzyme reactions become bottlenecks intracellular metabolism perturbed direct interference central metabolic pathway gene deletions deletion transcriptional regulator. Metabolome data reveal transcriptional factor, gcr2, regulates reaction converts 3-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate. Metabolome data also suggest reaction catalyzed pyruvate kinase makes one rate-limiting reactions throughout glycolytic pathway.
