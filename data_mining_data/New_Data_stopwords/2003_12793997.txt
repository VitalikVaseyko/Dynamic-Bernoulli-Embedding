 Brown adipose tissue (BAT) glyceroneogenesis evaluated rats either fasted 48 h streptozotocin-diabetes induced 3 days previously adapted 20 days high-protein, carbohydrate-free (HP) diet, conditions BAT glucose utilization reduced. three treatments induced increase BAT glyceroneogenic activity, evidenced increased rates incorporation [1-14C]pyruvate triacylglycerol (TAG)-glycerol vitro marked, threefold increase activity BAT phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). BAT glycerokinase activity significantly affected fasting diabetes. unilateral BAT denervation rats fed either HP balanced diet, glyceroneogenesis activity increased denervated pads, evidenced increased rates nonglucose carbon incorporation TAG-glycerol vivo (difference 3H2O [14C]glucose incorporations) [1-14C]pyruvate vitro. PEPCK activity significantly affected denervation. data suggest BAT glyceroneogenesis sympathetic control sensitive hormonal/metabolic factors. situations reduced glucose use increase BAT glyceroneogenesis may compensate decreased generation glycerol-3-phosphate hexose.
