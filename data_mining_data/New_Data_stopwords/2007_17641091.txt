 Boar spermatozoa contain novel pyruvate kinase (PK-S) tightly bound acrosome sperm head fibrous sheath principal piece flagellum, midpiece contains soluble pyruvate kinase (PK). PK-S could solubilized detergents, trypsin loss activity. Purified PK-S well PK-S still bound cell structures soluble sperm PK kinetics similar rabbit muscle PK-M1. PK-S subunit relative molecular mass 64 +/- 1 x 10(3) (n = 3), i.e. slightly higher PK-M1, carried N-terminal extension (NH(2)-TSEAM-COOH) lacking native PK-M1. Evidence provided PK-S encoded PKM gene. Antibodies produced N-terminus purified PK-S (NH(2)-TSEAMPKAHMDAG-COOH) specific PK-S react somatic PKs soluble sperm PK, anti-PK-M1 recognized sperm PKs. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed anti-PK-S label acrosome flagellar principal piece, whereas midpiece containing mitochondria labelled anti-PK-M1. Immunogold labelling confirmed localization PK-S acrosome. principal piece, polyclonal anti-PK-M1 anti-PK-S found fibrous sheath. results suggest PK-S major component structural organization glycolysis boar spermatozoa.
