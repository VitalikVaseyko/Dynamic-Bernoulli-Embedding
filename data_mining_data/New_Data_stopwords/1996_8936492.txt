 effect preoperative glucose infusion preoperative alterations hepatic glycogen content, activity key hepatic glucoregulatory enzymes (fructose 1,6-diphosphatase [FDPase]), pyruvate kinase (PK), hormonal developments, plasma levels free fatty acids (FFA) investigated 16 patients undergoing open cholecystectomy. Patients randomized receive (group G) receive (group C) overnight glucose infusion (5 mg.kg-1.d-1) preoperatively. Infusion glucose overnight resulted preoperative elevations insulin c-peptide (P < 0.05) lower plasma levels FFA, glucose levels found groups, 4.6 mmol/L. surgery, minor changes plasma levels insulin, c-peptide, catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, FFA found, minimal differences groups. hepatic glycogen content 65% higher group G significant reduction confirmed group patients surgery. higher glycogen content associated higher FDPase activity ratio (P < 0.05), remained unchanged surgery. contrast, significant (P < 0.05) increase activity enzyme found group C. PK activity ratio differ groups remained unchanged surgery. finding enhanced FDPase activity suggests indirect route (via gluconeogenesis) represents important contributor increased glycogen formation glucose infusion. Additionally, surgery overnight fasted patient induces enzymatic changes favoring gluconeogenesis. Lastly, preoperative high-dose glucose infusion minor effects endocrine response, plasma levels FFA, glycogen depletion elective open cholecystectomy.
