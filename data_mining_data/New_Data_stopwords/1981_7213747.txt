 1. possibility stabilizing water-soluble enzymes inactivation action organic solvents means surfactants studied. Several enzymes (alpha-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1), trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1), peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40)) used demonstrate enzymes entrapped reversed micelles formed surfactants (Aerosol OT, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, Brij 56) organic solvent (benzene, chloroform, octane, cyclohexane). enzymes solubilized way retain catalytic activity substrate specificity. 2. kinetic theory put forward describes enzymatic reactions occurring micelle-solvent pseudobiphasic system. terms theory, explanation given experimental dependence Michaelis-Menten equation parameters concentrations components medium (water, organic solvent, surfactant) also combination signs charges substrate molecule interphase (++, +-, --). 3. results obtained us may prove important applications enzymes organic synthesis studying state role water structure biomembranes active centres enzymes.
