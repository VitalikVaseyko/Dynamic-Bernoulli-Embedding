 fasting many systemic diseases, muscle undergoes rapid loss protein functional capacity. define transcriptional changes triggering muscle atrophy energy conservation fasting, used cDNA microarrays compare mRNAs muscles control food-deprived mice. Expression >94% genes change, interesting patterns emerged among genes differentially expressed: 1) mRNAs encoding polyubiquitin, ubiquitin extension proteins, many (but all) proteasome subunits increased, presumably contributes accelerated protein breakdown; 2) dramatic increase mRNA ubiquitin ligase, atrogin-1, E3s; 3) significant suppression mRNA myosin binding protein H (but myofibrillar proteins) IGF binding protein 5, may favor cell protein loss; 4) decreases mRNAs several glycolytic enzymes phosphorylase kinase subunits, dramatic increases mRNAs pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 glutamine synthase, promote glucose sparing gluconeogenesis. fasting, metallothionein mRNA increased dramatically, mRNAs extracellular matrix components fell, mRNAs may favor cap-independent mRNA translation rose. Significant changes occurred mRNAs many growth-related proteins transcriptional regulators. transcriptional changes indicate complex adaptive program favor protein degradation suppress glucose oxidation muscle. Similar analysis muscles atrophying causes allowing us identify set atrophy-specific changes gene expression.
