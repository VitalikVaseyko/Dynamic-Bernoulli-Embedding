 addition chlorpropamide hepatocytes isolated fed rats raised cellular concentration fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2), regulatory metabolite plays relevant role control hepatic glucose metabolism. effect chlorpropamide dose dependent; statistically significant increase already seen 0.2 mM sulfonylurea. accumulation F-2,6-P2 caused chlorpropamide (1 mM) parallel stimulation L-lactate production (36.6 +/- 4.8 versus 26.1 +/- 2.6 mumol lactate/g cells X 20 min; N = 5, P less 0.05) inhibition gluconeogenesis (0.57 +/- 0.1 versus 0.94 +/- 0.09 mumol [U-14C]pyruvate converted glucose/g cells X 20 min; N = 5, P less 0.05). addition, chlorpropamide enhanced inhibitory action evoked insulin glucagon-stimulated gluconeogenesis. combined effect chlorpropamide insulin seems correlated synergistic accumulation F-2,6-P2 provoked simultaneous action two agents glucagon-treated hepatocytes. Finally, neither 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity hepatocyte cyclic AMP levels significantly changed presence sulfonylurea incubation medium. results support concept chlorpropamide, cyclic AMP-independent mechanism, increases hepatic content F-2,6-P2 and, way, enhances glycolytic flux inhibits glucose output liver.
