 noctuid winter moths fly near 0 degrees C maintaining elevated(30 degrees 35 degrees C) thoracic muscle temperature. Geometrid winter moths sustain free flight subzero muscle temperatures. However, temperature characteristics citrate synthase pyruvate kinase different kinds moths sphinx moth flies muscles temperature 40 degrees C nearly identical. Furthermore, mass-specific rates energy expenditure kinds winter moths also similar given thoracic temperature (near 0 degrees C). geometrids able fly thoracic temperature near 0 degrees C largely unusually low wing-loading, permits low energetic cost flight.
