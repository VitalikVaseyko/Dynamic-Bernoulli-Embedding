 Azotobacter vinelandii ArrF iron-responsive small RNA negative control Ferric uptake regulator protein. A. vinelandii arrF mutant deletion entire arrF gene known overproduce poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). Proteins differentially expressed mutant identified gel-based proteomics confirmed real-time RT-PCR. 6-Phosphogluconolactonase E(1) component pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, leads production NADPH acetyl-CoA, upregulated, proteins tricarboxylic acid cycle consumes acetyl-CoA downregulated. Heat-shock proteins HSP20 GroEL highly overexpressed mutant. Antioxidant proteins Fe-containing superoxide dismutase (FeSOD), putative oxidoreductase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, flavorprotein WrbA, cysteine synthase also overexpressed arrF mutant, indicating PHB accumulation stressful cells. Upregulated arrF mutant acetyl-CoA carboxylase, flagellin, adenylate kinase, though reasons overexpression unclear. Among genes upregulated mutant, sodB coding FeSOD phbF encoding PHB synthesis regulator PhbF negatively regulated small RNA ArrF probably antisense mechanism. deletion arrF gene, therefore, would increase PhbF FeSOD levels, favors PHB synthesis mutant. hand, glutamate synthetase, elongation factor-Tu, iron ABC transporter, major outer membrane porin OprF downregulated arrF mutant. Based results, concluded multiple factors including direct effect small RNA ArrF might responsible PHB overproduction mutant.
