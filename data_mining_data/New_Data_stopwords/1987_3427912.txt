 1. kinetic characteristics pyruvate kinase isozymes oocytes, embryos, liver skeletal muscle clawed frog Xenopus laevis measured cell extracts. 2. muscle liver isozymes display Michaelis-Menten kinetics Kms phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 0.02 0.05 mM, respectively. 3. Pyruvate kinase oocytes embryos displays cooperative kinetics PEP Km 0.15 mM; kinetics become hyperbolic Km PEP reduced 0.05 mM presence microM concentrations fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. 4. data serve characterize pyruvate kinase activity oocytes embryos kinetics compared mammalian pyruvate kinase isozymes.
