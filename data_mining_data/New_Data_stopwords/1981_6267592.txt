 Membrane vesicles Salmonella typhimurium induced phosphoglycerate transport, loaded pyruvate kinase ADP lysing spheroplasts appropriate conditions. Vesicles prepared catalyze active transport proline serine presence phosphoenolpyruvate; activity abolished protonophore carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone H+-ATPase inhibitor N,N' dicyclohexylcarbodiimide anoxia cyanide. contrast, D-lactate-driven active transport abolished hydrazone anoxia cyanide carbodiimide. Moreover, phosphoenolpyruvate drive transport effectively vesicles lack phosphoglycerate transport system. results consistent overall mechanism phosphoenolpyruvate gains access interior vesicles means phosphoglycerate transporter acted pyruvate kinase phosphorylate ADP. ATP formed inside vesicles hydrolyzed H+-ATPase, leading generation proton electrochemical gradient drives H+/solute symport. using pBR322 vector Escherichia coli host, fragment S. typhimurium DNA coding phosphoglycerate transport system cloned. E. coli membrane vesicles containing phosphoglycerate transport system also catalyze transport presence phosphoenolpyruvate loaded pyruvate kinase ADP.
