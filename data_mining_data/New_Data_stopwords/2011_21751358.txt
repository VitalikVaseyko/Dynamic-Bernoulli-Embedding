 Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) associated platelet activation. aim present study study protein expression level associated glycolysis, oxidative stress, cytoskeleton cell survival platelets obtained ACS. Platelets 42 coronary ischemic patients, divided patients admitted within 24 h onset chest pain (ACS group; n=16) patients stable coronary ischemic disease (CAD, n=26), analyzed using proteomics. expression levels proteins involved cellular cytoskeleton (F-actin capping, beta-tubulin, alpha-tubulin isotypes 1 2, vinculin, vimentin two Ras-related protein Rab-7b isotypes), glycolysis pathway (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase two pyruvate kinase isotypes) cellular-related antioxidant system (manganese superoxide dismutase) even expression activity glutathione-S-transferase significantly reduced platelets ACS patients compared CAD patients. Moreover, reduction expression proteins associated cell survival proteasome subunit beta type 1 also observed ACS platelets compared CAD platelets. Principal component logistic regression analysis suggested existence factors (proteins) expressed platelets inversely associated acute coronary ischemia. summary, results suggest existence circulating antioxidant, cytoskeleton glycolytic-"bewildered" platelets acute phase coronary event.
