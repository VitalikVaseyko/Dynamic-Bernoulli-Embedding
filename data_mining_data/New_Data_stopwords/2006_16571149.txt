 present study evaluated effect dietary methionine breast-meat accretion protein expression skeletal muscle broiler chickens vivo. broilers received common pre-test diet 21 age, subsequently fed either methionine-deficient (MD) -adequate (MA) diet (3.1 v. 4.5 g/kg diet) age 21 42 d. Dietary cystine levels 3.7 v. 3.6 g/kg diet MD diet, respectively. Detrimental effects carcass yield (P=0.004), abdominal fat percentage (P=0.001), breast-meat weight (P=0.001), yield (P=0.001), uniformity (P=0.002) observed validated birds fed MD diets. Via tandem MS, total 190 individual proteins identified pectoralis major (PM) muscle tissue. former composite, peptides three proteins observed present exclusively breast muscle chickens fed MD diet (pyruvate kinase, myosin alkali light chain-1, ribosomal-protein-L-29). proteins observed uniquely expressed chickens fed diets. Research warranted explore possibility proteins pyruate kinase, myosin alkali light chain-1, ribosomal protein L-29, potential biological indicators differences protein expression PM chickens response dietary methionine deficiency.
