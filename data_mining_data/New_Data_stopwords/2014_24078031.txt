 Epidemiological studies demonstrated diabetes mellitus serious health burden governments healthcare providers. study hypothesized evaluate antihyperglycemic potential eugenol determine activities key enzymes glucose metabolism streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes induced male albino Wistar rats intraperitoneal administration STZ (40 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)). Eugenol administered diabetic rats intragastrically 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg b.w. 30 days. dose 10 mg/kg b.w. significantly reduced levels blood glucose glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) increased plasma insulin level. altered activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, liver marker enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP), creatine kinase blood urea nitrogen serum blood diabetic rats significantly reverted near normal levels administration eugenol. Further, eugenol administration diabetic rats improved body weight hepatic glycogen content demonstrated antihyperglycemic potential eugenol diabetic rats. present findings suggest eugenol potentially ameliorate key enzymes glucose metabolism experimental diabetes, sensible broaden scale use eugenol trial alleviate adverse effects diabetes.
