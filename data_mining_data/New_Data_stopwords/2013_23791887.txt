 Altered metabolism fundamental growth survival cancer cells. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), key enzyme cancer metabolism, demonstrated play central role metabolic reprogramming also direct regulation gene expression subsequent cell cycle progression. review outlines current understanding PKM2 protein kinase activity regulatory mechanisms underlying PKM2 expression, enzymatic activity, nuclear localization, thus highlighting PKM2 potential therapeutic target.
