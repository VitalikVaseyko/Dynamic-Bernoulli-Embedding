 aim work investigate effect decreased cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) plastidic NADP-dependent malic enzyme (ME) tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) ripening. Transgenic tomato plants strongly reduced levels PEPCK plastidic NADP-ME generated RNA interference gene silencing control ripening-specific E8 promoter. genetic modifications relatively little effect total fruit yield size, strong effects fruit metabolism. transformants characterized lower levels starch breaker stage. Analysis activation state ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase correlated decrease starch transformants, suggests due altered cellular redox status. Moreover, metabolic profiling feeding experiments involving positionally labeled glucoses fruits lacking plastidic NADP-ME cytosolic PEPCK activities revealed differential changes overall respiration rates tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux. Inactivation cytosolic PEPCK affected respiration rate, suggests excess oxaloacetate converted aspartate reintroduced TCA cycle via 2-oxoglutarate/glutamate. hand, plastidic NADP-ME antisense lines characterized changes respiration rates TCA cycle flux, together increases pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activities indicate pyruvate supplied enzymes TCA cycle. results discussed context current models importance malate tomato fruit ripening.
