 Cardiomyocytes intracellular diffusion restrictions, spatially compartmentalize ADP ATP. However, models predict diffusion restrictions used data sets generated rat heart permeabilized fibers, diffusion distances may heterogeneous. avoided using isolated, permeabilized cardiomyocytes. aim work analyze intracellular diffusion ATP ADP rat permeabilized cardiomyocytes. this, measured respiration rate, ATPase rate, ADP concentration surrounding solution. data analyzed using mathematical models reflect different levels cell compartmentalization. agreement previous studies, found significant diffusion restriction mitochondrial outer membrane confirmed functional coupling mitochondria fraction ATPases cell. addition, experimental data show considerable activity endogenous pyruvate kinase (PK) remains cardiomyocytes permeabilization. fraction ATPases inactive without ATP feedback endogenous PK. analyzing data, able reproduce measurements mathematical models include tight coupling fraction endogenous PK ATPases. knowledge, first time strong coupling PK ATPases demonstrated permeabilized cardiomyocytes.
