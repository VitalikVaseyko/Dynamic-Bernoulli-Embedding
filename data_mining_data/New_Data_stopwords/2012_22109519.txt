 Metabolism altered many highly prevalent diseases controlled complex network intracellular regulators. Monitoring cell metabolism treatment extremely valuable investigate cellular response treatment efficacy. describe nuclear magnetic resonance-based method screening metabolomic response drug-treated mammalian cells 96-well format. validate method using drugs well-characterized targets report results screen kinase inhibitor library. Four hits validated action important clinical parameter, lactate pyruvate ratio. eEF-2 kinase inhibitor NF-kB activation inhibitor increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, whereas MK2 inhibitor inhibitor PKA, PKC PKG induced decrease. method validated cell lines primary cancer cells, may potential applications drug development personalized therapy.
