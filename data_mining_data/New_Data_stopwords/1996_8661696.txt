 group developed 600 DNA markers build map canine genome. markers, 125 correspond genes (anchor loci). report first six autosomal genes assigned canine chromosomes fluorescence situ hybridization (FISH), using cosmid DNA: adenine phosphoribosyl transferase Chromosome (Chr) 3; creatine kinase muscle type Chr 4; pyruvate kinase liver red blood cell type Chr 2; colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, glucose transporter protein-2, tumor protein p53 Chr 5. assignments based karyotype proposed Stone associates (Genome 34, 407, 1991) using high-resolution techniques. addition, assigned Menkes gene X Chr dog.
