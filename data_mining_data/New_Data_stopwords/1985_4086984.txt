 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex demonstrated high speed pellet preparations sonicated ribbed mussel gill mitochondria. activity complex inhibited low chloride (less 100 mM) concentrations, EDTA (1 mM), succinate, ATP, NAD/NADH ratios 4. Inhibition EDTA relieved addition 10 mM MgCl2-1 mM CaCl2. ATP inhibition enhanced NaF reversed high Mg++ concentrations absence NaF. Pyruvate thiamine pyrophosphate inhibited inactivation ATP. nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP caused inhibition overall catalytic activity identical ATP. Factors involved ATP inhibition Mg++ reversal lost freezing cold storage. Preliminary results using gamma-32P-ATP indicate protein kinase phosphorylates alpha subunit E1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase) mammalian PDC associated gill PDC. activity complex may regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism relative levels substrates, products, metabolites mitochondria.
