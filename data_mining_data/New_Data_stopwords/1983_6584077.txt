 Three important points must emphasized summary. First idea cellular microcompartment need limited semi-permeable membrane. recognize microcompartments multi-enzyme complexes substrates covalently transported subunit subunit. example lipoic acid moiety pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. However, act kinetic microcompartment, covalent transfer obligatory requirement. Proximity effects may sufficient substantial rate enhancement. data clearly show kinetics ADP translocation influenced site ADP formation. contend represents newly recognized important form cellular microcompartmentation. second point want results misinterpreted overextension known data concerning tissue respiration. believe primary parameter controlling heart mitochondrial oxygen consumption availability ADP adenine nucleotide translocase. data show, however, simple process. Secondary control exerted localization ADP formation, i.e. microcompartmentation. result kinetic data (Table 3), conclude forward rate mitochondrial creatine kinase preferential reaction controlling ADP delivery translocase. left, nonetheless, questions concerning secondary regulation enzyme vivo substrate (ATP creatine) inhibition product (phosphocreatine). nature control awaits experimental data. Finally, results consistent creatine kinase energy transport hypothesis. Overall, rate tissue oxygen consumption reflects metabolic activity organ, determined rate ATP utilization (see right side Figure 1). results cytoplasmic production ADP. heart, coupled via bound cytoplasmic isozymes creatine kinase local rephosphorylation ADP ATP simultaneous production creatine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
