 biological systems energy serves ultimate commodity, often determining species distributions, abundances, interactions including potential impact invasive species native communities. Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis invaded San Francisco Estuary (SFE) 1986 implicated decline native fish species resource competition. Using combined laboratory/field study examined energy expenditure clam influenced salinity, temperature food availability. Measures metabolism made whole organism (metabolic rate) biochemical (pyruvate kinase (PK) citrate synthase (CS) enzyme activities) levels. found field, course year, ratio PK CS typically 1.0 suggesting aerobic fermentative metabolism roughly equivalent, except particular periods characterized low salinity, higher temperatures, intermediate food availabilities. 30-day laboratory acclimation experiment, however, neither metabolic rate PK:CS ratio consistently influenced variables, though potential fermentative pathways predominate. conclude field collected animals, addition biochemical measures energetic state provide little additional information previously measured whole organism metabolic rate. addition, much variation laboratory remained unexplained additional variables, including reproductive stage body condition may influence laboratory-based results. study adult clams must consider role organismal condition, especially reproductive state, comparisons laboratory experiments field observations.
