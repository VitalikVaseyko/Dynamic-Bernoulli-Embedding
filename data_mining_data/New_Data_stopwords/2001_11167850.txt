 four unrelated patients chronic haemolysis markedly reduced red blood cell (RBC) glutathione (49.5%, 12.6%, 11.5% 15% normal concentration respectively), severe glutathione synthetase (GSH-S, EC 6.3.2.3) deficiency found. One case exhibited neonatal haemolytic anaemia associated oxoprolinuria, without neurological manifestations. family study revealed GSH-S activity parents around half normal level, finding consistent presumed autosomal recessive mode inheritance enzymopathy. Two cases exhibited well-compensated haemolytic syndrome without anaemia splenomegaly steady state. One cases diagnosed episode acute haemolytic anaemia fava bean ingestion. remaining patient suffered moderate severe chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia splenomegaly, required occasional blood transfusion haemolytic crisis associated drug ingestion. patient, anaemia corrected splenectomy. addition GSH-S, panel 16 RBC enzyme activities also studied patients. Hexokinase, aldolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities increased; increases expected, given rise number circulating reticulocytes. two patients, incubation RBCs hydrogen peroxide revealed enhanced production malonyldialdehyde. DNA analysis showed homozygous state 656 A-->G mutation patients 2 3. GSH-S gene patient 1, studied elsewhere, revealed 808 T-->C. GSH-S gene patient 4 available study. present study demonstrates GSH-S deficiency also present Spain supports molecular clinical heterogeneity enzymopathy
