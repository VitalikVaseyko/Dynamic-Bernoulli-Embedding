 Concentrations creatinine, determined serum method involving combined use creatinine amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.2.10) alkaline sodium picrate found factitiously low, owing reversal enzyme reaction. effect could eliminated converting creatine, product enzymic reaction, creatine phosphate. combined enzymic-Jaffe method therefore modified include creatine amidohydrolase, creatine kinase, ATP, Mg2+ reaction mixture. modified method good precision. saw significant interferences relatively high concentrations acetone, acetylacetone, ADP, creatine, creatine phosphate, glucose, glycocyamine, pyruvate. Likewise, interferences evident icteric, lipemic, hemolytic serum samples. excellent agreement creatinine values obtained method reference method based isotope dilution-mass fragmentography. method considerably simpler fully enzymic method determination creatinine might method choice high accuracy desired.
