 Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pivotal role oxygen homeostasis cardioprotection mediated ischemic preconditioning. stability regulated HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs), inhibition regarded promising strategy treating diseases anemia ischemia. generated viable Hif-p4h-2 hypomorph mouse line (Hif-p4h-2(gt/gt)) expresses decreased amounts wild-type Hif-p4h-2 mRNA: 8% heart; 15% skeletal muscle; 34-47% kidney, spleen, lung, bladder; 60% brain; 85% liver. mice polycythemia show signs dilated cardiomyopathy hyperactive angiogenesis observed mice broad spectrum conditional Hif-p4h-2 inactivation. focused effects chronic Hif-p4h-2 deficiency heart. Hif-1 Hif-2 stabilized, mRNA levels glucose transporter-1, several enzymes glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, angiopoietin-2, adrenomedullin increased Hif-p4h-2(gt/gt) hearts. isolated Hif-p4h-2(gt/gt) hearts subjected ischemia-reperfusion, recovery mechanical function coronary flow rate significantly better wild type, cumulative release lactate dehydrogenase reflecting infarct size reduced. preischemic amount lactate increased, ischemic versus preischemic [CrP]/[Cr] [ATP] remained higher levels Hif-p4h-2(gt/gt) hearts, indicating enhanced glycolysis improved cellular energy state. data suggest chronic stabilization Hif-1alpha Hif-2alpha genetic knockdown Hif-p4h-2 promotes cardioprotection induction many genes involved glucose metabolism, cardiac function, blood pressure.
