 BACKGROUND: cancer cells exhibit increased anaerobic glycolysis use metabolic pathway generation ATP main source energy. impaired metabolism glucose, leading secretion lactic acid even presence oxygen, named Warburg effect. cancer cells partly mainly dependent pathway generate ATP, inhibition glycolysis may slow proliferation kill cells. MATERIALS METHODS: effect 3-Bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) alone associated cisplatin nude mice presenting intraperitoneal carcinomatosis developed intraperitoneal injection human mesothelioma cells (MSTO-211H) investigated. RESULTS: 3-BrPA significantly prolonged survival animals. Combined cisplatin, demonstrated significant benefit survival whereas cisplatin alone mild effect. CONCLUSION: 3-BrPA may thus constitute interesting novel anticancer drug could tested humans.
