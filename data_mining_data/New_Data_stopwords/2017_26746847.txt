 Incorporation plant blend diet affect growth parameters metabolism carnivorous fish. studied first time long-term (1 year) metabolic response rainbow trout fed first feeding plant-based diet totally devoid marine ingredients. Hepatic enzymes analyzed enzymatic molecular levels, 3, 8 24 h last meal study short-term effects last meal long-term effects diet. results compared fish fed control diet fish meal fish oil. Growth, feed intake, feed efficiency protein retention lower group fed plant-based diet. Glucokinase pyruvate kinase activity lower livers trout fed plant-based diet proportion starch lower control diet. Glutamate dehydrogenase induced plant-based diet, suggesting imbalance amino acids possible link lower protein retention observed. Gene expression delta 6 desaturase higher fish fed plant-based diet, probably linked high dietary level linolenic acid absence long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids vegetable oils. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase expression also induced plant-based diet low rate cholesterol diet. Changes regulation mechanisms already identified short-term nutritional experiments (<12 weeks) suggest metabolic responses implemented short term remain long term.
