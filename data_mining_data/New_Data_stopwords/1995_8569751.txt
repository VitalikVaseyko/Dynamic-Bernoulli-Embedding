 Sensitivity rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) pyruvate inhibition tested various conditions using pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) mitochondria (mPDC) high speed precipitate whole tissue homogenates (hPDC). latter preparation pyruvate range concentration 1-10 mM caused increasing inhibition PDHK enzyme prepared animals fed ad libitum effect enzyme prepared 48 h starved animals. Similar behaviour observed mPDC fed starved animals rotenone present, pyruvate 1 mM concentration stimulated PDHK hearts fed animals without effect 10 mM. mPDC hPDC hearts starved animals incubated 30 degrees C 30 min, inhibition PDHK pyruvate restored.
