 Activity pyruvate kinase free bound structural components revealed brain red mullet. bound form disappeared result 1.5 hour hypoxia. Hill coefficients phosphoenolpyruvate ADP enzyme forms 1, Michaelis constants free enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate ADP 2-3 times higher bound form. pH-dependence enzymes similar. free enzyme studied result heating probes 45 degrees C 15 minutes, bound form successively activated stabilized within procedure. ATP inhibition forms same. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate alanine affect pyruvate kinase activity. Possible mechanisms regulation kinetic properties redistribution pyruvate kinase free bound states discussed.
