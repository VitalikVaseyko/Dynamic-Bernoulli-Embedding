 OBJECTIVE: investigate whether hepatic oval cells activated diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat liver cirrhosis, explore mechanism. METHODS: Liver cirrhosis induced rats (n=8) weekly intraperitoneal injections DEN dose 50mg/kg body weight 12 weeks followed 2-week wash period. Rats (n=5) received isovolumic vehicle served control group. Liver pathology examined. Apoptotic hepatocytes identified quantified terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. Oval cells detected using immunohistochemical staining pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2PK) cytokeratin 19 (CK19). work carried Renmin Hospital Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China February December 2009. RESULTS: Liver cirrhosis developed rats subjected DEN administration. TUNEL morphology assay showed substantial number hepatocytes underwent apoptosis. apoptotic index rats subjected DEN administration (0.75 0.15) much higher normal control rats (0.10 0.05). CK19 M2PK moderately expressed rat liver cirrhosis, expression dispersed forming small cords liver; expression hardly detected liver tissue normal control rats. CONCLUSION: DEN-induced rat liver cirrhosis, oval cells activated stimulated proliferation, mechanism may related substantial hepatocyte apoptosis model.
