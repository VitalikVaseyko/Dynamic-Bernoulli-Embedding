 Kinetic isotope effects association measured using remote label methodology developed O'Leary Marlier (1979). isotope effect V/KA first substrate obligatorily ordered mechanism isotope effect second-order rate constant association enzyme. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 18(V/KPEP) bridging labeled decreases 1.0056 +/- 0.0007 0.9943 +/- 0.0002 concentration bicarbonate, second substrate, increases 2 200 mM. pyruvate kinase 18(V/KPEP) decreases 1.0024 +/- 0.0014 0.9928 +/- 0.0027 concentration ADP increases 1.5 30 mM. inverse kinetic isotope effects best understood arising isotope effect rate constant forming Michaelis complex enzyme substrate. inverse value suggests bridging oxygen vibrationally stiffer environment transition state association reaction.
