 Regulation mitochondrial respiration endogenous exogenous ADP cells situ studied isolated permeabilized cardiomyocytes, permeabilized cardiac fibers 'ghost' fibers (all diameter 10-20 micro m) different (0-3 micro moll(-1)) free Ca(2+) concentrations medium. preparations, apparent K(m) mitochondrial respiration exogenous ADP free Ca(2+) concentrations 0-0.1 micro moll(-1) high, range 250-350 micro moll(-1), contrast isolated mitochondria vitro (apparent K(m) ADP approximately 20 micro moll(-1)). increase free Ca(2+) concentration (up 3 micro moll(-1), within physiological range), resulted significant decrease apparent K(m) value 20-30 micro moll(-1), decrease V(max) respiration permeabilized intact fibers strong contraction sarcomeres. ghost cardiac fibers, myosin extracted mitochondria intact, neither high apparent K(m) ADP (300-350 micro moll(-1)) V(max) respiration changed range free Ca(2+) concentration studied, sarcomere contraction observed. exogenous-ADP-trapping system (pyruvate kinase + phosphoenolpyruvate) inhibited endogenous-ADP-supported respiration permeabilized cells 40%, inhibition reversed creatine due activation mitochondrial creatine kinase. results taken show strong structural associations (functional complexes) among mitochondria, sarcomeres sarcoplasmic reticulum. Inside complexes, mitochondrial functional state controlled channeling ADP, mostly via energy- phosphoryl-transfer networks, apparently depends state sarcomere structures.
