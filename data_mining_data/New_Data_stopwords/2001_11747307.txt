 mechanism pyruvate kinase (PK) allosterically activated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) poorly understood. identify residues key allostery yeast PK, point mutation strategy used. T403E R459Q mutations FBP binding site caused reduced FBP affinity. Introducing positive charges 403, 458, 406 positions FBP binding site little consequence. mutation Q299N [bond] subunit interface caused enzyme response ADP sensitive FBP. T311M [bond] interface mutant decreased affinity PEP FBP, dependent FBP activity. R369A mutation C [bond] C interface moderately influenced allostery. Creating E392A mutation C [bond] C subunit interface eliminated cooperativity allosteric regulation. None seven [bond] C domain interface mutations altered allostery. model includes central role E392 allosteric regulation yeast PK proposed.
