 animal tissues pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulated product inhibition phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle catalysed kinase phosphatase. Physiologic molecular aspects regulation reviewed, results recent studies described. Insulin deficiency rat (diabetes starvation) shown inhibit conversion inactive (phospho-) complex active (dephospho-) complex phosphatase effect substrate phosphatase (phosphorylated complex). change stable persists isolation, incubation, extraction mitochondria purification phosphorylated complex. subunit ratios purified pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex stoichiometry phosphorylations determined radioamidination incorporation 32P. ratios decarboxylase tetramer (alpha 2, beta 2) : dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase monomer : dihydrolipoly dehydrogenase monomer 1:1:0.5. Inactivation complex accomplished incorporation single phosphate one alpha subunit decarboxylase tetramer. Two phosphates incorporated additional phosphorylations inhibit reactivation complex phosphate. suggested multisite phosphorylations may inhibit reactivation complex phosphatase diabetes starvation.
