 Src kinase, prototype member Src family kinases (SFKs), over-expressed various human tumors, become target anticancer drug design. perspective, series eighteen 2-pyridone derivatives synthesized evaluated c-Src kinase inhibitory activity. Among them, eight compounds exhibited c-Src kinase inhibitory activity IC50 value less 25muM. Compound 1-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-5-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one (36) exhibited highest c-Src kinase inhibition IC50 value 12.5muM. Furthermore, kinase inhibitory activity compound 36 studied EGFR, MAPK PDK, however significant activity observed highest tested concentration (300muM). results provide insights optimization scaffold designing next generation 2-pyridone derivatives candidate Src kinase inhibitors.
