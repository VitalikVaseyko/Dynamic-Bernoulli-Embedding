 Nano-encapsulation several natural products become important tool enhancing bioavailability modern drugs many diseases. Pelargonidin anthocyanidin found many fruits vegetables. Pelargonidin loaded poly-lactide-co-glycolic-acid, non-toxic biodegradable polymer, produce nano-pelargonidin. Size, morphology, zeta potential, planar uniformity formulated nano-pelargonidin determined atomic force microscopy dynamic light scattering. time required cellular entry, folds nano-pelargonidin, drug encapsulation efficiency poly-lactide-co-glycolic-acid also ascertained. Relative functional efficacy nano-pelargonidin pelargonidin evaluated examining markers pyruvate kinase, glucokinase, calcium ion level, ATP/ADP ratio, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic release mitochondrial cytochrome-c, structural analysis mitochondrial DNA controlled experimental sets alloxan-induced hyperglycemic L6 cells. Expressions mitochondrial apoptotic proteins, bcl2 caspase3, glucose signalling cascades, GLUT4, IRS1, IRS2, PI3, analyzed. Nano-pelargonidin nearly 10-fold reduced dose significantly enhanced protection, presumably due smaller size, ability faster entry, drug delivery target-specific sites. Thus, nano-pelargonidin used formulating protective drugs therapeutic management mitochondrial dysfunction often encountered diabetic conditions.
