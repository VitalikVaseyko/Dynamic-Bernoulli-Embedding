 Glucagon (250 microgram/kg body wt.) intravenously injected normal fed rats produces within 5 min marked inactivation liver phosphofructokinase, observed enzyme activity measured subsaturating concentrations fructose 6-phosphate. Since half-maximal inactivation observed dose glucagon 0.32 microgram/body wt., dose within range physiological concentrations hormone, inactivation phosphofructokinase occur vivo response physiological changes concentration glucagon. gluconeogenic conditions (starved rats high-protein-diet-fed rats), marked inactivation liver phosphofructokinase subsaturating concentrations fructose 6-phosphate similar found normal fed rats glucagon treatment. gluconeogenic conditions 50% decrease Vmax. enzyme also observed. significant changes phosphofructokinase activity either subsaturating concentrations fructose 6-phosphate Vmax. enzyme observed rats fed high-carbohydrate diet. last dietary condition, glucagon treatment produces similar effects described normal fed rats. Similar results obtained condtions pyruvate kinase L activity measured subsaturating concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate.
