 CONTEXT: TGF-beta believed play major role etiology peritoneal endometriosis. tumors, TGF-beta induces metabolic conversion glucose lactate via glycolysis, process referred "Warburg effect." Lactate increases cell invasion, angiogenesis, immune suppression, crucial steps development endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: aim study determine whether TGF-beta induces "Warburg-like" effect peritoneal endometriosis. DESIGN: study informed human tissue analysis cel culture. SETTING: study conducted university research institute. PATIENTS PARTICIPANTS: studied women undergoing surgical investigation endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS: Concentrations lactate TGF-beta1 peritoneal fluid (n = 16) measured commercial assay. Expression genes implicated glycolysis measured endometrial peritoneal biopsies (n = 31) quantitative RT-PCR immunohistochemistry. effect TGF-beta1 primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells (n = 6) immortalized mesothelial (MeT-5A) cells (n = 3) assessed quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, commercial assays. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lactate, TGF-beta1, markers glycolysis measured. RESULTS: Concentrations lactate peritoneal fluid paralleled TGF-beta1, significantly higher women endometriosis compared women without (P < .05). Endometriosis lesions expressed higher levels glycolysis-associated genes HIF1A, PDK1, LDHA eutopic endometrium, adjacent peritoneum higher levels HIF1A SLC2A1 peritoneum women without disease (P < .05 P < .001). Exposure mesothelial cells TGF-beta1 increased production lactate (P < .05), increased HIF1A mRNA (P < .05), protein, increased concentrations mRNAs encoded glycolysis-associated genes (LDHA, PDK1, SLC2A1; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: change metabolic phenotype endometriosis lesions peritoneal mesothelium women endometriosis may favor development endometriosis.
