 liver innervated sympathetic parasympathetic nerves. effects mechanisms actions hepatic nerves studied isolated rat, guinea pig Tupaia liver perfused non-recirculating manner either via portal vein via hepatic artery portal vein. arterial plexus stimulated common hepatic artery, portal plexus mesenteric vein plexus jointly artery portal vein liver hilus (1-20 Hz, 2 ms, 20 V, 0.5-5 min). Upon nerve stimulation sympathetic effects clearly predominated; parasympathetic actions could demonstrated presence alpha- beta-antagonists. Sympathetic stimulation increased glucose output, shifted lactate uptake output, decreased ketone body, urea glutamine formation well ammonia uptake, lowered oxygen uptake, reduced perfusion flow combined intrahepatic redistribution perfusate mobilization, caused overflow noradrenaline hepatic vein. effects mediated predominantly via alpha-receptors; dependent extracellular calcium. effects modulated hormones: glucagon-mediated increase glucose output enhanced lactate uptake decreased nerve stimulation; presence insulin glucose output increased slightly. Parasympathetic stimulation effect basal metabolism hemodynamics. Yet, antagonized glucagon-stimulated glucose release enhanced slight, insulin-dependent increase glucose utilization. sympathetic nerves may act directly parenchymal cells indirectly via overflow neurotransmitter vasculature via hemodynamic changes. Experiments vessel relaxant sodium nitroprusside retrograde perfusion indicate neither hemodynamic alterations noradrenaline overflow vasculature play major role sympathetic alterations glucose lactate metabolism; rather nerves appear act directly within parenchyma. Comparative studies rat, guinea pig tupaia livers corroborate view sympathetic nerves act rat via contacts periportal hepatocytes signal propagation gap junctions, act guinea pig tupaia via contacts almost parenchymal cells.
