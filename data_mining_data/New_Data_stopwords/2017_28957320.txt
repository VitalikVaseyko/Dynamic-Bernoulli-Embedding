 Cancer cells share several metabolic traits, including aerobic production lactate glucose (Warburg effect), extensive glutamine utilization impaired mitochondrial electron flow. still unclear metabolic rearrangements, may involve different molecular events different cells, contribute selective advantage cancer cell proliferation. ascertain metabolic pathways used convert glucose glutamine balanced energy biomass production, performed systematic constraint-based simulations model human central metabolism. Sampling feasible flux space allowed us obtain large number randomly mutated cells simulated different glutamine glucose uptake rates. observed that, limited subset proliferating cells, displayed fermentation glucose lactate presence oxygen. high utilization rates glutamine, oxidative utilization glucose decreased, production lactate glutamine enhanced. emergent phenotype observed available carbon exceeded amount could fully oxidized available oxygen. latter conditions, standard Flux Balance Analysis indicated that: metabolic pattern optimal maximize biomass ATP production; requires activity branched TCA cycle, glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates production lipids proteins; sustained variety redox-controlled metabolic reactions. K-ras transformed cell line experimentally assessed glutamine-induced metabolic changes. validated computational results extension Flux Balance Analysis allows prediction metabolite variations. Taken together findings offer new understanding logic metabolic reprogramming underlies cancer cell growth.
