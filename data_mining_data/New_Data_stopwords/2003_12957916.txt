 Streptococcus oralis, member mitis group oral streptococci, implicated pathogenesis infective endocarditis predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus dental plaque. undertook identify abundant surface-associated proteins S. oralis investigate changes protein expression organism grown acidic culture conditions. Surface-associated proteins extracted cells grown batch culture, separated two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested trypsin, analyzed matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time flight mass spectrometry liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Putative functions assigned homology translated genomic database Streptococcus pneumoniae. total 27 proteins identified; included lipoprotein, ribosome recycling factor, glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase. abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein HPr, present three isoforms. Neither lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, present among proteins gels, demonstrating proteins surface-associated pool arise result cell lysis. Eleven proteins identified differentially expressed cells grown pH 5.2 versus pH 7.0, included superoxide dismutase, homologue dipeptidase V Lactococcus lactis, protein translation elongation factors G, Tu, Ts. study extended range streptococcal proteins known expressed cell surface. investigations required ascertain functions extracellular location determine expression influenced environmental conditions.
