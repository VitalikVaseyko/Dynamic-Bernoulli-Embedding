 Metabolic reprogramming one frequent stress-adaptive response cancer cells survive environmental changes meet increasing nutrient requirements growth. modifications involve cellular bioenergetics cross talk surrounding microenvironment, dynamic network connect different molecular processes, energy production, inflammatory response, drug resistance. Even though Warburg effect long considered main metabolic feature cancer cells, recent reports identify mitochondrial oxidative metabolism driving force tumor growth increasing number cellular contexts. recent years, oxidative phosphorylation linked remodeling inflammatory response due autocrine paracrine secretion interleukines that, turn, induces regulation gene expression involving, among others, molecules responsible onset drug resistance. process especially relevant ovarian cancer, characterized low survival, high frequency disease relapse chemoresistance. Recently, molecular chaperone TRAP1 (tumor necrosis factor-associated protein 1) identified key junction molecule processes ovarian cancer: fact, TRAP1 mediates metabolic switch toward oxidative phosphorylation that, turn, triggers cytokines secretion, consequent gene expression remodeling, finally leading cisplatin resistance epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ovarian cancer models. review summarizes metabolism, chemoresistance, inflammation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition strictly interconnected, TRAP1 stays crossroads processes, thus shedding new lights molecular networks basis ovarian cancer.
