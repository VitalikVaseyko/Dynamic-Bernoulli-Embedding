 isozyme patterns activities six enzymes determined surgical biopsy samples lung tumors non-neoplastic pulmonary areas. Fetal lungs also examined. tissue differences found isozyme pattern hexokinase alkaline phosphatase; small differences pyruvate kinase isozyme proportions observed. tumors exhibited significant deviations respect lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) malate dehydrogenase (MDH) isozyme patterns. Despite diversity cell types, proportions M-subunit LDH tumor mitochondrial isozyme MDH one tumor higher control samples lung. contrast, normal fetal lung showed higher LDH-H proportion adult lung mature MDH isozyme pattern. alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase adenylate kinase activities tumors one-tenth one-fourth, respectively, nonneoplastic adult lung. lower activities (evident also normal fetal lung) accompanied 3- 5-fold increases LDH, MDH, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase activities tumors; fetal lungs lesser increases (2- 3-fold) first 3 enzymes. common features tumors different cell types histological grade identified point several enzymes quantitation isozyme analysis may practical use distinguishing cancerous nonneoplastic human lung samples. combination different indicators, opposite changes LDH alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity, coupled elevated proportions LDH-M, may used diagnose neoplasia reliably.
