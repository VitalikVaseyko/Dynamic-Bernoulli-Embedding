 Glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) two major mechanisms involved brain energetics. article propose sporadic forms Alzheimer's disease (AD) driven age-related damage macromolecules organelles results following series dynamic processes. (1) Metabolic alteration: Upregulation OxPhos activity dysfunctional neurons. (2) Natural selection: Competition limited energy substrates neurons normal OxPhos activity [Type (1)] dysfunctional neurons increased OxPhos [Type (2)]. (3) Propagation, due fact Type (1) neurons outcompeted limited substrate Type (2) neurons which, increased ROS production, eventually become dysfunctional die. Otto Warburg, studies origin cancer, discovered cancer cells characterized increase glycolytic activity-a property confers selective advantage oncologic environments. Accordingly, propose term "inverse-Warburg effect" describe increased OxPhos activity--a property propose confers selective advantage neuronal environments, hypothesize underlie shift normal pathological aging subsequent AD.
