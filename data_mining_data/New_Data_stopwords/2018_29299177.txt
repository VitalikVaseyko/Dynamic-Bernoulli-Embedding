 Tumor cell metabolism characterized abundant glucose consumption aerobic glycolysis. pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays decisive role glycolysis, significantly contributing Warburg effect, tumor growth, angiogenesis, cell division, metastasis apoptosis. date, researchers unraveled potential pyruvate kinase M2 antitumor target, suggests new orientation oncotherapy. Herein, focus role pyruvate kinase M2 tumor cell development function potential new therapeutic target tumor treatment. Besides, research actuality pyruvate kinase M2-dependent glycometabolism signaling pathway tumors also summarized, providing valuable suggestions study field.
