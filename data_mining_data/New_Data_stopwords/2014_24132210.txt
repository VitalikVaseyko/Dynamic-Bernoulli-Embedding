 Renal proximal tubule cells spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), compared normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), increased oxidative stress. contribution mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation subsequent hypertensive phenotype remains unclear. found renal proximal tubule cells SHR, relative WKY, significantly higher basal oxygen consumption rates, adenosine triphosphate synthesis-linked oxygen consumption rates, maximum reserve respiration. bioenergetic parameters indicated increased mitochondrial function renal proximal tubule cells SHR compared WKY. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity consistently higher renal proximal tubule cells cortical homogenates SHR WKY. Treatment 6 days dichloroacetate, inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, significantly increased renal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity systolic blood pressure 3-week-old WKY SHR. Therefore, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation higher renal proximal tubule cells SHR compared WKY. Thus, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex determinant increased mitochondrial metabolism could causal contributor hypertension SHR.
