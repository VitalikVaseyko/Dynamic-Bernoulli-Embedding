 Air breathing fish commonly believed arisen adaptation aquatic hypoxia. effectiveness air breathing tissue O2 supply depends ability avoid O2 loss oxygenated blood air-breathing organ passes gills. Here, evaluated whether armoured catfish (Hypostomus aff. pyreneusi)-a facultative air breather-can avoid branchial O2 loss air breathing aquatic hypoxia, measured various respiratory metabolic traits important O2 supply utilization. Fish instrumented opercular catheters measure O2 tension (PO2) expired water, air breathing aquatic respiration measured progressive stepwise hypoxia water. Armoured catfish exhibited relatively low rates O2 consumption gill ventilation, gill ventilation increased hypoxia due primarily increases ventilatory stroke volume. Armoured catfish began air breathing water PO2 2.5 kPa, air-breathing frequency hypoxia tolerance (as reflected PO2 loss equilibrium, LOE) greater individuals larger body mass. Branchial O2 loss, reflected higher PO2 expired inspired water, observed minority (4/11) individuals water PO2 approached LOE. Armoured catfish also exhibited gill morphology characterized short filaments bearing short fused lamellae, large interlamellar cell masses, low surface area, thick epithelium increased water-to-blood diffusion distance. Armoured catfish relatively low blood-O2 binding affinity sampled normoxia (P50 3.1 kPa pH 7.4), able rapidly increase binding affinity progressive hypoxia exposure (to P50 1.8 kPa). Armoured catfish also low activities several metabolic enzymes white muscle, liver, brain. Therefore, low rates metabolism gill ventilation, reduction branchial gas-exchange capacity, may help minimize branchial O2 loss armoured catfish air breathing aquatic hypoxia.
