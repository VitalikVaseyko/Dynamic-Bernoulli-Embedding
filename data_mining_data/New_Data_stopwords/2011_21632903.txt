 Changes sex hormone levels aging illness may lead metabolic disorders. Moreover, ratio changes men versus women may distinct pathological responses. Since little known sex hormone action muscle metabolism, examined role testosterone 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) metabolism investigated whether either hormone may mediate sex-specific effect. Myotubes postmenopausal women age-matched male donors treated 10 nM testosterone E(2) 4 days, assays performed measure metabolic readouts, signal transduction, mRNA expression. Testosterone E(2) treatment enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation glycogen AKT phosphorylation myotubes female donors, highlighting sex-specific role sex hormone glucose metabolism. Testosterone treatment increased palmitate oxidation myotubes female male donors, E(2) enhanced palmitate oxidation myotubes male donors only. Testosterone-mediated increase palmitate oxidation attenuated presence androgen receptor antagonist, may indicate role nuclear steroid receptor muscle lipid oxidation. Testosterone treatment increased mRNA expression insulin receptor substrate 2 myotubes male female donors, whereas increased mRNA expression glycogen synthase 1 myotubes male donors. E(2) treatment increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA expression myotubes female donors. Thus, data suggest testosterone E(2) modulates muscle glucose lipid metabolism may play role metabolism sex-dependent manner.
