 Tumor cell proliferation requires growth signals sufficient cellular bioenergetics. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway seems dominant oncogenic signaling pathway suppressing cell proliferation. study investigated preclinical efficacy targeting tumor bioenergetic pathway using glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) AMPK agonists, AICAR metformin. evaluated vitro antitumor activity 2DG, metformin AICAR alone, 2DG combination either metformin AICAR. examined vivo efficacy using xenograft mouse models. 2DG alone sufficient promote tumor cell death, reflecting limited efficacy showed clinical trials. combined use 2DG AICAR also failed induce cell death. However, 2DG metformin led significant cell death associated decrease cellular ATP, prolonged activation AMPK, sustained autophagy. Gene expression analysis functional assays revealed selective AMPK agonist AICAR augments mitochondrial energy transduction (OXPHOS) whereas metformin compromises OXPHOS. Importantly, forced energy restoration methyl pyruvate reversed cell death induced 2DG metformin, suggesting critical role energetic deprivation underlying mechanism cell death. combination 2DG metformin inhibited tumor growth mouse xenograft models. Deprivation tumor bioenergetics dual inhibition energy pathways might effective novel therapeutic approach broad spectrum human tumors.
