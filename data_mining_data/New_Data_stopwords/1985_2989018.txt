 aspects carbohydrate metabolism investigated three non-malignant, glycogen storing, cell lines derived primary culture rat hepatocytes, Morris hepatoma 3924 cells. three cell lines show biochemical alterations are, large extent, similar found hepatoma cells: increased activity glycolytic enzymes decreased activity gluconeogenetic enzymes. increase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity also found. three cell lines, Morris hepatoma cells, actively convert glucose lactate vitro conditions culture. Fructose taken quickly glucose galactose metabolized. compared normal hepatocytes, three cell lines altered metabolism growth behaviour. largely resemble preneoplastic cells appearing rat liver early stages experimental carcinogenesis.
