 Antibodies purified recombinant PDHKII used ELISAs PDHKII mitochondrial extracts. liver, hyperthyroidism elicited 2.3-fold increase PDHK activity (P < 0.01) accompanied significant 1.5-fold (P < 0.001) increase amount mitochondrial immunoreactive PDHKII. contrast, despite stable 2.0-fold increase cardiac PDHK activity (P < 0.001), amount mitochondrial immunoreactive PDHKII heart unaffected hyperthyroidism. mechanisms long-term regulation PDHK activity thyroid hormones therefore differ fundamentally heart liver.
