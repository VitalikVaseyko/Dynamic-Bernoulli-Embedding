 nucleotide affinity label 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine reacts active site rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, irreversible inactivation occurring concomitant incorporation 1 mol reagent/mol enzyme subunit (Annamalai, A. E., Colman, R. F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10276-10283). Purified peptides isolated 70% inactivated enzyme containing 0.7 mol reagent/mol enzyme subunit. Rabbit muscle enzyme labeled radioactive 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine digested thermolysin. Nucleosidyl peptides purified chromatography phenylboronate-agarose reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. amino acid N-terminal analysis, peptides identified comparison primary sequences chicken cat muscle enzyme. 75% reagent incorporated distributed equally among three O-(4-carboxybenzenesulfonyl)tyrosine-containing peptides: Leu-Asp-CBS-Tyr-Lys-Asn, Val-CBS-Tyr, Leu-Asp-Asn-Ala-CBS-Tyr. tyrosines located 28-residue segment 530-amino acid sequence. remainder incorporation found two N epsilon-(4-carboxybenzenesulfonyl)lysine-containing peptides. Leu-CBS-Lys Ala-CBS-Lys-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Pro. Modification presence MnATP MnADP resulted marked decrease labeling peptides proportion decreased inactivation. suggested modified residues located region catalytically functional nucleotide binding site pyruvate kinase.
