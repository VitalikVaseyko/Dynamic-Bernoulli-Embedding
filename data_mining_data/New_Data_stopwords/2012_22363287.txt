 decade ago, sirtuins discovered highly conserved family NAD(+)-dependent enzymes extend lifespan lower organisms. mammals, sirtuins key regulators stress responses metabolism, influencing range diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, cancer. recent years, new functions sirtuins characterized, uncovering underlying mechanisms multifaceted role metabolism. Here, specifically review recent progress role sirtuins DNA repair energy metabolism, discussing implication sirtuins biology cancer.
