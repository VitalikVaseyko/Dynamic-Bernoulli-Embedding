 AIM: aim study assess impact long-term use composite probiotics patients restorative proctocolectomy. METHOD: Forty-three patients (20 females 23 males, aged 21 68 years) restorative proctocolectomy included study. randomization patients divided placebo group treatment group oral intake probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidus. Patients investigated initial visit final visit 9 months. patients subjected standard clinical endoscopic examination microscopic study specimens. Concentrations calprotectin pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK determined cases. RESULTS: average severity pouchitis number patients pouchitis significantly decrease 9 months probiotic taking. concentrations calprotectin pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK significantly decreased therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Nine months probiotic treatment (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidus) reduced number patients pouchitis, decreased PDAI score, also decreased fecal pyruvate kinase calprotectin. long-term probiotics use safe well accepted effective method pouchitis prevention.
