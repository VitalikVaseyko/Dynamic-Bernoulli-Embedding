 proposed aging results lifelong accumulation intracellular damage via reactions reactive oxygen species (ROS). Metallothioneins conserved cysteine-rich proteins function efficient ROS scavengers may affect longevity. better understand mechanisms controlling metallothionein expression, regulatory factors pathways controlled cadmium-inducible transcription C. elegans metallothionein gene, mtl-1, identified. transcription factor ATF-7 identified ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis candidate gene screens. PMK-1 members insulin signaling pathway, PDK-1 AKT-1/2, also identified mtl-1 regulators. Genetic previous results support model regulation cadmium-inducible mtl-1 transcription based derepression constitutively active transcription factor ELT-2. addition, knockdown mammalian homologs PDK1 ATF7 HEK293 cells resulted changes metallothionein expression, suggesting pathway evolutionarily conserved. insulin signaling pathway known influence aging process; however, various factors responsible affecting aging phenotype unknown. Identification portions insulin signaling pathway regulators metallothionein expression supports hypothesis longevity affected expression efficient ROS scavenger.
