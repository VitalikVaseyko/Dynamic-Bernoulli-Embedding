 Cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) leaves castor oil plant (Ricinus communis L.) purified 3900-fold apparent homogeneity final specific activity 51 mumol pyruvate produced/min/mg protein. PAGE, immunoblot, gel filtration analyses final preparation indicated enzyme alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetramer 250 kDa composed equivalent ratio 57- 56-kDa subunits. enzyme relatively heat-stable displayed broad pH optimum approximately 6.5. However, optimal efficiency substrate utilization [in terms Vmax/Km phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP] occurred pH 7.5. Enzyme activity absolutely dependent upon simultaneous presence bivalent univalent metal cation, Mg2+ K+ fulfilling requirement. Hyperbolic saturation kinetics observed PEP, ADP, K+, whereas Mg2+ binding exhibited positive cooperativity. Mg2 citrate, oxalate, glutamate effective inhibitors pH 7.5. Inhibition compounds pronounced pH 7.5 pH 6.5 yielded additive inhibition tested pairs. Aspartate functioned activator facilitating binding PEP relieving inhibition PKc glutamate. vivo activity leaf PKc probably regulated relative cytosolic levels citrate, glutamate, aspartate. provides possible rationale known activation leaf PKc occurs periods enhanced ammonia assimilation. Together previous studies, results also indicate castor oil plant PKc exists tissue-specific isoforms demonstrate substantial differences respective physical and/or kinetic regulatory properties.
