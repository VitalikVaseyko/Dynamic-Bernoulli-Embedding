 Four new red-cell pyruvate kinase (PK) variants presented along one case so-called classical type PK deficiency. PK 'Tokyo II' low activity, Km (PEP) Vmax, normal urea stability slight deviation normal neutralization tests antiserum. normal nucleotide specificity, abnormal electrophoretic mobility (fast moving) variant associated mild hemolytic anaemia. PK 'Maebashi' low activity, high Km (PEP), low Vmax, urea instability, decreased reactivity antiserum, normal electrophoretic mobility, normal nucleotide specificity associated moderate haemolytic anaemia. PK 'Tsukiji' low activity, high Km (PEP), markedly high Vmax, urea instability, decreased reactivity antiserum, abnormal electrophoretic mobility (fast moving) grossly abnormal nucleotide specificity especially abnormal behaviour ADP. haemolytic process case moderate severe. PK 'Ube' electrophoretically abnormal (fast moving) otherwise normal characteristics propositus healthy anaemic. PK 'Ube' found electrophoretic screening genetic PK polymorphism. classical type PK deficiency, usual red-cell PK (PK-R1 PK-R2) demonstrable electrophoresis instead M2-type PK present, presumably compensatory process. Kinetic studies confirmed patient's red-cell PK consisted M2-type PK. patient severe haemolytic anaemia.
