 new method histochemical demonstration pyruvate kinase (PK) activity developed using semi-permeable membrane ATP-dependent phosphorylation glucose coupled tetrazolium reduction via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) order investigate normal liver tissue neoplastic hepatic nodules induced thioacetamide (TAA). series control reactions comparison microbiochemical analysis microdissected lyophilised material used determine specificity reaction. agreement earlier reports, activity gradient control liver decreasing zone 3 zone 1 apparent histochemically biochemical analysis. Liver neoplastic nodules induced 25 weeks dietary thioacetamide administration characterized increased G6PD demonstrated clear decrease PK activity. contrast, epithelial cells within areas cholangiocellular tumour development characterized strong increase. Comparison results immunohistochemical biochemical data literature indicate specific histochemical method described great assistance future assessment disease physiological alteration activity key enzyme glycolysis.
