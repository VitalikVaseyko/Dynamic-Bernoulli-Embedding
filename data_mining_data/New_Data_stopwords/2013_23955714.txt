 alpha-secretase-mediated cleavage amyloid precursor protein (APP) precludes formation neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, alpha-cleavage cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) prevents conversion misfolded, pathogenic prions (PrP(Sc)). mechanisms leading decreased alpha-secretase activity Alzheimer's prion disease remain unclear. Here, find tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE)-mediated alpha-secretase activity impaired surface neurons infected PrP(Sc) isolated APP-transgenic mice amyloid pathology. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) activity increased neurons infected prions affected Abeta deposition brains individuals Alzheimer's disease. PDK1 induces phosphorylation caveolin-1-mediated internalization TACE. dysregulation TACE increases PrP(Sc) Abeta accumulation reduces shedding TNF-alpha receptor type 1 (TNFR1). Inhibition PDK1 promotes localization TACE plasma membrane, restores TACE-dependent alpha-secretase activity cleavage APP, PrP(C) TNFR1, attenuates PrP(Sc)- Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. mice, inhibition siRNA-mediated silencing PDK1 extends survival reduces motor impairment following PrP(Sc) infection APP-transgenic mice reduces Alzheimer's disease-like pathology memory impairment.
