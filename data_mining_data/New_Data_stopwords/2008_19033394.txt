 Neuroprotein changes spinal cord rodents aliphatic gamma-diketone axonopathy induced 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD) compared reported previously aromatic gamma-diketone-like axonopathy induced 1,2-diacetylbenzene (1,2-DAB). Sprague-Dawley rats treated intraperitoneally 500 mg/kg/day 2,5-HD, equimolar doses 2,3-hexanedione (negative control), equivalent amount saline containing 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle), 5 days week, 3 weeks. Analysis lumbosacral proteome 2-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/tandem mass spectrometry revealed 34 proteins markedly modified 2,5-HD neurofilament triplet L, gelsolin, protein disulfide isomerase, glutathione S-transferase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced) dehydrogenase 1 alpha, pyruvate kinase, fatty acid synthase also modified 1,2-DAB. expression proteins involved maintaining physical integrity cytoskeleton controlling redox protein-folding mechanisms reduced, whereas proteins supporting energy metabolism mainly increased. similarity neuroproteomic patterns 2,5-HD 1,2-DAB axonopathy suggests common biomarkers and/or mechanisms neurotoxicity associated exposure parent chemicals, namely industrial solvents n-hexane 1,2-diethylbenzene, respectively.
