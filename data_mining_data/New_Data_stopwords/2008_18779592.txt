 report engineering Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum, thermophilic anaerobic bacterium ferments xylan biomass-derived sugars, produce ethanol high yield. Knockout genes involved organic acid formation (acetate kinase, phosphate acetyltransferase, L-lactate dehydrogenase) resulted strain able produce ethanol detectable organic product substantial changes electron flow relative wild type. Ethanol formation engineered strain (ALK2) utilizes pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase electrons transferred ferredoxin NAD(P), pathway different previously described microbes homoethanol fermentation. homoethanologenic phenotype stable >150 generations continuous culture. growth rate strain ALK2 similar wild-type strain, reduction cell yield proportional decreased ATP availability resulting acetate kinase inactivation. Glucose xylose co-utilized utilization mannose arabinose commences glucose xylose exhausted. Using strain ALK2 simultaneous hydrolysis fermentation experiments 50 degrees C allows 2.5-fold reduction cellulase loading compared using Saccharomyces cerevisiae 37 degrees C. maximum ethanol titer produced strain ALK2, 37 g/liter, highest reported thus far thermophilic anaerobe, although improvements desired likely possible. results extend frontier metabolic engineering thermophilic hosts, potential significantly lower cost cellulosic ethanol production, support feasibility cost reductions engineering diversity host organisms.
