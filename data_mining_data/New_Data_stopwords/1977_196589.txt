 1. proportion active (dephosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase rat heart mitochondria correlated total concentration ratios ATP/ADP, NADH/NAD+ acetyl-CoA/CoA. metabolites measured ATP-dependent NADH-dependent luciferases. 2. Increase concentration ratio NADH/NAD+ constant [ATP]/[ADP] [acetyl-CoA]/[CoA] associated increased phosphorylation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase. based comparison mitochondria incubated 0.4mM- 1mM-succinate mitochondria incubated 0.4mM-succinate+/-rotenone. 3. Increase concentration ratio acetyl-CoA/CoA constant [ATP]/[ADP] [NADH][NAD+] associated increased phosphorylation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase. based comparison incubations 50 micrometer-palmitotoyl-L-carnitine 250 micrometer-2-oxoglutarate +50 micrometer-L-malate. 4. findings consistent activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase reaction high ratios [NADH]/[NAD+] [acetyl-CoA]/[CoA]. 5. Comparison mitochondria hearts diabetic non-diabetic rats shows phosphorylation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase enhanced alloxan-diabetes factor concentration ratios ATP/ADP, NADH/NAD+ acetyl-CoA/CoA.
