 Individual deletions acs aceA genes E. coli B (BL21) showed little difference metabolite accumulation patterns deletion ackA gene alone together pta showed acetic acid gradually accumulated 3.1 1.7 g/l, respectively, minimal extended lag bacterial growth higher pyruvate formation. Single poxB deletion E. coli B (BL21) additional poxB deletion ackA-pta mutants change acetate accumulation pattern. acetate production genes (ackA-pta-poxB) deleted E. coli B (BL21) acetate still accumulated. may indication perhaps acetate by-product carbon metabolism; possible acetate plays also role cellular metabolite pathways. likely alternative acetate production pathways.
