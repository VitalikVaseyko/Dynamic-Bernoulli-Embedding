 Iodinated [125I] glycolytic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase) bovine serum albumin erythrocyte microinjected scrape loaded confluent 3T3-L1 cells. glycolytic enzymes rapidly (within 30 min) sequestered form inextractable sequential treatments digitonin, Triton X-100 potassium iodide. Bovine serum albumin readily extractable digitonin. Glycolytic enzymes degraded relatively slowly (t1/2's 124-330 h) lysosomal mechanism inhibitable NH4Cl (50-91%), 3-methyl adenine (62-70%) leupeptin (47-80%). Bovine serum albumin degraded relatively rapidly (t1/2 17-20 h) non-lysosomal mechanism. Nycodenz density gradient fractionation homogenates 3T3-L1 cells microinjection shows [125I]-lactate dehydrogenase sediments dense fraction containing nuclei (DNA) lacking cytosolic, lysosomal, plasma membrane mitochondrial marker enzymes. [125I]-enzyme released fraction sequential detergent/salt fractionation described above. Analysis detergent/salt inextractable residue polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis presence sodium dodecyl sulphate 2-mercaptoethanol shows nuclear histones vimentin. [125I]-lactate dehydrogenase enter polyacrylamide gel absence 2-mercaptoethanol. Importantly endogenous proteins found residue presence leupeptin. data suggest sequestration proteins nuclear-intermediate filament fraction may precede lysosomal degradation. Iodinated [125]-Sendai virus HN F membrane glycoproteins reconstituted Sendai virus envelope (RSVE) fused growing HTC cells. HN F rapidly internalised (within 5 h) assume perinuclear distribution lysosomal degradation. HN F proteins either extractable predominantly triton X-100 inextractable treatments described above. Nycodenz fractionation HTC cell homogenates RSVE-cell fusion shows HN F sediment predominantly dense peak, enriched DNA free markers indicated above, less dense peak enriched lysosomal marker enzymes. HN F proteins translocate dense less dense peak degraded lysosomally (t1/2 av. 70 h). Leupeptin slows translocation. detergent/salt inextractable residue enriched nuclear histones vimentin. data suggest Sendai viral membrane glycoproteins sequestered nuclear-intermediate filament fraction lysosomal degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
