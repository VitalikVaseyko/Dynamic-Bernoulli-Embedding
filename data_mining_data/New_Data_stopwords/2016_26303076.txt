 Phosphoryl transfer reactions ubiquitous biology, involved processes ranging energy signal transduction replication genetic material. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (Dha-P), intermediate synthesis pyruvate important building block nature, generated converting free dihydroxyacetone (Dha) action dihydroxyacetone kinase enzyme. paper reference uncatalyzed reaction solution studied order define foundations chemical reaction determine adequate computational method describe electronically complex reaction. particular, phosphorylation reaction mechanism adenosine triphosphate (ATP) Dha aqueous solution studied means quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations QM subset atoms described semi-empirical DFT methods. results appear strongly dependent level calculation, taken account future studies reaction catalyzed enzymes. particular, PM3/MM renders lower free energy barriers less endergonic process AM1d/MM PM6/MM methods. Nevertheless, concerted pathway located former combination potentials.
