 Shear stress potential cause erythrocyte fragmentation hemolysis flowing blood. study, response abnormal human erythrocytes shear stress virto evaluated using concentric cylinder viscometer. Compared normal red cells, deoxygenated erythrocytes persons sicle cell anemia particularly susceptible fragmentation hemolysis shear stress. Oxygenation sicke cell blood improved resistance red cells shear stress; remain, however, susceptible shear stress normal erythrocytes. Erythrocytes patients iron deficiency, thalassemia minor, erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency showed fragmentation hemolysis threshold shear stresses intermediate ovserved blood patients sickle cell anemia normal persons. Blood samples patients hereditary spherocytosis resistant shear stress normal blood. results indicate important differences response various red cells shear stress.
