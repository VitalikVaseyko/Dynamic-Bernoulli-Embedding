 Aldehyde analogues normal alcohol substrates induce ATPase activities glycerokinase (D-glyceraldehyde), fructose-6-phosphate kinase (2,5-anhydromannose 6-phosphate), fructokinase (2,5-anhydromannose 2,5-anhydrotalose), hexokinase (D-gluco-hexodialdose), choline kinase (betaine aldehyde), pyruvate kinase (glyoxylate). Since purified deuterated aldehydes give V V/K isotope effects near 1.0 glycerokinase, fructokinase 2,5-anhydro[1-2H]talose, hexokinase, choline kinase, pyruvate kinase, hydrates almost fully hydrated aldehydes activators ATPase reactions. Fructose-6-phosphate kinase fructokinase 2,5-anhydro[1-2H]mannose show V/K deuterium isotope effects 1.10 1.22, respectively, suggesting either hydrate free aldehyde may activators (predicted values 1.37 free aldehyde activates ATPase) or, likely, phosphorylated hydrate breaks rate-limiting step enzyme MgADP still present back-reaction yield free hydrate solution still possible. 18O transferred aldehyde hydrate phosphate ATPase reactions glycerokinase, fructose-6-phosphate kinase, fructokinase, hexokinase choline kinase pyruvate kinase. Thus, direct phosphorylation hydrates first four enzymes gives phosphate adduct aldehyde, decomposes nonenzymatically, choline kinase pyruvate kinase hydrates induce transfer water (metal-bound hydroxide water pyruvate kinase basis pH profiles). Observation lag release phosphate glycerokinase ATPase reaction 15 degrees C supports existence phosphorylated hydrate intermediate rate constant breakdown 0.035-0.043 s-1 temperature. Kinases phosphorylate creatine, 3-phosphoglycerate, acetate exhibit ATPase activities presence keto aldehyde analogues (N-methylhydantoic acid, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, acetaldehyde, respectively), possibly absence acid-base catalytic group latter two cases. analogues competitive inhibitors vs. normal substrates, latter case, hydrate acetaldehyde shown inhibitory species basis deuterium isotope effect inhibition constant.
