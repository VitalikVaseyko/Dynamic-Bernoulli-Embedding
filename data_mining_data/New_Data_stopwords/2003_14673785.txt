 Expressed proteins antigens Neospora caninum tachyzoites studied two-dimensional gel electrophoresis immunoblot analysis combined matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight mass spectrometry. Thirty-one spots corresponding 20 different proteins identified N. caninum tachyzoites peptide mass fingerprinting. Six proteins identified N. caninum database (NTPase, 14-3-3 protein homologue, NcMIC1, NCDG1, NcGRA1 NcGRA2), 11 proteins identified closely related species using T. gondii database (HSP70, HSP60, pyruvate kinase, tubulin alpha- beta-chain, putative protein disulfide isomerase, enolase, actin, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). One hundred two antigen spots observed using pH 4-7 IPG strips immunoblot profiles. Among them, 17 spots corresponding 11 antigenic proteins identified N. caninum protein map. study involved construction in-depth protein maps N. caninum tachyzoites, value studies pathogenesis, drug vaccine development, phylogenetic studies.
