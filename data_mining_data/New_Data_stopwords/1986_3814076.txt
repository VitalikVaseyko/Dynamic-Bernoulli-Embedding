 Starvation rats 48 h increased activity PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) kinase 2.2-fold extracts liver mitochondria, 2.9-fold PDH complex partially purified therefrom fractional precipitation, 5-fold PDH complex partially purified gel filtration Sephacryl S-300. protein fraction separated PDH complex extracts rat liver mitochondria gel filtration fractional precipitation, increased activity PDH kinase rat liver pig heart PDH complexes. activity protein fraction increased approx. 2.5-fold 48 h starvation rats. highly purified pig heart PDH complex shown protein fraction increased Vmax. PDH kinase reaction 35-fold (fraction fed rats) 82-fold (fraction starved rats); starvation effect concentration protein fraction required give 0.5 Vmax. Evidence given increase PDH kinase activity effected extracts liver mitochondria starvation due increased activity kinase activator protein, tightly bound rat liver PDH complex removed single gel filtration. pig heart PDH complex, increased PDH kinase activity retained gel filtration admixture kinase activator protein starved rats, restored control value second gel filtration; alterations PDH kinase activity associated obvious changes protein bands SDS gels.
