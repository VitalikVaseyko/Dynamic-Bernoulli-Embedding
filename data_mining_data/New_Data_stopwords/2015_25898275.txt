 Cancer cells use glucose glutamine facilitate cell growth proliferation, process coined "metabolic reprograming" - emerging hallmark cancer. Inside cell, nutrients synergize produce metabolic building blocks, nucleic acids, lipids proteins, well energy (ATP), glutathione reducing equivalents (NADPH), required survival, growth proliferation. Intense research aimed understanding underlying cause metabolic rewiring revealed established oncogenes tumor suppressors involved signaling alter cellular metabolism contribute transition normal quiescent cell rapidly proliferating cancer cell. Likewise, bona fide metabolic sensors emerging regulators tumorigenesis. review focus one family sensors, sirtuins, utilize NAD(+) cofactor catalyze deacetylation, deacylation ADP-ribosylation protein substrates. review, enumerate cancer cell metabolism different normal quiescent cell highlight emerging role mitochondrial sirtuin signaling regulation tumor metabolism.
