 well established glucagon stimulate adipose lipolysis, myocardial contractility, hepatic glucose output activating GPCR adenylate cyclase (AC) increasing cAMP production. also widely reported activation AC three tissues requires pharmacological levels hormone, exceeding 0.1 nM. Extensive evidence presented supporting view cAMP mediate metabolic actions glucagon adipose, heart, liver vivo. pharmacological levels stimulate AC, adipose lipolysis, cardiac contractility. Physiological concentrations glucagon (below 0.1 nM) duplicate metabolic effects insulin heart activating PI3K-dependent signal without stimulating AC. liver, glucagon enhance gluconeogenesis glucose output - increasing expression PEPCK inhibiting activity PK - pharmacological concentrations activating AC coupled low-affinity GPCR, also physiological concentrations activating high affinity receptor without generating cAMP. Plausible AC/cAMP-independent signals mediating increase gluconeogenesis include p38 MAPK (PEPCK expression) IP3/DAG/Ca(2+) (PK activity). None glucagon's physiological effects explained activation spare receptors amplification AC/cAMP signal. new model proposed here, glucagon antagonizes insulin liver mimics insulin heart without activating AC. Confirmation model would broad implications, applicable general field metabolic endocrinology also specific role glucagon pathogenesis treatment diabetes.
