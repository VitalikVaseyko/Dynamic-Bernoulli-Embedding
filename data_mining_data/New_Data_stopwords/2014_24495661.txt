 cancer cell metabolism Warburg effect discovery goes back 1924 when, first time Otto Warburg observed, contrast normal cells, cancer cells different metabolism. initiation high throughput technologies computational systems biology, cancer cell metabolism renaissances many attempts performed revise Warburg effect. development experimental analytical tools generate high-throughput biological data including lots information could lead application computational models biological discovery clinical medicine especially cancer. Due recent availability tissue-specific reconstructed models, new opportunities studying metabolic alteration various kinds cancers open up. Structural approaches genome-scale levels seem suitable developing diagnostic prognostic molecular signatures, well identifying new drug targets. review, considered recent advances structural-based analysis cancer metabolic disease view. Two different structural approaches described here: topological constraint-based methods. ultimate goal type systems analysis discovery novel drug targets also development new systems-based therapy strategies.
