 BACKGROUND: Erythrocytes individuals pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) resistant invasion Plasmodium falciparum parasites, erythrocytes infected ring-stage parasites preferentially cleared macrophages vitro. However, underlying molecular basis protection unknown. present study, examined adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels PKD erythrocytes (ie, erythrocytes individuals PKD) determined whether depletion ATP normal erythrocytes would recapitulate phenotype observed PKD. METHODS: examined ATP levels homozygous PKLR(-/-) heterozygous PKLR(+/-) human erythrocytes used sodium fluoride treatment inhibit ATP generation normal human erythrocytes. RESULTS: demonstrated ATP levels reduced PKLR(-/-) (percentage control erythrocytes, 26%; interquartile range [IQR], 21%-48%) PKLR(+/-) erythrocytes (percentage control erythrocytes, 64%; IQR, 60%-73%) correlation ATP levels erythrocytes inhibition parasite invasion enhancement phagocytosis erythrocytes infected ring-stage parasites. Analysis ATP distribution parasitized erythrocytes demonstrated parasites invading PKD erythrocytes respond low intraerythrocytic ATP levels means parallel increase parasite-derived ATP via up-regulation P. falciparum-specific pyruvate kinase. CONCLUSION: data suggest reduced erythrocyte ATP levels may contribute protection displayed PKD erythrocytes vitro may provide model system define molecular basis protection inherited PKD.
