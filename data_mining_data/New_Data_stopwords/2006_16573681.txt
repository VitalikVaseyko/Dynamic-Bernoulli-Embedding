 interconversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate represents important control point Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway Bacteria Eucarya, little known site regulation Archaea. report coexistence phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEPS) first described archaeal pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (PPDK), which, besides pyruvate kinase (PK), involved catalysis reaction hyperthermophilic crenarchaeote Thermoproteus tenax. genes encoding T. tenax PEPS PPDK cloned expressed Escherichia coli, enzymic regulatory properties recombinant gene products analysed. Whereas PEPS catalyses unidirectional conversion pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate, PPDK shows bidirectional activity preference catabolic reaction. contrast PK T. tenax, regulated transcript level exhibits limited regulatory potential protein level, PEPS PPDK activities modulated adenosine phosphates intermediates carbohydrate metabolism. Additionally, expression PEPS regulated transcript level response offered carbon source revealed Northern blot analyses. combined action differently regulated enzymes PEPS, PPDK PK represents novel way controlling interconversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate reversible EMP pathway, allowing short-term long-term adaptation different trophic conditions. Comparative genomic analyses indicate coexistence PEPS, PPDK PK Archaea well, suggesting similar regulation carbohydrate metabolism organisms.
