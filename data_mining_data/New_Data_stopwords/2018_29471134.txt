 precise coupling spatially separated intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-producing ATP-consuming, catalyzed creatine kinase (CK), adenylate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK), critical process bioenergetics tissues high energy demand, branchial tissue. effects Citrobacter freundii infection gills remain poorly understood, limited histopathological studies. Thus, aim study evaluate whether experimental infection C. freundii impairs enzymes phosphoryl transfer network gills silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). CK (cytosolic mitochondrial) AK activities decreased infected compared uninfected animals, PK activity differ groups. gill histopathology infected animals revealed extensive degeneration fusion necrosis secondary lamellae, detachment superficial epithelium, aneurysm, vessel congestion inflammatory process. Based evidences, inhibition absence efficient communication CK compartments caused impairment branchial bioenergetics homeostasis, compensated augmentation branchial AK activity attempt restore energy homeostasis. summary, alterations contribute disease pathogenesis linked branchial tissue animals infected C. freundii.
