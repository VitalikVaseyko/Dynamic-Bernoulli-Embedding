 use single-cell quantitative RT-PCR greatly aided study gene expression fields muscle physiology. study, hypothesized single muscle fibers biopsy placed directly reverse transcription buffer gene expression data obtained without first extract RNA. test hypothesis, biopsies taken vastus lateralis five male subjects. Single muscle fibers isolated underwent RNA isolation (technique 1) placed directly reverse transcription buffer (technique 2). cDNA conversion, individual fiber cDNA pooled quantitative PCR performed using primer-probes beta(2)-microglobulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, insulin-like growth factor receptor, glucose transporter subtype 4. RNA extraction method provided similar quantitative PCR data RNA extraction method. third technique also tested used one-quarter individual fiber's cDNA PCR (not pooled) average coefficient variation fibers <8% (cycle threshold value) genes studied. RNA extraction technique tested isolated muscle fibers using gene known increase exercise (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4). observed 13.9-fold change expression resistance exercise, consistent previously observed. results demonstrate successful method gene expression analysis directly single muscle fibers.
