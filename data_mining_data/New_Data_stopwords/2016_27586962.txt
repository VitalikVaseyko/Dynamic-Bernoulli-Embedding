 (-)-Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) suppresses fatty acid synthesis animals, biochemical mechanism poultry unclear. study identified key proteins associated fat metabolism elucidated biochemical mechanism (-)-HCA broiler chickens. Four groups (n = 30 each) received diet supplemented 0, 1000, 2000 3000 mg/kg (-)-HCA 4 weeks. differentially expressed liver proteins, 40 26 identified mitochondrial cytoplasm respectively. Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 components (PDHA1 PDHB), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD), aconitase (ACO2), a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (DLST), enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1) phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) upregulated, NADP-dependent malic enzyme (ME1) downregulated. Biological network analysis showed identified proteins involved glycometabolism lipid metabolism, whereas PDHA1, PDHB, ECHS1, ME1 identified canonical pathway Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. data indicated (-)-HCA inhibited fatty acid synthesis reducing acetyl-CoA supply, via promotion tricarboxylic acid cycle (upregulation PDHA1, PDHB, ACO2, DLST expression) inhibition ME1 expression. Moreover, (-)-HCA promoted fatty acid beta-oxidation upregulating ECHS1 expression. results reflect biochemically relevant mechanism fat reduction (-)-HCA broiler chickens.
