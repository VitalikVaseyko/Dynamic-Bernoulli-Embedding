 Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) well-established regulator several essential cellular processes. Here, report route activated PKB promotes survival response DNA insults vivo. PKB activation following DNA damage requires 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Active PKB localizes nucleus gamma-irradiated cells adjacent DNA double-strand breaks, colocalizes interacts DNA-PK. Levels active PKB inversely correlate DNA damage-induced apoptosis. significant portion p53- DNA damage-regulated genes misregulated cells lacking PKBalpha. PKBalpha knockout mice show impaired DNA damage-dependent induction p21 increased tissue apoptosis single-dose whole-body irradiation. findings place PKB downstream DNA-PK DNA damage response signaling cascade, provides prosurvival signal, particular affecting transcriptional p21 regulation. Furthermore, function apparently restricted PKBalpha isoform.
