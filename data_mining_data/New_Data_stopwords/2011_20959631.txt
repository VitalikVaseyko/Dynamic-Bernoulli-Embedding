 Akt signalling pathway plays vital roles controlling cellular responses insulin well proliferation survival. Inhibition Akt signalling leads insulin resistance type 2 diabetes, whereas hyperactivation Akt promotes tumorigenesis. study, investigate modest changes activity Akt signalling pathway, extent might achieved drug treatment, would impact insulin resistance tumorigenesis. Using insulin-resistant PDK1(K465E/K465E) PH domain knock-in mice, found introducing PTEN(+/-) mutation slightly stimulate Akt restored normal insulin sensitivity. Introducing PDK1(K465E/K465E) PH domain knock-in mutation cancer-prone PTEN(+/-) mice, lowered Akt activity 50%, led delay tumour onset approximately 4 months broad range tumours. also accompanied slower growth B cell follicular lymphomas, monitored magnetic resonance imaging. findings imply signal transduction inhibitors lead modest reduction Akt activity would delay onset tumours possessing elevated phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway activity would also reduce growth rate developed tumours.
