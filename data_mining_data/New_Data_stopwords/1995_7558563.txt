 Setaria digitata, cattle filarial parasite, similar human filarial parasites, possesses significant activities 4 transhydrogenases namely NADH-NAD+, NADPH-NAD+, NADH-NADP+, NADPH-NADP+ sonicated mitochondria like particles. transhydrogenases appear regulate metabolic pathways parasite response presence adenyl nucleotides non-energy linked. Observations transhydrogenase fumarate reductase activities show existence protein bound NAD MLP linkage fumarate reductase system malic enzyme transhydrogenases. malate dismutation reaction result malic fumarase enzyme activities. Fumarase fumarate reductase activities result succinate formation anaerobic conditions showing major energy production fumarate reductase site. existence acetate kinase, phosphotransacetylase, pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl CoA carboxylase CoA transferase enzymes mitochondrial system shows presence energy producing sites parasite. transhydrogenase system, NAD+/NADP+ malic enzyme, fumarase fumarate reductase key enzymes of, production reducing power synthetic reactions regulation oxidative reductive stages mitochondrial system. Hence, specific drugs targeted interconnected complex enzyme system, effective control filarial parasites.
