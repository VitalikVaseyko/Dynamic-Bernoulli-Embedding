 Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) common metabolic disease often complicated number pathological conditions among haematological changes alterations blood cell function. Human feline diabetes mellitus patients reported associated oxidative stress lead membrane alterations reduced erythrocyte life-span. Erythrocyte function dogs affected IDDM investigated insulin therapy, paying attention antioxidant status, membrane resistance, enzyme activities 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG) concentration. Thirteen diabetic 36 healthy dogs bled haematology blood chemistry assays performed evaluate degree compensation. Osmotic fragility, activities enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) pyruvate-kinase (PK) concentrations reduced glutathione (GSH) 2,3DPG evaluated erythrocytes. Diabetic dogs differ controls terms haematological parameters, except higher numbers platelets. Higher values fructosamine, glucose, protein, plasma potassium calculated osmolality detected plasma diabetic dogs. differences detected osmotic fragility, GSH concentration PK activity two groups 2,3DPG concentration G6PD activity statistically significantly higher diabetic group. results indicate minimal alterations erythrocyte functions occur insulin-treated diabetic dogs. contrasts reported IDDM humans cats.
