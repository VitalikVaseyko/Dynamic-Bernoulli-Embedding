 Reduced endothelial-pericyte interactions linked progressive small vessel loss pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), molecular mechanisms underlying disease remain poorly understood. identify relevant gene candidates associated aberrant pericyte behavior, performed transcriptome analysis patient-derived donor control PAH lung pericytes followed functional genomics analysis. Compared donor control cells, PAH pericytes significant enrichment genes involved various metabolic processes, top hit PDK4, gene coding enzyme suppresses mitochondrial activity favor glycolysis. Given reports link reduced mitochondrial activity increased PAH cell proliferation, hypothesized increased PDK4 associated PAH pericyte hyperproliferation reduced endothelial-pericyte interactions. found PDK4 gene protein expression significantly elevated PAH pericytes correlated reduced mitochondrial metabolism, higher rates glycolysis, hyperproliferation. Importantly, reducing PDK4 levels restored mitochondrial metabolism, reduced cell proliferation, improved endothelial-pericyte interactions. knowledge, first study documents significant differences gene expression human donor control PAH lung pericytes link mitochondrial dysfunction aberrant endothelial-pericyte interactions PAH. Comprehensive characterization candidate genes could provide novel therapeutic targets improve endothelial-pericyte interactions prevent small vessel loss PAH.
