 Osteosarcoma (OS) mostly diagnosed primary bone malignancy. Emerging evidence indicates activity pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform crucial survival tumor cells. present study, effect PKM2 knockdown proliferation migration OS cells assessed vitro vivo. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology employed suppress expression PKM2 MG-63 Saos-2 cell lines. vitro, shRNA-mediated knockdown PKM2 efficiently inhibited cell proliferation, induced G1 cell cycle arrest apoptosis cell lines, associated decreased expressions cyclin D1 Bcl-2 well increased expressions Bax, cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-PARP. invasion migration potential OS cell lines also inhibited PKM2 knockdown regulating effect PKM2 MMP-2 VEGF signaling. vivo, knockdown PKM2 decelerated tumor growth rate induced structure deterioration tumor tissues. current study first time showed activity PKM2 indispensable development metastasis OS, thereby providing basic information future development PKM2-based anti-OS therapies.
