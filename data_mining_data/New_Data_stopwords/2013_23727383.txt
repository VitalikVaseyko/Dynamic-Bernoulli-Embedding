 Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) involved various cellular processes, cell proliferation, differentiation apoptosis. adipocyte differentiation plays critical role obesity development, present study investigated effect Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol differentiation 3T3-L1 preadipocytes potential mechanisms. cells treated different concentrations radicicol first 8days cell differentiation. Adipogenesis, expression adipogenic transcriptional factors, differentiation makers cell cycle determined. found radicicol dose-dependently decreased intracellular fat accumulation down-regulating expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) CCAAT element binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), fatty acid synthase (FAS) fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4). Flow cytometry analysis revealed radicicol blocked cell cycle G1-S phase. Radicicol redcued phosphorylation Akt showing effect beta-catenin expression. Radicicol decreased phosphorylation phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). results suggest radicicol inhibited 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation affecting PDK1/Akt pathway subsequent inhibition mitotic clonal expansion expression/activity adipogenic transcriptional factors downstream adipogenic proteins.
