 Human pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD), autosomal recessive disorder produced mutations PKLR gene, common cause chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Transduction wild-type erythroid (R-type) pyruvate kinase (RPK) cDNA deficient hematopoietic stem cells could potential use rescue therapy severe clinical cases. study, gammaretroviral vectors expressing human RPK designed possible gene therapy candidates disease. real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, flow cytometric analysis, demonstrate stable RPK expression undifferentiated differentiated murine erythroleukemia cells. vitro assay, proportion transduced cells intensity expression transgene remained unaltered 6 months culture. Moreover, transplanting human RPK-transduced Lin(-)Sca-1(+) mouse cells myeloablated primary secondary recipients rendered high proportions erythroid precursors mature erythrocytes expressing RPK, without inducing hematopoietic effects. findings suggest retroviral vectors could useful delivery expression RPK erythroid cells, provide evidence potential use gene therapy strategies phenotypically correct erythroid PKD.
