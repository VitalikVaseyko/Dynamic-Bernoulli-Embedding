 effects synthetic preparations exhibiting cytokinin-like activity (6-benzylaminopurine, Thidiazuron, kartolin-2) specific leaf area (SLA) studied plants family Gramineae (wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; meadow fescue, Festuca pratensis Huds.; reed fescue, F. arindinacea Schreb.). early stages ontogeny (until leaf area reached 50-60% maximum value), treatment plants three species cytokinin-like preparations caused increase SLA. SLA value plants correlated rate photosynthetic assimilation carbon dioxide activities carbon metabolism enzymes: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39), NAD-malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), NADP-glyceraldehydrophosphate dehydrogenase complex, includes phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3) glyceraldehydrophosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.13). However, correlation SLA activity phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31), anaplerotic carboxylation enzyme grasses. SLA suggested reflect state activity photosynthetic apparatus recommended characteristic photosynthesis variability (e.g., caused cytokinin-like preparations).
