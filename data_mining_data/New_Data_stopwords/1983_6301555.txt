 consequence complexity metabolic network amount control strength adenine nucleotide translocator investigated isolated rat liver mitochondria. Two experimental systems compared: (i) mitochondria presence yeast hexokinase (hexokinase system) (ii) system plus additional pyruvate kinase (pyruvate kinase system). systems control strength analysed adenine nucleotide translocator inhibitor titration studies carboxyatractyloside hexokinase pyruvate kinase changing relative activities. Experimental results compared computer simulation systems third one, extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio held constant perifusion (perifusion system). results demonstrate quite different flux-dependent control strength translocator three systems. hexokinase system control strength translocator mitochondrial respiration zero respiration rates 60 nmol O2/mg protein per min. higher rates, control strength increased maximum value (0.45) reached fully active state. Here, value also found pyruvate kinase system. states respiration translocator exerts higher control strength pyruvate kinase system hexokinase system. different behaviour attributed various changes adenine nucleotide pattern caused partial inhibition translocator hexokinase pyruvate kinase system. data clearly show sharing control strength depends respiration rate also complexity metabolic system.
