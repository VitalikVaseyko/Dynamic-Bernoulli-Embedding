 increase incorporation amino acids protein vitro preparations obtained protein-fed rats compared preparations obtained carbohydrate-fed rats described previously. molecular sieving Sephadex G-25 cell-free preparations, difference incorporating activity two types rats diminished systems containing ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, GTP, mixture amino acids. When, molecular sieving, mitochondrial (15,000 g) supernatant incubated 4 min 35 degrees C polysomal pattern preparations unchanged. presence ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase polysomal incorporating activity low polysomal pattern slightly changed. Addition GTP increased activity markedly, pronounced activity observed mixture amino acids added well. amino acid incorporation ability increased, monosomes formed polyribosomes. activity polyribosomes severalfold higher non-Sephadex-treated preparations, indicating activation polysomal aggregates usually applied conditions incubation prior molecular sieving show little insignificant activity. possible activate polyribosomes carbohydrate-fed protein-fed rats almost extent.
