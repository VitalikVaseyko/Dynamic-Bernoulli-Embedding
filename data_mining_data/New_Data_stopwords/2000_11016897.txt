 dynamic perifusion, 20 mmol/L glucose, 20 mmol/L alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) 20 mmol/L methyl pyruvate (MP) stimulate biphasic insulin secretory responses collagenase-isolated rat islets. Peak first-phase insulin responses comparable 3 nutrient agonists. largest second-phase insulin secretory response evoked 20 mmol/L glucose (30-fold basal release rates), response sustained observed either 20 mmol/L KIC 20 mmol/L MP. mouse islets perifused similar conditions, KIC stimulated largest first-phase insulin response, comparable acute insulin secretion rates obtained glucose- MP-stimulated islets. contrast rat islets, sustained second phase insulin secretion mouse islets minimal regardless nutrient secretagogue used. anomalous response mouse islets compared rat islets could ascribed obvious difference glucose usage rate insulin content 2 species. Glucose, KIC, MP stimulated significant increases 3H-inositol phosphates rat islets. Significantly smaller increases measured mouse islets. Comparative Western blot analyses showed pronounced species differences expression phospholipase Cbeta1 (PLCbeta1), PLCbeta2, PLCbeta3, PLCdelta1 PLCgamma1 protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) rat mouse islets. PLCbeta4 PLCdelta2 could identified either species. findings consistent concept underexpression nutrient-activated PLC isozyme may account minimal inositol phosphate (IP) second-phase insulin secretory response mouse islets.
