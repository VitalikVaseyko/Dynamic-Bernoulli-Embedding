 effect ascorbic acid key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism e.g. hexokinases, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase malic enzyme determined regenerating mouse liver. enzymes showed significant increase activity regeneration. Ascorbic acid reduced activities enzymes regenerating liver. decrease liver weight ascorbic acid treated animals may correlated effect enzymes glycolytic pathway main source energy required dividing cells.
