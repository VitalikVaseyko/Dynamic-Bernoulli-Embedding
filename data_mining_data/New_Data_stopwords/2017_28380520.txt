 study evaluate effects supplementation AA form (crystalline vs. protein bound) low-protein diets growth, metabolic, immunological characteristics pigs. total 80 barrows (PIC 327 x 1050; 15.57 +/- 0.13 kg BW 48 +/- 2 age), housed 4 pigs per pen 5 pens per treatment, assigned 4 dietary treatments 17, 15, 13% CP 13% CP plus casein 28 d. crystalline AA supplemented meet requirement indispensable AA pigs. Results showed pigs fed 13% CP diet 13% CP plus casein diet lower ( < 0.01) ADG ADFI greater ( < 0.01) feed:gain ratio pigs fed 17% CP 15% CP diets 4-wk study period. Compared diets, pigs fed 13% CP diet decreased concentrations plasma urea nitrogen, albumin ( < 0.01), mRNA expressions Toll-like receptor 4 (), nuclear factor kappa B (; < 0.05), Toll-interacting protein (; < 0.01) ileum also increased activity plasma glutamate-pyruvate transaminase ( < 0.05) concentrations IL-1beta ( < 0.05) tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( < 0.01); however, characteristics partly normalized feeding 13% CP plus casein diet. Furthermore, plasma concentration insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; < 0.01) mRNA expressions protein kinase B (), mammalian target rapamycin (), ribosomal protein S6 kinase () longissimus muscle increased ( < 0.05) pigs fed 13% CP plus casein diet relative pigs fed 17% CP 15% CP diets. summary, reducing dietary CP level 17% 15% effect growth, metabolic, immunological characteristics 15- 35-kg pigs. reduction dietary CP level 13% would lead poor growth performance, metabolic immunological characteristics partly normalized using protein-bound AA replace synthesized AA 13% CP diet.
