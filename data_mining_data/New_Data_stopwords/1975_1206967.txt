 Pyruvate kinase activity red blood cell membranes, normally masked, determined mechanical disruption membranes normal individuals three homozygous patients pyruvate kinase deficiency. Although patients 1 2, siblings, relatively high enzyme activities hemolysates, severest form disorder. activities membrane fragments decreased seven per cent fragments normal membranes. Patient 3 mild form hemolytic anemia despite low enzyme activity hemolysates. membrane fragments patient contained 28 per cent pyruvate kinase activity normal fragments. data suggest relationship amount membrane-localized pyruvate kinase severity clinical disorder. reduced production ATP enzyme portion localized within membrane may cause impairment membrane functions pyruvate kinase deficiency.
