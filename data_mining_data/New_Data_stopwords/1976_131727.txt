 Specimens human adipose tissue cultured one week without addition insulin. basal well noradenaline-stimulated lipolysis enhanced explants cultured insulin, showing long-term effect hormone lipolytic. However, acute antilipolytic effect insulin could demonstrated explants subsequent short-term incubations. basal rate glucose incorporation lipids enhanced explants cultured insulin. insulin added short-term incubations explants respond hormone case explants cultured without insulin. Thus, seems prolonged exposure insulin leads diminished acute effect hormone glucose metabolism. However, explants responded antilipolytic effect showing insulin able bind membrane. activities hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphage dehydrogenase (G6PDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased large fat cells freshly excised tissue cultured explants. However, activity phosphofructokinase (PFK) correlate cell size. presence insulin culture period enhanced activities G7PDH, PK, LDH, found HK PFK. data thus suggest metabolic capacity human fat cells enhanced long-term exposure insulin. Although enzyme induction could shown G6PDH, PK LDH seems unlikely importance increased rates glucose metabolism explants since rate-limiting enzymes, HK PGK, increased. probably, then, stimulating effect insulin exerted membrane rate glucose transport.
