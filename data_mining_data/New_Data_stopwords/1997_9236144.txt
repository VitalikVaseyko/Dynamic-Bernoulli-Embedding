 Using isolated ferret heart preparation (Langendorff perfusion, perfusion pressure 90 mmHg), energy metabolism characterized right left ventricles control hypertrophied hearts. Hypertrophy induced pulmonary artery clipping 30-45 days (right ventricle wall weight/body weight ratio increased 70%). Myocardial contents high energy phosphate compounds, glycogen lactate, activities enzymes biochemically measured perfused hearts also ischemic arrest (30 min global ischemia). hypertrophied right ventricles, PCr (-46%), Cr (-34%) levels, creatine kinase activity (-18%) significantly decreased compared control. ATP Pi levels affected hypertrophy. adenylate energy charges similar (0.85-0.86) types heart. activities hexokinase (+26%), aldolase (+212%), pyruvate kinase (+14%) glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (+107%) increased hypertrophy. LDH isozyme pattern significantly changed LDH3 decreased 11%, LDH4 LDH5 increased factor 1.4 2.9 respectively hypertrophy. 30 min global ischemia, PCr level decreased 89 79% control hypertrophied ventricles respectively. ATP level depressed 41 control 21% hypertrophied muscles. Altogether, present data suggested that, adult ferret heart, capacity ATP synthesis could maintained hypertrophy enhancement glycolytic pathway. smaller decline ATP ischemia hypertrophied tissue could explained lower consumption ATP hypertrophied compared control heart earliest period ischemia.
