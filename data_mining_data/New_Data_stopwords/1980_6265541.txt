 present investigations rat lung show metabolic changes occurring around 20th gestational day accompanied multiple alterations quantitative pattern enzymes. involves increases two lysosomal enzymes (N-acetyl beta-glucosaminidase beta-galactosidase) rise fall pyruvate kinase alpha-glucosidase. striking transient upsurge adenylate kinase, however, postponed birth. normal diminution thymidine kinase peptidylproline hydroxylase drastically enhanced injection cortisol fetal rats. Studies human pulmonary tissues consisted determining enzyme concentration ninth 21st week gestation histologically normal adult lungs. results show 15th 21st week gestation period increase pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase alpha-glucosidase. rise development several enzymes (e.g., 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) decline thymidine kinase peptidylproline hydroxylase, however, dose begin 21st week gestation.
