 requirements vitro mitochondrial protein synthesis studied using isolated mitochondria cultured adrenal Y-1 tumor cells mice. reducing reaction volume 50 microliter able assay replicate requirements various reaction components using trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable counts quantitative evaluation time incubation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed autoradiography also used qualitative quantitative evaluation translation products. optimized system, 1 3% added [35S]methionine incorporated. products mitochondrial protein synthesis range 70,000 5000 molecular weight. Major autoradiographic bands observed 38,000, 31,000, 23,000, 20,000, 5600 molecular weight separated 10 20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels; however, 20 30 protein products various molecular weights discernible. Mitochondrial concentrations 0.8 1.4 mg/ml incubation gave better incorporation [35S]methionine per milligram protein. Total [35S]methionine incorporated mitochondrial protein greatest 25 degrees C 90 min. Chloramphenicol 10 micrograms/ml inhibited mitochondrial protein synthesis 50% 100 micrograms/ml inhibited incorporation 95%. Cycloheximide effect incorporation less 1.0 mg/ml. Magnesium ATP molar ratio one one 5 mM gave optimal incorporation. energy generating systems using oxidative phosphorylation supply ATP protein synthesis effective ATP 5 mM phosphoenol pyruvate, 20 micrograms/ml pyruvate kinase 5 mM a-ketoglutarate. contrast vitro yeast mitochondrial protein synthesis, enhancement vitro adrenal cell mitochondrial protein synthesis found GTP analogs. buffers N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine, N-(tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl)glycine, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid superior Tris-HCl mitochondrial protein synthesis. Optimal pH [35S]methionine incorporation mitochondrial proteins pH 7.0 7.6. Potassium 50 90 mM gave best incorporation [35S]methionine, higher molecular weight products translation enhanced concentrations. Sodium 10 40 mM effect; however, 100 mM sodium inhibited label incorporation 30%. Calcium 100 microM inhibited mitochondrial protein synthesis approximately 50%, 1.0 mM little incorporation occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
