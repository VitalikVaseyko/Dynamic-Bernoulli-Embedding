 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex purified mitochondria cauliflower, Brassica oleracea var. botrytis floral buds specific activity 5.4 mumol NADH/min per mg protein. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex required CoASH, NAD+, thiamine pyrophosphate Mg2+ oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate. kinetic analysis complex gave series parallel lines substrates. Product interaction patterns showed NADH competitive NAD+; acetyl-CoA competitive CoASH; NADH acetyl-CoA uncompetitive pyruvate. kinetic patterns suggest multisite ping-pong mechanism described Cleveland ((1973) J. Biol. Chem 248, 8353). noncompetitive inhibition NADH versus CoASH, acetyl-CoASH versus NAD predicted mechanism. Regulation complex sensitive NADH/NAD+ ratio acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio. Hydroxypyruvate glyoxylate inhibited complex noncompetitively versus pyruvate. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex inactivated phosphorylated ATP. ATP dependent inactivation believed enzyme catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase complex kinase. However, evidence found plant pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphatase. results suggest cauliflower pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism.
