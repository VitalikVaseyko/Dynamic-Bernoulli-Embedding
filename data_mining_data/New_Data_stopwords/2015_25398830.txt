 Normal tissue toxicity markedly reduces therapeutic index genotoxic anticancer agents, including ionizing radiation. Countermeasures tissue damage caused radiation limited potential also protect malignant cells tissues. Here, tested panel signal transduction modifiers selective radioprotection normal tumor tissues. included three inhibitors GSK3 (LiCl, SB216763, SB415286) two inhibitors NF-kappaB (ethyl pyruvate RTA 408). Among these, thiol-reactive triterpenoid RTA 408 emerged robust effective protector multiple organ systems (gastrointestinal, skin, hemopoietic) lethal doses radiation. RTA 408 preserved survival proliferation intestinal crypt cells lethally irradiated mice reducing apoptosis incidence crypts villi. contrast, RTA 408 uniformly inhibited growth established CWR22Rv1, LNCaP/C4-2B, PC3, DU145 xenografts either alone combined radiation. Antitumor effects vivo associated reduced proliferation intratumoral apoptosis inhibition NF-kappaB-dependent transcription PC3 cells. Selective protection normal tissue compartments RTA 408 critically depended tissue context could replicated vitro. Collectively, data highlight potential RTA 408 cytoprotective agent may safely used chemoradiation approaches.
