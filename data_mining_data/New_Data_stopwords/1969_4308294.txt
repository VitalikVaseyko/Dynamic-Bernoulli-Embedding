 1. effects ATP, PP(i) EDTA skeletal-muscle pyruvate kinase reaction various concentrations magnesium (where ;magnesium' refers total Mg(2+), free form complexes) investigated. reaction rate determined amount pyruvate formed recorded time incubation. 2. 44mm-magnesium K(m) values ADP phosphoenolpyruvate unaltered presence ATP 6.8mm systems buffered either tris-hydrochloric acid glycylglycine-sodium hydroxide, K(m) values different systems. K(m) one substrate independent concentration second substrate. 3. 10mm-magnesium tris-hydrochloric acid system ATP inhibited reaction competitively respect ADP phosphoenolpyruvate. glycylglycine-sodium hydroxide system inhibition appeared non-competitive. 10mm-magnesium K(m) values lower 44mm-magnesium dependent system used. 4. tris-hydrochloric acid system reaction rate rose increasing magnesium concentration maximum concentration 10-20 times ADP. increase inhibited reaction 44mm-magnesium rate 25-50% maximum. inhibition paralleled produced increasing trimethylammonium chloride concentrations due specific effect Mg(2+) ion. 5. presence 6.8mm-ATP reaction occurred 4-6mm-magnesium, increase apparently abolished inhibition reaction rate increased became equal obtained absence ATP 10-25mm-magnesium. increase magnesium concentration gave reaction rates slightly higher presence ATP absence. maximal rate presence ATP distinctly lower absence. 6.8mm-PP(i) 6.8mm-EDTA present variations reaction rate rising magnesium concentration similar obtained presence ATP 6-8mm-magnesium increase magnesium concentration resulted increase rate maximum comparable control. effect pure chelation thus displacement reaction maximum higher magnesium concentrations without changing maximal rate. correction made effect, ATP gave inhibition 44mm-magnesium competitive respect ADP (K(i) 2.1x10(-2)m). degree inhibition far less reported earlier importance mechanism pyruvate kinase reaction discussed.
