 Employing non-recirculating perfused rat liver preparation, investigated regulation hepatic gluconeogenesis, metabolic fluxes tricarboxylic acid cycle 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction epidermal growth factor (EGF) mimics actions insulin Ca(2+)-mobilizing hormones (e.g. vasopressin). monitored rate 14CO2 production [2-14C]pyruvate (0.5 mM), EGF (10 nM) transiently stimulated activity tricarboxylic acid cycle. EGF also transiently stimulated hepatic gluconeogenesis pyruvate. transient stimulation tricarboxylic acid cycle activity gluconeogenesis accompanied increase perfusate Ca2+ content indicating EGF also altered hepatic Ca2+ fluxes. EGF-elicited stimulation gluconeogenesis was, least part, result transient (50%) inhibition pyruvate kinase activity. Likewise, EGF-mediated stimulation tricarboxylic acid cycle activity can, part, attributed EGF-elicited stimulation metabolic flux mitochondrial, Ca(2+)-sensitive, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction. regulation hepatic metabolism EGF appears manifestation alteration cellular Ca2+ content since experiments performed conditions known abolish ability EGF alter cytosolic free-Ca2+ concentrations, i.e. livers pertussis-toxin-treated rats, EGF alter either perfusate Ca2+ content metabolic parameters monitored. Additionally, experiments involving pulsatile infusion either EGF phenylephrine livers demonstrated that, unlike alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, homologous desensitization EGF receptor occurs. homologous desensitization EGF receptor explain transient nature EGF-elicited stimulation various metabolic processes. Since protein kinase C activation EGF lead receptor desensitization, experiments performed phorbol esters either activate alter protein kinase C activity. inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate modulate hepatic actions EGF, activation protein kinase C 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (70 nM) abolished ability EGF stimulate gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle activity metabolic flux 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex.
