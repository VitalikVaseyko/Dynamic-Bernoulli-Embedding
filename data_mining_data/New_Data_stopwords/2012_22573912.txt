 Energy production mitochondria multistep process requires coordination several subsystems. reversible phosphorylation emerging principal tool, still unclear signal network senses workloads processes different fuel procurement, catabolism Krebs cycle, stepwise oxidation reducing equivalents electron transfer chain. previously proposed mitochondria use oxidized cytochrome c concert retinol activate protein kinase Cdelta, thereby linking prominent kinase network redox balance ETC. Here, show activation PKCepsilon mitochondria also requires retinol cofactor, implying redox-mechanism. Whereas activated PKCdelta transmits stimulatory signal pyruvate dehdyrogenase complex (PDHC), PKCepsilon opposes signal inhibits PDHC. results suggest balance PKCdelta epsilon paramount importance flux fuel entering Krebs cycle overall energy homeostasis. observed synthetic retinoid fenretinide substituted retinol cofactor function but, chronic use, distorted signal balance, leading predominance PKCepsilon PKCdelta. suppression PDHC might explain proapoptotic effect fenretinide tumor cells, well diminished adiposity observed experimental animals humans. Furthermore, disturbed balance PKCdelta PKCepsilon might underlie injury inflicted ischemic myocardium reperfusion. dehydrogenase complex.
