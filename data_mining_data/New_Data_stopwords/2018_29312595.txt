 Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes conversion phosphoenolpyruvate ADP pyruvate ATP, rate-limiting reaction glycolysis. M2 isoform PK (PKM2) predominant form PK expressed tumors. addition well established cytosolic functions glycolytic enzyme, PKM2 displays nuclear localization important nonmetabolic functions tumorigenesis. Herein, report nuclear PKM2 interacts histone H2AX DNA damage conditions. Depletion PKM2 decreased level serine 139-phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) response DNA damage. vitro kinase assay reveals PKM2 directly phosphorylates H2AX serine 139, abolished deletion FBP-binding pocket PKM2 (PKM2-Del(515-520)). Replacement wild type PKM2 kinase dead mutant PKM2-Del(515-520) leads decreased cell proliferation chromosomal aberrations DNA damage conditions. Together, propose PKM2 promotes genomic instability tumor cells involves direct phosphorylation H2AX. findings reveal PKM2 novel modulator genomic instability tumor cells.
