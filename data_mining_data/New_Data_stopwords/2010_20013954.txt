 AIM: investigated molecular mechanisms hyperglycaemia-induced insulin resistance type 2 diabetes rats receiving continuous glucose infusion (GI). METHODS: Female Wistar rats infused either 2.8 mol/L glucose saline (2 mL/h) durations varying 0 15 days. Blood samples analysed daily determine glucose insulin dynamics. Subsets animals sacrificed soleus muscles extracted determination protein expression, subcellular location, activities insulin-signalling proteins. RESULTS: Rats accommodated systemic glucose oversupply developed insulin resistance day 5 (normoglycaemia/hyperinsulinaemia) type 2 diabetes day 15 (hyperglycaemia/normoinsulinaemia). effect GI protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta) activity independent changes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, occurred parallel increase PDK1 activity. Activated PKCzeta mainly located cytosol 5 days GI coincident translocation GLUT4 plasma membrane, normoglycaemia. 15 days GI, PKCzeta translocated cytosol plasma membrane concomitant decrease PDK1 activity. caused increase association PKCzeta PKB decrease PDK1-PKB reactions plasma membrane, leading reduced PKB activity. activity PKCzeta per se also compromised. PKCzeta PKB activity reduction blunted insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation eventually led hyperglycaemia diabetes. CONCLUSION: Translocation PKCzeta may play central role development type 2 diabetes.
