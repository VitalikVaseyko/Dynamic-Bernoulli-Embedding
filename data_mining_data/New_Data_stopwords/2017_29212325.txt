 investigated molecular mechanisms chronic heat stress impairs breast-meat quality broilers. Broilers assigned three groups: normal control (NC) group, heat-stress (HS) group, pair-fed (PF) group. 7 days heat exposure (32 degrees C), high temperature caused oxidative stress; elevated activity citrate synthase (CS), mRNA expression M-CPT1, phosphorylation level AMPKalpha; reduced mRNA expression avUCP. 14 days heat exposure, heat stress increased lightness drip loss decreased pH shear force breast meat. Additionally, heat exposure increased mRNA expressions FAS, ACC, PDK4; content lipids; activities lactic dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, decreased mRNA expression M-CPT1 activity CS. conclusion, chronic heat stress impairs meat quality causing mitochondria malfunction affecting energy-substance aerobic metabolism, resulting increased glycolysis intramuscular fat deposition.
