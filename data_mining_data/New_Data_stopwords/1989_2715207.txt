 effect cerebral ischemia activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme complex (PDHC) investigated homogenates frozen rat cerebral cortex following 15 min bilateral common carotid occlusion ischemia following 15 min, 60 min, 6 h recirculation 15 min ischemia. frozen cortical tissue animals, levels labile phosphate compounds, glucose, glycogen, lactate, pyruvate determined. cortex control animals, rate [1(-14)C]pyruvate decarboxylation 9.6 +/- 0.5 nmol CO2/(min-mg protein) 40% total PDHC activity. fraction increased 89% end 15 min ischemia. 15 min recirculation following 15 min ischemia, PDHC activity decreased 50% control levels depressed 6 h post ischemia. decrease activity due decrease total PDHC activity. Apart reduction ATP levels, acute changes levels energy metabolites essentially normalized 6 h recovery. Dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor PDH kinase, given rats 250 mg/kg i.p. four times 2 h, significantly decreased blood glucose levels 7.4 +/- 0.6 5.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/L fully activated PDHC. animals plasma glucose level maintained control levels 8.3 +/- 0.5 mumol/g intravenous infusion glucose, active portion PDHC increased 95 +/- 4%. contrast, depressed PDHC activity 15 min following ischemia affected DCA treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
