 HIV-1 infection leads depletion CD4 T-cells associated persistent immune inflammation changes cellular metabolism. effort managing HIV infection combination antiretroviral therapies (ART) focused CD4 T-cell recovery, control persistent immune inflammation metabolism relatively underappreciated past. Recent discoveries interplay innate immunity, inflammation (especially inflammasome) metabolic changes context cancer autoimmunity provide emerging field chronic viral infections including HIV-1. previous review, described deregulated metabolism contributing immune dysfunctions alteration memory T-cell responses, mucosal protection, dendritic cell-related antigen presentation. Here, summarize latest knowledge detrimental influence long-lasting inflammation inflammasome activation induced HIV-1, gut dysbiosis, bacterial translocation, metabolism course viral infection. also report inability ART fully counteract inflammation, resulting partial metabolic improvement leading insufficient decrease risk non-AIDS events. advances understanding relationship inflammation, altered metabolism, long-term ART warranted. Additionally, critical need developing new strategies regulate pro-inflammatory signals enhance cellular metabolism immune functions order improve quality life individuals living HIV-1.
