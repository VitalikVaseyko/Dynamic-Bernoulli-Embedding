 previously described digitonin-perfusion technique [Quistorff, Grunnet & Cornell (1985) Biochem. J. 226, 289-297], intracellular material rat liver could liberated, refined, allowing release cytosol high purity periportal perivenous parts liver. cytosolic fractions obtained perfusing liver short intervals (10-20 s) digitonin (4-5 mg/ml), first normal perfusion direction then, interval 1-2 min, retrograde direction, eluate collected intervals. technique termed 'dual-digitonin-pulse perfusion'. eluate fractions showed peak specific activity cytosolic enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) pyruvate kinase (PK) 3-5-fold higher obtained biopsy liver. glutamine synthetase (GS) 10-fold higher specific activity obtained. Zonation, defined ratio specific activities periportal perivenous eluates, ALAT, LDH PK 10, 1.7 0.70 respectively. Zonation GS less 0.01. factors may modified slight zonation cytosolic protein 1.2-1.3. Peak concentrations eluate ATP, ADP, Pi, NAD+ glycerol 3-phosphate 32.5 +/- 11.4, 19.9 +/- 4.3, 71.9 +/- 25.4, 2.41 +/- 0.83 6.84 +/- 2.74 nmol/mg protein periportal eluates. difference periportal perivenous eluates except glycerol 3-phosphate, significantly higher perivenous eluates, 12.8 +/- 4.5 nmol/mg protein.
