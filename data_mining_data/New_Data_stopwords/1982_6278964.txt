 oxygen affinity canine blood changes markedly following birth. changes correlated alterations intracellular concentration 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). examined control erythrocyte glycolysis measurements intracellular enzymes intermediates, identified component responsible regulation 2,3-DPG concentration hence blood oxygen affinity canine postnatal development. concentration 2,3-DPG could regulated entirely enzymes Rapoport-Luebering shunt. detected alterations levels intracellular activity 2,3-DPG mutase 2,3-DPG phosphatase development; therefore postnatal changes 2,3-DPG must result changes intracellular concentrations 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-DPG) controlled reactions glycolytic pathway. Neither low intracellular concentrations glucose, glycolytic substrate, inherently low glycolytic rate account low 2,3-DPG levels birth. 1,3-DPG concentrations hence 2,3-DPG concentrations controlled activity pyruvate kinase, acts glycolytic sink reaction. intracellular activity pyruvate kinase decreases first 50-60 days age causes accumulation 2,3-DPG. subsequent change vivo kinetic properties enzyme, giving increased intracellular activity resulting slow decline 2,3-DPG concentrations toward normal adult values.
