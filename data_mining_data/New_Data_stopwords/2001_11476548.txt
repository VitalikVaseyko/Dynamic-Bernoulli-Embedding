 simple method determine vitro catalytic turnover constant several substrates herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase presented study. method based continuous spectroscopic enzyme-coupled assay allows one monitor herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase activity presence unlabeled substrates. clear correlation catalytic turnover constant rate decrease absorbance time assay demonstrated. Exploiting correlation, method used determine rapidly precisely catalytic turnover constant antiviral lead compounds readily available radioactive labeled form.
