 study designed evaluate effects dietary vitamin E synthetic antioxidants prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis isolated aorta segments perfused hearts well thromboxane (TxA2) synthesis thrombin-stimulated washed platelets. Weanling male New Zealand rabbits fed vitamin E-deficient basal diet basal diet supplemented either all-rac-alpha-tocopherol acetate propyl gallate DPPD (N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine). 30 days diet, plasma tocopherol level, pyruvate kinase liver microsomal NADPH oxidase determined. DPPD propyl gallate prevented development myopathy. None synthetic antioxidants could substitute vitamin E decreasing enzymatic lipid peroxidation. PGI2 release aorta lowered vitamin E deficiency highest DPPD supplementation. Langendorff perfused heart, however, PGI2 release highest vitamin E-deficient group, possibly due cardiomyopathy. TxA2 synthesis washed platelets challenged thrombin independent antioxidant status animal. data showed dietary antioxidants selectively affect eicosanoid synthesis different tissues.
