 BACKGROUND: function survival pancreatic beta-cells strongly depend glucose concentration autocrine secretion peptide growth factors. NGF specific receptors TrkA p75NTR play pivotal role islet survival glucose-dependent insulin secretion. therefore investigated whether glucose concentration influences expression TrkA p75NTR rat islets INS-1E beta-cells mRNA protein level (INS-1E). METHODS: Gene expression NGF receptors TrkA p75NTR also metabolic gene liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) neurotrophin receptors TrkB TrkC studied semi-quantitative PCR real-time PCR islets INS-1E beta-cells. RESULTS: rat islets, high glucose exposure (25 mmol/l) increased gene expression TrkA, p75NTR L-PK. Expression TrkA, p75NTR L-PK reflected insulin secretion respective glucose concentration. rat INS-1E insulinoma cells, expression L-PK p75NTR suppressed low glucose islets, expression TrkA strongly increased low glucose levels thus regulated differently islets. Expression TrkB TrkC regulated glucose concentration all. TrkA protein regulated fashion mRNA expression, p75NTR protein significantly regulated within 24 h. CONCLUSION: Glucose interacts gene expression TrkA p75NTR strongly involved beta-cell growth glucose-dependent insulin secretion. fact TrkA expression regulated opposite way islets INS-1E beta-cells might reflect specific grade differentiation tendency proliferate.
