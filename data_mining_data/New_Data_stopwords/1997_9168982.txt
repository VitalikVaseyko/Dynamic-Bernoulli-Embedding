 steady-state dynamic behavior partial glycolytic reaction sequence investigated cell-free extracts yeast. Pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase glucose 6-phosphate isomerase cooperate multienzyme system centered around 6-phosphofructokinase (6-PFK) fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) cycle. reaction system operates thermodynamically open conditions maintained continuous supply substrates, i.e., glucose 6-phosphate (Glc6P), ATP phosphoenolpyruvate (PPrv) flow-through reaction chamber. Appropriate conditions lead occurrence (two) coexisting markedly different time-independent states metabolite concentrations fluxes. particular experimental conditions, changes influx adenylic energy charge, [AEC]IN, may cause transitions alternative steady states either reversible occurs classical hysteresis phenomena, or, importantly, irreversible (irreversible transitions, IT) system able switch back previous state even perturbation reverted. emergence irreversible transitions result artificial non-realistic experimental constraints, potential intrinsic property non-linear dynamic system exhibiting bi- multistability. one-way transitions may well important biological implications respect switching, adaptation memory phenomena.
