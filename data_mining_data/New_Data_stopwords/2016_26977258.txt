 identification biomarkers early detection acute kidney injury (AKI) clinically important. Acute kidney injury (AKI) critically ill patients closely associated increased morbidity mortality. Conventional biomarkers, serum creatinine (SCr) blood urea nitrogen (BUN), frequently used diagnose AKI. However, biomarkers increase significant structural damage occurred. Recent efforts focused identification validation new noninvasive biomarkers early detection AKI, prior extensive structural damage. Furthermore, AKI biomarkers provide valuable insight molecular mechanisms complex heterogeneous disease. previous study suggested pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), excreted urine, sensitive biomarker nephrotoxicity. appropriately optimally utilize PKM2 biomarker AKI requires complete characterization. review highlights major studies addressed diagnostic prognostic predictive power biomarkers AKI assesses potential usage PKM2 early biomarker AKI. summarize current state knowledge regarding role biomarkers molecular cellular mechanisms AKI. review elucidate biological basis specific biomarkers contribute improving early detection diagnosis AKI.
