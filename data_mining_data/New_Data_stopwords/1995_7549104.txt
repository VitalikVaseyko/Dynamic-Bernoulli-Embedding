 genes pyruvate kinases psychrophile, Bacillus psychrophilus, mesophile, Bacillus licheniformis, cloned Escherichia coli, nucleotides sequenced. two bacterial enzymes extra C-terminal sequence consisting 110 amino acid residues, found B. stearothermophilus enzyme. enzymes overexpressed E. coli properties purified enzymes compared B. stearothermophilus enzyme. enzymes less stable B. stearothermophilus one. B. psychrophilus enzyme stable B. licheniformis one. Similarly B. licheniformis B. stearothermophilus pyruvate kinases, B. psychrophilus enzyme activated AMP ribose 5-phosphate, inhibited ATP fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Thus, enzymes similar sigmoidal saturation curve phosphoenolpyruvate allosteric effectors, optimum temperatures thermostabilities different.
