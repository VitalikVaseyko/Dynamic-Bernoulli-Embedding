 recent studies microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures indicated miR-143/145 cluster significantly downregulated several types cancer represents putative tumor-suppressive miRNA human cancers. aim study investigate functional significance miR-143/145 cluster cancer cells identify novel molecular targets miR-143/145 cluster renal cell carcinoma (RCC). expression levels miR-143 miR-145 significantly downregulated RCC tissues compared adjacent non-cancerous tissues. significant positive correlation recognized miR-143 miR-145 expression. Restoration mature miR-143 miR-145 786-O A498 RCC cells revealed mature miRNAs significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation invasion, suggesting miR-143/145 cluster functioned tumor suppressor RCC. Gene expression data silico database analysis showed hexokinase-2 (HK2) gene, encodes glycolytic enzyme crucial Warburg effect cancer cells, candidate target miR-143/145 cluster. Luciferase reporter assays showed miR-143 miR-145 directly regulated HK2. RCC clinical specimens, expression HK2 significantly higher cancer tissues non-cancerous tissues. Silencing HK2 suppressed RCC cell proliferation invasion, suggesting HK2 oncogenic functions RCC. Thus, data showed loss tumor-suppressive miR-143/145 cluster enhanced RCC cell proliferation invasion targeting HK2.
