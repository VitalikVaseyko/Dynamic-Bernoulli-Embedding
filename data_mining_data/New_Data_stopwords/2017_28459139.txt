 outcome structure-guided mutational analyses often used support postulated mechanisms protein allostery. However, limits informative mutations understanding allosteric mechanisms completely clear. Here, report exercise evaluate whether mutational data support simplistic mechanistic model, developed minimal data inputs. Due lack mechanism explain alanine allosterically modifies affinity human liver pyruvate kinase (approved symbol PKLR) substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, proposed speculative allosteric mechanism system. Within allosteric amino-acid-binding site (something effector site must, necessity, contribute allosteric mechanism), implemented multiple mutational strategies: (1) site-directed random mutagenesis positions contact bound alanine (2) mutations probe specific questions. Despite acknowledged inadequacies used formulate speculative mechanism, many mutations modified allosteric coupling constant (Qax ) consistent mechanism. observed support speculative mechanism leaves us ponder best use mutational data structure-function studies allosteric mechanisms. mutational databank derived exercise independent value training testing algorithms specific allostery.
