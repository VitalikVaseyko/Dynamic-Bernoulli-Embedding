 majority research suggested alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) potential therapeutic agent chronic diseases associated oxidative stress, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, neurodegeneration. Therefore, nutritional supplementation ALA recommended although effects short- long-term intake ALA central organs healthy individuals studied detail yet. Therefore, liver tissue 4 74 weeks ALA-treated healthy C57BL6/J mice respect lipid metabolism analyzed. so, shown short-term long-term ALA treatment caused marked increase beta-oxidation, indicated significant rise mRNA expression fgf21, pparalpha, target genes, example, acox1, cpt1alpha, cpt2, well Fgf21 plasma concentration. Glycolytic activity, assessed pklr1 mRNA expression pyruvate kinase activity, also found increased. addition, shown short- long-term ALA treatment increased cholesterol content, induced systemic triglyceridemia, enhanced rxralpha lxralpha mRNA expression. Despite fact short-term ALA intake reduced lipogenesis, given significant declines fas srebp1c mRNA expression, long-term ALA intake induced significant rise lipogenic genes, treatment regimen caused fat accumulation. This, however, pronounced upon long-term ALA intake, leading hepatic steatosis liver injury, indicated increased inflammation disruption general hepatic architecture. summary, prophylactic abundant use ALA healthy conditions considered caution.
