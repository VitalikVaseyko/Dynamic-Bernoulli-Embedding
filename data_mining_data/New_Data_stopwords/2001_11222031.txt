 Aspects carbohydrate metabolism Daphnia magna exposed 48 96 h sublethal concentrations mercury lindane investigated. General well toxicant-specific perturbations intermediary metabolism observed. model toxicants caused increase glycolytic hexose-monophosphate shunt activity. Mercury exposure increased lactate dehydrogenase isocitrate activity (only 96 h), lindane exposure, contrary, inhibited cellular lactate formation increased Krebs' cycle activity (only 48 h). Daphnids exposed sublethal mercury concentrations clearly exhibited increased glycogenolytic activity, lindane-exposed organisms mainly glycogen phosphorylase inhibition detected. short-term enzyme-based effect levels (48--96 h LOEC EC(10) values) compared effects population dynamics. evaluation model toxicants suggests threshold levels (LOEC EC(10) values) based pyruvate kinase activity 48 96 h exposure could potential early warning signals long-term effects. set enzymatic endpoints, based intermediary metabolism, suggested characterize metabolic state daphnids.
