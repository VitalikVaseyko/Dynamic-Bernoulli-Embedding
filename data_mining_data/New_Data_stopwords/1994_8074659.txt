 co-expression plasmid containing coding sequence human liver pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1 alpha E1 beta subunits constructed. Functionally active PDH E1 protein produced co-expression plasmid introduced host Escherichia coli cell, BL21 (DE3)/plysS. contrast, production E1 alpha alone resulted catalytically inactive protein, suggesting important role E1 beta subunit constituting enzyme activity. PDH E1 protein produced E. coli capable phosphorylated PDH-specific kinase. co-expression system provide useful tool studying biochemical properties human PDH E1.
