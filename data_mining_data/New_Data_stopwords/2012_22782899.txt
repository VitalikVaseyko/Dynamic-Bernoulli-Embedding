 Cancer stem cells (CSCs) thought partially responsible cancer resistance current therapies tumor recurrence. Dichloroacetate (DCA), compound capable shifting metabolism glycolysis glucose oxidation, via inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase used. show DCA able shift pyruvate metabolism rat glioma CSCs effect rat neural stem cells. DCA forces CSCs oxidative phosphorylation trigger production reactive oxygen species consecutive anti-cancer apoptosis. However, DCA, associated etoposide irradiation, induced Bax-dependent apoptosis CSCs vitro decreased proliferation vivo. former phenomenon related DCA-induced Foxo3 p53 expression, resulting overexpression BH3-only proteins (Bad, Noxa, Puma), turn facilitates Bax-dependent apoptosis. results demonstrate small drug available clinical studies potentiates induction apoptosis glioma CSCs.
