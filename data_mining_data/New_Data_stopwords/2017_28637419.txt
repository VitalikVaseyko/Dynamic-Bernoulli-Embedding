 BACKGROUND: Alteration cellular metabolism hallmark cancer, underlies exciting opportunities develop effective, anti-cancer therapeutics inhibition cancer metabolism. Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+), essential coenzyme energy metabolism signaling molecule linking cellular energy status spectrum molecular regulation, shown high demand variety cancer cells. Depletion NAD+ inhibition key biosynthetic enzymes become attractive strategy target cancer. OBJECTIVE METHOD: main objective article review recent patents develop implicate chemical inhibitors key NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes cancer treatment. first discuss biological principles NAD+ metabolism normal malignant cells, focus feasibility selectively targeting cancer cells pharmacological inhibition nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) indoleamine/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO/TDO), rate-limiting salvage de novo NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes, respectively. analyze series recent patents development optimization chemical scaffolds inhibiting NAMPT IDO/TDO enzymes potential anticancer drugs. Conclusion Results: reviewed 16 relevant patents published since 2015, summarized chemical properties, mechanisms action proposed applications patented compounds. Without better understanding properties compounds, utility optimization clinical use unknown. compounds tested using cell mouse models cancer, results look promising clinical trials currently ongoing see results translate improved cancer treatments.
