 Lung cancer, leading cause cancer deaths, consists two major groups: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) NSCLC accounting approximately 75% cases lung cancers. suggested molecular changes including overexpression oncogenes decreased expression tumor suppressor genes responsible lung carcinogenesis. study, analyzed protein profiles four different human NSCLC cell lines compared normal human bronchial epithelial cells using two-dimensional PAGE MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. identified 12 protein spots different expressions normal cancer cells. proteins, vimentin, cytokeratin 8, YB-1, PCNA, Nm23, hnRNP A2/B1, HSP90beta known up-regulated lung cancers, consistent current study. also found expression M-type pyruvate kinase altered NSCLC likely due changes translational control and/or differential phosphorylation protein. Interestingly, expression tumor suppressor gene 14-3-3sigma down-regulated proto-oncogene TEF1delta up-regulated NSCLC cells. basis observations previous studies, propose altered expression 14-3-3sigma TEF1delta may involved lung carcinogenesis.
