 Many human cancers share similar metabolic alterations, including Warburg effect. However, remains unclear whether oncogene-specific metabolic alterations required tumor development. demonstrate "synthetic lethal" interaction oncogenic BRAF V600E ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL). HMGCL expression upregulated BRAF V600E-expressing human primary melanoma hairy cell leukemia cells. Suppression HMGCL specifically attenuates proliferation tumor growth potential human melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, active BRAF upregulates HMGCL octamer transcription factor Oct-1, leading increased intracellular levels HMGCL product, acetoacetate, selectively enhances binding BRAF V600E BRAF wild-type MEK1 V600E-positive cancer cells promote activation MEK-ERK signaling. findings reveal mutation-specific mechanism oncogenic BRAF V600E "rewires" metabolic cell signaling networks signals Oct-1-HMGCL-acetoacetate axis selectively promote BRAF V600E-dependent tumor development.
