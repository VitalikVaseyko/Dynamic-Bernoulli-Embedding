 contribution muscle tissue increased metabolic efficiency obese (fa/fa) Zucker rat 6 wk age examined. vitro O2 consumption similar obese nonobese soleus extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles, whether animals fed ad libitum, fasted, treated triiodothyronine. phenotypic difference vitro O2 consumption seen muscles preincubated without exogenous insulin. Pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase activities similar soleus EDL muscles phenotypes. Phosphofructokinase lactate dehydrogenase activities higher soleus muscles obese rats, whereas hexokinase activities higher EDL muscles nonobese rats. Mitochondrial whole muscle homogenate respiration rates similar phenotypes. soleus EDL muscles obese animals weighed less nonobese, empty carcass weights similar. Taken together data suggest muscle mass, muscle O2 consumption, muscle oxidative capacity similar 6-wk-old obese nonobese rats. Therefore tissues probably responsible increased metabolic efficiency young obese rat.
