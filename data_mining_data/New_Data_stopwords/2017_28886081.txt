 Orexins hypothalamic neuropeptides regulate feeding, reward, wakefulness energy homeostasis. present study sought characterize involvement orexin glucose metabolism HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, investigated role hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) response. HepG2 cells exposed different concentrations orexin (10-9 10-7 M) vitro, without orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) inhibitor (SB334867), HIF-1alpha inhibitor (YC-1) combination inhibitors. Subsequently, OX1R, HIF-1alpha expression localization, glucose uptake, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression ATP content measured. investigated intracellular fate glucose measuring gene expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) pyruvate dehydrogenase B (PDHB), well metabolite levels including lactate generation mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. activity phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) pathway also assessed. results showed expression OX1R predominantly located nucleus HepG2 cells. Orexin oxygen-independently promoted mRNA protein expression HIF-1alpha well nuclear accumulation HepG2 cells elevated HIF-1alpha protein associated, least partly, activation PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Orexin stimulated GLUT1 expression, glucose uptake well ATP generation HepG2 cells via OX1R acting HIF-1alpha pathway. Moreover, orexin inhibited LDHA, PDK1 expression lactate production, stimulated PDHB expression PDH enzyme activity independent HIF-1alpha. results indicated orexin signaling facilitated glucose flux mitochondrial oxidative metabolism rather glycolysis HepG2 cells. findings provide new insight regulation glucose metabolism orexin hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
