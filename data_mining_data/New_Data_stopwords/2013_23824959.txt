 Resveratrol (RSV) polyphenolic compound suggested anti-diabetic properties. Surprisingly, little known regarding effects RSV supplementation adipose tissue (AT) metabolism vivo. purpose study assess effects RSV mitochondrial content respiration, glyceroneogenesis (GNG), adiponectin secretion adipose tissue Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Five-week-old ZDF rats fed chow diet (ZDF RSV) without (ZDF chow) RSV (200 mg/kg body wt) 6 wk. Changes adipose tissue metabolism assessed subcutaneous (scAT) intra-abdominal [retroperitoneal (rpWAT), epididymal (eWAT)] adipose tissue depots. ZDF RSV rats showed lower fasting glucose higher circulating adiponectin, well lower glucose area curve intraperitoneal glucose insulin tolerance tests ZDF chow. [(1)(4)C]pyruvate incorporation triglycerides adiponectin secretion higher scAT ZDF RSV rats, concurrent increases adipose tissue triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase-E1alpha (PDH) (Ser293) protein content depot. Moreover, uncoupled mitochondrial respiration complex II-supported respiration increased scAT rpWAT, correlated increases cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX4) protein content. vitro treatment scAT RSV (50 mumol/l; 24 h) induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA expression. Collectively, data demonstrate RSV induce adipose tissue mitochondrial biogenesis parallel increases GNG adiponectin secretion.
