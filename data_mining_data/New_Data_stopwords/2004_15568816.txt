 active site T298 residue yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK), located position serve potentially proton donor, mutated cysteine. T298C YPK isolated purified, enzymatic properties characterized. Fluorescence CD spectra indicate minor structural perturbations. kinetic analysis Mg(2+)-activated enzyme demonstrates catalytic activity absence heterotropic activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). presence Mg(2+) FBP, T298C approximately 20% activity wild-type (wt) YPK. activator constant FBP increases 1 order magnitude compared constant wt enzyme. T298C shows positive cooperativity FBP Hill coefficient 2.6 (wt, n(H,FBP) = 1). Mn(2+)-activated T298C behaves like Mn(2+)-activated wt YPK V(max) 20% wt enzyme without FBP. pH-rate profile T298C relative wt YPK shows pK(a,2) shifted 6.4 wt 5.5, indicating thiol group elicits acidic pK shift. Inactivation wt T298C iodoacetate elicits pseudo-first-order loss activity T298C inactivated 8 100 times faster wt YPK. pH dependence inactivation rate constant T298C gives value 8.2, consistent pK thiol. Changes fluorescence indicate T298C-Mg(2+) complex binds PEP, ADP, ligands together. demonstrates lack activity due loss substrate binding lack ability induce proper conformational change. mutation also induces changes binding FBP relevant complexes. Binding metal binding PEP enzyme complexes also differentially altered. Solvent isotope effects observed wt T298C. Proton inventory studies indicate k(cat) affected proton water transition state effects metal ion-dependent. results consistent water active site proton donor. Active site residue T298 critical activity plays role activation water affects pK modulates catalytic activity.
