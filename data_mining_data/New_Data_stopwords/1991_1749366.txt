 vitro preparation chick retina used show occurrence transient changes intracellular pH energy metabolites occurs spreading depression (SD). initial increase intracellular pH associated elevated values ADP, P-Creatine, lactate pyruvate, intermediary acid shift increases ATP values decreases ADP, late alkaline rebound P-Creatine levels reduced content ADP lactate elevated. transient changes intracellular pH observed SD, correlated levels energy metabolites, supports hypothesis intracellular pH used tissue mechanism rapidly modify metabolic activities neurons glial cells. suggest first alkaline shift caused glial cells intermediary acid shift neurons. However, specific cell could pointed responsible late alkaline shift could explain refractoriness neurons phenomenon.
