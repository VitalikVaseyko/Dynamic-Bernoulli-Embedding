 Two key enzymes glycolysis, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, studied embryonal carcinoma cells (P19 EC cells) three differentiated derivatives relation growth rate differentiation state. growth rates P19 EC cells differentiated derivatives positively correlated specific activity phosphofructokinase expression L-subunit enzyme. specific activity pyruvate kinase isozyme composition correlated growth rate seems correlated differentiation state cells. decrease specific activity pyruvate kinase differentiation P19 EC cells induced retinoic acid dimethylsulfoxide preceded shift K- M-type pyruvate kinase. contrast aggregates treated dimethylsulfoxide, specific activity pyruvate kinase reduced aggregation presence retinoic acid. plating dimethylsulfoxide-treated aggregates presence dimethylsulfoxide, decrease specific activity obtained. retinoic acid dimethylsulfoxide able induce K- -M shift pyruvate kinase.
