 system extracellular proteolysing, consists plasminogen (PGn), active protease (plasmin), PGn activation PGn activators inhibitors, influences nervous tissue functions, growth, differentiation proliferation both, normal pathological conditions. purpose investigation study effects exogenous PGn, activator streptokinase (SK), PK equimolar complex morpho-functional state neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells. PGn, SK, PK complexes stimulated cells proliferation 1-3 days incubation, shown cell quantity increase. also observed DNA, RNA protein increase. low lactate dehydrogenase efflux evidence addition proteins investigation culture medium prevented development degenerative alterations connected serum deprivation. levels extracellular PGn-activator activity, measured biochemical fibrinolytic assay, increased SK. SK effect vanished 3rd day SK formed complexes PK. New original facts obtained testify probability initiation neoplastic transformation tumor growth potentiation.
