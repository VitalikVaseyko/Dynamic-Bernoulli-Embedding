 Fatty acids primary energy source heart. heart acquires fatty acids associated albumin derived lipoprotein lipase (LpL)-mediated hydrolysis lipoprotein triglyceride (TG). generated heart-specific LpL knock-out mice (hLpL0) determine whether cardiac LpL modulates actions peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors affects whole body lipid metabolism. Male hLpL0 mice significantly elevated plasma TG levels decreased clearance postprandial lipids despite normal postheparin plasma LpL activity. large density lipoprotein-TG uptake decreased 72% hLpL0 hearts. However, heart uptake albumin-bound free fatty acids altered. Northern blot analysis revealed decrease expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha-response genes involved fatty acid beta-oxidation. Surprisingly, expression glucose transporters 1 4 insulin receptor substrate 2 increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 insulin receptor substrate 1 reduced. Basal glucose uptake increased markedly hLpL0 hearts. Thus, loss LpL heart leads defective plasma metabolism TG. Moreover, fatty acids derived lipoprotein TG albumin-associated fatty acids important cardiac lipid metabolism gene regulation.
