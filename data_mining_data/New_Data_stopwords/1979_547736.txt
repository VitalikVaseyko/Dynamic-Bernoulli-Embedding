 Pyruvate kinase deficient red blood cells abnormal tendency lose ATP exposed low pO2 cyanide, whereas normal red cells not. energy depleted, red cells take calcium subsequently lose intracellular potassium water. shown previously quinine inhibit potassium water flux seen energy depleted normal cells. present study indicates quinine protects cyanide treated pyruvate kinase deficient erythrocytes water potassium loss. Quinine prevent ATP depletion calcium uptake. six hours, cyanide treated pyruvate kinase deficient cells lost average 486 gm water per kilogram cell solids 140 mmoles potassium per kilogram cell solids, cells treated quinine cyanide lost 106 gm water per kilogram cell solids 77 mmoles potassium per kilogram cell solids. data support concept membrane lesion pyruvate kinase deficiency secondary ATP depletion manifestation Gardos effect. Quinine may therapeutic potential treatment pyruvate kinase deficiency hemolytic anemia.
