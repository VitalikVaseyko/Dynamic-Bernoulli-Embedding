 retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 protein (RIG-I)-like receptors sense viral dsRNA cytosol, RIG-I melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) recruited mitochondria interact mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) initiate antiviral immune responses. study, demonstrate biotin-containing enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) plays essential role virus-triggered activation nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling mediated MAVS. PC contributes enhanced production type interferons (IFNs) pro-inflammatory cytokines, PC knockdown inhibits virus-triggered innate immune response. addition, PC shows extensive antiviral activity RNA viruses, including influenza virus (IAV), human enterovirus 71 (EV71), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Furthermore, PC mediates antiviral action targeting MAVS signalosome induces IFNs pro-inflammatory cytokines promoting phosphorylation NF-kappaB inhibitor-alpha (IkappaBalpha) IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, well NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, leads activation interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) myxovirus resistance protein 1 (Mx1). findings suggest PC important player host antiviral signaling.
