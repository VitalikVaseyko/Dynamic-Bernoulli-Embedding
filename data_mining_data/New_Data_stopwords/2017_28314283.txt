 BACKGROUND: US, African Americans high death rate triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized lack hormone receptors (ER, PR, HER2/ERRB2) otherwise valuable targets chemotherapy. need identify novel targets negatively impact TNBC tumorigenesis. TNBCs release abundance lactic acid, normoxic, hypoxic hyperoxic conditions; referred Warburg effect. Accumulated lactic acid sustains peri-cellular acidity propels metastatic invasion malignant aggressive transformation. source lactic acid believed via conversion pyruvate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) last step glycolysis, studies focusing LDHA isoform. MATERIALS METHODS: study, LDHA silenced using long-term MISSION(R) shRNA lentivirus human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Down-regulation LDHA transcription protein expression confirmed western blot, immunocytochemistry qPCR. number parameters measured fully viable vector controls versus knock-down (KD) clones, including levels lactic acid produced, glucose consumed, ATP basic metabolic rates. RESULTS: data show lentivirus V-165 generated knock-down clone effective reducing gene protein levels less 1% vector controls. Stable KD showed absolutely changes cell viability, lactic acid production, ATP, glucose consumption basic metabolic rate. Given complete absence impact observed parameter LDH-A KD somewhat contrary findings literature, analysis required determine why. Whole-transcriptome analytic profile MDA-MB-231 LDH subtypes using Agilent Human Genome 4x44k microarrays, data show following component breakdown. Transcripts: 30.47 % LDHA, 69.36% LDHB, 0.12% LDHC 0.05% LDHD. CONCLUSION: findings underscore importance alternative isoforms LDH cancer cells produce lactic acid, LDHA silenced inhibited. LDHA silencing alone effective hampering inducing changes survival, metabolism lactic acid produced cell line high concentrations LDHB. Future research required confirm effects dual LDHA/B knockdown confirm sole source lactic acid produced occurs LDH (all isoforms) breast cancer cells.
