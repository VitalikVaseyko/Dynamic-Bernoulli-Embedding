 risk developing hepatocellular carcinoma significantly increased patients genetic hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis C infection. precise mechanisms underlying development hepatocellular carcinoma conditions well understood. Stem cells within liver, termed oval cells, involved pathogenesis hepatocellular carcinoma animal models may important development hepatocellular carcinoma human chronic liver diseases. aims study determine whether oval cells could detected liver patients genetic hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis C, whether relationship severity liver disease number oval cells. Oval cells detected using histology immunohistochemistry liver biopsies patients genetic hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis C. Oval cells observed normal liver controls. Oval cell numbers increased significantly progression disease severity mild severe diseases studied. conclude oval cells frequently found subjects genetic hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis C. association severity liver disease increase number oval cells consistent hypothesis oval cell proliferation associated increased risk development hepatocellular carcinoma chronic liver disease.
