 BACKGROUND AIMS: Obesity associated diseases demand better therapeutic strategies. Regenerative medicine combined gene therapy emerged promising approach various clinical applications. Adiponectin (ApN) receptors demonstrated play beneficial roles modulating glucose lipid homeostasis. current study, tested approach transplanting mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) porcine ApN receptor (pAdipoR) 1-transgenic mice high-fat/sucrose diet (HFSD)-fed mice. METHODS: Twenty 6-week-old Friend virus B/NJNarl male mice randomly assigned four groups control fed chow diet (chow) others HFSD 10 months. HFSD groups intraperitoneally injected per week 8 weeks placebo (200 muL phosphate-buffered saline), wild-type MSC (WT-MSC, 2 x 10(6) cells/200 muL phosphate-buffered saline) pAdipoR1-transgenic MSC (pR1-tMSC, 2 x 10(6) cells/200 muL phosphate-buffered saline), respectively. Body weights, blood samples, tissue histology, gene expression protein levels metabolism-associated genes analyzed. RESULTS: WT-MSC pR1-tMSC transplantations restored messenger RNA expression AdipoR1, glucose transporter 4 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-1 protein levels pyruvate kinase induced pR1-tMSC muscles HFSD-fed mice. liver, WT-MSC pR1-tMSC ameliorated HFSD-induced hepatosteatosis, gene expression lipoprotein lipase hormone-sensitive lipase upregulated latter. Lastly, pR1-tMSC transplantation reduced fatty acid synthase mRNA levels adipose tissues HFSD-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: study demonstrates modulatory actions MSC pR1-tMSC genes associated glucose lipid metabolism provides insights therapeutic application obesity-associated metabolic complication.
