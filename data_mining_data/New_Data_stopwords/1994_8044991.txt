 evaluated effect hemolysis, icteric discoloration, lipemia, paraproteinemia, uremia enzymatic methods determining sodium, potassium, chloride, according National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards EP7-P proposals testing interference endogenous substances. sodium, potassium, chloride assays (reagent kits supplied Boehringer Mannheim) based electrolyte-dependent beta-galactosidase, pyruvate kinase, alpha-amylase, respectively. results compared obtained indirect ion-selective electrodes (ISE), turn validated flame photometry. analyzed samples Hitachi 717, 737, 911 chemistry analyzers IL943 flame photometer. enzymatic results good agreement ISE, interference-related differences generally without clinical significance; however, none enzymatic methods could analyze grossly lipemic samples.
