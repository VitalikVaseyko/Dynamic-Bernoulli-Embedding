 PURPOSE: present study analyzed expression phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK), Fyn kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1) impact survival patients resected gastric cancer received cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS METHODS: Korean patients stage II-IV (M0) gastric adenocarcinoma underwent gastrectomy D2 lymph node resection received combination regimen cisplatin S-1 enrolled. Immunohistochemistry carried determine expression pAMPK, Fyn kinase, PDK-1 operative specimens gastric cancer. expression divided two groups according intensity score (negative: 0 1+ positive: 2+ 3+). RESULTS: January 2006 July 2010, 73 tumor samples obtained 74 patients analyzed. Forty patients included pAMPK-positive group, 33 patients included pAMPK-negative group. Meanwhile, positive Fyn kinase expression observed 10 patients (13.7 %), weak PDK-1 staining. clinicopathologic characteristics similar two groups according expression pAMPK. median follow-up duration 26.5 months (2.6-73.2), estimated 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) overall survival rates 55.0 78.4 %, respectively. multivariate analysis adjusted age, sex, Lauren classification, stage, pAMPK-negative group significantly associated improved RFS (Hazard ratio = 0.459, 95 % CI 0.109-0.711, P = 0.043). CONCLUSION: low expression pAMPK found correlated better RFS patients resected gastric cancer treated adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
