 Acute inhibition NHE1 Na(+)/H(+) exchanger protects ischemia-reperfusion injury chronic inhibition attenuates development cardiac hypertrophy failure. determine cardiac effects chronic inhibition NHE1 non-pathological conditions used NHE1-null mice model long-term NHE1 inhibition. Cardiovascular performance relatively normal Nhe1(-/-) mice although cardiac contractility relaxation slightly improved mutant mice FVB/N background. GSH levels GSH:GSSG ratios elevated Nhe1(-/-) hearts indicating enhanced redox potential. Consistent reduced need antioxidant protection, expression heat shock proteins Hsp60 Hsp25 lower Nhe1(-/-) hearts. Similarly, expression mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 reduced, increase expression ROS scavenging enzymes. GLUT1 levels increased Nhe1(-/-) hearts, number lipid droplets myocytes reduced, PDK4 expression refractory high-fat diet-induced upregulation observed wild-type hearts. High-fat diet-induced stress attenuated Nhe1(-/-) hearts, indicated smaller increases phosphorylation Hsp25 alpha-B crystallin, better preservation insulin sensitivity, evidenced PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Plasma glucose insulin levels lower high-fat diet-induced hepatic lipid accumulation reduced Nhe1(-/-) mice, demonstrating extracardiac effects NHE1 ablation. data indicate long-term ablation NHE1 activity increases redox potential, mitigates high-fat diet-induced myocardial stress fatty liver disease, leads better preservation insulin sensitivity, may alter cardiac systemic metabolic substrate handling mice.
