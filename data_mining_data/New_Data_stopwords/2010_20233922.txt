 Soluble, divalent cation-dependent oxaloacetate decarboxylases (ODx) catalyze irreversible decarboxylation oxaloacetate pyruvate CO(2). Although enzymes characterized different microorganisms, genes encode identified, functions poorly analyzed far. study, purified soluble ODx wild-type C. glutamicum 65-fold used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis peptide mass fingerprinting identification corresponding odx gene. Inactivation overexpression odx led absence ODx activity 30-fold increase ODx specific activity, respectively; findings unequivocally confirmed gene encodes soluble ODx. Transcriptional analysis odx indicated leaderless transcript organized operon together putative S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase gene. Biochemical analysis ODx revealed molecular mass native enzyme 62 +/- 1 kDa enzyme composed two approximately 29-kDa homodimeric subunits K(m) oxaloacetate 1.4 mM V(max) 201 micromol oxaloacetate converted per min per mg protein, resulting k(cat) 104 s(-1). Introduction plasmid-borne odx pyruvate kinase-deficient C. glutamicum strain restored growth mutant acetate, indicating high level ODx activity redirects carbon flux oxaloacetate pyruvate vivo. Consistently, overexpression odx gene L-lysine-producing strain C. glutamicum led accumulation less L-lysine. However, inactivation odx gene improve L-lysine production conditions tested.
