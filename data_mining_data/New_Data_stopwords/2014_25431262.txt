 Unlike normal differentiated cells, cancer cells primarily rely glycolysis generate energy needed cellular processes even normoxia conditions. phenomenon called aerobic glycolysis "the Warburg effect." Aerobic glycolysis inefficient generate ATP, advantages confers cancer cells remain fully explained. Several oncogenic signaling pathways, interplaying enzymes kinases involved glucose metabolism, participate switch oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) aerobic glycolysis. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) family functional RNA molecules translated proteins, exert regulatatory roles gene transcription translation. ncRNAs, especially miRNAs long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), may also great effect glucose metabolism targeting glycolysis enzymes directly also oncogenic signaling pathways indirectly. better understanding Warburg effect regulatory role ncRNAs cancer glucose metabolism may contribute treatment cancers.
