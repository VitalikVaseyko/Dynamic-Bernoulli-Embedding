 1. Ethionine-treated mice showed marked depletion liver glycogen, decrease glycogen-synthetase activity, increase activity glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase solubilization phosphorylase. 2. administration cortisol glucose alleviate changes effect ethionine completely prevented animals given methionine well ethionine. 3. activities following enzymes unchanged: hexokinase, glucokinase, glucose 6-phosphatase, phosphoglucomutase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase.
