 anaerobic growth bacteria, organic intermediates metabolism, pyruvate derivatives, serve electron acceptors maintain overall redox balance. conditions, ATP needed cell growth derived substrate-level phosphorylation. Escherichia coli, conversion glucose pyruvate yields 2 net ATPs, metabolism pentose, xylose, pyruvate yields 0.67 net ATP per xylose due need one (each) ATP xylose transport xylulose phosphorylation. fermentative growth, E. coli produces equimolar amounts acetate ethanol two pyruvates, reactions generate one additional ATP two pyruvates (one hexose equivalent) still maintaining overall redox balance. Conversion xylose acetate ethanol increases net ATP yield 0.67 1.5 per xylose. E. coli pfl mutant lacking pyruvate formate lyase cannot convert pyruvate acetyl coenzyme A, required precursor acetate ethanol production, could produce additional ATP. E. coli pfl mutants failed grow anaerobic conditions xylose minimal medium without negative effect survival aerobic growth. ackA mutant, lacking ability generate ATP acetyl phosphate, also failed grow xylose minimal medium anaerobic conditions, confirming need ATP produced acetate kinase anaerobic growth xylose. Since arabinose transport AraE, low-affinity, high-capacity, arabinose/H+ symport, conserves ATP expended pentose transport ABC transporter, pfl ackA mutants grew anaerobically arabinose. AraE-based xylose transport, achieved constitutively expressing araE, also supported growth pfl mutant xylose minimal medium. results suggest net ATP yield 0.67 per pentose enough provide maintenance energy enough support growth E. coli minimal medium. Thus, pyruvate formate lyase acetate kinase essential anaerobic growth E. coli xylose due energetic constraints.
