 High concentrations acetate, main by-product Escherichia coli (E. coli) high cell density culture, inhibit bacterial growth L-threonine production. Since metabolic overflux causes acetate accumulation, attempted reduce acetate production redirecting glycolysis flux pentose phosphate pathway deleting genes encoding phosphofructokinase (pfk) and/or pyruvate kinase (pyk) L-threonine-producing strain E. coli, THRD. pykF, pykA, pfkA, pfkB deletion mutants produced less acetate (9.44 +/- 0.83, 3.86 +/- 0.88, 0.30 +/- 0.25, 6.99 +/- 0.85 g/l, respectively) wild-type THRD cultures (19.75 +/- 0.93 g/l). THRDDeltapykF THRDDeltapykA produced 11.05 5.35 % L-threonine, achieved 10.91 5.60 % higher yield glucose, respectively. THRDDeltapfkA grew slowly produced less L-threonine THRD, THRDDeltapfkB produced levels L-threonine (102.28 +/- 2.80 g/l) yield glucose (0.34 g/g) similar THRD. dual deletion mutant THRDDeltapfkBDeltapykF also achieved low acetate (7.42 +/- 0.81 g/l) high L-threonine yields (111.37 +/- 2.71 g/l). level NADPH THRDDeltapfkA cultures depressed, whereas mutants produced NADPH THRD did. results demonstrated modification glycolysis E. coli THRD reduced acetate production increased accumulation L-threonine.
