 Guinean woman, heterozygous haemoglobin (Hb) S, studied episodes marked anaemia, repeated typical metaphyseal painful crises haemosiderosis. sickling syndrome resulted association Hb trait severe pyruvate kinase deficiency leading 2,3-DPG concentration twice normal levels. Sequence PK-R gene revealed undescribed mutation homozygous hemizygous state within exon 5 (nucleotide 2670 C-->A), leading interchange Ser 130 Tyr (PK Conakry). addition, patient carried new haemoglobin variant, Hb Conakry [alpha80(F1) Leu-->Val], seemed mild effect. high intraerythrocytic 2,3-DPG concentration induced PK deficiency resulted decreased oxygen affinity favoured sickling level almost similar Hb S/C compound heterozygous patients. confirmed oxygen binding measurements Hb A/Hb erythrocytes 2,3-DPG content modified vitro. Hysteresis deoxy- reoxygenation curves, well increase n(max) value, demonstrated extent HbS polymerization propositus almost RBCs homozygous sickle cell patient A/S heterozygous patient artificial vitro increase 2,3-DPG concentration.
