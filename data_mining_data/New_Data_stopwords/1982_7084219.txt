 incorporation [32P]phosphate L-type pyruvate kinase response glucagon studied hepatocytes isolated control adrenalectomized rats. control cells, pyruvate kinase phosphorylation maximally stimulated 210% glucagon. Adrenalectomy reduced basal extent phosphorylation response glucagon 25% measured control hepatocytes. impaired pyruvate kinase phosphorylation associated altered kinetic properties L-type pyruvate kinase. Glucagon injected vivo (1 mg/kg) adrenalectomized rats increase substrate-co-operativity L-type pyruvate kinase. results suggest molecular basis well-recognised glucocorticoid hormone-dependence stimulation glucagon hepatic gluconeogenesis. effects defective enzyme regulation hepatic metabolism suggested observation adrenalectomy abolished ability glucagon inhibit hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis vivo isolated hepatocytes.
