 OBJECTIVE: Even though cerebral vasospasm subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) causes cerebral ischemia infarction, metabolic alterations cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) SAH studied. study undertaken measure levels glucose, lactate, pyruvate glutamate CSF double hemorrhage dog models. METHOD: Thirty-two mongrel dogs either sex, weighing 15-30 kg, underwent double hemorrhage percutaneous needle puncture cisterna magna injection autologous blood day 0 day 2. dogs sacrificed day 3, 5 7, collecting CSF. another study, dogs treated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors PD98059 U0126, caspase-2 caspase-3 inhibitors day 3 day 6 initial blood injection. CSF collected day 7 dogs sacrificed. concentration glucose, lactate, pyruvate glutamate CSF measured photometrical method. RESULTS: Compared CSF collected day 0, glucose decreased days 5-7, lactate increased days 2-7, pyruvate increased days 2-7, glutamate increased days 3-7 (P < 0.05). groups treated MAPK caspase inhibitors, metabolic alterations remained unchanged compared CSF untreated dogs. Clinically, caspase inhibitors-2 -3, MAPK inhibitor U0126 failed prevent vasospasm. MAPK inhibitor PD98059 partially prevented vasospasm. CONCLUSION: data demonstrated metabolic alteration glucose, glutamate, lactate pyruvate CSF cerebral vasospasm. metabolic change consistent time course cerebral vasospasm. study suggests brain energy metabolites excitative amino acids altered cerebral vasospasm.
