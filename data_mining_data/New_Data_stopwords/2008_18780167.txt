 recent years renewed interest focus mitochondria animal human tissues. interest commenced latter part past century gained momentum first eight years new millennium. well accepted reason mitochondria recognized represent "power houses", i.e., ATP production factories tissues essential cell life, response variety different "cues" may participate significantly also cell death, associated normal turnover associated disease. Conversely, cancers (particularly advanced) mitochondria interact hexokinase 2 (HK-2) resulting suppression cell death supporting cell growth via enhanced glycolysis, even presence oxygen (Warburg effect). identification/elucidation proteins mechanisms involved deciding and/or participating cell fate (i.e., life, death, cancer) focused large extent mitochondrial outer compartment, taken collectively include outer membrane, space inner outer membranes, contact regions two membranes. Among established proteins believed involved events related cell fate "VDACs" form basis mini-review series. brief introductory review focuses mainly past discovery author colleagues VDAC located within outer mitochondrial compartment binding partner HK-2 pivotal players "Warburg effect" cancer. one case point, glucose added liver cytosol (mitochondria-free) rate glycolysis low. However, upon addition tumor mitochondria containing VDAC bound HK-2, low glycolytic rate increased high rate near catalyzed tumor cytoplasm tumor mitochondria derived.
