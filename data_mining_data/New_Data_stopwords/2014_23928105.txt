 OBJECTIVE: study investigated effects dietary methionine restriction (MR) progression established hepatic steatosis leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse. MATERIAL/METHODS: Ten-week-old ob/ob mice fed diets containing 0.86% (control-fed; CF) 0.12% methionine (MR) 14 weeks. 14 weeks, liver fat excised blood collected analysis. another study, blood collected determine vivo triglyceride (TG) very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion rates. Liver histology conducted determine severity steatosis. Hepatic TG, free fatty acid levels, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) also measured. Gene expression analyzed quantitative PCR. RESULTS: MR reversed severity steatosis ob/ob mouse. accompanied reduced body weight despite similar weight-specific food intake. Compared CF group, hepatic TG levels significantly reduced response MR, adipose tissue weight decreased. MR reduced insulin HOMA ratios increased total high-molecular-weight adiponectin levels. Scd1 gene expression significantly downregulated, Acadvl, Hadha, Hadhb upregulated MR, corresponding increased beta-hydroxybutyrate levels trend toward increased FAO. VLDL secretion rate also significantly increased MR mice, mRNA levels ApoB Mttp. expression inflammatory markers, Tnf-alpha Ccr2, also downregulated MR. CONCLUSIONS: data indicate MR reverses steatosis ob/ob mouse liver promoting FAO, increasing export lipids, reducing obesity-related inflammatory responses.
