 previous report, pepper receptor-like kinase 1 (CaRLK1) gene shown responsible negatively regulating plant cell death caused pathogens via accumulation superoxide anions. Here, examined whether gene also plays role regulating cell death abiotic stress. total concentrations free amino acids CaRLK1-overexpressed cells (RLKox) increased twofold compared wild-type Nicotiana tabacum BY-2 cells. Additionally, alanine pyruvate concentrations increased approximately threefold. accumulations associated expression levels isocitrate lyase (ICL) malate synthase genes specific activities, preferentially up-regulated RLKox cells. expression levels ethylene biosynthetic genes (ACC synthase ACC oxidase) suppressed, metallothionein lesion simulating disease 1 genes increased RLKox cells submergence-induced hypoxia. specific activity catalase, involved protecting ICL reactive oxygen species, also induced threefold RLKox cells. primary roots transgenic plants exposed hypoxic conditions grew similar rates normal conditions. propose CaRLK1 maintains persistent hypoxia-resistant phenotype.
