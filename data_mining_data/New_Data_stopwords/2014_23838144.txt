 investigate effect prolonged exercise training swimming performance underlying biochemical mechanisms juvenile common carp (Cyprinus carpio), measured critical swimming speed (Ucrit), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), activity red white muscle enzymes [pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) citrate synthase (CS)], tissue substrates (glycogen glucose content muscle liver) metabolite (the lactate content plasma muscle) content exercise-trained (60% Ucrit 4 weeks) non-trained fish. also measured biochemical indices trained non-trained fish immediately Ucrit, exhaustive exercise 1h exhaustive exercise. aerobic swimming performance, indicated Ucrit, increased significantly exercise training, likely higher tissue metabolic capacity, suggested higher CS activity red muscle tissue, higher energy store efficient substrate utilization, suggested higher liver muscle glycogen contents rest lower tissue glycogen contents Ucrit. lower lactate content Ucrit likely higher aerobic metabolic capacity, (or) clearance rate lactate trained fish may also contribute improved aerobic swimming performance. Compared Ucrit, exhaustive exercise elicited higher plasma muscle lactate contents. anaerobic metabolic performance affected exercise training, suggested EPOC. However, trained fish show higher lactate clearance rates, suggested lower muscle lactate content 1h recovery period following exhaustive exercise compared non-trained fish. Furthermore, trained fish decreased liver muscle glycogen contents profoundly exhaustive exercise, suggesting training improve substrate utilization anaerobic exercise.
