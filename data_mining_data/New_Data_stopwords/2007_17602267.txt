 BACKGROUND: Tumor pyruvate kinase M2 (tumor M2-PK) key enzyme altered metabolism tumor tissue. cancer, known present high concentrations malignant tissue, plasma body fluids. commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method exists detection tumor M2-PK. study undertakes systematic review current literature tumor M2-PK diagnostic tool provides overview current usage scope emerging biomarker. METHODS: MEDINE EMBASE databases searched English-language articles containing original data. MeSH headings used pyruvate kinase, tumor cancer. case reports review articles excluded final study population 30 manuscripts containing original data obtained. RESULTS: Eight articles evaluated plasma tumor M2-PK 511 esophago-gastric cancer, 226 pancreatobiliary cancer 470 colorectal cancer patients. Although inter-study variations cut-off points, consistent findings include elevated levels patients malignancy degree elevation corresponding extent disease. CONCLUSION: Tumor M2-PK elevated range gastrointestinal malignancy. pancreatobiliary malignancy, weight evidence suggests test used adjunctive diagnostic test conjunction CA 19-9 also may valuable biomarker adverse prognosis. Stool tumor M2-PK appears promising test colon cancer.
