 Red cell enzymes three children transient erythroblastopenia childhood measured compared age-matched normal children children hemolytic anemia. activity "age-dependent" enzyme hexokinase, aldolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, pyruvate kinase greatly increased red cells children hemolytic anemia, decreased red cells children erythroblastopenia childhood. activity pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase consistently low red cells children. findings inconsistent usual concept red cell enzyme activities decline throughout red cell life span. Rather, suggest may rapid loss activity red cell enzymes first days red cell life little decline enzyme activity.
