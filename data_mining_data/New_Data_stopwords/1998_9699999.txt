 Microcytic macrocytic red blood cells anaemic patients fractionated function cell surface properties countercurrent distribution technique using charge-sensitive dextran/poly(ethylene glycol) aqueous two-phase systems. deduced fractionation profiles, microcytic cells constitute heterogeneous cell population decreased surface charge properties while. macrocytic cells constitute homogeneous cell population behaviour similar control red blood cells. specific activity pyruvate kinase, age-dependent enzyme, change along microcytic red blood cells fractionation profiles, suggesting cells altered ageing properties. However, pyruvate kinase specific activity decreases left- right-hand side fractionation profile macrocytic red blood cells, indicating cells follow normal ageing process. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase specific activity change along fractionation profile cell population study, thus providing 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate life-span red blood cells anaemic patients.
