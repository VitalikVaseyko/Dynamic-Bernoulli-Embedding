 Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens His225Gln, Asp262Asn, Asp263Asn, Thr249Asn phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases analyzed oxaloacetate decarboxylase, pyruvate kinase-like activities. His225Gln Asp263Asn enzymes showed increased Km values Mn2+ PEP compared native enzyme, suggesting role His225 Asp263 Mn2+ PEP binding. mayor alterations Km values oxaloacetate detected varied enzymes. Alterations His225, Asp262, Asp263, Thr249, however, affect Vmax secondary activities much affected Vmax main reaction. results presented communication suggest different rate-limiting steps primary reaction secondary activities.
