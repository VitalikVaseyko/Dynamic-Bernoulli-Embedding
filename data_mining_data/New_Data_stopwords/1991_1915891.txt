 addition oligomycin presence Ca2+ increased ADP pool mitochondrial suspension. suggested oligomycin inhibition Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial respiratory activation function increased endogenous ADP pool. Low ADP concentrations (5-20 microM) produce inhibitory effect oligomycin. increase ADP levels presence glucose plus hexokinase resulted inhibition Ca(2+)-induced respiration, addition phosphoenol pyruvate plus pyruvate kinase followed reduction ADP levels, reversed oligomycin inhibitory effect. One essential stages ADP accumulation mitochondrial suspensions presence oligomycin Ca2+ proposed formation ADP AMP ATP, effected adenylate kinase.
