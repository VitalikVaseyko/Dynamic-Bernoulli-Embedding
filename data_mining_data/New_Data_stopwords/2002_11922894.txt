 OBJECTIVE: Coupling glucose oxidation glycolysis lower hypertrophied non-hypertrophied hearts, contributing compromised mechanical performance hypertrophied hearts. Here, describe studies test hypothesis low coupling glucose oxidation glycolysis hypertrophied hearts due reduced activity and/or expression pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). METHODS: examined effects dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor PDC kinase, alterations exogenous palmitate supply coupling glucose oxidation glycolysis isolated working hypertrophied control hearts aortic-constricted sham-operated male Sprague-Dawley rats. anticipated addition DCA absence palmitate would promote PDC activation consequently normalize coupling glycolysis glucose oxidation hypertrophied hearts hypothesis correct. RESULTS: Addition DCA removal palmitate improved coupling glucose oxidation glycolysis control hypertrophied hearts. However, coupling remained substantially lower hypertrophied hearts. PDC activity extracts hypertrophied hearts similar higher extracts control hearts perfusion conditions. differences observed hypertrophied control hearts respect expression PDC, PDC kinase, PDC phosphatase. CONCLUSIONS: Low coupling glucose oxidation glycolysis hypertrophied hearts due reduction PDC activity subunit expression indicating mechanism(s) responsible.
