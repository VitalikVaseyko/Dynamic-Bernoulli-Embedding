 Cancer cells preferentially catalyze glucose glycolytic pathway presence adequate oxygen. phenomenon known Warburg effect. case numerous cancer therapeutic agents, resistance remains significant problem using Taxol(R) treat malignancies. present study reported expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) induced Taxol treatment low toxic concentrations oral cancer cells. addition, Taxolresistant cells exhibited upregulated PDK1 protein mRNA expression. Elevated PDK1 levels contribute Taxol resistance hypoxic conditions. Inhibition PDK1 expression observed oral cancer cells treated PDK1 inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA). combination Taxol DCA showed synergistic inhibitory effects Taxolresistant cells hypoxic conditions; effects observed Taxolsensitive oral cancer cells normoxic conditions. present study provides novel mechanism overcoming Taxol resistance oral cancer cells, contribute towards development clinical therapeutics cancer patients.
