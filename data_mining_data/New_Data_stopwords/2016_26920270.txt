 Although exhaustive research established preslaughter stress major factor contributing pale, soft, exudative (PSE) meat, questions remain regarding biochemistry postmortem glycolysis. study, influence preslaughter stress protein acetylation relationship glycolysis studied. data show antemortem swimming significantly enhanced glycolysis total acetylated proteins postmortem longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle mice. Inhibition protein acetylation histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors eliminated stress induced increase glycolysis. Inversely, antemortem injection histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, trichostatin (TSA) nicotinamide (NAM), increased protein acetylation early postmortem glycolysis. data provide new insight biochemistry postmortem glycolysis showing protein acetylation regulates glycolysis, may participate regulation preslaughter stress glycolysis postmortem muscle.
