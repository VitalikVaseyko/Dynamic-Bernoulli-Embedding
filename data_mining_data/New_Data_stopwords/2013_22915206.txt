 Glycolytic ATP synthesis synaptic vesicles provides efficient mechanism fueling vesicular loading neurotransmitter glutamate. achieved part vesicle-bound pyruvate kinase. However, found vesicular glutamate uptake, presence pyruvate kinase substrates ADP phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), substantially exceeds caused exogenous ATP. propose much enhanced uptake part due extra ATP produced via mechanism involving novel enzyme, PEP-dependent ADP synthase. discuss implications enzyme energy homeostasis pathophysiology, well efficient synaptic glutamate transmission.
