 Heat induced complications cause increase large number proteins play role diverse pathways heat shock. detailed characterization proteins essential understanding molecular mechanisms involved heat stroke. report, proteins present rat liver compared 37 degrees C (control) core temperature (Tc) 42 degrees C (heat stress) 1D PAGE MALDI/MS/MS. Among proteins identified sample heat stress dimethyglycine dehydrogenase, transketolase, carboxylic ester hydrolase, pyruvate kinase, L-type pyruvate kinase, arginosuccinate synthetase; fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase peptidylpropyl isomerase A. findings show analysis large scale proteins MALDI/MS/MS provides better understanding molecular mechanisms associated heat shock. resolution proteins examined 1D-PAGE less obtained 2D-PAGE. specifically, 2D-PAGE allows better identification low molecular weight proteins resolved 1D-PAGE.
