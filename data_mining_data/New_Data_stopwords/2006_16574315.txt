 Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) enzyme regulates activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc). past, PDHc deficiency attributed mutations complex regulatory enzymes considered. recently reported first mutation PDP1, one two isoforms PDP, results severe exercise intolerance mild developmental delay patients. novel process aberrant pyruvate metabolism opens new avenue investigation PDHc deficiency, hitherto underappreciated.
