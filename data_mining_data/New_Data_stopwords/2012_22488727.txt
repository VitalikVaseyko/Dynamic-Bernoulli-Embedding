 genotoxic, extracellular accumulation amyloid beta (Abeta) protein subsequent neuronal cell death associated Alzheimer's disease (AD). APE1/Ref-1, predominant apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease essential eukaryotic cells, plays central role base excision repair (BER) pathway repairing oxidized alkylated bases single-strand breaks (SSBs) DNA. APE1/Ref-1 also involved redox activation several trans-acting factors (TFs) various cell types, little known role neuronal functions. emerging evidence APE1/Ref-1's role neuronal cells vulnerable AD neurodegenerative disorders, reflected nuclear accumulation AD brains. increase APE1/Ref-1 shown enhance neuronal survival oxidative stress. address whether APE1/Ref-1 level association proteins responsible protective effect, used 2-D proteomic analyses identified cytoskeleton elements (i.e., tropomodulin 3, tropomyosin alpha-3 chain), enzymes involved energy metabolism (i.e., pyruvate kinase M2, N-acetyl transferase, sulfotransferase 1c), proteins involved stress response (i.e., leucine-rich death domain, anti-NGF30), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotien-H (hnRNP-H) associated APE1/Ref-1 Abeta(25-35)-treated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines, two common neuronal precursor lines used Abeta neurotoxicity studies. levels proteins affected brains AD patients, study suggests neuroprotective role APE1/Ref-1 via association proteins modulating cellular functions Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity.
