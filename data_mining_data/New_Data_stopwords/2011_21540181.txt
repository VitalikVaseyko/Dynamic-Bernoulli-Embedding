 Cancer cells commonly exhibit increased nonoxidative D-glucose metabolism whereas induction mitochondrial metabolism may impair malignant growth. first used silico method called elementary mode analysis identify inhibition ALAT (L-alanine aminotransferase) putative target promote mitochondrial metabolism. experimentally show two competitive inhibitors ALAT, L-cycloserine beta-chloro-L-alanine, inhibit L-alanine production impair D-glucose uptake LLC1 Lewis lung carcinoma cells. latter inhibition linked initial energy deficit, quantified decreased ATP content, followed activation AMP-activated protein kinase subsequently increased respiration rates mitochondrial production reactive oxygen species, culminating ATP replenishment ALAT-inhibited LLC1 cells. Moreover, observe altered phosphorylation p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase 14), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), Rb1 (retinoblastoma 1) proteins, well decreased expression Cdc25a (cell decision cycle 25 homolog A) Cdk4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4). Importantly, sequelae ALAT inhibition culminate similarly reduced anchorage-dependent anchorage-independent growth rates LLC1 cells, together suggesting inhibition ALAT efficiently impairs cancer growth counteracting Warburg effect due compensatory activation mitochondrial metabolism.
