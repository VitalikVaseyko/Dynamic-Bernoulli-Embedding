 Dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) central component pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), converts pyruvate acetyl-CoA. Structural comparison cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) human full-length truncated E2 (tE2) cores revealed flexible linkers emanating edges trimers internal catalytic domains. Using secondary structure constraints revealed 8 cryo-EM reconstruction prokaryotic tE2 atomic structure template, derived pseudo atomic model human tE2. active sites conserved prokaryotic tE2 human tE2. However, marked structural differences apparent hairpin domain N-terminal helix connected flexible linker. permutations away catalytic center likely impart structures needed integrate second component inner core provide sturdy base linker holds pyruvate dehydrogenase access E2-bound regulatory kinase/phosphatase components humans.
