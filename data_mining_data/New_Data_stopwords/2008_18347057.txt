 PDK1 activates group kinases, including protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), serum glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK), mediate many effects insulin well agonists. PDK1 interacts phosphoinositides pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. study role interaction, generated knock-in mice expressing mutant PDK1 incapable binding phosphoinositides. knock-in mice significantly small, insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic. Activation PKB markedly reduced knock-in mice result lower phosphorylation PKB Thr308, residue phosphorylated PDK1. results inhibition downstream mTOR complex 1 S6K1 signaling pathways. contrast, activation SGK1 p90 ribosomal S6 kinase stimulation S6K1 induced feeding unaffected PDK1 PH domain mutation. observations establish importance PDK1-phosphoinositide interaction enabling PKB efficiently activated animal model. findings reveal reduced activation PKB isoforms impinges downstream signaling pathways, causing diminution size well insulin resistance.
