 effect type (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus key glycolytic enzymes red cells studied. activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase found significantly (p less 0.01) increased diabetic patients. Treatment insulin restored enzyme activities normal. increased activities key enzymes may help regulate red cell ATP level response elevated Na:K pump rate diabetes. increased activities enzymes may also due greater proportion young erythrocytes diabetic patients shortened red cell life span compared normal.
