 Photoreceptor death root cause vision loss many retinal disorders, unmet need neuroprotective modalities improve photoreceptor survival. biosynthetic requirement photoreceptors among highest body, meet demand, photoreceptors maintain ability perform aerobic glycolysis. highly regulated form glycolysis allows cells efficiently budget metabolic needs may critical link photoreceptor function survival. Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2) key regulator aerobic glycolysis. present study, characterized effect PKM2 deletion baseline functioning survival photoreceptors time utilizing photoreceptor-specific, PKM2 knockout mouse model. found upon PKM2 deletion, PKM1 upregulated outer retina increased expression genes involved glucose metabolism, led chronic degenerative changes outer retina mice. also discovered metabolic reprogramming provided survival advantage photoreceptors experimental model retinal detachment. study strongly supports hypothesis reprogramming metabolism may novel therapeutic strategy photoreceptor neuroprotection acute stress.
