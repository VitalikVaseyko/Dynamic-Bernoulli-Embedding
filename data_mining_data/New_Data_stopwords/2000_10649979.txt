 N'-methyl-N-(4-tert-butyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine)thiourea, SDZ048-619 (1), modest inhibitor (IC(50) = 180 microM) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK). optimization N-methylcarbothioamide moiety 1, discovered amides small acyl group, particular appropriately substituted amides (R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid, inhibitors PDHK. Utilizing acyl moiety, herein reported rationale leading optimization series acylated piperazine derivatives. Methyl substitution piperazine 2- 5-positions (with R absolute stereochemistry) markedly increased potency lead compound (>1,000-fold). Oral bioavailability compounds series good optimal (as measured AUC) 4-position piperazine substituted electron-poor benzoyl moiety. (+)-1-N-[2,5-(S, R)-Dimethyl-4-N-(4-cyanobenzoyl)piperazine]-(R)-3,3, 3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide (14e) inhibits PDHK primary enzymatic assay IC(50) 16 +/- 2 nM, enhances oxidation [(14)C]lactate (14)CO(2) human fibroblasts EC(50) 57 +/- 13 nM, diminishes lactate significantly 2.5 h post-oral-dose doses low 1 micromol/kg, increases ex vivo activity PDH muscle, liver, fat tissues normal Sprague-Dawley rats. PDHK inhibitors, however, lower glucose diabetic animal models.
