 BACKGROUND: Resistance 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) patients colorectal cancer prevents effective treatment leads unnecessary burdensome chemotherapy. Therefore, prediction 5-FU resistance imperative. METHODS: identify proteins linked 5-FU resistance, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics performed using human colon cancer cell line SNU-C4R induced 5-FU resistance. Proteins showing altered expression SNU-C4R identified matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight analysis, roles susceptibility 5-FU radiation evaluated various cell lines transfection specific siRNA creation overexpression constructs. Changes cellular signaling expression mitochondrial apoptotic factors investigated Western Blot analysis. mitochondrial membrane potential probe (JC-1 dye) flow cytometry system employed determine mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, protein levels determined Western Blot analysis tissues 122 patients rectal cancer clarify whether identified protein useful predictor chemoradiation response. RESULTS: identified mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (mPEPCK) candidate predictor 5-FU resistance. PEPCK downregulated SNU-C4R compared parent cell line SNU-C4. Overexpression mPEPCK significantly alter susceptibility either 5-FU radiation. Suppression mPEPCK led decrease cellular level phosphoenolpyruvate susceptibility 5-FU radiation. Furthermore, cellular levels phosphoenolpyruvate (an end product PEPCK substrate pyruvate kinase), phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated 4EBP1 decreased significantly secondary mPEPCK suppression SNU-C4. However, mPEPCK siRNA transfection induced changes neither mitochondrial membrane potential expression levels mitochondrial apoptotic factors Bax, Bcl-2, Bad. Downregulation total PEPCK observed tissues patients rectal cancer displayed poor responses preoperative 5-FU-based radiation therapy. CONCLUSION: overall results demonstrate mPEPCK useful predictor response chemoradiotherapy patients rectal cancer.
