 Liraglutide, long-lasting glucagonlike peptide1 analogue, used treatment patients type 2 diabetes mellitus since 2009. study, investigated anti-diabetic effects mechanisms action liraglutide spontaneous diabetic animal model, using KK/Upj-Ay/J (KKAy) mice. KKAy mice divided 2 groups, liraglutide group (mice treated 250 microg/kg/day liraglutide) model group (treated equivalent amount normal saline). C57BL/6J mice used controls (treated equivalent amount normal saline). treatment period lasted 6 weeks. treatment period, fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels body weight mice measured weekly basis. results revealed liraglutide significantly decreased FBG levels, area curve following oral glucose tolerance test insulin tolerance test, increased serum insulin levels, reduced homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance increased insulin sensitivity index. Furthermore, liraglutide ameliorated glycometabolism dysfunction increasing glycolysis via hexokinase glycogenesis via pyruvate kinase activation. ultrastructural examination pancreas revealed liraglutide improved damaged state islet beta cells increased number insulin secretory granules. real-time PCR results revealed gene expression glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) increased following treatment liraglutide. Liraglutide also upregulated protein expression GLUT4 liver tissue skeletal muscle. results suggest liraglutide ameliorates glycometabolism insulin resistance diabetic KKAy mice stimulating insulin secretion, increasing glycogenesis glycolysis upregulating expression GLUT4.
