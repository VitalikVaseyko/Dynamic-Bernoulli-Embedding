 p62 protein identified major component protein aggregations associated neurodegenerative disease. Oxidative insult also identified principal cause neurodegenerative disease. Thus, present study, investigated potential role p62 oxidative stress-induced cell death SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. results indicated H(2)O(2) treatment induced p62 expression SH-SY5Y cells. addition, p62 showed neuroprotective effects H(2)O(2)-induced cell death differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. p62 expression prolonged Akt phosphorylation later stages H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. Furthermore, coexpression p62 wild-type PDK1, upstream kinase Akt, increased Akt phosphorylation cell viability, whereas expression kinase-defective PDK1 reversed cytoprotective effects p62 oxidative stress. Overexpression p62 led dissociation PDK1 14-3-3theta protein, thought negative regulator PDK1 kinase activity. findings suggest mechanism involves p62-mediated modulation interaction signaling molecules results cell survival.
