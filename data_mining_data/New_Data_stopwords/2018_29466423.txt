 Differences regional protein expression within human retina may explain molecular predisposition specific regions ophthalmic diseases like age-related macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy. quantify protein levels human retina identify patterns differentially-expressed proteins, collected foveomacular, juxta-macular, peripheral retina punch biopsies healthy donor eyes analyzed protein content liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Protein expression analyzed 1-way ANOVA, gene ontology, pathway representation, network analysis. identified mean 1,974 proteins foveomacular retina, 1,999 juxta-macular retina, 1,779 peripheral retina. Six hundred ninety-seven differentially-expressed proteins included unique abundant anatomic region. Proteins higher expression region include: heat-shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90AA1), pyruvate kinase (PKM) foveomacular retina; vimentin (VIM) fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C (ALDOC); guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-1 (GNB1) guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-1 (GNAT1) peripheral retina. Pathway analysis identified downstream mediators integrin signaling pathway highly represented foveomacular region (P = 6.48 e-06). Metabolic pathways differentially expressed among retinal regions. Gene ontology analysis showed proteins related antioxidant activity higher juxta-macular peripheral retina, present lower amounts foveomacular retina. proteomic analysis suggests certain retinal regions susceptible different forms metabolic oxidative stress. findings give mechanistic insight retina function, reveal important molecular processes, prioritize new pathways therapeutic targeting.
