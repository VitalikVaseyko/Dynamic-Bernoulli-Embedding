 Depletion mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) treatment mitochondrial poison CCCP initiates mitochondrial stress signaling, operates altered Ca2+ homeostasis. C2C12 rhabdomyoblasts A549 human lung carcinoma cells mitochondrial stress signaling activates calcineurin number Ca2+ responsive factors including ATF, NFAT, CEBP/delta CREB. Additionally, PKC MAP kinase also activated. number nuclear gene targets including involved Ca2+ storage/release (RyR1, calreticulin, calsequestrin), glucose metabolism (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, Glut4), oncogenesis (TGFbeta1, cathepsin L, IGFR1, melanoma antigen) apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bid, Bad, p53) upregulated. Mitochondrial stress C2C12 myoblasts A549 cells induced morphological changes invasive phenotypes. cells also showed markedly increased resistance etoposide-induced apoptosis hallmark highly invasive tumors. results describe new mechanism altered nuclear gene expression phenotypic changes triggered mitochondrial dysfunction mtDNA damage.
