 aid recently developed Sensor reactor system, series three subsequent (13)C labeling experiments performed mirroring l-phenylalanine (l-Phe) production phase recombinant E. coli strain cultivated industry-like conditions 300 L bioreactor. basis data NMR labeling analysis, three subsequent flux patterns successfully derived monitoring l-Phe formation observation window 14 23.3 h process time. Linear programming performed identify optimal flux patterns l-Phe formation. Additionally, flux sensitivity analysis used identify promising metabolic engineering target. result, high rates phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate (PYR) conversion identified important reason deterioration l-Phe/glucose yield 20 finally 11 mol %. Considering characteristics enzyme kinetics involved, working hypothesis formulated phosphoenolpyruvate synthase activity increasingly hampered rising oxaloacetate 2-oxoglutarate concentrations, time pyruvate kinase activity arose due activation fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Hence, pps overexpression performed optimize existing production strain.
