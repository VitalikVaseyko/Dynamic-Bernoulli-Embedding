 present study explores possible channelling pyruvate generated either pyruvate kinase NADP-malate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase cross-linked permeabilized erythrocytes. generation unlabelled 14C-labelled pyruvate lactate measured rat erythrocytes, prepared cross-linking dimethyl suberimidate permeabilization digitonin exposed unlabelled 14C-labelled malate and/or phospho-enol-pyruvate. Rat erythrocytes found display NADP-malate dehydrogenase activity. conditions generation rates pyruvate either phospho-enol-pyruvate (15 microM) malate (0.5 mM) vastly different one another, greater fraction 2-keto acid converted lactate produced phospho-enol-[1-14C]pyruvate rather [U-14C]malate. difference obvious availability exogenous NADH close somewhat theoretically required ensure full conversion endogenously formed pyruvate lactate. findings compatible view pyruvate generated pyruvate kinase level converted lactate efficiently pyruvate produced reaction catalysed NADP-malate dehydrogenase.
