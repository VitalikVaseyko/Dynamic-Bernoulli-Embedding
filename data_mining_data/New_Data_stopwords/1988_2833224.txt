 effects [leucine]enkephalin angiotensin hepatic carbohydrate cyclic nucleotide metabolism compared. peptides stimulated glycogenolysis result increase phosphorylase activity enhanced glucose synthesis [2-14C]pyruvate, although neither significant effect pyruvate kinase activity. Although magnitudes effects peptides glycogenolysis comparable unaffected presence insulin. [Leu]enkephalin proved efficacious enhancing gluconeogenesis, response comparable glucagon. effectors decreased intracellular concentration cyclic AMP hepatocytes incubated control conditions addition sub-optimal concentrations glucagon. correlated ability two peptides inhibit basal hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity purified liver plasma membranes.
