 Controlling cholesterol levels major challenge human health, since hypercholesterolemia lead serious cardiovascular disease. Drugs target carbohydrate metabolism also modify lipid metabolism hence cholesterol plasma levels. sense, dichloroacetate (DCA), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, augments usage glycolysis-produced pyruvate mitochondria increasing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). several animal models, DCA decreases plasma cholesterol triglycerides. Thus, DCA used 70 treat diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia hypercholesterolemia satisfactory results. However, mechanism action remained unknown describe here. DCA increases LDLR mRNA protein levels well LDL intake several cell lines, primary human hepatocytes two different mouse models. effect mediated transcriptional activation evidenced H3 acetylation lysine 27 LDLR promoter. DCA induces expression MAPK ERK5 turns transcription factor MEF2. Inhibition ERK5/MEF2 pathway genetic pharmacological means decreases LDLR expression LDL intake. summary, results indicate DCA, inducing OXPHOS, promotes ERK5/MEF2 activation leading LDLR expression. ERK5/MEF2 pathway offers interesting pharmacological target drug development.
