 Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) member peroxiredoxin family. Aberrant expression PRDX1 described various cancers. investigated significance up-regulation non-challenged hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) cells establishing HepG2 cell line stably expressing Prdx1 shRNA. Prdx1 silencing reversed, least partially, tumoural phenotype HepG2 cells, resulting morphological changes, delayed cell growth, down-regulation transcripts AFP, osteopontin beta-catenin decreased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, oppositely up-regulation transcripts E-cadherin proapoptotic proteins (BAX, CASP3) increased alkaline phosphatase CASP3 activities. Proteomic profiling identified 16 spots differentially expressed Prdx1-silenced cells. variations involved down-regulation proteins pivotal roles cell proliferation differentiation, agreement observed phenotypic changes. also investigated effect Prdx1 silencing thiol protein oxidation. Proteins prone reversible cysteine oxidation play major physiological functions. Notably, down-regulation altered redox status key enzymes carbohydrate amino acid metabolism suggested disturbance Warburg effect glutamine utilization, two major pathways proliferation tumour cells. Overall, observations suggest PRDX1 acts pro-cancer protein HCC HepG2 cells.
