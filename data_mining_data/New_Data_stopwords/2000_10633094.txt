 Wild-type Escherichia coli K-12 ferments glucose mixture ethanol acetic, lactic, formic, succinic acids. anoxic chemostat culture four dilution rates two different oxidoreduction potentials (ORP), strain generated spectrum products depended ORP. Whatever dilution rate tested, low reducing conditions (-100 mV), production formate, acetate, ethanol, lactate molar proportions approximately 2.5:1:1:0.3, high reducing conditions (-320 mV), production molar proportions 2:0.6:1:2. modification metabolic fluxes due ORP effect synthesis stability fermentation enzymes; thus, high reducing conditions, lactate dehydrogenase-specific activity increased factor 3 6. modifications concomitant threefold decrease acetyl-coenzyme (CoA) needed biomass synthesis 0.5- 5-fold decrease formate flux. Calculations carbon cofactor balances shown fermentation balanced extracellular ORP modify oxidoreduction state cofactors. this, concluded extracellular ORP could regulate specific enzyme activities acetyl-CoA needed biomass synthesis, modifies metabolic fluxes ATP yield, leading variation biomass synthesis.
