 Aspergillus niger gene encoding pyruvate kinase cloned heterologous hybridization using fragment corresponding yeast gene probe. primary structure gene, including 5' 3' flanking sequences, determined. structural part A. niger pkiA gene 2054 bp long interrupted seven putative introns. Splicing intron sequences results open reading frame 1578 bp, encoding protein 526 amino-acid residues molecular weight 58,130 Da. Extensive homology found pyruvate kinase A. nidulans; 33 amino acids different proteins. Transformation experiments using pyrA gene selection marker subcloned pkiA gene co-transforming marker led increased levels pyruvate kinase. Analysis transformants showed none transformants integration occurred pkiA locus. Predominantly co-integration pyrA- pkiA-containing plasmids found cases examined.
