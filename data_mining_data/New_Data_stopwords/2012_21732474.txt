 Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) recently found harbor genomic alterations. However, integrity mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within reprogrammed cells yet investigated. mtDNA mutations occur high rate contribute pathology number human disorders. Furthermore, lack mtDNA integrity may alter cellular bioenergetics limit efficient differentiation. demonstrated previously derivation iPSCs associated mitochondrial remodeling metabolic switch towards glycolysis. Here, discovered alterations mtDNA occur upon induction pluripotency. Massively parallel pyrosequencing mtDNA revealed human iPSCs derived young healthy donors harbored single base mtDNA mutations (substitutions, insertions, deletions), homoplasmic (in mtDNA molecules) heteroplasmic (in fraction mtDNAs), present parental cells. mtDNA modifications mostly common variants disease related. Moreover, iPSC lines bearing different mtDNA mutational loads maintained consistent human embryonic stem cell-like reprogramming energy metabolism. involved upregulation glycolytic enzymes, increased glucose-6-phosphate levels, over-expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 protein, reroutes bioenergetic flux toward glycolysis. Hence, mtDNA mutations within iPSCs may necessarily impair correct establishment pluripotency associated metabolic reprogramming. Nonetheless, occurrence pathogenic mtDNA modifications might important aspect monitor characterizing iPSC lines. Finally, speculate random rearrangement mtDNA molecules might prove beneficial derivation mutation-free iPSCs patients mtDNA disorders.
