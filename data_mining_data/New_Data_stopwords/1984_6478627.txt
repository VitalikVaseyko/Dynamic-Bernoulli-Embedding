 Erythrocytes individuals Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) fractionated Percoll density gradients. osmotic fragility, mean cell volume, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count cell morphology fractions showed gradients separate erythrocytes according age, older small spherocytes appearing dense fractions. Comparison well established parameters erythrocyte ageing, pyruvate kinase activity, acetylcholinesterase activity cell potassium content normal HS erythrocyte fractions similar age revealed abnormalities senescence HS erythrocytes splenectomy.
