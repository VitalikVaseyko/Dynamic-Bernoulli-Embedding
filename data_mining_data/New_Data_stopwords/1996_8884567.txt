 transplacental supply nutrients interrupted birth, diverts maternal metabolism lactation. birth, energy homeostasis rapidly regained milk nutrients supply newborn fatty acids ketone bodies required neonatal development. However, immediately birth onset suckling time lapse newborn undergoes unique kind starvation. period glucose scarce ketone bodies available owing delay ketogenesis. circumstances, newborn supplied another metabolic fuel, lactate, utilized source energy carbon skeletons. Neonatal rat lung, heart, liver brain utilize lactate energy production lipogenesis. Lactate also utilized brain human babies type glycogenosis. rat neurons astrocytes primary culture actively use lactate oxidizable substrate precursor phospholipids sterols. Lactate oxidation enhanced dichloroacetate, inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase neurons astrocytes, suggesting pyruvate dehydrogenase regulated differently type cell. Despite low activity enzyme newborn brain, pyruvate decarboxylation main fate glucose neurons astrocytes. occurrence yeast-like pyruvate decarboxylase activity neonatal brain may explain results.
