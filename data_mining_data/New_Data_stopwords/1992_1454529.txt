 rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene possesses two alternative tissue-specific promoters, located 472 bp apart; upstream L' promoter erythroid-specific downstream L promoter hepatocyte-specific. erythroid-specific L' promoter strongly active fetal liver day 17 gestation, activity rapidly decreases thereafter. L' promoter fragment spanning nucleotide -320 +10 respect cap site able direct weak erythroid-specific transcription cell-free system. used DNAse footprinting gel mobility shift assays characterize identify binding nuclear factors 17-day-old fetal liver adult liver nuclear extracts 320 bp fragment 5' flanking region gene vitro. Two clusters erythroid-specific interactions found. proximal cluster consists two GATA-1 binding sites -50 bp -65 bp transcription initiation site, immediately downstream CACC motif two G/C-rich elements. distal cluster cis-elements, located 130 bp upstream, corresponds two GATA-1 sequences. two sequences overlap NF1 motifs interacting ubiquitous NF1 transcriptional factors presence adult hepatic extracts. Furthermore, examined vivo protein-DNA interactions DMS footprinting livers 17-day-old rat fetuses adult rats. found sites characterized vitro occupied vivo. Therefore, adult liver L' promoter, although inactive, nevertheless interacts ubiquitous factors.
