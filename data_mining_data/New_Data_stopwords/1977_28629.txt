 1) intact Ehrlich ascites tumour cells anaerobic glycolytic flux rate pattern intermediates investigated different pH values extracellular medium. 2) predicted dependence lactic acid dehydrogenase equilibrium pH strong negative correlation log ([lactate]/[pyruvate]) pH found. 3) steady state fluxes glycolysis pH 8.0 7.4 rather equal, despite significant differences intracellular concentrations glycolytic intermediates. pH 8.0 concentrations ATP, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate lower, concentrations ADP, AMP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, triose phosphates, phosphoglycerates, phosphoenolpyruvate higher pH 7.4. 4) analysis pH dependent changes metabolites follows different mechanisms responsible maintaining equal actual activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase pH 7.4 8.0. 5) application linear theory enzymatic chains calculation control strength regulatory important enzymes results hexokinase evidently rate-limiting glycolysis, phosphofructokinase also significantly influencing glycolytic flux. Pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, hand, significantly affect rate overall glycolytic flux ascites.
