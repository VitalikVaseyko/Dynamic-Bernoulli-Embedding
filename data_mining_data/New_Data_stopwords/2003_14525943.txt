 Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) polyol pathway enzyme catalyzes conversion sorbitol fructose. Recent studies demonstrated activation aldose reductase, first enzyme polyol pathway, key response ischemia inhibition aldose reductase reduces myocardial ischemic injury. efforts understand role pathway affecting metabolism normoxic ischemic conditions, well ischemic injury myocardium, investigated importance SDH use specific inhibitor (SDI), CP-470,711. SDH inhibition increased glucose oxidation, whereas palmitate oxidation remained unaffected. Global ischemia increased myocardial SDH activity approximately 1.5 fold. tissue lactate/pyruvate ratio, measure cytosolic NADH/NAD+, reduced SDH inhibition normoxic ischemic conditions. ATP higher SDI hearts ischemia reperfusion. Creatine kinase release reperfusion, marker myocardial ischemic injury, markedly attenuated SDH-inhibited hearts. data indicate myocardial SDH activation component ischemic response interventions inhibit SDH protect ischemic myocardium. Furthermore, data identify SDH novel target adjunctive cardioprotective interventions.
