 fluxes HK/G6PDH PK/LDH coupled-enzymatic reactions quantified presence physiological concentrations (1-15 microM) polymerized non-polymerized microtubular protein (MTP) rat brain permeabilized yeast cell system. vitro enzymatic fluxes increased either polymerized nonpolymerized brain MTP mainly lower range MTP concentration. fixed MTP concentrations flux stimulatory range HK/G6PDH (1 mg/ml MTP) PK/LDH (0.4 mg/ml MTP), hyperbolic sigmoidal response NADP PEP, respectively, detected. dependence varied according polymeric status MTP. specificity phenomenon observed vitro, tested PK/LDH HK/G6PDH enzymatic couples presence neutral polymers glycogen (< = 10 mg/ml), poly(ethylene glycol) (up 10% w/w) G-actin (< = 1 mg/ml). permeabilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, PK-catalyzed flux sensitive microtubule disruption nocodazole (15 micrograms/ml). HK/G6PDH system affected nocodazole showing values kinetic parameters close obtained vitro presence polymerized brain MTP. Indirect immunofluorescence specific antibodies tubulin allowed confirm microtubules disruption presence nocodazole permeabilized yeast cells conditions enzymes assayed intracellularly. experimental evidence agreement observed phenomenon increase fluxes enzymatic reactions assayed specifically induced MTP either vitro situ. results presented discussed terms assembly large supramolecular structures supraregulatory mechanism synchronization systemic cellular processes metabolic fluxes.
