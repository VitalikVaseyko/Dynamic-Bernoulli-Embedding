 synthesis characterization guanosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (GTP alpha S) guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (GTP beta S) using chemical enzymatic methods described. GTP alpha (SP diastereomer) prepared enzymatically chemically synthesized mixture diastereomers guanosine 5'-O-(1-thiodiphosphate) (GDP alpha S) phosphoglycerate kinase. GTP alpha B (RP diastereomer) similarly synthesized succinyl-CoA synthetase back-digesting small amounts GTP alpha formed phosphoglycerate kinase. Guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) serves precursor GTP beta (SP diastereomer), prepared pyruvate kinase back-digesting glycerol kinase, GTP beta B (RP diastereomer), obtained acetate kinase back-digesting myosin. analogues gamma-32P labeled 32Pi exchange either phosphoglycerate kinase-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase succinyl-CoA synthetase. Finally, interaction four nucleotides acetate kinase, RNA polymerase, succinyl-CoA synthetase described.
