 Activities phosphorylase, hexokinase pyruvate kinase studied soluble fraction cells dissimilarly acting sceletal muscles intact rabbits tissues impaired neural impulsation (denervation, experimental allergic neuritis). Activity phosphorylase found 2.2-fold higher hexokinase--4-fold lower soluble fraction quick muscle compared slow muscle. Due denervation differences smoothed off. alterations hexokinase activity observed muscles rabbits experimental allergic neuritis impairment sensitive innervation denervation.
