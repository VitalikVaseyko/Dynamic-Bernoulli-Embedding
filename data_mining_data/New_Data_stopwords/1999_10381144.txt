 present study evaluated substrate competition fatty acids (FA) glucose kidney vivo relation operation "glucose-FA" "reverse glucose-FA" cycles. fed rats, neither inhibition adipocyte lipolysis 5-methylpyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (MPCA) inhibition mitochondrial long-chain FA oxidation 2-tetradecylglycidate (TDG) influenced renal ratio free/acylated carnitine percentage total renal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) active (dephosphorylated) form (PDHa). additional provision glucose, precursor synthesis malonyl-coenzyme (coA), influence renal PDHa activity renal ratio free acylated carnitine, implying FA oxidation maximally suppressed fed state. reverse glucose-FA cycle may therefore important suppressing renal FA oxidation fed state. 48 hours starvation, MPCA TDG decreased short- long-chain acylcarnitine concentrations (40% 50%, P < .01) elevated renal ratio free/acylated carnitine (2.5-fold, P < .001, 3.3-fold, P < .001, respectively), indicating FA oxidation increased starvation. Despite suppression renal FA oxidation, renal PDHa activity 48-hour starved rats partially restored treatment MPCA TDG. additional administration glucose remedy this. failure reverse completely effects prolonged starvation suppressing PDHC activity acute inhibition FA oxidation suggests additional regulatory mechanisms dampen PDHC response acute changes substrate supply. Estimations PDH kinase (PDK) activity renal mitochondria showed significant 1.7-fold stable increase (P < .01) 48 hours starvation. Analysis PDK pyruvate sensitivity renal mitochondria incubated respiratory substrate (5 mmol/L 2-oxoglutarate/0.5 mmol/L L-malate) showed pyruvate concentration required 50% activation substantially decreased starvation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis range PDHC activities demonstrated increased PDK activity concomitant significant (at least P < .01) 1.8-fold increase protein expression ubiquitously expressed PDK isoform, PDK2. hypothesize changes protein expression activity individual PDK isoforms may dictate renal response incoming FA lesterification v oxidation) modulation relationship glycolytic flux PDHC activity, thus provision precursor malonyl-coA production.
