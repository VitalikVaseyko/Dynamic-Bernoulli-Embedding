 BACKGROUND: Citramalate, chemical precursor industrially important methacrylic acid (MAA), synthesized using Escherichia coli overexpressing citramalate synthase (cimA gene). Deletion gltA encoding citrate synthase leuC encoding 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase critical achieving high citramalate yields. Acetate undesirable by-product potentially formed pyruvate acetyl-CoA, precursors citramalate aerobic growth E. coli. study investigated strategies minimize acetate maximize citramalate production E. coli mutants expressing cimA gene. RESULTS: Key knockouts minimized acetate formation included acetate kinase (ackA), phosphotransacetylase (pta), particular pyruvate oxidase (poxB). Deletion glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf) ATP synthase (atpFH) aimed improving glycolytic flux negatively impacted cell growth citramalate accumulation shake flasks. repetitive fed-batch process, E. coli gltA leuC ackA-pta poxB overexpressing cimA generated 54.1 g/L citramalate yield 0.64 g/g glucose (78% theoretical maximum yield), 1.4 g/L acetate 87 h. CONCLUSIONS: study identified gene deletions critical reducing acetate accumulation aerobic growth citramalate production metabolically engineered E. coli strains. citramalate yield final titer relative acetate end fed-batch process highest reported date (a mass ratio citramalate acetate nearly 40) without detrimental citramalate productivity, significantly improving potential process production five-carbon chemical.
