 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activated right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), causing increase glycolysis relative glucose oxidation impairs right ventricular function. stimulus PDK upregulation, isoform specificity, long-term effects PDK inhibition unknown. hypothesize FOXO1-mediated PDK4 upregulation causes bioenergetic impairment RV dysfunction, reversed dichloroacetate. Adult male Fawn-Hooded rats (FHR) pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH; age 6-12 months) compared age-matched controls. Glucose oxidation (GO) fatty acid oxidation (FAO) measured baseline acute dichloroacetate (1 mM x 40 min) isolated working hearts freshly dispersed RV myocytes. effects chronic dichloroacetate (0.75 g/L drinking water 6 months) cardiac output (CO) exercise capacity measured vivo. Expression PDK4 regulatory transcription factor, FOXO1, also measured FHR RV specimens PAH patients (n = 10). Microarray analysis 168 genes related glucose FA metabolism showed >4-fold upregulation PDK4, aldolase B, acyl-coenzyme oxidase. FOXO1 increased FHR RV, whereas HIF-1 alpha unaltered. PDK4 expression increased, inactivated form FOXO1 decreased human PAH RV (P < 0.01). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) inhibition RVH increased proton production reduced GO's contribution tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Acutely, dichloroacetate reduced RV proton production increased GO's contribution (relative FAO) TCA cycle ATP production FHR (P < 0.01). Chronically dichloroacetate decreased PDK4 FOXO1, thereby activating PDH increasing GO FHR. metabolic changes increased CO (84 +/- 14 vs. 69 +/- 14 ml/min, P < 0.05) treadmill-walking distance (239 +/- 20 vs. 171 +/- 22 m, P < 0.05). Chronic dichloroacetate inhibits FOXO1-induced PDK4 upregulation restores GO, leading improved bioenergetics RV function RVH.
