 previous cross-sectional survey, 15% shipyard painters found mild anemia granulocytopenia, mostly acquired since employment. Environmental studies suggested possible etiologic role ethylene glycol ethers, solvents men heavily exposed established myelotoxic potential. exclude alternative hypotheses, examine possible common patterns injury, identify potential risk factors markers effect, affected painters studied. painters matched two groups controls: exposed painters without evidence hematologic abnormality previous survey unexposed controls. Altogether 25 subjects studied histopathologic examination bone marrow, cytogenetic studies marrow cells, peripheral lymphocytes peripheral red cell studies membrane metabolic function. Except unexpected finding race-associated effect marrow histology, insignificant differences seen among groups terms marrow morphology cellularity, stem cell growth kinetics, marrow peripheral cytogenetics. Two metabolic abnormalities peripheral red cells related exposure clinical status subjects found. Pyruvate kinase, established marker acquired myelodysplasia, significantly depressed subjects previously abnormal counts. Although reduced glutathione levels holoenzyme activities glutathione reductase (GSHR) differ among groups, exposed subjects decreased saturation GSHR flavin adenine dinucleotide could restored vitro, suggesting riboflavin deficiency impaired riboflavin metabolism. Thus, although unique pattern bone marrow injury histologic genetic assay attributable ethylene glycol ethers defined, biochemical effects possible mechanistic importance identified. relevance findings subclinical disease markers remains established.
