 present study evaluates anti-hyperglycemic activity fractionated Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) seed extracts. Fasting blood glucose levels evaluated administration different fractions seed extract. Among three fractions tested, fraction Mc-3 (15 mg/kg b.wt.) showed maximum anti-hyperglycemic activity reduced blood glucose levels experimental diabetic rats significantly. activities key regulatory enzymes glucose metabolism (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) determined Mc-3-treated diabetic animals. Once-daily administration fraction Mc-3 prolonged period 18 days experimental diabetic animals result nephrotoxicity hepatotoxicity evident insignificant changes biochemical parameters indicative liver kidney functions. fractionation fraction Mc-3 size exclusion chromatography resulted fraction, designated Mc-3.2, possessing anti-hyperglycemic activity. fraction Mc-3.2 showed presence predominant protein band ~11 kDa SDS-PAGE. Loss anti-hyperglycemic activity Mc-3.2 upon protease treatment indicates proteinaceous nature anti-hyperglycemic principles. Overall, results suggest Momordica charantia seeds contain effective anti-hyperglycemic protein(s) may find application treatment diabetes without evident toxic effects.
