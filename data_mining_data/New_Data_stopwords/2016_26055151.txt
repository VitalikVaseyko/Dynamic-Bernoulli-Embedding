 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) centrally involved cancer progression, including proliferation, apoptosis invasion. However, expression pattern possible cellular functions human colorectal cancer remain unclear. present study, show PDK1 expression up-regulated mRNA protein levels colorectal cancer clinical specimens cell lines. Transient knockdown PDK1 suppresses cellular growth, induces cellular apoptosis causes abnormal cell cycle distribution. Meanwhile, decreased PDK1 level closely associated reduced Akt/cyclin D1 activity. Activating AKT activity reintroducing cyclin D1 expression significantly compromised oncogenic activity induced PDK1. Together, findings elucidate key role PDK1 colorectal cellular functions trigged Akt/cyclin D1 pathway, thus providing novel insight PDK1 colorectal carcinogenesis.
