 recently identified nicotinamide riboside kinases (Nrks) constitute distinct pathway nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. present combination established optical adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) test, pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system, Nrk-catalyzed reaction determine kinetic properties enzymes, particular affinities ATP. assay allows variation nucleoside phosphate donor substrates, thereby providing major advantages characterization enzymes. confirm previously established kinetic parameters identify differences substrate selectivity two human Nrk isoforms. proposed assay inexpensive may applied high-throughput screening.
