 study investigated ameliorative effect gallic acid (GA) hypertriglyceridemia fat accumulation perirenal adipose tissues high-fructose diet (HFD)-induced diabetic rats. previous results showed orally administered GA (30 mg/kg body weight) four weeks significantly reduced levels plasma glucose triglyceride (TG) HFD rats. GA also markedly decreased perirenal adipose tissues weight HFD rats present study (p < 0.05). Western blot assay indicated GA restored expression insulin signaling-related proteins, insulin receptor (IR), protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-zeta), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) perirenal adipose tissues HFD rats. Moreover, GA enhanced expression glycolysis-related proteins, phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK), increased expression lipolysis-related proteins, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), involved lipolysis perirenal adipose tissues HFD rats. study revealed GA may alleviate hypertriglyceridemia fat accumulation enhancing glycolysis lipolysis pathways perirenal adipose tissues HFD rats. findings also suggest potential GA preventing progression diabetes mellitus (DM) complications.
