 Cancer cells proliferative advantage utilizing intermediates aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) macromolecule synthesis. Although exact causes Warburg effect unclear, high osmotic stress solid tumor microenvironment considered one important factors. Oleanolic acid (OA) known exert anti-inflammatory anti-cancer effect. current studies, using breast cancer cell lines, determined protective role OA high salt-mediated osmotic stress-induced cancer growth. Hypertonic (0.16 NaCl) culture conditions enhanced cancer cell growth (26 %, p < 0.05) aerobic glycolysis marked increased glucose consumption (34 %, p < 0.05) lactate production (25 %, p < 0.05) untreated cells. effect associated increased expression activity key rate-limiting enzymes aerobic glycolysis, namely hexokinase, pyruvate kinase type M2, lactate dehydrogenase A. Interestingly, high salt-mediated enhanced expression aerobic glycolytic enzymes efficiently reversed OA along decreased cancer cell proliferation. cancer cells, enhanced aerobic glycolysis associated decreased mitochondrial activity mitochondrial-associated caspase activity. expected, high salt inhibited mitochondrial related cytochrome oxidase caspase-3 activity. However, OA efficiently reversed high salt-mediated inhibition cytochrome oxidase, caspase activity, pro-apoptotic Bax expression, thus suggesting OA induced mitochondrial activity enhanced apoptosis. Taken together, data indicate OA efficiently reverses enhanced Warburg-like metabolism induced high salt-mediated osmotic stress along potential application OA anti-cancer therapy.
