 study conducted determine time course metabolic changes associated switch high-fat low-fat diet rats. Adult rats, maintained high-fat diet (42% energy fat) 4-5 weeks switched low-fat diet (11% energy fat), activities several liver enzymes followed. Three different phases could distinguished. early phase, complete 2 days switch diets, included increase activity glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (pentose phosphate pathway), increase pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase activities (terminal end glycolytic pathway) increase ATP-citrate lyase fatty acid synthetase (fatty acid synthesis pathway). early phase also included decrease activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, gluconeogenesis) lower branched-chain amino acid dehydrogenase activity (BCAADH, branched-chain amino acid degradation). concentration allosteric phosphofructokinase regulator, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2, glycolysis), decreased early phase. intermediate phase could also discerned 3 10 days switch diets. phase, decreased Fru-2,6-P2 concentration decreased PEPCK BCAADH activities observed early phase reversed. late phase occurred 10 days dietary switch characterized increase activities glucokinase (glycolytic pathway) glycogen phosphorylase (associated glycogenolysis) decrease glutamate dehydrogenase, PEPCK BCAADH activities. measurements indicate least 20 days required metabolic changes associated switch diet complete.
