 Armored catfish (Liposarcus pardalis), indigenous Amazon basin, hearts extremely tolerant oxygen limitation. test hypothesis resistance hypoxia associated increases binding selected glycolytic enzymes subcellular fractions. Preparations isolated ventricular sheets subjected 2 h either oxygenated hypoxic (via nitrogen gassing) treatment time muscle stimulated contract. bathing medium contained 5 mM glucose maintained 25 degrees C. Initial experiments revealed increases anaerobic metabolism. measurable decrease glycogen level; however, hypoxic treatment led twofold increase heart glucose 10-fold increase lactate content. suggested increase heart glucose content result enhanced rate facilitated glucose transport exceeds rate phosphorylation glucose. experiments assessed activities metabolic enzymes crude homogenates subsequently tracked degree enzyme binding associated subcellular fractions. Total maximal activities glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase [HK], phosphofructokinase [PFK], aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), mitochondrial marker, citrate synthase, altered hypoxic treatment. substantial portion (>/=50%) HK permanently bound mitochondria, level increases hypoxia. amount HK bound mitochondrial fraction least fourfold higher hearts L. pardalis rat hearts. Hypoxia also resulted increased binding PFK particulate fraction, degree binding higher hypoxia-tolerant fish hypoxia-sensitive mammalian hearts. binding may associated increased glycolytic flux rates modulation enzyme-specific kinetics. binding HK PFK occurs significant decrease glycogen level.
