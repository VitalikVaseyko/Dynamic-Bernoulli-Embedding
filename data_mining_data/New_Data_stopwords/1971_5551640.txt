 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) Azotobacter vinelandii, like corresponding enzyme organisms, activated acetyl coenzyme inhibited l-aspartate. modifiers affect primarily affinity enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate. first enzyme strictly anaplerotic (intermediate-replacing) function tested response adenylate energy charge; entirely insensitive variation charge. results suggest carboxylation phosphoenolpyruvate organism controlled negative feedback aspartate stimulatory effect acetyl coenzyme A. adenylate energy charge may expected affect rate reaction indirectly effects concentrations acetyl coenzyme l-aspartate.
