 Warburg effect ameliorated culturing transformed cells presence galactose instead glucose primary carbon source. However, metabolic consequences may occur addition sensitizing cells mitochondrial toxins. screening pharmaceutical agents transformed cells using galactose must therefore carefully evaluated. Pioglitazone employed clinical applications treat type-2 diabetes clearly off-target effects. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) cultured glucose galactose-containing medium investigate role pioglitazone cellular bioenergetics calorimetry respirometry. Compared cells cultured 10 mM glucose, HepG2 cells cultured presence 10 mM galactose showed decreased metabolic activity measured cellular heat flow. Interestingly, cellular heat flow increased addition pioglitazone cells cultured glucose, cells cultured galactose. calorimetric data indicated reduction cellular capacity glycolysis mechanism responsible increase sensitivity pioglitazone, possibly mitochondrial toxins general, cells cultured galactose. Furthermore, oxygen consumption rates decreased addition pioglitazone cells grown glucose remained unchanged cells grown presence galactose. demonstrated pioglitazone induces reduction mitochondrial activity partially compensated via increase glycolysis presence glucose.
