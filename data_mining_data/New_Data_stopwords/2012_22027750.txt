 OBJECTIVE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) paclitaxel (T) cisplatin (P) commonly used treatment cervical cancer. However, little known antineoplastic mechanism NAC TP patient tissues situ. study, compared proteomic profiles cervical cancer patients NAC TP identify proteins may shed light mechanism TP action. METHODS: collected cervical cancer tissues pre- post-NAC TP 6 patients local advanced cervical cancer stored -80 degrees C. Proteomes 2 groups cervical cancer tissues analyzed 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis differentially expressed proteins identified matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. proteins differentially expressed confirmed Western blot. RESULTS: 13 proteins whose levels significantly altered NAC TP. Compared pre-NAC, 11 proteins down-regulated, 2 proteins up-regulated post-NAC group. down-regulated proteins aldolase A, pyruvate kinase, enolase 1, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), HSP70, actinin alpha1, lamin B1, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1gamma, annexin 1, epithelial cell marker protein1, keratin II-type. contrast, apolipoprotein A1 annexin V up-regulated. down-regulation HSP27, HSP70, enolase 1, aldolase verified Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: Differentially expressed proteins cervical cancer tissues pre- post-NAC TP identified comparative proteomic approach. NAC therapy TP down-regulated proteins involved energy production (glycolytic enzymes) chaperones up-regulated proteins involved apoptosis. findings shed new light biomarkers associated effect chemotherapy.
