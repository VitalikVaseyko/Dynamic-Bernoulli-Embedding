 interaction monovalent cation wild type (WT) yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK) T298S, T298C, T298A mutants investigated 205Tl+ NMR monitor possible structural alterations active site Thr-298 mutation. TlNO3 activates WT YPK kcat value similar obtained KCl apparent Ka 0.96 +/- 0.07 mm presence Mn2+ fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. three mutants, Tl+ better activator K+ based kcat values. Tl+ activation inhibition YPK affected mutation active site Thr-298. effect Mn2+ 1/T value 205Tl+1 presence WT mutant YPK complexes determined 173 MHz (300 MHz, 1H) 346 MHz (600 MHz, 1H). complex studied, 1/pT2p >> 1/pT1p 1/pT1p frequency-dependent suggesting fast exchange conditions. values 1/pT1p differ mutant. correlation time 0.65 +/- 0.35 ns estimated Mn2+-205Tl+ interaction. Tl+-Mn2+ distances active site YPK calculated paramagnetic contribution Mn2+ 1/T1M YPK-bound 205Tl+. calculated Tl+-Mn2+ distance Thr-298 mutants decreased 1 6.0 +/- 0.2 observed WT. results suggest conformational alterations active site YPK phosphoryl transfer occurs upon mutation Thr-298. conformational changes may, part, explain alteration kcat kcat/Km,PEP observed Thr-298 mutants.
