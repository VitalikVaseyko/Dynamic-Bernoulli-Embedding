 Many cancer cells demonstrate high rate glucose consumption via glycolysis provide intermediates macromolecule biosynthesis. accomplish metabolic change, expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) rapidly increased cancer cells. Inhibition PDKs could promote function mitochondria increasing oxidative metabolism pyruvate, resulting death cancer cells. review, provide overview structural information available PDKs connections known therapeutic effects. describe development small molecule PDK inhibitors medicinal chemistry particular emphasis anticancer agents. Finally, directions development PDK inhibitors potential anticancer agents discussed.
