 metabolic properties mitochondria rat cerebral cortex olfactory bulb investigated. pyruvate-supported oxygen uptake rates olfactory bulb mitochondria significantly lower cerebrocortical mitochondria. consistent differences pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activities mitochondrial preparations. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, hexokinase activities olfactory bulb mitochondria significantly lower cerebrocortical mitochondria. However, NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, NAD-linked NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase activities olfactory bulb mitochondria significantly higher cerebrocortical mitochondria. differences two mitochondrial preparations terms activities energy-metabolizing enzymes reflect differences detected homogenates regions.
