 experimental myocardial ischemia rats 10 months treatment mildronate resulted essential changes metabolism cardiomyocites. includes stimulation aerobic anaerobic ways power supply heart cells: activation glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation oxidative pyruvate decarboxylation restoration adenosine triphosphate pool intact rats level myocardium, serum erythrocytes signs stabilization cardiomyocytes membranes essential decrease tissue hypoxia. Introduction mildronate old rats (24 months) experimental myocardium ischemia accompanied lesser expressed changes metabolism: activation glycolysis oxidative pyruvate decarboxylation without stimulation Crebs' cycle enzymes. became sufficient restoration adenosine triphosphate pool myocardium without change quantity serum erythrocytes signs stabilization cardiomyocytes membranes moderate reduction tissue hypoxia degree.
