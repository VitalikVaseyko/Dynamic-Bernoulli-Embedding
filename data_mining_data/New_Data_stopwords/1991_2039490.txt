 relation expression LF-B1 gene L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) mRNA level rat liver hepatoma cells investigated. L-PK mRNA level rat liver changed partial hepatectomy, development intake high carbohydrate diet, level LF-B1 mRNA remained unchanged altered reciprocally. Dedifferentiated AH-130 cells, express L-PK mRNA, expressed LF-B1 mRNA. results suggest transcription pyruvate kinase L gene simply regulated level LF-B1 mRNA.
