 Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) plays important role integrating cell antigen receptor (TCR) CD28 signals achieve efficient NF-kappaB activation. PDK1 also important regulator cell development, mediating pre-TCR induced proliferation signals. However, role PDK1 B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling B cell development remains largely unknown. study provide genetic evidence supporting role PDK1 B cell survival. found PDK1 required BCR mediated survival resting B cells, likely regulation Foxo activation. PDK1-dependent signaling NF-kappaB crucial resting B cell viability. However, PDK1 necessary triggering NF-kappaB B cell activation required activated B cell survival. Together studies demonstrate PDK1 essential BCR-induced signal transduction Foxo NF-kappaB indispensable resting activated B cell survival.
