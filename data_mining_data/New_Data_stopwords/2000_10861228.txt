 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) primary regulator flux mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Although PDKs inactivate mitochondrial PDC phosphorylating specific Ser residues, primary amino acid sequence indicates closely related prokaryotic kinases eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinases. Unlike Ser/Thr kinases, kinases use conserved residue phosphotransfer Asp residues. understand unique kinases better, presumptive PDK Arabidopsis thaliana heterologously expressed purified investigation. Purified, recombinant A. thaliana PDK could inactivate kinase-depleted maize mitochondrial PDC phosphorylating Ser residues. Additionally, A. thaliana PDK capable autophosphorylating Ser residues near N-terminus, although reaction part phosphotransfer pathway. elucidate mechanism involved, performed site-directed mutagenesis canonical residue likely involved phosphotransfer. His-121 mutated Ala Gln, Ser-autophosphorylation decreased 50% transphosphorylation PDC decreased concomitantly. postulate either (1) His-121 sole phosphotransfer residue (2) mutagenesis His-121 exposes additional otherwise cryptic phosphotransfer residue. Thus His-121 one residue involved kinase function.
