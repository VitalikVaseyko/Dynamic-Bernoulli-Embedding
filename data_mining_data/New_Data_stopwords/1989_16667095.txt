 study, measured total pool sizes key cellular metabolites nitrogen-limited cells Selenastrum minutum ammonium assimilation light. carried identify sites N assimilation acting regulate carbon metabolism. 120 seconds following NH(4) (+) addition found that: (a) N accumulated glutamine glutamate alpha-ketoglutarate levels fell; (b) ATP levels declined within 5 seconds recovered within 30 seconds NH(4) (+) addition; (c) ratios pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate, malate/phosphoenolpyruvate, Glc-1-P/Glc-6-P Fru-1,6-bisphosphate/Fru-6-P increased; (d) previously seen, photosynthetic carbon fixation inhibited. Further, monitored starch degradation N assimilation longer time course found starch breakdown occurred rate 110 micromoles glucose per milligram chlorophyll per hour. results consistent N assimilation occurring glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase expense carbon previously stored starch. also indicate regulation several enzymes involved shift metabolism photosynthetic carbon assimilation carbohydrate oxidation N assimilation. seems likely pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, starch degradation activated, whereas key Calvin cycle enzyme(s) inactivated within seconds NH(4) (+) addition N-limited S. minutum cells. rapid changes glutamate triose phosphate, recently shown regulators cytosolic pyruvate kinase, consistent contributing short-term activation enzyme.
