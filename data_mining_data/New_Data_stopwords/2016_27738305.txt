 review article deals analysis detection morphological features associated somatic mutations, mostly BRAFV600E mutation, cytological histological samples carcinomas. authors demonstrated architectural specific cellular findings (i.e. polygonal eosinophilic cells defined "plump cells" sickle-shaped nuclei) able predict BRAF V600E mutation cytological histological samples papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) well carcinomas. current review article evaluated first comprehensive analysis morphological prediction BRAFV600E somatic mutations different malignant lesions description possible mechanisms beneath morphologic features. detection predictive morphological features, mostly FNAC, may add helpful information stratification malignant risk personalized management cancers. Additionally, knowledge molecular mechanism different oncogenic drivers lead organ-specific triaging selection cases provide significant insight targeted therapies different malignant lesions.
