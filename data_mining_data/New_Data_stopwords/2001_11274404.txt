 SF3b(155) essential spliceosomal protein, highly conserved evolution. identified subunit splicing factor SF3b, which, together second multimeric complex termed SF3a, interacts specifically 12S U2 snRNP converts active 17S form. protein displays characteristic intranuclear localization. diffusely distributed nucleoplasm highly concentrated defined intranuclear structures termed "speckles," subnuclear compartment enriched small ribonucleoprotein particles various splicing factors. primary sequence SF3b(155) suggests multidomain structure, different nuclear speckles components. identify part SF3b(155) determines specific intranuclear localization, constructed expression vectors encoding series epitope-tagged SF3b(155) deletion mutants well chimeric combinations SF3b(155) sequences soluble cytoplasmic protein pyruvate kinase. Following transfection cultured mammalian cells, identified (i) functional nuclear localization signal monopartite type (KRKRR, amino acids 196--200) (ii) molecular segment multiple threonine-proline repeats (amino acids 208--513), essential sufficient confer specific accumulation nuclear speckles. latter sequence element, particular amino acids 208--440, required correct subcellular localization SF3b(155) also sufficient target reporter protein nuclear speckles. Moreover, "speckle-targeting sequence" transfers capacity interaction U2 snRNP components.
