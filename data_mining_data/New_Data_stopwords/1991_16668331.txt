 Two cDNA clones, PK(p)alpha PK(p)beta, leucoplast isozyme pyruvate kinase isolated characterized. Southern blot castor (Ricinus communis) DNA probed PK(p)alpha indicates presence single gene PK(p). (1610 base pairs) sequence cDNAs identical. 1610 base pairs begin ATG translation initiation codon, 248 base pairs 3'-untranslated 1362 base pairs coding sequence. sequences two clones 5'- identical regions different encode peptides high percentage hydrophobic amino acids. derived sequence PK(p)alpha encodes eight amino acid residues identified amino-terminus one subunit PK(p) castor seed leucoplasts enzyme purified absence cysteine endopeptidase inhibitors. sequence upstream amino acids possibly transit peptide protein. PK(p) extracted conditions eliminate proteolytic degradation, alpha-subunit relative molecular weight equal full-length coding sequence PK(p)alpha. data indicate transit peptide subunit leucoplast pyruvate kinase encoded PK(p)alpha cleaved protein released plastid. derived amino acid sequences PK(p)alpha PK(p)beta closely related Escherichia coli pyruvate kinase. Although residues involved substrate binding conserved leucoplast pyruvate kinase, phosphorylation site 5 15 amino acids E. coli fructose-1,6-bisphosphate binding site conserved.
