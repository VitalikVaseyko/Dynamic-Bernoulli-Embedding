 Altered metabolism cancer cells pivotal tumor growth, notably providing energy, reducing equivalents building blocks several metabolites exert signaling function promoting tumor growth progression. cancer tissue cannot simply reduced bulk proliferating cells. Tumors indeed complex dynamic structures single cells heterogeneously perform various biological activities different metabolic requirements. tumors composed different types cells metabolic activities affected different spatial temporal contexts, important address metabolism taking account cellular biological heterogeneity. review, describe heterogeneity also metabolic fluxes, thus showing relative contribution different metabolic activities tumor progression according cellular context. article part Special Issue entitled Mitochondria Cancer, edited Giuseppe Gasparre, Rodrigue Rossignol Pierre Sonveaux.
