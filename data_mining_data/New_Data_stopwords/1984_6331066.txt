 effect immobilization plaster cast studied activities phosphoglucomutase (PGM), pyruvate kinase ( PyK ) cAMP-dependent protein kinase fast (extensor digitorum longus [EDL]), slow (soleus) muscles rats. control untreated animals, PGM PyK activities 3 5 fold higher respectively EDL soleus correlation high glycolytic activity fast muscles. four weeks period immobilization 20% decrease occurred PGM activity, limiting role glycolysis attributed, PyK regulatory function, showed 35% decrease EDL; time soleus activity enzymes change. decrease PGM PyK activity EDL diminished difference slow fast muscles, evaluated tendency dedifferentiation (transformation). activity cAMP-dependent protein kinase, contrast glycolytic enzymes, higher soleus EDL immobilization change significantly either muscles.
