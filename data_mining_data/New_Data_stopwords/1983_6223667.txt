 kinetics reversible inactivation chloroplast CF1-ATPase Mg2+ ADP studied. rate inactivation obeys first-order equation independent ADP concentration. analysis dependence inactivation rate Mg2+ concentration demonstrated limiting step inactivation Mg2+ binding, i.e. subsequent steps include, probability, conformational changes enzyme. original Mg2+-dependent activity CF1-ATPase close observed steady-state conditions presence sulphate methanol exceeds Ca2+-dependent activity approximately 6-fold. Preincubation CF1-ATPase Mg2+ results inhibition original activity enzyme. effect removed addition ATP-regenerating system (pyruvate kinase + phosphoenol pyruvate) preincubation medium diminished sulphite non-hydrolyzed analog ATP--beta, gamma-methyladenosine-5-triphosphate. addition AMPPCP reaction mixture initial reaction rate decreased, steady-state rate increased. may concluded Mg2+-dependent inactivation CF1-ATPase induced tightly bound ADP. latter replaced ATP, contrast ADP form inactive complex enzyme. comparison experimental results literature data suggests mechanism "alternating sites" proposed Boyer et al. ATP hydrolysis soluble CF1-ATPase realized given experimental conditions.
