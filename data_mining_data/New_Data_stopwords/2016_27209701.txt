 BACKGROUND: Concurrence high glucose diabetes patients dyslipidemia presenting major challenges clinicians. Although sporadically reported, rational basis use fibrates treatment dyslipidemia concurrent metabolic syndrome established. METHODS: study, wild-type (WT) Ppara-null (KO) mice fed serial gemfibrozil- fenofibrate-containing diet experimental conditions 14 days. Glucose level blood, glycogen storage liver tissues, potential toxic responses assayed. Genes involved glucose metabolism determined quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: blood glucose level glycogen content liver down-regulated gemfibrozil fenofibrate WT mice, dose-dependent manner. decrement occur KO mice either fibrate agent. Secondary regulation transcription pyruvate kinase, gluconolactonase observed following gemfibrozil treatment, differential WT mice KO mice. CONCLUSIONS: Gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, down-regulates systemic glucose level glycogen storage liver dependent PPARalpha, suggesting potential value treatment dyslipidemia concurrent diabetes high glucose levels.
