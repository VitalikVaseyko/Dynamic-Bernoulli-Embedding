 Late committed progenitor cells erythropoiesis, CFU-E (colony-forming unit--erythroid), isolated mouse spleens near homogeneity three-step enrichment procedure. procedure included four-day pretreatment bled mice antibiotic thiamphenicol, recovery period 3 1/2 days, followed centrifugal elutriation Percoll density gradient centrifugation spleen cells. practically pure CFU-E population used study aspects erythroid differentiation vitro. Colony growth, well morphology glycolytic enzyme activities cells isolated selected times 48-hour culture period, determined. Marked declining activities several enzymes, including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, observed vitro differentiation. activity diphosphoglycerate mutase almost absent CFU-E, progressively increased differentiation. isozyme distribution aldolase enolase change CFU-E vitro differentiation reticulocyte. Hexokinase (HK) CFU-E contained mainly double-banded type isozyme, addition minor amount HK II. differentiation, shift noticed within double-banded HK region, whereas HK ii disappeared one cell division. Pyruvate kinase CFU-E characterized presence K-type L-type isozyme hybrids isozyme types. vitro differentiation, production K-type isozyme rapidly stops favor L type.
