 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells, variety normal cells, exhibit aerobic glycolysis, high rates glucose fermentation presence normal oxygen concentrations, also known Warburg effect. metabolism considered abnormal violates standard model cellular energy production assumes glucose metabolism predominantly governed oxygen concentrations and, therefore, fermentative glycolysis emergency back-up periods hypoxia. Though several hypotheses proposed origin aerobic glycolysis, biological basis cancer normal cells still well understood. RESULTS: examined changes glucose metabolism following perturbations membrane activity different normal tumor cell lines found inhibition activation pumps cell membrane led reduction increase glycolysis, respectively, oxidative phosphorylation remained unchanged. Computational simulations demonstrated findings consistent new model normal physiological cellular metabolism efficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation supplies chronic energy demand primarily macromolecule synthesis glycolysis necessary supply rapid energy demands primarily support membrane pumps. specific model prediction spatial distribution ATP-producing enzymes glycolytic pathway must primarily localized adjacent cell membrane, mitochondria predominantly peri-nuclear. predictions confirmed experimentally. CONCLUSIONS: results show glycolytic metabolism serves critical physiological function normoxic conditions responding rapid energetic demand, mainly membrane transport activities, even presence oxygen. supports new model glucose metabolism glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation supply different types energy demand. Cells use efficient slow-responding aerobic metabolism meet baseline, steady energy demand glycolytic metabolism, inefficient rapidly increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, meet short-timescale energy demands, mainly membrane transport activities. model, origin Warburg effect cancer cells aerobic glycolysis general represents normal physiological function due enhanced energy demand membrane transporters activity required cell division, growth, migration.
