 studied red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) variants eight patients representing five families pyruvate kinase deficiency-associated hemolytic anemia. kinetic properties, electrophoretic mobilities, immunological reactivity anti-normal red cell pyruvate kinase determined. patients differ severity clinical condition molecular properties red cell pyruvate kinase variants. seriously affected patient (PK Beaverton) electrophoretically demonstrable red cell isozymes. activity present due M2 isozyme, however red cell isozyme detected immunologically. PK Molalla PK Lake Oswego thermolabile variants normal kinetic parameters. PK Molalla, addition, altered electrophoretic mobility. PK Multnomah PK Milwaukie decreased affinity substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, PK Multnomah also altered electrophoretic mobility. PK Coos Bay shows electrophoretic variation slightly decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate consistent increased modulating effect fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
