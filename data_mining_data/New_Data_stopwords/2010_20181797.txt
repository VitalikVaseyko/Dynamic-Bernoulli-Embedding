 Glucocorticoids increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) mRNA protein expression, phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby preventing formed pyruvate undergoing mitochondrial oxidation. increase PDK4 expression mediated mandatory presence Forkhead box factors (FoxOs) nucleus. current study, examined importance nongenomic effects dexamethasone (Dx) determining compartmentalization FoxO hence transcriptional activity. Rat cardiomyocytes exposed Dx produced robust decrease glucose oxidation. Measurement FoxO compartmentalization demonstrated increase nuclear resultant decrease cytosolic content FoxO1 change total content. increase nuclear content FoxO1 correlated increase nuclear phospho-p38 MAPK together robust association transcription factor kinase. Dx also promoted nuclear retention FoxO1 decrease phosphorylation Akt, effect mediated heat shock proteins binding Akt. Measurement nuclear total expression sirtuin-1 protein showed change Dx. Instead, Dx increased association sirtuin-1 FoxO1, thereby causing decrease FoxO acetylation. Manipulation FoxO1 agents interfere nuclear shuttling acetylation effective reducing Dx-induced increase PDK4 protein expression. data suggest FoxO1 major PDK4-regulating function. addition, given recent suggestions altering glucose use set stage heart failure, manipulating FoxO could assist devising new therapeutic strategies optimize cardiac metabolism prevent PDK4 induced cardiac complications.
