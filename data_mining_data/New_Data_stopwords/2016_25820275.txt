 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) common fatal motor neuron disease adults. Numerous studies indicate ALS systemic disease affects whole body physiology metabolic homeostasis. Using mouse model disease (SOD1(G86R)), investigated muscle physiology motor behavior respect muscle metabolic capacity. found 65 days age, age described asymptomatic, SOD1(G86R) mice presented improved endurance capacity associated early inhibition capacity glycolytic muscle use glucose source energy switch fuel preference toward lipids. Indeed, glycolytic muscles showed progressive induction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression. Phosphofructokinase 1 inhibited, expression lipid handling molecules increased. mechanism represents chronic pathologic alteration muscle metabolism exacerbated disease progression. Further, inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 activity dichloroacetate delayed symptom onset improving mitochondrial dysfunction ameliorating muscle denervation. study, provide first molecular basis particular sensitivity glycolytic muscles ALS pathology.
