 Drosophila dMyc (dMyc) known role cell-autonomous regulation growth. address role fat body (FB), metabolic tissue functions sensor circulating nutrients control release Drosophila Insulin-like peptides (Dilps) brain influencing growth development. results show expression dMyc FB affects development animal size. Expression dMyc, CycD/cdk4 Rheb, FB diminishes ability retain Drosophila Insulin-like peptide-2 (DILP2) brain starvation, suggesting expression dMyc mimics signal remotely controls release Dilps hemolymph. dMyc also affects glucose metabolism increases transcription Glucose-transporter-1 mRNA, Hexokinase Pyruvate-Kinase mRNAs, key regulators glycolysis. animals able counteract increased levels circulating trehalose induced high sugar diet leading conclusion dMyc activity FB promotes glucose disposal. dMyc expression induces cell autonomous accumulation triglycerides, correlates increased levels Fatty Acid Synthase Acetyl CoA Carboxylase mRNAs, enzymes responsible lipid synthesis. also found expression Stearoyl-CoA desaturase, Desat1 mRNA significantly higher FB overexpressing dMyc. Desat1 enzyme necessary monosaturation production fatty acids, reduction affects dMyc's ability induce fat storage resistance animal survival. conclusion, present novel evidences dMyc function Drosophila FB controlling systemic growth. discovered dMyc expression triggers cell autonomous mechanisms control glucose lipid metabolism favor storage nutrients (lipids sugars). addition, regulation Desat1 controls synthesis triglycerides FB may affect humoral signal controls DILP2 release brain.
