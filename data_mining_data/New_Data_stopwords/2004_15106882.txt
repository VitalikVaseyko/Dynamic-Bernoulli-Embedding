 enzyme adenosine kinase (AK) exhibits nearly complete dependency presence pentavalent ions (PVI) phosphate, arsenate, vanadate. understand basis, effect large number phosphorylated compounds AK activity examined. Several compounds, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, phosphoenol pyruvate, creatine phosphate, phosphorous acid, phosphonoformic acid, inorganic pyrophosphate, found substitute PVI stimulating AK activity. Similar PVI, compounds lowered Km AK adenosine. contrast, many structurally related compounds (i.e., phosphonoacetic acid, 2-carboxyethyl phosphonic acid, N-phosphonomethyl glycine, N-phosphonomethyl iminodiacetic acid) inhibited AK activity. compounds seemed compete activators binding AK. Structural comparisons different compounds indicate activating compounds contain net positive charge pentavalent atom (e.g., phosphorous), enable act acceptor nucleophilic group. suggest phosphate (or activator) bound near active site participates AK catalysis forming transient pentavalent intermediate nonbridging oxygen beta-phosphate ATP. interaction likely facilitates transfer gamma-phosphate ATP adenosine, thus accounting stimulating role PVI AK catalysis. insight provided studies concerning structural features activators inhibitors also prove helpful design potent inhibitors AK.
