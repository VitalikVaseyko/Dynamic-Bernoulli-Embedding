 nine unrelated Portuguese patients pyruvate kinase (PK) deficient anaemia, whose symptoms ranged mild chronic haemolytic anaemia severe anaemia presenting birth requiring multiple transfusions, PK-LR gene mutations identified correlated phenotypes. Five different mutations identified, three first time: missense mutation 1670G --> C exon 12 two 5' splice donor site (GT) mutations intron 8 [IVS8(+2)T --> G] intron 10 [IVS10(+1)G --> C]. Two previously described missense mutations, 1456C --> 993C --> A, also found. genotype/phenotype correlation showed patients two missense mutations missense mutation splicing mutation mild haemolytic anaemia. three patients severe anaemia, transfusion dependent splenectomy, homozygous splicing site mutations IVS10(+1)G --> C IVS8(+2)T --> G.
