 Cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis, instead oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism even presence oxygen. phenomenon aerobic glycolysis, referred "Warburg effect", commonly exists variety tumors. Recent studies demonstrate genetic factors oncogenes tumor suppressors microenvironmental factors spatial hypoxia acidosis regulate glycolytic metabolism cancer cells. Reciprocally, altered cancer cell metabolism modulate tumor microenvironment plays important roles cancer cell somatic evolution, metastasis, therapeutic response. article, review progression current understandings molecular interaction cancer cell metabolism tumor microenvironment. addition, discuss implications interactions cancer therapy chemoprevention.
