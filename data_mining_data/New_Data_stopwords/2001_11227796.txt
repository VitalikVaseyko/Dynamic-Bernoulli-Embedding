 specific interaction muscle type creatine-kinase (MM-CK) myofibrillar M-line demonstrated exchanging endogenous MM-CK excess fluorescently labeled MM-CK situ, using chemically skinned skeletal muscle fibers confocal microscopy. binding labeled MM-CK noticed I-band skinned fibers, enzyme additionally located vivo, shown earlier immunofluorescence staining cryosections intact muscle. However, rhodamine-labeled MM-CK diffused skinned fibers preincubated phosphofructokinase (PFK), glycolytic enzyme known bind actin, striking vivo-like interaction Rh-MM-CK I-band found, presumably mediated binding Rh-MM-CK glycolytic enzyme. Aldolase, another actin-binding glycolytic enzyme also able bind Rh-MM-CK I-band, formation complex occurred preferably long sarcomere length (> 3.0 microm). Neither pyruvate kinase, although known binding actin, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), directly interacting I-band itself, mediate I-band targeting MM-CK. Anchoring MM-CK I-band via PFK, via aldolase, strongly pH-dependent occurred pH 7.0. Labeling performed different sarcomere length indicated PFK/MM-CK complex bound thin filaments I-band, within actomyosin overlap zones. physiological consequences structural interaction MM-CK PFK I-band discussed respect functional coupling MM-CK glycolysis, metabolic regulation channeling multi-enzyme complexes. situ binding assay skinned skeletal muscle fibers described represents useful method studies specific protein-protein interactions structurally intact contractile system various precisely controlled conditions.
