 first half 20th century produced substantial breakthroughs bioenergetics mitochondria research. time, Otto Warburg observed abnormally high glycolysis lactate production oxygenated cancer cells, leading suggest defects mitochondrial functions heart malignant cell transformation. Warburg's hypothesis profoundly influenced present perception cancer metabolism, positioning termed aerobic glycolysis mainstream clinical oncology. ideas stood test time, also frequently generated misconceptions regarding biochemical mechanisms cell transformation. review examines experimental evidence supports refutes Warburg effect discusses possible advantages conferred cancer cells 'metabolic transformation'.
