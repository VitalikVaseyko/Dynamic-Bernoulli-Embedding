 Leptin reduces adiposity exerts antisteatotic effects nonadipose tissues. However, mechanisms underlying leptin effects lipid metabolism liver white adipose tissue fully clarified. Here, studied effects central leptin administration key enzymes transcription factors involved lipid metabolism liver epididymal adipose tissue. Intracerebroventricular leptin infusion 7 change leptin plasma levels decreased triacylglyceride content liver, epididymal adipose tissue, plasma. tissues treatment markedly decreased expression key enzymes de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis acetyl-coenzyme A-carboxylase, FA synthase, stearoyl-coenzyme desaturase-1, parallel reduction mRNA expression sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c liver carbohydrate regulatory element binding protein adipose tissue. addition, leptin also decreased phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase-C expression adipose tissue, enzyme involved glyceroneogenesis tissue. Central leptin administration down-regulates delta-6-desaturase expression liver adipose tissue, parallel decrease expression sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c liver peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha adipose tissue. Finally, leptin treatment, regulating adipose triglyceride lipase/hormone sensitive lipase/diacylglycerol transferase 1 expression, also established new partitioning FA-triacylglyceride cycling adipose tissue, increasing lipolysis probably FA efflux tissue, favoring parallel FA uptake oxidation liver. results suggest leptin, acting central level, exerts tissue-specific effects limiting fat tissue mass lipid accumulation nonadipose tissues, preventing development obesity type 2 diabetes.
