 logistic regression model, utilizing activities certain selected glycolytic enzymes ER status measured primary recurrent lesions, applied predict response combination chemotherapy regimens administered women advanced breast cancer. clinical outcome response response evaluated retrospectively using criteria employed cooperative group protocols. 93 cases, 58/61 patients classified nonresponders 22/32 patients demonstrating objective responses would correctly designated, based 50% estimated probability level separation responders nonresponders. overall predictive accuracy model 86%, apparently greater accuracy prediction lack response. Addition estrogen receptor status model imparted gain accuracy prediction. Application model prospective study warranted.
