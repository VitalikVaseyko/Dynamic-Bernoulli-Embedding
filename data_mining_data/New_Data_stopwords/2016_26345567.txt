 Cancer metabolism characterizes malignant behavior tumors. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), key player maintaining aerobic glycolysis, stimulates tumor growth controlling Warburg effect. shown PKM2 translocates nucleus regulate transcriptions numerous down-stream genes, including PDK1 LDHA. investigate significance PKM2 epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), biological process promotes metastasis cancer cells, induced EMT gastrointestinal cancer cells using TGFbeta EGF vitro. EMT induction, E-cadherin down-regulated, whereas Vimentin up-regulated. PKM2 expression increased transcriptional translational level, PKM2 translocated nucleus. Immunohistochemical staining PKM2 revealed PKM2 positivity correlated significantly lymph node metastasis distant organ metastasis gastrointestinal cancer. present results indicate nuclear PKM2 plays crucial role controlling invasion metastasis.
