 White New Zealand male rabbits fed high-cholesterol (1%) diet 7 weeks. activity alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine (AlaAT), aspartate (AspAT) aminotransferases level glucose blood plasma rabbits determined compared control group animals. cholesterol-enriched diet resulted increases plasma AlaAT AP activity decrease plasma glucose. liver, cholesterol treatment decreased activity AspAT, AlaAT, AP, phosphoglucomutase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. Activities glucosephosphate isomerase, aldolase level glycogen affected. statistically significant changes activity examined enzymes heart rabbits fed cholesterol-enriched diet observed. Chronic intake cholesterol diet negative effect liver metabolism heart metabolism rabbits.
