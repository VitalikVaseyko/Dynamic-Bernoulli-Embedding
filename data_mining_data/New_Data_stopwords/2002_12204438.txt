 Potassium pyrophosphate used instead ATP model ligand magnesium cation study effector influence kinetics pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M(1). pyruvate kinase activation low concentration pyrophosphate inhibition high concentration pyrophosphate considered result reversible reactions magnesium cation pyrophosphate, ADP, ATP, PEP. apparent K(m) V(m) cases pseudo-first order reaction rate constant (instead K(m) V(m)) pyruvate kinase given pyrophosphate concentration analysed function concentration free magnesium cation complexes ligands present assay mixture. functions reaction parameters respect concentration magnesium complexes indicate coexistence reaction mixture simple mixed complexes magnesium cation substrates, pyrophosphate, enzyme-substrate complex. parameters simulated reaction proposed interactions fit measured experimental data. simple model nonallosteric feedback proposed. According model, mutual simultaneous interactions reaction products substrates enzyme result coexistence simple mixed, labile inert complexes.
