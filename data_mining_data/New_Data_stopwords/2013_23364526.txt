 mechanisms regulate enhanced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity observed training reduced carbohydrate (CHO) availability currently unknown. aim present study test hypothesis reduced CHO availability enhances p53 signaling expression genes associated regulation mitochondrial biogenesis substrate utilization human skeletal muscle. repeated-measures design, muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) obtained eight active males performing acute bout high-intensity interval running either high (HIGH) low CHO availability (LOW). Resting muscle glycogen (HIGH, 467 +/- 19; LOW, 103 +/- 9 mmol/kg dry wt) greater HIGH compared LOW (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation (P-) ACC(Ser79) (HIGH, 1.4 +/- 0.4; LOW, 2.9 +/- 0.9) p53(Ser15) (HIGH, 0.9 +/- 0.4; LOW, 2.6 +/- 0.8) higher LOW immediately postexercise 3 h postexercise, respectively (P < 0.05). 3 h postexercise, mRNA content pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, mitochondrial transcription factor A, cytochrome-c oxidase IV, PGC-1alpha greater LOW compared HIGH (P < 0.05), whereas carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 showed trend toward significance (P = 0.09). However, PGC-1alpha expression increased exercise (P < 0.05), three-fold increases occurred independently CHO availability. conclude exercise-induced increase p53 phosphorylation enhanced conditions reduced CHO availability, may related upstream signaling AMPK. Given emergence p53 molecular regulator mitochondrial biogenesis, nutritional modulation contraction-induced p53 activation implications athletic clinical populations.
