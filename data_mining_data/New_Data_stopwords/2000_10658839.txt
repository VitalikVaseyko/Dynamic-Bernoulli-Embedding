 paper presents simple solution problem approximating calculated curve reaction progress measured curve usually disturbed initial oscillation auxiliary lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction. experiments leading determination apparent Km phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) Vm performed. precise estimation kinetic parameters (Km Vm) M1 isozyme pyruvate kinase (PK), measured coupling LDH reaction, sequence Michaelis-Menten pyruvate kinase second-order kinetics lactate dehydrogenase reaction well non-zero initial concentration lactate assumed. functions apparent Km Vm pyruvate kinase respect phosphate concentration, computed analysis total reaction progress curves, indicate reaction mixture contains uncompetitive inhibitor pyruvate kinase, phosphate binds inhibitor. proposed simple mathematical model pyruvate kinase Km Vm increase inorganic phosphate assumes pyridine nucleotides (NAD-derivatives) kinase inhibitors. approximate dissociation constant pyridine nucleotides-phosphate complex true Km pyruvate kinase PEP estimated. proposed model fits exactly entire measured reaction process.
