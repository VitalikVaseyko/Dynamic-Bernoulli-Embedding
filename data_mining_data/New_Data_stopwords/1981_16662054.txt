 succulent, cylindrical leaves C(4) dicot Portulaca grandiflora possess three distinct green cell types: bundle sheath cells (BSC) radial arrangement around vascular bundles; mesophyll cells (MC) outer layer adjacent BSC; water storage cells (WSC) leaf center. Unlike typical Kranz leaf anatomy, MC surround bundle sheath tissue occur area bundle sheath epidermis. Intercellular localization photosynthetic enzymes characterized using protoplasts isolated enzymatically three green cell types.Like C(4) plants, P. grandiflora ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase decarboxylating enzyme, NADP(+)-malic enzyme, BSC. Unlike C(4) plants, however, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate, Pi dikinase, NADP(+)-malate dehydrogenase C(4) pathway present three green cell types, indicating capable fixing CO(2) via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase regenerating phosphoenolpyruvate. enzymes equally distributed MC BSC similar C(4) plants. enzyme profile WSC similar MC reduced activity enzymes, except mitochondrion-associated enzymes.Intracellular localization enzymes studied organelles partitioned differential centrifugation using mechanically ruptured mesophyll bundle sheath protoplasts. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase cytosolic enzyme cells; whereas, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase NADP(+)-malic enzyme exclusively compartmentalized bundle sheath chloroplasts. NADP(+)-malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate, Pi dikinase, aspartate aminotransferase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, NADP(+)-triose-P dehydrogenase predominantly localized chloroplasts alanine aminotransferase NAD(+)-malate dehydrogenase mainly present cytosol cell types. Based enzyme localization, scheme C(4) photosynthesis P. grandiflora proposed.Well-watered plants P. grandiflora exhibit diurnal fluctuation total titratable acidity, amplitude 61 54 microequivalent per gram fresh weight leaves stems, respectively. changes parallel changes malic acid concentration tissues. severe drought conditions, diurnal changes titratable acidity malic acid concentration leaves stems much reduced. However, another C(4) dicot Amaranthus graecizans (nonsucculent) show diurnal acid fluctuation conditions. results confirm suggestion made Koch Kennedy (Plant Physiol. 65: 193-197, 1980) succulent C(4) dicots exhibit acid metabolism similar Crassulacean acid metabolism plants certain environments.
