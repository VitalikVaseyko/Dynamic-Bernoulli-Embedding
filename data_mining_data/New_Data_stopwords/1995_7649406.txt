 product c-myc proto-oncogene (c-Myc) involved control cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis. acts transcription factor recognizes CACGTG motif. sequence also found glucose-responsive elements genes involved control liver glycolysis lipogenesis. determine whether c-Myc regulate hepatic carbohydrate metabolism vivo, transgenic mice overexpress c-myc control P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene promoter generated. mice showed threefold increase c-Myc protein liver nuclei. Hepatocytes transgenic mice normal acquire fetal phenotype. However, transgenic mice showed higher levels (threefold) L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA enzyme activity control mice. increase pyruvate kinase activity led three- fivefold increase liver lactate content fivefold induction lactate production hepatocytes primary culture. expression 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase gene also increased liver transgenic mice. induction hepatic glycolysis related increase expression (about fourfold) activity (about threefold) liver glucokinase, whereas change noted hexokinase-I. change glucokinase activity led increase glucose 6-phosphate glycogen contents liver transgenic mice. expression liver-specific glucose transporter GLUT2 also increased transgenic mice, whereas change noted mRNA concentration GLUT1. Furthermore, changes liver glucose metabolism led marked reduction blood glucose (25%) insulin (40%) concentrations starvation, whereas fall 10% fed mice. Thus, liver glucose metabolism could determine blood glucose insulin set points transgenic mice. results indicated increase c-Myc protein able induce liver glucose utilization accumulation, suggested c-Myc transcription factor involved control vivo liver carbohydrate metabolism.
