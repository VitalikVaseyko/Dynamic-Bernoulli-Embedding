 Enzymes histologically normal liver hosts mammary carcinomas examined responsiveness endocrine dietary modulations. Treatments developmental stimuli alanine aminotransferase (glucocorticoids) pyruvate kinase (thyroid hormone) effect control adult rats raised levels enzymes tumor-bearing rats. latter also showed greater percentage increase malic enzyme upon thyroid hormone administration control animals. tumor-induced increase hexokinase remained unaltered various dietary treatments; enzymes subnormal levels raised (glucokinase, malic enzymes, pyruvate kinase) decreased (alanine aminotransferase ornithine aminotransferase) excessive carbohydrate intake immature adult experimental rats. normal upsurge glucokinase malic enzyme upon weaning standard solid diet (from relatively low-carbohydrate-containing milk) prevented cancerous growth organism. Similarly, standard diet, reversed within 2 days partial loss enzymes normal adult rats fasted 48 hr, restorative effect essentially complete loss glucokinase low malic enzyme activity fasted tumor bearers. results suggest failure dietary adaptations hepatic enzymes well diminutions basal levels contributes clinically observed abnormalities glucose metabolism cancer subjects.
