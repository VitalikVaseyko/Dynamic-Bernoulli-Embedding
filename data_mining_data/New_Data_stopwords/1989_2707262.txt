 Bioenergetic hemodynamic consequences cellular redox manipulations 0.2-20 mM pyruvate compared due adrenergic stress (0.7-1.1 microM norepinephrine) using isolated working guinea-pig hearts conditions normoxia, low-flow ischemia, reperfusion. 5 mM glucose (+ 5 U/l insulin) + 5 mM lactate basal energy-yielding substrates. stabilize left ventricular enddiastolic pressure, ventricular filling pressure held 12 cmH2O conditions; preload control minimized Frank-Starling effects ventricular inotropism. Global low-flow ischemia induced reducing aortic pressure levels (20-10 cmH2O) coronary autoregulatory reserve. Reactants creatine kinase, including H+ key metabolites, measured enzymatic, HPLC, polarographic techniques. normoxic hearts, norepinephrine stimulations inotropism, heart rate x pressure product, oxygen consumption (MVO2) associated fall cytosolic phosphorylation potential [( ATP]/[( ADP].[Pi]] judged creatine kinase equilibrium. contrast, infusion excess pyruvate (5 mM) markedly increased [ATP]/[( ADP].[Pi]) ventricular work output, intracellular phosphate decreased; MVO2 remained constant conditions. reperfusion following ischemia, pyruvate effected striking concentration-dependent increases MVO2, phosphorylation potential, inotropism. Pyruvate dehydrogenase flux augmented reperfusion hyperemia followed near-complete recoveries [ATP]/([ADP].[Pi]), contractile force, heart rate x pressure product, MVO2 presence 5-10 mM pyruvate. Pyruvate also attenuated ischemic adenylate degradation. Omission glucose perfusion medium rendered pyruvate ineffective postischemic hearts. Similarly, excess lactate (5-15 mM) acetate (5 mM) failed reenergize reperfused hearts severe depressions MVO2 inotropism developed despite presence glucose. Apparently, subcellular redox manipulations pyruvate dissociated stimulated mitochondrial respiration increased inotropism low cytosolic phosphorylation potentials. evidence extramitochondrial [ADP].[Pi]/[ATP] ratio primary factor control mitochondrial respiration. mechanism pyruvate enhancement inotropism normoxia reperfusion probably multifactorial. Thermodynamic effects subcellular [NADH]/[NAD+] ratios coupled rise cytosolic [ATP]/[( ADP].[Pi]) ratio constant (normoxia) increased (reperfusion) MVO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
