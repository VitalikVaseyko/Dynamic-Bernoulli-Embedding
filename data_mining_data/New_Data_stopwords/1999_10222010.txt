 Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) prokaryotic enzyme catalyzes phosphorolysis polynucleotides release NDPs. also believed play key role turnover prokaryotic transcripts, thus regulating gene expression. moment, radioisotopic methods available assaying PNPase crude extracts; involve incubating [32P]phosphate poly(A) presence enzyme, separating [32P]phosphate [32P]ADP, quantifying ADP scintillation counting. Photometric assay using pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase auxiliary enzymes feasible crude extracts endogenous ATPase activities, regenerate ADP ATP released pyruvate kinase. Here, present simple photometric assay uses cyclic detection system which, due sequential action pyruvate kinase hexokinase, results exponential increase ADP glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate revealed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction. Based theoretical model, linear increase absorbance predicted function square reaction time, slope proportional PNPase activity. Experimental data confirmed theoretical predictions showed assay quantitative unquestionably specific. also devised simple procedure determining absolute enzyme activities (expressed micromoles product formed per minute) using exact amounts pure PNPase internal standards.
