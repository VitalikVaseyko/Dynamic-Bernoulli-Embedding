 determined annual change intermediary metabolism glucose variations specific activity fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), alanine aminotransferase (AAT) pyruvate kinase (PK). Fish (average mass 330 g) kept cages natural conditions temperature photoperiod fed commercial diet. FBPase, AAT PK increased activity June different ways: AAT PK increased V(max), FBPase increased velocity subsaturating substrate concentrations, changing K(m). reproduction period modified annual tendency changes enzyme activities parameters, K(m) V(max), except K(m) PK shows circa-annual rhythm. relation changes enzymes activity photoperiod temperature found study, except K(m) AAT presents positive correlation photoperiod negative correlation temperature.
