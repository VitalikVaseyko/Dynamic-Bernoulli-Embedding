 five glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase pyruvate kinase purified extracts Zymomonas mobilis cells, using dye-ligand chromatography principal step. Two procedures, producing three two enzymes respectively, described detail. Z. mobilis glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase found similar respects enzyme sources, except slightly larger subunit size. Phosphoglycerate kinase properties typical enzyme; however, show sulphate activation effects characteristic enzyme sources. Phosphoglycerate mutase dimer, partially independent 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, high specific activity. Enolase found octameric; otherwise properties similar yeast enzyme. Pyruvate kinase unusual dimeric, requiring K+ activity. allosterically activated sugar phosphates, high activity absence effectors. quantitative differences relative amounts enzymes, compared eukaryotic species, ascribed fact Z. mobilis utilizes Entner-Doudoroff pathway rather common Embden-Meyerhoff glycolytic route.
