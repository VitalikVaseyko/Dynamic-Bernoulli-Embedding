 Warburg effect describes heightened propensity tumor cells produce lactic acid presence absence O(2) . generally held notion Warburg effect related energy. Using whole-genome, proteomic MALDI-TOF-MS metabolite analysis, investigated Warburg effect malignant neuroblastoma N2a cells. findings show Warburg effect serves functional role regulating acidic pericellular pH (pHe), mediated metabolic inversion fluctuating dominance glycolytic-rate substrate level phosphorylation (SLP) mitochondrial (mt) oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) control lactic acid production. results also show alkaline pHe caused elevation SLP/OXPHOS ratio (approximately 98% SLP/OXPHOS); ratio approximately 56% neutral pHe approximately 93% acidic pHe. Acidic pHe paralleled greater expression mitochondrial biogenesis OXPHOS genes, complex III-V (Uqcr10, Atp5 Cox7c), mt Fmc1, Romo1, Tmem 173, Tomm6, aldehyde dehydrogenase, mt Sod2 mt biogenesis component PPAR-gamma co-activator 1 adjunct loss mt fission (Mff). Moreover, acidic pHe corresponded metabolic efficiency evidenced rise mTOR nutrient sensor GbetaL, downstream target (Eif4ebp1), insulin modulators (Trib3 Fetub) loss catabolic (Hadhb, Bdh1 Pygl)/glycolytic processes (aldolase C, pyruvate kinase, Nampt aldose-reductase). contrast, alkaline pHe initiated loss mitofusin 2, complex II-IV (Sdhaf1, Uqcrq, Cox4i2 Aldh1l2), aconitase, mitochondrial carrier triple repeat 1 mt biosynthetic (Coq2, Coq5 Coq9). conclusion, Warburg effect might serve negative feedback loop regulates pHe toward broad acidic range altering lactic acid production inversion metabolic systems. effects independent changes O(2) concentration glucose supply.
