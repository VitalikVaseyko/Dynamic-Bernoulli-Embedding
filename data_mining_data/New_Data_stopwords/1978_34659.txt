 antivibrionic activity crystalline preparations five enzymes glycolytic cycle animals cells investigated. Phosphorylase "a" (0.5 mg/ml), aldolase (15 mg/ml) pyruvate kinase (0.1 mg/ml) found inhibit proliferation Vibrio cholerae cells; phosphoglucomutase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase concentration 0.25 mg/ml found vibriocidal. mixture enzymes containing 0.062 mg/ml phosphorylase "a" 0.125 mg/ml phosphoglucomutase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase showed vibriocidal activity.
