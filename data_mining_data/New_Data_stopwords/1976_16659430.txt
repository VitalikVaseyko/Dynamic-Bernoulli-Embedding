 dark respiration rate discs fully expanded tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum) increased linearly decreasing diameter, relative increase independent leaf age. wound respiration responsible situation reached plateau within 15 minutes excision. Metabolite analysis gave evidence two independent effects, also unrelated age. first forward crossover phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate found early 1 minute excision persisted 40 minutes. attributed activation pyruvate kinase changed ionic balance resulting membrane damage, accompanied reverse crossover triose phosphates 3-phosphoglycerate, localized outer region discs. second effect rapid rise hexose monophosphate ATP levels throughout discs. 1 10 minutes ATP/ADP ratio rose strongly least 3 hours; 20 40 minutes net synthesis adenine nucleotide ATP. results indicate extrapolation leaf discs intact leaves highly inadvisable.
