 AIM: study effect artemether (Art) glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), pyruvate kinase (PK) japanicum. METHODS: Mice infected schistosome cercariae 32-38 treated ig Art 100-300 mg.kg-1 killed 24-72 h medication collection schistosomes. activities GAPDH, PGK, PK worms determined measuring formation NADH consumption NAD. lactate content worms also measured. RESULTS: infected mice treated ig Art 300 mg.kg-1 24 h, inhibition rates GAPDH 13% (Male) 21% (Female), 48 h later inhibition rates enzyme 6% (Male) 28% (Female). Art 300 mg.kg-1 given infected mice 24 h 48 h, inhibition rates PGK 60% (Male) 48% (Female) well 75% (Male) 62% (Female), respectively. Similar results seen PK activity. 72 h treatment reduction rate lactate content Female worm 72%, Male 48%. CONCLUSION: glycolytic pathway Male Female schistosomes, PGK PK activities inhibited Art. GAPDH activity Female worms also susceptible Art, Male worms showed temporary inhibition treatment Art. Art reduced lactate content Female Male worms.
