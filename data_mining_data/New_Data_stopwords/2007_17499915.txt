 cancer chemotherapeutic drug, arsenic acts numerous intracellular signal transduction pathways cancer cells. However, mechanism actions still fully understood. Previous studies suggest arsenic reacts closely spaced cysteine (Cys) residues proteins high Cys content accessible sulfhydryl (SH) groups. study, human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 examined cellular model explore arsenic-binding proteins mechanism binding. arsenic-biotin conjugate synthesized coupling pentafluorophenol ester biotin p-aminophenylarsenoxide. Arsenic-binding proteins eluted streptavidin resin arsenic-biotin treated MCF-7 cells, separated polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identified matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Arsenic-binding properties two proteins, beta-tubulin pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), studied vitro biological consequences binding evaluated. Binding assay Western blotting confirmed binding beta-tubulin PKM2 arsenic concentration-dependent manner. Arsenic binding inhibited tubulin polymerization, surprisingly effect PKM2 activity. Molecular modeling showed binding Cys(12) alone vicinal Cys residues (Cys(12) Cys(213)) beta-tubulin arsenic blocked active site access GTP, necessary tubulin polymerization. contrary, Cys residues PKM2 far away active site enzyme. summary, study confirmed beta-tubulin PKM2 arsenic-binding proteins MCF-7 cells. Functional consequence binding may depend whether arsenic binding causes conformational changes blocks active sites target proteins.
