 toxic effect ammonia rCHO-GS cell decreased obviously due transfection GS system serum-free culture. maximum cell density, 15.6 x 10(5) cells/mL obtained culture 1.42 mmol/L ammonia. growth rCHO-GS cell inhibited increased ammonia concentration. However, cell density 8.9 x 10(5) cells/mL obtained concentration ammonia 12.65mmol/L. intracellar metabolic pathways affected due decrease toxic effect ammonia rCHO-GS cell. increase initial ammonia concentration 0.36mmol/L 12.65mmol/L, yield coefficients cell glucose lactate glucose decreased. activities hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased 43%, 140% 25%, respectively, indicating utilization glucose increased glycolysis pathway prone efficient energy metabolism pathway. increased activity glutamate-pyruvate aminotransferase (GPT) showed conversation glutamate alpha-ketoglutarate shifted glutamate-pyruvate transamination pathway. deamination pathway inhibited due decreased activity glutamate dehydrogenase. addition, number cells G0/G1 phase increased specific production rate recombinant protein increased 2.1-fold increase initial ammonia concentration 0.36mmol/L 12.65mmol/L.
