 development cancer-specific therapeutics limited healthy cells cancer cells depend common pathways. Pyruvate kinase (PK) exists M1 (PKM1) M2 (PKM2) isoforms. PKM2, whose expression cancer cells results aerobic glycolysis suggested bestow selective growth advantage, promising target. many oncogenes impart common alteration cell metabolism, inhibition M2 isoform might broad applicability. show several small interfering (si) RNAs designed target mismatches M2 M1 isoforms confer specific knockdown former, resulting decreased viability increased apoptosis multiple cancer cell lines less normal fibroblasts endothelial cells. vivo delivery siPKM2 additionally causes substantial tumor regression established xenografts. results suggest inherent nucleotide-level specificity siRNA harnessed develop therapeutics target isoform-specific exons genes exhibiting differential splicing patterns various cell types.
