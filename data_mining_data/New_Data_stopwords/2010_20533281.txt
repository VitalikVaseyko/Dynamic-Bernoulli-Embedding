 "Warburg effect," also termed aerobic glycolysis, describes increased reliance cancer cells glycolysis ATP production, even presence oxygen. Consequently, continued interest inhibitors glycolysis cancer therapeutics. One example dichloroacetate (DCA), pyruvate mimetic stimulates oxidative phosphorylation inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. study, mechanistic basis DCA anti-cancer activity re-evaluated vitro using biochemical, cellular proteomic approaches. Results demonstrated DCA relatively inactive (IC(50) >/= 17 mM, 48 hr), induces apoptosis high concentrations (>/= 25 mM, 48 hr) cancer cell selective. Subsequent 2D-PAGE proteomic analysis confirmed DCA-induced growth suppression without apoptosis induction. Furthermore, DCA depolarizes mitochondria promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation cell types. However, DCA found selective activity rho(0) cells [mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deficient] synergize 2-deoxyglucose complex IV deficient HCT116 p53(-/-) cells. DCA also synergized vitro cisplatin topotecan, two antineoplastic agents known damage mitochondrial DNA. data suggest cells "hardwired" selectively utilize glycolysis ATP generation (e.g., mtDNA mutations), ability DCA force oxidative phosphorylation confers selective toxicity. conclusion, although provide mechanism distinct reported previously, ability DCA target cell lines defects electron transport chain synergize existing chemotherapeutics supports preclinical development.
