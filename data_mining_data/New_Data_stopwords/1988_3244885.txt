 White muscle pyruvate kinase sea bass presents positive cooperativity respect PEP substrate. enzyme regulated F-1.6-P2 L-Phenylalanine. activator effect F-1.6-P2 experiments carried substrate PEP crude extract seems indicate enzyme activated vivo compound. enzyme inhibited either alanine ATP inhibited L-phenylalanine. Therefore enzyme presents kinetic regulatory properties similar mammalian isozyme M2.
