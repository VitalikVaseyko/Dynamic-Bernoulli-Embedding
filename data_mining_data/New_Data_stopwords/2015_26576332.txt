 Acquired de novo resistance selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen fulvestrant (ICI) major barrier successful treatment breast cancer. Gene expression patterns tamoxifen resistant (TamR-MCF-7) cells compared parental cells (MCF-7L) identify aberrantly regulated metabolic pathway. TamR-MCF-7 cells cross resistant ICI doxorubicin, increased mitochondrial DNA. small subset genes altered expression TamR-MCF-7 relative MCF-7L cells. One genes, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4), phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDK4 expression elevated TamR-MCF-7 cells; result also observed second model acquired antiestrogen resistance. PDK4 expression controlled part glucocorticoid response elements PDK4 gene promoter. MCF-7L cells, PDK4 mRNA expression insensitive glucocorticoid receptor agonists, dexamethasone dramatically increased PDK4 expression TamR-MCF-7 cells. Using siRNA knock PDK4 expression increased TamR-MCF-7 sensitivity ICI; contrast adapting cells growth glucose depleted media affect ICI sensitivity. Despite TamR-MCF-7 cells high levels PDK4 mRNA relative MCF-7L, TamR-MCF-7 cells increased PDH activity. Wild type MCF-7 cells reported heterozygous G mutation results substitution threonine alanine near PDK4's catalytic site. found loss heterozygosity TamR-MCF-7 cells; TamR-MCF-7 homozygous wild type allele. data support role altered regulation PDH PDK4 altered substrate utilization development drug resistance human breast cancer cells.
