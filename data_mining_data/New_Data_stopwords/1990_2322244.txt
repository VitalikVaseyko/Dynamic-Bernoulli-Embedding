 human cytosolic thyroid hormone binding protein (p58) recently shown monomer pyruvate kinase, subtype PKM2, intrinsic pyruvate kinase activity. present study evaluated effect L-alpha-alanine binding 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) enzymatic activity p58. Analysis competitive binding data indicated alanine, physiological concentration, non-competitive inhibitor T3 binding p58. Furthermore, alanine found "mixed" inhibitor substrate phosphoenol pyruvate. However, binding alanine p58 block association p58 form tetrameric pyruvate kinase.
