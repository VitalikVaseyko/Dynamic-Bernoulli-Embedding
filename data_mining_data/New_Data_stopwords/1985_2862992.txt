 Clonal subpopulations chemically induced tumorigenic rat liver epithelial cell line analyzed cellular, biochemical, vitro growth properties tumorigenicity injection day-old newborn isogeneic rats. phenotypic properties studied included DNA content; growth rate culture; activities gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, NADH diaphorase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase; ability grow calcium-poor medium; ability form colonies soft agar. results show none phenotypes cosegregates tumorigenicity therefore reliable "marker" phenotype neoplastic transformation cultured rat liver epithelial cells. poor correlations, either qualitatively quantitatively, paratumorigenic phenotypes tumorigenicity suggest neoplastic transformation cells involves specific transforming gene locus loci vitro paratumorigenic phenotypes merely epiphenomena neoplastic transformation progression. study reveals efficiency tumorigenicity assay cultured rat liver epithelial cells isogeneic newborn rats considerably improved incubating cells medium containing trace amounts serum prior transplantation host animals.
