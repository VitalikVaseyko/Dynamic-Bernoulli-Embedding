 novel frameshift mutation attributable 14-nucleotide insertion hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) encoding truncated HNF-1alpha (G554fsX556) 76-amino acid deletion carboxyl terminus identified Thai family maturity-onset diabetes young (MODY). wild-type mutant HNF-1alpha proteins expressed vitro transcription translation (TNT) assay transfection HeLa cells. wild-type mutant HNF-1alpha could similarly bind human glucose-transporter 2 (GLUT2) promoter examined electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). However, transactivation activities mutant HNF-1alpha human GLUT2 rat L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promoters HeLa cells determined luciferase reporter assay reduced approximately 55-60% wild-type protein. results suggested functional defect novel truncated HNF-1alpha (G554fsX556) transactivation target-gene promoters would account beta-cell dysfunction associated pathogenesis MODY.
