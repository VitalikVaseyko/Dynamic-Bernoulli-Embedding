 effect different cooling temperatures durations resistance freezing frozen storage -20 degrees C Lactobacillus acidophilus RD758 studied, using central composite rotatable design. cold adaptation observed cells maintained moderate temperature (26 degrees C) long time (8h) cooled final temperature 15 degrees C. conditions led low rate loss acidification activity frozen storage (0.64 minday(-1)) high residual acidification activity 180 days frozen storage (1011 min). experimental design allowed us determine optimal cooling conditions, established 28 degrees C 8h. Adaptation cold temperatures related increase unsaturated saturated fatty acid ratio relative cycC19:0 fatty acid concentration. Moreover, increased synthesis four specific proteins observed adaptive response optimal cooling conditions. included stress protein ATP-dependent ClpP two cold induced proteins: pyruvate kinase putative glycoprotein endopeptidase.
