 Exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) characterized molecular mechanisms responsible initiation choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Inflammatory processes associated upregulation canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway exudative AMD. focus review link WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation neovascular progression exudative AMD activation aerobic glycolysis production angiogenic factors. Increased WNT/beta-catenin pathway involves hexokinase 2 (HK2) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). WNT/beta-catenin pathway stimulates PI3K/Akt pathway HIF-1alpha activates glycolytic enzymes: glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A), monocarboxylate lactate transporter (MCT-1). phenomenon called aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect. Consequently, phosphorylation PDK-1 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Thus, large part pyruvate cannot converted acetyl-CoA mitochondria part acetyl-CoA enter tricarboxylic acid cycle. Cytosolic pyruvate converted lactate action LDH-A. exudative AMD, high level cytosolic lactate correlated increase VEGF expression, angiogenic factor CNV. Photoreceptors retina cells metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis protect oxidative damage, cancer cells do.
