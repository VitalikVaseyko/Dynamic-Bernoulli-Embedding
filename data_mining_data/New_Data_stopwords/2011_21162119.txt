 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) lipid status responsive gene involved muscle fuel selection. Evidence mounting support therapeutic potential PDK4 inhibitors treat diabetes. Factors regulate PDK4 mRNA expression include plasma corticosterone, insulin free fatty acids. objective determine impact plasma factors PDK4 mRNA develop validate population mathematical model differentiate aging, diet disease effects muscle PDK4 expression. Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, polygenic non-obese model type 2 diabetes, used diabetic animal model. Muscle PDK4 mRNA expression examined real-time QRTPCR. Groups GK rats along controls fed either normal high fat diet killed 4, 8, 12, 16 20 weeks age. Plasma corticosterone, insulin free fatty acids measured. proposed mechanism-based model successfully described age, disease diet effects relative contribution plasma regulators PDK4 mRNA expression. Muscle growth reduced PDK4 mRNA production rate 14% per gram increase. high fat diet increased initial production rate constant GK rats 2.19-fold. model indicated corticosterone moderate effect PDK4 sensitive free fatty acid insulin fluxes, good agreement literature data.
