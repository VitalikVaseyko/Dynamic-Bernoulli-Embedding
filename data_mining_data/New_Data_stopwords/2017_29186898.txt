 Fibrosis characterized fibroblast proliferation fibroblast differentiation myofibroblasts, generate relaxation-free contraction mechanism associated excessive collagen synthesis extracellular matrix, promotes irreversible tissue retraction evolving towards fibrosis. thermodynamic point view, mechanisms leading fibrosis irreversible processes occur changing entropy production rate. thermodynamic behaviors metabolic enzymes involved fibrosis modified dysregulation transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway, leading aerobic glycolysis, called Warburg effect. Molecular signaling pathways leading fibrosis considered dissipative structures exchange energy matter environment far thermodynamic equilibrium. myofibroblastic cells arise exergonic processes switching core metabolism oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, generates energy reprograms cellular energy metabolism induce process myofibroblast differentiation. Circadian rhythms far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic processes. directly participate regulating TGF-beta WNT/beta-catenin pathways involved energetic dysregulation enabling fibrosis. present review focusses thermodynamic implications reprogramming cellular energy metabolism, leading fibroblast differentiation myofibroblasts positive interplay TGF-beta WNT/beta-catenin pathways underlying fibrosis.
