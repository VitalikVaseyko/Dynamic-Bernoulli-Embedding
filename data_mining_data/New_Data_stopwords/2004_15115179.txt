 previously suggested phosphorylation proteins mitochondrial kinases regulate activity NADH/CoQ oxidoreductase. Initial data showed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylate mitochondrial membrane proteins. Upon phosphorylation crude PDK, mitochondria appeared deficient NADH/cytochrome c reductase activity associated increased superoxide production. Conversely, phosphorylation PKA resulted increased NADH/cytochrome c reductase activity decreased superoxide formation. Current data confirms PKA involvement regulating Complex activity phosphorylation 18 kDa subunit. Beef heart NADH/ cytochrome c reductase activity increases 150% control upon incubation PKA ATP-gamma-S. cloned four human isoforms PDK purified beef heart Complex I. Incubation mitochondria PDK isoforms ATP alter Complex activity superoxide production. Radiolabeling mitochondria purified Complex PDK failed reveal phosphorylated proteins.
