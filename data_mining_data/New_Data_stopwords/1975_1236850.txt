 Co2+, activates rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, competes Mn2+ active site enzyme KD 46 muM. Co2+ binds phosphoenolpyruvate KD 4.1 mM. structures binary Co2+/P-enolpyruvate, quaternary pyruvate kinase/Co2+/K+/P-enolpyruvate complexes studied using EPR effects Co2+ longitudinal (T1) transverse (T2) relaxation times protons water P-enolpyruvate phosphorus P-enolpyruvate. EPR spectra complexes 6 K, disappear 40 K reveal principal g values 2 7 indicating high spin Co2+. free Co2+ binary Co2+/P-enolpyruvate complex, T1 water protons independent frequency range 8, 15, 24.3, 100, 220 MHz. Assuming coordination numbers (q) 6 5 free Co2+ Co2+/P-enolpyruvate, respectively, correlation times (tauc) 1.3 times 10(-13) 1.7 times 10(-13) s, calculated. distances Co2+ phosphorus cis trans protons binary Co2+/P-enolpyruvate complex calculated T1 values 2.7 A, 4.1 A, 5.3 A, respectively, indicating inner sphere phosphoryl complex. Consistent direct phosphoryl coordination, large Co2+ phosphorus hyperfine contact coupling constant (A/h) 5 times 10(5) Hz determined frequency dependence T2 phosphorus 25.1, 40.5, 101.5 MHz. enzyme complexes, dipolar correlation time tauc 2 times 10(-12) number rapidly exchanging water ligands (q) 0.6 determined frequency dependence T1 water protons. quaternary enzyme/Co2+/K+/P-enolyruvate complex tauc value consistent frequency dependence T1 phosphorus enzyme-bound P-enolpyruvate 25.1 40.5 MHz. Distances enzyme-bound C02+ phosphorus protons P-enolpyruvate, T1 values, 5.0 8 10 A, respectively, indicating predominantly (greater equal 98%) second spere complex less 2% inner sphere complex. Consistent second sphere complex enzyme, A/h value less 10(3) Hz determined frequency dependence T2 phosphorus. complexes exchange reates found faster paramagnetic relaxation rates hyperfine contact interaction found small compared dipolar interaction. results thus indicate interaction C02+ P-enolpyruvate greatly decreased upon binding active site pyruvate kinase.
