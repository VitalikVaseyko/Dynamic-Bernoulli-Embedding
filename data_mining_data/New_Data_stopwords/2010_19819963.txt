 Resveratrol natural polyphenolic compound activates nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Resveratrol recently shown exert potent antidiabetic actions orally delivered animal models type 2 diabetes. However, tissue(s) mediating beneficial effects unknown. SIRT1 expressed central nervous system (CNS) neurons known control glucose insulin homeostasis, hypothesized resveratrol antidiabetic effects mediated brain. Here, report long-term intracerebroventricular infusion resveratrol normalizes hyperglycemia greatly improves hyperinsulinemia diet-induced obese diabetic mice. noteworthy effects independent changes body weight, food intake, circulating leptin levels. addition, CNS resveratrol delivery improves hypothalamic nuclear factor-kappaB inflammatory signaling reducing acetylated-RelA/p65 total RelA/p65 protein contents, inhibitor nuclear factor-kappaB alpha IkappaB kinase beta mRNA levels. Furthermore, treatment leads reduced hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 mRNA protein levels ameliorates pyruvate-induced hyperglycemia mouse model type 2 diabetes. Collectively, results unveiled previously unrecognized key role CNS mediating antidiabetic actions resveratrol.
