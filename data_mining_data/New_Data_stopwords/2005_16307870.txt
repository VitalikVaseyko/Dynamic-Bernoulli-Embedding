 Despite detailed understanding metabolism, mitochondria often behave anomalously. particular, global suppression mitochondrial metabolism metabolite exchange occurs apoptosis, ischemia anoxia, cytopathic hypoxia sepsis multiple organ failure, alcoholic liver disease, aerobic glycolysis cancer cells (Warburg effect) unstimulated pancreatic beta cells. Here, propose closure voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) mitochondrial outer membrane accounts global mitochondrial suppression. anoxia, cytopathic hypoxia ethanol treatment, reactive oxygen nitrogen species, cytokines, kinase cascades increased NADH act inhibit VDAC conductance promote selective oxidation membrane-permeable respiratory substrates like short chain fatty acids acetaldehyde. cancer cells, highly expressed hexokinase binds inhibits VDAC suppress mitochondrial function stimulating glycolysis, escape mechanism intervenes glucose-6-phosphate accumulates dissociates hexokinase VDAC. Similarly, glucokinase binds mitochondria insulin-secreting beta cells, possibly blocking VDAC suppressing mitochondrial function. propose glucose metabolism leads glucose-6-phosphate-dependent unbinding glucokinase, relief VDAC inhibition, release ATP mitochondria ATP-dependent insulin release. support overall proposal, ethanol treatment isolated rat hepatocytes inhibited mitochondrial respiration accessibility adenylate kinase intermembrane space, effects overcome digitonin permeabilization outer membrane. Overall, considerations suggest VDAC dynamic regulator, governator, global mitochondrial function health disease.
