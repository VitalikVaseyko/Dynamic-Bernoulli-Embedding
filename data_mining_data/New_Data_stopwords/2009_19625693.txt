 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) regulates oxidative carbohydrate disposal skeletal muscle downregulated reversible phosphorylation catalyzed PDH kinase (PDK). Previous work demonstrated increased PDK activity PDK4 expression human skeletal muscle following high-fat low-carbohydrate (HF) diet, leads decreased PDH active form (PDHa activity) carbohydrate oxidation. purpose study examine time course changes PDK PDHa activities refeeding carbohydrates HF diet human skeletal muscle. Healthy male volunteers (n = 8) consumed standardized 3-day Pre-diet energy content habitual diet, followed eucaloric 6-day HF diet (Pre-diet: 50:30:20%; HF diet: 5:75:20%; carbohydrate/fat/protein). Muscle biopsies taken HF diet 45 min 3 h carbohydrate refeeding single high-glycemic index carbohydrate meal (88:5:7% carbohydrate/fat/protein) representing approximately one third individual subject's habitual energy intake. PDK activity increased 0.08 +/- 0.01 Pre- 0.25 +/- 0.02 min (P < 0.001) Post-HF diet, decreased carbohydrate refeeding 0.17 +/- 0.05 (P = 0.014) 0.11 +/- 0.01 min (P = 0.006) 45 min 3 h, respectively. PDHa decreased 0.89 +/- 0.20 0.32 +/- 0.05 (P = 0.007) mmol x min(-1) x kg wet wt(-1) following HF diet, increased transiently refeeding 45 min, returned lower values 3 h (P = 0.025 compared Pre). potential mechanism(s) attenuation PDHa activity remains unclear. data demonstrate human skeletal muscle, adaptive increase PDK activity following HF diet rapidly reversed Pre-diet activity levels within 45 min 3 h, accompanied short-term increase PDHa activity.
