 respiration rate, aerobic glycolysis glycolytic enzyme activities purified mouse peritoneal macrophages increase phagocytosis either free antibody-coated SRBC. changes, however, seem roughly parallel amount phagocytized antigen. digestive phase, Ag-Ab complexes induce marked changes macrophage metabolism comparable amount free antigen. Lactate production, activity several glycolytic enzymes alanine-aminotransferase well glycogen content greatly affected. Since cell transfer experiments macrophage-associated SRBC prime normal recipients antibody response, whereas cell-associated SRBC-antibody complexes cannot, concluded changed macrophage metabolism drives antibody-coated antigen metabolic channels allowing rapid total degradation.
