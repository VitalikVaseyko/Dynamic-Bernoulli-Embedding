 Cancer recognized disease arising genetic metabolic abnormalities. mid-1900s, Otto Warburg described phenomenon elevated glucose consumption aerobic glycolysis, dependence cancer cells phenomenon proliferation growth. Warburg effect formed basis diagnostic prognostic imaging modalities positron emission tomography (PET); however, yet capitalized phenomenon therapy. Several mechanisms shown contribute Warburg effect.Ongoing studies attempting understand reasons tumor cells engage aerobic glycolysis lieu oxidative phosphorylation, advantages accrue result. review, discuss known benefits tumor cells metabolic switch, highlight key enzymes play role aerobic glycolysis. also describe novel therapeutic options targeting glucose metabolism importance continuing understand metabolic plasticity cancer.
