 contrast submandibular gland, developing rat parotid gland shows refractoriness cholinergic secretagogues 2 wks age. assess underlining mechanism refractoriness, investigated changes oxygen consumption function animal age slices rat submandibular parotid glands, measuring basal carbachol-stimulated levels. oxygen consumption determined direct manometric method Warburg apparatus. Carbachol-induced oxygen uptake submandibular gland slices observed 1 day age reached adult level stimulation 3 wks age. parotid gland, carbachol failed stimulate oxygen uptake early post-natal period, first response detected 2 wks age, reaching adult level 4 wks age. Para-fluorohexahydro-sila-diphenidol (pFHHSiD), selective M3 antagonist, inhibited carbachol-induced oxygen uptake glands, pirenzepine, selective M1 antagonist, effect, suggesting M3 muscarinic receptors involved process. respiratory effect carbachol, glands, inhibitable ouabain and, lesser extent, furosemide, indicating carbachol-enhanced oxygen uptake due Na,K-ATPase furosemide-sensitive co-transport Na+ entry underdeveloped immature cells. ouabain-sensitive Na,K-ATPase activity parotid gland increased birth 28 days age. time parotid gland refractoriness carbachol, Ca2+ ionophore A23187 caused increase oxygen uptake presence extracellular Ca2+. presence carbachol, effect ionophore significantly higher ionophore alone. results raise possibility refractoriness parotid gland carbachol due inability carbachol increase Ca2+ uptake rather lack distal limb, resides pathway receptor stimulation Na,K-ATPase activation.
