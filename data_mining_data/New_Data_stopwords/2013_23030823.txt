 Mutations leading inappropriate activation Akt isoforms contribute proliferation survival significant proportion human cancers. Akt activated phosphorylation T-loop residue (Thr(308)) PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Ser(473)) mTORC2 [mTOR (mammalian target rapamycin) complex 2]. Potent PDK1 inhibitors GSK2334470 recently elaborated potential anti-cancer agents. However, compounds surprisingly ineffective suppressing Akt activation. present study demonstrate resistance PDK1 inhibitors results Akt efficiently recruited PDK1 via two alternative mechanisms. first involves ability Akt PDK1 mutually interact PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) second messenger PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. second entails recruitment PDK1 Akt phosphorylation Ser(473) mTORC2, via substrate-docking motif termed PIF-pocket. find disruption either PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Ser(473) phosphorylation/PIF-pocket mechanism moderately impacts Akt activation, induces marked sensitization PDK1 inhibitors. findings suggest suppression Ser(473) phosphorylation using mTOR inhibitors would disrupt PIF-pocket mechanism thereby sensitize Akt PDK1 inhibitors. Consistent this, find combing PDK1 mTOR inhibitors reduced Akt activation basal levels markedly inhibited proliferation cell lines tested. results suggest work warranted explore utility combining PDK1 mTOR inhibitors therapeutic strategy treatment cancers harbour mutations elevating Akt activity.
