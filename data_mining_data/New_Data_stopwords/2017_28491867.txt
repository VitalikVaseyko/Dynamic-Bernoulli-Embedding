 Many cancers long thought primarily metabolize glucose energy production-a phenomenon known Warburg Effect, classic studies Otto Warburg early twentieth century. Yet cancer cells also utilize substrates, amino acids fatty acids, produce raw materials cellular maintenance energetic currency accomplish cellular tasks. contribution substrates increasingly appreciated context glioma, common form malignant brain tumor. Multiple catabolic pathways used energy production within glioma cells, linked many ways anabolic pathways supporting cellular function. example: glycolysis supports energy production provides carbon skeletons synthesis nucleic acids; meanwhile fatty acids used energetic substrates raw materials lipid membranes. Furthermore, bio-energetic pathways connected pro-oncogenic signaling within glioma cells. example: AMPK signaling links catabolism cell cycle progression; mTOR signaling contributes metabolic flexibility cancer cell survival; electron transport chain produces ATP reactive oxygen species (ROS) act signaling molecules; Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs) mediate interactions cells vasculature within tumor environment. Mutations tumor suppressor p53, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 2 implicated oncogenic signaling well establishing metabolic phenotypes genetically-defined subsets malignant glioma. pathways critically contribute tumor biology. aim review two-fold. Firstly, present current state knowledge regarding metabolic strategies employed malignant glioma cells, including aerobic glycolysis; pentose phosphate pathway; one-carbon metabolism; tricarboxylic acid cycle, central amino acid metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation; fatty acid metabolism, significantly contributes energy production glioma cells. Secondly, highlight processes (including Randle Effect, AMPK signaling, mTOR activation, etc.) understood link bio-energetic pathways oncogenic signals, thereby allowing glioma cell achieve pro-malignant state.
