 proposed comprehensive model glycolytic reaction mechanism shown possibility self-tuning resonance, consequent increase efficiency energy transduction separating model two subsystems: one phosphofructokinase (PFKase; ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) reaction pyruvate kinase (PKase; ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) reaction. purpose article present alternative theoretical approach-one directly applicable experimental situations-for detection effects without need decomposition. approach consists studying response systems externally applied periodic perturbations inside fundamental entrainment band computation. show, agreement previous results obtained simpler reaction schemes, large increases decreases dissipation may occur narrow range period entrainment entire mechanism. period autonomous glycolytic oscillation past marginal stability approaches value, T(0) (lim), close period relaxation oscillation PKase subsystem, T(PKase), tuning primary oscillophor, PFKase system, effected PKase system; cases predict, larger values amplitude perturbation, two peaks response spectrum: one near period autonomous oscillation period PKase system. small amplitudes perturbation, one resonance peak near period autonomous oscillation. T(0) (lim) close T(PKase), one resonance peak small large amplitudes external perturbations. computer results lead classification chemical species reaction mechanism two categories. first category following two properties. (i) fundamental entrainment occurs, amplitude response species reaction mechanism largest oscillation perturbation chemical species phase oscillation variable mechanism. (ii) amplitude external periodic perturbation monitored time keep variable mechanism always constant, oscillatory response whole reaction pathway. variables two properties found essential generation self-sustained oscillations model. second category neither two properties holds.
