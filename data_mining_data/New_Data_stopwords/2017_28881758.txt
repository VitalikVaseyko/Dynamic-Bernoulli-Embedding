 Despite impressive initial clinical responses, majority lung cancer patients treated paclitaxel eventually develop resistance drug. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 (PDK2) key regulator glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation, expression increased variety tumors. study, role PDK2 mediating paclitaxel resistance lung cancer cells investigated using biochemical isotopic tracing methods. Increased expression PDK2 observed paclitaxel-resistant cells ascompared totheir parental cells. Down-regulation PDK2 usingsiRNA increased sensitivity paclitaxel resistant lung cancer cells. Targeting paclitaxel-resistant cells throughPDK2 knockdown associated reduced glycolysis rather increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Moreover, combining paclitaxel withthe specific PDK2 inhibitor dichloroacetate synergistic inhibitory effect viability paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells. results indicate paclitaxel-induced expression PDK2 serves important mechanism acquired paclitaxel resistance lung cancer cells. also highlight importance PDK2 potential therapeutic interventions patients developed resistance paclitaxel.
