 BACKGROUND: Decreased apoptosis pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) plays key role pulmonary vascular remodeling pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, cause mechanism decrease apoptosis still unclear. Serotonin (5-HT) shown involved PH inducing PASMC proliferation activation 5-HT1B receptors (5-HT1BR) 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). 5-HT1BR 5-HTT also involved abnormal apoptosis many pathological processes. Therefore, hypothesized 5-HT induces decreases PASMC apoptosis 5-HT1BR 5-HTT. METHODS: PASMCs treated 5-HT, proliferation apoptosis assayed. 5-HT1BR agonists, 5-HT1BR antagonist, 5-HTT antagonist, combined 5-HT1BR/5-HTT antagonists, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation inhibitor peptide (EPI) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) used explore mechanism 5-HT induce decrease PASMC apoptosis. RESULTS: PASMCs stimulated 5-HT showed increase proliferation decrease apoptosis, accompanied increase pERK1/2, PDK, mitochondrial transmembrane potential. effects 5-HT proliferation apoptosis PASMCs similar 5-HT1BR agonists markedly prevented 5-HT1BR antagonist, 5-HTT antagonist, combined 5-HT1BR/5-HTT antagonists, EPI, DCA. CONCLUSIONS: 5-HT inhibits PASMC apoptosis 5-HT1BR 5-HTT. pERK1/2 PDK involved process 5-HT inhibition PASMC apoptosis 5-HT1BR 5-HTT.
