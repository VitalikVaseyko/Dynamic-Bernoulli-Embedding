 Cysteinyl residues red cell pyruvate kinase (PK; ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) modified methylmethanethiosulfonate (MMTS), p-nitrophenoxycarbonyl methyl disulfide (NPCMD), sodium tetrathionate (NaTT). pH greater 7 . 0, K0.5 phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) markedly increased. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) increased affinity PEP, K0.5 (PEP) remained elevated hyperbolic kinetics achieved. Inhibition negative effectors ATP alanine reversed PEP FDP concentrations far greater abolishing inhibition unmodified enzyme. pH less 7 . 0, PEP affinity reduced, FDP markedly increased Vmax diminished K0.5 (PEP). MMTS greatly impaired thermostability PK. Acid pH alone simultaneous presence Mg++, K+ PEP prior MMTS treatment protected effects PEP kinetics, alter induction thermolability. MMTS effect FDP binding site, ADP kinetics relative effectiveness GDP, UDP CDP cofactors demonstrated. MMTS-induced alterations closely resembled observed certain PK mutants associated haemolytic anaemia.
