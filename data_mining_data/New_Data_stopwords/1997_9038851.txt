 use labeling pattern hepatic glutamate infusion L-[3-13C]- [3-14C]lactate calculate rates citric acid cycle activity gluconeogenesis proposed. tested validity approach perfusing isolated rat livers (48 h starved) pyruvate lactate (10% enriched [3-13C]lactate) without (control) infusion glucagon (to inhibit pyruvate kinase), mercaptopicolinate (to inhibit phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), dichloroacetate (to stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase). Compared control experiments, glucagon increased glucose output (P < 0.05) decreased calculated flux pyruvate kinase (P < 0.05). Mercaptopicolinate almost totally suppressed glucose production dramatically reduced calculated gluconeogenic rate flux phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (P < 0.001). Dichloroacetate moderately increased calculated flux pyruvate dehydrogenase (P < 0.05). experiments perfused livers fed rats, calculated gluconeogenic rate flux phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase low compared control experiments (P < 0.001), whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase flux increased (P < 0.05). Therefore, expected modifications citric acid cycle activity gluconeogenic rate clearly detected using labeling pattern glutamate calculate metabolic rates. Except perfusions mercaptopicolinate, dilution isotopic exchange oxaloacetate pool calculated model agreed actual dilution enrichment liver pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate. present results support validity approach trace liver metabolism.
