 obtain red cell populations increasing mean age erythropoiesis arrested continuous actinomycin treatment maintained transfusion polycythemia mice rats respectively. parameters studied included cell indices, enzyme activities rheological characteristics. Further, life-span aged cells compared normal, sequestration site determined. Mice erythrocytes, like rats, exerienced continuous decrease MCV1, early rise MCHC, late MCH reduction. ageing rat erythrocytes activities HK, GR 6-PGD fall normal range first 9 tenths potential life-span. hand, borderline reduction PK activity found, activity G-6PD underwent steady though unimpressive decrease 70% physiological average. Aged erythrocytes, forced 15-mum capillaries differed apparent viscosity reticulocytes normal cells factor 1.31 1.16, respectively. Destruction senescent cells predominantly confined spleen, prolonged erythrocyte survival followed splenectomy.
