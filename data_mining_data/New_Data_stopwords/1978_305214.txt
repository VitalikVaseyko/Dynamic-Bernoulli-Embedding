 influence ochratoxin enzyme activities content free adenine nucleotides intermediates glycolysis rat lenses investigated. period eight weeks, five times weekly, albino Wistat rats received ochratoxin 0.1% NaHCO3, dosed 1/100 LD50, via stomach tube. measurements made end experiment. Decreased contents ATP, G-6-P, sum fructose, F-6-P observed, pyruvic acid, AMP, DAP increased. Relatively decreased activities enzymes MDH, ALD, HK, GK, PK established. influence ochratoxin carbohydrate metabolism rat lenses respect tranparency discussed. significant differences absolute lens weight animals treated ochratoxin controls.
