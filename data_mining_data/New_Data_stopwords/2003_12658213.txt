 OBJECTIVE: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate high-energy intermediate anaerobic metabolism. enhances glycolysis, preserves cellular adenosine triphosphate, prevents increase intracellular calcium ischemia. potential neuroprotective effect fructose-1,6-bisphosphate hypothermic circulatory arrest evaluated surviving porcine model. METHODS: Twenty-four pigs randomly assigned receive two intravenous infusions either fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (500 mg/kg) saline solution. first infusion given immediately 75-minute period hypothermic circulatory arrest second given immediately hypothermic circulatory arrest. RESULTS: 7-day survivals 83.3% fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group 41.7% control group (P =.09). treated animals significantly better postoperative behavioral scores. administration fructose-1,6-bisphosphate associated higher venous phosphate sodium levels, lower venous ionized calcium levels, higher blood osmolarity, better fluid balance. Intracranial pressure venous creatine kinase isoenzyme MB significantly lower fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group rewarming (P =.01 P =.001, respectively). Among treated animals, brain glucose, pyruvate lactate levels tended higher, brain glycerol levels tended lower, histopathologic score brain significantly lower (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous administration fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 500 mg/kg hypothermic circulatory arrest surviving porcine model associated better survival, behavioral outcome, histopathologic score. observed lower blood creatine kinase isoenzyme MB brain glycerol levels higher brain glucose, pyruvate, lactate levels fructose-1,6-bisphosphate group suggest drug supportive effects myocardial brain metabolisms.
