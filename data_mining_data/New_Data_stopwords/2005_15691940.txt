 Lactose soluble economically feasible carbon source production cellulases heterologous proteins regulated cellulase expression signals Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei). investigated role major beta-galactosidase H. jecorina lactose metabolism cellulase induction. genomic copy bga1 gene cloned, copy encodes 1,023-amino-acid protein 20-amino-acid signal sequence. protein molecular mass 109.3 kDa, belongs glycosyl hydrolase family 35, major extracellular beta-galactosidase growth lactose. transcript abundant growth l-arabinose l-arabinitol much less common organism grown lactose, d-galactose, galactitol, d-xylose, xylitol. Deltabga1 strains grow slowly accumulate less biomass lactose, cellobiohydrolase II gene expression final cellulase yields comparable parental strain. Overexpression bga1 control pyruvate kinase promoter reduced lag phase, increased growth lactose, limited transcription cellobiohydrolases. detected additional extracellular beta-galactosidase activity encoded bga1 intracellular beta-galactosidase activity. conclusion, cellulase production lactose occurs beta-galactosidase activity levels low decreases beta-galactosidase activities increase. data indicate bga1-encoded beta-galactosidase activity critical factor cellulase production lactose.
