 hypermetabolic nature cancer cells increased reliance "aerobic glycolysis", originally described Otto Warburg colleagues, considered metabolic hallmarks cancer cells. BRCA1 major tumor suppressor breast cancer implicated numerous pathways resulting anticarcinogenic functions. objective study address specific contributions BRCA1 metabolic features cancer cells, including so-called "Warburg effect". get comprehensive approach role BRCA1 tumor cell metabolism, performed global transcriptional metabolite profiling BRCA1-mutated breast cancer cell line transfected wild-type BRCA1. study revealed BRCA1 induced numerous modifications metabolism, including strong inhibition glycolysis TCA cycle oxidative phosphorylation tended activated. Regulation AKT BRCA1 cell model BRCA1-mutated breast tumors suggested participate effect BRCA1 glycolysis. could also show BRCA1 induced decrease ketone bodies free fatty acids, maybe consumed supply Acetyl-CoA TCA cycle. Finally increased activity antioxidation pathways observed BRCA1-transfected cells, could consequence ROS production activated oxidative phosphorylation. study suggests new function BRCA1 cell metabolic regulation, globally resulting reversion Warburg effect. could represent new mechanism BRCA1 may exert tumor suppressor function.
