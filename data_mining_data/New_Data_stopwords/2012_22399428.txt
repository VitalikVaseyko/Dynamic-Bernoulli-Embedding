 beginning twentieth century, Otto Warburg demonstrated cancer cells peculiar metabolism. cells preferentially utilise glycolysis energetic anabolic purposes, producing large quantities lactic acid. defined unusual metabolism "aerobic glycolysis". time, Warburg hypothesised disruption mitochondrial activities played precise pathogenic role cancer. so-called "Warburg effect", mitochondrial physiology cellular respiration particular overlooked pathophysiological studies cancer. time, however, many studies shown mitochondria play fundamental role cell death apoptosis necrosis. Moreover, metabolic enzymes Krebs cycle also recently recognised oncosuppressors. Recently, series studies undertaken re-evaluate role oxidative mitochondrial metabolism cancer cell growth progression. data indicate modulation mitochondrial respiration may induce arrest cancer cell proliferation differentiation (pseudodifferentiation) and/or death, suggesting iatrogenic manipulation mitochondrial activities may induce anticancer effects. Moreover, studying role mitochondria cancer cell dedifferentiation/differentiation processes may allow insight pathophysiology therapy so-called cancer stem cells.
