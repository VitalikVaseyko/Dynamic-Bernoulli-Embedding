 crude membrane fraction promastigotes Leishmania donovani grown liquid culture medium containing 20% fetal calf serum prepared freeze-thawing, centrifugation (200,000 X g, 30 min), extraction 2% (w/v) sodium cholate. removal bile salt chromatography Sephadex G-75 column, solubilized membrane protein fraction, rich acid phosphatase activity, chromatographed columns containing concanavalin A-Sepharose, QAE-Sephadex, Sephadex G-150 G-100. Three distinct acid phosphatases resolved: major phosphatase activity (70% total) L-(+)-tartrate-resistant (designated ACP-P1) corresponds acid phosphatase localized outer surface parasite's plasma membrane; two phosphatases (ACP-P2 ACP-P3) account remaining 30% particulate acid phosphatase activity, enzymes L-(+)-tartrate-sensitive. Using combination sucrose density gradient centrifugation, gel filtration chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, determined ACP-P1 128,000-dalton protein composed two subunits 65,000-68,000 daltons. ACP-P1 isoelectric point 4.1, pH optimum 5.5, hydrolyzes fructose 1,6-diphosphate, sugar phosphates dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine, yeast mannan, phosphorylated form rat liver pyruvate kinase. ACP-P2 (pI, 5.4) ACP-P3 (pI, 7.1) molecular masses 132,000 108,000 daltons, respectively, tartrate-sensitive distinguished basis sensitivity inhibition polyanionic molybdenum complexes. two phosphatases also pH optima pH 5.0-6.0 range, considerably broader substrate specificity ACP-P1.
