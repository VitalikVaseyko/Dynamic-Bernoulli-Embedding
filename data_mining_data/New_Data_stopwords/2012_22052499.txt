 advantage studying allosteric regulation covalent modification allostery allows experimentalist vary concentration effector, thereby allowing independent quantification effector binding allosteric coupling. turn, capacity allows use effector analogues determine regions effector contribute effector binding contribute allosteric regulation. Like many proteins, human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) regulated phosphorylation. phosphorylation hL-PYK occurs Ser12 N-terminus. Phosphorylation appears interrupt interaction (distant active site) N-terminus main body protein. Since interaction increases affinity hL-PYK substrate (phosphoenolpyruvate, PEP), phosphorylation-dependent interruption N-terminus/main-body interaction results antagonism PEP binding. Due advantages studying allosteric system, detail protocol express purify N-terminal peptides hL-PYK using SUMO-fusion system. demonstrate peptides act allosteric regulators modulate affinity hL-PYK PEP.
