 Prolonged endurance training causes decreased O2 affinity Hb, due increase erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration. Possible mechanisms studied 20 males varying degrees fitness. Training status tested ergometry. Red cell density O2 transport parameters determined test. O2 tension 50% O2 saturation Hb (P50) higher fit subjects (+1.3 mmHg) 2,3-DPG concentration higher (+2.3 mumol/g Hb) group. mean density significantly lower fit subjects (1.1002 g/ml) compared less fit subjects (1.1056 g/ml), indicating lower mean age. Density distribution curves show fit subjects young erythrocytes blood old erythrocytes missing. correction differences density distribution, differences P50 value 2,3-DPG concentration less fit fit subjects found. Therefore, decreased Hb-O2 affinity training explained presence young erythrocytes blood trained subjects. magnitude effect correlates training status.
