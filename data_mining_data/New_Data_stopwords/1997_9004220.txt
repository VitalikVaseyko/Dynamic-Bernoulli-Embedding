 Bacillus subtilis SpoIIE Ser protein phosphatase whose action phosphoprotein SpoIIAA triggers cell type-specific activation sporulation transcription factor. report SpoIIE displays sequence similarity PP2C family eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, residues common proteins required function SpoIIE TPD1, yeast PP2C. findings suggest SpoIIE PP2C protein phosphatases structurally related, reveal striking formal similarity SpoIIAA regulatory circuit mammalian mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase. similarity may reflect evolutionarily conserved mechanism biological regulation based interplay protein kinase-like Ser kinases PP2C-like protein phosphatases.
