 BACKGROUND: Canine mammary tumors represent common neoplasm female dogs, discovery cancer biomarkers translation clinical relevant assays key requirement war cancer. Since description 'Warburg effect', reprogramming metabolic pathways considered hallmark pathological changes cancer cells. study, investigate expression two cancer-related metabolic enzymes, transketolase (TKT) transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1), involved pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), alternative metabolic pathway glucose breakdown could promote cancer providing precursors energy required rapidly growing cells. RESULTS: TKT TKTL1 protein expression investigated immunohistochemistry canine normal (N = 6) hyperplastic glands (N = 3), well benign (N = 11) malignant mammary tumors (N = 17). TKT expression higher hyperplastic lesions benign malignant tumors compared normal mammary gland, TKTL1 levels remarkably higher hyperplastic lesions, simple adenomas simple carcinomas normal mammary glands (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: study reveals expression key PPP enzyme varies along evolution canine mammary neoplastic lesions, supports role metabolic changes development canine mammary tumors.
