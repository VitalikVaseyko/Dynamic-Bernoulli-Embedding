 study describes properties clone immortalized cells (m-ICc12 cells) derived bases small intestinal villi 20-day-old fetuses L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK)/ TAg1 transgenic mice. mice harbor simian virus 40 large antigen control 5' regulatory sequence L-PK gene. m-ICc12 cells expressed nuclear large antigen, prolonged life span, nontumorigenic injected nude mice. formed confluent monolayers cuboid cells separated tight junctions, developed dense, short apical microvilli, formed domes. also possessed cytokeratins, villin, aminopeptidase N, dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, glucoamylase retained crypt cell features, including intracellular sucrase isomaltase alpha-L-fucose glycoconjugates accumulation expression polymeric immunoglobulin receptor cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Thus m-ICc12 cell line obtained targeted oncogenesis transgenic mice maintained culture several important properties differentiated functions intestinal crypt cells.
