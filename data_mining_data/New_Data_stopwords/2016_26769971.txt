 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) highly vulnerable site diabetic neuropathy. diabetic conditions, DRG subjected tissue ischemia lower ambient oxygen tension leads aberrant metabolic functions. Metabolic dysfunctions documented play crucial role pathogenesis diverse pain hypersensitivities. However, contribution diabetes-induced metabolic dysfunctions DRG pathogenesis painful diabetic neuropathy remains ill-explored. study, report pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK2 PDK4), key regulatory enzymes glucose metabolism, mediate glycolytic metabolic shift DRG leading painful diabetic neuropathy. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes substantially enhanced expression activity PDKs DRG, genetic ablation Pdk2 Pdk4 attenuated hyperglycemia-induced pain hypersensitivity. Mechanistically, Pdk2/4 deficiency inhibited diabetes-induced lactate surge, expression pain-related ion channels, activation satellite glial cells, infiltration macrophages DRG, addition reducing central sensitization neuroinflammation hallmarks spinal cord, probably accounts attenuated pain hypersensitivity. Pdk2/4-deficient mice partly resistant diabetes-induced loss peripheral nerve structure function. Furthermore, experiments using DRG neuron cultures, lactic acid treatment enhanced expression ion channels compromised cell viability. Finally, pharmacological inhibition DRG PDKs lactic acid production substantially attenuated diabetes-induced pain hypersensitivity. Taken together, PDK2/4 induction subsequent lactate surge induce metabolic shift diabetic DRG, thereby contributing pathogenesis painful diabetic neuropathy.
