 Lactobacillus plantarum P5 grew aerobically rich media expense lactate; growth observed absence aeration. oxygen-dependent growth accompanied conversion lactate acetate accumulated growth medium. Utilization oxygen lactate substrate observed buffered suspensions washed whole cells cell-free extracts. pathway accounts generation adenosine triphosphate aerobic metabolism lactate acetate via pyruvate acetyl phosphate proposed. enzyme activities involved, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide independent lactic dehydrogenase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent lactic dehydrogenase, pyruvate oxidase, acetate kinase NADH oxidase demonstrated cell-free extracts. production pyruvate, acetyl phosphate acetate demonstrated using cell-free extracts cofactors enzymes proposed pathway.
