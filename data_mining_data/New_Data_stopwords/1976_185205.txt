 N6,O2-Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) inhibits gluconeogenesis lactate formation increases ketogenesis isolated liver cells incubated high concentrations pyruvate. inhibitory effects explained basis inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex change NAD+ oxidation-reduction potential mitochondrial compartment. oleate 3-hydroxybutyrate substantially increase rates gluconeogenesis lactate formation pyruvate overcome inhibition caused Bt2cAMP. decreased effectiveness pyruvate kinase proposed account inhibition gluconeogenesis lactate formation Bt2cAMP. enzyme catalyzes step required transfer reducing equivalents mitochondrial compartment cytoplasm participates formation glucose lactate pyruvate overall reaction: 2 pyruvate- + 2 NADHmito + 4 ATP4- + 4 H2O leads 1/2 glucose + lactate- + 2 NAD+ mito + 4 ADP3- + 4 HPO4(2)- + H+. Inhibition pyruvate kinase promotes gluconeogenesis substrates inhibits gluconeogenesis pyruvate want cytoplasmic reducing equivalents.
