 emergent discipline metabolomics attracted considerable research effort hepatology. review metabolomic data non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), hepatitis B C, cholecystitis, cholestasis, liver transplantation, acute hepatotoxicity animal models. metabolomic window permitted view changing biochemistry occurring transitional phases healthy liver hepatocellular carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma. Whether provoked obesity diabetes, alcohol use oncogenic viruses, liver develops core metabolomic phenotype (CMP) involves dysregulation bile acid phospholipid homeostasis. CMP commences transition healthy liver (Phase 0) NAFLD/NASH, ALD viral hepatitis (Phase 1). CMP maintained presence absence cirrhosis (Phase 2) whether either HCC CCA (Phase 3) develops. Inflammatory signalling liver triggers appearance CMP. Many metabolomic markers distinguish Phases 0, 1, 2 3. metabolic remodelling HCC described metabolomic data four Phases demonstrate Warburg shift mitochondrial respiration cytosolic glycolysis foreshadows HCC may occur early Phase 1. metabolic remodelling also involves upregulation fatty acid beta-oxidation, also beginning Phase 1. storage triglycerides fatty liver provides high energy-yielding substrates Phases 2 3 liver pathology. metabolomic window hepatobiliary disease sheds new light systems pathology liver.
