 fermentation carried solvent-producing bacterium, Clostridium acetobutylicum, characterized two distinct phases: acidogenic solventogenic phases. Understanding cellular physiological changes occurring phase transition clostridial fermentation important enhanced production solvents. identify protein changes upon entry stationary phase solvents typically produced, herein analyzed proteomic profiles parental wild type C. acetobutylicum strains, ATCC 824, non-solventogenic strain, M5 lost solventogenic megaplasmid pSOL1, synthetic simplified alcohol forming strain, M5 (pIMP1E1AB) expressing plasmid-based CoA-transferase (CtfAB) aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE1). total 68 protein spots, corresponding 56 unique proteins, unambiguously identified differentially present phase transitions three C. acetobutylicum strains. addition changes proteins known involved solventogenesis (AdhE1 CtfB), identified significant alterations enzymes involved sugar transport metabolism, fermentative pathway, heat shock proteins, translation, amino acid biosynthesis upon entry stationary phase. these, four increased proteins (AdhE1, CAC0233, CtfB phosphocarrier protein HPr) six decreased proteins (butyrate kinase, ferredoxin:pyruvate oxidoreductase, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, adenylosuccinate synthase, pyruvate kinase valyl-tRNA synthetase) showed similar patterns two strains capable butanol formation. Interestingly, significant changes several proteins post-translational modifications observed solventogenic phase. proteomic data study improve understanding cell physiology affected protein levels patterns clostridia.
