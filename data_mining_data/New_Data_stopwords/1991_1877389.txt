 importance value applying metabolic-control logic question fuels, rates utilization significance process proliferation presented. Application recently developed quantitative theory metabolic control branched pathways provides hypothesis account high rate glycolysis glutaminolysis lymphocytes, macrophages and, particular, tumor cells. glycolysis glutaminolysis provide metabolic intermediates biosynthetic pathways: example, glucose-6-phosphate formation ribose-5-phosphate, glutamine, ammonia aspartate required synthesis purine pyrimidine nucleotides. However, rates glycolysis glutaminolysis greatly excess (greater 400-fold) requirements biosynthetic processes. energy formation per se major reason high rate glutamine utilization, oxidation partial? ability cell divide require synthesis DNA, RNA, phospholipids, etc., precise times cell cycle. Hence high accurate sensitivity processes provide precursors compounds specific regulators expected. Maintenance high rates glycolysis glutaminolysis times seen therefore device allow intermediates "tapped off" precise rate required whenever needed biosynthesis. Maximal activities key enzymes glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle glutaminolysis variety normal, neoplastic suppressed cells presented. relative activities hexokinase 6-phosphofructokinase suggest that, particularly neoplastic cells, capacity glucose transport high, hexokinase could approach saturation respect intracellular glucose; consequently, hexokinase phosphofructokinase could play important role regulation glycolytic flux cells. activity pyruvate kinase considerably higher tumorigenic cells nontumorigenic cells higher metastatic cells tumorigenic cells: nontumorigenic cells activities range 28.4 574, tumorigenic cells 899 1280, metastatic cells 1590 1627 nmol/min per mg protein. ratio pyruvate kinase activity 2 x phosphofructokinase activity high neoplastic cells. mean 22.4 neoplastic cells, whereas muscle 60 different animals 3.8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
