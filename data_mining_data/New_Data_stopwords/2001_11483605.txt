 structure mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 2 interest represents family serine-specific protein kinases lack sequence similarity eukaryotic protein kinases. Similarity exists instead key motifs prokaryotic histidine protein kinases family eukaryotic ATPases. 2.5-A crystal structure reported reveals pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 2 two domains size. N-terminal half dominated bundle four amphipathic alpha-helices, whereas C-terminal half folded alpha/beta sandwich contains nucleotide-binding site. Analysis structure reveals C-terminal domain similar nucleotide-binding domain bacterial histidine kinases, catalytic mechanism appears similar eukaryotic serine kinases ATPases.
