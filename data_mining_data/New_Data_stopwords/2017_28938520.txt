 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) sixth common cancer. Warburg effect important way HCC adapts hypoxic environment. aim present study determine whether galangin reverses Warburg effect HCC cells. treated three HCC cell lines, HepG2, Hep3B PLC/PRF/5 galangin 24h, respectively. Cell proliferation measured MTT assay. Glucose uptake, lactate production oxygen consumption measured. Pyruvate kinase activities detected measuring consumption NADH, glycolytic pathway-related proteins measured Western blotting. results showed galangin suppressed proliferation HCC cells, decreased glucose absorption lactate production HCC. addition, galangin also gave rise increased oxygen consumption three HCC cell lines. treatment galangin, activity pyruvate kinase up-regulated expression levels glycolytic pathway-related proteins changed. results suggest galangin suppresses Warburg effect HCC cells, indicating galangin might potential therapeutic agent HCC.
