 Proliferating cancer cells characterized high rates glycolysis, lactate production, altered mitochondrial metabolism. metabolic reprogramming provides important metabolites proliferation tumor cells, including glioblastoma. biological processes, however, generate oxidative stress must balanced detoxification reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using unbiased retroviral loss-of-function screen nontransformed human astrocytes, demonstrate mitochondrial PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) regulator Warburg effect negative regulator glioblastoma growth. report loss PINK1 contributes Warburg effect ROS-dependent stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor-1A reduced pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 activity, key regulators aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistically, PINK1 suppresses ROS tumor growth FOXO3a, master regulator oxidative stress superoxide dismutase 2. findings highlight importance PINK1 ROS balance normal tumor cells. PINK1 loss observed significant number human brain tumors including glioblastoma (n > 900) correlated poor patient survival. PINK1 overexpression attenuates vivo glioblastoma growth orthotopic mouse xenograft models transgenic glioblastoma model Drosophila Cancer Res; 76(16); 4708-19. (c)2016 AACR.
