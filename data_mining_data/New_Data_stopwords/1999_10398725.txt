 Whole-plant diurnal C exchange analysis provided noninvasive estimation daily net C gain transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants deficient leaf cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc-). PKc- plants cultivated low light intensity (100 &mgr;mol m-2 s-1) previously shown exhibit markedly reduced root growth, well delayed shoot flower development compared plants wild-type levels PKc (PKc+). PKc- PKc+ source leaves showed similar net C gain, photosynthesis range light intensities, capacity export newly fixed 14CO2 photosynthesis. However, growth low light nighttime, export previously fixed 14CO2 fully expanded PKc- leaves 40% lower, whereas concurrent respiratory 14CO2 evolution 40% higher PKc+ leaves. provides rationale reduced root growth PKc- plants grown low irradiance. Leaf photosynthetic export characteristics PKc- PKc+ plants raised greenhouse winter months resembled plants grown chambers low irradiance. data suggest PKc source leaves critical role regulating nighttime respiration particularly available pool photoassimilates export leaf respiratory processes low.
