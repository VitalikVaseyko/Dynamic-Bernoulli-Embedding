 Drought-tolerant wild watermelon accumulates high levels citrulline leaves response drought conditions. work, hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity citrulline investigated vitro. second-order rate constant reaction citrulline hydroxyl radicals found 3.9x10(9) M(-1) s(-1), demonstrating citrulline one efficient scavengers among compatible solutes examined far. Moreover, citrulline effectively protected DNA enzyme oxidative injuries. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed least four major products formed reaction citrulline hydroxyl radicals. Activities metabolic enzymes inhibited 600 mM citrulline, indicating citrulline interfere cellular metabolism. reasoned, results, citrulline contributes oxidative stress tolerance drought conditions novel hydroxyl radical scavenger.
