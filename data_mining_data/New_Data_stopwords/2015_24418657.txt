 Eugenol phenylpropanoid many pharmacological activities, anti-hyperglycemic activity yet fully explored. vitro study, HepG2 cells primary rat hepatocytes used, glucose production induced adding 100 nM glucagon presence gluconeogenic substrates. animal study, hyperglycemia induced high fat diet (HFD) male C57BL/6J mice, eugenol orally administered 20 40 mg per kg (E20, E40) 15 weeks. Eugenol significantly inhibited glucagon-induced glucose production phosphorylated AMPK HepG2 primary rat hepatocytes, effects reversed presence compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) STO-609 (a CAMKK inhibitor). addition, protein gene expression levels CREB, CRTC2.CREB complex, PGC-1alpha, PEPCK G6Pase significantly suppressed. Moreover, inhibition AMPK over-expression dominant negative AMPK prevented eugenol suppressions gluconeogenic gene expression hepatic glucose production. animal study, plasma glucose insulin levels E40 group decreased 31% 63%, respectively, compared HFD control. pyruvate tolerance tests, pyruvate-induced glucose excursions decreased, indicating anti-hyperglycemic activity eugenol primarily due suppression hepatic gluconeogenesis. summary, eugenol effectively ameliorates hyperglycemia inhibition hepatic gluconeogenesis via modulating CAMKK-AMPK-CREB signaling pathway. Eugenol eugenol-containing medicinal plants could represent promising therapeutic agent prevent type 2 diabetes.
