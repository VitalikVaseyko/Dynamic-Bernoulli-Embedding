 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex purified homogeneity bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity detected stage purification. However, purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphorylated inactivated purified pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase bovine kidney. protein-bound radioactivity localized pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha subunit. phosphorylated, inactive pyruvate dehydrogenase complex dephosphorylated reactivated purified pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase bovine heart. Tryptic digestion 32P-labeled complex yielded single phosphopeptide, purified homogeneity. sequence phosphopeptide established Tyr-Gly-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asp-Pro-Gly-Thr-Thr-Tyr-Arg. sequence similar sequence tryptic phosphotetradecapeptide derived alpha subunit bovine kidney heart pyruvate dehydrogenase: Tyr-His-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asp-Pro-Gly-Val-Ser-Tyr-Arg.
