 Pyruvate carboxylase sole anaplerotic enzyme glucose-grown cultures wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pyruvate carboxylase-negative (Pyc(-)) S. cerevisiae strains cannot grow glucose unless media supplemented C(4) compounds, aspartic acid. several succinate-producing prokaryotes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) fulfills anaplerotic role. However, S. cerevisiae PEPCK encoded PCK1 repressed glucose considered purely decarboxylating gluconeogenic function. study investigates whether conditions PEPCK replace anaplerotic function pyruvate carboxylase S. cerevisiae. Pyc(-) S. cerevisiae strains constitutively overexpressing PEPCK either S. cerevisiae Actinobacillus succinogenes grow glucose sole carbon source. However, evolutionary engineering yielded mutants able grow glucose sole carbon source maximum specific growth rate ca. 0.14 h(-1), one-half (pyruvate carboxylase-positive) reference strain grown conditions. Growth dependent high carbon dioxide concentrations, indicating reaction catalyzed PEPCK operates near thermodynamic equilibrium. Analysis reverse engineering two independently evolved strains showed single point mutations pyruvate kinase, competes PEPCK phosphoenolpyruvate, sufficient enable use PEPCK sole anaplerotic enzyme. PEPCK reaction produces one ATP per carboxylation event, whereas original route pyruvate kinase pyruvate carboxylase ATP neutral. increased ATP yield may prove crucial engineering efficient low-cost anaerobic production C(4) dicarboxylic acids S. cerevisiae.
