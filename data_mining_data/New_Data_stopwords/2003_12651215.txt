 Specific antibodies produced ex vivo intestinal culture Eimeria tenella infected chickens. specificity intestinal antibodies tested different parasite stages. antibodies used immunoscreen first generation schizont sporozoite cDNA libraries permitting identification new E. tenella antigens. obtained total 119 cDNA clones subjected sequence analysis. sequences coding proteins inducing local immune responses compared nucleotide protein databases expressed sequence tags (ESTs) databases. identified new Eimeria genes coding heat shock proteins, ribosomal protein, pyruvate kinase pyridoxine kinase. Specific features sequences discussed.
