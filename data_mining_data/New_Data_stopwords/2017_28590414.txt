 Mitochondria consume O(2) produce ATP critical adaption hypoxia, role mitochondria HIF-1alpha pathway yet unclear. study, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) enriched (SK-N-AS) depleted (rho(0)) cells neuroblastoma cultured hypoxic chamber simulate hypoxic condition major components involved mitochondrial related pathways, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) reactive oxygen species (ROS) measured. results showed hypoxia-stimulated exposure elevated expression HIF-1alpha, additionally influenced level generated ROS within cytosol. Moreover, elevation HIF-1alpha also resulted increases lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) hypoxic cells. expression mitochondrial biogenesis related proteins metabolic components noted increase significantly hypoxic SK-N-AS cells, indicating mtDNA involved mitochondrial retrograde signaling metabolic pathways. analysis dynamic proteins found elevated levels HIF-1alpha causing increased expression dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) hypoxia; further, existence mtDNA also resulted higher expression DRP1 hypoxia. using siRNA HIF-1alpha DRP1, expression DRP1 decreased suppression HIF-1alpha; moreover, expression HIF-1alpha also affected suppression DRP1. study, demonstrated mtDNA mediator HIF-1alpha eliciting metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial biogenesis. Identification mutual relationship HIF-1alpha DRP1 may critical tool future development clinical applications.
