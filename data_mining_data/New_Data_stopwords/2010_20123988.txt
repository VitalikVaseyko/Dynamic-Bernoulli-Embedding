 Allosteric regulation provides rate management system enzymes involved many cellular processes. Ligand-controlled regulation easily recognizable, underlying molecular mechanisms remained elusive. obtained first complete series allosteric structures, possible ligated states, tetrameric enzyme, pyruvate kinase, Leishmania mexicana. transition inactive T-state active R-state accompanied simple symmetrical 6 degrees rigid body rocking motion A- C-domain cores four subunits. However, formation R-state way part mechanism; eight essential salt bridge locks form across C-C interface provide tetramer rigidity coupled 7-fold increase rate. results presented illustrate conformational changes coupled effector binding correlate loss flexibility increase thermal stability providing general mechanism allosteric control.
