 cloned sequenced cDNAs R-type pyruvate kinase (R-PK) three homozygous PK patients. point mutation (1151ACG ATG) identified R-PK cDNA PK Nagasaki identical previously identified unrelated family, PK Tokyo. mutation also identified PK L gene Lebanese family, PK Beirut, Neubauer et al (Blood 77:1871, 1991). results suggest either point mutation old mutation occurs sporadically hot spot unrelated families. point mutation, 1261CAG AAG, detected PK Fukushima PK Maebashi; mutation causes single amino acid substitution, Gln421 Lys, R-PK. Consequently, hydrophobicity properties near mutated site drastically changed. silent mutation (1705AGG CGG) also identified variants. screening three point mutations showed silent mutation normal individual well individuals PK variants. results indicate multiplicity mutant PK allele smaller expected, silent mutation polymorphic change commonly distributed Japanese population.
