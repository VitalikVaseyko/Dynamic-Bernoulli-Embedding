 Alanine, serine, phenylalanine behave inhibitors competitive phosphoenolpyruvate activated forms chicken pyruvate kinases. hand, phenylalanine alanine behave K-type inhibitors serine behaves heterotropic activator pyruvate kinase variants undergo homotropic activation. Tryptophan lowers Vm tends yield complex plots variants studied. Kinetic patterns obtained presence phenylalanine also show characteristics generally associated competitive mechanism. observations related data previously obtained using rat isozymes used formulate mechanism explains effects amino acids. mechanism hypothesizes effector amino acids bind phosphoenolpyruvate site; however, amino acids nonpolar side chains also interact nonpolar region conformer thereby stabilize it. proposed two nonpolar regions various pyruvate kinases--the one reacts nonbulky side chains, another reacts relatively bulky side chains. stabilizing effect second nonpolar interaction imparts inhibitory characteristics competitive nature. Serine perhaps polar compounds may also bind phosphoenolpyruvate site, polarity exert repulsive force nonpolar site nonbulky nonpolar amino acids interact. repulsion stabilizes R conformation. Presumably homotropic activating effects phosphoenolpyruvate operate via mechanism. data also used support specific sequential-concerted mechanism homotropic activating effect phosphoenolpyruvate. According mechanism, phosphoenolpyruvate adds sequentially first two subunits. interaction causes respective subunits convert R conformation but, two subunits R conformation, remaining two subunits convert concert.
