 novel approach using aqueous two-phase systems elution protein ligand-coupled particles investigated using pyruvate kinase alcohol dehydrogenase recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cibacron blue F3G-A-coupled Sepharose CL6B (Blue-Sepharose) particles model system. ligand-coupled particles distribute quantitatively polyethylene glycol-(PEG-) rich top phase recovered enzymes partition selectively dextran-(DEX-) rich bottom phase. effective recovery partial purification pyruvate kinase alcohol dehydrogenase Blue-Sepharose particles using PEG8000-DEXT500 aqueous two-phase systems demonstrated modest increase salt concentration. bioselective eluting agent, MgADP, useful chromatographic operations, required process using aqueous two-phase systems. Recovery pyruvate kinase, bound ligand-coupled particles, DEX-rich bottom phase aqueous two-phase systems 95% one-step operations. mixing time ligand-coupled particles aqueous two-phase systems major controlling variable. salt concentration, molecular weight polymer, total volume aqueous two-phase systems also influence recovery pyruvate kinase ligand-coupled particles. recovered enzymes DEX-rich bottom phase remain biologically stable long period storage time. concentration product protein reduced volume easy separation ligand-coupled particles added advantages process using aqueous two-phase systems. Preliminary studies goat polyclonal anti-pyruvate kinase-coupled Sepharose particles indicate process also may applicable high-affinity ligand antibody used. experimental results theoretical derivation based equilibrium models binding/dissociation ligands proteins show process results better recovery compared conventional bulk elution techniques.
