 Perturbation brain protein synthesis methyl mercury chloride (MeHg) compared vivo vitro. MeHg-stimulated and/or inhibited brain cell-free protein synthesis following vivo vitro administration. Although pretreatment GSH protected postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS) vitro inhibition, direct addition -SH compounds reverse vivo vitro perturbations synthesis induced MeHg. Inhibition synthesis induced vivo vitro methyl mercury administration resulted inactivation component(s) brain pH 5 enzymes. Stimulation amino acid incorporation following vivo administration MeHg apparently associated ribosome fraction, vitro preincubation PMS MeHg produced stimulation associated pH 5 enzyme fraction. model MeHg neurotoxicity proposed providing common molecular locus interaction vivo vitro.
