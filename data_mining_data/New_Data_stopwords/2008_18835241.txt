 PRK2/PKNgamma Rho effector member protein kinase C superfamily serine/threonine kinases. Here, explore structure-function relationship various motifs C-terminal half PRK2 kinase activity regulation. report two threonine residues conserved phosphoacceptor position activation loop turn motif essential catalytic activity PRK2, phosphomimetic Asp-978 hydrophobic motif dispensable kinase catalytic competence. Moreover, PRK2-Delta958 mutant turn motif truncated still interacts 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1). Thus, intact hydrophobic motif turn motif PRK2 dispensable binding PDK-1. also found last seven amino acid residues C-terminus PRK2 required activation kinase RhoA vitro, however, extreme C-terminal segment critical full activation PRK2 RhoA cells GTP-dependent manner. data suggest extreme C-terminus PRK2 may represent potential drug target effector-specific pharmacological intervention Rho-medicated biological processes.
