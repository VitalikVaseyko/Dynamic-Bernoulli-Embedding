 Intraneuronal beta-amyloid (Abeta(i)) accumulates early Alzheimer's disease (AD) inclusion body myositis. Several organelles, receptor molecules, homeostatic processes, signal transduction components identified sensitive Abeta. Although prior studies implicate insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, specific step within essential metabolic survival pathway emerged molecular target. tested effect Abeta42 component cascade. AD brain, association PDK Akt, phospho-Akt levels activity decreased relative control. cell culture, Abeta(i) expression inhibited insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation activity. vitro experiments identified beta-amyloid (Abeta), especially oligomer preparations, specifically interrupted PDK-dependent activation Akt. Abeta(i) also blocked association PDK Akt cell-based vitro experiments. Importantly, Abeta interrupt Akt PI3K activities (once stimulated) affect proximal signal events. results offer novel therapeutic strategy neutralize Abeta-induced energy failure neuronal death.
