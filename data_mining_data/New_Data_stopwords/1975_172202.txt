 activity enzymes oxidative non-phosphorylated pathway, glucose gluconate dehydrogenases, significantly affected changes assay temperature. enzymes demonstrated threefold difference activity compared assay temperatures 30 degrees C 5 degrees C. contrast, enzymes involved direct phosphorylation catabolism glucose oxidation products, gluconate 2-ketogluconate, exhibited pronounced response decreasing assay temperatures. least one enzyme pathway, involved direct phosphorylation catabolism glucose 2-ketogluconate (2KG), demonstrated eightfold decrease activity decrease assay temperature 30 degrees C 5 degrees C. similar decrease assay temperature resulted fivefold decrease activity enzymes involved direct phosphorylation catabolism gluconate. observed differential effect temperature activity enzymes glucose catabolism accumulation direct oxidation products growth glucose P. fluorescens E-20 discussed. Growth glucose 5 20 degrees C resulted high induced levels glucose-catabolizing enzymes examined compared levels enzymes pyruvate-grown cells. However, low levels glucose dehydrogenase detected growth 30 degrees C glucose, gluconate, 2-KG. Similarly, low levels gluconate dehydrogenase detected growth glucose 30 degrees C, although weak induction observed growth gluconate 2-KG 30 degrees C. levels 2-KG kinase plus KPG reductase growth 30 degrees C undetectable glucose, weakly induced gluconate, fully induced 2-KG. High induced levels glucose dehydrogenase, gluconate dehydrogenase, 2-KG kinase plus KPG reductase present growth 20 degrees C glucose 2-KG. low levels glucose gluconate dehydrogenases present growth temperature 30 degrees C due heat lability enzymes temperature. low amounts two enzymes growth glucose 30 degrees C probably prevented sufficient inducer(s) formation glucose allow induction enzymes 2-KG catabolism. results demonstrated temperature may regulate pathways glucose dissimilation regulating, either directly indirectly, activity synthesis enzymes involved pathways.
