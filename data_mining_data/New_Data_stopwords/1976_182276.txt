 enzyme ATP-3-phospho-D-glycerate-1-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.2.3) (phosphoglycerate kinase) isolated human red cells crystalline form modification method Yoshida Watanabe (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 440-445). crystalline enzyme purified electrofocusing using carrier ampholytes (pH 7-9). isoelectric point phosphoglycerate kinase estimated 8.75. specific activity purified phosphoglycerate kinase electrofocusing 2200 units per mg protein pH 8.3 (37 degrees C). Enzyme activity assayed forward direction leading 1,3-diphosphoglycerate 3-phosphoglycerate using fluorimetric procedure NAD-coupled enzymes measurement reaction rate low substrate concentrations. auxiliary indicator enzymes added excess yield true initial velocity kinetics, i.e. time lag upon addition substrate (1,3-diphosphoglycerate). established theoretically using mathematical model confirmed experimentally. phosphoglycerate kinase shown rate-limiting step assay conditions varied.
