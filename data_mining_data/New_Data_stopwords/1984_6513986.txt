 Glycogen content, glucose consumption production metabolic end products Calicophoron ijimai determined aerobic anaerobic conditions. major end products fermentation identified lactic, acetic, propionic, isobutyric alpha-methylbutyric acids, propionic acid predominating. activities properties enzymes carbohydrate metabolism determined. worms showed high phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) relatively low pyruvate kinase low lactate dehydrogenase activities. pH optima, coenzyme, cofactor ionic requirements enzymes similar helminths. Malate dehydrogenase 8-fold greater affinity oxaloacetate malate, 14 times active oxaloacetate reduction malate oxidation. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2.4 times active 2-fold greater affinity phosphoenolpyruvate dinucleotide pyruvate kinase. low activities lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase high activities malate dehydrogenase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase suggest anaerobic carbohydrate catabolism follows fumarate reductase pathway.
