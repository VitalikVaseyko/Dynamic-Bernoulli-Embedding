 present study assessed effect lipid metabolism, fat mass obesity-associated gene (FTO), energy metabolism breast cancer cells. human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 MDA-MB-231, HCC1937 human breast cells studied. Real-time PCR used measure levels FTO mRNA breast cancer cells normal breast cells. MDA-MB-231 cells transfected miFTO inhibitor inhibitor control, cells assessed levels lactic acid, ATP, pyruvate kinase activity, hexokinase activity assay using specific kits. Western blot analysis used measure levels phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p-PI3K, protein kinase B (Akt) p-Akt transfected breast cancer cells. expression FTO significantly increased MCF-7 MDA-MB-231 cells compared HCC1937 cells (P<0.01). lactic acid content breast cancer cells transfected miFTO inhibitor significantly lower compared cells transfected miFTO inhibitor control nontransfected cells (P<0.05). ATP content breast cancer cells transfected miFTO inhibitor significantly lower compared control group inhibitor control group (P<0.05). pyruvate kinase activity hexokinase activity breast cancer cells transfected miFTO inhibitor significantly lower compared control group inhibitor control group (P<0.01). Western blot analysis showed breast cancer cells transfected miFTO inhibitor, levels PI3K, p-PI3K, Akt p-Akt significantly lower control group inhibitor control group. conclusion, FTO gene overexpressed breast cancer cells. Overexpression FTO gene promote breast cancer cell glycolysis mechanism related PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
