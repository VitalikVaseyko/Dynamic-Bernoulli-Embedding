 Amyloid-beta peptide Abeta(25-35) shown cause lysis rat erythrocytes different ages. toxicity Abeta(25-35) positively correlated erythrocyte age andthe peptide concentration. activity glycolytic, antioxidant, Na+/K(+)-ATPase enzymes decreased erythrocyte aging vivo. vitro Abeta(25-35) reduced activity hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase increased Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity aged erythrocytes greater degree young cells.
