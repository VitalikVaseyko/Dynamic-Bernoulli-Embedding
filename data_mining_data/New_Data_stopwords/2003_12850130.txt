 Windows program metabolic engineering analysis experimental design developed. graphical user interface enables pictorial, "on-screen" construction metabolic network. model composed, balance equations automatically generated. Model construction, modification information exchange different users thus considerably simplified. given model, program used predict extreme point flux distributions optimize objective function satisfying balances constraints using depth-first search strategy. One also find minimum reaction set satisfies different conditions. Based identified flux distributions linear combinations, user simulate NMR GC/MS spectra selected signal molecules. Alternately, spectra vectorization allows automated optimization labeling experiments intended distinguish different, yet plausible flux extreme point distributions. example provided entails predicting flux distributions associated deleting pyruvate kinase designing 13C NMR experiments maximally discriminate flux distributions.
