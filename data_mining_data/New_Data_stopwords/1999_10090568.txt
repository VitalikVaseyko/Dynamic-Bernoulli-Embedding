 percentages motile sperm (%MO), hyperactivated sperm (%HA), acrosome-reacted sperm (%AR) four beagle dogs asthenozoospermia (AS) five normal beagle dogs determined 7 h incubation. metabolic enzyme activities sperm examined 0 4 h incubation. sperm incubated canine capacitation medium (CCM) CCM containing either 20 microg ml(-1) heparin (HE), 10 microg ml(-1) theophylline (TH) 20 microg ml(-1) + 10 microg ml(-1) TH glass tubes 38 degrees C 5% CO2 air. %HA %AR determined counting sperm exhibiting star-spin like movement triple stain technique. spermatozoa + TH CCM homogenized centrifuged, metabolic activities hexokinase, fructokinase, glucose-6-phosphodehydrogenase (G6PD), pyruvate kinase sperm cytosol supernatant measured spectrophotometer. mean %MO %HA values normal dogs four types CCM highest + TH CCM, mean %HA + TH CCM 78 +/- 5% (S.E.) 7 h incubation. However, little difference %AR among four types CCM. mean activities four enzymes sperm dogs incubation significantly lower sperm normal dogs (P < 0.05, 0.01). However, 4 h incubation activities enzymes sperm normal dogs clearly higher + TH CCM control CCM. findings indicate TH medium effective inactivating metabolic enzymes, maintaining longer sperm motility, efficiently inducing HA even sperm dogs.
