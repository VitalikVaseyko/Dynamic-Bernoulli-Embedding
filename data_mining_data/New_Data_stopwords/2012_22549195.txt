 Immobilization osteoporosis big issue modern societies aging population. Mechanical stress essential maintaining bone mass ; however, mechanism regulation bone mass osteocyte network, comprises communication system processes canaliculi throughout bone, still remains clarified. Therefore, urgent reveal mechanism bone mass regulation loaded unloaded conditions physiological functions osteocyte network osteoblasts osteoclasts using appropriate mouse models mouse line disrupted osteocyte function. identified novel mechanical stress-responsible molecule, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) , whose expression upregulated osteoblasts unloaded condition, using mouse model disrupted osteocyte function. found Pdk4 regulates Rankl expression osteoblasts signal osteocyte network induces osteoclastogenesis bone resorption unloaded condition. analyses using appropriate mouse models gradually revealing physiological roles osteocyte network, difficult examine long time anatomic sites osteocytes embedded bone matrix.
