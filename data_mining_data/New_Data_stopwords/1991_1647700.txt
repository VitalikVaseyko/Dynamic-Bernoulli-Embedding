 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2) analyzed four organs anoxia-tolerant marine gastropod mollusk Busycon canaliculatum. Whelk PFK-2 resembled nonhepatic enzyme mammals highest activity occurring gill (22 pmol.min-1.g-1). Hepatopancreas PFK-2 purified 8,000-fold final specific activity 11 mU/mg protein (at 20 degrees C) gave single band sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. enzyme dimer native molecular mass 142 kDa subunit molecular mass 67 kDa. purified enzyme showed negligible fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-2) activity, although activity ratio PFK-2 FBPase-2 0.625 crude extracts. response environmental anoxia, activity PFK-2 dropped organs 34-56% corresponding aerobic value (half-time 2 h gill), Michaelis constant fructose 6-phosphate increased 50% (to 92 microM gill). changes paralleled decreases organ fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration pyruvate kinase activity contribute overall glycolytic rate depression induced anoxia facultative anaerobe. vitro treatment anoxic form hepatopancreas PFK-2 alkaline phosphatase increased enzyme activity, suggesting aerobic anoxic enzyme forms interconverted reversible protein phosphorylation. However, protein kinase involved process yet known; incubation aerobic PFK-2 Mg-ATP plus adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase protein kinase C alter enzyme activity.
