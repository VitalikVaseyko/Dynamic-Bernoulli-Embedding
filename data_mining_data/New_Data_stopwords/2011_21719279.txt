 Levoglucosan major product biomass pyrolysis. pyrolyzed biomass, also known bio-oil, contains sugars attractive fermentation substrate, commonly-used biocatalysts, Escherichia coli, lack ability metabolize anhydrosugar. previously shown recombinant expression levoglucosan kinase enzyme enables use levoglucosan carbon energy source. Here, ethanologenic E. coli KO11 engineered levoglucosan utilization recombinant expression levoglucosan kinase Lipomyces starkeyi. engineering strategy uses codon-optimized gene chromosomally integrated within pyruvate ethanol (PET) operon require additional antibiotics inducers. engineered strain use levoglucosan sole carbon source, also ferments levoglucosan ethanol. work demonstrates existing biocatalysts easily modified levoglucosan utilization.
