 effect dietary amylose/amylopectin (AM/AP) ratio growth, feed utilization, digestive enzyme activities, plasma parameters, postprandial blood glucose responses evaluated juvenile obscure puffer, Takifugu obscurus. Five isonitrogenous (430 g kg(-1) crude protein) isolipidic (90 g kg(-1) crude lipid) diets containing equal starch level (250 g kg(-1) starch) different AM/AP ratio diets 0/25, 3/22, 6/19, 9/16 12/13 formulated. experimental diet fed triplicate groups (25 fish per tank), twice daily period 60 days. growth trial, postprandial blood response test carried out. Fish fed diet 6/19 showed best growth, feed efficiency protein efficiency ratio. Hepatosomatic index, plasma total cholesterol concentration, liver glycogen lipid content, gluconokinase, pyruvate kinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activities lower fish fed highest AM/AP diet (12/13) fish fed low-amylose diets. Activities liver intestinal trypsin fish fed diet 3/22 diet 6/19 higher fish fed diet 9/16 diet 12/13. Activities liver intestinal amylase intestinal lipase, starch digestibility negatively correlated dietary AM/AP ratio. Fish fed diet 3/22 diet 6/19 showed higher plasma total amino acid concentration fish fed diets, plasma urea nitrogen concentration activities alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase showed opposite trend. Equal values found viscerosomatic index condition factor, whole body muscle composition, plasma high-density low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, activities lipase hexokinase glucose-6-phosphatase liver. Postprandial plasma glucose triglyceride peak value fish fed diet 12/13 lower fish fed low-amylose diets, peak time plasma glucose later fish fed diets. Plasma glucose triglyceride concentrations showed significant difference 2 4 h meal varied dietary treatments. According regression analysis weight gain dietary AM/AP ratio, optimum dietary AM/AP ratio maximum growth obscure puffer 0.25. present result indicates dietary AM/AP ratio could affect growth performance feed utilization, plasma parameters, digestive enzyme well hepatic glucose metabolic enzyme activities juvenile obscure puffer.
