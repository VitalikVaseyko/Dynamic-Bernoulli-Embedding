 B16-F10 B16-BL6 B16 mouse melanoma sublines preferentially metastasize lung following i.v. s.c. injections, respectively. study molecular mechanisms underlying different metastatic behaviors exhibited B16 melanoma sublines, performed differential hybridization genes transcribed cells compared expression levels. isolated four genes highly expressed B16-F10 cells B16-BL6 cells: TI-225 (polyubiquitin), TI-229 (pyruvate kinase), TI-241 (LRF-1 homologue), TI-227 (novel gene). Triosephosphate isomerase, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, tyrosinase-related protein 2, cytochrome c oxidase, ATP synthetase alpha subunit, RNA helicase, ribosomal protein (L37, J1, acidic phosphoprotein), however, showed higher expression B16-BL6 cells B16-F10 cells. Among clones, transfection TI-241 low metastatic clone F1 converted parental cells low- high-metastatic cells. TI-241 may regulate expression various genes transcription factor complex process metastasis.
