 Betanin, chromoalkaloid beetroot, shown significant biological effects antioxidants, anti-inflammatory anticarcinogenic activities. So, attempted determine whether betanin (a natural pigment) would protective hyperglycemia streptozotocin (STZ) - nicotinamide (NA) induced diabetic rats. Rats injected STZ (40mg/kgb.w.) 15 mins administration NA (110mg/kgb.w.) intraperitonially (i.p.) 30days induction experimental diabetes mellitus. 72h diabetic rats treated betanin orally doses 10, 20 40mg/kg b.w., respectively dose dependent manner glibenclamide (600mug/kgb.w.). promising character betanin diabetic rats evaluated performing various biochemical parameters histomorphological changes liver pancreas. Among three doses, 20mg/kgb.w. betanin able positively regulate plasma glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) hemoglobin (Hb) levels significantly increasing activity glycolytic enzyme (glucokinase pyruvate kinase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase significantly decreasing activity gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) thereby increasing glycogen content liver. put forward betanin could significantly restore levels carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes near normal diabetic rat. Immunohistochemical observation pancreas revealed betanin treated diabetic rats showed increased insulin immunoreactive beta-cells, confirmed biochemical findings. Taken together, present study suggests betanin modulates carbohydrate metabolism beneficial effects glucose homeostasis.
