 RATIONALE: Post-ischemic changes cellular metabolism alter myocardial neurological function. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), limiting step mitochondrial glucose oxidation, inhibited increased expression PDH kinase (PDK) ischemia/reperfusion injury. results decreased utilization glucose generate cellular ATP. Post-cardiac arrest (CA) hypothermia improves outcomes alters metabolism, influence PDH PDK activity following CA unknown. hypothesized therapeutic hypothermia (TH) following CA associated inhibition PDK activity increased PDH activity. hypothesized inhibitor PDK activity, dichloroacetate (DCA), would improve PDH activity post-CA outcomes. METHODS RESULTS: Anesthetized ventilated adult female C57BL/6 wild-type mice underwent 12-minute KCl-induced CA followed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Compared normothermic (37 degrees C) CA controls, administering TH (30 degrees C) improved overall survival (72-hour survival rate: 62.5% vs. 28.6%, P<0.001), post-resuscitation myocardial function (ejection fraction: 50.9+/-3.1% vs. 27.2+/-2.0%, P<0.001; aorta systolic pressure: 132.7+/-7.3 vs. 72.3+/-3.0 mmHg, P<0.001), neurological scores 72-hour post CA (9.5+/-1.3 vs. 5.4+/-1.3, P<0.05). heart brain, CA increased lactate concentrations (1.9-fold 3.1-fold increase, respectively, P<0.01), decreased PDH enzyme activity (24% 50% reduction, respectively, P<0.01), increased PDK protein expressions (1.2-fold 1.9-fold, respectively, P<0.01). contrast, post-CA treatment TH normalized lactate concentrations (P<0.01 P<0.05) PDK expressions (P<0.001 P<0.05), increasing PDH activity (P<0.01 P<0.01) heart brain. Additionally, treatment DCA (0.2 mg/g body weight) 30 min prior CA improved myocardial hemodynamics 2 hours post-CA (aortic systolic pressure: 123+/-3 vs. 96+/-4 mmHg, P<0.001) 72-hour survival rates (50% vs. 19%, P<0.05) normothermic animals. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced PDH activity setting TH DCA administration associated improved post-CA resuscitation outcomes. PDH promising therapeutic target improving post-CA outcomes.
