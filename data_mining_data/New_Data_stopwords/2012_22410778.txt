 Warburg effect cancer cells proposed involve several mechanisms, including adaptation hypoxia, oncogenes activation loss oncosuppressors impaired mitochondrial function. previous papers, shown K-ras transformed mouse cells much sensitive compared normal cells glucose withdrawal (undergoing apoptosis) present high glycolytic rate strong reduction mitochondrial complex I. Recent observations suggest transformed cells derangement cyclic adenosine monophosphate/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP/PKA) pathway, known regulate several mitochondrial functions. Herein, derangement cAMP/PKA pathway impact transformation-linked changes mitochondrial functions investigated. Exogenous stimulation PKA activity, achieved forskolin treatment, protected K-ras-transformed cells apoptosis induced glucose deprivation, enhanced complex activity, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, mitochondrial fusion decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Several effects almost completely prevented inhibiting PKA activity. Short-time treatment compounds favoring mitochondrial fusion strongly decreased cellular ROS levels especially transformed cells. findings support notion glucose shortage-induced apoptosis, specific K-ras-transformed cells, associated derangement PKA signaling leads mitochondrial complex decrease, reduction ATP formation, prevalence mitochondrial fission fusion, thereby opening new approaches development anticancer drugs.
