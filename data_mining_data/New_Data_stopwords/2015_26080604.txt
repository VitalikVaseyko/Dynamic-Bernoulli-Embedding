 BACKGROUND: prognosis pancreatic cancer remains desperately poor, little progress made past 30 years despite development new combination chemotherapy regimens. Stromal activity especially prominent tissue surrounding pancreatic tumours, profound influence dictating tumour development dissemination. Pancreatic stellate cells (PaSCs) key role tumour microenvironment, subject much research past decade. review examines relationship PaSCs cancer cells. METHODS: comprehensive literature search performed multiple databases March 2014, including Medline, Pubmed Google Scholar. RESULTS: complex bidirectional interplay exists PaSCs cancer cells, resulting perpetuating loop increased activity overriding pro-tumorigenic effect. involves number signalling pathways also impacts stromal components vasculature, contributing chemoresistance. Reverse Warburg Effect also introduced novel concept tumour stroma. CONCLUSION: review highlights pancreatic tumour microenvironment, particular PaSCs, ideal target therapeutics. number cellular processes involving PaSCs could hold key effectively treating pancreatic cancer. feasibility targeting pathways warrant depth investigation, aim reducing aggressiveness pancreatic cancer improving chemodelivery.
