 AIMS: Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5) two metabolic oncogenic markers cancer. study, sought investigate expression patterns prognostic value tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). METHODS RESULTS: expression subcellular localization PKM2 LDH5 TSCC cell lines determined Western blot immunofluorescence. PKM2 LDH5 abundance examined immunohistochemistry 63 TSCC tumour specimens; association multiple clinicopathological parameters overall patient survival assessed. protein levels PKM2 LDH5 significantly higher TSCC cells immortalized oral epithelial cell line. Overexpression PKM2 associated significantly cervical node metastasis (P = 0.0373), elevated LDH5 levels correlated significantly tumour size (P = 0.0094), pathological grade (P = 0.0052), cervical node metastasis (P = 0.0023) clinical stage (P = 0.0024). Patients tumours showing increase either PKM2 LDH5 expression displayed significantly reduced overall survival, patients tumours overexpressing proteins showed worst prognosis lowest overall survival. Furthermore, PKM2 LDH5 identified independent prognostic predictors overall patient survival TSCC. CONCLUSION: data indicate overexpression PKM2 LDH5 associates key clinicopathological features unfavourable prognosis TSCC.
