 MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), highly abundant liver-specific miRNA, acts tumor suppressor hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Decreased expression miR-122 HCC frequently observed associated poor differentiation, larger tumor size, metastasis invasion, poor prognosis. Mutant mice knockout (KO) miR-122 locus developed steatohepatitis due increased triglyceride (TG) synthesis decreased TG secretion hepatocytes, eventually developed HCC. Exogenic miR-122 introduction miR-122 KO mice inhibited development HCC. Target genes miR-122, including cyclin G1, disintegrin metalloprotease (ADAM)10, serum response factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, ADAM17, transcription factor CUTL1, embryonic isoform pyruvate kinase (Pkm2), Wnt1, pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 binding factor, Cut-like homeobox 1, c-myc, involved hepatocarcinogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis. MiR-122 expression regulated liver-enriched transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha, HNF3beta, HNF4alpha, HNF6, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha. positive feedback loop exists C/EBPalpha miR-122 HNF6 miR-122, whereas negative feedback loop exists c-myc miR-122. Since cotreatment 5-Aza-Cd histone deacetylase inhibitor restored miR-122 expression HCC cells, epigenetic modulation miR-122 expression involved suppression miR-122 HCC. Several experiments suggest increasing miR-122 levels HCC without antitumor agents may promising strategy HCC treatment.
