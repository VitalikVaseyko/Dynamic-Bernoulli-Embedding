 hierarchical classification chemical scaffolds (molecular framework, obtained pruning terminal side chains) introduced. molecular frameworks form leaf nodes hierarchy trees. iterative removal rings, scaffolds forming higher levels hierarchy tree obtained. Prioritization rules ensure less characteristic, peripheral rings removed first. scaffolds hierarchy tree well-defined chemical entities making classification chemically intuitive. classification deterministic, data-set-independent, scales linearly number compounds included data set. application classification demonstrated two data sets extracted PubChem database, namely, pyruvate kinase binders collection pesticides. examples shown demonstrate classification procedure handles robustly synthetic structures natural products.
