 OBJECTIVES: Aerobic glycolysis, main pathway energy production tumors (Warburg effect) allows detection tumors positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG). Since ionizing radiation (IR) reported switch aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, radiotherapeutic efficacy monitored activity mitochondrial complex (MC-I), using new PET probe 18F-BCPP-EF, 18F-2-tert-butyl-4-chloro-5-{6-[2-(2-fluoro-ethoxy)-ethoxy] -pyridine-3-ylmethoxy}-2H-pyridazin-3-one, compared 18F-FDG uptake apoptosis index. METHODS: Tumor uptake 18F-BCPP-EF 18F-FDG examined C3H/HeN mice inoculated murine squamous cell carcinoma SCCVII various time points single dose x-ray irradiation 0, 6, 15, 30 Gy. Apoptosis incidence determined TUNEL staining excised tumor tissue. RESULTS: Tumor growth suppression dose-dependent; tumor grew 10-fold (0 Gy), 5-fold (6 Gy), 2-fold (15 Gy), reduced half volume (30 Gy) 14 days treatment. 18F-BCPP-EF uptake significantly increased early 3 days 15 Gy 30 Gy, tumor size apoptosis index showed difference among radiation doses. contrast, 18F-FDG uptake initially increased dose-dependently, remained elevated 7 days, eventually decreased 10 days 30 Gy also 14 days 15 Gy tumor size already reduced. Apoptosis index increased irradiation failed correlate tumor response. CONCLUSION: Tumor uptake 18F-BCPP-EF increased dose-dependently early effective doses IR 18F-FDG uptake well apoptosis incidence indicative tumor response. results suggest 18F-BCPP-EF promising "positive" MC-I imaging PET probe early detection efficacy tumor radiotherapy.
