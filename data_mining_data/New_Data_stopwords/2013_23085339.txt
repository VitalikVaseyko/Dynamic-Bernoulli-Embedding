 Rosmarinus officinalis (R. officinalis), culinary aromatic medicinal plant, rich polyphenols flavonoids high antioxidant properties. plant reported exert multiple benefits neuronal system alleviate mood disorder. previous study, demonstrated R. officinalis active compounds, luteolin (Lut), carnosic acid (CA), rosmarinic acid (RA), exhibited neurotrophic effects improved cholinergic functions PC12 cells correlation mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK1/2 signaling pathway. current study conducted evaluate understand anti-depressant effect R. officinalis using tail suspension test (TST) ICR mice PC12 cells vitro neuronal model. Proteomics analysis PC12 cells treated R. officinalis polyphenols (ROP) Lut, CA, RA revealed significant upregulation tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) pyruvate carboxylase (PC) two major genes involved dopaminergic, serotonergic GABAergic pathway regulations. Moreover, ROP demonstrated protect neuronal cells corticosterone-induced toxicity. results concordant decreasing immobility time TST regulation several neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin acetylcholine) gene expression mice brain like TH, PC MAPK phosphatase (MKP-1). best knowledge first evidence contribute understanding molecular mechanism behind anti-depressant effect R. officinalis major active compounds.
