 downstream signaling components high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) studied using yeast two-hybrid screening cDNA library constructed RBL-2H3 cells. cytoplasmic part gamma-chain beta-chain found interact pyruvate kinase yeast. in-vitro-translated pyruvate kinase also specifically interacted bacterially expressed glutathione-S transferase fusion protein cytoplasmic part gamma-chain. RBL-2H3 cells challenged antigen, activity pyruvate kinase gradually decreased, reaching minimum activity around 5 min activation, slowly returned normal level. dose-response curve (antigen vs. pyruvate kinase activity) plotted 5 min stimulation showed pyruvate kinase dose-dependently inhibited maximum inhibition reached concentration 0.1 microgram/ml antigen. Direct interaction FcepsilonRI pyruvate kinase also demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation RBL-2H3 cells. data suggest pyruvate kinase functionally linked FcepsilonRI might exert important role controlling cellular functions following activation FcepsilonRI.
