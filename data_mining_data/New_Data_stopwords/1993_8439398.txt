 Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate incorporation pyruvate kinase II E. coli decreased substrate phosphoenolpyruvate increased allosteric activator ribose 5-phosphate, total incorporation linearly related inactivation. Four lysyl residues substantially modified, whatever incubation conditions two additional residues became reactive presence allosteric activator. Six tryptic peptides containing modified lysines purified sequenced. defined five regions pyruvate kinase II, since one contained two labelled lysines included peptide also appeared independently. Sequence comparison E. coli type I, yeast cat muscle pyruvate kinases shows binding regions pyruvate kinase II clearly divergent pyruvate kinase eukaryotic enzymes.
