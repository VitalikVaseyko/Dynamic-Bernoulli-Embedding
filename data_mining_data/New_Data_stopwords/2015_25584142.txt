 Cancer cells known drastically alter cellular energy metabolism. Warburg effect known 80 years pertaining cancer-specific aerobic glycolysis. underlying molecular mechanisms elucidated cancer cells alter cellular energy metabolism advantage, significance modulation metabolic profiles gaining attention. Now, metabolic reprogramming becoming emerging hallmark cancer. Therapeutic agents target cancer energy metabolism intensive investigation, investigations mostly focused cytosolic glycolytic processes. Although mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation integral part cellular energy metabolism, recently, regarded auxiliary cytosolic glycolytic processes cancer energy metabolism. review, discuss importance mitochondrial respiration metabolic reprogramming cancer, addition discussing justification using mitochondrial DNA somatic mutation metabolic determinants cancer sensitivity glucose limitation.
