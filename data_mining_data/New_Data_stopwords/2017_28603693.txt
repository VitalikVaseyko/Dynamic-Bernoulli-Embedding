 Following discovery mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) hub lipid metabolism 1990 description one first examples membrane contact sites turn century, past decade seen emergence structure potential regulator cancer growth metabolism. mechanistic basis hypothesis MAM accommodates flux Ca(2+) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mitochondria. flux determines mitochondrial ATP production, known low many tumors part Warburg effect. However, low mitochondrial Ca(2+) flux also reduces propensity tumor cells undergo apoptosis, another cancer hallmark. Numerous regulators flux recently identified MAM proteins. surprisingly, many fall groups tumor suppressors oncogenes. Given important role MAM could play cancer, expected proteins mediating formation particularly implicated tumorigenesis. Examples proteins mitofusin-2 phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 likely act tumor suppressors. review discusses proteins mediate regulate ER-mitochondria tethering (or not) promoting inhibiting tumorigenesis. emerging picture MAMs cancer seems indicate addition downregulation mitochondrial Ca(2+) import, MAM defects one way cancer cells control mitochondria metabolism apoptosis.
