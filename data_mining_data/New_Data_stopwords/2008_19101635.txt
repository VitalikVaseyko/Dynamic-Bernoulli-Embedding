 p53 tumor suppressor plays pivotal role organism supervising strict compliance individual cells needs whole organisms. widely accepted p53 acts response stresses abnormalities cell physiology mobilizing repair processes removing diseased cells initiating cell death programs. Recent studies, however, indicate even normal physiological conditions certain activities p53 participate homeostatic regulation metabolic processes activities important prevention cancer. novel functions p53 help align metabolic processes proliferation energy status, maintain optimal mode glucose metabolism boost energy efficient mitochondrial respiration response ATP deficiency. Additional activities p53 non-stressed cells tune antioxidant defense mechanisms reducing probability mutations caused DNA oxidation conditions daily stresses. deficiency p53-mediated regulation glycolysis mitochondrial respiration greatly accounts deficient respiration predominance aerobic glycolysis cancer cells (the Warburg effect), deficiency p53-modulated antioxidant defense mechanisms contributes mutagenesis additionally boosts carcinogenesis process.
