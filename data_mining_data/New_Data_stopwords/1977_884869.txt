 Allosterism allows individual assay isoenzymes, one abundant muscle, pyruvate kinase (PK), recently reported superior serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) detecting patients female carriers X-linked recessive (Duchenne) muscular dystrophy (DMD). Extensive comparative studies support findings confirmed marked superiority CPK rariants PK enzymes sensitivity, stability convenience. Deducting adenylate kinase increment (AKI) refined CPK assay, eliminating effect haemolysis diagnosis enabling studies blood cell content. leucocytes erythrocytes liberated PK lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) brief chilling disruption. erythrocytes showed CPK content, however, constantly adjusted match serum free cell membrane passage, less accomodating sudden large influx CPK LDH, apparent buffering effect could account differences clinical response.
