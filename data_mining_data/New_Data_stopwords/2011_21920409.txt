 BACKGROUND: months-to-years primary cancer progress advanced phenotype metastatic resistant clinical treatments. early 1900s, discovered progression cancer advanced phenotype often associated shift metabolic profile disease state respiration anaerobic fermentation - phenomenon denoted Warburg Effect. SCOPE REVIEW: Reports literature strongly suggest Warburg Effect generated response loss integrity sequence and/or copy number mitochondrial genome content within cancer. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Multiple studies regarding progression cancer indicate mutation, and/or, flux copy number, mitochondrial genome content support early development cancer, until; mutational load and/or reduction-to-depletion copy number mitochondrial genome content induces progression disease advanced phenotype. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, evidence revealed human cell incorporated mitochondrial genome content cellular mechanism that, pathologically actuated, de(un)differentiate cancer parental tissue origin autonomous disease disrupts hierarchical structure-and-function human body. article part Special Issue entitled: Biochemistry Mitochondria.
