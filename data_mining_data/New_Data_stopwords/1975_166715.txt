 Three models disturbed erythrocyte metabolism, triose-depleted normal, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)-deficient, pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient cells, studied examine role PGK erythrocyte cation transport. Sodium (Na-+) potassium (K-+) transport reduced cells fully depleted triose. cells PGK step presumably inoperative due total lack substrate; 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) became sole substrate source remaining steps glycolysis. increased intracellular Na-+ concentrations normally stimulate transport glycolysis, triose-depleted cells marked impairment cation transport ouabain-inhibitable lactate pyruvate production 2,3-DPG. PGK-deficient cells normal cells high intracellular Na-+ concentrations similar increases transport ouabain-inhibitable lactate production. PK-deficient cells high intracellular Na-+ concentrations showed appropriate increase transport less stimulation lactate production. Transport related total cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. data suggested normal coupled cation transport occurred despite diminished metabolite flow PGK, PGK- PK-deficient cells. Transport diminished triose-depleted cells metabolite flow PGK presumably absent. data, therefore, support concept transport glycolysis interact PGK step, although impairment PGK must profound effect transport evident.
