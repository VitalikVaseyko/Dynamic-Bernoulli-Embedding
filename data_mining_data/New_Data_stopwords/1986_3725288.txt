 Anthracycline antibiotics among active agents currently available treatment solid tumors. use limited development severe cardiomyopathy. makes necessary subject new anticancer agents laboratory clinical tests order determine capacity damage cardiac cells. Mitoxantrone anthracenedione derivative structural functional similarities doxorubicin. Comparative trials rat suggest mitoxantrone induced cardiac toxicity might less marked caused doxorubicin, clinical studies report significant incidence cardiac failure following mitoxantrone administration. present study undertaken evaluate (in vitro) effect increasing concentrations mitoxantrone respiratory control, measuring oxygen uptake rat heart slices Warburg manometric apparatus. period 60 min, cellular endogenous respiration progressively inhibited increasing mitoxantrone concentration (from 5 20 microM). date show rate oxygen uptake levels time concentrations except lowest (5 microM) control. Oxygen uptake values range 2.87 1.41 microliter/mg dry weight differ significantly compared controls (p less 0.01). values oxygen uptake 0 20 min show linear correlation approached date group consider exponential relation (i.e., log slope versus dose), linear correlation coefficient somewhat improved (r = -0.939). results indicate mitoxantrone, manner analogous doxorubicin, inhibits cellular respiration impairs cardiac respiratory control. impairment probably one aspects cellular damage leading cardiac failure. Moreover, recent study observed pathological lesions induced doxorubicin heart rats treated mitoxantrone.
