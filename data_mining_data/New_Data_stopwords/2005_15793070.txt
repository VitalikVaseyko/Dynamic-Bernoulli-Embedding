 Storage protein synthesis dependent available nitrogen seed, may controlled amino acid import via specific transporters. analyze rate-limiting role seed protein synthesis, Vicia faba amino acid permease, VfAAP1, ectopically expressed pea (Pisum sativum) Vicia narbonensis seeds control legumin B4 promoter. mature seeds, starch unchanged total nitrogen 10% 25% higher, affects mainly globulin, vicilin, legumin, rather albumin synthesis. Transgenic seeds vitro take [14C]-glutamine, indicating increased sink strength amino acids. addition, [14C] partitioned proteins. Levels total free amino acids growing seeds unchanged shift toward higher relative abundance asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, glutamate. Hexoses decreased, whereas metabolites glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle unchanged slightly lower. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase-to-pyruvate kinase ratios higher seeds one three lines, indicating increased anaplerotic fluxes. Increases individual seed size 20% 30% vegetative biomass indicate growth responses probably due improved nitrogen status. However, seed yield per plant altered. Root application [15N] ammonia results significantly higher label transgenic seeds, well stems pods, indicates stimulation nitrogen root uptake. summary, VfAAP1 expression increases seed sink strength nitrogen, improves plant nitrogen status, leads higher seed protein. conclude seed protein synthesis nitrogen limited seed uptake activity nitrogen rate limiting storage protein synthesis.
