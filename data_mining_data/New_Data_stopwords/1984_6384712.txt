 Insulin action [32P]-phosphate incorporation brain membranes determined. Hippocampal homogenate tissue phosphorylated [32P]-ATP, insulin introduced various times ATP addition. 50 microM Mg++ medium, insulin selectively stimulated phosphorylation 47kD phosphoprotein, Protein F1. effect required prior presence ATP. effect insulin phosphoproteins, [32P]-phosphate incorporation TCA-precipitated material, observed conditions. 1 mM Mg++, insulin selectively decreased phosphorylation alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase. Insulin effect phosphoproteins, [32P]-phosphate incorporation TCA-precipitated material conditions. present study suggests role insulin modulation brain protein phosphorylation. Since Protein F1 phosphorylated exogenous C kinase, likely CNS-specific B-50 protein, data also indicate brain-specific function insulin, possibly action Ca++/phospholipid protein kinase.
