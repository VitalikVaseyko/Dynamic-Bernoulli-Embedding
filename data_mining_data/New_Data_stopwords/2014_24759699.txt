 Fecal concentrations pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (M2-PK) calprotectin (FC) serve biomarkers inflammation gastrointestinal mucosa. value M2-PK discriminating patients viral bacterial acute diarrhea (AD) currently unknown. analyzed M2-PK FC concentrations fifty hospitalized children AD (29 caused rotavirus 21 Salmonella enteritidis) well 32 healthy subjects. difference areas receiver operating characteristic curves plotted two tests differentiating rotaviral bacterial AD. sensitivity specificity M2-PK optimal cut-off (20 U/g) 75.9% 71.4%, respectively. M2-PK FC similar values distinguishing children AD caused rotavirus Salmonella enteritidis. performance tests hospitalized patients meet needs everyday clinical practice. Moreover, advantage fecal tests measurement CRP documented.
