 Cancer envisioned metabolic disease driven pressure selection intercellular cooperativeness. Together anaerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, formally corresponding uncoupling glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation, directly participates cancer aggressiveness, supporting tumor progression dissemination. transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) key contributor glycolysis. stimulates expression glycolytic transporters enzymes supporting high rate glycolysis. study, addressed reverse possibility metabolic control HIF-1 tumor cells. report lactate, end-product glycolysis, inhibits prolylhydroxylase 2 activity activates HIF-1 normoxic oxidative tumor cells Warburg-phenotype tumor cells also expressed lower basal levels HIF-1alpha. data confirmed using genotypically matched oxidative mitochondria-depleted glycolytic tumor cells well several different wild-type human tumor cell lines either metabolic phenotype. Lactate activates HIF-1 triggers tumor angiogenesis tumor growth vivo, activity found specific upstream control lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expressed tumor cells. MCT1 also gates lactate-fueled tumor cell respiration mediates pro-angiogenic lactate signaling endothelial cells, MCT1 inhibition confirmed attractive anticancer strategy single drug may target multiple tumor-promoting pathways.
