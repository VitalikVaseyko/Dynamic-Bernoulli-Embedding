 present study examines pyruvate kinase-conjugated antibodies potential use ELISA applications. conjugates acceptable stability, coupling inflicted minor impairment kinase activity. mimic setup immunoassay development, test antigen (BSA) attached polystyrene nanoparticles. arrangement found suitable solid support presentation antigens sensitive bioluminescence assays. nanoparticles well characterized terms protein surface load used establish number conjugate complexes needed generate detectable signal. biochemical conditions employed here, detection limit pyruvate kinase conjugate lies femtomole range.
