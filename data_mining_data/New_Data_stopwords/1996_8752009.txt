 phylogeny substitution rates mammalian X chromosome-located autosomal phosphoglycerate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase genes investigated. Compatibility analysis used show reticulate evolution genes. Analysis marsupial, mouse, human phosphoglycerate kinase genes suggests least two recombination events taken place, one occurring time placental-marsupial split involving exons 1-5 primate-rodent split involving exons 9-10. Similar analysis pyruvate dehydrogenase genes indicates recombination event involving exons 2-3 time primate-rodent split gene conversion exons 3-4 human somatic testis-specific pyruvate dehydrogenase genes primate-rodent split. demonstrates genetic exchange occur paralogous genes widely separated chromosomal locations. Estimation nucleotide substitution rates genes confirmed higher substitution rate pyruvate dehydrogenase genes. phosphoglycerate kinase genes, difference substitution rates mice humans X chromosome- autosome-located genes. greater substitution rate noted mouse autosomal pyruvate dehydrogenase gene compared mouse human genes. may result either directional natural selection relaxation functional constraint specific gene.
