 BACKGROUND PURPOSE: EGFR translocated cell nucleus response irradiation, involved regulation radio-sensitivity. aim study elucidate functional role nuclear EGFR. MATERIAL METHODS: identify EGFR-bound nuclear proteins mRNAs, Maldi-TOF analysis mRNA gene arrays used. Complex formation proteins shown confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation Western blotting. effect EGFR binding mRNAs exhibited quantitative RT-PCR. Cellular endpoints shown Western blotting, mitochondrial mass quantification, lactate quantification clonogenic survival assays. RESULTS: Maldi-TOF analysis proteins bound nuclear EGFR response irradiation showed colocalization Lamin heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Confocal microscopy Western blotting confirmed colocalization. Lamin heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins involved mRNA processing. support role nEGFR context irradiation, isolated EGFR-bound mRNA observed EGFR kinase-dependent mRNA stabilizing effect. help DNA microarrays, identified mRNAs associated Warburg effect bound nuclear EGFR. context, observed radiation-induced HIF1alpha expression, triggers inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase blocks tricarboxylic acid cycle. Consequently, detected mitophagy increased lactate production, associated increased treatment resistance. Reduction nEGFR decreased radiation-induced expression Hif1alpha lactate production. CONCLUSIONS: showed nuclear EGFR selectively binds stabilizes mRNA involved Warburg effect response irradiation. consequence, cells switch aerobic anaerobic glucose metabolism, prevented HIF1alpha inhibitor BAY87-2243, Dasatinib, Erlotinib EGFR siRNA.
