 High glycolysis, well known "Warburg effect," frequently observed variety cancers. Whether deregulation miRNAs contributes Warburg effect remains largely unknown. miRNA regulates gene expression mRNA protein levels, constructed gene functional association network, allows us detect gene activity instead gene expression, integratively analyze microarray data gene expression miRNA expression profiling identify glycolysis-related gene-miRNA pairs deregulated cancer. Hexokinase 2 (HK2), coding first rate-limiting enzyme glycolysis, among top list genes predicted potentially regulated multiple miRNAs including miR-143. Interestingly, miR-143 expression inversely associated HK2 protein level mRNA level human lung cancer samples. miR-143, down-regulated mammalian target rapamycin activation, reduces glucose metabolism inhibits cancer cell proliferation tumor formation targeting HK2. Collectively, established novel methodology gene-miRNA pair prediction also identified miR-143 essential regulator cancer glycolysis via targeting HK2.
