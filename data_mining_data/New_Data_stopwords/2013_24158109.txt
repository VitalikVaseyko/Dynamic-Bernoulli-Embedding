 BACKGROUND: Anti-angiogenic treatment glioblastoma characteristically results therapy resistance tumor progression via diffuse infiltration. Monitoring tumor progression patients thwarted therapy results tumor invisibility contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI. address problem, examined whether tumor progression could monitored metabolic mapping using (1)H MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). METHODS: treated groups BALB/c nu/nu mice carrying different orthotopic diffuse-infiltrative glioblastoma xenografts bevacizumab (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] antibody, n = 13), cabozantinib (combined VEGF receptor 2/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, n = 11), placebo (n = 15) compared CE-MRI MRS-derived metabolic maps before, during, treatment. Metabolic maps CE-MRIs subsequently correlated histology immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: vivo imaging choline/n-acetyl aspartate ratios via multivoxel MRS better able evaluate response therapy CE-MRI. Lactate imaging revealed diffuse infiltrative areas glioblastoma xenografts present excessive glycolysis. contrast, glycolysis observed hypoxic areas angiogenesis-dependent compact regions glioma only, especially anti-angiogenic treatment. CONCLUSION: data present MRSI powerful feasible approach superior CE-MRI may provide handles optimizing treatment glioma. Furthermore, show glycolysis prominent hypoxic areas areas diffuse infiltrative growth. Warburg hypothesis persisting glycolysis tumors normoxic conditions may thus valid diffuse glioma.
