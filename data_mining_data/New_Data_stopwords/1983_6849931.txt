 coupled system two enzyme-catalysed reactions concentration final product follows sigmoidal progress curve. shape curve dependent concentrations kinetic properties enzymes system; provided activities two enzymes similar, kinetic properties enzymes may determined simultaneously analysis curves. value approach substantiated using model system consisting pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). Analysis data combination numerical integration nonlinear regression yielded values kinetic parameters excellent agreement determined measurements steady-state rates. Appropriate experimental designs type progress curve analysis considered. analysis compared with, shown much greater generality than, published procedures involving measurements early stages progress curves.
