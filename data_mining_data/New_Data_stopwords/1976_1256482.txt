 Salicylate known uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Since viability pyruvate-kinase-deficient reticulocytes depends ATP generated mitochondrial metabolism, study examined effects salicylate erythrocytes deficient pyruvate kinase. deficient erythrocytes patients severe hemolysis incubated salicylate (2 30 mg per deciliter), marked decrease (25 75 percent) ATP. addition, drug-induced ATP depletion produced cell potassium water loss, normal oxidant responsiveness hexose-monophosphate shunt blunted. Since cellular abnormalities associated accelerated hemolysis vivo, data suggest aspirin therapy may aggravate hemolysis patients pyruvate kinase deficiency whose erythrocyte manifest sensitivity salicylate vitro.
