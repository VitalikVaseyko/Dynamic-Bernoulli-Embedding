 Two double-stranded cDNA recombinant pBR322 plasmid libraries constructed starting high carbohydrate diet rat liver poly(A)+ mRNA, either fractionated denaturing sucrose gradient centrifugation cloning L-type pyruvate kinase cDNA, nonfractionated aldolase B. libraries screened single-stranded cDNA probes reverse transcribed fasted high carbohydrate diet rat liver mRNAs. mRNAs fasted animals also fractionated sucrose gradient centrifugation mRNAs fed animals were, addition, purified high performance liquid gel filtration chromatography. clones hybridizing "positive" probe (from animals fed high carbohydrate diet) "negative" one (from fasted animals) preselected plasmid DNA purified analyzed positive hybridization-selection. Thirty 4500 bacteria colonies transformed recombinant plasmids preselected differential screening pyruvate kinase, 8 864 colonies aldolase B. Twenty-two recombinant plasmids pyruvate kinase two aldolase B shown contain specific cDNA inserts positive hybridization-selection. Plasmids DNAs pyruvate kinase aldolase B clones (whose inserts ranged 700 1050 bases length) labeled nick translation used probes Northern blot hybridization. pyruvate kinase cDNA probes recognized mainly 3400-base RNA species detected high carbohydrate diet rat liver, fasted rat liver tissues synthesize L-type pyruvate kinase. addition, pyruvate kinase probes hybridized minor RNA species 2000 bases length, observed carbohydrate diet. aldolase B, recombinant plasmid DNA hybridized single RNA species 1750 bases. RNA, detected kidney, small intestine liver, induced high carbohydrate diet increased liver development. rat probe cross-hybridized human aldolase B messenger RNA.
