 Eight enzymes, e.g. lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, fructose-diphosphate aldolase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase estimated quantitatively rat lens 37 1,211 days age, spectrophotometric methods. activity expressed mU/g LWW. enzymes measured showed declining activities, LDH, ALD, SDH, G-6-PDH, HK PFK gave significant decrease ageing plotted semi-logarithmically 37 1,211 days. SDH G-6-PDH showed statistically significant difference enzymes male female lenses. female lens always lower activity male lens. enzymes specific activity, expressed mU/l mg protein, calculated. specific activity appeared rather constant ageing, except ALD. female lenses, specific activity 7 enzymes lower male lenses. ALD specific activity decreased significantly male lens 5.32 37 days 0.88 1,211 days. female lens significant decrease 4.97 0.81.
