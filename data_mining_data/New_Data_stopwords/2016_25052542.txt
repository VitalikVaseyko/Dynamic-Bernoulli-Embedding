 PURPOSE: study conducted investigate whether aspartate (Asp) could improve liver energy status lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged pigs. METHODS: Twenty-four weaned pigs assigned four treatments: (1) nonchallenged control (control diet saline-treated); (2) LPS-challenged control (the control diet LPS-challenged); (3) LPS + 0.5% Asp treatment (0.5% Asp diet LPS-challenged); (4) LPS + 1.0% Asp treatment (a 1.0% Asp diet LPS-challenged). 19, pigs injected intraperitoneally Escherichia coli LPS 100 mug/kg body weight, volume 0.9% NaCl solution, respectively. pigs slaughtered 24 h LPS saline injection, liver collected analysis. RESULTS: Dietary supplementation Asp improved liver energy status evidenced increased ATP concentration adenylate energy charges, decreased AMP concentration AMP/ATP ratio (p < 0.05). Asp supplementation increased mRNA expression key enzymes hepatic glycolysis tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, including pyruvate kinase citrate synthase (p < 0.05), tendency increase hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase isocitrate dehydrogenase beta mRNA expression (p < 0.10). addition, Asp increased mRNA expressions hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha1, AMPKalpha2, silent information regulator (Sirt1), proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) (p < 0.05). Moreover, Asp increased AMPKalpha phosphorylation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: results indicated dietary supplementation Asp could improve energy status LPS-injured liver, might result motivating metabolism pathway TCA cycle glycolysis stimulating AMPK signaling pathway.
