 Increased glucose flux generates metabolic signals control transcriptional programs poorly understood mechanisms. Previously, demonstrated necessity hepatocytes c-Myc regulation prototypical glucose-responsive gene, L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) (Collier JJ, Doan TT, Daniels MC, Schurr JR, Kolls JK, Scott DK. J Biol Chem 278: 6588-6595, 2003). Pancreatic beta-cells many features common hepatocytes respect glucose-regulated gene expression, present study determined whether c-Myc required L-PK glucose response insulin-secreting (INS-1)-derived 832/13 cells. Glucose increased c-Myc abundance association heterodimer partner, Max. Manipulations prevented formation functional c-Myc/Max heterodimer reduced expression L-PK gene. addition, glucose augmented binding carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), c-Myc, Max promoter L-PK gene situ. transactivation ChREBP, c-Myc, dependent high glucose concentrations contexts either L-PK promoter heterologous promoter. glucose-mediated transactivation ChREBP independent mutations alter phosphorylation sites thought regulate cellular location ChREBP. conclude maximal glucose-induced expression L-PK gene INS-1-derived 832/13 cells involves increased c-Myc abundance, recruitment c-Myc, Max, ChREBP promoter, glucose-stimulated increase ChREBP transactivation.
