 Lysophosphatidylcholine major lysophospholipid mammalian tissues shown cytolytic high concentrations. present study demonstrated level lysophosphatidylcholine significantly increased heart rats fed vitamin E-deficient diet. Moreover, cardiac lysophosphatidylcholine level decreased rats fed high vitamin E diet. alterations cardiac lysophosphatidylcholine level dietary vitamin E attributed changes activity cardiac phospholipase A. Dietary vitamin E affected phospholipase A1 A2 manner, effect major enzymes responsible metabolism lysophosphatidylcholine. Kinetic studies revealed inhibition enzyme activity vitamin E essentially non-competitive. accumulation lysophosphatidylcholine rat heart may one underlying biochemical causes observed cardiac dysfunctions produced vitamin E deficiency.
