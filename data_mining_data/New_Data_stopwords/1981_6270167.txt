 Metabolic studies tumor cells indicated bioenergetic regulatory mechanisms geared acute changes oxygen availability abnormal. present studies examined bioenergetic adaptations chronic oxygen depletion culture maintained tumor cells comparison normal cell lines. Activities two key glycolytic enzymes (pyruvate kinase (PyKI) phosphofructokinase (PFK)) measured two tumor cell lines (fibrosarcoma (FS) Hela) two normal cell lines (rat lung fibroblasts (RLF) WI-38) maintained culture 96 hours aerobic (PO2 approximately 140) hypoxic PO2 approximately 15) conditions. Exposure low O2 tensions 96 hours resulted significant increases PyKi PFK RLF WI-38, ut alter activities enzymes either FS HeLa cell systems. Activities two enzymes involved O2 metabolism (cytochrome oxidase (CyOx) superoxide dismutase (SOD) also measured two tumor cell lines RLF. chronic hypoxia significantly decreased activities CyOx SOD RLF cell systems alter activities enzymes tumor cells. studies, tumor-derived cell lines demonstrate specific enzymatic responses sustained oxygen depletion vitro noted normal cell systems, suggesting significant abnormalities regulatory mechanisms geared chronic changes molecular O2.
