 Proliferating cells, particular tumor cells, express dimeric isoenzyme pyruvate kinase, termed Tumor M2 pyruvate kinase. last years, much attention paid novel tumor marker determined EDTA-plasma feces. used diagnosis surveillance variety malignant diseases. compared established tumor markers, Tumor M2-PK EDTA-plasma proves least equal sensitivity pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, colorectal cholangiocellular cancer. combination established tumor markers, EDTA-plasma M2-PK useful tool diagnosis surveillance gastrointestinal tumors. colorectal cancer, M2-PK EDTA-plasma even proves superiority compared CEA. Fecal Tumor M2-PK testing resembles good noninvasive screening parameter colorectal cancer reported sensitivity 68.8-91.0% specificity 71.9-100%. superior fecal occult blood testing colorectal cancer screening. Since effective, easy handle bears rather low costs, fecal Tumor M2-PK testing recommended large-scale CRC screening.
