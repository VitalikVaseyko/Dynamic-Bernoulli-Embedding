 pathogenesis two metabolic disorders caused enzyme defects red blood cell leading hemolytic anemia, cases glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency additionally neurological impairment investigated. Rheological studies performed determine influence shortage energy deformability erythrocytes. functions enzymes determined studying enzyme kinetics, temperature dependence enzyme activity migration proteins electric field. detailed molecular genetic analysis gene encoding given protein allowed detection mutations involving amino acid exchanges cause alterations protein structure. enzyme deficiencies, good correlation found structural changes (usually caused single point mutations gene), altered function enzymes severity clinical picture. exchange amino acids close either active site regulatory domain results decreased turnover well alteration regulatory properties enzymes; usually leads increased severity disease. Increased concentrations glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), found red blood cells patients suffering hemolytic anemia caused pyruvate kinase (PK) GPI deficiency, correlate well severity clinical picture, apparently reflecting degree perturbation glycolysis. results lack energy donor adenosine triphosphate (ATP); leads destabilization red cell membrane causes earlier lysis red blood cell, turn gives rise hemolytic anemia variable degrees. One patient neurological symptoms studied far biochemically molecular genetic level. point mutations found patient's GPI gene support idea GPI may neurological function addition role carbohydrate metabolism; due presence monomeric sequence analogue called neuroleukin (NLK). mutations apparently lead incorrect folding neurotrophic factor, thus destroy neurological activity.
