 c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulate glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos) although often different purposes. Myc over-expression depletes ATP resultant activation AMPK, explored potential co-dependency cross-talk proteins comparing consequences acute Myc induction ampk+/+ (WT) ampk-/- (KO) murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). KO MEFs showed higher basal rate glycolysis WT MEFs appropriate increase response activation Myc-estrogen receptor (MycER) fusion protein. However, KO MEFs diminished ability increase Oxphos, mitochondrial mass reactive oxygen species response MycER activation. differences WT KO MEFs, either basal state following MycER induction, included abnormalities electron transport chain function, levels TCA cycle-related oxidoreductases cytoplasmic mitochondrial redox states. Transcriptional profiling pathways pertinent glycolysis, Oxphos mitochondrial structure function also uncovered significant differences WT KO MEFs response MycER activation. Finally, unbiased mass-spectrometry (MS)-based survey capable quantifying ~40% mitochondrial proteins, showed 15% AMPK- and/or Myc-dependent steady state. Significant differences activities rate-limiting enzymes pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase, dictate pyruvate acetyl coenzyme abundance, also differentially responsive Myc AMPK could account differences basal metabolite levels also detected MS. Thus, Myc AMPK highly co-dependent appear engage significant cross-talk across numerous pathways support metabolic ATP-generating functions.
