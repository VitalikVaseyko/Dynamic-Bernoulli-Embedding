 previously reported tumor mitochondrial redox state heterogeneity distinguished aggressive indolent breast cancer xenografts, suggesting novel metabolic indices biomarkers predicting tumor metastatic potential. Additionally, reported identified redox biomarkers successfully differentiated normal breast tissue cancerous breast tissue breast cancer patients. aim present study characterize intratumor heterogeneity distribution mitochondrial redox state glucose uptake pattern tumor xenografts investigate metabolic heterogeneity clinical biopsy samples. employed Chance redox scanner, multi-section cryogenic fluorescence imager simultaneously image intratumor heterogeneity mitochondrial redox state glucose uptake high spatial resolution (down 50 x 50 x 20 mum(3)). mitochondrial redox state determined ratio intrinsic fluorescence signals reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidized flavoproteins (Fp including FAD, i.e., flavin adenine dinucleotide), glucose uptake measured using near-infrared fluorescent glucose-analogue, pyropheophorbide 2-deoxyglucosamide (Pyro-2DG). Significant inter- intratumor metabolic heterogeneity observed imaging data various types breast cancer xenografts. patterns degrees heterogeneity mitochondrial redox state appeared relate tumor size metastatic potential. glucose uptake also heterogeneous generally higher tumor peripheries. oxidized reduced regions mostly corresponded lower higher pyro-2DG uptake, respectively. However, regions glucose uptake correlate redox indices. Pronounced glucose uptake high NADH observed certain localized areas within tumor necrotic regions, indicative existence viable cells also supported H&E staining. Significant heterogeneity redox state indices also observed clinical specimens breast cancer patients. abnormal metabolism including Warburg effect (high glycolysis) plays important roles cancer transformation progression, observations reveal 3D intratumor metabolic heterogeneity characteristic feature breast tumors great importance understanding cancer biology developing diagnostic therapeutic methods.
