 Hypoxic tumor microenvironment (HTM) considered promote metabolic changes, oncogene activation epithelial mesenchymal transition, resistance chemo- radio-therapy, hallmarks aggressive tumor behavior. Cancer cells within HTM acquire phenotypic properties allow overcome lack energy nutrients supply within niche. phenotypic properties include activation genes regulating glycolysis, glucose transport, acidosis regulators, angiogenesis, orchestrated activation transcription factor, HIF1A, independent marker poor prognosis. Moreover, adaptation HTM cancer cells undergo deep changes mitochondrial functions "Warburg effect" "reverse Warburg effect".This review aims provide overview characteristics HTM, particular focus novel therapeutic strategies currently clinical trials, targeting adaptive response hypoxia cancer cells.
