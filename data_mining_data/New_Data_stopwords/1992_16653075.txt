 Light-dependent inactivation mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC) pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves characterized, phenomenon extended several monocot dicot species. light-dependent inactivation mtPDC vivo rapidly reversed dark, even prolonged illumination. mtPDC efficiently cycled inactivated-reactivated status rapid light-dark cycling. Light-dependent inactivation mtPDC shown suppressed inhibitors photorespiratory carbon metabolism, including 2-pyridylhydroxymethane sulfonate, isonicotinic acid hydrazide, aminoacetonitrile, inhibitor photosynthesis, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. Glycine fed pea leaf strips dark yielded partially inactivated leaf mtPDC, inactivation blocked inhibitors glycine oxidation. concluded photorespiratory glycine serine conversion occurs C(3) leaf mitochondria provide NADH drive oxidative phosphorylation subsequent inactivation mtPDC. Glycine oxidation also produces ammonium ion, shown enhance inactivation mtPDC vitro stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase catalyzes phosphorylation (inactivation) mtPDC. Thus, light-dependent, photorespiration-stimulated inactivation mtPDC regulate carbon entry Krebs cycle C(3) photosynthesis.
