 Normal tissues express M1 isoform pyruvate kinase (PK) helps generate funnel pyruvate mitochondria ATP production. Tumors, contrast, express less active PKM2 isoform, limits pyruvate production spares glycolytic intermediates generation macromolecules needed proliferation. Although high PKM2 expression low PK activity considered defining features tumors, little known PKM expression PK activity change along continuum low grade high grade tumors, changes relate tumor growth. address issue, measured PKM isoform expression PK activity normal brain, neural progenitor cells, series 100 astrocytomas ranging benign grade pilocytic astrocytomas highly aggressive grade IV glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). glioma exhibited comparably reduced levels PKM1 expression PK activity relative normal brain. contrast, grade I-III gliomas modestly increased levels PKM2 RNA protein expression relative normal brain, GBM, regardless whether arose de novo progressed lower grade tumors, showed 3-5 fold increase PKM2 RNA protein expression. Low levels PKM1 expression PK activity important cell growth PKM1 over-expression accompanying increases PK activity slowed growth GBM cells. increased expression PKM2, however, also important, shRNA-mediated PKM2 knockdown decreased total PKM2 already low levels PK activity, paradoxically also limited cell growth vitro vivo. results show pyruvate kinase expression, pyruvate kinase activity, regulated grade-specific manner glioma, changes PK activity PKM2 expression contribute growth GBM.
