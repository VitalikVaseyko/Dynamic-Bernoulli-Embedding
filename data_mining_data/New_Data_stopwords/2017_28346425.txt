 Tumor cells preferentially adopt aerobic glycolysis energy supply, phenomenon known Warburg effect. remains matter debate Warburg effect regulated tumor progression. Here, show CHIP (carboxyl terminus Hsc70-interacting protein), U-box E3 ligase, suppresses tumor progression ovarian carcinomas inhibiting aerobic glycolysis. CHIP downregulated ovarian carcinoma, induced expression CHIP results significant inhibition tumor growth examined vitro vivo experiments. Reciprocally, depletion CHIP leads promotion tumor growth. SiLAD proteomics analysis, identified pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2), critical regulator glycolysis tumors, target CHIP mediated degradation. Accordingly, show CHIP regulates PKM2 protein stability thereafter energy metabolic processes. Depletion knockout CHIP increased glycolytic products tumor mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Simultaneously, observed CHIP expression inversely correlated PKM2 levels human ovarian carcinomas. study reveals mechanism Warburg effect regulated CHIP function E3 ligase, mediates degradation PKM2 tumor progression. findings shed new light understanding ovarian carcinomas may provide new therapeutic strategy ovarian cancer.
