 cotton-melon aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, major insect pest worldwide. wasp Lysiphlebia japonica (Ashmead) predominant parasitoid cotton-melon aphids north China. Parasitization reported affect host lipids several systems, lipid synthesis-related genes transcription changes cotton-melon aphid-parasitoid interaction clear. study, 36 lipid synthesis-related genes cloned transcription changes parasitized aphids studied quantitative real-time PCR. parasitized cotton-melon aphids, almost key genes glycerolipid synthesis pathway up-regulated, rate-limiting enzyme diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase 3.24-fold. rate-limiting enzyme glycolytic pathway, pyruvate kinase, pace-making enzyme citrate synthesis 1.69-fold 1.75-fold less parasitized aphids unparasitized aphids, respectively. results suggest increased glycerolipid synthesis parasitized aphids citrate production sucrose decreased. Aconitate hydratase (aco), pathway converts amino acids citrate, up-regulated. number fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads mitochondrial aco2 gene 4.6, whereas cytoplasmic aco1 41.5, indicating citrate comes amino acids cytoplasm parasitized cotton-melon aphids.
