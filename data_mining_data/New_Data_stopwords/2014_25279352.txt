 Low millimolar concentrations ascorbate capable inflicting lethal damage high proportion cancer cells lines, yet leave non-transformed cell lines unscathed. Extracellular generation hydrogen peroxide, reflecting reduction molecular oxygen ascorbate, shown mediate effect. Although cancer cell lines express low catalase activity, cannot fully explain selective sensitivity cancer cells hydrogen peroxide. Ranzato colleagues presented evidence plausible new explanation sensitivity - high proportion cancers, via NADPH oxidase complexes dysfunctional mitochondria, produce elevated amounts superoxide. superoxide, via transition metal-catalyzed transfer electron hydrogen peroxide produced ascorbate, generate deadly hydroxyl radical (Haber-Weiss reaction). thus predicted concurrent measures somewhat selectively boost superoxide production cancers enhance sensitivity i.v. ascorbate therapy. One way achieve increase provision substrate cancer mitochondria. Measures inhibit constitutive hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activity cancers (such salsalate mTORC1 inhibitors, improvement tumor oxygenation), inhibit HIF-1-inducible pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (such dichloroacetate), expected increase pyruvate oxidation. ketogenic diet provide lipid substrate tumor mitochondria. cancer-killing activity 42 degrees C hyperthermia degree contingent increase oxidative stress, likely mitochondrial origin; reports hydrogen peroxide synergizes hyperthermia killing cancer cells suggest hyperthermia i.v. ascorbate could potentiate other's efficacy. concurrent enhancement tumor oxygenation might improve results decreasing HIF-1 activity increasing interaction ascorbic acid oxygen. increased pool labile iron cancer cells may contribute selective susceptibility many cancers i.v. ascorbate; antagonism NF-kappaB activity salicylate, intravenous iron administration, could employed elevate free iron cancers.
