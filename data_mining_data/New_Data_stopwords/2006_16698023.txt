 high rate glycolysis despite presence oxygen tumor cells (Warburg effect) suggests important role process cell division. glycolytic rate dependent cellular concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), which, turn, controlled bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2). ubiquitous PFK-2 isoenzyme (uPFK-2, alternatively named UBI2K5 ACG) coded pfkfb3 gene induced different stimuli (serum, progesterone, insulin, hypoxia, etc.) highest kinase/phosphatase activity ratio amongst PFK-2 isoenzymes discovered date, consistent role powerful activator glycolysis. uPFK-2 expressed brain, placenta, transformed cells proliferating cells. present work, analyze impact small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced silencing uPFK-2 inhibition cell proliferation. HeLa cells treated uPFK-2 siRNA showed decrease uPFK-2 RNA levels measured 24h. uPFK-2 protein levels severely depleted 48-72h compared cells treated unrelated siRNA, correlating decreased glycolytic activity, Fru-2,6-P2, lactate ATP concentrations. metabolic changes led reduced viability, cell-cycle delay increase population apoptotic cells. Moreover, uPFK-2 suppression inhibited anchorage-independent growth. results obtained highlight importance uPFK-2 regulation glycolysis, cell viability proliferation also anchorage-independent growth. data underscore potential uPFK-2 effective tumor therapeutic target.
