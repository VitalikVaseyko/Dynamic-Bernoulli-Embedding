 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), key protein glucose lipid metabolism, reported related carcinogenesis various malignancies. However, roles hepatocellular carcinoma cirrhotic liver (CL) hepatocellular carcinoma non-cirrhoticliver (NCL) haves investigated. study western bloting, qRT-PCR immunohistochemistry performed evaluate clinical significance PKM2 protein expression CL NCL. results revealed PKM2 protein expression significantly higher HCC tissues adjacent non-tumour tissues. high expression rates PKM2 frequently noted CL (45. 6%) NCL (31. 9%) tissues. High PKM2 expression CL NCL tissues significantly associated vascular invasion (P = 0.002 P = 0.004, respectively) intrahepatic metastasis (P < 0.001 P = 0.019, respectively). Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed disease-specific survival (DSS) recurrence-free survival (RFS) lower CL high PKM2 expression NCL high PKM2 expression (P = 0.003 P = 0.003, respectively). Overall, high PKM2 expression frequently found CL NCL, PKM2 overexpression associated poor survival rates patients CL NCL.
