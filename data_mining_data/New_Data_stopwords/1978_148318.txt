 Supply exogenous ethylene lactate-grown yeast initially accelerated rate ethanol production glucose, later reduced rate, overall effect reduce total ethanol production. rate ethanol production ethylene-treated yeast changed removal metabolic carbon dioxide. However, CO2 allowed build absence applied ethylene, ethanol production decreased. Ethylene increased activities number pentose phosphate glycolytic pathway enzymes. largest increase activity observed phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), regulatory enzyme glycolytic pathway. initial stimulation, glucose (and also 3-O-methyl glucose) uptake reduced ethylene. Ethylene appears inhibit non-competitively glucose transport system.
