 Stress conditions (e.g. anoxia) frequently result decrease [ATP] increase [ADP] [AMP], concomitant increase [Mg(2+)] cations, e.g. Ca(2+). elevation [Mg(2+)] linked shift apparent equilibrium adenylate kinase. result, enzymes use Mg(2+) cofactor activated, Ca(2+) activates calcium-dependent signalling pathways, PP(i) serve alternative energy source active form MgPP(i) Mg2PP(i). anoxic conditions plants, important source PP(i) may come result combined reactions PK (pyruvate kinase) PPDK (pyruvate, phosphate dikinase). PP(i) formed PPDK/PK cycle ignites glycolysis conditions low [ATP] involving PP(i)-dependent reactions. saves ATP makes metabolism stress conditions energy efficient.
