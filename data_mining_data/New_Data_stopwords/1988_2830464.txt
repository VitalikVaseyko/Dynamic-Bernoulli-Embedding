 Several ack::Mu d1-8 insertions isolated Salmonella typhimurium MacConkey-glucose-trimethylamine oxide medium. could produce gas glucose absence exogenous formate. Two mutants expressed beta-galactosidase activity shown ack::Mu d1-8 fusions genetic analysis. insertions characterized located genetic map ack locus co-transduction zei::Tn10. gene order zei::Tn10-ack-pta established. direction transcription ack clockwise genetic map. Expression lac operon ack::Mu d1-8 increased twofold anaerobiosis. Addition formate, pyruvate, acetate affect anaerobic expression lac operon ack::Mu d1-8.
