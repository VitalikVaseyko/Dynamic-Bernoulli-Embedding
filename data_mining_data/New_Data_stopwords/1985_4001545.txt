 enzymatic activities two "key" enzymes glycolytic pathway, pyruvate kinase lactic dehydrogenase, studied seven areas brain male adult rats states pharmacologically induced hyper hypothyroidism. brain areas were: anterior cortex, adenohypophysis, hypothalamus, amygdaline nucleus, septum, hippocampus cerebellum. T3 treated animals, pyruvate kinase activity showed significant increase areas studied lactic dehydrogenase activity decreased. propyl-thiouracil treated animals enzyme activities showed significant variations animals control group.
