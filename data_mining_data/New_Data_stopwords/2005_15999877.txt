 effects steroidal sapogenin extract bitter yam commercial diosgenin liver enzyme changes investigated Diabetic male Wistar rats fed diets supplemented 1% steroidal sapogenin extract commercial diosgenin three weeks. Plasma glucose levels activities hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assessed Liver total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol total phospholipid also measured. Plasma glucose decreased significantly (p < 0.05) diabetic rats fed three test diets compared diabetic control. three test diets significantly decreased glucose-6-phosphatase activity compared diabetic control activities ATP-citrate lyase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase significantly reduced liver diabetic rats compared normal control. Supplementation diet bitter yam steroidal sapogenin extract commercial diosgenin significantly alter ATP citrate lyase pyruvate kinase activities significantly increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity liver compared diabetic rats. study shows feeding two test diets diabetic rats results alterations metabolism glucose subsequent reduction plasma glucose concentration.
