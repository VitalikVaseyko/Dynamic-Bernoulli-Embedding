 Computational blind docking approach used mapping possible binding sites L-type pyruvate kinase subunit peptides, RRASVA phosphorylated derivative RRAS(Pi)VA, model phosphorylatable N-terminal regulatory domain enzyme. parallel, docking analysis done substrates enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) adenosine diphosphate (ADP), docking fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), allosteric activator enzyme. binding properties entire surface protein scanned several possible binding sites identified domains C protein, domain B revealed docking sites peptides substrates allosteric regulator. found docking sites different ligands partially overlapping, pointing possibility regulatory effects, observed case L-type pyruvate kinase, may caused competition different ligands binding sites.
