 study, investigate whether tissue-level constraint explain general inverse relationship growth rate precocity development birds. whole, altricial (dependent) chicks grow three four times faster less dependent, able chicks precocial species similar adult mass. suggest antagonism growth acquisition mature function skeletal muscle constrains postnatal growth development species birds. Altricial species, represented European starlings study, hatch skeletal muscle low capacity generating force grow rapidly. Conversely, precocial species (northern bobwhite quail Japanese quail), hatch relatively mature skeletal muscle, especially legs, grow slowly. development proceeds species, exponential growth rates decrease muscles acquire adult levels function. Among four variables associated muscle function, exponential growth rate (EGR) negatively correlated pyruvate kinase activity (glycolysis), potassium concentration (electrical potential), dry weight fraction (contractile proteins) pectoral leg muscles citrate synthase activity (aerobic metabolism) either set muscles. pectoral muscle, variables accounted 87% total variation EGR three species combined despite twofold difference growth rates starling quail. EGRs leg muscle (51% variation accounted for) less predicted pectoral-muscle equation quail early part postnatal period starlings late postnatal period. result would contradict growth rate/maturity constraint hypothesis EGRs down-regulated allometric considerations.
