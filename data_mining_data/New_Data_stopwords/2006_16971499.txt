 Increased conversion glucose lactic acid associated decreased mitochondrial respiration unique feature tumors first described Otto Warburg 1920s. Recent evidence suggests Warburg effect caused oncogenes underlying mechanism malignant transformation. Using novel approach measure cellular metabolic rates vitro, bioenergetic basis increased glycolysis reduced mitochondrial respiration investigated two human cancer cell lines, H460 A549. bioenergetic phenotype analyzed measuring cellular respiration, glycolysis rate, ATP turnover cells response various pharmacological modulators. H460 A549 cells displayed dependency glycolysis ability significantly upregulate pathway respiration inhibited. converse, however, true. cell lines attenuated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity unable sufficiently upregulate mitochondrial OXPHOS glycolysis disabled. observed mitochondrial impairment intimately linked increased dependency glycolysis. Furthermore, demonstrated H460 cells glycolytic, greater impairment mitochondrial respiration, compared A549 cells. Finally, upregulation glycolysis response mitochondrial ATP synthesis inhibition dependent AMP-activated protein kinase activity. summary, results demonstrate bioenergetic phenotype two cancer cell lines characterized increased rate glycolysis linked attenuation OXPHOS capacity. metabolic alterations provide mechanistic explanation growth advantage apoptotic resistance tumor cells.
