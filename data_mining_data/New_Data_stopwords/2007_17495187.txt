 OBJECTIVE: study long-term transcriptomic effects dihydrotestosterone (DHT) adipose tissue. Fat distribution regulated sexual hormones. still unclear androgens promoting reducing intra-abdominal fat accumulation. RESEARCH METHODS PROCEDURES: Retroperitoneal adipose tissue isolated group gonadectomized (GDX) C57BL6 male mice treated vehicle DHT 21 days. Serial analysis gene expression (SAGE) performed generate approximately 150,000 SAGE tags sample. RESULTS: Among numerous genes regulated DHT, transcripts involved glycolysis, aldolase 1 isoform pyruvate kinase muscle well lipogenic transcripts, malic enzyme supernatant ELOVL family member 6 elongation long chain fatty acids down-regulated androgen supplementation. contrast, transcripts involved lipolysis fatty acid oxidation, carboxylesterase 3, acetyl-coenzyme acyltransferase 1, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase B enoyl-coenzyme hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme dehydrogenase up-regulated DHT. Pro-apoptotic transcripts cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 1 NIP3 -interacting protein 3-like up-regulated DHT, whereas transcripts involved promotion cell cycle cyclin D2 down-regulated DHT. DISCUSSION: results suggest chronic androgen treatment may help improve metabolic profile regulating various critical pathways involved adipose tissue physiology. addition, several genes associated healthier metabolic profile, adiponectin CD36 antigen, up-regulated 21 days DHT treatment.
