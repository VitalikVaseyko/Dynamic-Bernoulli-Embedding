 1. physico-chemical constants nutritional regulation pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) hexokinase (HK) rainbow trout liver investigated. 2. maximum activity pH three enzymes appears physiological range. 3. PK-enzyme shows sigmoid kinetic respect PEP Hill-coefficient 3.1; two enzymes show michaelian kinetic substrates. 4. nutritional treatments show HK-enzyme increases level high carbohydrate diet decreases high protein diet starvation. 5. PFK-enzyme decreases high protein diet starvation. 6. PK-enzyme shows decrease level starvation conditions.
