 Cancer cells possess unique metabolic signatures compared normal cells, including shifts aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, de novo biosynthesis macromolecules. Targeting changes agents (drugs dietary components) employed strategies reduce complications associated tumorigenesis. paper highlights ability several food components suppress tumor-specific metabolic pathways, including increased expression glucose transporters, oncogenic tyrosine kinase, tumor-specific M2-type pyruvate kinase, fatty acid synthase, detection effects using various metabonomic technologies, including liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) stable isotope-labeled MS. Stable isotope-mediated tracing technologies offer exciting opportunities defining specific target(s) food components. Exposures, especially early transition phase normal cancer, critical translation knowledge food components effective prevention strategies. Although appropriate dietary exposures needed alter cellular metabolism remain inconsistent and/or ill-defined, validated metabonomic biomarkers dietary components hold promise establishing effective strategies cancer prevention.
