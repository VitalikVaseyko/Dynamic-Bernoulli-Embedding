 Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription factor functions master regulator oxygen homeostasis metazoan species. O(2)-dependent hydroxylation two proline residues HIF-1alpha subunit necessary binding von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, component ubiquitin protein ligase ubiquitinates HIF-1alpha, leading degradation proteasome. majority cases clear cell type renal carcinoma, VHL genes inactivated mutation epigenetic silencing, leading dysregulated HIF-1 transcriptional activity. VHL loss-of-function leads, aerobic conditions, HIF-1-dependent reprogramming glucose energy metabolism includes increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, lactate production accompanied reciprocal decrease respiration. findings delineate first time molecular mechanisms underlying Warburg effect human cancer.
