 Expression c-myc often related control growth differentiation variety cell types. However, cases, relation found. rate cell division low liver, c-myc expression yet easily detected. show short-time physiological fasting results dramatic decrease c-myc expression rat liver. effect seem dependent glucagon, since administration glucagon leads increase c-myc mRNA. knowledge, first evidence physiological variation proto-oncogene expression linked food intake, suggest variation could play role liver cell growth control.
