 BACKGROUND: Vestibular schwannomas (VS) frequently express high levels activated AKT. Small-molecule inhibitors AKT signalling may therapeutic potential suppressing growth benign VS malignant schwannomas. METHOD: Primary VS Schwann cells, human malignant schwannoma HMS-97 cells mouse Nf2(-/-) Schwann cells schwannoma cells prepared investigate growth inhibitory anti-tumour activities OSU-03012, celecoxib-derived small-molecule inhibitor phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. Cell proliferation assays, apoptosis, Western blot, vivo xenograft analysis using SCID mice immunohistochemistry performed. RESULTS: OSU-03012 inhibited cell proliferation effectively VS HMS-97 cells normal human Schwann cells. IC5) OSU-03012 48h approximately 3.1 microM VS cells 2.6 microM HMS-97 cells, compared IC(50) greater 12 microM human Schwann cells. Similarly, mouse Nf2(-/-) schwannoma Nf2(-/-) Schwann cells sensitive growth inhibition OSU-03012 wild-type mouse Schwann cells mouse schwannoma cells established transgenic mice carrying NF2 promoter-driven SV40 T-antigen gene. Like VS cells, malignant schwannoma HMS-97 cells expressed high levels activated AKT. OSU-03012 induced apoptosis VS HMS-97 cells caused marked reduction AKT phosphorylation Ser-308 Thr-473 sites dose-dependent manner. vivo xenograft analysis showed OSU-03012 well tolerated inhibited growth HMS-97 schwannoma xenografts 55% 9 weeks oral treatment. anti-tumour activity correlated reduced AKT phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: OSU-03012 potential chemotherapeutic agent VS malignant schwannomas.
