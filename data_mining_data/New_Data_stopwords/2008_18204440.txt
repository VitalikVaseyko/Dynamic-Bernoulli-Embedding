 three-dimensional matrices cancer cells move rounded, amoeboid morphology controlled ROCK-dependent contraction acto-myosin. study, show PDK1 required phosphorylation myosin light chain cell motility, deformable gels vivo. Depletion PDK1 alters localization ROCK1 reduces ability drive cortical acto-myosin contraction. form ROCK1 regulation require PDK1 kinase activity, instead involves direct binding PDK1 ROCK1 plasma membrane; PDK1 competes directly RhoE binding ROCK1. absence PDK1, negative regulation RhoE predominates, causing reduced acto-myosin contractility motility. work uncovers novel non-catalytic role PDK1 regulating cortical acto-myosin cell motility.
