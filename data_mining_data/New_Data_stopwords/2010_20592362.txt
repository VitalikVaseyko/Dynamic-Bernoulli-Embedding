 BACKGROUND: Cancer cell growth described depend glucose utilization. Activation Akt up-regulation pyruvate kinase M2 (M2-PK) attributes tumour glycolysis. PATIENTS METHODS: order evaluate prognostic relevance glycolytic markers breast cancer, expression pAkt M2PK analysed 160 tissue samples. staining results compared clinicopathological characteristics survival data. RESULTS: Overexpression pAkt detected 58% M2PK 70% breast cancer samples. Increased pAkt-expression accompanied shorter survival time. contrast, M2PK expression significantly higher patients surviving breast cancer 13 years. CONCLUSION: Strong M2PK expression seems favourable prognostic factor role breast cancer progression explored. data confirm previous observations pAkt negative prognostic marker.
