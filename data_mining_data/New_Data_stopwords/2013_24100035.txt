 Metabolic reprogramming cancer manifested persistent aerobic glycolysis suppression mitochondrial function known Warburg effect. Warburg effect contributes cancer progression considered promising therapeutic target. Understanding mechanisms used cancer cells suppress mitochondria may lead development new approaches reverse metabolic reprogramming. evaluated mitochondrial function morphology poorly respiring LM7 143B osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines showing Warburg effect comparison actively respiring Saos2 HOS OS cells noncancerous osteoblastic hFOB cells. LM7 143B cells, detected markers mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), mitochondrial swelling, depolarization, membrane permeabilization. addition, detected mitochondrial swelling human OS xenografts mice archival human OS specimens using electron microscopy. MPT inhibitor sanglifehrin reversed MPT markers increased respiration LM7 143B cells. data suggest MPT may play role suppression mitochondrial function, contributing Warburg effect cancer.
