 One major metabolic changes associated cellular transformation enhanced nutrient utilization, supports tumor progression fueling energy production providing biosynthetic intermediates growth. liver kinase B1 (LKB1) serine/threonine kinase tumor suppressor couples bioenergetics cell-growth control regulation mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) activity; however, influence LKB1 tumor metabolism well defined. Here, show loss LKB1 induces progrowth metabolic program proliferating cells. Cells lacking LKB1 display increased glucose glutamine uptake utilization, support cellular ATP levels increased macromolecular biosynthesis. LKB1-dependent reprogramming cell metabolism dependent hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), accumulates normoxia LKB1-deficient cells antagonized inhibition mTOR complex signaling. Silencing HIF-1alpha reverses metabolic advantages conferred reduced LKB1 signaling impairs growth survival LKB1-deficient tumor cells low-nutrient conditions. Together, data implicate tumor suppressor LKB1 central regulator tumor metabolism growth control regulation HIF-1alpha-dependent metabolic reprogramming.
