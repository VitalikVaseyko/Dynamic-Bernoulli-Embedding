 mechanisms phenylalanine toxic brain phenylketonuria fully understood. Considering brain glucose metabolism reduced patients, main objective determine pyruvate kinase activity brain cortex rats subjected acute chronic chemically induced hyperphenylalaninemia. effect alanine administration enzyme activity treated rats also investigated. also studied vitro effect two amino acids pyruvate kinase activity brain cortex nontreated rats. results indicated phenylalanine inhibits pyruvate kinase vitro vivo alanine prevents inhibitory effect phenylalanine enzyme activity. Considering crucial role pyruvate kinase plays glucose metabolism brain, possible inhibition enzyme activity may contribute brain damage characteristic disease.
