 effects dietary alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) pH value, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, activities glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate kinase postmortem muscle investigated. Eighteen C57BL/6J mice fed diets containing 0%, 0.5%, 1.0% alpha-LA. end 2-week feeding trial, mice killed longissimus muscles sampled 0-, 1-, 24-h postmortem pH determination enzyme assay. results showed dietary alpha-LA treatment significantly slowed decrease pH values postmortem muscle. ultimate pH values postmortem muscle mice receiving 0.5% 1.0% alpha-LA treatments 6.40 6.63, respectively, significantly higher (6.21) alpha-LA treatment (p<0.05). AMPK activated early postmortem stage. Dietary alpha-LA suppress activation AMPK postmortem muscle. 1- 24-h postmortem, activities AMPK much lower postmortem muscle mice receiving 0.5% 1.0% alpha-LA treatments alpha-LA treatment. two dietary alpha-LA treatments, however, difference AMPK activity observed, indicating 0.5% dietary alpha-LA enough suppress AMPK postmortem muscle. Similar AMPK, glycogen phosphorylase activity higher treatment without dietary alpha-LA 0.5% 1.0% dietary alpha-LA supplements. difference activity glycogen phosphorylase observed 0.5% 1.0% dietary alpha-LA treatments. Dietary alpha-LA significant influence activity pyruvate kinase postmortem muscle. results indicate AMPK plays role glycolysis postmortem muscle. Dietary alpha-LA supplementation suppress activation AMPK postmortem muscle, down-regulate activity glycogen phosphorylase, resulting higher ultimate pH values postmortem muscle. Therefore, dietary alpha-LA supplementation potential way reduce incidence pale, soft, exudative (PSE) meat.
