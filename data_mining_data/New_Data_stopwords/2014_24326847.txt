 AIMS BACKGROUND: evaluated difference significance cancer cell metabolism molecular subtyping triple-negative breast carcinoma. METHODS: Tissue microarrays 122 surgical specimens triple-negative breast carcinoma patients immunohistochemical staining CK5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor, claudin 3, claudin 4, claudin 7, E-cadherin, androgen receptor, gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 used classify triple-negative breast carcinoma follows: basal-like type, molecular apocrine type, claudin low type, mixed type null type. addition, immunohistochemical staining metabolism-related proteins c-myc, insulin-like growth factor (g)-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-1alpha, glucose transporter 1, carbonic anhydrase IX antibody, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 used compare differences according molecular subtype clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: basal-like type showed highest proportion high glucose transporter 1 expression (P = 0.049) carbonic anhydrase IX antibody expression (P = 0.008). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-1alpha expression associated lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001) central fibrotic zone (P = 0.012), high glucose transporter 1 expression related high histologic grade (P = 0.007), cytokeratin 5/6 positivity (P = 0.002), central fibrotic zone (P = 0.017). Finally, carbonic anhydrase IX antibody associated cytokeratin 5/6 positivity (P = 0.001) central fibrotic zone (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: study revealed different characteristics cancer cell metabolism according molecular subtypes triple-negative breast carcinoma. Among them, basal-like type glycolytic acid-resistant phenotype.
