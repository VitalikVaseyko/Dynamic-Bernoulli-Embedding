 investigated whether decreased responsiveness heart physiological increases fatty acid availability results lipid accumulation lipotoxic heart disease. Lean obese Zucker rats either fed ad libitum fasted overnight. Fasting increased plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels lean obese rats, although levels greatest obese rats regardless nutritional status. Despite increased fatty acid availability, mRNA transcript levels peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha-regulated genes similar fed lean fed obese rat hearts. Fasting increased expression PPAR-alpha -regulated genes lean Zucker rat hearts, whereas, obese Zucker rat hearts, muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase unaltered fasting. Rates oleate oxidation similar hearts fed rats. However, fasting increased rates oleate oxidation hearts lean rats. Dramatic lipid deposition occurred within cardiomyocytes obese, lean, Zucker rats upon fasting. Cardiac output significantly depressed hearts isolated obese rats compared lean rats, regardless nutritional status. Fasting increased cardiac output hearts lean rats only. Thus, heart's inability increase fatty acid oxidation proportion increased fatty acid availability associated lipid accumulation contractile dysfunction obese Zucker rat.
