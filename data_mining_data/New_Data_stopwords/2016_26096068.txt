 Non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) closely associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) believed play important role NPC pathogenesis virtue ability activate multiple cell signalling pathways collectively promote cell proliferation, transformation, angiogenesis, invasiveness, well modulation energy metabolism. study, report LMP1 increases cellular uptake glucose glutamine, enhances LDHA activity lactate production, reduces pyruvate kinase activity pyruvate concentrations. LMP1 also increases phosphorylation PKM2, LDHA, FGFR1, well expression PDHK1, FGFR1, c-Myc, HIF-1alpha, regardless oxygen availability. Collectively, findings suggest LMP1 promotes aerobic glycolysis. respect FGFR1 signalling, LMP1 increases FGFR1 expression, also up-regulates FGF2, leading constitutive activation FGFR1 signalling pathway. Furthermore, two inhibitors FGFR1 (PD161570 SU5402) attenuate LMP1-mediated aerobic glycolysis, cellular transformation (proliferation anchorage-independent growth), cell migration, invasion nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, identifying FGFR1 signalling key pathway LMP1-mediated growth transformation. Immunohistochemical staining revealed high levels phosphorylated FGFR1 common primary NPC specimens correlated expression LMP1. addition, FGFR1 inhibitors suppress cell proliferation anchorage-independent growth NPC cells. current findings demonstrate LMP1-mediated FGFR1 activation contributes aerobic glycolysis transformation epithelial cells, thereby implicating FGF2/FGFR1 signalling activation EBV-driven pathogenesis NPC.
