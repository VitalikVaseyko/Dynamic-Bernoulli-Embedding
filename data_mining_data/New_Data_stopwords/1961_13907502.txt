 Twenty-five bacterial species cultured basal broth plus 1 19 different carbohydrates sterilized Seitz filtration, autoclaving (112 C, 10 min), exposure 0.2% beta-propiolactone (BPL). significant differences found either visual observations acid gas, pH, titrable acidity determinations 3 days incubation three preparations tested. effort made determine effect BPL heat carbohydrates assaying glucose treatment. Results indicated glucose degraded 0.2% BPL, however, shown autoclave temperatures caused extensive degradation. Statistical treatment results Warburg studies indicated BPL-treated glucose showed appreciable toxic effects, although actual oxygen uptake great Seitz- autoclave-treated glucose. application BPL sterilization process discussed.
