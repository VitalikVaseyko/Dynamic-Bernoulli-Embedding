 PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) activates group protein kinases belonging AGC [PKA (protein kinase A)/PKG (protein kinase G)/PKC (protein kinase C)]-kinase family play important roles mediating diverse biological processes. Many cancer-driving mutations induce activation PDK1 targets including Akt, S6K (p70 ribosomal S6 kinase) SGK (serum- glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase). present paper, describe small molecule GSK2334470, inhibits PDK1 IC(5)(0) ~10 nM, suppress activity 93 protein kinases including 13 AGC-kinases related PDK1 500-fold higher concentrations. Addition GSK2334470 HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293, U87 MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells ablated T-loop residue phosphorylation activation SGK isoforms S6K1 induced serum IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). GSK2334470 also inhibited T-loop phosphorylation activation Akt, efficient inhibiting Akt response stimuli serum activated PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway weakly. GSK2334470 inhibited activation Akt1 mutant lacking PH domain (pleckstrin homology domain) potently full-length Akt1, suggesting GSK2334470 effective inhibiting PDK1 substrates activated cytosol rather plasma membrane. Consistent this, GSK2334470 inhibited Akt activation knock-in embryonic stem cells expressing mutant PDK1 unable interact phosphoinositides potently wild-type cells. GSK2334470 also suppressed T-loop phosphorylation activation RSK2 (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2), another PDK1 target activated ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) pathway. However, prolonged treatment cells inhibitor required observe inhibition RSK2, indicating PDK1 substrates possess distinct T-loop dephosphorylation kinetics. data define PDK1 inhibitors affect AGC signalling pathways suggest GSK2334470 useful tool delineating roles PDK1 biological processes.
