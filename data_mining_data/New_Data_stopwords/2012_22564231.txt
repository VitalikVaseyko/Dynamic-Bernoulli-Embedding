 Analysis proteomic profile pressure ulcers time critical step identification biomarkers healing nonhealing pressure ulcers. wound fluid 32 subjects 42 pressure ulcers evaluated 6 weeks 15 time points. Samples specific interior periphery wound bed collected. Antibody screening arrays, isobaric tags relative absolute quantitation mass spectrometry multiplexed microarrays used characterize wound fluid results correlated clinical outcome. Twenty-one proteins found distinguish healed chronic wounds 19 proteins differentially expressed interior periphery wounds. Four proteins, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2, profilin-1, Ig lambda-1 chain C regions, Ig gamma-1 chain C region, present lower levels periphery samples compared interior samples six proteins, keratin, type II cytoskeletal 6A (KRT6A), keratin, type cytoskeletal 14, S100 calcium binding proteins A7, alpha-1-antitrypsin precursor, hemoglobin subunit alpha, hemoglobin subunit beta, present higher levels periphery samples compared interior samples. S100 calcium binding protein A6, S100 calcium binding protein A7, soluble receptor advanced glycation end-products higher levels periphery chronic wounds vs. interior planar arrays. significant temporal trend noted monokine induced gamma interferon (MIG), synonomous chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), increased wounds healed remained nearly constant ulcers approaching closure.
