 long recognized acute elevation non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) stimulates insulin secretion moderate extent vitro vivo. effects longer-term exposure elevated fatty acids have, however, investigated recently. studies rat documented time dependence NEFA effects, inhibition glucose-induced insulin secretion apparent 6-24 h vivo exposure Intralipid vitro exposure palmitate, oleate octanoate. Evidence indicates inhibitory effects coupled fatty acid oxidation B-cells, ensuing reduction glucose oxidation, parallel diminished activity pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme. findings essentially confirmed human pancreatic islets. db/db mouse, model type 2 diabetes obesity, evidence obtained elevated NEFA playing significant role decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion. Evidence also indicates elevated NEFA inhibit insulin biosynthesis increase proinsulin:insulin ratio secretion. Results experimentally induced elevations NEFA non-diabetic diabetic humans thus far inconclusive. studies needed ascertain impact elevated NEFA insulin secretion clinical settings.
