 Group N streptococci, lactose phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) phospho-beta-d-galactosidase (beta-Pgal), grew rapidly lactose converted 90% sugar l-lactate. contrast, Streptococcus lactis 7962, beta-Pgal, grew slowly lactose converted 15% sugar l-lactate. glucose galactose, strain growth rates fermentation patterns similar S. lactis strains, suggesting rapid homolactic fermentation lactose characteristic group N streptococci dependent upon functional PEP-dependent PTS presence beta-Pgal. Seventeen strains group N streptococci examined activator specificities pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. properties enzyme strains, including S. lactis 7962, similar. Pyruvate kinase broad activator specificity, whereas activation lactate dehydrogenase specific ketohexose diphosphate. intermediates lactose metabolism hexose phosphates triose phosphates activated pyruvate kinase. activation obtained adenosine 5'-monophosphate. K Mg required pyruvate kinase activity could replaced NH(4) Mn, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase activated equally fructose-1,6-diphosphate tagatose-1,6-diphosphate, activation characteristics pH dependent. roles pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase regulation lactose fermentation group N streptococci discussed.
