 Rat M1- L-type pyruvate kinases inactivated photo-oxidation mediated methylene blue pH 8.0 degrees C according first-order kinetics. pH profiles inactivation rates isozymes showed amino acid residues pK value 7.0-7.5 involved inactivation. Three histidine residues per subunit M1- L-type enzyme destroyed photo-oxidation complete loss enzyme activities. However, two three photo-oxidized histidine residues L-type enzyme important inactivation reaction. kinetics partially inactivated L-type enzyme suggests complete inactivation achieved via intermediate form low affinity phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). observations revealed involvement essential histidine residues two different kinds catalytic mechanism L-type enzyme. photo-oxidation M1-type enzyme, intermediate form observed. Addition PEP pyruvate reaction mixture markedly prevented photo-oxidative inactivation M1-type enzyme presence K+ Mg2+; addition ADP ATP ineffective even presence metal ions. protective effect PEP counteracted addition ATP ADP. However, photo-oxidative inactivation L-type enzyme prevented even addition PEP presence metal ions, owing low affinity PEP 0 degrees C, spite presence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
