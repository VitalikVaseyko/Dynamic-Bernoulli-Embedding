 objective present study investigate effects oral selenate application comparison selenium deficiency selenite treatment development diabetic status (glucose tolerance, insulin resistance activities glycolytic gluconeogenic marker enzymes) dbdb mice, representing type II diabetic animal model. Therefore 21 adult male dbdb mice assigned 3 experimental groups 7 animals put selenium deficient diet (< 0.03 mg/kg diet) based torula yeast. Group 0Se kept selenium deficiency 10 weeks mice groups SeIV SeVI supplemented daily 15% individual LD(50) sodium selenite sodium selenate addition diet. 10 weeks distinct melioration diabetic status indicated corrected glucose tolerance lowered insulin resistance measured selenate treated mice (group SeVI) comparison selenium deficient selenite treated companions initial status. Activities glycolytic marker enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase increased 1.7 3-fold liver and/or adipose tissue selenate treatment compared mice selenium deficiency mice selenite administration. contrast selenate treatment (SeVI) repressed activity liver pyruvate carboxylase first enzyme gluconeogenesis 33% comparison selenium deficient (0Se) selenite treated mice (SeIV). However current study revealed insulinomimetic role selenate (selenium VI) also type II diabetic animals due melioration insulin resistance. contrast selenium deficiency especially selenite (selenium IV) impaired diabetic status dbdb mice, demonstrating need investigations insulinomimetic action selenium due metabolism different selenium compounds.
