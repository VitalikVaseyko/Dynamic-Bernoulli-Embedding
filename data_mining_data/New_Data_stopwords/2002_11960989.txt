 Deficiency human erythrocyte isozyme (RPK) is, together glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, common cause nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. provide molecular framework disease, solved 2.7 resolution crystal structure human RPK complex fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, allosteric activator, phosphoglycolate, substrate analogue, functionally structurally characterized eight mutants (G332S, G364D, T384M, D390N, R479H, R486W, R504L, R532W) found RPK-deficient patients. mutations target distinct regions RPK structure, including domain interfaces catalytic allosteric sites. mutations affect different extent thermostability, catalytic efficiency, regulatory properties. studies first correlate clinical symptoms molecular properties mutant enzymes. Mutations greatly impairing thermostability and/or activity associated severe anemia. mutant proteins exhibit moderate changes kinetic parameters, sufficient cause mild severe anemia, underlining crucial role RPK erythrocyte metabolism. Prediction effects mutations difficult relation nature location replaced amino acid type molecular perturbation. Characterization mutant proteins may serve valuable tool assist diagnosis genetic counseling.
