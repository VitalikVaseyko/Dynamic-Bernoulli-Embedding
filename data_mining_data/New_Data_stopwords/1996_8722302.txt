 Serotoninergic neuronal networks included regulation modification eating behavior energy metabolism. Dexfenfluramine (dF), serotonin releaser reuptake inhibitor, used investigate changes food intake, body weight development, energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, substrate oxidation rates 12 days. Rats made obese postnatal overfeeding received energy-controlled mash diet water ad libitum intraperitoneally injected either saline 5 10 mg dF/kg. compared controls, food intake energy expenditure significantly decreased dose-dependent manner, especially first 6 days. Lipid oxidation increased, oxidation carbohydrates decreased. body weight slightly reduced 2 days dF treatment. 4 days, dF-treated rats resumed body weight, compared controls dF groups exhibited lower body weights end experiment. 12 days plasma glucose concentration unchanged, whereas plasma free fatty acids significantly decreased. Plasma insulin levels unchanged dF, 10 mg dF/kg led increased muscle and, especially liver glycogen contents, indicating improved nonoxidative glucose disposal. Muscle pyruvate kinase slightly significantly increased dF treatment liver significantly decreased, indicating reduced glycolytic activity liver. Whereas renal N excretion rather decreased, plasma concentrations urea, citrulline, arginine, ornithine increased, liver contents glutamine arginine decreased. Possibly, shift ammonia removal glutamine synthesis production urea. sum large neutral amino acids muscle significantly decreased dF treatment, indicating diminished proteolysis. Pair-feeding experiments 2 days revealed solely result diminished food intake, also additional metabolic effect dF, different anorectic effect. concluded increased oxidation endogenous fat reduced food intake could mediate body weight reducing effect dF.
