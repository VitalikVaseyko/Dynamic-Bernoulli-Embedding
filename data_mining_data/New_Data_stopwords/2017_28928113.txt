 RATIONALE: Pregnancy profoundly alters maternal physiology. heart hypertrophies pregnancy, metabolic adaptations, well understood. OBJECTIVE: determine mechanisms underlying cardiac substrate use pregnancy. METHODS RESULTS: use (13)C glucose, (13)C lactate, (13)C fatty acid tracing analyses show hearts late pregnant mice increase fatty acid uptake oxidation tricarboxylic acid cycle, reducing glucose lactate oxidation. Mitochondrial quantity, morphology, function seem altered. Insulin signaling seems intact, abundance localization major fatty acid glucose transporters, CD36 (cluster differentiation 36) GLUT4 (glucose transporter type 4), also unchanged. Rather, find pregnancy hormone progesterone induces PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) cardiomyocytes elevated PDK4 levels late pregnancy lead inhibition PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) pyruvate flux tricarboxylic acid cycle. Blocking PDK4 reverses metabolic changes seen hearts late pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, data indicate hormonal environment late pregnancy promotes metabolic remodeling heart level PDH, rather level insulin signaling.
