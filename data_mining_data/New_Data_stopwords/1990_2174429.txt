 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) rapidly stimulated production lactate hepatocytes isolated fed rats. results indicate enzymes glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway involved actions. EGF stimulated CO2 release 1-position glucose, caused small significant increase pyruvate kinase activity. addition, EGF caused rise fructose 1,6-bisphosphate fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentrations, indicating activation phosphofructokinase. TPA alter concentrations sugar phosphates, cause increased lactate production CO2 production 1-position glucose similar EGF. Furthermore, EGF stimulation lactate formation independent presence medium Ca2+. Phenylephrine stimulation process, parallel incubations, entirely dependent upon presence Ca2+ medium. conclude EGF stimulates glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway isolated hepatocytes fed rats. duplication actions TPA suggests protein kinase C mediator EGF action hepatocytes.
