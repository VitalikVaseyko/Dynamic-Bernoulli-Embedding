 Ground bovine longissimus rabbit white muscles frozen (-25 degrees C) prerigor state subsequently thawed(+20 degrees C) determine combined effect grinding freezing glycolytic metabolites enzymes. Frozen ground muscle, compared unfrozen ground tissue, showed significantly lower hexose monophosphates significantly greater levels metabolites fructose diphosphate phosphoenolpyruvate, indicating activation phosphofructokinase inhibition pyruvate kinase freezing process. Thawing caused rapid glycolysis metabolites returned near unfrozen levels time glycolysis ceased, due strong activation phosphorylase Ca2+. muscle types similar pattern changes.
