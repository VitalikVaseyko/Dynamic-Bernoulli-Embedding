 Recent evidence laboratory indicates least two isoenzymic forms pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1 PDK2) may involved regulation enzymatic activity mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphorylation (Popov, K.M., Kedishvili, N.Y., Zhao, Y., Gudi, R., Harris, R.A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29720-29724). present study undertaken explore diversity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase gene family. report deduced amino acid sequences three isoenzymic forms PDK found humans. terms primary structures, two isoenzymes identified humans correspond rat PDK1 PDK2, whereas third gene (PDK3) encodes new isoenzyme shares 68% 67% amino acid identities PDK1 PDK2, respectively. PDK3 cDNA expressed Eschierichia coli directs synthesis polypeptide molecular mass approximately 45,000 Da possesses catalytic activity toward kinase-depleted pyruvate dehydrogenase. PDK3 appears highest specific activity among three isoenzymes tested recombinant proteins. Tissue distribution three isoenzymes human PDK characterized Northern blot analysis. highest amount PDK2 mRNA found heart skeletal muscle, lowest amount placenta lung. Brain, kidney, pancreas, liver expressed intermediate amount PDK2 (brain > kidney = pancreas > liver). tissue distribution PDK1 mRNA differs markedly PDK2. message PDK1 expressed predominantly heart modest levels expression tissues (skeletal muscle > liver > pancreas > brain > placenta = lung > kidney). contrast PDk1 PDK2, expressed tissues tested, message PDK3 found almost exclusively heart skeletal muscle, indicating PDK3 may serve specialized functions characteristic muscle tissues. tissues tested thus far, level expression PDK2 mRNA essentially higher PDK1 PDK3, consistent idea PDK2 major isoenzyme responsible regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase human tissues.
