 assess influence environment fruit metabolism, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum 'Moneymaker') plants grown contrasting conditions (optimal commercial, water limited, shaded production) locations. Samples harvested nine stages development, 36 enzyme activities central metabolism measured well protein, starch, major metabolites, hexoses, sucrose, organic acids, amino acids. remarkable result high reproducibility enzyme activities throughout development, irrespective conditions location. Hierarchical clustering enzyme activities also revealed tight relationships metabolic pathways phases development. Thus, cell division characterized high activities fructokinase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, indicating ATP production priority, whereas cell expansion characterized enzymes involved lower part glycolysis, suggesting metabolic reprogramming anaplerosis. expected, enzymes involved accumulation sugars, citrate, glutamate strongly increased ripening. However, group enzymes involved ATP production, probably fueled starch degradation, also increased. Metabolites levels seemed sensitive enzymes environment, although differences tended decrease ripening. integration enzyme metabolite data obtained contrasting growth conditions using principal component analysis suggests that, exceptions alanine amino transferase glutamate malate dehydrogenase malate, links single enzyme activities metabolite time courses levels.
