 Intermittent retrograde cold blood cardioplegia compared retrograde crystalloid cardioplegia. Twenty-two adult patients underwent open heart surgery divided two groups. Group BCP (n = 10) protected 15 degrees C blood containing potassium 15 mEq/l; Group CCP (n = 12) protected 4 degrees C St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution. Lactate, pyruvate, CK-MB levels coronary sinus blood measured 5 15 minutes aortic unclamping 5 minutes weaning cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) groups. CPB time, cross-cross clamp time, incidence postoperative low output syndrome spontaneous return sinus rhythm aortic unclamping different two groups. Cardiac index pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measured immediately weaning CPB, different groups. Lactate level significantly low group BCP. Lactate uptaking ratio myocardium significantly high group BCP. CK-MB levels different two groups. Cold blood cardioplegia seemed provide better aerobic myocardial metabolism aortic cross clamp. However, CK-MB levels hemodynamic studies different.
