 paper extends model acid-mediated tumour invasion chemotherapy intervention examined part I. model presented part considers interaction tumour cells, normal cells, acid drug well mixed (i.e. spatially homogeneous) setting, governed system nonlinear differential equations. model examined removes assumption populations spatially homogeneous resulting system nonlinear partial differential equations. Numerical simulations model presented different treatment methods displaying several possible behaviours. Asymptotic approximations also derived special case treatment method set parameter values. analysis allows us draw conclusions effectiveness treating acid-mediated tumours chemotherapy.
