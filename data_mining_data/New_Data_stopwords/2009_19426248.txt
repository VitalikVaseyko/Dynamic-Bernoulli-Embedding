 Doxorubicin common chemotherapeutic anticancer drug. use associated adverse effects including cardiotoxicity. Several therapeutics interventions attempted reduce toxicity improve efficacy drug. However, phytochemicals investigations made. present study evaluated potential cardenolide, periplogenin, isolated leaves Aegle marmelos protecting doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity lipid peroxidation (LPO) rats. Doxorubicin induced cardiac hepatotoxicity characterized marked biochemical changes including increase serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), tissue LPO, decrease superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH). also increased levels different serum lipids, decreased amount high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Cotherapy test cardenolide doxorubicin 4 weeks reversed adverse effects. However, three different concentrations (12.5, 25, 50 mg/kg p.o.) test periplogenin, 25 mg/kg appeared effective. efficacy compared vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) isolated compound exhibited better therapeutic potential. isolated periplogenin leaves A. marmelos could potentially inhibit doxorubicin-induced cardiovascular problems rats. However, moderate dose found effective.
