 Stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) improves functional recovery postischemic hearts. study examined potential mechanism mediated substrate-dependent proton production intracellular pH. 20 min ischemia, isolated rabbit hearts reperfused without 5 mM dichloroacetate (DCA) presence either 5 mM glucose, 5 mM glucose + 2.5 mM lactate, 5 mM glucose + 2.5 mM pyruvate. DCA inhibits PDH kinase, increasing proportion dephosphorylated, active PDH. Unlike pyruvate glucose alone, lactate + glucose support effects DCA recovery rate-pressure product (RPP) (without DCA, RPP = 14,000 +/- 1,200, n = 6; DCA, RPP = 13,700 +/- 1,800, n = 9). Intracellular pH, (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, returned normal within 2.1 min reperfusion substrates except lactate + glucose + DCA lactate + DCA, delayed pH recovery 12 min (at 2.1 min pH = 6. 00 +/- 0.08, lactate + glucose + DCA; pH = 6.27 +/- 0.34, lactate + DCA). Hearts also reperfused 10 min ischemia 0.5 mM palmitate + 5 mM DCA either 2.5 mM pyruvate 2.5 mM lactate. Again, intracellular pH recovery delayed presence lactate. PDH activation presence lactate also decreased coupling oxidative metabolism mechanical work. findings implications therapeutic use stimulated carbohydrate oxidation stunned hearts.
