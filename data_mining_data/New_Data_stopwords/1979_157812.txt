 purpose present study investigate interactions ATP, ADP calcium binding rat heart sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (SR), re-evaluate assay method used study calcium binding. Calcium binding transport studied Millipore filtration method. Rat heart SR unusually high Mg2+ stimulated ATPase activity (1.37 +/- 0.16 mumol Pi per min per mg 25 degrees C) previous incubation ATP calcium binding studies releases ADP Pi. maintaining ATP high ADP low concentrations ATP-regenerating system (phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase), calcium binding capacity increased two three times non-ATP-regenerating system direct relationship amount Ca-binding SR protein concentration. Ca2+ Mg2+ concentrations controlled ATP ADP concentrations varied independently initial rate Ca-binding inhibited 25% 1 mmol.litre-1 ADP 48% 3mmol.litre-1 ADP. ATP limited initial rate Ca-binding ATP levels 2mmol.litre-1. low ATP concentrations Ca-release observed. However, presence ATP-regenerating system Ca-release observed, even low concentrations ATP. study shows ADP inhibitor Ca-binding rat heart SR. However, possibility high ADP concentrations presence Pi ATP hydrolysis, could facilitate calcium release cannot excluded. addition possible physiological importance, effects must regarded assaying rat cardiac SR calcium binding.
