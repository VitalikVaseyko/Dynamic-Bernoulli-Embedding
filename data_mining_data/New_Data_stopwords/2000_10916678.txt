 Pyruvate kinase deficiency frequent enzyme abnormality Embden-Meyerhof pathway causing hereditary non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia. degree haemolysis varies widely, ranging mild fully compensated forms, life-threatening neonatal anaemia jaundice necessitating exchange transfusions. Splenectomy reserved young patients require regular blood transfusions. gene encoding pyruvate kinase (PK-LR) localized long arm chromosome I; cDNA R-type 2060 bp long codes 574 amino acids. 130 different mutations, mostly missense, far described association PK deficiency, 1529A 1456T considered common mutations Caucasians. Analysis three-dimensional structure enzyme may help predicting severity molecular defect. data clinical features homozygous patients needed, least mutations, allow precise genotype/phenotype correlation.
