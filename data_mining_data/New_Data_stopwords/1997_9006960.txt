 Chronic elevation glucose pleiotropic effects pancreatic beta-cell including high rate insulin secretion low glucose, beta-cell hypertrophy, hyperplasia. actions glucose expected associated modulation expression number glucose-regulated genes need identified. investigate molecular mechanisms implicated adaptation processes hyperglycemia, studied regulation genes encoding key glycolytic enzymes glucose-responsive beta-cell line INS-1. Glucose (from 5 25 mM) induced phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) isoform C, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (4-fold), L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) (7-fold) mRNAs. contrast expression level glucokinase (Gk) 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase transcripts remained unchanged. Following 3-day exposure elevated glucose, similar induction observed protein level PFK-1 (isoforms C, M, L), GAPDH, L-PK, whereas M-PK expression increased slightly. study mechanism GAPDH induction indicated glucose increased transcriptional rate GAPDH gene transcriptional post transcriptional effects contributed GAPDH mRNA accumulation. 2-Deoxyglucose mimic inductive effect glucose, suggesting increased glucose metabolism involved GAPDH gene induction. changes glycolytic enzyme expression associated 2-3-fold increase insulin secretion low (2-5 mM) glucose. metabolic activity cells also elevated, indicated reduction artificial electron acceptor 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium. marked deposition glycogen, readily mobilized upon lowering ambient glucose, increased DNA replication also observed cells exposed elevated glucose. results suggest coordinated induction key glycolytic enzymes well massive glycogen deposition implicated adaptation process beta-cell hyperglycemia allow chronically elevated glucose metabolism, which, particular fuel-sensitive cell, linked metabolic coupling factor production cell activation.
