 Short-term long-term regulation hepatic carbohydrate metabolism insulinlike growth factor-I studied primary cultures adult rat hepatocytes compared metabolic potency insulin. Insulinlike growth factor-I stimulated formation [14C]lactate [14C]glucose three-fold half-maximally effective concentration approximately 50 nmol/L. Basal glycogenolysis inhibited 20%, glucagon-activated glycogenolysis blocked completely insulinlike growth factor-I half-maximally effective concentrations 1.5 2 nmol/L. activity key glycolytic enzymes glucokinase pyruvate kinase induced twofold. glucagon-dependent induction phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase--the key gluconeogenic enzyme--was antagonized half-maximally effective concentration 5 nmol/L. inhibition glucagon-dependent induction enzyme accompanied similar reduction increase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-mRNA level assessed Northern blot analysis. potency insulinlike growth factor-I half-maximally effective concentrations approximately 2% 4% insulin. binding studies demonstrated comparably low affinity insulinlike growth factor-I insulin receptor, suggested adult liver--in contrast fetal regenerating liver--insulinlike growth factor-I could exert short-term long-term metabolic effects parenchymal cells interaction insulin receptor.
