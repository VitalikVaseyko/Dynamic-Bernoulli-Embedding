 short-term effects insulin phorbol esters regulation albumin gene rat H4IIE (H4) hepatoma cells investigated compared expression gene known inhibited agents, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). insulin phorbol esters inhibited transcription albumin gene rapid, dose-dependent manner. Within 15 min, albumin transcription reduced approx. 80%. inhibitory effects insulin evident concentrations insulin low 5.10(-11)M, suggesting effects mediated insulin-specific pathways. ability phorbol esters insulin inhibit albumin transcription suggests negative control gene stable feature H4 cells. effect phorbol esters mimic insulin action albumin gene, several genes cell line, implies common pathway may shared insulin phorbol esters.
