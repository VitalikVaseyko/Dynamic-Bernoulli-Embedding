 mammals, excess energy stored primarily triglycerides, mobilized energy demands arise. review mainly focuses role long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) regulating energy metabolism ligands peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPAR-alpha expressed primarily liver essential metabolic adaptation starvation inducing genes beta-oxidation ketogenesis downregulating energy expenditure fibroblast growth factor 21. PPAR-delta highly expressed skeletal muscle induces genes LCFA oxidation fasting endurance exercise. PPAR-delta also regulates glucose metabolism mitochondrial biogenesis inducing FOXO1 PGC1-alpha. Genes targeted PPAR-gamma adipocytes suggest PPAR-gamma senses incoming non-esterified LCFAs induces pathways store LCFAs triglycerides. Adiponectin, another important target PPAR-gamma may act spacer adipocytes maintain metabolic activity insulin sensitivity. Another topic review effects skin LCFAs energy metabolism. Specific LCFAs required synthesis skin lipids, essential water barrier thermal insulation functions skin. Disturbance skin lipid metabolism often causes apparent resistance developing obesity expense normal skin function.
