 Tyrosine accumulates inborn errors tyrosine catabolism, especially tyrosinemia type II. disease caused tyrosine aminotransferase deficiency, eyes, skin, central nervous system disturbances found. present study, investigated chronic effect tyrosine methyl ester (TME) and/or creatine plus pyruvate parameters oxidative stress enzyme activities phosphoryltransfer network cerebral cortex homogenates 21-day-old Wistar. Chronic administration TME induced oxidative stress altered activities adenylate kinase mitochondrial cytosolic creatine kinase. Total sulfhydryls content, GSH content, GPx activity significantly diminished, DCFH oxidation, TBARS content, SOD activity significantly enhanced TME. hand, TME administration decreased activity CK cytosolic mitochondrial fractions enhanced AK activity. contrast, TME affect carbonyl content PK activity cerebral cortex rats. Co-administration creatine plus pyruvate effective prevention alterations provoked TME administration oxidative stress enzymes phosphoryltransfer network, except mitochondrial CK, AK, SOD activities. results indicate chronic administration TME may stimulate oxidative stress alter enzymes phosphoryltransfer network cerebral cortex rats. case also occurs patients affected disorders, may contribute, along mechanisms, neurological dysfunction hypertyrosinemias, creatine pyruvate supplementation could beneficial patients.
