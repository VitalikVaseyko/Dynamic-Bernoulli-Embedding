 Many ectotherms respond low temperature adjusting capacities enzymes energy metabolism, restructuring membrane phospholipids modulating membrane fluidity. Although much known temperature biology earthworms, known extent earthworms employ compensatory changes enzymatic capacities membrane physical properties exposure low temperature. examined activities enzymes glycolysis central oxidative pathways well fluidity phospholipid fatty acid composition mitochondrial membranes prepared body wall temperate oligochaete Lumbricus terrestris one month acclimation 5 degrees 15 degrees C. compensation occurs central pathways oxidative metabolism since activities cytochrome-c oxidase citrate synthase, measured common temperature, similar 5 degrees C 15 degrees C-acclimated animals. contrast, activity pyruvate kinase elevated 1.3-fold acclimation 5 degrees C. Mitochondrial membranes display inverse compensation respect temperature (membranes 5 degrees C animals ordered membranes 15 degrees C animals). results, combination earlier reports, indicate routine metabolism L. terrestris may maintained reduced temperatures little change enzymatic capacities inverse compensation mitochondrial membranes.
