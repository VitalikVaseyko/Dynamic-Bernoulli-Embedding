 Reductively metabolized glutamine major cellular carbon source fatty acid synthesis hypoxia mitochondrial respiration impaired. Yet, mechanistic understanding determines reductive metabolism missing. identify several cellular conditions alpha-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio changed due altered acetyl-CoA citrate conversion, demonstrate reductive glutamine metabolism initiated response perturbations result increase alpha-ketoglutarate/citrate ratio. Thus, targeting reductive glutamine conversion therapeutic benefit might require distinct modulations metabolite concentrations rather targeting upstream signalling, indirectly affects process.
