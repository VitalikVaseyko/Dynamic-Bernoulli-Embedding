 GLycolytic enzymes studied normal human retinas (both fetal adult) retinoblastomas eight patients established retinoblastoma cell line. significant differences found enzyme activities tissues investigated except hexokinase pyruvate kinase, significantly decreased tumor cells. fetal retina, five different forms pyruvate kinase could detected electrophoresis (K4, K3M, K2M2, KM3, M4). adult retina K4 isozyme almost absent, retinoblastoma M4 isozyme hardly present. retinoblastoma cell line, M4 isozyme completely absent. Alanine inhibition pyruvate kinase retinoblastoma cell line inhibited compared pyruvate kinase fetal retina retinoblastoma even inhibited compared adult retina. Electrophoresis aldolase adult retina revealed presence potential A-C hybrids (A4, A3C, A2C2, AC3, C4). Fetal retina, however, characterized predominance type. patterns observed retinoblastoma cell line retinoblastoma. However, brain tumors, e.g., gliomas adults, five-membered A-C hybrid set found. Electrophoresis hexokinase normal fetal adult retina revealed predominance hexokinase type I; retinoblastoma retinoblastoma cell line characterized presence considerable amounts hexokinase type II. isozyme shifts retinoblastoma result enzyme pattern identical fetal retina except presence hexokinase type II.
