 liver plays central role control blood glucose homeostasis maintaining balance glucose production utilization. farnesoid X receptor (FXR) bile acid-activated nuclear receptor. Hepatic FXR expression regulated glucose insulin. identify role FXR control hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. submitted controlled fasting-refeeding schedule, FXR(-/-) mice displayed accelerated response high carbohydrate refeeding accelerated induction glycolytic lipogenic genes pronounced repression gluconeogenic genes. Plasma insulin glucose levels lower FXR(-/-) mice upon refeeding high-carbohydrate diet. alterations paralleled decreased hepatic glycogen content. Hepatic insulin sensitivity unchanged FXR(-/-) mice. Treatment isolated primary hepatocytes synthetic FXR agonist attenuated glucose-induced mRNA expression well promoter activity L-type pyruvate kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, Spot14. Moreover, activated FXR interfered negatively carbohydrate response elements regions. results identify novel role FXR modulator hepatic carbohydrate metabolism.
