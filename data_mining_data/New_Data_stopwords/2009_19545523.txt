 obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii important pathogen humans animals. tachyzoite T. gondii main life-cycle stage responsible toxoplasmosis. Study antigenicity soluble tachyzoite antigen (STAg) important discovery protective antigens aid detection prevention toxoplasmosis. present, complete proteome map T. gondii STAg established, although large-scale whole proteomic analysis tachyzoites underway. study, 1227 protein spots T. gondii soluble tachyzoite antigen (STAg) fractionated 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) pH range 3-10. mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, among separated 1227 protein spots, 426 identified searching Swissport NCBI nr databases. Two hundred thirty identified spots (230/426, 54%) demonstrated T. gondii protein MS. 21 Toxoplasma protein spots identified Western blot rabbit anti-T. gondii serum, 16 immunoregulatory functions five immune defense functions. Due multiple spots single protein, 16 spots represented 11 proteins: putative protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), pyruvate kinase (PK), putative glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), coronin, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), protein kinase C receptor 1 (RACK1), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), major surface antigen 1 (SAG1), uridine phosphorylase (UPase) peroxiredoxin (Prx). Among identified 11 proteins, except antigenicity immunogenicity SAG1 reported antigenicity Hsp70 disputed, remaining antigenic proteins first identified study. conclusion, obtained nine novel types immunogenic proteins might potential candidates vaccine development toxoplasmosis, confirm later studies.
