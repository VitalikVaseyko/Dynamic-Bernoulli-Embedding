 molecular alterations responsible characteristic enzyme abnormalities pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency investigated two unrelated children homozygous PK deficiency. variant enzymes characterized according recommendations International Committee Standardization Haematology. Genomic DNA specifically amplified polymerase chain reaction. Normal mutant alleles L-type PK gene analyzed nucleotide sequencing. Heterozygosity parents confirmed allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. PK Linz C base exchange position 394 L-type PK gene found. result, 132nd amino acid mutant enzyme, arginine (CGC), replaced cysteine (TGC). affected amino acid residue located within deduced active site protein enzyme variant shows strongly altered allosteric properties. PK Beirut shows C substitution position 1058, changing 353 amino acid threonine (ACG) methionine (ATG). contrast PK Linz, amino acid lies outside deduced substrate binding site kinetic parameters PK Beirut close normal. enzyme variants show markedly reduced specific activity thermolability.
