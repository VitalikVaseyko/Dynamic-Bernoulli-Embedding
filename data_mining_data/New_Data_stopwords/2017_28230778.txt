 efficacy cancer treatments often limited associated substantial toxicity. Appropriate combination drug targeting specific mechanisms may regulate metabolism tumor cells reduce cancer cell growth improve survival. Therefore, investigated effects anti-diabetic drug Metformin (Met) natural compound caffeic acid (trans-3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, CA) alone combination treat aggressive metastatic human cervical HTB-34 (ATCC CRL-1550) cancer cell line. CA concentration 100 microM, unlike Met 10 mM, activated 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). more, CA contributed fueling mitochondrial tricarboxylic acids (TCA) cycle pyruvate increasing Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDH) activity, Met promoted glucose catabolism lactate. Met downregulated expression enzymes fatty acid de novo synthesis, ATP Citrate Lyase (ACLY), Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS), Fatty Acyl-CoA Elongase 6 (ELOVL6), Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase-1 (SCD1) cancer cells. conclusion, CA mediated reprogramming glucose processing TCA cycle via oxidative decarboxylation. increased oxidative stress, result CA treatment, sensitized cancer cells and, acting cell biosynthesis bioenergetics, made HTB-34 cells susceptible Met successfully inhibited neoplastic cells. combination Metformin caffeic acid suppress cervical carcinoma cells two independent mechanisms may provide promising approach cancer treatment.
