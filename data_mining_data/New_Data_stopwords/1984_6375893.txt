 Reagents required reactions produce chemiluminescence (CL) bioluminescence (BL) may coupled antibodies antigens used labels immunoassay. methods based CL BL low detection limits, potential replace assays currently employ radioisotopes labels. feasibility several BL CL labels demonstrated. date, isoluminol derivatives widely studied. Several steroid assays involving isoluminol labels reported, labelled compound detected levels approaching 10(17) moles. Acridinium ester-labelled compounds also detected level. addition systems label reactant required light, CL BL used analyze amount product generated enzyme labels. approach also yielded low detection limits. Systems developed using enzyme labels catalyze formation ATP assayed firefly reaction catalyze formation peroxide determined either luminol peroxyoxalate CL.
