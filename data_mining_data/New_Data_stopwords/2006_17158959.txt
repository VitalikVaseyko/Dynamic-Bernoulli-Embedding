 respiration-deficient, highly glycolytic metabolic phenotype cancer cells known "Warburg effect" appreciated many years. new study (see Pelicano et al. p. 913 issue) demonstrates respiration deficiency caused mitochondrial mutation hypoxia may directly promote enormous survival advantage observed cancer cells activation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt survival pathway. discuss recent findings show metabolic changes associated cancer play significant role tumor biology.
