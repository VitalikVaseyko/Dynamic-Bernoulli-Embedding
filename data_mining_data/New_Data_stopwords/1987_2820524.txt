 increase bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) decrease pyruvate kinase (PK), i.e. decrease PK/BPGM ratio, observed red cell populations anemic rats containing 95% 3% reticulocytes blood. ratio used study fractionation recticulocytes, according degree maturation, counter-current distribution cell populations dextranpoly (ethylene glycol) two-phase systems. applying procedure fractionation according age erythrocytes normal rats, decrease PK cellular age observed without significant variation BPGM activity.
