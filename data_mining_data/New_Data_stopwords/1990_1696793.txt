 Freshwater turtles (Pseudemys scripta elegans) exposed 0.5-13 h anoxia 25 degrees C, whereupon brain concentrations 14 amino acid monoamine neurotransmitters related substances measured. Monoamines particular interest, synthesis (in part) degradation require molecular oxygen. anoxia, level inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased (2.3-fold 13 h) level excitatory transmitter Glu fell. Furthermore, anoxia caused increases levels Ala (14 times 13 h), Tau, Gly, Ser, whereas Gln level fell. increase Ala likely inhibit pyruvate kinase, thereby mediating decreased rate glycolysis seen prolonged anoxia. increased level Tau might protect turtle brain Ca2(+)-mediated anoxic damage. monoamine metabolites almost vanished within hours anoxia, indicating halt monoamine synthesis breakdown, dopamine level fell. Nevertheless, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine levels maintained 13 h anoxia, levels extremely high compared mammals, suggesting adaptive mechanisms stockpiling. hypothesized pattern change levels amino acids (notably GABA Glu) monoamines functional significance, promotes decrease brain activity energy consumption seen anoxic turtles.
