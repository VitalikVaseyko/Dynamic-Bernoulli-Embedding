 Assay maximal activities 11 glycolytic enzymes cell-free buffalo sperm extracts showed hexokinase, phosphofructokinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase lowest activities, suggesting regulation fructolysis steps catalysed enzymes. ratios glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/phosphofructokinase (0.67) phosphoglycerate kinase/phosphofructokinase (4.60) typical cells exhibiting high Pasteur effect (50% ejaculated buffalo spermatozoa). regulatory nature phosphofructokinase shown modulation ATP, AMP inorganic phosphate. determination fructolytic intermediates cofactors calculation mass action ratios enzymic step revealed hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, fructose-biphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase catalysed reactions far removed equilibrium. regulatory role glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase appeared likely triosephosphates inorganic phosphate accumulated anaerobic aerobic conditions.
