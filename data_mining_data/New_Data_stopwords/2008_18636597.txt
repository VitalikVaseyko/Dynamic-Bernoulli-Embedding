 physiology central carbon metabolism Corynebacterium glutamicum investigated study specific disruption mutants. Mutants deficient phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC) and/or pyruvate kinase (PK) activity constructed disrupting corresponding gene(s) via transconjugation. Standard batch fermentations carried mutants results evaluated context intracellular flux analysis. following determined. (a) significant reduction glycolytic pathway flux pyruvate kinase deficient mutants growth glucose, also evidenced secretion dihydroxyacetone glyceraldehyde. resulting metabolic overflow accommodated pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) acting mechanism dissimilating, form CO(2), large amounts accumulated intermediates. (b) high activity PPP causes overproduction reducing power form NADPH. overproduction biosynthetic reducing power, well shortage NADPH produced via tricarboxylic acid cycle (as evidenced reduced citrate synthase flux), compensated increased activity transhydrogenase (THD) enzyme catalyzing reaction NADPH + NAD(+)<-->NADP(+) + NADH. presence active THD also confirmed directly enzymatic assays. (c) Specific glucose uptake rates declined course fermentation decline pronounced case double mutant strain deficient PPC PK. Specific ATP consumption rates similarly declined course batch. However, approximately strains, indicating energetic requirements biosynthesis maintenance independent specific genetic background strain. results underline importance intracellular flux analysis, producing static set intracellular flux estimates, also uncovering changes occurring course batch fermentation result specific genetic modifications.
