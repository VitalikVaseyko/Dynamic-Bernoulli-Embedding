 UNLABELLED: Genes encoding enzymes involved fatty acids (FA) glucose oxidation transcriptionally regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), members nuclear receptor superfamily. conditions associated O(2) deficiency, PPAR-alpha modulates substrate switch (between FA glucose) aimed adequate energy production maintain basic cardiac function. Both, positive negative effects PPAR-alpha activation myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury reported. Moreover, role PPAR-mediated metabolic shifts cardioprotective mechanisms preconditioning (PC) relatively less investigated. explored effects PPAR-alpha upregulation mimicking delayed "second window" PC I/R injury rat heart potential downstream mechanisms involved. Pretreatment rats PPAR-alpha agonist WY-14643 (WY, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h prior I/R reduced post-ischemic stunning, arrhythmias extent lethal injury (infarct size) apoptosis (caspase-3 expression) isolated hearts exposed 30-min global ischemia 2-h reperfusion. Protection associated remarkably increased expression PPAR-alpha target genes promoting FA utilization (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 carnitine palmitoyltransferase I) reduced expression glucose transporter GLUT-4 responsible glucose transport metabolism. addition, enhanced Akt phosphorylation protein levels eNOS, conjunction blunting cardioprotection NOS inhibitor L-NAME, observed WY-treated hearts. CONCLUSIONS: upregulation PPAR-alpha target metabolic genes involved FA oxidation may underlie delayed phase PC-like protection rat heart. Potential non-genomic effects PPAR-alpha-mediated cardioprotection may involve activation prosurvival PI3K/Akt pathway downstream targets eNOS subsequently reduced apoptosis.
