 characterization L-type PK made PK extracted liver patient congenital hemolytic anemia associated erythrocyte PK variant, PK Nagasaki. L-type PK PK Nagasaki showed following parameters: slow migration electrophoresis, high Km PEP without F-1,6-P2, less activation F-1,6-P2, normal Km ADP, high utilization UDP, acidic pH optimum, instability urea heat. tests served differentiate L-type PK variant variants previously reported. time, Km PEP F-1,6-P2 saturation electrophoretic mobility L-type PK found different erythrocyte PK PK Nagasaki. Though liver cell, regard L-type PK, less functional less stable mutant L-type PK evidence liver dysfunction damage, although chronic hemolytic anemia.
