 Colorectal cancer (CRC) cured cases diagnosed early stage. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) remains widely used cancer marker determining prognosis CRC. Previous studies shown plasmatic tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (Tu M2-PK) highly sensitive CRC detection early stage equally good results established tumor markers clinical potential cancer prognosis monitoring. aim study assess prognostic value Tu M2-PK plasma using survival analysis combination CEA serum patients newly diagnosed CRC. initial study included 183 patients complete diagnostic colonoscopy. cohort study designed evaluate survival patients histologically confirmed gastrointestinal cancers (n = 41). Tu M2-PK concentrations EDTA plasma determined immunologically using ELISA assay. Plasma Tu M2-PK levels significantly higher patients distant metastases, stage IV TNM score, advanced stage (C+D) subgroups Dukes subgroups. univariate Cox's analysis showed CEA Tu M2-PK gave high hazard ratios risk death (odds ratio CEA = 3.57 odds ratioTu M2-PK = 2.23) comparable values average survival time. results biomarkers overlap. findings suggest plasmatic Tu M2-PK levels 20 U/mL may predictor death risk.
