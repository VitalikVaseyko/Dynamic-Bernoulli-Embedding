 Thiamine acts coenzyme transketolase (Tk) pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes, enzymes play fundamental role intracellular glucose metabolism. relationship thiamine diabetes mellitus (DM) reported literature. Thiamine levels thiamine-dependent enzyme activities reduced DM. Genetic studies provide opportunity link relationship thiamine DM (such Tk, SLC19A2 gene, transcription factor Sp1, alpha-1-antitrypsin, p53). Thiamine derivatives demonstrated prevent activation biochemical pathways (increased flux polyol pathway, formation advanced glycation end-products, activation protein kinase C, increased flux hexosamine biosynthesis pathway) induced hyperglycemia DM.Thiamine definitively role diabetic endothelial vascular diseases (micro macroangiopathy), lipid profile, retinopathy, nephropathy, cardiopathy, neuropathy.
