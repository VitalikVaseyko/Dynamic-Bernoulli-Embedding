 Mitochondria-originating reactive oxygen species (ROS) control cell receptor (TCR)-induced gene expression. Here, show TCR-triggered activation ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK), alternative, glycolytic enzyme typical Archaea, mediates generation oxidative signal. also show ADPGK localized endoplasmic reticulum suggest active site protrudes toward cytosol. ADPGK-driven increase glycolytic metabolism coincides TCR-induced glucose uptake, downregulation mitochondrial respiration, deviation glycolysis toward mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(GPD) shuttle; i.e., metabolic shift aerobic glycolysis similar Warburg effect. activation respiratory-chain-associated GPD2 results hyperreduction ubiquinone ROS release mitochondria. parallel, mitochondrial bioenergetics ultrastructure altered. Downregulation ADPGK GPD2 abundance inhibits oxidative signal generation induction NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression, whereas overexpression ADPGK potentiates them.
