 contrast mitochondria healthy cells, utilize oxidative phosphorylation, malignant cells undergo elevated glycolysis energy production using glucose. objectives study evaluate whether expression various molecules, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), involved altered glucose metabolism associated gastric cancer prognosis assess role therapeutic agent targeting glucose metabolism gastric cancer. Immunohistochemistry performed gastric cancer tissues obtained 152 patients underwent curative resection assess expression hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), hexokinase-2 (HK-2) PDK-1. vitro analysis, lactate production glucose uptake levels, cellular viability 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) responses evaluated treatment dichloroacetate (DCA), PDK-1 inhibitor, MKN45 AGS gastric cancer cell lines non-cancerous HEK293 cell line. GLUT-1 PDK-1 expression significantly associated tumor progression, although PDK-1 expression independent prognostic factor patients received 5-FU adjuvant treatment. significant difference cell viability HEK293 gastric cancer cell lines following DCA treatment. However, DCA treatment reduced lactate production increased responsiveness 5-FU MKN45 cells, expressed high levels PDK-1 comparison cell lines. Thus, PDK-1 may serve biomarker poor prognosis patients gastric cancer. addition, PDK-1 inhibitors DCA may considered additional treatment option patients PDK-1-expressing gastric cancers.
