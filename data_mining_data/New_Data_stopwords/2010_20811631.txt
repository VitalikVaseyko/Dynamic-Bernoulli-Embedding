 BACKGROUND: Alterations glucose consumption biosynthetic activity amino acids, lipids nucleotides metabolic changes sustaining cell proliferation cancer cells. Irrevocable evidence fact Warburg effect establishes cancer cells prefers glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation generate ATP. Regulatory action metabolic enzymes opened new window designing effective anti-cancer treatments. enterprise trivial development computational models contribute identifying potential enzymes breaking robustness cancer cells priority. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: work presents constraint-base modeling experimentally studied metabolic pathways supporting cancer cells: glycolysis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate, glutaminolysis oxidative phosphorylation. evaluate predictive capacities, growth kinetics study Hela cell lines accomplished qualitatively compared silico predictions. Furthermore, based pure computational criteria, concluded set enzymes (such lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase) perform pivotal role cancer cell growth, findings supported experimental counterpart. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Alterations metabolic activity crucial initiate sustain cancer phenotype. work, analyzed phenotype capacities emerged constructed metabolic network conformed experimentally studied pathways sustaining cancer cell growth. Remarkably, silico model able resemble physiological conditions cancer cells successfully identified enzymes currently studied therapeutic effect. Overall, supplied evidence constraint-based modeling constitutes promising computational platform to: 1) integrate high throughput technology establish crosstalk experimental validation silico prediction cancer cell phenotype; 2) explore fundamental metabolic mechanism confers robustness cancer; 3) suggest new metabolic targets anticancer treatments. issues central explore cancer cell metabolism systems biology perspective.
