 Hyperhomocysteinemia common independent risk factor cardiovascular diseases. promoting effect homocysteine (Hcy) vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation considered one important pathological bases atherosclerosis. However, mechanism VSMC proliferation induced Hcy remains unclear. present research used proteomic techniques globally analyze protein changes proliferative VSMCs. comparing protein expression profiles VSMCs Hcy-treated non-treated groups, 11 protein spots found altered markedly proliferative VSMCs expression eight protein spots increased three protein spots decreased. differentially expressed proteins, eight protein spots identified successfully including glycolytic metabolism proteins: pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) aldose reductase (AR); cytoskeletal proteins: lamin C vimentin; three proteins: calreticulin; similar WDR1 protein LIM SH3 protein 1. differentially expressed proteins validated Western blot confirmed assay enzymes' activities ATP content. results may provide clues comprehensively understanding mechanism VSMC proliferation pathogenesis atherosclerosis induced Hcy.
