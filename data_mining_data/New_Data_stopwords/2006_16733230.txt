 BACKGROUND: reported insulin modestly stimulates NAD(P)H oxidase activity cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) synergistically stimulates enzyme activity angiotensin II (Ang II), leading synergistic stimulation VSMC migration. aim study determine mechanism insulin-stimulated NAD(P)H oxidase activity. METHODS: Cultured rat VSMC O(2)(-) H(2)O(2) production measured lucigenin luminol luminescence, respectively, lactate pyruvate content cell lysates determined measuring increase loss, respectively, NADH presence lactate dehydrogenase. Migration VSMC determined wound closure method. RESULTS: Administration 1 nmol/L insulin increased lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR), hence NADH/NAD(+) ratio 122 +/- 16% (P < .05). Exogenous lactate (5 mmol/L), increased LPR similarly insulin, increased O(2)(-) production 123% +/- 32% (P < .05); Ang II (50 nmol/L) increased 60% +/- 9% (P < .05); together agents synergistically increased O(2)(-) production 343% +/- 72% control value (P < .05 v sum lactate-and Ang II-stimulated values), diphenyleneiodonium-sensitive apocynin-sensitive manner. Blocking increase insulin LPR exogenous pyruvate oxaloacetate blocked insulin's stimulation insulin's plus Ang II's synergistic stimulation O(2)(-)production well insulin's stimulation migration Ang II-treated VSMC. Insulin plus Ang II also stimulated H(2)O(2) production. Neither wortmannin pertussis toxin, inhibit insulin-stimulated NAD(P)H oxidase activity cell types, affected insulin insulin plus Ang II-stimulated O(2)(-)production. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin stimulates NAD(P)H oxidase activity Ang II synergistically stimulates cultured rat VSMC increasing NADH/NAD(+) redox potential, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase heterotrimeric G(iota) protein-dependent pathways.
