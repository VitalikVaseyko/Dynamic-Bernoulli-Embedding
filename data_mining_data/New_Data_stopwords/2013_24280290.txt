 BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) fatal plasma cell malignancy exhibiting enhanced glucose consumption associated aerobic glycolytic phenotype (i.e., Warburg effect). previously demonstrated myeloma cells exhibit constitutive plasma membrane (PM) localization GLUT4, consistent dependence MM cells transporter maintenance glucose consumption rates, proliferative capacity, viability. purpose study investigate molecular basis constitutive GLUT4 plasma membrane localization MM cells. FINDINGS: elucidated novel mechanism myeloma cells achieve constitutive GLUT4 activation involving elevated expression Rab-GTPase activating protein AS160_v2 splice variant promote Warburg effect. AS160_v2-positive MM cell lines display constitutive Thr642 phosphorylation, known required inactivation AS160 Rab-GAP activity. Importantly, show enforced expression AS160_v2 required GLUT4 PM translocation activation select MM lines. Furthermore, demonstrate ectopic expression full-length, phospho-deficient AS160 mutant sufficient impair constitutive GLUT4 cell surface residence, characteristic MM cells. CONCLUSIONS: first study tie AS160 de-regulation increased glucose consumption rates Warburg effect cancer. Future studies investigating connections insulin/IGF-1/AS160_v2/GLUT4 axis FDG-PET positivity myeloma patients warranted could provide rationale therapeutically targeting pathway MM patients advanced disease.
