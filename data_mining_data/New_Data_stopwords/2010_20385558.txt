 phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway plays key role cancer cell growth, survival, angiogenesis. Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) acts focal point pathway immediately downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase PTEN, phosphorylates numerous AGC kinases. PDK1 kinase domain least three ligand-binding sites: ATP-binding pocket, peptide substrate-binding site, groove N-terminal lobe binds C-terminal hydrophobic motif kinase substrates. Based unique PDK1 substrate recognition system, ultrahigh throughput TR-FRET Alphascreen screening assays developed using biotinylated version PDK1-tide substrate containing activation loop AKT fused pseudo-activated hydrophobic motif peptide. Using full-length PDK1, K(m) values determined 5.6 mum ATP 40 nm fusion peptide, revealing 50-fold higher affinity compared classical AKT(Thr-308)-tide. Kinetic biophysical studies confirmed PDK1 catalytic mechanism rapid equilibrium random bireactant reaction. Following ultrahigh throughput screen large library, 2,000 compounds selected reconfirmed hits computational analysis focus novel scaffolds. ATP-competitive hits deconvoluted dose-response studies 1x 10x K(m) concentrations ATP, specificity binding assessed thermal shift assay. Inhibition studies using fusion PDK1-tide1 substrate versus AKT(Thr-308)-tide kinase selectivity profiling revealed novel selective alkaloid scaffold evidently binds PDK1-interacting fragment pocket. Molecular modeling suggests structural paradigm design inhibitory versus activating allosteric ligands PDK1.
