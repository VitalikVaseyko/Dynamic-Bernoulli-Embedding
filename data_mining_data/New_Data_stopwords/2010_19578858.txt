 Honeybees, Apis mellifera, show temporal polyethism, begin adult life performing tasks inside hive (hive bees) switch foraging 2-3 weeks old (foragers). Usually hive tasks require little flying, whereas foraging involves flying several hours day carrying heavy loads nectar pollen. Flight muscles particularly plastic organs respond use disuse, accordingly would expected adjustments flight muscle metabolism occur throughout bee's life. thus investigated changes lifetime flight metabolic rate flight muscle biochemistry differently aged hive bees foragers varying foraging experience. Rapid increases flight metabolic rates early life coincided switch troponin isoforms increases flight muscle maximal activities (V (max)) enzymes citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase. However, increases flight metabolic rate experienced foragers occurred without additional changes vitro V (max) flight muscle metabolic enzymes. Estimates vivo flux (v) compared maximum flux enzyme vitro (fractional velocity, v/V (max)) suggest enzymes operate higher fraction V (max) mature foragers compared young hive bees. results indicate honeybees develop flight muscle metabolic machinery early life. increases flight metabolism age foraging experience likely achieved operating metabolic enzymes closer maximal flux capacity.
