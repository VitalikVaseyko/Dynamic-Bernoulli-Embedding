 Neuromedin U (NmU) neuropeptide belonging neuromedin family. Recently, reported significant association NmU breast cancer, particularly correlating increased aggressiveness, resistance HER2-targeted therapies overall significantly poorer outcome patients, although mechanism exerts effect remained unexplained. Investigating this, found ectopic over-expression NmU HER2-positive breast cancer cells induced aberrant metabolism, increased glycolysis, likely due enhanced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity. Similar results observed HER2-targeted drug-resistant cell variants, previously shown display increased levels NmU. Overexpression NmU also resulted upregulation epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers increased IL-6 secretion which, together aberrant metabolism, associated cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed NmU-overexpressing HER2-targeted drug-resistant cells showed increased proportion cells CSC phenotype (CD44(+) /CD24(-) ). Taken together, results report new mechanism action NmU HER2-overexpressing breast cancer enhances resistance HER2-targeted drugs conferring CSC characteristics expansion CSC phenotype.
