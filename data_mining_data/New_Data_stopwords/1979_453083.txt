 procedure developed phenotype eight erythrocytic enzymes, phosphoglucomutase (PGM1), adenylate kinase (AK), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), adenosine deaminase (ADA), glyoxalase (GLO), esterase-D (EsD), acid phosphatase (AcP), glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT) one acrylamide gel also detect presence common abnormal hemoglobins. agar overlay technic eliminated. simplified procedure renders phenotyping erythrocytic enzymes practical paternity testing.
