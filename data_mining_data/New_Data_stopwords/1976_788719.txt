 1. Comparisons homologous enzymes species adapted widely different temperatures reveal ligand-binding affinities rigorously conserved. interpreted mean critical relationship ligand-binding ability intracellular ligand concentrations must maintained proper enzymic regulation. 2. catalytic efficiencies enzyme homologues differ temperature-compensatory manners. Activation free energies proportional adaptation temperature and, consequently, low-temperature-adapted enzymes highest substrate turnover numbers. 3. Temperature compensatory adjustments catalytic efficiency may achieved altering number weak bonds form break catalytic conformational change. Support hypothesis comes finding activation enthalpy activation entropy values co-vary regular manner magnitudes consistent different amounts weak-bond formation/rupture catalytic activation differnt enzyme homologues. 4. Adaptive adjustments ligand-binding energetics may also involve utilization energy changes occur conformational changes. mechanism would permit enzymes identical binding-site chemistries display adaptively different ligand affinities. 5. greater heat-stabilities enzymes warm-adapted species may cause enzymes less efficient catalysts cold-adapted heat-labile enzymes. Heat-stable enzymes may break weak bonds catalytic conformational change cold-adapted enzymes. requirements thermal stability high catalytic efficiency thus appear force adaptational 'compromise'.
