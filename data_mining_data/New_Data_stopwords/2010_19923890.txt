 Here, propose new model understanding Warburg effect tumor metabolism. hypothesis epithelial cancer cells induce Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) neighboring stromal fibroblasts. cancer-associated fibroblasts, undergo myo-fibroblastic differentiation, secrete lactate pyruvate (energy metabolites resulting aerobic glycolysis). Epithelial cancer cells could take energy-rich metabolites use mitochondrial TCA cycle, thereby promoting efficient energy production (ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation), resulting higher proliferative capacity. alternative model tumorigenesis, epithelial cancer cells instruct normal stroma transform wound-healing stroma, providing necessary energy-rich micro-environment facilitating tumor growth angiogenesis. essence, fibroblastic tumor stroma would directly feed epithelial cancer cells, type host-parasite relationship. termed new idea "Reverse Warburg Effect." scenario, epithelial tumor cells "corrupt" normal stroma, turning factory production energy-rich metabolites. alternative model still consistent Warburg's original observation tumors show metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis. support idea, unbiased proteomic analysis transcriptional profiling new model cancer-associated fibroblasts (caveolin-1 (Cav-1) deficient stromal cells), shows upregulation (1) myo-fibroblast markers (2) glycolytic enzymes, normoxic conditions. validated expression proteins fibroblastic stroma human breast cancer tissues lack stromal Cav-1. Importantly, loss stromal Cav-1 human breast cancers associated tumor recurrence, metastasis, poor clinical outcome. Thus, absence stromal Cav-1 may biomarker "Reverse Warburg Effect," explaining powerful predictive value.
