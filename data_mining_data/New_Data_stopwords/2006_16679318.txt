 Mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDC) key metabolic assembly comprising 60-meric pentagonal dodecahedral E2 (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase) core attached 30 pyruvate decarboxylase E1 heterotetramers 6 dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase E3 homodimers maximal occupancy. Stable E3 integration mediated accessory E3-binding protein (E3BP) located 12 E2 icosahedral faces. Here, present evidence novel subunit organization E3 E3BP form subcomplexes 1:2 stoichiometry implying existence network E3 "cross-bridges" linking pairs E3BPs across surface E2 core assembly. also determined low resolution structure truncated E3BP/E3 subcomplex using small angle x-ray scattering showing one E3BP lipoyl domains docked E3 active site. new level architectural complexity mammalian PDC contrasts recently published crystal structure human E3 complexed cognate subunit binding domain provides important new insights subunit organization, catalytic mechanism regulation intrinsic PDC kinase.
