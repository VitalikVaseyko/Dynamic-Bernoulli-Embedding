 Purpose/Aim: Cancer cells addicted glycolytic anaerobic pathways, presence absence functional Krebs' cycle (phenomenon Warburg). metabolic predilection relies extracellular (impaired vascularization oxygenation) intracellular (oncogenic activation genes) causes. MATERIALS METHODS: investigated expression prognostic relevance enzymes involved glucose absorption metabolism, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) expression, MCT1 MCT2, pentose pathway (Glucose-6-phospahte dehydrogenase G6PD), glycogene synthesis (glycogene synthase GYS1), glycolysis (Hexokinase HXKII, phosphofructokinase PFK1, fructose biphosphate aldolase), fate pyruvate (pyruvate dehydrogenase PDH, phosphorylated pPDH, PDH kinase PDK1, lactate dehydrogenase LDH5 LDH1) key Kreb's cycle enzymes (citrate synthase CSynth isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH). RESULTS: strong overexpression enzymes/proteins noted varying percentage cases examined. interesting significant correlation enzymes involved glycolysis LDH5 noted. Adenocarcinomas expressed higher levels GLUT1 MCT2 compared subtypes. Stage (p = 0.0001), aldolase (p = 0.004), LDH5 (p = 0.008), GLUT2 (p = 0.008), MCT2 (p = 0.009), GSYS1 (p = 0.04), GLUT1 (p = 0.05) significantly related poor disease specific overall survival. multivariate analysis stage (p = 0.001), LDH5 (p = 0.04), pPDH (p = 0.04), aldolase (p = 0.04) independent prognostic variables. CONCLUSION: concluded orchestrated activation glucose absorption metabolism towards anaerobic pathways characterize majority NSCLC, phenotype strongly linked aggressive clinical behavior. glycolytic addiction lung cancer cell revealed key therapeutic target.
