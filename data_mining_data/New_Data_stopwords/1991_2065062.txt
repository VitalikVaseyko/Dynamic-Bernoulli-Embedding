 order investigate potential role cytosolic phosphates ([ATP], [ADP] [Pi]) integration mitochondrial respiration mechanical function perfused heart, inhibition substrate end respiratory chain amytal employed. stepwise increase amytal concentration (from 0.2 1.2 mM) resulted progressive abolition cardiac oxygen consumption, rate (VO2) hearts oxidizing pyruvate (5 mM). inhibition curve VO2 S-shaped, K0.5 = 1.1 mM, independent initial VO2 values varied coronary flow isoproterenol (Iso) addition. ADP-stimulated respiration isolated mitochondria (malate + pyruvate) twice sensitive amytal inhibition, whereas state 2 respiration (before ADP addition) sensitivity cardiac VO2. Decrease VO2 followed decline phosphocreatine (PCr) content augmentation Pi nearly constant ATP level intracellular pH assessed 31P-NMR method. changes associated elevation cytosolic free [ADP] reduction [ATP]/[ADP] ratio ATP affinity calculated creatine kinase equilibrium. Concomitantly, pressure-rate product (PRP), maximal rates contraction relaxation fell end diastolic pressure (EDP) rose initial loads. Amytal-inhibited hearts retained capability respond Iso stimulation (0.1 microM, 50% enhancement PRP) even 1 mM amytal, response elevation coronary flow greatly diminished. Alterations PRP value induced inhibitor fixed coronary flow correlated negatively cytosolic [ADP] [Pi], positively [ATP]/[ADP] A(ATP). contrast, EDP correlated parameters opposite manner. However, PRP varied coronary flow absence inhibitor fixed concentrations, correlations absent. data imply cytosolic phosphates serve feedback energy production utilization control point(s) (are) mitochondria. contrast, regulatory mechanisms involved control distributed among different steps located energy producing utilizing systems.
