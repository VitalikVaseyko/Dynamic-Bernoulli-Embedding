 PURPOSE: transcription factor Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) plays critical roles cancer development progression. However, regulatory role underlying mechanisms FOXM1 cancer metabolism unknown. study, characterized regulation aerobic glycolysis FOXM1 impact pancreatic cancer metabolism. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: effect altered expression FOXM1 expression glycolytic enzymes tumor development progression examined using animal models pancreatic cancer. Also, underlying mechanisms altered pancreatic cancer glycolysis analyzed using vitro molecular biology. clinical relevance aberrant metabolism caused dysregulated FOXM1 signaling determined using pancreatic tumor normal pancreatic tissue specimens. RESULTS: found FOXM1 markedly change expression glycolytic enzymes except phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK-1) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA). FOXM1 LDHA overexpressed concomitantly pancreatic tumors cancer cell lines. Increased expression FOXM1 upregulated expression LDHA mRNA protein level elevated LDH activity, lactate production, glucose utilization, whereas reduced expression FOXM1 opposite. studies demonstrated FOXM1 bound directly LDHA promoter region regulated expression LDHA gene transcriptional level. Also, elevated FOXM1-LDHA signaling increased pancreatic cancer cell growth metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Dysregulated expression activation FOXM1 play important roles aerobic glycolysis tumorigenesis patients pancreatic cancer via transcriptional regulation LDHA expression.
