 KRAS mutations occur one third human cancers cluster several hotspots, codons 12 13 commonly affected. suggested position type amino acid exchange influence transforming capacity mutant KRAS proteins. used MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells establish isogenic cell lines express different cancer-associated KRAS mutations (G12C, G12D, G12V, G13C, G13D, A18D, Q61H, K117N) physiological elevated levels, investigated biochemical functional consequences different variants. overall effects low-expressing mutants moderate compared overexpressed variants, allowed delineation biological functions related specific alleles rather KRAS expression level. None mutations induced morphological changes, migratory abilities, increased phosphorylation ERK, PDK1, AKT. KRAS-G12D, G12V, G13D, K117N mediated EGF-independent proliferation, whereas anchorage-independent growth primarily induced K117N Q61H. codon 13 mutations associated increased EGFR expression. Finally, global gene expression analysis MCF10A-G13D versus MCF10A-G12D revealed distinct transcriptional changes. Together, describe useful resource investigating function multiple KRAS mutations provide insights differential effects variants MCF10A cells.
