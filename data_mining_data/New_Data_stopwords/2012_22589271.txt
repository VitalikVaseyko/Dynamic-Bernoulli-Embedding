 Tumors exhibit metabolic reprogramming characterized increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) preferential use glucose, known Warburg effect. However, mechanisms processes linked remain largely elusive. Murine tumors lacking Sirt3 exhibit abnormally high levels ROS directly induce genomic instability increase hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein levels. subsequent transcription HIFalpha-dependent target genes results cellular metabolic reprogramming increased cellular glucose consumption. addition, agents scavenge ROS reverse Warburg effect prevent transformation malignant phenotype observed cells lacking Sirt3. Thus, mice lacking Sirt3 provide model mechanistically connects aberrant ROS, Warburg effect, carcinogenesis.
