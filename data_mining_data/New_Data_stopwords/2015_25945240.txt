 OBJECTIVES: Many cancer cells show significant resistance drugs kill drug sensitive cancer cells non-tumor cells resistance might consequence difference metabolism. Therefore, studying metabolism drug resistant cancer cells comparison drug sensitive normal cell lines objective research. MATERIAL METHODS: Metabolism cisplatin resistant sensitive A2780 epithelial ovarian cancer cells normal ovarian epithelium studied using generic human genome-scale metabolic model transcription data. RESULT: results demonstrate different metabolisms belong resistant normal models, different reactions involved various metabolic pathways. However, large portion distinct reactions related extracellular transport three cell lines. Capability metabolic models secrete lactate investigated find origin Warburg effect. Computational results introduced SLC25A10 gene, encodes mitochondrial dicarboxylate transporter involved exchanging small metabolites across mitochondrial membrane may play key role high growing capacity sensitive resistant cancer cells. metabolic models also used find single combinatorial targets reduce cancer cells growth. Effect proposed target genes growth oxidative phosphorylation normal cells determined estimate drug side-effects. CONCLUSION: deletion results showed although cisplatin cause resistant cancer cells death, shifts cancer cells vulnerable metabolism.
