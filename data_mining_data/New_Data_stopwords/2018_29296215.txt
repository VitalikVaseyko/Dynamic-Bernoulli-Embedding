 Acetyl coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) essential histone acetylation, promote cell proliferation regulating gene expression. However, underlying mechanism(s) governing acetylation remains poorly understood. Activated alpha2-Macroglobulin (alpha2M(*)) signals tumor Cell Surface GRP78 (CS-GRP78) regulate tumor cell proliferation multiple signaling pathway. Here, demonstrate alpha2M(*)/CS-GRP78 axis regulates acetyl-CoA synthesis thus functions epigenetic modulator enhancing histone acetylation cancer cells. alpha2M(*)/CS-GRP78 signaling induces activates glucose-dependent ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) promotes acetate-dependent Acetyl-CoA Synthetase (ACSS1) expression regulating AKT pathways acetylate histones proteins. Further, show acetate regulates ACLY ACSS1 expression feedback loop AKT-dependent manner. studies demonstrate alpha2M(*)/CS-GRP78 signaling central mechanism integrating glucose acetate-dependent signaling induce histone acetylation. importantly, targeting alpha2M(*)/CS-GRP78 axis C38 Monoclonal antibody (Mab) abrogates acetate-induced acetylation histones proteins essential proliferation survival hypoxic stress. Furthermore, C38 Mab significantly reduced glucose uptake lactate consumption definitively suggests role aerobic glycolysis. Collectively, besides ability induce fatty acid synthesis, study reveals new mechanism epigenetic regulation alpha2M(*)/CS-GRP78 axis increase histone acetylation promote cell survival unfavorable condition. Therefore CS-GRP78 might effectively employed target metabolic vulnerability wide spectrum tumors C38 Mab represents potential therapeutic agent.
