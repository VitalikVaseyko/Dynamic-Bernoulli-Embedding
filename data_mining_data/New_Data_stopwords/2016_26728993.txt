 Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays pivotal role regulation various metabolic pathways well liver regeneration. However, casual link cell proliferative effects liver regeneration metabolic regulation FXR elusive. study, found FXR activation significantly promotes HepG2 cell proliferation accompanied metabolic switch towards excessive accumulation aerobic glycolytic intermediates including lactic acid, pyruvate subsequently increased biosynthesis glycine. FXR-induced metabolic switch found dependent up-regulation pyruvate dehydrogenate kinase 4 (PDK4), FXR target gene. FXR agonists found promote liver regeneration murine model APAP induced liver injury, associated metabolic switch favoring accumulation glycolytic intermediates precursors generation biomass. However, FXR activation little effect glycolytic metabolism healthy primary hepatocytes vitro liver healthy mice vivo. Therefore, conclude FXR may promote proliferation tumor cells hepatocytes process liver regeneration activating PDK4-mediated metabolic reprogramming generate glycolytic intermediates essential rapid biomass generation, establishing mechanistic link cell proliferation metabolic switch.
