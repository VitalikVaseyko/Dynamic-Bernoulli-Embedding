 effects gentamicin N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) acid phosphatase (AcP), two lysosomal enzymes present proximal renal tubule cells, studied PKSV-PCT cell line derived proximal convoluted tubules kidney transgenic mouse carrying SV40 large antigen control L-type pyruvate kinase gene. Gentamicin (400 micrograms/ml 72 hr) alter cell viability, significantly reduced cell growth favored formation myeloid bodies. Gentamicin (50 800 micrograms/ml 72 hr) decreased dose-dependent manner cellular NAG PKSV-PCT cells stimulated secretion 20 60%. Chloroquine (50 100 microns) ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 30mM), two lysosomotropic amines known stimulate secretion lysosomal enzymes fibroblasts macrophages, also stimulated secreted NAG PKSV-PCT cells. However, effect chloroquine less marked PKSV-PCT cells cultured mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. Gentamicin induced lysosomal alkalinization but, contrast chloroquine NH4Cl, aminoside strongly stimulated secretion AcP. secretion induced gentamicin nonpolarized, since percentage secreted NAG significantly increased apical basal sides PKSV-PCT cells grown permeable filters. Thus, data suggest gentamicin alters secretion NAG AcP non-specific pathway indicate PKSV-PCT cell line suitable system examine cellular action drugs kidney proximal tubule cells.
