 Red blood cells (RBCs) 15 normal human blood samples incubated different concentrations hydrogen peroxide sodium azide, effects peroxidation several glycolytic nucleotidic enzyme activities investigated. release malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) methemoglobin formation used indicators RBC peroxidation. increase H2O2, final concentration 0.1 5 mmol/l, resulted progressive rise almost glycolytic enzyme activities, especially aldolase (200% normal 1 mmol/l), phosphoglycerate kinase (140%), phosphoglycerate mutase (136%), pyruvate kinase (130%) glutathione peroxidase (130%), decrease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (68%) pyrimidine-5-nucleotidase (23%). addition beta-mercaptoethanol incubation medium abolished effect 1 mmol/l H2O2 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
