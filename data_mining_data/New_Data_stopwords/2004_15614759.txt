 HSSP (Homology-Derived Secondary Structure Proteins) database provides multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) proteins known three-dimensional (3D) structure Protein Data Bank (PDB). database also contains estimate degree evolutionary conservation amino acid position. estimate, based relative entropy, correlates functional importance position; evolutionarily conserved positions (i.e., positions limited variability low entropy) occasionally important maintain 3D structure biological function(s) protein. recently developed Rate4Site algorithm scoring amino acid conservation based calculated evolutionary rate. algorithm takes account phylogenetic relationships homologs stochastic nature evolutionary process. present ConSurf-HSSP database Rate4Site estimates evolutionary rates amino acid positions, calculated using HSSP's MSAs. database provides precalculated evolutionary rates nearly PDB. rates projected, using color code, onto protein structure, viewed online using ConSurf server interface. exemplify database, analyzed detail conservation pattern obtained pyruvate kinase compared results observed using relative entropy scores HSSP database. reassuring know main functional region enzyme detectable using conservation scores. Interestingly, ConSurf-HSSP calculations mapped additional functionally important regions, moderately conserved overlooked original HSSP estimate. ConSurf-HSSP database available online (http://consurf-hssp.tau.ac.il).
