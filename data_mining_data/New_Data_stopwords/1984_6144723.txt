 Addition L-glutamate several citric acid cycle intermediates stimulated phosphorylation protein apparent molecular weight 43,000 ( P43 ) P2-fractions rat cerebral cortex, phosphorylation inhibited dichloroacetic acid, specific inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Comparison several molecular properties phosphorylated P43 phosphorylated alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase indicated proteins extracted similar procedure identical apparent molecular weight isoelectric point. Furthermore, digestion phosphorylated proteins several different proteases presence SDS yielded similar pattern phosphorylated peptides indicating proteins considerable sequence homology. Thus, various pieces evidence indicate P43 alpha-chain pyruvate dehydrogenase similar identical. possible implication glutamate stimulated phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase long term potentiation epilepsy discussed.
