 Viruses accomplish replication exploiting many cellular resources, including metabolites energy. Similarly (+)RNA viruses, tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) induces major changes infected cells. However, source energy required fuel TBSV replication unknown. find TBSV co-opts cellular glycolytic ATP-generating pyruvate kinase (PK) directly viral replicase complex boost progeny RNA synthesis. co-opted PK generates high levels ATP within viral replication compartment expense reduction cytosolic ATP pools. ATP generated co-opted PK used promote helicase activity recruited cellular DEAD-box helicases, involved production excess viral (+)RNA progeny. Altogether, recruitment PK local production ATP within replication compartment allow virus replication machinery access plentiful ATP, facilitating robust virus replication.
