 C(4) photosynthesis, part CO(2) fixed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) leaks bundle-sheath cells. CO(2) leak wastes ATP consumed C(4) cycle, leak may decrease efficiency CO(2) assimilation. examine possibility, studied light dependence CO(2) leakiness (phi), estimated concurrent measurements gas exchange carbon isotope discrimination, initial activities ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), phosphorylation state PEPC CO(2) assimilation rate using leaves Amaranthus cruentus (NAD-malic enzyme subtype, dicot) plants grown high light (HL) low light (LL). phi constant photon flux densities (PFDs) >200 micromol m(-2) s(-1) around 0.3. PFDs <150 micromol m(-2) s(-1), phi increased markedly PFD decreased. 40 micromol m(-2) s(-1), phi 0.76 HL 0.55 leaves, indicating efficiency CO(2) assimilation low PFD greater leaves. activities Rubisco PPDK, phosphorylated state PEPC decreased PFD decreased. Theoretical calculations mathematical model clearly showed increase phi decreasing PFD contributed decrease CO(2) assimilation rate. also shown 'conventional' quantum yield photosynthesis obtained fitting straight line light response curve CO(2) assimilation rate low PFD region seriously overestimated. Ecological implications increase phi discussed.
