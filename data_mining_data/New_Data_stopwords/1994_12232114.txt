 Inorganic phosphate (Pi) enrichment Pi-limited green alga Selenastrum minutum dark caused 2.5-fold increase rate O2 consumption. Alkalization media Pi assimilation consistent H+/Pi cotransport mechanism stoichiometry least 2 H+ cotransported per Pi. Dark O2 consumption remained enhanced beyond period Pi assimilation recover medium reacidified. result, coupled immediate decrease adenylate energy charge following Pi enrichment, suggested respiration regulated ATP requirements plasmalemma H+-ATPase activated maintain intracellular pH provide proton motive force power Pi uptake. Concentrations tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates decreased following Pi enrichment respiratory CO2 efflux increased, indicating tricarboxylic acid cycle activated supply reductant mitochondrial electron transport chain. results consistent direct inhibition electron transport ADP limitation. Enhanced rates starch breakdown increases glycolytic metabolites indicated respiratory carbon flow activated supply reductant electron transport chain rapidly assimilate Pi metabolic intermediates. mechanism initiates glycolytic carbon flow could clearly identified product:substrate ratios due complex nature Pi assimilation. High levels triose-P low levels phosphoenolpyruvate primary regulators pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase, respectively.
