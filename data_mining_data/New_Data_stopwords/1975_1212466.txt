 effect adenylic acid, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate phosphoenolpyruvate creatine kinase isoenzymes (brain extract, muscle heart extracts purified muscle enzyme) studied. effectors, especially phosphoenolpyruvate, shown inhibit different degree reaction ATP formation catalysed creatine kinase tissues. effectors inhibit creatine phosphate synthesis extracts, depress purified creatine kinase. interrelationship creatine kinase system key glycolytic enzymes (phosphofructokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase) discussed.
