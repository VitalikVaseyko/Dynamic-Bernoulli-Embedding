 specific activities glucosephosphate isomerase, aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase higher synaptoplasmic fraction rat brain 100,000 g supernatant fraction rat brain homogenates supernatants prepared high ionic strength solutions. Four enzymes synaptosomes two enzymes homogenates associated particulate fractions indicated large increase specific activity enzymes samples treated 0.3 KCl centrifugation. Glucosephosphate isomerase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase enzymes showed large increase specific activity following salt treatment isolated, synaptosomal membrane aldolase pyruvate kinase two enzymes showed large increase specific activity high speed supernatant fractions. specific activities many enzymes found elevated synaptosomes synaptosomal membrane fractions suggested enzymes may provide potential significantly enhanced glycolysis locations.
