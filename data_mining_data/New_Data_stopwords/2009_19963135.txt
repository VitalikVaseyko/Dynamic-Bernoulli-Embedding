 Energy deregulation abnormalities tumor cell metabolism critical issues understanding cancer. Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) aggressive form RCC characterized germline mutation Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH), one known highly metastatic unusually lethal. considerable utility establishing preclinical cell xenograft models study disorders energy metabolism, well development new therapeutic approaches targeting tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme-deficient human cancers. describe new immortalized cell line, UOK 262, derived patient aggressive HLRCC-associated recurring kidney cancer. investigated gene expression, chromosome profiles, efflux bioenergetic analysis, mitochondrial ultrastructure, FH catabolic activity, invasiveness, optimal glucose requirements vitro growth. UOK 262 cells isochromosome 1q recurring chromosome abnormality, i(1)(q10), exhibit compromised oxidative phosphorylation vitro dependence anaerobic glycolysis consistent clinical manifestation HLRCC. cells also display glucose-dependent growth, elevated rate lactate efflux, overexpression glucose transporter GLUT1 lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA). Mutant FH protein present primarily edematous mitochondria, catalytic activity nearly undetectable. UOK 262 xenografts retain characteristics HLRCC histopathology. findings indicate severe compromise oxidative phosphorylation rapid glycolytic flux UOK 262 essential feature TCA cycle enzyme-deficient form kidney cancer. tumor model embodiment Warburg effect. UOK 262 provides unique vitro vivo preclinical model studying bioenergetics Warburg effect human cancer.
