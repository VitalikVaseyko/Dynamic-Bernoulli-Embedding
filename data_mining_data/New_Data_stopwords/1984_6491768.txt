 Pyruvate kinase activity rates gluconeogenesis glycolysis rat hepatocytes evaluated production glucose lactate + pyruvate dihydroxyacetone first 48 hours shift low protein, high carbohydrate diet high protein, carbohydrate-free diet. effect glucagon also studied. absence glucagon, 11-17 hours dietary shift glycogen lowest, gluconeogenesis maximal glycolysis minimal. concentration fructose 1,6-biphosphate high change experiment. activity ratio pyruvate kinase measured phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (V0.5 mM PEP/V4 mM PEP) high crude extracts low (NH4)2SO4-treated extracts, remained unchanged whole experiment. correlation rates gluconeogenesis glycolysis dihydroxyacetone activity ratio pyruvate kinase. glucagon, gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone increased concurrent decrease glycolysis paralleled decrease fructose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration activity ratio pyruvate kinase. activity ratio pyruvate kinase (NH4)2SO4-treated cells represented 50% absence hormone. difference may related glucagon-induced phosphorylation pyruvate kinase.
