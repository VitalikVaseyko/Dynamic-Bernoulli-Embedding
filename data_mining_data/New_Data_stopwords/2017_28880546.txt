 study, transcriptomic Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) underlined ex-vivo TCDD treatment (0.1 nM) stimulated insulin-release mouse pancreatic islets via effect Akt-mTOR-p70S6K, AMPK ERK1/2 pathways. Functional studies using ex-vivo islets mouse beta-cell-line (Min-6) validated stimulatory effects TCDD (0.1 1 nM) basal-insulin secretion. 0.1 nM TCDD treatment Min-6, Western blot analysis showed activation ERK1/2 decreased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). reduction PDK expression associated increase pyruvate dehydrogenase flux. observation supported detection significantly higher cellular ATP levels, increase glucose-stimulated-insulin-secretion (GSIS), inhibition AMPK pathway. 1 nM TCDD treatment Min-6, significant inhibitions Akt-mTOR pathway, cellular ATP production, GSIS evident. experimental studies Min-6 supported IPA transcriptomic data pancreatic islets. Collectively, TCDD treatment caused elevated basal-insulin release islets beta-cell cultures. Moreover, data revealed modulation Akt-mTOR-p70S6K, AMPK ERK1/2 pathways might important component mechanism TCDD-perturbing effects ATP production beta-cells affecting insulin secretion.
