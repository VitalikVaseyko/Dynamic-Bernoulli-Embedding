 Glycogenotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) glycogen-ground-glass hepatocytes recently described allegedly "novel variant" HCC, neither historical background heuristic relevance observation put perspective. present contribution, important findings animal models human beings related emergence evolution excessively glycogen storing (glycogenotic) hepatocytes without ground glass features neoplastic development summarized. Glycogenotic HCCs glycogen-ground-glass hepatocytes represent highly differentiated neoplasms contain subpopulations cells phenotypically resembling certain types preneoplastic hepatic foci benign hepatocellular neoplasms. questionable whether occurrence glycogen-ground-glass hepatocytes glycogenotic HCC justifies classification specific entity. typical appearance ground-glass hepatocytes due hypertrophy smooth endoplasmic reticulum, usually associated excessive storage glycogen frequently also expression hepatitis B surface antigen. Sequential studies animal models observations humans indicate glycogen-ground-glass hepatocytes facultative, integral part characteristic cellular sequence commencing focal hepatic glycogenosis potentially progressing benign malignant neoplasms. process highly differentiated glycogenotic cells including ground-glass hepatocytes gradually transformed via various intermediate stages poorly differentiated glycogen-poor, basophilic (ribosome-rich) cancer cells. Histochemical, microbiochemical, molecular biochemical studies focal hepatic glycogenosis advanced preneoplastic neoplastic lesions tissue sections laser-dissected specimens rat mouse models provided compelling evidence early insulinomimetic effect oncogenic agents, followed fundamental metabolic switch gluconeogenesis towards pentose-phosphate pathway Warburg type glycolysis progression preneoplastic hepatic glycogenosis highly proliferative malignant phenotype.
