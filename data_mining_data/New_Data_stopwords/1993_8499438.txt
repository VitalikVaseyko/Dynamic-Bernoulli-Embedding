 activity pyruvate kinase studied reverse micelles formed cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, n-octane, hexanol, various amounts water. systems 100% water, K+ essential activator pyruvate kinase [Kachmar, J. F., & Boyer, P. D. (1953) J. Biol. Chem. 200, 669-683]; i.e., without K+, activities observed 0.07 300 mumol/(min.mg), respectively. micellar system 3.6% water (v/v), pyruvate kinase exhibited activity 45 mumol/(min.mg), absence K+. kcat 450 times larger 100% water without K+. Km values ADP phosphoenolpyruvate differed, markedly 100% water without K+. kinetics pyruvate kinase reverse micelles affected K+. activity curve pyruvate kinase reverse micelles without K+ pH range 6.0-8.5 almost superimposable enzyme 100% water K+, differed drastically 100% water without K+. fluorescence emission spectra pyruvate kinase 100% water exhibited blue shift 3 nm upon addition ligands (Mg2+, phosphoenolpyruvate, K+) cause transition enzyme active state. Without ligands, entrapment pyruvate kinase reverse micelles 3.0% water produced blue shift nearly 2 nm respect enzyme 100% water without ligands. water raised 7.0% (v/v), maximal emission shifted longer wavelengths; changes paralleled appearance K(+)-dependent activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
