 Recently, nonaqueous fractionation method obtaining highly purified mesophyll chloroplasts maize leaves established. method used determine adenine nucleotide levels, redox states NADP system, Pi levels dihydroxyacetone phosphate/3-phosphoglycerate ratios mesophyll chloroplasts Zea mays L. leaves different light intensities. sum ATP, ADP, AMP levels estimated 1.4 millimolar ATP/ADP ratio 1 dark 2.5 4 light. adenine nucleotides equilibrated adenylate kinase. total concentration NADP(H) chloroplasts 0.3 millimolar dark 0.48 millimolar light. ratio NADPH/NADP 0.1 0.18 dark 0.23 0.48 light. Pi level estimated 20 millimolar dark 10 17 millimolar light. 3-phosphoglycerate reducing system thermodynamic equilibrium light. calculated assimilatory forces 8 per molar 40 170 per molar dark light, respectively. relationship degree activation pyruvate, Pi dikinase, adenylate energy charge, ATP/ADP ratio ADP level various light intensities. weak relationship found degree activation NADP-malate dehydrogenase NADPH/NADP ratio NADP(H) level increasing light intensity. possible regulatory mechanism responsible regulation activation pyruvate,Pi dikinase NADP-malate dehydrogenase discussed.
