 Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1C, brain-specific protein localized endoplasmic reticulum neurons, expressed almost brain regions. Based global knockout (KO) models, CPT1C demonstrated relevance hippocampus-dependent spatial learning hypothalamic regulation energy balance. Specifically, shown CPT1C protective high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO), CPT1C KO mice show reduced peripheral fatty acid oxidation (FAO) fasting DIO. However, mechanisms mediating CPT1C-dependent regulation energy homeostasis remain unclear. Here, focus mechanistic understanding hypothalamic CPT1C regulation fuel selection liver muscle male mice energy deprivation situations, fasting. CPT1C-deficient mice, modulation main hypothalamic energy sensors (5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, Sirtuin 1, mammalian target rapamycin) impaired plasma catecholamine levels decreased. Consequently, CPT1C-deficient mice presented defective fasting-induced FAO liver, leading higher triacylglycerol accumulation lower glycogen levels. Moreover, muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increased, indicative glycolysis enhancement. respiratory quotient decrease CPT1C KO mice 48 hours fasting, confirming defective switch fuel substrate selection hypoglycemia. Phenotype reversion studies identified mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) main area mediating CPT1C effects fuel selection. Overall, data demonstrate CPT1C MBH necessary proper hypothalamic sensing negative energy balance fuel partitioning liver muscle.
