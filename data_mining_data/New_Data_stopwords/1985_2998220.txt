 procedure determination picomole amounts glycerate 3-phosphate, glycerate 2-phosphate, phosphoenol pyruvate described. metabolites utilized glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase generate ATP determined firefly luciferase/luciferin luminescence. phosphoglycerate mutase used glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate-independent type prepared wheat germ. Stoichiometric conversion glycerate 3-P, ranging amount 9 275 pmol, occurred 25 min preincubation required narrow range added mutase. application procedure determining metabolites suspensions plant protoplasts described.
