 prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes regarded molecular oxygen sensors. interplay oxygen availability cellular metabolism, turn significant effects functionality innate immune cells, macrophages. However, PHD enzymes affect macrophage metabolism enigmatic. hypothesized macrophage metabolism function controlled via manipulation PHD2. characterized metabolic phenotypes PHD2-deficient RAW cells primary PHD2 knockout bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). showed typical features anaerobic glycolysis, paralleled increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) protein levels decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Metabolic alterations associated impaired cellular functionality. Inhibition PDK1 knockout hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) reversed metabolic phenotype impaired functionality PHD2-deficient RAW cells BMDM. Taking results together, identified critical role PHD2 reversible glycolytic reprogramming macrophages direct impact function. suggest PHD2 serves adjustable switch control macrophage behavior.
