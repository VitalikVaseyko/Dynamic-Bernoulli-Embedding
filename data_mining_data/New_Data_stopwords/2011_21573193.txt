 BACKGROUND: Human cancers consume larger amounts glucose compared normal tissues converted excreted lactate despite abundant oxygen availability (Warburg effect). underlying higher rate glycolysis therefore root tumor formation growth. Normal control glycolytic allosteric enzymes appears impaired tumors; however, phenomenon fully resolved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: present paper, show evidence native 85-kDa 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), key regulatory enzyme glycolysis normally control feedback inhibition, undergoes posttranslational modification. proteolytic cleavage C-terminal portion enzyme, active, shorter 47-kDa fragment formed insensitive citrate ATP inhibition. tumorigenic cell lines, short fragments native 85-kDa PFK1 detected immunoblotting. Similar fragments detected also tumor tissue developed mice subcutaneous infection tumorigenic B16-F10 cells. Based limited proteolytic digestion rabbit muscle PFK-M, active citrate inhibition-resistant shorter form obtained, indicating single posttranslational modification step possible. exact molecular masses active shorter PFK1 fragments determined inserting truncated genes constructed human muscle PFK1 cDNA pfk null E. coli strain. Two E. coli transformants encoding modified PFK1s 45,551 Da 47,835 Da grew glucose medium. insertion modified truncated human pfkM genes also stimulated glucose consumption lactate excretion stable transfectants non-tumorigenic human HEK cell, suggesting important role shorter PFK1 fragments enhancing glycolytic flux. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Posttranslational modification PFK1 enzyme might pivotal factor deregulated glycolytic flux tumors combination altered signaling mechanisms essentially supports fast proliferation cancer cells.
