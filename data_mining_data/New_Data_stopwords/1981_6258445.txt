 effects diabetes hepatic carbohydrate metabolism investigated spontaneously diabetic Bio-Breeding Worcester (BB/W) rats. juvenile-onset-type syndrome displayed animals characterized beta-cell destruction subsequent ketosis-prone insulinopenia. Livers diabetic animals demonstrated increased adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels subnormal total protein glycogen content. Isolated perfused livers diabetic BB/W rats demonstrated increased rate glucose production [14C]lactate impaired rate glycogen synthesis. data consonant hepatic enzyme studies demonstrating markedly increased activities component gluconeogenic (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) glycogenolytic (glycogen phosphorylase) enzymes decreased activities glycolytic (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase) glycogenic (glycogen synthase) enzymes. findings agree previous studies using alloxan- streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals suggest accelerated hepatic gluconeogenesis impaired glucose utilization pathognomonic insulin-deficient diabetic syndromes.
