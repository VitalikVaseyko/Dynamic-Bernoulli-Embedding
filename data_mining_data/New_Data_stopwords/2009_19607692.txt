 BACKGROUND: Development type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) characterized aberrant insulin secretory patterns, elevated insulin levels non-stimulatory basal conditions reduced hormonal levels stimulatory conditions major components. delineate mechanisms responsible alterations cultured INS-1E cells 48 hours 20 mM glucose absence presence 0.5 mM palmitate, stimulatory secretion insulin reduced basal secretion elevated, respectively. RESULTS: culture, cells protein profiled SELDI-TOF-MS 2D-PAGE. Differentially expressed proteins discovered identified peptide mass fingerprinting. Complimentary protein profiles obtained two approaches SELDI-TOF-MS efficient separating proteins low molecular range 2D-PAGE high molecular range. Identified proteins included alpha glucosidase, calmodulin, gars, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A3, lon peptidase, nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, proteasome p45, rab2, pyruvate kinase t-complex protein. observed glucose-induced differential protein expression pattern indicates enhanced glucose metabolism, defense reactive oxygen species, enhanced protein translation, folding degradation decreased insulin granular formation trafficking. Palmitate-induced changes could related altered exocytosis. CONCLUSION: identified altered proteins indicate mechanism important altered beta-cell function T2DM.
