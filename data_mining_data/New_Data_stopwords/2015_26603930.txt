 Brain exceptional high requirement energy metabolism glucose exclusive energy source. Decrease brain energy metabolism glucose uptake found patients Alzheimer's, Parkinson's neurodegenerative diseases, providing clear link neurodegenerative disorders energy metabolism. hand, cancers, including glioblastoma, increased glucose uptake rely aerobic glycolysis energy metabolism. switch high efficient oxidative phosphorylation low efficient aerobic glycolysis pathway (Warburg effect) provides macromolecule biosynthesis proliferation. Current research indicates methylene blue, century old drug, receive electron NADH presence complex donates cytochrome c, providing alternative electron transfer pathway. Methylene blue increases oxygen consumption, decrease glycolysis, increases glucose uptake vitro. Methylene blue enhances glucose uptake regional cerebral blood flow rats upon acute treatment. addition, methylene blue provides protective effect neuron astrocyte various insults vitro rodent models Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease. glioblastoma cells, methylene blue reverses Warburg effect enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, arrests glioma cell cycle s-phase, inhibits glioma cell proliferation. Accordingly, methylene blue activates AMP-activated protein kinase, inhibits downstream acetyl-coA carboxylase cyclin-dependent kinases. summary, accumulating evidence providing proof concept enhancement mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation via alternative mitochondrial electron transfer may offer protective action neurodegenerative diseases inhibit cancers proliferation.
