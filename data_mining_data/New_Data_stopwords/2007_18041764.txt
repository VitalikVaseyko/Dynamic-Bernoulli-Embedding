 prostate-apoptosis-response-gene-4 (Par-4) protein shown function effector cell death response various apoptotic stimuli trigger mitochondria membrane receptor-mediated cell death pathways. found overexpressing Par-4 stable transfection sensitizes Caki cells induction apoptosis TRAIL drugs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TU) etoposide]. Ectopic expression Par-4 associated decreased levels XIAP protein TG-treated cells, caused part XIAP protein instability caspase activation. Levels phospho-Akt decreased Caki/Par-4 cells significantly greater extent Caki/Vector cells treatment TG, turn associated decreased levels phospho-PDK1, kinase upstream Akt. conclusion, provide evidence ectopic expression Par-4 sensitizes Caki cells TG XIAP protein instability inactivation Akt important cellular pathways affected Par-4.
