 method relies subtractive tissue-directed shot-gun proteomics identify tumor proteins blood patient newly diagnosed cancer described. avoid analytical statistical biases caused physiologic variability protein expression human population, method applied clinical specimens obtained single patient diagnosed nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). proteomes extracted tumor, normal adjacent tissue preoperative plasma analyzed using 2D-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). lists identified proteins filtered discover proteins (i) found tumor normal tissue, (ii) identified matching plasma, (iii) whose spectral count higher tumor tissue plasma. filtering criteria resulted identification eight tumor proteins blood. Subsequent Western-blot analysis confirmed presence cadherin-5, cadherin-11, DEAD-box protein-23, pyruvate kinase blood patient study well blood four patients diagnosed RCC. results demonstrate utility combined blood/tissue analysis strategy permits detection tumor proteins blood patient diagnosed RCC.
