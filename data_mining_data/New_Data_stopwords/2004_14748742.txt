 present ribozyme-based strategy studying effects Bcl2 down-regulation. anti-bcl2 hammerhead ribozyme Rz-bcl2 stably transfected MCF7 cancer cells cleavage Bcl2 mRNA demonstrated using new assay cleavage product detection, Western blot analysis showed concomitant depletion Bcl2 protein. Rz-bcl2-expressing cells sensitive staurosporine control cells. Moreover, molecular cellular read-outs indicated staurosporine-induced cell death necrosis rather apoptosis cells. study effects Bcl2 down-regulation extended global MCF7 protein expression profile, exploiting proteomic approach. Two reference electro-pherograms Rz-bcl2-transfected cells, one ribozyme catalytically active form ribozyme catalytically inactive form, obtained. comparing two-dimensional maps, 53 differentially expressed spots found, four identified MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight) MS calreticulin, nucleophosmin, phosphoglycerate kinase pyruvate kinase. up-regulation proteins might help explain modification Bcl2 activity discussed.
