 randomized, double-blind crossover design, investigated effect beta2-agonist terbutaline (TER) endurance performance substrate utilization nine moderately trained men [maximum oxygen uptake (VO(2 max)) 58.9 +/- 3.1 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)]. Subjects performed 60 min submaximal exercise (65-70% VO(2 max)) immediately followed 300-kcal time trial inhalation either 15 mg TER placebo (PLA). Pulmonary gas exchange measured submaximal exercise, muscle biopsies collected exercise bouts. Time trial performance different TER PLA (1,072 +/- 145 vs. 1,054 +/- 125 s). submaximal exercise, respiratory exchange ratio, glycogen breakdown (TER 266 +/- 32, PLA 195 +/- 28 mmol/kg dw), muscle lactate accumulation (TER 20.3 +/- 1.6, PLA 13.2 +/- 1.2 mmol/kg dw) higher (P < 0.05) TER PLA. difference TER PLA net muscle glycogen utilization lactate accumulation time trial. Intramyocellular triacylglycerol content change treatment exercise. Pyruvate dehydrogenase-E1alpha phosphorylation Ser(293) Ser(300) lower (P < 0.05) submaximal exercise TER PLA, difference submaximal exercise time trial. submaximal exercise, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) phosphorylation Ser(221) higher (P < 0.05) TER PLA. difference phosphorylation alpha 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (alphaAMPK) Thr(172) treatments. present study suggests beta2-agonists enhance 300-kcal time trial performance, increase carbohydrate metabolism skeletal muscles submaximal exercise independent AMPK ACC phosphorylation, effect diminishes drug exposure time, exercise duration, intensity increased.
