 aims present study describe possible correlation regulation key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase acid-base status haemolymph several tissues land snails anoxia. illustrate whether relationship exists, determined (i) acid-base variables haemolymph tissues land snail Helix lucorum, (ii) kinetic properties pyruvate kinase several tissues (iii) levels anaerobic end-products d-lactate succinate haemolymph tissues aerobic anoxic Helix lucorum. results showed pH haemolymph (pHe) decreased significantly first 20 h anoxia recovered slowly towards control values. similar pattern observed intracellular pH (pHi), decreased significantly first 16 h anoxia slowly returned towards control levels. reduction recovery pHi pHe seem reflect rate anaerobic metabolism. main anaerobic end-products, d-lactate succinate, accumulated rapidly initial stages anoxia slowly anoxia progressed. decrease rate accumulation anaerobic end-products prolonged anoxia due conversion tissue pyruvate kinase less active form. results demonstrate correlation pyruvate kinase down-regulation recovery acid-base status haemolymph tissues land snails anoxia.
