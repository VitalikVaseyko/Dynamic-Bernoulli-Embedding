 BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis neglected tropical disease affects approx. 12 million individuals worldwide caused parasite Leishmania. current drugs used treatment Leishmaniasis highly toxic seen widespread emergence drug resistant strains necessitates need development new therapeutic options. high throughput screen data available made possible generate computational predictive models ability assess active scaffolds chemical library followed ADME/toxicity properties biological trials. RESULTS: present study, used publicly available, high-throughput screen datasets chemical moieties adjudged target pyruvate kinase enzyme L. mexicana (LmPK). machine learning approach used create computational models capable predicting biological activity novel antileishmanial compounds. Further, evaluated molecules using substructure based approach identify common substructures contributing activity. CONCLUSION: generated computational models based machine learning methods evaluated performance models based various statistical figures merit. Random forest based approach determined sensitive, better accuracy well ROC. added substructure based approach analyze molecules identify potentially enriched substructures active dataset. believe models developed present study would lead reduction cost length clinical studies hence newer drugs would appear faster market providing better healthcare options patients.
