 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pyruvate kinase (PK) key enzyme glycolysis. Different isoforms enzyme tissue-specifically expressed (M2-PK, M1-PK, R-PK, L-PK). concentration dimeric M2-PK increased metabolic state tumor cells. case, dimeric M2-PK termed Tumor M2-PK. investigated EDTA-plasma 73 patients gastrointestinal (GI) cancer 61 healthy controls evaluate significance diagnosing GI cancer. METHODS: Plasma Tumor M2-PK measured using ELISA assay based two monoclonal antibodies specifically react dimeric Tumor M2-PK. RESULTS: sensitivity Tumor M2-PK 67.1% GI cancers, CA 19-9 38.4% CEA 34.3%. specificity Tumor M2-PK 91.8% (cutoff=20 U/mL). Tumor M2-PK showed high sensitivity gastric cancer (62.2%), colorectal cancer (66.7%) bile duct cancer (75.0%). colorectal cancer, combination Tumor M2-PK CEA resulted remarkable increase sensitivity (86.2%). average Tumor M2-PK levels generally elevated metastatic GI cancer patients compared nonmetastatic patients, especially stomach cancer statistical significance (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor M2-PK EDTA-plasma seems new valuable tumor marker GI cancer.
