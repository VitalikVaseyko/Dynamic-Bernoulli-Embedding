 Preparations purified disrupted suspensions Coxiella burnetii able incorporate ribonucleotides polymers presence adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine triphosphates. Nucleotide incorporation requires presence four ribonucleoside triphosphates. reaction enhanced addition phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvic kinase, exogenous deoxyribonucleic acid, inhibited deoxyribonuclease actinomycin D. Incorporation maximal pH 7.0 8.0, 37 C. synthesized polymer relatively insensitive deoxyribonuclease sensitive ribonuclease dilute alkaline hydrolysis. data indicate presence autonomous deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase rickettsial agent.
