 BACKGROUND: Glucose metabolism studied vitro variety means, also fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). example potential use compared high glucose consumption cancer cells transformed non-malignant foetal cells. high glucose metabolism cancer cells primarily production energy, large proportion transformed lactate only, producing two instead potentially 32 ATP equivalents. secreted lactate reduces pH local microenvironment gives malignant cells, apt thrive hypoxic acid environments, competitive advantage. PURPOSE: demonstrate use FDG head-to-head comparison glucose uptake lactate production highly malignant highly proliferative non-malignant cell line. MATERIALS METHODS: Cell cultures foetal kidney cell line triple negative breast cancer cell line incubated FDG one hour, washed, harvested radioactivity content cells measured well counter. lactate concentration measured conditioned medium. RESULTS: FDG uptake consistently higher non-malignant foetal cell line. levels lactate conditioned medium similar. CONCLUSION: Quantitative comparison glucose metabolism vitro use FDG practical, cheap rapid method. foetal cells higher glucose uptake produce much lactate highly malignant cell line. argument high glucose consumption related solely malignancy.
