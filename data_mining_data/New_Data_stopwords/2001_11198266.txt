 Lung cancer one predominant causes cancer death. aim project development screening method persons high risk developing lung cancer, based measurement Tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (Tumor M2-PK). Tumor M2-PK quantitatively detectable ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-plasma sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. far, 60 patients newly diagnosed lung cancer included. compared 24 patients acute inflammatory lung diseases, 56 patients pneumoconiosis, 22 patients obstructive airway diseases, 28 healthy persons. Tumor patients individuals suffering severe inflammatory lung diseases significantly higher Tumor M2-PK concentrations ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-plasma groups. histologic tumor type influence plasma levels Tumor M2-PK. Tumor M2-PK concentrations correlate strongly tumor stage, showing significantly increasing concentrations progressive tumor stages. present data indicate Tumor M2-PK could valuable tumor marker detection lung cancer.
