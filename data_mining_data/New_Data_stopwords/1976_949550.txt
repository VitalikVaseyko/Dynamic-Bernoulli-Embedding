 Alkylureas capable inhibiting sickling vitro gelation solutions hemoglobin concentrations 0.05 0.1 increasing effectiveness directly proportional length alkyl chain (butyl greater propyl greater ethyl greater methyl). 6The inhibitory effect independent pH 6.5 7.5 process driven entropy. alkylureas concentrations 0.1 minimal effects several erythrocyte functions. Oxygen equilibria, osmotic fragility, reduced glutathione content, glutathione reductase activity totally unaffected, pyruvic kinase activity decreased butylurea 20%, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity decreased progressively maximum 30% direct proportion length alkyl chain. Alkylureas inhibit sickling also capable desickling erythrocytes maintained deoxygenated state. little effect several erythrocyte functions antisickling concentrations, toxicity must evaluated examined potential therapeutic agents treatment prevention acute episodes sickle cell anemia.
