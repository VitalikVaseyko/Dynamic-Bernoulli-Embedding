 c-Myc (hereafter called Myc) belongs family transcription factors regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, differentiation. Myc initiates transcription large cast genes involved cell growth stimulating metabolism protein synthesis. these, like involved glycolysis, may part Warburg effect, defined increased glucose uptake lactate production presence adequate oxygen supply. study, taken mouse-genetics approach challenge role select Myc-regulated metabolic enzymes tumorigenesis vivo. breeding lambda-Myc transgenic mice, Apc(Min) mice, p53 knockout mice mouse models carrying inactivating alleles Lactate dehydrogenase (Ldha), 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (Shmt1), obtained offspring monitored tumor development. surprisingly, found genes dispensable tumorigenesis genetic settings. However, experiments fibroblasts colon carcinoma cells expressing oncogenic Ras show cells sensitive Ldha knockdown. genetic models reveal cell context dependency remarkable ability tumor cells adapt alterations critical metabolic pathways. Thus, achieve clinical success, importance correctly stratify patients find synthetic lethal combinations inhibitors targeting metabolic enzymes.
