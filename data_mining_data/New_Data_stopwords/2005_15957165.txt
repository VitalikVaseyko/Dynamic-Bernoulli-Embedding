 Proliferating cells express pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK). enzyme exists active tetramer inactive dimer. dimeric form predominantly found tumor cells therefore termed Tumor M2-PK (TuM2-PK). TuM2-PK molecules released peripheral blood may hereby function marker tumor load cancer patients. study aimed investigate TuM2-PK potential plasma marker melanoma patients compared well-established serum marker S100beta. measured concentration TuM2-PK plasma S100beta corresponding serum samples 300 melanoma patients 53 healthy controls using sandwich ELISA immunoluminometric assay, respectively. Plasma concentrations TuM2-PK significantly increased melanoma patients compared healthy controls (9.30 U/ml vs. 7.20 U/ml; p = 0.0036) correlated tumor load (p < 0.0005) disease stage (p < 0.0005). Patients elevated plasma TuM2-PK (cut-off = 15 U/ml) presented reduced overall (p < 0.000005) progression-free (p = 0.023) survival. Multivariate analysis revealed plasma TuM2-PK serum S100beta independent predictors overall survival metastasized patients. Neither plasma TuM2-PK serum S100beta showed prognostic relevance tumor-free patients. Although sensitivity specificity predict disease progression death higher serum S100beta compared plasma TuM2-PK, combination markers improved estimation prognosis compared serum S100beta alone.
