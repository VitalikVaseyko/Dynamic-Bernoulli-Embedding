 Human red cells manifest glycolate kinase activity. activity copurifies pyruvate kinase decreased red cells subjects hereditary pyruvate kinase deficiency. Glycolate kinase activity detected presence FDP glucose-1,6-P2. presence 1 mmol/L FDP, Km adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 0.28 mmol/L half maximum velocity glycolate obtained 40 mmol/L. pH optimum reaction 10.5 10 mumol/L FDP, 500 mumol/L glucose-1,6-P2, 2 mmol/L ATP, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 mmol/L glycolate pH 7.5, glycolate kinase activity calculated approximately 0.0013 U/mL RBC. view low activity even presence massive amounts glycolate, glycolate kinase reaction cannot account maintenance reported phosphoglycolate level human red cells.
