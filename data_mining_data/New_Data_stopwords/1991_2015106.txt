 vitro treatment normal, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient pyruvate kinase-deficient human erythrocytes three different oxidizing agents, extent lipid peroxidative degradation alterations membrane proteins evaluated. Exposure tert-butylhydroperoxide induced, markedly G6PD- PK-deficient erythrocytes, reduction protein bands 1, 2, 2.1, 3, 4.1, 4.2, 5, appearance high-molecular-weight aggregates "new" polypeptide components 29- 23-kDa region marked increase membrane-bound globin. Malonyldialdehyde production highest G6PD-deficient cells relatively low PK-deficient ones. Methylene blue, similar less relevant effects lipid peroxidation, G6PD-deficient erythrocytes caused conspicuous appearance high-molecular-weight aggregates simultaneous relevant decrease bands 1 2 membrane-bound globin; brought almost opposite effect PK-deficient red cells. Acetylphenylhydrazine, conditions appeared mildest agent, failed, normal PK-deficient erythrocytes, increase malonyldialdehyde production alter membrane proteins, whereas caused, G6PD-deficient cells, slight decrease bands 1 2, pronounced decrease band 3, marked increase bands 4.5 4.9.
