 Protein phosphorylation patterns investigated whole tissues subcellular fractions active aestivating Otala lactea (Muller) (Pulmonata, Helicidae). Measurement overall protein phosphorylation showed incorporation 32P increased second day injection remained constant remaining 4 days time course. Comparison tissues aestivating active snails day 3 showed decreased protein phosphorylation aestivating snails (44% active). differences total protein-associated radioactivity foot, mantle haemolymph observed. Subcellular fractionation hepatopancreas localized changes plasma membrane, microsomal, cytosolic fractions: values aestivating animals reduced 71, 37 58% corresponding active values. Separation individual subcellular fractions isoelectric focusing columns revealed differences phosphate incorporation patterns. Plasma membrane aestivating animal hepatopancreas lower overall level incorporation fewer radioactive peaks pH 7-10 region plasma membrane fraction active animals. SDS-PAGE analysis plasma membrane fractions active aestivating snails showed relative decrease phosphorylation 60-80 kDa 30-40 kDa. IEF analysis cytosolic proteins aestivating snail hepatopancreas also showed peaks radioactivity apparently shifted 0.3 pH units toward higher pI values. Increased phosphate incorporation observed peak corresponded pI value pyruvate kinase aestivating snails definite assignment peaks possible. SDS-PAGE analysis cytosolic proteins showed aestivation-related decrease relative protein phosphorylation 30-35 kDa 40-45 kDa. relative increase phosphorylation aestivation observed proteins 16-22 kDa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
