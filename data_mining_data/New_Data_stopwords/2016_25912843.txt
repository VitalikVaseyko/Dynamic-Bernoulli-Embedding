 BACKGROUND: Cholangiocellular carcinoma characterized elevated glucose consumption, resulting increased uptake 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (18F-FDG). study investigates relationship 18F-FDG uptake tumour glucose metabolism. METHODS: retrospective analysis 19 patients cholangiocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry glucose transporter 1 pyruvate kinase type M2 performed. Overall tumour glucose metabolism evaluated measuring 18F-FDG uptake protein expression levels glucose transporter 1 pyruvate kinase type M2. RESULTS: 18F-FDG uptake strong positive correlation histological differentiation. tumour status (p=0.044) tumour size (p=0.011) correlated primary tumour 18F-FDG uptake. Glucose transporter 1 expression correlated histological differentiation (p=0.017), pyruvate kinase type M2 expression tended correlate lymph node metastasis (p=0.051). Glucose transporter 1 expression strongly related standard uptake value (p=0.001), pyruvate kinase type M2 (p=0.461). CONCLUSIONS: Glucose transporter 1 expression exhibits strong correlation 18F-FDG uptake cholangiocellular carcinoma tissue, pyruvate kinase type M2 expression associated fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake. addition glycolytic function, pyruvate kinase type M2 variety roles expression may enhance tumour cell invasion promote lymph node metastasis intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
