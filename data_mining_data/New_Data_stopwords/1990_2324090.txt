 Primer recognition proteins (PRP) cofactors DNA polymerase alpha may role lagging strand DNA replication. Purified PRP HeLa cells human placenta composed two subunits 36,000 (PRP 1) 41,000 (PRP 2) daltons. Upon tryptic digestion, amino acid sequencing tryptic peptides, homology search protein sequence data base, identified PRP 2 glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). activities PRP PGK increase coordinately PRP purification procedure. PRP activity inhibited PGK substrate 3-phosphoglycerate competitive inhibitor substrate binding, DL-alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate. 5'-p-Fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine, inactivates PGK binding nucleotide binding site, also inhibits PRP. PRP activity, two substrate binding sites PGK necessary addition yet unidentified PRP 1 polypeptide.
