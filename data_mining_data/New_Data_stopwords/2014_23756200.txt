 recently synthesized new series 4,5-dihydrobenzo-oxa-cycloheptapyrazole derivatives aim discover novel CB1 antagonist agents characterized anti-obesity activity comparable SR141716A reduced adverse effects anxiety depression. Within novel class, CB1 antagonist 8-chloro-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-piperidin-1-yl-4,5-dihydrobenzo-1H-6-oxa-cycloh epta(1,2-c)pyrazole-3-carboxamide (NESS06SM) selected lead compound. found NESS06SM CB1 neutral antagonist, characterized poor blood-brain barrier permeability. Moreover, NESS06SM chronic treatment determined anti-obesity effect cardiovascular risk factor improvement C57BL/6N Diet Induced Obesity (DIO) mice fed fat diet (FD mice). fact, mRNA gene expression Central Nervous System (CNS) peripheral tissues real time PCR, showed significant increase orexigenic peptides decrease anorexigenic peptides elicited NESS06SM treatment, compared control mice fed diet. Moreover, contrast SR141716A treatment, chronic administration NESS06SM change mRNA expression monoaminergic transporters neurotrophins highly related anxiety mood disorders. results suggest NESS06SM reduces body weight restore disrupted expression profile genes linked hunger-satiety circuit without altering monoaminergic transmission probably avoiding SR141716A side effects. Therefore novel CB1 neutral antagonist could represent useful candidate agent treatment obesity metabolic complications.
