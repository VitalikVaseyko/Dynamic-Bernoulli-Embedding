 objective study investigate impact elevated tissue omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) status age-related glucose intolerance utilizing fat-1 transgenic mouse model, endogenously synthesize n-3 PUFA omega-6 (n-6) PUFA. Fat-1 wild-type mice, maintained dietary regime 10% corn oil diet, tested two different ages (2 months old 8 months old) various glucose homeostasis parameters related gene expression. older wild-type mice exhibited significantly increased levels blood insulin, fasting blood glucose, liver triglycerides, glucose intolerance, compared younger mice, indicating age-related impairment glucose homeostasis. contrast, age-related changes glucose metabolism largely prevented older fat-1 mice. Compared older wild-type mice, older fat-1 mice also displayed lower capacity gluconeogenesis, measured pyruvate tolerance testing (PTT) hepatic gene expression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase). Furthermore, older fat-1 mice showed significant decrease body weight, epididymal fat mass, inflammatory activity (NFkappa-B p-IkappaB expression), hepatic lipogenesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression), well increased peroxisomal activity (70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70) acyl-CoA oxidase1 (ACOX1) expression). Altogether, older fat-1 mice exhibit improved glucose homeostasis comparison older wild-type mice. findings support beneficial effects elevated tissue n-3 fatty acid status prevention treatment age-related chronic metabolic diseases.
