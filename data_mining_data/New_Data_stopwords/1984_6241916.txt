 Activities key enzymes hepatic glucose utilization compared obese (C57BL/6J ob/ob) mice, lean controls outbred Swiss albino mice fed condition fasting. liver hyperplasia hepatocyte hypertrophy present ob/ob mice 4-5 months age changes hepatic cellularity occur fasting, enzyme activity expressed basis protein, DNA, wet weight. fed state, activities glucokinase + hexokinase (glucose phosphorylating capability), phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase significantly greater livers ob/ob mice compared lean control. Glucokinase + hexokinase activities livers ob/ob mice remained significantly higher throughout 48 h fast yet activities hepatic phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, expressed per g wet wt mg protein, decreased statistical difference fasted lean control longer detected. expressed per 100 g body weight, hepatic glucokinase + hexokinase well phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activities obese mice higher fed fasted states compared lean controls comparable nutritional condition. increased capacity key enzyme activities hepatic glucose utilization attributed liver hyperplasia found ob/ob mice fed fasted condition. higher hepatic glucose phosphorylating capability maintained fasting, elevated specific activities hepatic phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase obese mouse fed state decreased starvation values found lean control.
