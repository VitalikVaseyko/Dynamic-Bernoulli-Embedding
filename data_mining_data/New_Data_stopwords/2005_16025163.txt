 minireview main mechanism control mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) activity phosphorylation-dephosphorylation presented first place. information recently obtained several laboratories includes new data isoforms PDH converting enzymes (kinase phosphatase) action view short-term regulation PDHC. Moreover, interesting influence exogenous thiamine diphosphate (TDP) divalent cations, especially Mn(2+), kinetic parameters PDHC saturated endogenous tightly bound TDP, discussed. influence causes shortening lag-phase catalyzed reaction strong decrease K(m) value PDHC mainly pyruvate. weighty arguments effects allosteric nature. Thus, besides reversible phosphorylation, also direct manifold increase mammalian PDHC affinity substrate cofactors seems important aspect regulation.
