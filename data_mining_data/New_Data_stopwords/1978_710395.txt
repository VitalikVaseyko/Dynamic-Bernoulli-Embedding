 1. Measurements made activities enzymes glycolytic route, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle lipogenesis liver adipose tissue genetically obese (fa/fa) rats lean litter mates (fa/ --). effect food restriction period three weeks enzyme profile liver adipose tissue obese rat also studied. 2. striking increases enzyme activity livers obese rats were: (a) among enzymes lipogenesis; ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) cytoplasmic glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase; (b) within pentose phosphate pathway; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; (c) within glycolytic pathway; glucokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. enzymes showed significant increase activity basis U/g liver U/mg DNA. adipose tissue enzymes lipogenesis, glycolytic route, oxidative segment pentose phosphate pathway tricarboxylic acid cycle increased expressed U/2 fat pads U/mg DNA. 3. restriction food intake obese rats consumed lean litter mates periods three weeks produce expected adaptive decrease enzymes lipogenesis; adipose tissue, ATP-citrate lyase malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) showed marked decrease; significant change found adipose tissue liver activities acetyl-CoA carboxylase fatty acid synthetase, expressed cell basis (U/mg DNA). non-oxidative enzymes pentose phosphate pathway enzymes involved glycerogenesis (pyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) increased adipose tissue limit-fed obese rats. 4. rate conversion specifically labelled glucose (14C)O2 14C-labelled lipid pieces adipose tissue liver slices also measured. Insulin caused increase conversion (1-14C)glucose (14C)O2 14C-labelled lipid obese rats fed ad libitum, limit-fed rats lean litter mates. 5. results discussed relation raised insulin hypothyroid state obese rat. effect altered hormonal status activity cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases cellular levels adenosine 3' :5'-monophosphate guanosine 3' :5'-monophosphate guanosine 3' :5'-monophosphate relation obese syndrome considered.
