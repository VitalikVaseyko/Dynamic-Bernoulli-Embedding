 mononuclear cells newborn infants compared normal adults contain diminished activity pyruvate kinase (PK) (14.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 22.3 +/- 1.3 mumol/10(10) cells/min) phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (195 +/- 10 vs. 415 +/- 19). deficiencies accentuated cells premature infants (4.9 +/- 0,5 71 +/- 15, respectively) accompanied reduced activity adenylate kinase (AK) (14.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 33.6 +/- 2.6). activities AK PGK adult neonatal mononuclear cells stimulated phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Although PK activity adult cells stimulated PHA, PK activity neonatal cells not. Mononuclear cell glycolysis stimulated PHA adults neonates. mean lactate production neonatal cells slightly lower adult cells (93 vs. 110 mumol/10(10) cells/hr, unstimulated, 151 vs. 181, stimulated), differences statistically significant. ATP content neonatal cells (3.8 +/- 0.4 mumol/ 10(10) cells) reduced compared adult values (6.0 +/- 0.3). Lactate production directly correlated PK activity adult neonatal mononuclear cells. Neonatal mononuclear cell PK activity increases adult levels first year life.
