 describe interesting novel alternative conventional immunoassay techniques measurement antigens antibodies body fluids. label used assays pyruvate kinase-IgG conjugate relevant second (species-specific) antibody. assays follow principle solid phase antigen used adsorb unreacted first (substance-specific) antibody following conventional antibody-antigen reaction liquid phase. washing, solid phase antigen-first antibody allowed react labelled second antibody. solid phase washed pyruvate kinase bound solid phase used generate ATP measured kinetically luminometer. Assays described insulin, insulin antibodies gentamicin demonstrate versatility sensitivity type assay. insulin assay lower detection limit 0.25 microU per tube comparable radioimmunoassay used routine purposes sensitivity reproducibility. insulin antibody assay correlated well radiometric determination used routinely laboratory. gentamicin assay correlated well routine commercial radioimmunoassay also comparable coefficients variation. cases, inter- intra-assay variation 10% range interest.
