 energy metabolism English E-CMO strain contagious equine metritis bacterium studied whole cells cell extracts. bacterium appears active Krebs cycle probably obtains energy oxidative phosphorylation since glycolysis hexose monophosphate pathways appear absent. conclusions based findings [U-14C]glucose incorporation bacterium level detection, respiration stimulated Krebs cycle intermediates (i.e., malate, citrate, succinate), glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose. Furthermore, support comes fact enzymes generally associated Krebs cycle electron transport (i.e., malate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, malate dehydrogenase [decarboxylating], cytochrome oxidase, superoxide dismutase, NADH dehydrogenase, catalase) detected. enzymes normally associated glycolysis hexose monophosphate pathways (i.e., hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose biphosphate aldolase, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphate acetyl transferase, acetate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase) level detection.
