 Specific fluorescent probes used monitor changes erythrocyte membranes first stages hemolytic process induced irradiation visible light presence protoporphyrin IX. Although change, even slight increase fluorescence anisotropy, occurred two probes preferential binding membrane proteins, fluorescamine 3-pyrene maleimide, fluorescence anisotropy two lipophilic probes, namely diphenyl-hexatriene anilino-naphthalene sulfonate, underwent substantial decrease upon irradiation. Concomitantly, dramatic decrease ATPase activity increase thiobarbituric-reacting substances observed erythrocyte membranes. Instead, effect activities intracellular enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. findings consistent hypothesis protoporphyrin-sensitized irradiation induces, primarily erythrocyte membrane, peroxidation lipid component, results increase fluidity bilayer. Hemolysis eventually occurs osmotic imbalance resulting combination increased passive diffusion decreased active ion transport.
