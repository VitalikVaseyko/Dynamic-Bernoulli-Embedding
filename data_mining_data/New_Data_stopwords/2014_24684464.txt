 CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE: aim study evaluate regulation fuel partitioning energy metabolism skeletal muscle lipid overfeeding healthy men. Design/Participants/Intervention: Thirty-nine healthy volunteers overfed 56 days high-fat diet (3180 kJ/d). Energy metabolism (indirect calorimetry) characterized fasting state test meal end diet. Skeletal muscle biopsies taken day 0 day 56. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change gene expression, mitochondrial respiration, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) content, acetylation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) skeletal muscle measured. RESULTS: Overfeeding increased body weight (+2.6 kg) fat mass concomitantly shift use substrates energy fuel toward preferential oxidation carbohydrates instead lipids. Changes lipid metabolic gene expression supported observation, reduction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression could consequences decreased NAD(+) concentration reduced deacetylase activity sirtuins, supported hyperacetylation PGC-1alpha overfeeding. Interestingly, reduction sirtuin PGC-1alpha pathway associated increased mitochondrial gene expression higher respiration rate conditions. CONCLUSION: Adaptation lipid overfeeding regulation fuel partitioning human muscle appear rely dissociation regulatory functions sirtuin-PGC-1alpha pathway fatty acid oxidation mitochondrial regulation. may facilitate lipid storage period positive energy balance maintaining mitochondrial functions oxidative capacities.
