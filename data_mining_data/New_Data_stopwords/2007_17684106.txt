 Maternal diabetes associated increased risk miscarriages congenital anomalies. Preovulatory oocytes murine models also experience maturational delay greater granulosa cell apoptosis. objective study examine whether maternal diabetes influences preovulatory oocyte metabolism impacts meiotic maturation. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic B6SJLF1 mice superovulated, oocytes collected 0, 2, 6 h human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection. Individual oocyte concentrations ATP, 5'-AMP, glycogen, fructose-1,6-phosphate (FBP) enzyme activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), adenylate kinase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hadh2), glutamic pyruvate transaminase (Gpt2) measured. Protein levels phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) also measured. ATP levels significantly lower oocytes diabetic mice, percent change AMP-to-ATP ratio significantly higher oocytes. contrast, activities Hadh2 Gpt2, two enzymes activated AMPK, significantly less oocytes. Additionally, glycogen FBP levels, endogenous inhibitors AMPK, elevated. Phosphorylated ACC, downstream target AMPK, phosphorylated AMPK decreased diabetic oocytes, thus confirming decreased AMPK activity. Finally, addition activator AICAR vitro maturation assay restored AMPK activity corrected maturation defect experienced oocytes diabetic mice. conclusion, maternal diabetes adversely alters cellular metabolism leading abnormal AMPK activity murine oocytes. Increasing AMPK activity oocytes preovulatory phase reverses metabolic changes corrects delays meiotic maturation.
