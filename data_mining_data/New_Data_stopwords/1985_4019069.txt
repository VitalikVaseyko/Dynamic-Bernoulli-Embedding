 resorption-gestation test furnishes information complex vitamin activity case vitamin E tests, correspondingly importance attaches results. drawback questionable validity species small rodents fetal resorption far observed. four experiments carried out, RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (alpha-TA) compared all-rac-alpha-TA (USP standard) mean relative activity 1.32 determined. additional measurement pyruvate kinase (PK) activity serves emphasize correlation nutrition-linked myopathy. biochemical lesion seen various animal species man. two experiments, parameters fetal resorption plasma PK activity measured together. all-rac-alpha-TA RRR-alpha-TA, following activity ratios calculated: Resorption-gestation 1:1.35; Myopathy 1:1.47. could shown two parameters measurable quantitatively single experimental set-up results good agreement. accepted activity 1 mg RRR-alpha-TA = 1.36 USP Units fully confirmed.
