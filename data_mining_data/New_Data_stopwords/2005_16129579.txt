 identified TRB3, human homologue Drosophila tribbles, novel transcriptional target phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. TRB3 expression remarkably reduced prostate cancer PC-3 cells inhibition PI 3-kinase. TRB3 expression furthermore controlled nutrient supplies: lack glucose amino acids results substantial increase TRB3 protein levels PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. increase reversed addition fresh nutrients. Stress stimuli, osmotic stress, hypoxia serum starvation affect TRB3 expression. Thus, TRB3 may function nutrient sensor. Inhibition TRB3 expression effect growth PC-3 cells regular growth conditions. However, absence glucose overexpression TRB3 PC-3 cells interfere apoptosis restore growth extracellular matrix. Taken together, data point important role TRB3 sensing reduced nutrient supplies providing survival signals periods.
