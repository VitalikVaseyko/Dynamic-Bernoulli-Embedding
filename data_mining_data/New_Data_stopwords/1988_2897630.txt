 platelets, agonists stimulate phosphoinositide turnover cause rapid phosphorylation protein apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) 40-47,000, called P47, protein kinase C (PKC). Diverse identities ascribed P47 including lipocortin, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase, pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha subunit actin regulatory protein. isolated human P47 clones immunological screening lambda gt11 complementary DNA library HL-60 cells, human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line. P47 recombinants thus identified hybridized 3.0 kilobase (kb) messenger RNA mature white blood cell lines; mRNA induced HL-60 cells differentiation. 1,050 base pair (bp) open reading frame could encode protein Mr40,087 confirmed comparison peptide sequences platelet P47, expression putative recombinant P47 E. coli vitro. P47 sequence appears conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, similar known sequence including human lipocortin alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase. P47 protein contains potential Ca2+-binding 'EF-hand' structure region strongly resembles known PKC phosphorylation sites.
