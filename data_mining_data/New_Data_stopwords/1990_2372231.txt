 Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK, EC 2.7.2.3), expressed specifically sperm spermatids, enzyme Embden-Meyerhof pathway converts glucose pyruvate. developed electrophoresis method determine relative PGK-2 quantity applied evaluate spermatogenesis activity. ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME)-induced testicular toxicity, relative PGK-2 quantity decreased 4 weeks exposure. Mean relative PGK-2 quantities, defined PGK-2 quantity PGK-1 quantity pooled spleen sample (+/- SD) were: 1.43 +/- 0.32 control animals (N = 10); 1.67 +/- 0.24 group exposed 500 mg/kg 5 days (N = 6); 1.85 +/- 0.58 group exposed 500 mg/kg 2 weeks (N = 6); 0.09 +/- 0.06 group exposed 500 mg/kg 4 weeks (N = 6); detectable animals exposed 500 mg/kg 5 weeks (N = 7); 0.208 +/- 0.103 group exposed 250 mg/kg 5 weeks (N = 6); 1.35 +/- 0.38 group exposed 125 mg/kg 5 weeks (N = 6). relative quantities showed good correlation sperm/spermatid counts (r = 0.823, p less 0.01) histological findings. findings suggest EGME toxicity primary spermatocytes spermatogonia. case sterility associated chromosomal abnormality (chromosomal translocation chromosome X 16), relative PGK-2 quantity detected seven adult (12 weeks age) mice, although many primary spermatocytes detected histological examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
