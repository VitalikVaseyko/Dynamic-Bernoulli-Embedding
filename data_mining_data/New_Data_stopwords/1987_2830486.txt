 vitro nuclear translocation system described isolated rat liver nuclei incubated defined buffered medium containing radiolabeled fluorescently labeled exogenous proteins. nuclei rapidly recovered, extracted, analyzed presence associated radiolabeled fluorescently labeled proteins. isolated nuclei exhibited specificity protein uptake seen previously vivo, accumulating simian virus 40 wild-type large-T antigen p53 excluding cytoplasmic variant large-T antigen (d10) bovine serum albumin. rapid nuclear accumulation wild-type large-T antigen shown selective dependent upon recognition wild-type nuclear location signal, ATP temperature dependent, unidirectional. Taken together, data suggest vitro system nuclear translocation wild-type large-T antigen exhibits characteristics active transport process.
