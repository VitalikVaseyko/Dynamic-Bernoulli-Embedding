 Escherichia coli NZN111, lacks activities pyruvate-formate lyase lactate dehydrogenase, AFP111, derivative contains additional mutation ptsG (a gene encoding enzyme glucose phophotransferase system), accumulate significant levels succinic acid (succinate) anaerobic conditions. Plasmid pTrc99A-pyc, expresses Rhizobium etli pyruvate carboxylase enzyme, introduced strains. compared growth, substrate consumption, product formation, activities seven key enzymes (acetate kinase, fumarate reductase, glucokinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase) glucose NZN111, NZN111/pTrc99A-pyc, AFP111, AFP111/pTrc99A-pyc exclusively anaerobic dual-phase conditions (an aerobic growth phase followed anaerobic production phase). highest succinate mass yield attained AFP111/pTrc99A-pyc dual-phase conditions low pyruvate carboxylase activity. Dual-phase conditions led significant isocitrate lyase activity NZN111 AFP111, exclusively anaerobic conditions, absence isocitrate lyase activity resulted significant pyruvate accumulation. Enzyme assays indicated dual-phase conditions, carbon flows reductive arm tricarboxylic acid cycle succinate generation also glyoxylate shunt thus provides cells metabolic flexibility formation succinate. Significant glucokinase activity AFP111 compared NZN111 similarly permits increased metabolic flexibility AFP111. differences strains benefit pyruvate carboxylase exclusively anaerobic dual-phase conditions discussed light cellular constraint redox balance.
