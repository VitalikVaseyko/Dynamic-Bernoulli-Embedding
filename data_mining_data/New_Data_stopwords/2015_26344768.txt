 Yeast cells DNA damage avoid respiration, presumably products oxidative metabolism harmful DNA. show DNA damage inhibits activity Snf1 (AMP-activated) protein kinase (AMPK), activates expression genes required respiration. Glucose DNA damage upregulate SUMOylation Snf1, catalyzed SUMO E3 ligase Mms21, inhibits SNF1 activity. DNA damage checkpoint kinases Mec1/ATR Tel1/ATM, well nutrient-sensing protein kinase (PKA), regulate Mms21 activity toward Snf1. Mec1 Tel1 required two SNF1-regulated processes-glucose sensing ADH2 gene expression-even without exogenous genotoxic stress. results imply inhibition Snf1 SUMOylation mechanism cells lower respiration response DNA damage. raises possibility activation DNA damage checkpoint mechanisms could contribute aerobic fermentation (Warburg effect), hallmark cancer cells.
