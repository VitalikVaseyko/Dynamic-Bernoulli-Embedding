 Chicken embryo cells (CECs) contain pyruvate kinase (PK) type M2 (M2-PK). Transformation CECs Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) leads reduction affinity PK substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. vitro, M2-PK phosphorylated tyrosine residues pp60v-src, transforming protein RSV. study tyrosine phosphorylation M2-PK intact RSV-transformed cells, protein immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled normal RSV-SR-A-transformed CECs. Phosphoamino acid analysis immunoprecipitated M2-PK revealed M2-PK normal transformed CECs contained phosphoserine small amounts phosphothreonine. M2-PK transformed CECs contained phosphotyrosine addition. enzyme kinetic studies M2-PK partially purified chromatography upon DEAE-Sephacel hydroxyapatite. decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate observed 3 h onset transformation using temperature-sensitive mutant RSV, ts-NY 68. kinetic changes correlated tyrosine phosphorylation M2-PK, direct evidence caused post-translational modification enzyme.
