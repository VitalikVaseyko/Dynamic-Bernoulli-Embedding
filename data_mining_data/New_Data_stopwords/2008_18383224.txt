 Nutrient enrichment nitrogen (as nitrate) carbon (as fructose) source unaerated diazo photoautorophic cultures cyanobacterium Anabaena torulosa induced early development akinetes high frequency. cultures mode nutrition aerated, akinetes differentiated. Unaerated cultures nitrate nitrogen fructose exhibited higher respiratory rates nitrogen assimilation compared aerated cultures. evidenced increased respiratory O2 uptake high activities pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase (NAD+), nitrogenase nitrate reductase signifying akinete forming unaerated cultures exhibited high carbon dissimilation nitrogen assimilation resulting high nitrogenous build cells. Aerated, non-akinete cultures, hand, associated low respiratory O2 uptake, low pyruvate kinase malate dehydrogenase (NAD+) activities, suggesting carbon dissimilation favoured either presence nitrate fructose. Moreover, higher activity NADP+ linked malate dehydrogenase lower nitrate reductase activity aerated cultures led high carbon low nitrogen content cells resulting high cellular C:N ratio. results suggest interaction carbon nitrogen metabolism regulates akinete development A. torulosa.
