 Serum pyruvate-kinase (PK) creatine-phosphokinase (CPK) determinations carried sample 30 obligate carriers DMD gene 50 normal adult control females. subjects study blood samples collected 3 times 3 independent occasions means 3 determinations considered CPK PK activities statistical analysis. Discriminant analysis shown group 30 obligate carriers estimated proportions misclassification using either serum CPK, PK enzymes fourn be: 10/30 (33.3%) CPK alone, 6/30 (20%) PK alone 5/30 (16.6%) enzymes. concluded although small proportion carriers still remain undetected concomitant use PK CPK determinations enhances capability detecting carriers Duchenne gene mainly compared CPK alone.
