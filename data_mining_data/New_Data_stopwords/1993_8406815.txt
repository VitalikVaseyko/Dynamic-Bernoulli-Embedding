 cDNA library made mRNA Candida albicans grown conditions favoring hyphal form. library screened sequences encode immunogenic proteins using pooled sera five patients oral candidiasis five uninfected patients. patients human immunodeficiency virus positive. 40,000 cDNA clones screened, 83 positive clones identified. these, 10 clones chosen random analysis. None 10 cDNAs derived multigene family. 5' 3' ends 10 clones analyzed DNA sequencing. Two cDNAs separate isolates sequence strong homology pyruvate kinase genes fungi (59 73%) humans (60%). third cDNA strong sequence homology Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kluyveromyces lactis alcohol dehydrogenase genes (68 73%). fourth cDNA homologous (81%) S. cerevisiae protein unknown function. functions remaining six C. albicans cDNAs known. detailed analysis clones encoding glycolytic enzymes revealed sera patients recognized antigens. Therefore, although glycolytic enzymes constitute group C. albicans proteins immunogenic oral esophageal infections, detection cannot exploited accurate marker infection.
