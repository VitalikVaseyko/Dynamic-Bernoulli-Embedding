 Tumor cells rely preferentially anaerobic glycolysis rather respiration ATP generation, phenomenon known Warburg effect. explored effects glucose withdrawal glioblastoma multiforme-derived cell lines nontransformed counterparts, normal human astrocytes. found glucose withdrawal induces extensive apoptosis glioblastoma multiforme cells normal astrocytes. cells examined, ATP levels sustained glucose withdrawal due elevation fatty acid oxidation ensuing respiration; however, show oxidative stress generated mitochondrial respiratory chain direct cause cell death glioblastoma multiforme cells. Oxidative stress occurs glioblastoma multiforme cells underlies selective susceptibility glucose withdrawal-induced apoptosis documented malignant cells. study implicates glycolysis potentially efficient selective target glioblastoma multiforme treatment.
