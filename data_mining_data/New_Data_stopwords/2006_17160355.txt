 Type 1 diabetes results autoimmune destruction pancreatic beta-cells, leads severe insulin deficiency. Insulin gene therapy provides attractive approach cure diabetes. critical factor insulin gene therapy surrogate cells select appropriate site insulin expression tissue-specific promoter responsive physiological glucose insulin concentrations. novel chimeric promoter, (GIRE)n-G6Pase, consisting 1.6 kb glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) promoter segment regulatory element derived L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promoter, designed provide strong tight control insulin expression liver. One three copies GIRE linked G6Pase promoter, showed stronger promoter activity G6Pase promoter alone. chimeric promoter inhibited insulin dosage-dependent manner activated glucose, two features essential glucose metabolism. promoter activity conserved species highly specific liver cells. construction chimeric promoter stronger sensitive responsive activity glucose insulin liver cells could advance studies insulin gene therapy.
