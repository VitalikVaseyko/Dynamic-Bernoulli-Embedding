 recognized rate-limiting function pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) glycolysis plays important role distributing glycolytic intermediates anabolic catabolic purposes cancer cells. However, analysis catalytic capacity PKM2 relative glycolytic enzymes, regulation range PKM2 activity, metabolic flux control, thermodynamics, suggest PKM2-catalyzed reaction rate-limiting step cancer cell glycolysis. Hexokinase phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), first third enzyme along pathway, rate-limiting enzymes limit overall glycolytic rate, whereas PKM2 lactate dehydrogenase, last two enzymes pathway, fast removal upstream intermediates prevent obstruction pathway. argument accordance catalytic capacity glycolytic enzymes, regulation range enzyme activities, metabolic flux control, thermodynamics.
