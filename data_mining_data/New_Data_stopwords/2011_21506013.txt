 causes metastasis remain unknown, however proposed nearly century metastatic cells generated fusion tumor cells tumor-associated leukocytes macrophages. Indeed, regardless cell tissue origin, cancer cells original situ tumor transform malignant, invasive cells, generally become aneuploid begin express molecules traits characteristic activated macrophages. includes two key features malignancy: chemotactic motility use aerobic glycolysis metabolic energy source (the Warburg effect). review evidence phenomena well-explained macrophage-cancer cell fusion, evidenced studies experimental macrophage-melanoma hybrids generated vitro spontaneous host-tumor hybrids animals recently humans. key finding emerge experimental spontaneous cancer cell hybrids alike displayed high degree constitutive autophagy, macrophage trait expressed hypoxia nutrient deprivation part Warburg effect. Subsequent surveys 21 different human cancers nearly 2,000 cases recently revealed vast majority (~85%) exhibited autophagy associated tumor proliferation metastasis. much work needs done, posit findings human cancers could reflection widespread leukocyte-cancer cell fusion initiator metastasis. fusions would generate hybrids express macrophage capabilities motility survival adverse conditions hypoxia nutrient deprivation, time maintaining deregulated mitotic cycle cancer cell fusion partner.
