 Hypertryptophanemia rare inherited metabolic disorder probably caused blockage conversion tryptophan kynurenine, accumulating tryptophan metabolites plasma tissues affected patients. patients present mild moderate mental retardation exaggerated affective responses, periodic mood swings, apparent hypersexual behavior. Pyruvate kinase catalyses critical step glycolysis pathway, main route provides energy brain functioning. main objective present study determine pyruvate kinase activity brain cortex rats subjected acute chemically induced hypertryptophanemia. effect alanine administration treated rats enzyme activity also investigated. also studied vitro effect two amino acids pyruvate kinase activity brain cortex nontreated rats. results indicated tryptophan inhibits pyruvate kinase vitro vivo alanine prevents inhibitory effect enzyme activity. Considering crucial role pyruvate kinase plays glucose metabolism brain, possible inhibition enzyme activity may contribute brain damage characteristic disease. studies necessary evaluate possible benefits alanine administration patients affected hypertryptophanemia.
