 Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) key enzyme trans-sulfuration pathway. CSE uses L-cysteine substrate produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S). CSE/H2S system shown play important role regulating cellular functions different systems. present study, used CSE stably overexpressed HEK-293 cells explore effect CSE/H2S system cell growth proliferation. overexpression CSE resulted increases CSE mRNA levels, CSE proteins, intracellular H2S production rates, well inhibition cell proliferation DNA synthesis. effects accompanied sustained ERK activation up-regulation cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip/WAK-1. Blocking action ERK U0126 inhibited induction p21Cip/WAK-1, suggesting ERK activation functions upstream p21Cip/WAK-1 activation initiate CSE overexpression-induced cell growth inhibition. antiproliferative effect CSE likely mediated endogenously produced H2S H2S scavenger methemoglobin (10 microm) significantly decreased H2S production rate reversed antiproliferative effect afforded CSE. Exogenous H2S (100 microm) also inhibited cell proliferation. However, CSE-catalyzed products, ammonium pyruvate, failed inhibit cell proliferation. Methemoglobin also abolished inhibitory effect exogenous H2S cell proliferation. Moreover, exogenous H2S induced sustained ERK p21Cip/WAK-1 activation. findings support hypothesis endogenously produced H2S may play fundamental role cell proliferation survival.
