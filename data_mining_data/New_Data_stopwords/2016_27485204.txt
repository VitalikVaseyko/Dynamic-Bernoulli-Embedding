 Many types human tumour cells overexpress dual-specificity phosphatase Cdc25A. Cdc25A dephosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase regulates cell cycle, substrates Cdc25A relevant cellular functions yet identified. demonstrate EGFR activation results c-Src-mediated Cdc25A phosphorylation Y59, interacts nuclear pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Cdc25A dephosphorylates PKM2 S37, promotes PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation c-Myc-upregulated expression glycolytic genes GLUT1, PKM2 LDHA, CDC25A; thus, Cdc25A upregulates positive feedback loop. Cdc25A-mediated PKM2 dephosphorylation promotes Warburg effect, cell proliferation brain tumorigenesis. addition, identify positive correlations among Cdc25A Y59 phosphorylation, Cdc25A PKM2 human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels Cdc25A Y59 phosphorylation correlate grades glioma malignancy prognosis. findings reveal instrumental function Cdc25A controlling cell metabolism, essential EGFR-promoted tumorigenesis.
