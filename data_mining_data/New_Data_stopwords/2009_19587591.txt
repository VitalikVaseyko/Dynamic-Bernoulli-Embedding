 PURPOSE REVIEW: highlight key studies providing rationale utility targeting glycolysis treatment hematological malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: Several therapeutic strategies capitalizing diagnostic utility 18fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography relies increased glycolysis glucose utilization tumor cells. Although aerobic glycolysis initially proposed Warburg due mitochondrial impairment, recent studies shown preferential switch glycolysis tumor cells functional mitochondria. Increased glucose consumption advantageous tumor cell stimulation cellular biosynthetic, energetic, pro-survival pathways. greater appreciation utilization glucose specific metabolic pathways aspects complemented nutrients glutamine. Targeting glucose consumption treatment hematological malignancies seems promising field require characterization tumor cell specific targets inhibit glucose uptake and/or glycolysis. imperative understanding tumor cell metabolome target cellular bioenergetics treatment cancer. SUMMARY: Targeting glycolytic pathway treatment hematological malignancies sufficient rationale given utility fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography diagnostic imaging. research required developing tumor cell specific therapeutics.
