 structure-function organization mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) considered. linear size complex components relation size fragments mean distances potentially active sites estimated. kinetic model complex core subunits divided conformational classes characterized different activities discussed. kinetic features model compared features model core subunits divided classes. Curves described activity PDC versus time various activities kinase phosphatase dependent binding less active core subunits. results show spatially distributed multiple active sites multi-enzyme complex drastically change full activity time without marked changes rate constants elementary reaction steps due spatially changed reaction pathways. new type regulation discussed PDC reveals unusual regulatory abilities complexes family.
