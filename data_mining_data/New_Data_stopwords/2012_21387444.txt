 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) key regulator cardiac substrate selection regulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated phosphorylation feedback inhibition. extent chronic upregulation PDK protein levels, acutely increased PDK activity acute feedback inhibition limit PDH flux remains unclear existing vitro assessment methods inherently disrupt regulation enzyme complex. demonstrated previously hyperpolarised (13)C-labelled metabolic tracers coupled MRS monitor flux PDH vivo. aim study determine relative contributions acute chronic changes PDK PDH activities vivo myocardial PDH flux. examined fed fasted rats either hyperpolarised [1-(13)C]pyruvate alone hyperpolarised [1-(13)C]pyruvate co-infused malate [to modulate mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD(+)) acetyl-coenzyme (acetyl-CoA)/CoA ratios, alter PDH activity flux]. confirm metabolic fate infused malate, performed vitro (1)H NMR spectroscopy cardiac tissue extracts. observed that, fed rats, PDH activity high, presence malate increased PDH flux 27%, whereas, fasted state, malate infusion effect PDH flux. observations suggest pyruvate oxidation limited feedback inhibition acetyl-CoA PDH activity high. Therefore, case PDH, potentially enzymes, hyperpolarised (13)C MRI used assess noninvasively enzymatic regulation.
