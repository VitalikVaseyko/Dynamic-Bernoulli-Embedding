 Excessive oxidative stress pancreatic beta cells, caused glucose fatty acids, associated pathogenesis type 2 diabetes. Mogrosides shown antioxidant antidiabetic activities animal models diabetes, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. study evaluated antioxidant effect mogrosides insulinoma cells oxidative stress caused palmitic acid, investigated underlying molecular mechanisms. Mouse insulinoma NIT-1 cells cultured medium containing 0.75 mM palmitic acid, mimicking oxidative stress. effects 1 mM mogrosides determined dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) FITC-Annexin V/PI assay cell apoptosis. Expression glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2) pyruvate kinase determined semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Palmitic acid significantly increased intracellular ROS concentration 2-fold (P<0.05), decreased expression GLUT2 (by 60%, P<0.05) pyruvate kinase (by 80%, P<0.05) mRNAs NIT-1 cells. Compared palmitic acid, co-treatment 1 mM mogrosides 48 h significantly reduced intracellular ROS concentration restored mRNA expression levels GLUT2 pyruvate kinase. However, mogrosides reverse palmitic acid-induced apoptosis NIT-1 cells. results indicate mogrosides might exert antioxidant effect reducing intracellular ROS regulating expression genes involved glucose metabolism. research needed achieve better understanding signaling pathway involved antioxidant effect mogrosides.
