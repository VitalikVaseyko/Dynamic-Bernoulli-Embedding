 Melanoma third common brain metastasis cause United States relatively high susceptibility metastasize central nervous system. Among different origins brain metastasis, originating primary gastric melanomas extremely rare. Here, compare protein profiles obtained formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tissues primary gastric melanoma meningeal metastasis. this, contents microscope slide scraped ultimately analyzed nano-chromatography coupled online tandem mass spectrometry using Orbitrap XL. results disclose 184 proteins uniquely identified primary gastric melanoma, 304 meningeal metastasis, 177 common. Notably, identified several enzymes related changes metabolism linked producing energy elevated rates glycolysis process called Warburg effect. Moreover, show FFPE proteomic approach allowed identification key biological markers S100 protein validated immunohistochemistry both, primary metastatic tumor samples. said, demonstrated powerful strategy retrospectively mine data aiding understanding metastasis, biomarker discovery, ultimately, diseases. knowledge, results disclose first time comparison proteomic profiles gastric melanoma corresponding meningeal metastasis.
