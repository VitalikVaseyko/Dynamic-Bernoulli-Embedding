 isolated hepatocyte preparation (from 24-hour fasted rats) comprised homogeneous population intact cells shown electron microscopy. Homogenates hepatocytes incubated 10 minutes ionic buffer solution containing 1.5% gelatin without hormones centrifuged 27,500 X g 30 minutes, supernatant fractions assayed enzyme activities. Hexokinase activity absent, although easily detectable fraction intact liver. activity glucokinase uninfluenced hormones. assayable activity fructose diphosphatase increased glucagon, monobutyryl cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (mb-cAMP), epinephrine, inhibited insulin. activities phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase increased insulin; however, glucagon mb-cAMP inhibited assayable activity phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase 20 25% control values. Epinephrine influence assayable activity either enzyme, although stimulated gluconeogenesis markedly glucagon mb-cAMP. liver cell homogenates subjected centrifugation higher forces (37,400 X g 60 minutes greater), assayable activity phosphofructokinase supernatant fractions began diminish. Additional loss phosphofructokinase activity observed supernates prepared cells incubated epinephrine; however, supernatant fractions, pyruvate kinase activity differ control values. results reported demonstrate (1) behavior phosphofructokinase predictable basis known solubility properties, (2) differential effects glucagon epinephrine activity phosphofructokinase suggest separate mechanisms operative stimulation glucoeogenesis glucagon epinephrine.
