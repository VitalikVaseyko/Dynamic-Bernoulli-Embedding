 Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) regulator pancreatic beta-cell gene expression important mediator glucotoxicity. Glucose increases activity nuclear localization ChREBP still ill-defined mechanisms. reveal, using MIN6 primary mouse beta-cells, unique mechanism behind ChREBP nuclear translocation. low glucose concentrations, ChREBP interacts sorcin, penta EF hand Ca(2+) binding protein, sequestered cytosol. Sorcin overexpression inhibits ChREBP nuclear accumulation high glucose reduced activity L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) TxNIP promoters, two well-characterized ChREBP target genes. Sorcin inactivation RNA interference increases ChREBP nuclear localization vivo binding L-PK promoter low glucose concentrations. Ca(2+) influx essential process since Ca(2+) chelation EGTA, pharmacological inhibition diazoxide nifedipine, blocked effects glucose. Conversely, mobilization intracellular Ca(2+) ATP caused nuclear accumulation ChREBP. Finally, sorcin silencing inhibited ATP-induced increases intracellular Ca(2+) glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. therefore conclude sorcin retains ChREBP cytosol low glucose concentrations may act Ca(2+) sensor glucose-induced nuclear translocation activation ChREBP-dependent genes.
