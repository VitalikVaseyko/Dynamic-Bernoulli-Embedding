 INTRODUCTION: Hyperactivity platelets associated thrombotic episodes molecular mechanisms yet elucidated. present work aimed identifying whether platelet protein content patients suffered arterial thrombosis episode differed platelets obtained normal healthy donors. METHODS: Differential platelet protein profiles determined 2-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis Western blot analysis total platelet lysates. Identification differentially expressed proteins carried mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). RESULTS: found decreased platelet content three protein spots patients arterial thrombosis: integrin linked kinase (ILK), fructose bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) whereas content four protein spots increased: actin binding protein, coronine like (p57), non-muscle myosin heavy chain (NMMHC-A), pyruvate kinase M2 isoenzyme (PK) phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). variations ILK, GAPDH PK validated Western blot analysis. proteins showing decreased platelet content arterial thrombosis patients associated cytoskeletal insoluble fraction detected increase proteins seems due generation peptides caused limited proteolysis. Differences protein profiles circulating platelets arterial thrombosis maintained months acute thrombotic event disappear long term. CONCLUSIONS: observed variations platelet proteins suggest existence perturbation cytoskeletal organization increased proteolysis, indicative platelet pro-active state, persistent thrombotic event.
