 Raising pO2 reduced nitrogenase activity (C2H2 reduction) Anabaena cylindrica glyoxylate-treated (5 mM) untreated cells. stimulation caused glyoxylate, however, increased increases pO2 2 99 kPa. pO2 increased net CO2 fixation lowered (Warburg effect) CO2 compensation point increased. Glyoxylate partly relieved sensitivity net photosynthesis oxygen reduced compensation point considerably. cells used preincubated dark exhaust photosynthetic pools. pronounced reduction sensitivity nitrogenase oxygen glyoxylate-treated cells evident preincubation air reduced pCO2 (13 mul l(-1)) used. was, however, evident 10-h incubation air. point 2 kPa O2 sustained highest nitrogenase activity. Addition 0.5 5 mM HCO 3 (-) Anabaena cultures preincubated low CO2 levels (29 mul l(-1)) abolished stimulatory effect glyoxylate nitrogenase. Thus, results sustain suggestion glyoxylate may act inhibitor photorespiratory activities cyanobacteria used means increasing nitrogen CO2 fixation capacities.
