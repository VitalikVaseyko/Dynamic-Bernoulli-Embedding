 application embryo-related technology dependent vitro culture systems. Unfortunately, culture media suboptimal result developmentally compromised embryos. Since embryo development partially dependent upon Warburg Effect-like metabolism, goal test response embryos treated compounds known stimulate enhance Effect. One compound 5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-3-phenyl-pent-2-enoic acid (PS48). added oocyte maturation, quality resultant embryos compromised, whereas added culture medium fertilization, PS48 improved percentage embryos reach blastocyst stage number nuclei blastocysts. Embryonic PS48 treatment resulted phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) blastocyst-stage embryos compared controls. Further, PS48 could replace bovine serum albumin embryo culture medium, demonstrated high-quality embryos developmentally competent. action PS48 appears via stimulation phosphoinositide-3 kinase phosphorylation AKT, consistent stimulation Warburg Effect.
