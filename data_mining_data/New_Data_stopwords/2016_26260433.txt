 European eel panmictic species, whose decline recorded since last 30 years. Among human-induced environmental factors decline, impact water dams species migration questioned. Indeed, water impoundments severe obstacle young eels trying reach upstream freshwater zones, even equipped fish-friendly passes. passage devices could important event shaping outcome future life life history traits eels. studied phenotypic traits associated event experience passage water obstacles. analyzed specific enzyme activities and/or gene transcription levels muscle brain test whether obstacle passage rather physical cognitive task. found long period maintenance homogenous conditions, transcription levels several genes linked synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis thyroid activity differed among field-experience groups. contrast, muscle gene transcription levels enzymatic activities show differences among fish groups. suggest cognitive processes learning memory acquisition rather swimming-related metabolic capacities involved passage water obstacles young eels.
