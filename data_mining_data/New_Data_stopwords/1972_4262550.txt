 Human platelets separated desity-centrifugation heavy light populations. Heavy platelets average volume approximately twofold greater light platelets, previously shown young platelets. 11 enzymes Embden-Meyerhof pathway plus five related enzymes: phosphoglucomutase, glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, 6-P-gluconic dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerol-P dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase (TPNH) examined cell lysates total, heavy, light platelet populations. Apparent Km individual enzymes measured total platelet population. Empirical V(max) individual enzymes measured total, heavy, light platelet populations. three apparent rate-limiting enzymes glycolysis hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase. Heavy platelets contained approximately twofold greater enzyme activity (per gram wet weight) light platelets 7 16 enzymes measured: hexokinase, phosphohexoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerokinase, lactic dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase. Heavy platelets also contained 1.9-fold greater reduced glutathione (GSH), 1.7-fold greater DPNH, 1.2-fold greater TPNH light platelets. Heavy platelets contained 1.8-fold less lipid peroxidation products (malonyl aldehyde equivalents) light platelets 2.4-fold resistant lipid peroxidation catalyzed 0.1 mM FeCl(3). Sterile incubation heavy platelets, vitro 17 hr, resulted significant loss enzyme activity "elevated" seven enzymes compared remainder. Reducing agents GSH (0.1 mM), ascorbic acid (0.1 mM), dithiothreitol (0.01 mM), added incubation mixture, significantly reduced vitro loss activity. vitro incubation also associated significant loss GSH DPNH 1.8-fold increase lipid peroxidation products.
