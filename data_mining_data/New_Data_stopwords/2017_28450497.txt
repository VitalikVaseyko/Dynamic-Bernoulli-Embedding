 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) serious health problem. However, molecular pathogenesis COPD remains unknown. Here, explored molecular effects cigarette smoke bacterial infection lung tissues COPD rats. also investigated therapeutic effects aminophylline (APL) COPD rats integrated transcriptome, proteome, metabolome data global view molecular mechanisms COPD progression. Using molecular function pathway analyses, genes proteins regulated COPD APL-treated rats mainly attributed oxidoreductase, antioxidant activity, energy fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, identified hub proteins Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), Pkm (pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2), Sod1 (superoxide dismutase 1), included energy metabolism oxidative stress. Then, identified significantly regulated metabolic pathways lung tissues COPD- APL-treated rats, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, belong lipid metabolism. particular, picked arachidonic acid metabolism detailed pathway analysis transcripts, proteins, metabolites. could observe increase metabolites genes involved arachidonic acid metabolism COPD rats decrease APL-treated rats, suggesting inflammatory responses up-regulated COPD rats down-regulated APL-treated rats. conclusion, system-wide results suggested COPD progression treatment might associated oxidative stress, lipid energy metabolism disturbance. Additionally, demonstrated power integrated omics elucidation genes, proteins, metabolites' changes disorders associated COPD.
