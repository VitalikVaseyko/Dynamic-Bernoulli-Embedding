 man, patients hereditary red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency enzyme concomitantly affected red cells liver (PK-L), red cell L' liver L PK subunits appear encoded structural gene. recently, mutant M1 PK described muscle special mouse strain M2 PK concomitantly modified. Thus, suggested M1 M2 PK subunits also encoded structural gene, gene distinct encoding L' L. paper, show synthesis four PK subunits specified different specific mRNA. Two structural genes, least four different mRNAs seem therefore control synthesis PK isozymes. Genetic epigenetic mechanisms responsible generation diversity RNA level discussed. addition mechanisms PK diversity, PK subunits modified post-translational events. red cells, instance, cell aging associated progressive, partial proteolysis C-terminal extremities L' subunits, ultimately resulting cleavage phosphorylatable site.
