 Traditional chemotherapy drugs colorectal cancer possess little specificity, leading severe intolerable side-effects. Therefore, necessary develop additional specific therapeutic strategies. suggested D-erythrose may specifically inhibit growth tumor cells. However, vivo antitumor effect D-erythrose colorectal cancer remains unknown. Thus, present study investigated antitumor effect D-erythrose abdominal metastatic model colon carcinoma. Intraperitoneal (IP) colon carcinoma-bearing BALB/c mice received IP injection D-erythrose normal saline (NS) daily 15 days. mice weighed every three days. tumor weights volume ascites evaluated following treatment. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay used assess apoptosis tumor tissues. results revealed D-erythrose significantly reduced weight intraperitoneal tumor 69.1%, markedly inhibited development ascites increased tumor cell apoptosis, without observed toxic effects. observations suggest D-erythrose possesses antitumor activity colon cancer. present study may provide potentially effective specific approach colon cancer treatment.
