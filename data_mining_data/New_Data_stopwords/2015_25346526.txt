 UNLABELLED: metabolism glutamine glucose recognized promising therapeutic target treatment cancer; however, targeted molecules mediate glutamine glucose metabolism cancer cells addressed. Here, show restricting supply glutamine hepatoma cells, including HepG2 Hep3B cells, markedly increased expression retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORalpha). Up-regulation RORalpha glutamine-deficient hepatoma cells resulted increase level cellular reactive oxygen species nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADP+ /NADPH) ratio, consistent reduction glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio. Adenovirus (Ad)-mediated overexpression RORalpha (Ad-RORalpha) treatment RORalpha activator, SR1078, reduced aerobic glycolysis down-regulated biosynthetic pathways hepatoma cells. Ad-RORalpha SR1078 reduced expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2) inhibited phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase subsequently shifted pyruvate complete oxidation. RORalpha-mediated decrease PDK2 levels caused up-regulation p21, rather p53. Furthermore, RORalpha inhibited hepatoma growth vitro xenograft model vivo. also found suppression PDK2 inhibited hepatoma growth xenograft model. findings mimic altered glucose utilization hepatoma growth caused glutamine deprivation. Finally, tumor tissue 187 hepatocellular carcinoma patients expressed lower levels RORalpha adjacent nontumor tissue, supporting potential beneficial effect RORalpha activation treatment liver cancer. CONCLUSION: RORalpha mediates reprogramming glucose metabolism hepatoma cells response glutamine deficiency. relationships established glutamine metabolism, RORalpha expression signaling, aerobic glycolysis implications therapeutic targeting liver cancer metabolism.
