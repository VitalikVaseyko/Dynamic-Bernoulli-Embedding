 Freeze-drying commonly used preserve probiotics, could cause cell damage loss viability. cryoprotectants play important role conservation viability freeze-drying. study, investigated survival rates Lactobacillus reuteri CICC6226 presence cryoprotectants sucrose, trehalose, reconstituted skim milk (RSM). addition, determined activities hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ATPases immediately following freeze-drying. results showed differences HK PK activities without cryoprotectants freeze-drying significant, cell viability activities LDH ATPase significantly different (P<0.01) prior freeze-drying. Meanwhile, results showed maintenance membrane integrity fluidity improved presence 10% trehalose 10% RSM treatments freeze-drying. results provided direct biochemical metabolic evidence injured cell freeze-drying. Freeze-drying damaged membrane structure function cell inactivated enzymes (LDH ATPases). results imply LDH ATPases key markers could used evaluate effect cryoprotectants viability metabolic activities L. reuteri CICC6226 freeze-drying.
