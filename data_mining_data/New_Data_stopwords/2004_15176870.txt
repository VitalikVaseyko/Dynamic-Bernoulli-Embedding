 Coenzyme (CoA) thioester derivative acetyl-Coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) participate 100 different reactions intermediary metabolism microorganisms. Earlier results indicated overexpression upstream rate-limiting enzyme pantothenate kinase simultaneous supplementation precursor pantothenic acid culture media increased intracellular CoA levels significantly ( approximately 10-fold). acetyl-CoA levels also increased ( approximately 5-fold) much CoA, showing carbon flux pyruvate node rate-limiting upon increase CoA levels. study, pyruvate dehydrogenase overexpressed elevated CoA levels increase carbon flux pyruvate acetyl-CoA. coexpression increase intracellular acetyl-CoA levels increased accumulation extracellular acetate. production isoamyl acetate, industrially useful compound derived acetyl-CoA, used model reporter system signify beneficial effects metabolic engineering strategy. addition, strain created acetate production pathway inactivated relieve competition acetyl-CoA node efficiently channel enhanced carbon flux ester production pathway. synergistic effect cofactor CoA manipulation pyruvate dehydrogenase overexpression acetate pathway deletion mutant led 5-fold increase isoamyl acetate production. normal growth conditions acetate pathway deletion mutant strains accumulate intracellular pyruvate, leading excretion pyruvate. However, upon enhancing carbon flux pyruvate acetyl-CoA, excretion pyruvate significantly reduced.
