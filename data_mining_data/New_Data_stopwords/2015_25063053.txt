 Critical illness, including burn injury, results elevated plasma lactate levels. Dysregulation PI3K/Akt signaling shown play predominant role inactivation skeletal muscle PDC and, hence, hyperlactacidemia rat models sepsis endotoxemia. observation, previous finding DAG reverse burn-induced skeletal muscle proteolysis activation PI3K/Akt pathway, led us hypothesize DAG may also attenuate hyperlactacidemia burn injury. investigations revealed burn injury significantly elevated skeletal muscle lactate production plasma lactate levels. Moreover, accompanied skeletal muscle 5-7 fold increase mRNA expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK) 2 4, approximately 30% reduction PDC activity. DAG treatment burn rats completely normalized mRNA expression PDKs PDC activity, also hyperlactacidemia within 24h burn injury. DAG also normalized epinephrine-induced lactate production isolated skeletal muscles normal rats. Moreover, DAG also improved survival lethal rat model burn trauma. findings DAG may clinical implications chances survival critically ill patients greatly improved plasma lactate levels normalized within 24h injury.
