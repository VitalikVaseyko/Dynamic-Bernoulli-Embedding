 Macrophages become activated initiating innate immune responses. Depending signals, macrophages obtain array activation phenotypes, described broad terms M1 M2 phenotype. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway mediates signals multiple receptors including insulin receptors, pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors, cytokine receptors, adipokine receptors, hormones. result, Akt pathway converges inflammatory metabolic signals regulate macrophage responses modulating activation phenotype. Akt family three serine-threonine kinases, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3. Generation mice lacking individual Akt, PI3K, mTOR isoforms utilization RNA interference technology revealed Akt signaling pathway components distinct isoform-specific roles macrophage biology inflammatory disease regulation, controlling inflammatory cytokines, miRNAs, functions including phagocytosis, autophagy, cell metabolism. Herein, review current knowledge role Akt signaling pathway macrophages, focusing M1/M2 polarization highlighting Akt isoform-specific functions.
