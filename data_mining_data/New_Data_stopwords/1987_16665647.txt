 activation level ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase following preincubation ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate increased ATP ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase activase absence thylakoids illumination. Maximal activation obtained 0.5 millimolar ATP presence ATP regenerating system (phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase). Without ATP regenerating system, activation lower, linearly dependent ATP concentration 1.0 millimolar, strongly inhibited ADP.
