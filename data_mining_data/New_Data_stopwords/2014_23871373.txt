 periparturient period dairy cows associated alterations insulin action peripheral tissues; however, molecular mechanism underlying process completely understood. objective examine response glucose tolerance test (GTT) analyze insulin signaling liver adipose tissues pre- postpartum dairy cows. Liver adipose tissue biopsies taken GTT, 17d prepartum 3 5d postpartum 8 high-yielding Israeli Holstein dairy cows. Glucose clearance rate GTT similar pre- postpartum. Basal insulin concentrations insulin response GTT approximately 4-fold higher prepartum postpartum. accordance, phosphorylation hepatic insulin receptor GTT higher prepartum postpartum. Across periods, positive correlation observed basal peak plasma insulin phosphorylated insulin receptor GTT liver. Hepatic phosphorylation protein kinase B GTT elevated pre- postpartum. Conversely, adipose tissue, phosphorylation protein kinase B GTT pre- postpartum increased 4 8 cows lost less body weight postpartum. results demonstrate hepatic insulin signaling regulated plasma insulin concentrations part homeorhetic adjustments toward calving, support model hepatic insulin resistance periparturient cows. Nevertheless, suggest specific insulin resistance adipose tissue occurs pre- postpartum cows prone high weight loss. different responses among cows imply genetic background may affect insulin responsiveness adipose tissue pre- postpartum.
