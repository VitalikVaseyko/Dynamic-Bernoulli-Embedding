 erythrocytes 350 pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) examined electrophoretic variation hemoglobin 26 enzymes. Seven enzymes showed variation 1% individuals: phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglucomutase-1, soluble NADP-dependent isocitric dehydrogenase, peptidase A, peptidase C, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase, acid phosphatase. Variation lesser frequency found soluble glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase, phosphoglycerate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, hemoglobin. eight samples tested esterase D, one variant phenotype. Enzymes clear variation adenylate kinase, adenosine deaminase, phosphofructokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphopyruvate hydratase (enolase), phosphoglucomutase-3, superoxide dismutase. father-to-son transmission PGI, PGM-1, peptidase C, 6PGD, 2,3-DPGAM, NADP-ICD, acid phosphatase variants, suggesting loci autosomal man.
