 Even presence oxygen cancer cells convert glucose lactate via pyruvate instead performing oxidative phosphorylation (aerobic glycolysis-Warburg effect). Thus, considered shift pyruvate - metabolite aerobic glycolysis - acetylCoA activation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). AcetylCoA metabolized oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, purpose study shift tumor cells aerobic glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation using dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor PDH-kinase. effects DCA assayed vitro Neuro-2a (murine neuroblastoma), Kelly SK-N-SH (human neuroblastoma) well SkBr3 (human breast carcinoma) cell lines. effects DCA tumor development investigated vivo using NMRI nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneous Neuro-2a xenografts. purpose animals treated continuously DCA drinking water. Tumor volumes monitored using caliper measurements via [18F]-FDG-positron emission tomography. DCA treatment increased viability/proliferation Neuro-2a SkBr3 cells, cause significant alterations PDH activity. However, significant effects DCA could observed Kelly SK-N-SH cells. Accordingly, mice bearing Neuro-2a xenografts, DCA significantly increased tumor proliferation compared mock-treated mice. Thus, could demonstrate DCA - indicated inhibitor tumor growth - efficiently promotes tumor growth Neuro-2a cells vitro vivo.
