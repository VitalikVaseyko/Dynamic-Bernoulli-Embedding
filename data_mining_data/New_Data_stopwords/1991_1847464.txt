 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latency product EBNA-1 functionally pleiotropic, required replication episomal form EBV genome role regulation latency transcription. EBNA-1 direct DNA-binding protein, replication transactivation dependent interaction EBNA-1 cognate DNA recognition sequences. better understand EBNA-1 function, characterized DNA-binding domain EBNA-1 examined contributions domains protein EBNA-1 transactivation activity. Bal31 deletional analysis carboxy-terminal region EBNA-1 identified core DNA-binding domain located amino acids 493 584. Column chromatographic, sedimentation, cross-linking studies indicated EBNA-1 exists solution dimer. Mobility retardation assays using vitro-translated variants EBNA-1 showed active DNA-binding form EBNA-1 also dimer. short-term cotransfections, pFRTK-CAT target containing EBNA-1-binding sites EBV origin plasmid replication, ori-P, transactivated carboxy-terminal EBNA-1 construction (amino acids 450 641) also carried c-myc nuclear localization signal. reconstruction experiments demonstrated transactivation domain exists within carboxy-terminal region EBNA-1, transactivation efficient nuclear localization signal present, natural karyophilic signal lies outside carboxy-terminal 191 amino acids. identify EBNA-1 nuclear localization signal, small oligonucleotides representing EBNA-1 sequences encode clusters basic peptides transferred two different vectors expressing cytoplasmic proteins (pyruvate kinase herpes simplex virus delta IE175 protein) cellular locations fusion constructions determined immunofluorescence staining transfected cells. way identified functional nuclear localization signal, Leu-Lys-Arg-Pro-Arg-Ser-Pro-Ser-Ser, encompassing amino acids 379 386 EBNA-1 protein.
