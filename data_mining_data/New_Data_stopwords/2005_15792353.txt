 parameters oxidative phosphorylation interaction creatine kinase (CK)- adenylate kinase (AK)-phosphotransfer networks situ studied skinned atrial fibers 59 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement/correction atrial septal defect correction. atria, mitochondrial CK AK effectively coupled oxidative phosphorylation, MM-CK coupled ATPases exists direct transfer adenine nucleotides mitochondria ATPases. Elimination cytoplasmic ADP exogenous pyruvate kinase associated blockade stimulatory effects creatine AMP respiration, neither could abolish coupling MM-CK ATPases direct transfer adenine nucleotides. Thus, atrial energy metabolism compartmentalized mitochondria form functional complexes adjacent ATPases. complexes isolate part cellular adenine nucleotides cytoplasmic pool participating energy transfer via CK- AK-networks, and/or direct exchange. Compared atria sinus rhythm, fibrillating atria larger exhibited increased succinate-dependent respiration relative glutamate-dependent respiration augmented proton leak. Thus, alterations mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may contribute pathogenesis atrial fibrillation.
