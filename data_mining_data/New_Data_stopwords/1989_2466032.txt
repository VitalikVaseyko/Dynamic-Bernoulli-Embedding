 human hepatoblastoma line Hep G2 modulates gene expression vitro response increasing culture density. Two stages growth defined. low density (less 200,000 cells/cm2) cultures doubling time 24 h exhibit several characteristics fetal liver cells, including increased synthesis alphafetoprotein, reduced synthesis albumin, predominance fetal isoenzymes aldolase pyruvate kinase reduced level cell surface receptor asialoglycoproteins. Confluent, high density cultures Hep G2 (greater 1 X 10(6) cells/cm2) doubling time 193 h, four fold higher level albumin production, increased levels adult isoenzymes aldolase pyruvate kinase increased asialoglycoprotein receptor. alteration albumin alphafetoprotein synthesis reflected changes messenger RNA levels relative transcription two genes. Hep G2 provides cell culture model modulation liver phenotype occurs fetal/adult development liver regeneration.
