 kinetic parameters 10 glycolytic enzymes glycolytic fluxes determined first time Ustilago maydis. Enzyme activities yeast grown minimal medium harvested stationary stage twofold higher yeast grown rich medium. contrast, yeast harvested exponential stage, enzyme activities higher cells grown rich medium. Phosphofructokinase activity lowest four culture conditions analyzed, suggesting enzyme flux-controlling step U. maydis glycolysis. V(max) K(m) values hexokinase pyruvate kinase similar conditions. results revealed U. maydis aldolase belongs class II type metalo-aldolases. 3-Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) activity 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate cofactor independent, contrasted cofactor dependency predicted amino acid sequence alignment analysis. Pyruvate secreted U. maydis yeast presence absence external glucose. glycolytic enzyme activities U. maydis mycelial form similar found yeast, except one order magnitude higher phosphofructokinase PGAM activities, thus suggesting differences glycolysis regulatory mechanisms two cellular forms.
