 1. Yeast pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) catalyzes, addition primary, physiologically important reaction, three secondary kinase reactions, ATP-dependent phosphorylations fluoride (fluorokinase), hydroxylamine (hydroxylamine kinase) glycolate (glycolate kinase). 2. reactions accelerated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, allosteric activator primary reaction. Wth Mg2+ required divalent cation, none reactions observed absence fructose-biphosphate. Mn2+, fructose-bisphosphate required glycolate kinase reaction, merely stimulates reactions. 3. effect divalent cations pH three secondary kinase reactions also examined. 4. Results compared obtained muscle pyruvate kinase implications results mechanism yeast enzyme discussed.
