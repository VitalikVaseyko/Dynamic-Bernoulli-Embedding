 Bacillus subtilis , raising amount carbon catabolite vivo would lead carbon catabolite repression (CCR) restrain absorption glucose. deleting CcpA CCR effect could relieved, absorption glucose remains restrained. phosphoenol-pyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) main glucose transportation system B. subtilis. HPr protein together HprK/P participate glucose transportation. HPr protein phosphorylated His-15 forming HPr-His-15-P transferring phosphate group HPr E II . HprK/P phosphorylate HPr Ser-46 forming HPr-Ser-46-P. HPr-Ser-46-P cannot participate transportation glucose. Knockout ccpA gene increases amount fructose 1,6-bisphosphate(FBP) vivo. FBP could activate HPr kinase. CcpA deleted, part HPr phosphorylated Ser-46. Absorpton glucose blocked. study, disruption hprk gene, obtained B. subtilisZHc/pMX45 reaches peak riboflavin production 4.374mg/mL optimum glucose concentration 10%, 19.2% higher B. subtilis24 A1/pMX45 optimum glucose concentration 8%.
