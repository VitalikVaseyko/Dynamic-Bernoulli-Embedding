 BACKGROUND: polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) found skin red grapes reported exhibit anticancer properties. antitumor effects RSV gastrointestinal tract gained considerable interest due high exposure tissue dietary compound. One hallmarks cancer cells particular metabolism mainly relying glycolysis ATP production rather mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Although RSV described act calorie-restriction mimetic, modulating energy metabolism normal tissues, little efforts done study effects polyphenol metabolism cancer cells. Taking account, aim study explore metabolic effects polyphenol colon cancer. METHODS: Oxygen consumption, ATP levels, Western blotting molecular biology techniques carried characterize metabolic signature RSV SW620 colon cancer cells. RESULTS: Paradoxically, cytotoxic effects RSV associated increase oxygen consumption supported mitochondrial biogenesis increased fatty acid oxidation. partial reversion Warburg effect followed hyperpolarization mitochondrial membrane ROS production, leading increased apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: results propose anticancer mechanisms RSV could reside targeting cancer cell metabolism, promoting mitochondrial electron transport chain overload and, ultimately, increasing ROS production. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: results shed new light anticancer mechanism RSV supporting ability compound potentiating effects chemotherapy.
