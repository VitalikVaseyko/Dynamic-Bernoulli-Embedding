 1. expression twelve liver-specific enzymes analysed twenty-one independent rat hepatoma X human somatic cell hybrids, cases forty-one subclones also tested. 2. Seventeen hybrids continued express rat liver-specific enzymes cases human isozymes glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, guanine deaminase, alcohol dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase clearly identified. 3. Analysis segregation human liver-specific enzymes hybrids led assignment human GPT chromosome 8 (previously reported, Kielty, Povey & Hopkinson, 1982) suggests assignment human GPD1 chromosome 12. 4. expression various liver-specific enzymes hybrids appeared controlled independent regulatory mechanisms. 5. Four unusual reverse segregant hybrids also analysed, liver-specific enzyme activity demonstrable.
