 characterize proteins involved melanoma dissemination, protein profiles B16F10 B16Bl6 cells compared, B16Bl6 cells give pulmonary metastases subcutaneous graft. B16F10 B16Bl6 cells invasive capacities vitro, wondered whether extracellular content could different correlate metastatic properties. shown B16F10 B16Bl6 culture cell supernatants different modulatory effects HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell invasion Matrigel-coated chambers. B16Bl6 supernatants significantly enhanced HT1080 vitro invasion compared B16F10 ones, suggesting differences protein profiles. Indeed, proteomic analysis allowed identification 18 differential proteins. Among proteins higher concentration B16Bl6 supernanants, lactate dehydrogenase B, M2 pyruvate kinase, cathepsin D, galectin 1 involved melanoma aggressiveness signature. Interestingly, several Gag retroviral proteins, well syntenin, found mainly B16F10 secretome. Although intracellular form known aggressive melanoma marker, show first time syntenin actively secreted could reduce invasion process, probably protein interactions B16 model.
