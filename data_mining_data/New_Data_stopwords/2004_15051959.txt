 Lactate dehydrogenase C4 (LDH-C4) tissue-specific enzyme mammalian testis lactate dehydrogenase isozyme sperm. Inhibitors LDH activity used determine whether enzyme plays role sperm capacitation, acrosome reaction and/or fertilization. Oxamate derivative used inhibit sperm LDH activity medium promoting capacitation. Complete inhibition LDH activity blocked capacitation. effect could reversed partially addition dbcAMP pentoxifylline culture medium. Western blotting showed oxamate N-isopropyl oxamate inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation proteins sperm capacitation process. Presumably, glycolysis primary energy pathway sperm metabolism. oxidation reduced NAD conversion pyruvate lactate LDH provides ATP necessary protein kinase (PKA) activity. data indicate LDH-C4 plays important metabolic role sperm capacitation.
