 Mathematical models key systems biology typically describe topology dynamics biological networks, listing biochemical entities relationships one another. (hyper)thermophilic Archaea contain enzyme, called non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN), catalyzes direct oxidation glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 3-phosphoglycerate omitting adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) formation substrate-level-phosphorylation via phosphoglycerate kinase. study formulate three hypotheses could explain functionally GAPN exists Archaea, construct use mathematical models test three hypotheses. used kinetic parameters enzymes Sulfolobus solfataricus (S. solfataricus) thermo-acidophilic archaeon grows optimally 60 90 degrees C pH 2 4. comparison, used model Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), organism live moderate temperatures. find first hypothesis, i.e., glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plus phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) route (the alternative GAPN) thermodynamically much uphill third hypothesis, i.e., GAPDH plus PGK required carry flux gluconeogenic direction, correct. second hypothesis, i.e., GAPDH plus PGK route delivers less 1 ATP per pyruvate delivered GAPN route, correct GAPDH reaction high rate 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate (BPG) spontaneously degrades 3PG high rate.
