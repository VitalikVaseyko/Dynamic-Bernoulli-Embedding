 Stability enzymes beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), beta-glucosidase (beta-glu), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), hexokinase (HK), ATPase microencapsulated Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 freeze-drying 10 wk storage low water activity (a(w)) room temperature studied. Bacteria microencapsulated using alginate formulation without mannitol fortification (sodium alginate mannitol [SAM] sodium alginate [SA], respectively) creating gel beads followed freeze drying. Two types dried gel beads stored low a(w), 0.07, 0.1, 0.2; storage aluminum foil used control. storage carried room temperature 25 degrees C 10 wk. Measurement beta-gal, beta-glu, LDH, PK, HK, ATPase (with without exposure pH 2.0 2 h) activities carried freeze drying, freeze drying, 10 wk storage. significant decrease almost enzyme activities, except PK. SAM SA showed different effect maintaining enzyme activities freeze drying. Storage 10 wk room temperature various low a(w) using SAM SA system significant effect retention enzymes studied, except PK LDH. Storage a(w) 0.07 0.1 effective maintaining enzyme activities storage a(w) 0.2 aluminum foil. However, mannitol fortification alginate system significantly improve retention enzymes 10 wk storage.
