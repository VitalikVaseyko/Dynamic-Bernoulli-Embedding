 Use thermotolerant strains promising way reduce cost maintaining optimum temperatures fermentation process. investigated genetically Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain showing high-temperature (41 degrees C) growth (Htg(+)) phenotype result suggested Htg(+) phenotype Htg(+) strain dominant control probably six genes, designated HTG1 HTG6. compared Htg(-) strain, Htg(+) strain showed higher survival rate exposure heat shock 48 degrees C. Moreover, Htg(+) strain exhibited significantly high content trehalose cultured high temperature stronger resistance Congo Red, agent interferes cell wall construction. results suggest strengthened cell wall combination increased trehalose accumulation support growth high temperature. gene CDC19, encoding pyruvate kinase, cloned HTG2 gene. CDC19 allele Htg(+) strain possessed five base changes upstream region, two base changes resulting silent mutations coding region. Interestingly, latter base changes probably responsible increased pyruvate kinase activity Htg(+) strain. possible mechanism leading increased activity Htg(+) phenotype, may lead activation energy metabolism maintain cellular homeostasis, discussed.
