 previously reported medium-chain TAG (MCT) could alleviate hepatic oxidative damage weanling piglets intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR). relationship oxidative status energy metabolism, process involved substrate availability glucose flux. Therefore, aim study investigate effects IUGR MCT hepatic energy metabolism mitochondrial function weanling piglets. Twenty-four IUGR piglets twenty-four normal-birth-weight (NBW) piglets fed diet either soyabean oil (SO) MCT 21 postnatal age 49 postnatal age. Then, piglets' biochemical parameters gene expressions related energy metabolism mitochondrial function determined (n 4). Compared NBW, IUGR decreased ATP contents succinate oxidation rates liver piglets, reduced hepatic mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS) activity (P<0.05). IUGR piglets exhibited reductions hepatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents gene expressions related mitochondrial biogenesis compared NBW piglets (P<0.05). MCT diet increased plasma ghrelin concentration hepatic CS succinate dehydrogenase activities, decreased hepatic pyruvate kinase activity compared diet (P<0.05). MCT-fed piglets showed improved mtDNA contents PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha expression liver (P<0.05). MCT diet alleviated decreased mRNA abundance hepatic PPARalpha induced IUGR (P<0.05). therefore postulated MCT may beneficial effects improving energy metabolism mitochondrial function weanling piglets.
