 paper describes cell-free enzymatic syntheses sucrose trehalose using partially-purified preparations sucrose trehalose synthetase. coupling regeneration uridine-5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glc) synthesis disaccharide offers practical route millimol quantities carbohydrates. syntheses used pyruvate kinase, UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, regenerated UDP-Glc cycled approximately 10 times.
