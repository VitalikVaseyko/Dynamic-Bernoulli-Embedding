 Apoptolidin first isolated secondary metabolite Nocardiopsis sp. founding member family potential selective cancer cell toxins. report isolation, production pharmacological characterization apoptolidins C alternate actinomycete producer, Amycolatopsis sp. soil samples collected Indonesia. investigated action apoptolidins C representative human glioblastoma cells, lung cancer cells mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) better understand mechanism action known apoptolidins. Shifts cellular metabolism intact cells status AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stress pathway response apoptolidin entirely consistent actions ATP synthase inhibitor. find metabolic phenotype cell critical determinant apoptolidin sensitivity likely basis cancer cell selectivity. apoptolidins induce indirect activation AMPK trigger autophagy sensitive cell types without significant inhibition mTORC1. Human U87-MG glioblastoma cells wild type MEFs showed increased phosphorylation AMPK (Thr172), ACC (Ser79) ULK1 (Ser555), whereas AMPKalpha-null MEFs glycolytic SF-295 glioblastoma cells lacked response. Although reported selective inhibitors mitochondrial ATP synthase, differences apoptolidin- oligomycin A-induced responses cells indicate action macrolides identical.
