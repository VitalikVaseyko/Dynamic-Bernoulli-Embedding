 metabolic characteristics five muscle groups spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii examined order compare anaerobic oxidative capacities. Enzyme activities phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase highest abdominal muscles supporting anaerobic burst activity. Hexokinase, citrate synthase, HOAD activities leg antennal muscles indicated higher aerobic potential. Arginine kinase activities high muscle groups indicating muscle phosphagens important energy reserve. Arginine phosphate concentrations 4th periopod abdominal flexor muscle lobsters sampled field higher values captive animals, approximately five times ATP. Muscle lactates high captive animals. Responses emersion simulated live transport appear exploit capacity functional anaerobiosis differentiated muscle groups. Abdominal muscles especially sensitive 24 h showed significant increases lactate, glucose, ADP, AMP. ATP levels appeared maintained muscle phosphagens raised doubts efficacy adenylate energy charge evaluating emersion response. Haemolymph glucose, lactic acid, ammonia peaked 24 h emersion largely restored following re-immersion. propose arginine phosphate concentrations 4th periopod appropriate index metabolic stress, could lead improved commercial handling protocols.
