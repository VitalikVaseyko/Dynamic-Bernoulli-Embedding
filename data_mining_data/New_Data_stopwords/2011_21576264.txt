 Tumor cells gain survival/growth advantage adapting metabolism respond environmental stress, process known metabolic transformation. best-known aspect metabolic transformation Warburg effect, whereby cancer cells up-regulate glycolysis aerobic conditions. However, mechanisms mediating metabolic transformation remain undefined. report carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C), brain-specific metabolic enzyme, may participate metabolic transformation. CPT1C expression correlates inversely mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation, contributes rapamycin resistance murine primary tumors, frequently up-regulated human lung tumors. Tumor cells constitutively expressing CPT1C show increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation, ATP production, resistance glucose deprivation hypoxia. Conversely, cancer cells lacking CPT1C produce less ATP sensitive metabolic stress. CPT1C depletion via siRNA suppresses xenograft tumor growth metformin responsiveness vivo. CPT1C induced hypoxia glucose deprivation regulated AMPKalpha. Cpt1c-deficient murine embryonic stem (ES) cells show sensitivity hypoxia glucose deprivation altered FA homeostasis. results indicate cells use novel mechanism involving CPT1C FA metabolism protect metabolic stress. CPT1C may thus new therapeutic target treatment hypoxic tumors.
