 method studying platelet:collagen interaction described permits simultaneous measurement platelet adhesion collagen collagen-initiated release reaction. Plasma-free platelets passed short columns composed polymeric collagen covalently linked agarose (Sepharose 2B). EDTA (0.3 mM) used prevent platelet aggregation. 14C-Serotonin used measure extent release reaction. Measurement adhesion based upon 51Cr. experiments described, extents adhesion serotonin release function total collagen content column number platelets applied. 100 per cent applied platelets adhered columns. much 70 per cent platelet serotonin released. Intracellular 51Cr, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, hand, lost platelets. Plasma-free platelets prepared two different techniques: gel filtration differential centrifugation. preparations gave results. influence column temperature also examined. temperatures 37 degrees C., sharp drop serotonin release, slight decline platelet adhesion collagen. results suggest collagen/Sepharose assay system provide usable greatly needed technique studying molecular basis platelet:collagen interaction assessing platelet function abnormal states investigating mechanism action potential inhibitors.
