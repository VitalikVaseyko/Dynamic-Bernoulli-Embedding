 energy metabolism evaluated gastrocnemius muscle 3-month-old rats subjected either mild severe 4-week intermittent normobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, 4-week treatment CNS-acting drugs, namely, alpha-adrenergic (delta-yohimbine), vasodilator (papaverine, pinacidil), oxygen-increasing (almitrine) agents performed. muscular concentration following metabolites evaluated: glycogen, glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio; citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate; aspartate, glutamate, alanine; ammonia; ATP, ADP, AMP, creatine phosphate. Furthermore Vmax following muscular enzymes evaluated: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase; total NADH cytochrome c reductase; cytochrome oxidase. adaptation chronic intermittent normobaric mild severe hypoxia induced alterations components anaerobic glycolytic pathway [as supported increased activity lactate dehydrogenase and/or hexokinase, resulting decreased glycolytic substrate concentration consistent increased lactate production lactate-to-pyruvate ratio] mitochondrial mechanism [as supported decreased activity malate dehydrogenase and/or citrate synthase resulting decreased concentration key components tricarboxylic acid cycle]. effect concomitant pharmacological treatment suggests action CNS-acting drugs could also related direct influence muscular biochemical mechanisms linked energy transduction.
