 liver, reaction catalysed alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alanine becomes effective precursor gluconeogenesis. present study amino-oxyacetate (AOA) used evaluate effect liver ALT activity carnivorous fish Sparus aurata. Moreover, derived metabolic effects metabolites key enzymes glycolysis, gluconeogenesis pentose phosphate pathway also studied. dose-effect-dependent inhibition AOA hepatic cytosolic mitochondrial ALT activity observed vitro. vivo, AOA behaved inhibitor hepatic cytosolic ALT activity. long-term exposure AOA increased pyruvate kinase activity liver irrespective composition diet supplied fish. 1H NMR studies showed inclusion AOA diet decreased hepatic levels alanine, glutamate glycogen. Moreover, 2H NMR analysis indicated higher renewal rate alanine liver fish fed high-carbohydrate/low-protein diet, AOA decreased alanine 2H-enrichment irrespective diet. present study indicates AOA-dependent inhibition cytosolic ALT activity could help increase use dietary carbohydrate nutrients.
