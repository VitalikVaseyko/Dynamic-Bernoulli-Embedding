 High-grade gliomas aggressive intensely glycolytic tumors. present study, evaluated mitochondrial respiratory function glioma cells (T98G U-87MG) fresh human glioblastoma (GBM) tissue. end, measurements oxygen consumption rate (OCR) performed various experimental conditions. OCR T98G U-87MG cells well coupled ADP phosphorylation based ratio ATP produced per oxygen consumed ~2.5. agreement, basal OCR GBM tissue also partially associated ADP phosphorylation. basal respiration intact T98G U-87MG cells limited supply endogenous substrates, indicated increased OCR response protonophore. cells also displayed high affinity oxygen, evidenced values partial pressure oxygen respiration half maximal (p 50). permeabilized glioma cells, ADP-stimulated OCR approximately 50% obtained presence protonophore, revealing significant limitation oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) relative activity electron transport system (ETS). characteristic maintained cells grown low glucose conditions. Flux control coefficient analyses demonstrated impaired OXPHOS associated function mitochondrial ATP synthase adenine nucleotide translocator, phosphate carrier. Altogether, data indicate availability metabolism respiratory substrates mitochondrial ETS preserved T98G U-87MG glioma cells even though cells possess relatively restrained OXPHOS capability.
