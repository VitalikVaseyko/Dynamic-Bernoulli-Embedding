 Dual specificity protein kinases (DSPKs) unique enzymes execute multiple functions cell, otherwise performed exclusively serine/threonine tyrosine protein kinases. study, characterized protein kinases Bas2152 (PrkD) Bas2037 (PrkG) Bacillus anthracis. Transcriptional analyses kinases showed expressed phases growth. serendipitous discovery, kinases found DSPKs. PrkD found similar eukaryotic dual specificity Tyr phosphorylation-regulated kinase class dual specificity kinases, autophosphorylates Ser, Thr, Tyr residues phosphorylates Ser Thr residues substrates. PrkG found bona fide dual specificity protein kinase mediates autophosphorylation substrate phosphorylation Ser, Thr, Tyr residues. sites phosphorylation kinases identified mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation Tyr residues regulates kinase activity PrkD PrkG. PrpC, known Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, also found possess dual specificity. Genistein, known Tyr kinase inhibitor, found inhibit activities PrkD PrkG affect growth B. anthracis cells, indicating possible role kinases cell growth development. addition, glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase found phosphorylated PrkD Ser Thr residues PrkG. Thus, study provides first evidence DSPKs B. anthracis belong different classes different modes regulation.
