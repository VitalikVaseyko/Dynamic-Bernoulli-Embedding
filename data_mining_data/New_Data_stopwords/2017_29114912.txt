 Pyruvate kinase (PYK) operates glycolytic pathway, responsible regulating balance glycolysis gluconeogenesis. previous work indicates PYK acts development Drosophila embryos embryonic muscle growth, may inferred PYK acts insect fecundity. point, central enzyme glycolytic pathway, PYK acts many energy-spending functions organisms. background findings triazophos (TZP) stimulates fecundity via increase activities several genes brown planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens, investigated combined influence TZP silencing N. lugens PYK (NlPYK) reproduction-linked biological performance parameters. Here, report TZP+dsNlPYK treatments led reduced (by 26%) ovarian, fat body, protein content relative controls. Ovarian (35%) fat body (54%) soluble sugar contents reduced. TZP+dsNlPYK treatments also led reduced (by 24%) fecundity, expressed numbers eggs laid. data show directly NlPYK acts insect fecundity, probably via increases glucose metabolism.
