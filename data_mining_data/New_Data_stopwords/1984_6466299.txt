 technique rapid sampling, cooling homogenization rat liver described. effectiveness preserving activity status pyruvate kinase (soluble) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) (microsomal) sampling assessed comparison freeze-clamping technique simple excision mincing liver tissue homogenization. results suggest cold-clamping equally effective freeze-clamping preserving activity status pyruvate kinase liver samples obtained situ, addition allows subsequent separation subcellular fractions, notably microsomes (microsomal fractions) mitochondria. suggested property makes technique useful studying activity status enzymes (e.g. HMG-CoA reductase) assay subject interference activity enzymes released damaged organelles crude homogenates freeze-clamped liver samples. suggestion tested directly; cold-clamping technique found preserve substantially higher initial/total HMG-CoA reductase activity ratio [Easom & Zammit (1984) Biochem. J. 220, 739-745] subsequently isolated microsomes compared obtained microsomes prepared liver samples processed conventional manner. integrity mitochondria isolated homogenates cold-clamped liver samples preserved, judged latency intramitochondrial enzymes good respiratory control mitochondria. Possible areas metabolic studies cold-clamping technique could applied suggested.
