 Dysfunction Neurospora crassa nuclear Dbf2-related kinase COT1 leads cessation tip extension massive induction new sites growth. determine role phosphorylation plays COT1 function, mutated COT1 residues corresponding positions highly conserved nuclear Dbf2-related phosphorylation sites. Analyses point-mutation cot-1 strains (mimicking non- constitutively phosphorylated states) indicate involvement COT1 phosphorylation regulation hyphal elongation branching well asexual development altering cell wall integrity actin organization. Phosphorylation COT1's activation segment (at Ser417) required proper vitro kinase activity, limited effect hyphal growth. marked contrast, even though phosphorylation C-terminal hydrophobic motif (at Thr589) crucial COT1 functions vivo, lack Thr589 phosphorylation significantly affect vitro COT1 kinase activity. Nevertheless, regulatory role made evident significant increase observed COT1 kinase activity residue substituted manner mimicking constitutive phosphorylation. conclude COT1 regulates elongation branching independent manner, determined phosphorylation state.
