 OBJECTIVE: study energy metabolite pattern term pregnant myometrium compare striated skeletal muscle. STUDY DESIGN: Metabolites carbohydrates, triglycerides nucleotides determined biopsies myometrium rectus abdominis muscle ten healthy term pregnant women onset labour. metabolite concentrations two types muscle compared two tailed Student's t-test paired values correlations calculated Pearsson's correlation test. RESULTS: Comparison two muscle types revealed higher concentration glucose higher lactate/pyruvate ratio myometrium lower concentration triglyceride metabolites. Adenosine found 36-fold higher concentration uterine compared rectus muscle inverse relationship adenosine glucose concentrations observed myometrium. CONCLUSION: results indicated pregnant uterine smooth muscle utilized glucose principal nutritive metabolite rather lipids anaerobic pathway glucose metabolism active myometrium compared striated rectus muscle. Also, suggested glucose critical role principal fuel ATP formation involvement adenylate kinase 5'-nucleotidase reactions event glucose shortage.
