However, lymphocyte preparations, free white cells, still contaminated non-negligible amount thrombocytes. could shown biochemical system studied, functional behavior morphological state cells similar white cells purified procedures previously used. Further, numeration technique, based DNA estimation, presented used cell count becomes inaccurate cell agglutination.
