 present study, observed rapid robust activation ribosomal protein S6K (S6 kinase) provoked MI (myocardial infarction) mice. activation S6K promotes cell growth, hypothesized increased S6K activity contributes pathological cardiac remodelling MI suppression S6K activation may prevent aberrant cardiac remodelling improve cardiac function. mice, administration rapamycin effectively suppressed S6K activation heart significantly improved cardiac function MI. heart weight/body weight ratio fibrotic area substantially reduced rapamycin-treated mice. rapamycin-treated mice, decreased cardiomyocyte remodelling cell apoptosis observed compared vehicle-treated controls. Consistently, inhibition S6K PF-4708671 displayed similar protection MI rapamycin. Mechanistically, observed significantly enhanced Thr308 phosphorylation activation Akt rapamycin- PF-4708671-treated hearts. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) Akt1/3 abolished cardioprotection MI presence rapamycin administration. results demonstrate S6K inhibition rendered beneficial effects left ventricular function alleviated adverse remodelling following MI mice enhancing Akt signalling, suggesting therapeutic value rapamycin PF-4708671 treating patients following MI.
