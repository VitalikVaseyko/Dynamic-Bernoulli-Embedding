 relationship enhanced responses gluconeogenesis norepinephrine (NE) glucagon zonal distribution studied liver lobules cold-exposed rats examination preparations enriched periportal hepatocytes (PP-H) perivenous hepatocytes (PV-H) digitonin-collagenase perfusion technique. control group, gluconeogenesis lactate (10 mM) plus pyruvate (1 mM) higher PP-H PV-H. NE (100 nM) glucagon (100 nM) increased rate gluconeogenesis 80 70%, respectively, PP-H PV-H. Gluconeogenesis PP-H unchanged cold exposure. rate PV-H increased rate PP-H 5 days cold exposure, rate returned control value 20 days. gluconeogenic response alpha-adrenergic action NE PP-H PV-H doubled 5 days. response glucagon tripled PP-H cut half PV-H 20 days. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 1 microM), A-23187 (100 nM), dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP; 1 mM) increased rate gluconeogenesis 200, 100, 80%, respectively, PP-H PV-H control group. responses PMA A-23187 unchanged exposure cold. response DBcAMP doubled PP-H cut half PV-H 20 days cold exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
