 osmotolerant Zymomonas mobilis strain suc40, (containing plasmid pDS3154-inaZ), capable producing simultaneously ethanol ice nuclei protein, cultivated chemically defined complete sucrose medium, well sugar beet molasses medium continuous culture. strain exhibited normal Monod's relationship biomass dilution rate, growth substrate concentration dilution rate. Specific activities number enzymes appear control important steps metabolic flux Entner-Doudoroff pyruvate decarboxylation pathways investigated range growth rates steady state cultures. exception glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gluconate kinase, enzymes exhibited similar pattern wild type Z. mobilis CP4 osmotolerant mutants, independent media used; enzyme patterns remained relatively constant studied growth range. specific activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase increased 2-fold decreasing dilution rate sugar beet molasses. specific activity gluconate kinase 2-fold lower medium growth rates compared either low high growth rates. Pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase alcohol dehydrogenase activities significantly higher compared enzymes governing early steps Entner-Doudoroff pathway. present study, designed determine behaviour important enzymes sucrose metabolism Z. mobilis suc40/pDS3154-inaZ grown continuous culture showed microorganism required regulation specific enzyme activities transcriptional level sugar beet molasses used growth medium.
