 High serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activity normoalbuminuric patients type 1 diabetes (T1D) predicts progression diabetic nephropathy (DN), mechanisms behind remain unclear. observed treatment cultured human podocytes sera normoalbuminuric T1D patients high LPS activity downregulated 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), activator Akt cell survival pathway, induced apoptosis. Knockdown PDK1 cultured human podocytes inhibited antiapoptotic Akt pathway, stimulated proapoptotic p38 MAPK pathway, increased apoptosis demonstrating antiapoptotic role PDK1 podocytes. Interestingly, PDK1 downregulated glomeruli diabetic rats patients type 2 diabetes onset proteinuria, suggesting reduced expression PDK1 associates podocyte injury development DN. Treatment podocytes vitro mice vivo LPS reduced PDK1 expression induced apoptosis, prevented inhibiting Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway immunomodulatory agent GIT27. data show LPS downregulates cell survival factor PDK1 induces podocyte apoptosis, blocking TLR pathway GIT27 may provide non-nephrotoxic means prevent progression DN.
