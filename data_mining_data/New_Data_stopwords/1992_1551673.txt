 new large Danish family X-linked retinitis pigmentosa studied linkage analysis. Carrier diagnosis performed using full-field electro-retinogram combined careful fundus examination. Multipoint linkage analysis, employing DNA markers proximal short arm X chromosome cytogenetic centromere marker, revealed highest location score distally DXS255 proximal ornithine carbamoyl transferase locus. comparison first Danish family studied, pericentromeric recombination fraction increased; speculated observed difference genetic distances centromere 2 Danish families correlated difference size location centromeric heterochromatin.
