 effects carbohydrate sources/complexity rearing temperature hepatic glucokinase (GK) glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activities gene expression studied gilthead sea bream juveniles. Two isonitrogenous (50% crude protein) isolipidic (19% crude lipids) diets formulated contain 20% waxy maize starch 20% glucose. Triplicate groups fish (63.5 g initial body weight) fed diet near satiation four weeks 18 degrees C 25 degrees C. Growth, feed intake, feed efficiency protein efficiency ratio, higher higher water temperature. water temperatures fish growth feed efficiency higher glucose diet. Plasma glucose levels influenced water temperature higher fish fed glucose diet. Hepatosomatic index liver glycogen higher lower water temperature within water temperature fish fed glucose diet. effect water temperature enzymes activities observed, except hexokinase GK higher 25 degrees C. Hepatic hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities influenced diet composition, whereas glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity higher fish fed glucose diet. Higher GK activity observed fish fed glucose diet. GK gene expression higher 25 degrees C fish fed waxy maize starch diet fish fed glucose diet, temperature effect GK gene expression observed. Hepatic G6Pase activities gene expression neither influenced dietary carbohydrates water temperature. Overall, data suggest gilthead sea bream juveniles hepatocytes dietary carbohydrate source temperature affect intensively GK, enzyme responsible first step glucose uptake, G6Pase enzyme involved last step glucose hepatic release.
