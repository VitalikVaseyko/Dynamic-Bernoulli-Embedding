 Isolated vegetative tumour cells mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma showed low rates basal respiration low oxygen uptake rates cytochrome-c oxidase activity. cells affected marked Crabtree effect high rate lactate production presence 10 mM glucose. glycolytic capacity tumour also assessed measurement maximum activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. activities similar ones found fast-growing, undifferentiated tumours. concentration fructose-2,6-bisphosphate tumour 2,3 nmoles/g fresh tissue wt., value order magnitude found types highly glycolytic cells. concluded Lewis lung carcinoma follows pattern undifferentiated tumours high capacity glucose amino acid utilization.
