 Oxidative stress known contribute insulin resistance diabetes, however mechanism clear. show reactive oxygen species (ROS) could reprogram glucose metabolism upregulating pentose pathway induce insulin resistance type 2 diabetes (T2DM). using streptozotocin-high fat diet (STZ-HFD) induced T2DM rats, show diabetic rats exhibited high level oxidative stress accompanied insulin resistance. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) protein expression well downstream target glucokinase (GK), upregulated; glycogen synthesis increased accordingly; However glycolysis inhibited indicated decreased phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), pyruvate kinase (PK), phospho-PFK-2/PFK-2 (p-PFK-2/PFK-2) ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK); Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) promotes pyruvate generate acetyl-CoA declined well. phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-ACC/ACC) ratio increased, meaning lipid beta-oxidation increased. pentose pathway activated indicated increased G6PD activity NADPH level. results suggest diabetic rats countervail ROS stress increasing pentose pathway, reprogram energy metabolic pathway glycolysis lipid oxidation order compensate ATP requirement body, causes insulin resistance.
