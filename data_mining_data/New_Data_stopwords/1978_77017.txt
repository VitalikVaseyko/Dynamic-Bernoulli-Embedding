 proliferation-competent adult rat liver cell monolayer system analyzed tissue-specific functions growth cycle. High levels adult (L type) form pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) glutathione S-transferase B ("ligand," EC 2.5.1.18) observed early lag phase; decline markedly logarithmic phase reappear stationary phase. contrast, elevated levels fetal (K type) form pyruvate kinase alpha1-fetoprotein production appear proliferation begins; pattern diminishes slightly stationary phase adult phenotype restored. Albumin production continues throughout entire growth cycle. vitro findings simulate observed hepatoproliferative transitions intact animal and, such, constitute developmental program normal epithelial cells primary culture.
