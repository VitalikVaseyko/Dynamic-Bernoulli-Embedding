 Five amphibian species studied effect hypophysial hormones water balance. species three anurans, Rana ridibunda, Bufo viridis Pelobates syriacus, two urodeles Salamandra salamandra Triturus vittatus. first four species different stages development studied, newt terrestrial aquatic phases adult examined. hormones used oxytocin (OXY), arginine vasotocin (AVT) prolactin (PL). Oxytocin caused water retention compared hormones, especially responding juveniles Rana Bufo, also terrestrial phase adult newt Triturus. Arginine vasotocin affected mostly juvenile Pelobates. Prolactin caused water retention juvenile Rana terrestrial phase Triturus. general hormones affected juvenile stages either larvae adults.
