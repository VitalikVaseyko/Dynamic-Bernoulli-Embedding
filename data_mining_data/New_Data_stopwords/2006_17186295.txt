 Endurance exercise transiently increases mRNA key regulatory proteins involved skeletal muscle metabolism. prolonged exercise subsequent recovery, circulating plasma fatty acid (FA) concentrations elevated. present study therefore aimed determine sensitivity key metabolic genes FA exposure, assessed vitro using L6 myocytes secondly, measure expression set genes vivo, following single exercise bout post-exercise rise plasma FA abolished acipimox. Initial studies using L6 myotubes demonstrated dose responsive sensitivity PDK4 PGC-1alpha mRNA acute FA exposure vitro. Nine active males performed two trials consisting 2 h exercise, followed 2 h recovery. one trial, plasma FA availability reduced administration acipimox (LFA), pharmacological inhibitor adipose tissue lipolysis, second trial placebo provided (CON). exercise bout recovery, rise plasma FA glycerol abolished acipimox treatment. Following exercise mRNA abundance PDK4 PGC-1alpha elevated unaffected either acipimox placebo. analysis skeletal muscle gene expression demonstrated CPT gene suppressed trials, whilst UCP-3 gene modestly regulated exercise alone. Acipimox ingestion alter response CPT UCP-3. Thus, study demonstrates normal increase circulating concentrations FA later stages exercise subsequent recovery required induce skeletal muscle mRNA expression several proteins involved regulating substrate metabolism.
