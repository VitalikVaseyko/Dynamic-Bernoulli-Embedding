 human erythrocyte generates high-energy adenosine triphosphate anaerobic glycolysis cycles oxidized reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate aerobic pentose phosphate shunt pathway. Certain enzymopathies pentose phosphate shunt associated hemolysis resulting oxidative denaturation hemoglobin. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, X-chromosome-linked disorder, prototype diseases genetically clinically polymorphic. Six enzymopathies anaerobic glycolysis cause hemolytic anemia; lactate dehydrogenase deficiency not. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate greatly reduced asymptomatic polycythemia noted. Pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase deficiency, enzymopathy nucleotide metabolism, characterized intracellular accumulations pyrimidine-containing nucleotides, marked basophilic stippling stained blood film, splenomegaly, hemolysis. Lead inhibits nucleotidase identical syndrome occurs severe lead poisoning. Hemolysis also accompanies unusual enzymopathy characterized 40- 70-fold increase (not decrease) adenosine deaminase activity.
