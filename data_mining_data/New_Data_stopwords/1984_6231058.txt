 Damage plasma membrane rabbit epididymal spermatozoa spontaneous lipid peroxidation examined means trypan blue uptake expression activity intracellular enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. dye uptake expression enzyme activity probe cell damage lipid peroxidation loss integrity plasma membrane. linear correlation obtained trypan blue staining cells malondialdehyde production, quantifiable measure extent lipid peroxidation. point trypan blue staining cells, 0.5 nmol malondialdehyde/10(8) cells produced. amount produced point complete loss motility superoxide dismutase activity. defined "lipoperoxidative lethal end point." Expression lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities increased time aerobic incubation. high Na+ medium, NTP, lipid peroxidation slow, linear correlation increase expressed enzyme activities malondialdehyde production. high K+ medium, KTP, lipid peroxidation rapid, initial rapid rise expressed enzyme activity 3 h, followed slower increase. Activities rabbit sperm lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, flagellar ATPase unaffected aerobic incubations 48 h, double incubation period used assay enzymatic activities first two. activity glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase decreased aerobic incubation, time course matching loss motility. subcellular distribution lactate dehydrogenase rabbit spermatozoa determined: 4% mitochondrial matrix, 10% plasma membrane 85% cytosolic compartment.
