 AIMS: Diet-induced obesity associated increased myocardial fatty acid (FA) utilization, insulin resistance, cardiac dysfunction. study designed test hypothesis impaired glucose utilization accounts initial changes FA metabolism. METHODS RESULTS: Ten-week-old C57BL6J mice fed high-fat diet (HFD, 45% calories fat) normal chow (4% calories fat). Cardiac function substrate metabolism isolated working hearts, glucose uptake isolated cardiomyocytes, mitochondrial function, insulin-stimulated protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) Akt substrate (AS-160) phosphorylation, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, mRNA levels metabolic genes determined 2 5 weeks HFD. Two weeks HFD reduced basal rates glycolysis glucose oxidation prevented insulin stimulation glycolysis hearts reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake cardiomyocytes. Insulin-stimulated Akt/PKB AS-160 phosphorylation preserved, PDH activity unchanged. GLUT4 content reduced 55% GLUT4 translocation significantly attenuated. HFD increased FA oxidation rates myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), could accounted mitochondrial uncoupling increased expression peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) target genes, increased 5 weeks HFD. CONCLUSION: Rates myocardial glucose utilization altered early course HFD reduced GLUT4 content GLUT4 translocation despite normal insulin signalling Akt/PKB AS-160. reciprocal increase FA utilization due PPAR-alpha-mediated signalling mitochondrial uncoupling. Thus, initial increase myocardial FA utilization response HFD likely results impaired glucose transport precedes impaired insulin signalling.
