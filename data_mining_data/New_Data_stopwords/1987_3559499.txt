 Activities eight enzymes measured sonic muscle gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta, determine metabolic poise unique tissue evaluate potential sex related differences metabolism. contrast prior study (Pennypacker et al., '85, J. Exp. Zool., 239: 259-264), observed substantial activities M4-lactate dehydrogenase, 333 482 units/g wet sonic muscle weight. observation presence high activities enzymes glycolytic anaerobic metabolism (pyruvate kinase creatine phosphokinase) lead us conclude tissue high anaerobic capacity. Also contrast observations Pennypacker et al. ('85), found activities enzymes indicative aerobic metabolism relatively low. example, activities citrate synthase found sonic muscle (1.5 2.7 units/g) slightly higher values obtained toadfish white skeletal muscle (1.2 units/g). discrepancies results obtained two studies appear methodological ones. Lastly, significant differences enzyme activities males females observed lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, possible explanations differences discussed.
