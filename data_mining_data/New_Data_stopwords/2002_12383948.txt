 Available information fate insulinotropic action L-alanine isolated pancreatic islets restricted data collected obese hyperglycemic mice. Recent data, however, collected mostly tumoral islet cells either RINm5F line BRIN-BD11 line, drawn attention possible role Na(+) co-transport insulinotropic action L-alanine. present study conducted islets prepared normal adult rats, L-alanine found (i) inhibit pyruvate kinase islet homogenates, (ii) affect oxidation endogenous fatty acids islets prelabelled [U-14C]palmitate, (iii) stimulate 45Ca uptake islets deprived exogenous nutrient, (iv) augment insulin release evoked either 2-ketoisocaproate L-leucine, whilst failing significantly affect glucose-induced insulin secretion. oxidation L-[U-14C]alanine unaffected D-glucose, inhibited L-leucine. Inversely, L-alanine decreased oxidation D-[U-14C]glucose, failed affect L-[U-14C]leucine oxidation. concluded occurrence positive insulinotropic action L-alanine restricted selected experimental conditions, secretory data compatible view stimulation insulin secretion tested nutrient(s) reflects, rule, capacity augment ATP generation islet B cells. However, possible role Na(+) co-transport secretory response L-alanine cannot ignored.
