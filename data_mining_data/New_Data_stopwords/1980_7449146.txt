 family complete deficiency lactate dehydrogenase M-subunit investigated. propositus 18-year-old male complained exertional pigmenturia easy fatigue. Marked discrepancy observed ratio creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase (CK/LDH). Electrophoretic analysis serum LDH isoenzymes propositus demonstrated one activity band LDH H4. complete lack LDH M-subunit similarly demonstrated erythrocytes, leukocytes intermediate vastus muscle. LDH levels muscle specimen markedly decreased patient, whereas CK aspartate aminotransferase almost control subject. LDH isoenzymes erythrocytes analyzed 5 siblings parents. demonstrated complete lack LDH M-subunit 3 siblings. ratio H-subunit M-subunit (H/M) erythrocyte LDH suggested partial absence M-subunit two siblings parents. abortive increase blood lactate marked increase blood pyruvate observed immediately ischemic work forearm, accompanied increase serum creatine kinase myoglobinuria. present case represents newly described form genetically determined myopathy.
