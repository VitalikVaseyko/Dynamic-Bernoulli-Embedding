 levels activity enzymes involved oxidative metabolism determined left ventricular tissue spontaneously hypertensive rats compared normotensive controls. Levels pyruvate kinase increased 1.3 fold indicative elevated glycolytic activity. Similarly, enhanced levels lactate dehydrogenase found, consistent requirement increased oxidation cytosolically-generated NADH. addition active malate-aspartate shuttle, heart provides major route transfer reducing equivalents mitochondria, suggested elevated levels cytosolic isoenzyme aspartate aminotransferase; malate dehydrogenase increase activity enzyme high unlikely rate-limiting shuttle. levels expression mRNAs three enzymes (pyruvate kinase, aspartate aminotransferase malate dehydrogenase) also determined correlated well extent change, any, changes enzymatic activity. Thus seems one response development hypertension rats increase expression genes certain key enzymes involved oxidative metabolism.
