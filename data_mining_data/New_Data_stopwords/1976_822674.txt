 Haemoglobin fractions 16 enzymatic activities red cells patient juvenile chronic myeloid leukaemia compared normal, comparably reticulocyte-rich, non-neonatal fetal red cells. activities hexokinase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, monophosphoglyceromutase, enolase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase significantly increased fetal red cells beyond activities cell populations comparable reticulocytosis. activities enzymes also increased patient's erythrocytes. Together haemoglobin F concentration 54% concentration haemoglobin Bart's 1% variations reflect fetal nature red cells. Simultaneously, signs dyserythropoiesis found red cells patient: high activity hexokinase low pyruvate kinase activity.
