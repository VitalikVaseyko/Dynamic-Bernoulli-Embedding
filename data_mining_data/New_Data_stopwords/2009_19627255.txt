 hypothesis PDHK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4) potential target treatment type 2 diabetes tested feeding wild-type PDHK4 knockout mice high saturated fat diet induces hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinaemia, glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis obesity. Previous studies shown PDHK4 deficiency lowers blood glucose limiting supply three carbon gluconeogenic substrates liver. concern, however, increase glucose oxidation caused less inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphorylation inhibit fatty acid oxidation, promote ectopic fat accumulation worsen insulin sensitivity. examined feeding wild-type PDHK4 knockout mice high saturated fat diet 8 months. Fasting blood glucose levels increased gradually groups remained significantly lower PDHK4 knockout mice. Hyperinsulinaemia developed groups, glucose tolerance better body weight lower PDHK4 knockout mice. termination, less fat present liver skeletal muscle PDHK4 knockout mice. Higher amounts PGC-1alpha [PPARgamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) coactivator 1alpha] PPARalpha lower amounts fatty acid synthase acetyl-CoA carboxylase isoenzyme 1 present liver PDHK4 knockout mice. findings suggest PDHK4 deficiency creates conditions alter upstream signalling components involved regulation lipid metabolism. findings support hypothesis PDHK4 viable target treatment type 2 diabetes.
