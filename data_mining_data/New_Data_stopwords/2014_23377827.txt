 Pancreatic cancer patients frequently show hyperglycemia, uncertain whether hyperglycemia stimulates pancreatic cancer cells. investigated whether excess glucose induces hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) stimulates glucose metabolism cell migration pancreatic cancer cells. studied wild-type (wt) MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa2 subline (namely si-MiaPaCa2) HIF-1alpha-specific small interfering RNA. Wt-MiaPaCa2 cells known HIF-1alpha-positive hypoxia HIF-1alpha-negative normoxia, whereas si-MiaPaCa2 cells devoid HIF-1alpha normoxia hypoxia. incubated cells different amounts glucose determined HIF-1alpha mRNA protein real-time polymerase chain reaction western blotting. determined glucose consumption, lactate production intracellular hexokinase-II ATP assess glucose metabolisms determined pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, reactive oxygen species fumarate assess mitochondrial activities. Further, studied cell migration using Boyden chamber. Excess glucose (16.7-22.2mM) increased HIF-1alpha hypoxic wt-MiaPaCa2 cells. HIF-1alpha expression increased ATP contents inhibited mitochondrial activities. Extracellular glucose hypoxia stimulated glucose metabolisms independent HIF-1alpha. Excess glucose stimulated migration wt- si-MiaPaCa2 cells normoxia hypoxia. Thus, glucose stimulated cell migration independent HIF-1alpha. Nevertheless, hypoxic wt-MiaPaCa2 cells showed greater migrating ability si-MiaPaCa2 counterparts. conclude (1) excess glucose increases HIF-1alpha ATP hypoxic wt-MiaPaCa2 cells, (2) extracellular glucose hypoxia regulate glucose metabolisms independent HIF-1alpha (3) glucose stimulates cell migration mechanisms dependent HIF-1alpha independent it.
