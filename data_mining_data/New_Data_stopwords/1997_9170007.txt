 BACKGROUND: Hypertension coronary heart disease programmed maternal undernutrition utero. feeding low-protein diets rats pregnancy results higher blood pressure offspring age weaning. OBJECTIVE: determine whether low-protein diet increases foetal exposure glucocorticoids maternal origin, resulting altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function hypertension. DESIGN: Rats fed 18% casein diet (control) 9% casein diet (low protein) pregnancy. Low-protein-fed dams injected metyrapone inhibit corticosterone synthesis metyrapone plus replacement dose corticosterone. offspring pregnancies blood pressure determined aged 7 weeks. METHODS: systolic blood pressure determined using indirect tail-cuff method. Glucocorticoid action hypothalamus measured using glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase reference enzyme. RESULTS: Blood pressures rats exposed maternal low-protein diets utero elevated significantly relative control rats. animals exposed maternal low-protein diet also exhibited increased glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity hypothalamus, whereas pyruvate kinase activity changed. offspring rats injected metyrapone raised blood pressure GPDH activities. Replacement corticosterone pregnancy effect upon blood pressures GPDH activities male offspring, reversed effects metyrapone female offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure maternal low-protein diet utero programmes hypertension rat. data consistent hypothesis corticosteroids maternal origin play role programming effect.
