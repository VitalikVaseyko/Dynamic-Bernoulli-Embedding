 Adaptation cancer cells hypoxic microenvironment important facilitated malignant growth advanced development. One major mechanism mediating hypoxic response involves up-regulation hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) expression, controls reprogramming energy metabolism angiogenesis. Oestrogen-related receptor-alpha (ERRalpha) pivotal regulator cellular energy metabolism many biosynthetic pathways, also proposed important factor promoting Warburg effect advanced cancer. others previously shown ERRalpha expression increased prostate cancer also prognostic marker. show ERRalpha oncogenic prostate cancer also key hypoxic growth regulator. ERRalpha-over-expressing prostate cancer cells resistant hypoxia showed enhanced HIF-1alpha protein expression HIF-1 signalling. effects could also observed ERRalpha-over-expressing cells grown normoxia, suggesting ERRalpha could function pre-adapt cancer cells meet hypoxia stress. Immunoprecipitation FRET assays indicated ERRalpha could physically interact HIF-1alpha via AF-2 domain. ubiquitination assay showed ERRalpha-HIF-1alpha interaction could inhibit ubiquitination HIF-1alpha thus reduce degradation. ERRalpha-HIF-1alpha interaction could attenuated XCT790, ERRalpha-specific inverse agonist, resulting reduced HIF-1alpha levels. summary, show ERRalpha promote hypoxic growth adaptation prostate cancer cells via protective interaction HIF-1alpha, suggesting ERRalpha potential therapeutic target cancer treatment.
