 Extensive use fossil fuels leading increasing CO(2) concentrations atmosphere causes changes carbonate chemistry oceans represents major sink anthropogenic CO(2). result, oceans' surface pH expected decrease ca. 0.4 units year 2100, major change potentially negative consequences marine species. carbonate skeleton, sea urchins larval stages regarded likely one sensitive taxa. order investigate sensitivity pre-feeding (2 days post-fertilization) feeding (4 7 days post-fertilization) pluteus larvae, raised Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos control (pH 8.1 pCO(2) 41 Pa e.g. 399 muatm) CO(2) acidified seawater pH 7.7 (pCO(2) 134 Pa e.g. 1318 muatm) investigated growth, calcification survival. three time points (day 2, day 4 day 7 post-fertilization), measured expression 26 representative genes important metabolism, calcification ion regulation using RT-qPCR. one week development, observed significant difference growth. Maximum differences size detected day 4 (ca. 10% reduction body length). comparison gene expression patterns using PCA ANOSIM clearly distinguished different age groups (two-way ANOSIM: Global R=1) acidification effects less pronounced (Global R=0.518). Significant differences gene expression patterns (ANOSIM R=0.938, SIMPER: 4.3% difference) also detected day 4 leading hypothesis differences CO(2) treatments could reflect patterns expression seen control experiments younger larva thus developmental artifact rather direct CO(2) effect. found regulation metabolic genes (between 10%and 20% ATP-synthase, citrate synthase, pyruvate kinase thiolase day 4) regulation calcification related genes (between 23% 36% msp130, SM30B, SM50 day 4). Ion regulation mainly impacted regulation Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase day 4 (15%) regulation NHE3 day 4 (45%). conclude studies stressor induces alteration speed development, crucial employ experimental designs high time resolution order correct developmental artifacts. helps prevent misinterpretation stressor effects organism physiology.
