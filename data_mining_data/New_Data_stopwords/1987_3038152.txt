 Calcium-activated neutral protease (milli-CANP) endogenous inhibitor elevated muscle tissues, primarily skeletal muscle heart, dystrophic mice (C57BL/6J dy/dy) compared control strain (C57BL/10J). Tissues showing relative increase CANP also show significant loss enzymes CK, LDH comparison plasma, enzymes register significant increase. PK lost minimally tissues, probably showing "sparing effect." Absence significant change CANP activity liver points specific role CANP dystrophic process. skeletal muscle endogenous CANP inhibitor registers concomitant increase CANP without altering enzyme/inhibitor ratio.
