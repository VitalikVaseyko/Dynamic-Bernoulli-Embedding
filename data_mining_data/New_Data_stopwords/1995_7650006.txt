 regulation contractile activity mice bearing null mutation M-isoform creatine kinase gene, investigated tissue extracts Triton X-100-treated preparations ventricular, soleus, gastrocnemius muscles control transgenic mice. Skinned fiber experiments evidence statistical difference maximal force calcium sensitivity either muscle type. Rigor tension development low MgATP concentration greatly influenced phosphocreatine control transgenic mice expected. calcium-activated ventricular preparations, although force developed cross-bridge control transgenic animals, rate constant tension changes appeared markedly slowed transgenic animals. ventricular isomyosin pattern altered, suggested that, transgenic animals, cross-bridge cycling hindered local decrease MgATP MgADP ratio, due lack local MgATP regenerating system. Myokinase activity significantly changed activities pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase found increased transgenic animals. results show fundamental remodelling occurs myofibrils transgenic animals important adaptations modify bioenergetic pathways including glycolytic metabolism.
