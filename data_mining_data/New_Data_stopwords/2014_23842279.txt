 HIV infection therapy associated disorders lipid metabolism bioenergetics. Previous work suggested viral protein R (Vpr) may contribute development lipodystrophy insulin resistance observed HIV-1-infected patients. adipocytes, Vpr suppresses mRNA expression peroxisomal proliferator-activating receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)-responsive genes inhibits differentiation. investigated whether Vpr might interact PPARbeta/delta influence transcriptional activity. presence PPARbeta/delta, Vpr induced 3.3-fold increase PPAR response element-driven transcriptional activity, 1.9-fold increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) protein expression, 1.6-fold increase phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit E1alpha leading 47% decrease activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex HepG2 cells. PPARbeta/delta knockdown attenuated Vpr-induced enhancement endogenous PPARbeta/delta-responsive PDK4 mRNA expression. Vpr induced 1.3-fold increase mRNA expression carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) acetyl-coenzyme acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2) doubled activity beta-hydroxylacyl coenzyme dehydrogenase (HADH). Vpr physically interacted ligand-binding domain PPARbeta/delta vitro vivo. Consistent role energy expenditure, Vpr increased state-3 respiration isolated mitochondria (1.16-fold) basal oxygen consumption rate intact HepG2 cells (1.2-fold) etomoxir-sensitive manner, indicating oxygen consumption rate increase beta-oxidation-dependent. effects Vpr PPAR response element activation, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity, beta-oxidation reversed specific PPARbeta/delta antagonists. results support hypothesis Vpr contributes impaired energy metabolism increased energy expenditure HIV patients.
