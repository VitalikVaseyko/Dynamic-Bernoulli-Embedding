 1. effects protein concentration ionic strength adsorption individual glycolytic enzymes F-actin F-actin--trypomyosin--troponin studied. 2. Appreciable association demonstrated conditions physiological ionic strength high protein concentration, tropomyosin--troponin established important generalized component interactions. 3. Phosphofructokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate isomerase strongly bound conditions, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase hexokinase displayed less adsorption structural proteins. 4. influence number parameters adsorption phenomena examined. Ca2+ fructose 1,6-diphosphate increased adsorption aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, decreasing adsorption enzymes constant-proportion group. 5. major enzymic components skeletal muscle, creatine kinase, adenylate kinase malate dehydrogenase showed adsorption F-actin--tropomyosin--troponin experimental conditions. adsorption evident, however, case aspartate aminotransferase, (NADP) isocitrate dehydrogenase alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase. 6. results discussed relation functional significance roles enzyme compartmentation cell.
