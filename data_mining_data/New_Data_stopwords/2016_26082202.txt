 M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), identified predominant cause Warburg effect cancer cells, essential tumor metabolism growth. However, role PKM2 autophagy remains elucidated. present study investigated effect PKM2 knockdown autophagy apoptotic cell death human A549 alveolar adenocarcinoma cells. Two short hairpin (sh)RNAs targeting human PKM2 mRNA designed lentiviral vectors constructed. A549 cells infected lentiviruses, containing shRNAs PKM2, expression PKM2 examined reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) immonoblotting analysis. lactose dehydrogenase (LDH)coupled enzyme assay used detect pyruvate kinase activity. RTqPCR used detect mRNA expression level glycolysisassociated enzymes. quantification cells punctate LC3 expression LC3II examined demonstrate autophagy. MTT assay used detect cell viability flow cytometry used determine cell apoptosis. activity caspase 3/7 expression Bcl2 also detected A549 cells PKM2 knockdown. present study demonstrated two shRNAs efficiently downregulated mRNA protein expression levels PKM2 A549 cells. knockdown PKM2 decreased pyruvate kinase activity glycolysis. Autophagy induced A549 cells PKM2 knockdown. Inhibition autophagy accelerated apoptotic death PKM2knockdown cells dependent increased caspase 3/7 activity decreased expression Bcl2. conclusion, downregulation PKM2 induced apoptosis autophagy A549 cells autophagy protected cells apoptotic cell death.
