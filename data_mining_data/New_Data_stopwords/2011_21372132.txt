 Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) key transcription factor required cellular adaptation hypoxia, although physiological roles activation mechanisms normoxia studied sufficiently. Warburg effect, hallmark malignant tumors characterized increased activity aerobic glycolysis, accompanies activation HIF-1 normoxia. Besides tumor cells multiple genetic epigenetic alterations, normal macrophages also use glycolysis ATP production depending upon elevated HIF-1 activity even normoxia. recently found activity factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) specifically suppressed macrophages nonproteolytic activity membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP/MMP-14). Thus, MT1-MMP expressed macrophages plays significant role regulating HIF-1 activity normoxia. light finding, examined whether MT1-MMP contributes Warburg effect tumor cells. tumor cell lines express MT1-MMP exhibit increased glycolytic activity, forced expression MT1-MMP MT1-MMP-negative tumor cells sufficient induce Warburg effect. cytoplasmic tail MT1-MMP mediates stimulation aerobic glycolysis increasing expression HIF-1 target genes. Specific intervention MT1-MMP-mediated activation HIF-1 tumor cells retarded tumor growth mice. Systemic administration membrane-penetrating form cytoplasmic tail peptide mice inhibit HIF-1 activation competitively also exhibited therapeutic effect tumors.
