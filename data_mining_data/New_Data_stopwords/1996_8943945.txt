 Phospholamban ablation associated significant increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity basal cardiac contractile parameters. determine whether observed phenotype due loss phospholamban alone accompanying compensatory mechanisms, hearts phospholamban-deficient age-matched wild-type mice characterized parallel. morphological alterations detected light microscope level. Assessment protein levels cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, calsequestrin, myosin, actin, troponin I, troponin revealed significant differences phospholamban-deficient wild-type hearts. However, ryanodine receptor protein levels significantly decreased (25%) upon ablation phospholamban, probably attempt regulate release Ca2+ sarcoplasmic reticulum, significantly higher diastolic Ca2+ content phospholamban-deficient compared wild-type hearts (16.0 +/- 2.2 versus 8.6 +/- 1.0 mmol Ca2+/kg dry wt, respectively). increases Ca2+ content specific junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum stores, alterations Ca2+ content mitochondria band. Assessment ATP levels revealed alterations, although oxygen consumption increased (1.6-fold) meet increased ATP utilization hyperdynamic phospholamban-deficient hearts. increases oxygen consumption associated increases (2.2-fold) active fraction mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, suggesting increased tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover ATP synthesis. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrated decreases phosphocreatine levels increases ADP AMP levels phospholamban-deficient compared wild-type hearts. However, creatine kinase activity creatine kinase reaction velocity different phospholamban-deficient wild-type hearts. findings indicate ablation phospholamban associated downregulation ryanodine receptor compensate increased Ca2+ content sarcoplasmic reticulum store metabolic adaptations establish new energetic steady state meet increased ATP demand hyperdynamic phospholamban-deficient hearts.
