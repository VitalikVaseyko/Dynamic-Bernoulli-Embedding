 Dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, anti-tumor properties various carcinoma models. Diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA), over-the-counter drug chronic liver disease, derivative DCA. date, studies evaluated anticancer potential DADA breast cancer. study, MDA-MB-231 cells, breast adenocarcinoma cell line, used vitro vivo experiments evaluate anti-tumor efficacy DADA DCA. half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) DADA (7.1 +/- 1.1 mmol/L) MDA-MB-231 cells significantly lower DCA (15.6 +/- 2.0 mmol/L); 100 mg/kg (0.0004 mol/kg) DADA better 100 mg/kg (0.0008 mol/kg) DCA suppressing growth subcutaneous transplantation breast tumor dose 24 days intervention. Histological examination showed DCA DADA interventions led necrosis, inflammation, fibrosis tumor tissue mouse subcutaneous transplantation breast tumor model. DADA treatment inhibited Ki67 expression tumor tissue. vitro experiments showed DADA could inhibit lactic acid production glucose uptake MDA-MB-231 cells 10 mmol/L effects stronger DCA. DADA administration also induced complete autophagy early treatment stages incomplete autophagy cell death later treatment stages. conclusion, DADA showed better anti-tumor efficacy DCA breast cancer model.
