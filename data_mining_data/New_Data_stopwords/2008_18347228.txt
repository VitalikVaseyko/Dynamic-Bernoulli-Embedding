 sought define contribution 2 kinin receptors (bradykinin 1 receptor [B(1)R] bradykinin 2 receptor [B(2)R]) cardioprotection angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition acute myocardial infarct. Wild-type mice gene knockout mice missing either B(1)R B(2)R submitted coronary ligation without concurrent ACE inhibition evaluation left ventricular systolic capacity assessment fractional shortening (FS). Baseline FS similar animals remained unchanged sham-operated ones. 3 weeks myocardial infarct, wild-type group 27% reduction FS (P<0.5) without ACE inhibition 8% ACE inhibition; B(1)R(-/-) groups FS reduced 24% different (at 28%) ACE inhibition; B(2)R(-/-) groups, however, FS decreased 39% ACE inhibition decreased 52%. Analysis bradykinin receptor gene expression hearts showed one receptor missing, became significantly upregulated; B(1)R remained highly overexpressed B(2)R(-/-) mice throughout, whereas overexpressed B(2)R became significantly suppressed B(1)R(-/-) mice manner quantitatively directionally similar wild-type mice. conclude bradykinin receptors contribute cardioprotective bradykinin-mediated effect ACE inhibition, B(2)R believed previously; but, whereas potentiated bradykinin absence B(1)R, upregulation B(2)R simply insufficient provide full cardioprotection, absence B(2)R, upregulated B(1)R actually seems inflict tissue damage.
