 Thrombotic events known increased patients sickle cell syndromes variety abnormalities coagulation endothelial function described, although relevance findings either pathogenesis vaso-occlusive phenomena risk thrombosis unclear. Heparin cofactor II (HCII) antithrombin III circulating inhibitors thrombin low plasma levels associated increased risk thrombosis otherwise healthy individuals. describe first time abnormally low plasma levels HCII patients sickle cell syndromes. 45 adult patients sickle cell syndromes (31 SS, 10 SC, 4 beta Thal) compared 61 age matched control patients HCII plasma. highly significant reduction HCII SS patients irrespective crisis transfusion state 0.68 +/- 0.15 U/ml (mean +/- SD) compared controls 1.00 +/- 0.19 U/ml (P < 0.001). HCII antigen also significantly reduced (0.53 +/- 0.19 U/ml) compared controls (1.02 +/- 0.23 U/ml, P < 0.0001). contrast reduction antithrombin III group. HCII (0.63 +/- 0.13 U/ml, P < 0.001) HCII antigen (0.54 +/- 0.08 U/ml, P < 0.001) also significantly reduced SC patients HCII levels increased towards control values sickle cell crises, patients taking contraceptive pill, regular blood transfusion; however, plasma HCII concentrations increased acutely exchange transfusion. HCII also decreased thalassaemia intermedia pyruvate kinase deficiency, suggesting intravascular haemolysis may cause reduced HCII levels.
