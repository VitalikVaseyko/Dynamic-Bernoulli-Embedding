 One classical feature cancer cells metabolic acquisition highly glycolytic phenotype. Carbon monoxide (CO), one products cytoprotective molecule heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) cancer cells, implicated carcinogenesis therapeutic resistance. However, functional contributions CO HO-1 processes poorly defined. human prostate cancers, found HO-1 nuclear localized malignant cells, low enzymatic activity moderately differentiated tumors correlating relatively worse clinical outcomes. Exposure CO sensitized prostate cancer cells normal cells chemotherapy, growth arrest apoptosis induced vivo part mitotic catastrophe. CO targeted mitochondria activity cancer cells evidenced higher oxygen consumption, free radical generation, mitochondrial collapse. Collectively, findings indicated CO transiently induces anti-Warburg effect rapidly fueling cancer cell bioenergetics, ultimately resulting metabolic exhaustion.
