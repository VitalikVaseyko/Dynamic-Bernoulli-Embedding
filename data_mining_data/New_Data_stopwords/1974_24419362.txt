 Heritability estimates determined random-bred Q population mice seven enzymes, liver weight body weight. estimates calculated son-on-father regression 10 weeks age mating Q strain males inbred CBA females. Instead using fathers sons calculate heritability, families highest lowest fathers chosen suggested Hill (1970). heritability body weight general agreement previous published data (0.40). estimate liver weight higher (0.71(*)) liver alkaline phosphatase significant (0.52(*)). estimates enzymes significantly different zero (plasma alkaline phosphatase, -0.12; lactate dehydrogenase, -0.34; pyruvate kinase, 0.29; alcohol dehydrogenase, -0.10; hexokinase, -0.10; malate dehydrogenase, -0.20).
