 Marine organism derived extracts, previously identified containing compounds inhibited C4 acid cycle enzyme pyruvate P(i) dikinase (PPDK), assessed ability exhibit effect C4 plants Digitaria ciliaris Echinochloa crus-galli. Oxygen electrode studies revealed half extracts inhibited C4 acid driven photosynthesis leaf slices. Seventeen extracts deleterious effect C4 plants vivo within 24 h, whereas 36 caused observable phytotoxic response one C4 plants used vivo testing. None extracts inhibited PPDK metabolism pyruvate via directly competitive mechanism, instead hindering enzyme either mixed uncompetitive means. screening strategy, using suite assays, led isolation identification herbicidal marine natural product ilimaquinone.
