 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, causing hemolytic anemia, associated malaria protection prevalence sub-Saharan Africa known far. work shows results study undertaken determine PK deficiency occurrence sub-Saharan African countries, well finding prevalent PK variant underlying deficiency. MATERIALS METHODS: Blood samples individuals four malaria endemic countries (Mozambique, Angola, Equatorial Guinea Sao Tome Principe) analyzed order determine PK deficiency occurrence detect possible high frequent PK variant mutation. association mutation malaria ascertained association studies involving sample groups individuals showing different malaria infection outcome status. RESULTS: percentage individuals showing reduced PK activity Maputo 4.1% missense mutation G829A (Glu277Lys) PKLR gene (only identified three individuals worldwide date) identified high frequency. Heterozygous carrier frequency 6.7% 2.6%. significant association detected either PK reduced activity allele 829A frequency malaria infection outcome, although variant frequent among individuals uncomplicated malaria. CONCLUSIONS: first study occurrence PK deficiency several areas Africa. common PKLR mutation G829A (Glu277Lys) identified. global geographical co-distribution malaria high frequency PK deficiency seems occur suggesting malaria may selective force raising frequency 277Lys variant.
