 AMP-activated protein kinase reported phosphorylate rodent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme reductase [HMG-CoA reductase; (S)-mevalonate:-NAD+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.88] Ser-871, thereby lowering catalytic activity [Clarke, P. R. & Hardie, D. G. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 2439-2446]. explore physiologic role reaction, prepared cDNA encoding mutant form hamster HMG-CoA reductase alanine substituted serine residue 871. overexpressed transfected cells, wild-type enzyme, Ser-871 Ala mutant, labeled [32P]phosphate, confirming Ser-871 site phosphorylation. wild-type enzyme, mutant enzyme, showed reduced activity cells harvested phosphatase inhibitor KF, confirming phosphorylation mechanism inactivation within cell. Despite lack phosphorylation, posttranscriptional feedback regulation mutant enzyme normal, indicated reduced activity cells incubated mevalonate, 25-hydroxycholesterol, low density lipoprotein. Moreover, mutant enzyme showed normal acceleration degradation transfected cells incubated sterols. Cells expressing wild-type enzyme showed decreased incorporation [14C]pyruvate sterols ATP depleted incubation 2-deoxy-D-glucose. reduction seen cells expressing Ser-871 Ala mutant enzyme. conclude AMP-activated protein kinase play role end-product feedback regulation HMG-CoA reductase, rather comes play cellular ATP levels depleted, thereby lowering rate cholesterol synthesis preserving energy stores cell.
