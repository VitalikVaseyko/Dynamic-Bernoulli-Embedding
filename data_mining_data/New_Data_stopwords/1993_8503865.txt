 adenosine kinase inhibitor 5-iodotubercidin (Itu) found following effects glycogen metabolism hepatocytes fasted rats. (1) Itu strongly stimulated glycogen synthesis different substrates (glucose, lactate plus pyruvate, dihydroxyacetone, glycerol fructose). cells incubated substrates, well-known stimulating effect amino acids Itu additive. (2) parallel increase glycogen deposition, increase synthase decrease phosphorylase concentrations administration Itu. Synthase increased Itu amino acids additive manner, whereas observed activation phosphorylase addition amino acids antagonized Itu. (3) contrast amino acids, Itu increased neither cell volume aspartate glutamate concentrations. (4) Itu enhanced levels cyclic AMP. stimulation glycogen deposition presence Itu persisted cyclic AMP concentration increased adenosine 2-chloroadenosine. (5) Itu decreased concentration ATP, effects glycogen synthesis, synthase phosphorylase concentrations persisted ATP catabolism prevented adenosine. (6) effect Itu glycogen synthesis result inhibition adenosine kinase, since 5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine, another inhibitor enzyme, effect glycogen deposition.
