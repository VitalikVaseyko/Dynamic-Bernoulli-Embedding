 Sporozoites unsporulated oocysts Eimeria tenella shown contain pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) apparently lack ATP-specific activity. PPi-PFK resembles occur number protists reversible subject metabolic control. contrast, ADP-utilising pyruvate kinase, present two developmental stages parasite, exhibited strong positive cooperativity respect substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, shown allosterically activated glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate AMP. suggested PPi-PFK represents adaptation parasite towards life environment containing low concentrations oxygen unusual allosteric regulation pyruvate kinase evolved compensate glycolysis controlled PPi-PFK step.
