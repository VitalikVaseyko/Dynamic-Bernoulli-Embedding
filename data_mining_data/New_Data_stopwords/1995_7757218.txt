 bifunctional imidoester dimethyl suberimidate hydrochloride stabilize rat red blood cells (RBCs) membrane protein crosslinking, way used carrier systems exogenous substances. Counter-current distribution fractionation charge-sensitive dextran-polyethyleneglycol two-phase systems used detect slight changes surface charge stabilized cells. decrease surface charge crosslinked RBCs apparent masking age-related cell surface properties found result protein crosslinking. Digitonin treatment used permeabilize crosslinked RBCs produces significant decrease cell surface charge age-related surface properties seem modified treatment.
