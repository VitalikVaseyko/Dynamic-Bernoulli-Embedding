 BACKGROUND: Malignant transformation cells often accompanied up-regulation glycolysis-related enzymes transporters, well distortion mitochondrial respiration. consequence, malignant tumors utilize high amounts glucose produce accumulate high concentrations lactate, even presence oxygen. phenomenon termed 'Warburg Effect'. Here, aimed resolving interrelation tumor metabolism, reactive oxygen species, double strand DNA breaks radio-resistance ovarian cancer-derived cells. METHODS: model system two ovarian cancer-derived cell lines, OC316 IGROV-1, corresponding xenografts used. First, metabolic properties xenografts tested ensure initial vitro data might later transferred vivo data. parallel, three inhibitors tumor cell metabolism, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, inhibitor glycolysis, oxamate, pyruvate analogue inhibitor lactate dehydrogenase, rotenone, specific inhibitor mitochondrial electron complex I, tested effect metabolism radio-sensitivity respective ovarian cancer-derived cell lines. RESULTS: found three inhibitors tested led significant changes tumor cell energy metabolism non-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, found inhibition tumor glycolysis 2-deoxy-D-glucose combination rotenone decreased radio-resistance clinically relevant radiation dose. apparent radio-sensitizing effect appears based increased level double strand DNA breaks 1 h 24 h gamma irradiation. cancer-derived cell lines maintained metabolic properties, well protein expression profiles levels reactive oxygen species xenografts, thus providing suitable model system vivo investigations. CONCLUSION: combination metabolic inhibitors reactive oxygen species-generating therapies, irradiation, may effectively enhance therapeutic response particularly metabolically highly active (ovarian) tumors.
