 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA mitochondria key regulatory enzyme oxidation glucose acetyl-CoA. Phosphorylation PDC pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK) inhibits activity. expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene increased fasting conditions associated switch utilization glucose fatty acids energy source. Transcription PDK4 gene elevated glucocorticoids inhibited insulin. study, investigated factors involved regulation PDK4 gene hormones. Glucocorticoids stimulate PDK4 two glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites located 6000 base pairs upstream transcriptional start site. Insulin inhibits glucocorticoid induction part causing dissociation GR promoter. Previously, found estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) stimulates expression PDK4. Here, determined one ERRalpha binding sites contributes insulin inhibition PDK4. binding site forkhead transcription factor (FoxO1) adjacent ERRalpha binding sites. FoxO1 participates glucocorticoid induction PDK4 regulation gene insulin. data demonstrate glucocorticoids insulin modulate PDK4 gene expression complex hormone response units contain multiple factors.
