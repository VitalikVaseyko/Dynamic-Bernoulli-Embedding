 Nitrogen permease regulator like-2(NPRL2) candidate tumor suppressor gene(TSG) located chromosome 3p21.3 deletions frequently occur region, leading canceration. Recently, molecular pathologic researches provided valuable insights downregulation NPRL2 carcinogenesis types cancers. However, little known genetic changes NPRL2 involved glioma. Here, first time, aimed understand expression levels, functions mechanisms NPRL2 progression glioma. clearly demonstrated NPRL2 expression decreased glioma negatively correlated histologic grade. upregulation NPRL2 expression glioma cells inhibited proliferation inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest vitro suppressed growth xenotransplanted tumors. contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown NPRL2 promoted glioma growth. anti-cancer effects NPRL2 involved dephosphorylation PDK1(Tyr9) downstream AKT1(Thr308) resulting inactivation PDK1-AKT1 signaling pathway, ultimately increased expression p21 p27, inactivated CDK2 CDK4. data confirmed NPRL2 downregulated gliomas. importantly, NPRL2 able inhibit cell proliferation vitro repress tumorigenicity vivo, suggesting role tumor suppressor. data provide basis development promising therapeutic target glioma.
