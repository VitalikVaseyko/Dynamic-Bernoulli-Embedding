 HepG2 cells induced high concentration insulin establish insulin-resistant cell model (HepG2/IR). effect 12b-hydroxy-des-D-garcigerin (DGA) glucose consumption (GC) HepG2/IR cells analyzed glucose oxidase/peroxidase assay. results showed DGA significantly stimulated GC enhancing activity hexokinase (HK) pyruvate kinase (PK) HepG2/IR cells. cell signaling pathway DGA enhances GC HepG2/IR cells explored. results showed DGA promoted expression insulin receptor (InsR) protein, stimulated expression insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (p-PI3-K), phospho-protein kinase B Serine(473) (p-AKT ser(473)). Therefore, concluded DGA improved insulin-resistance HepG2/IR cells inducing IRS-1/PI3-K/Akt cell signaling pathway. Interestingly, DGA effect phosphorylation threonine(172) (Thr(172)) AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
