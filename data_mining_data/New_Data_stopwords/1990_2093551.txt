 explore early diagnostic effects serum pyruvate kinase (PK) myocardial infarct extension (MIE), activity serum PK, glutamate oxalacetate transaminase (GOT), creatine kinase (CK) isoenzyme (CK-MB) measured 102 cases acute myocardial infarction (AMI). results showed dynamic changes PK similar CK-MB, serum PK 9.2 hours earlier CK-MB determination onset MIE. Furthermore introduced MIE AMI model ligating branch coronary arteries conscious dogs. Compare pathologic findings PK dynamic changes showed double peak plateau types brought MIE. believe serial measuring serum PK helpful early diagnosis MIE.
