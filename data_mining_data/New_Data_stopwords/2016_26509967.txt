 Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) useful preoperative diagnosis gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs); however, molecular characteristics glucose metabolism GIST unknown. evaluated 18F-FDG uptake preoperative PET/CT 40 patients analyzed expression glycolytic enzymes resected GIST tissues qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry. Results receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) cut-off value 4.99 sensitivity 89.5%, specificity 76.2%, accuracy 82.5% identifying tumors high risk malignancy. found 18F-FDG uptake correlated positively tumor size, risk grade, expression levels glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 1 (HK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA). Elevated HK LDH activity found high-risk tumors. Among isoforms GLUT HK, GLUT1 HK1 expression increased higher tumor risk grade. addition, overexpression glycolytic enzymes M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) LDHA observed GISTs, especially high-risk tumors. results suggest upregulation GLUT1, HK1, PKM2, LDHA may play important role GIST tumorigenesis may useful preoperative prediction malignant potential.
