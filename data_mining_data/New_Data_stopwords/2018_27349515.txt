 AIM: earlier study demonstrated antidiabetic activity zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZON) diabetic rats. present study performed elucidate mechanism antidiabetic action. METHODS: Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, protein kinase B hormone sensitive lipase phosphorylation; glucose transporter 4 translocation glucose uptake; glucose 6 phosphatase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase glucokinase expression; pancreatic beta cell proliferation evaluated ZON treatment cells. RESULT: ZON treatment resulted PKB activation, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inactivation, increased glucose transporter 4 translocation enhanced glucose uptake, decreased glucose 6 phosphatase phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase expression, hormone sensitive lipase inactivation pancreatic beta cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: best knowledge, report first time, pleiotropic antidiabetic effects ZON viz. improved insulin signaling, enhanced glucose uptake, decreased hepatic glucose output, decreased lipolysis enhanced pancreatic beta cell mass.
