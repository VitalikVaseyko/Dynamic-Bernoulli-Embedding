 previously reported usefulness two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed Western blotting sera patients systemic candidiasis detection major Candida albicans antigens (Pitarch et al., Electrophoresis 1999, 20, 1001-1010). identification antigens would useful characterization good markers disease, development efficient diagnostic strategies. work used nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry obtain amino acid sequence information immunogenic proteins previously detected. report cross-species identification antigens matching tandem mass spectrometry data Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins. Using approach, unambiguously identified four C. albicans immunogenic proteins analyzed, namely aconitase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase methionine synthase. Furthermore, report first time aconitase, methionine synthase phosphoglycerate mutase antigenic properties C. albicans.
