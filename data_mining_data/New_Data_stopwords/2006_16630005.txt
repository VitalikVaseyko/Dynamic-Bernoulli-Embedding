 AIMS: study aimed increasing pyruvate productivity multi-vitamin auxotrophic yeast Torulopsis glabrata redirecting ATP production oxidative phosphorylation substrate-level phosphorylation. METHODS RESULTS: examined two strategies decrease activity F0F1-ATPase. strategies inhibit F0F1-ATPase activity addition oligomycin, disrupt F0F1-ATPase screening neomycin-resistant mutant. addition 0.05 mmol l(-1) oligomycin culture broth T. glabrata CCTCC M202019 resulted significantly decreased intracellular ATP level (35.7%) significantly increased glucose consumption rate (49.7%). neomycin-resistant mutant N07 screened selected nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis parent strain T. glabrata CCTCC M202019. Compared parent strain, F0F1-ATPase activity mutant N07 decreased 65%. consequence, intracellular ATP level mutant N07 decreased 24%, resulted decreased growth rate growth yield. expected, glucose consumption rate pyruvate productivity mutant N07 increased 34% 42.9%, respectively. Consistently, activities key glycolytic enzymes mutant N07, including phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, increased 63.7%, 28.8% 14.4%, respectively. addition, activities key enzymes involved electron transfer chain mutant N07 also increased. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired oxidative phosphorylation T. glabrata leads decreased intracellular ATP production, thereby increasing glycolytic flux. SIGNIFICANCE IMPACT STUDY: strategy redirecting ATP production oxidative phosphorylation substrate-level phosphorylation provides alternative approach enhance glycolytic flux eukaryotic micro-organisms.
