 OBJECTIVE: investigate effects ethyl pyruvate (EP) expression proinflammatory related gene proteins mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) renal tissues ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury mice. METHODS: Fifty male BABL/c mice randomly divided sham operation group (n=8), model group (n=10), EP treatment group (n=32). EP treatment group subdivided EP pretreatment group (administration 40 mg/kg EP 30 minutes reproduction model, n=8), 4, 6 12 hours treatment groups (administration 40 mg/kg EP 4, 6 12 hours reproduction model, respectively, n=8 group). Bilateral renal artery occluded microvascular clamp 30 minutes reproduce kidney I/R injury model, kidney harvested 24 hours I/R. mRNA expressions interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) determined real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). changes protein levels MAPKs [extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38MAPK] determined Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Real-time PCR assay showed mRNA expressions IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, HMGB1 renal tissue much higher sham operation group (IL-1beta: 12.05+/-8.08 vs. 3.18+/-1.13, IL-6: 10.26+/-6.85 vs. 0.81+/-0.34, TNF-alpha: 5.83+/-3.85 vs. 0.67+/-0.34, ICAM-1: 3.87+/-2.02 vs. 0.29+/-0.13, HMGB1: 652.82+/-78.50 vs. 112.31+/-32.50, P<0.05); expression EP treatment groups markedly down-regulated model group, especially 12-hour treatment group (0.45+/-0.26, 0.66+/-0.13, 0.21+/-0.11, 0.05+/-0.02, 212.26+/-3.20, respectively, P<0.05). Western blotting analysis revealed expression phosphorylated forms ERK1/2, JNK, p38MAPK proteins significantly higher sham operation group (p-ERK1/2: 1.13+/-0.38 vs. 0.48+/-0.34, p-JNK: 1.40+/-0.15 vs. 0.36+/-0.15, p-p38MAPK: 0.47+/-0.15 vs. 0.21+/-0.17, P<0.05); expression phosphorylated forms ERK1/2, JNK, p38MAPK EP treatment group significantly down-regulated compared model group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: EP effectively protect kidney acute injury produced I/R, may related regulation proinflammatory genes MAPKs renal tissue.
