 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency lead acute hemolytic anemia, chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, neonatal jaundice. Neonatal red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency may cause clinical patterns, ranging extremely severe hemolytic anemia moderate jaundice. authors aimed studying prevalence G6PD PK deficiency among Egyptian neonates pathological indirect hyperbilirubinemia Cairo. case-series study included 69 newborns unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. subjected clinical history, laboratory investigations, e.g., complete blood counts, reticulocytic counts, direct indirect serum bilirubin levels, Coombs tests, qualitative assay G6PD activity methemoglobin reduction test, measurement erythrocytic PK levels. study detected 10 neonates G6PD deficiency, means prevalence G6PD deficiency among Egyptian neonates hyperbilirubinemia 14.4% (21.2% males). G6PD deficiency significantly higher males females (P = .01). authors detected 2 cases PK deficiency, making prevalence deficiency 2.8%. data demonstrate G6PD deficiency important cause neonatal jaundice Egyptians. Neonatal screening deficiency recommended. PK deficiency common cause neonatal jaundice. However, needs investigation larger scale.
