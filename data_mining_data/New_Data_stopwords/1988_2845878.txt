 Chloroquine pH 8.0 1mM [corrected] concentration inhibits 30% glucose consumption ethanol formation yeast cells. 11 glycolytic enzymes assayed, phosphoglycerate kinase pyruvate decarboxylase found sensitive chloroquine. Next sensitive hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. Kinetic studies three kinases studied revealed competitive inhibition chloroquine ATP (hexokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase) ADP (pyruvate kinase).
