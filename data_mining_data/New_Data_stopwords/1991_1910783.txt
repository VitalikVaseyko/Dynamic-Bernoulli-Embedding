 mass activity recovery eight different enzymes (two monomeric, six oligomeric) molecular masses 25,000 240,000 daltons tested HPLC separation three different HPLC instruments (two stainless steel one titanium flow paths). tested proteins known sensitive heavy metal ions. Eight wide pore, ion-exchange columns, two size-exclusion columns two hydrophobic-interaction columns used. stainless steel glass column hardware used three separation modes. elution times 8 12 minutes. almost cases, activity recovery 90% 100% compared control sample incubated chromatographic elution buffer time temperature. severe activity loss (about 30%) observed one ion-exchange column one enzyme. Neither column hardware material HPLC equipment negative effect activity recovery enzymes tested.
