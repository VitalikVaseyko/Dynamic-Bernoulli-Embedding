 pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient blood high levels reticulocytes, degree haemolysis incubation 37 degrees C 48 h halved inclusion adenine medium. decrease haemolysis associated higher ATP level related pH incubation mixture. incorporation adenine nucleotides studied 3 h period similar normal PK-deficient blood. observed increase cellular ATP equivalent shown radioactive measurements synthesized added adenine. Inhibition mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation reticulocytes PK-deficient blood KCN reduced amount adenine taken cells factor 3 altered pattern incorporation nucleotides. 25% adenine entered blood cells converted ATP compared 85% absence cyanide. Despite synthesis small amounts ATP labelled adenine, overall ATP content fell less 50% original level. suggested incubation adenine increased ATP level reticulocytes virtue mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation thereby reducing haemolysis cells.
