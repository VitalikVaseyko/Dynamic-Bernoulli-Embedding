 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase deficiency second-most common hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. four affected patients' pregnancies reported since 1980. CASES: 22-year-old without prior splenectomy experienced severe hemolytic anemia, hematocrit low 19.0%, requiring serial transfusions. developed preeclampsia term delivered cesarean nonreassuring fetal heart rate. Another patient splenectomy experienced chronic low-grade hemolysis, hematocrit ranging 26.4-31.6%, requiring transfusion. delivered vaginally term labor induction fetal growth restriction. CONCLUSION: Despite contrasting maternal courses, preeclampsia, nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, fetal growth restriction, pyruvate kinase deficiency associated good maternal-fetal outcomes.
