 Lysine acetylation plays essential role metabolism. Five individual studies identified large number cellular proteins potentially acetylated. Notably, almost every enzyme involved central metabolic pathways glycolysis, TCA cycle, fat acid metabolism, urea cycle glycogen metabolism, acetylated response nutrition fluctuations. Metabolic reprogramming critical hallmark cancer development. Tumor cells preferentially utilize glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation produce lactate metabolic intermediates even normal oxygen pressure, first noted "Warburg Effect". review focuses recent advances acetylation regulation metabolic enzymes involved Warburg effect, dysfunction acetylation regulation tumorigenesis potential role cancer metabolism therapy.
