 present study tested hypothesis exercise large compared small active muscle mass results higher contraction-induced increase Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase mRNA expression due greater hormonal responses. Furthermore, relative abundance Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase subunit alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3), alpha(4), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3) mRNA human skeletal muscle investigated. two occasions, eight subjects performed one-legged knee extension exercise (L) combined one-legged knee extension bilateral arm cranking (AL) 5.00, 4.25, 3.50, 2.75, 2.00 min separated 3 min rest. Leg exercise power output AL L, heart rate end exercise interval higher AL compared L. One minute exercise, arm venous blood lactate higher AL L. higher level blood epinephrine norepinephrine evident 3 min exercise AL compared L. Nevertheless, none exercise-induced increases alpha(1), alpha(2), beta(1), beta(3) mRNA expression levels higher AL compared L. abundant Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase subunit mRNA level beta(1), expressed 3.4 times alpha(2). Expression alpha(1), beta(2), beta(3) less 5% alpha(2) expression, reliable detection alpha(3) alpha(4) possible. conclusion, activation additional muscle mass result higher exercise-induced increase Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase subunit-specific mRNA.
