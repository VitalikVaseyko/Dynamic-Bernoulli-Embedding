 signals oxygen glucose play important role metabolism, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, embryonic development. Little known interaction two signals. demonstrate cross-talk oxygen glucose regulation L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene expression liver. liver periportal perivenous drop O(2) tension proposed endocrine key regulator zonated gene expression. primary rat hepatocyte cultures expression L-PK gene mRNA protein level induced venous pO(2), whereas glucose-dependent induction occurred predominantly arterial pO(2). shown transient transfection L-PK promoter luciferase glucose response element (Glc(PK)RE) SV40 promoter luciferase gene constructs modulation O(2) glucose-dependent induction occurred Glc(PK)RE L-PK gene promoter. reduction glucose-dependent induction L-PK gene expression venous pO(2) appeared mediated via interference hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) upstream stimulating factor Glc(PK)RE. glucose response element also functioned hypoxia response element confirmed cotransfection assays Glc(PK)RE luciferase gene constructs HIF-1alpha expression vectors. Furthermore, found gel shift supershift assay HIF-1alpha USF-1 USF-2 could bind Glc(PK)RE. findings implicate cross-talk oxygen glucose might fundamental role regulation several physiological pathophysiological processes.
