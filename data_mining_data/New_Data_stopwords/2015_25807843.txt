 Granulomas hallmark mycobacterial disease. Here, demonstrate cell recruitment increased glucose consumption granulomatous infiltrates Mycobacterium avium infection highly dependent interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Mycobacterium avium-infected mice lacking IFN-gamma signalling failed developed significant inflammatory infiltrations lacked characteristic uptake glucose analogue fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). assess role macrophages glucose uptake infected mice selective impairment IFN-gamma signalling macrophage lineage (MIIG mice). Although partial reduction granulomatous areas observed infected MIIG mice, insensitivity macrophages IFN-gamma reduced accumulation FDG. vivo, ex vivo vitro assays showed macrophage activated IFN-gamma displayed increased rates glucose uptake vitro studies showed also increased lactate production increased expression key glycolytic enzymes. Overall, results show activation macrophages IFN-gamma responsible Warburg effect observed organs infected M. avium.
