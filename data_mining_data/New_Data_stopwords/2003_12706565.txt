 paper describes development novel optically interrogated enzyme electrode generic applicability NAD(P) dependent enzymes. example reported employs multi-enzyme pathway comprising enzymes pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase diaphorase. final substrate pathway, dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), immobilised within ultra-thin polymer film o-phenylenediamine, electrochemically polymerised onto conductive gold coating surface support polyethylene sheet. Dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) absorbs within visible region spectrum lambda(max) approximately 600 nm. reduced, molar absorption coefficient wavelength decreases significantly DCPIP effectively becomes colourless (DCPIPH(3)). Ultra-thin layers gold (<10 nm thickness) exhibit optical absorption minimum wavelengths approximately 520 nm therefore light within region spectrum may transmitted relative ease polymer/gold/polyethylene optrode. Results presented within paper show electro-optical sensor may used determine concentrations adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within sample. presence ATP colour change blue colourless observed DCPIP assay performed solution. However, DCPIP immobilised within polymeric film onto surface gold coated electrodes, colour change blue red observed corresponding third redox state DCPIP (DCPIPH).
