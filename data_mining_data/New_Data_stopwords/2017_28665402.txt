 Carriers heterozygous germline BAP1 mutations (BAP1(+/-)) develop cancer. studied plasma 16 BAP1(+/-) individuals 2 families carrying different germline BAP1 mutations 30 BAP1 wild-type (BAP1(WT)) controls families. Plasma samples analyzed liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS), ultra-performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQ-MS), gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). found clear separation metabolic profile BAP1(WT) BAP1(+/-) individuals. confirmed specificity data vitro using 12 cell cultures primary fibroblasts derived skin punch biopsies 12/46 individuals, 6 BAP1(+/-) carriers 6 controls families. BAP1(+/-) fibroblasts displayed increased aerobic glycolysis lactate secretion, reduced mitochondrial respiration ATP production compared BAP1(WT). siRNA-mediated downregulation BAP1 primary BAP1(WT) fibroblasts primary human mesothelial cells, led reduced mitochondrial respiration increased aerobic glycolysis detected primary fibroblasts carriers BAP1(+/-) mutations. plasma cell culture results highly reproducible specifically linked BAP1 status gender, age family, cell type, required intact BAP1 catalytic activity. Accordingly, able build metabolomic model capable predicting BAP1 status 100% accuracy using data human plasma. data provide first experimental evidence supporting hypothesis aerobic glycolysis, also known 'Warburg effect', necessarily occur adaptive process consequence carcinogenesis, rather may also predate malignancy many years facilitate carcinogenesis.
