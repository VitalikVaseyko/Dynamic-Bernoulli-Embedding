 Dysregulation insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor signalling network implicated tumour growth resistance chemotherapy. explored proteomic changes resulting insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulation MCF-7 adenocarcinoma cells function time. Quantitative analysis using iTRAQ reagents 2-D LC-MS/MS analysis three biological replicates resulted identification 899 proteins (p<or=0.05) estimated mean false-positive rate 2.6%. Quantitative protein expression obtained 681 proteins. analysis supervised k-means clustering identified five temporal clusters, submitted FuncAssociate server assign overrepresented gene ontology terms. Proteins associated vesicle transport significantly overrepresented. analyzed data set proteins showing temporal significance using software, extraction analysis differential gene expression, resulting 20 significantly temporally changing proteins (p<or=0.1). significant proteins play roles in, among others, altered glucose metabolism (lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase M1/M2) cellular stress (nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha heat shock (HSC70) proteins). used multiple reaction monitoring validate interesting proteins revealed several differences relative peptide expression corresponding protein isoforms variants.
