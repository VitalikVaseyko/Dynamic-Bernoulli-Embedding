 end-point ADP/NAD+ acid/alkali assay procedure, directly applicable library screening type ATP-utilising/ADP producing enzyme activity, implemented. Typically, ADP production coupled NAD+ co-enzyme formation conventional addition pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. Transformation enzymatically generated NAD+ photometrically active alkali derivative product achieved successive application acidic/alkali treatment steps. assay successfully miniaturized search malate kinase activity structurally-guided library LysC aspartate kinase variants comprising 6,700 clones. screening procedure enabled isolation nine positive variants showing novel kinase activity (L)-malate, best mutant, LysC V115A:E119S:E434V exhibited strong substrate selectivity (L)-malate compared (L)-aspartate (kcat/Km)malate/(kcat/Km)aspartate ratio 86. Double mutants V115A:E119S, V115A:E119C E119S:E434V constructed probe origins stabilising substrate binding energy gains (L)-malate due mutation. introduction less sterically hindering side-chains engineered enzymes carrying E119S V115A mutations increases effective volume available substrate binding catalytic pocket. Improved binding (L)-malate substrate may assisted less hindered movement Phe184 aromatic side-chain. Additional favourable long-range electostatic effects binding arising E434V surface mutation conditionally dependent upon presence V115A mutation close Phe184 active-site.
