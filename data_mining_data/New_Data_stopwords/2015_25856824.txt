 BACKGROUND OBJECTIVE: characterize cellular, immunological, inflammatory response retinal photocoagulation intense rupture laser lesions model retinal degenerative diseases. MATERIALS METHODS: Seven C57BL/6 mice irradiated using 532-nm laser induce 10 retinal burns per eye ruptured Bruch's membrane. Blood drawn saphenous vein 2 months laser treatment. serum run antigen microarrays 85 molecular markers associated retinal degenerative diseases. RESULTS: Rupture laser resulted dramatic changes immunoglobulin reactivity inflammatory markers 2 months laser injury. Approximately two-thirds increased expression one-third decreased expression. Notable markers increased included complement C3, CRP, PKM2, aldolase. CONCLUSION: Rupture laser injury causes change serum inflammatory markers 2 months similar macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, cancer-associated retinopathy. animal model could used biomarker disease stage activity retinal degenerations.
