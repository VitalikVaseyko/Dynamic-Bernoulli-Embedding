 studied effect long-term application corticosterone (CORT) s.c. equivalent cortisol rats, behavior, oxidative energy metabolism brain parietotemporal cortex hippocampus 1-year-old male Wistar rats. data compared results derived long-term low dose intracerebroventricular application diabetogenic drug streptozotocin (STZ) known inhibit function neuronal insulin receptor generating insulin resistant brain state. CORT reduced working reference memory increasingly time running parallel STZ-induced deficit. effect CORT activities glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and, tricarboxylic acid cycle, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase equaled experimental conditions regions studied: significant decreases enzyme activities except lactate dehydrogenase increased three fourfold normal. CORT- STZ-induced marked fall ATP range regions studied. Differences became obvious concentration creatine phosphate parietotemporal cerebral cortex showing decrease CORT obviously due different susceptibility CORT-receptor. discussed CORT STZ may act neuronal insulin receptor similar way. However, studies needed gene expression insulin insulin receptor protein levels clarify exact action CORT neuronal insulin receptor function.
