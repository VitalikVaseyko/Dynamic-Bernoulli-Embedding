 child Italian origin congenital haemolytic anaemia spectrophotometrically undetectable erythrocyte adenylate kinase (AK) activity. parents brother approximately 50% normal AK activity, AK electrophoresis red blood cell (RBC) crude extract cellulose acetate strips showed presence normal allele AK1-1. AK band detected AK electrophoresis proband, erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG) glutathione (GSH) concentrations normal whereas adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, pyruvate kinase (PK) glucose-6P-dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities increased, reflecting high reticulocyte count (6.9%). evident enzymatic defect detected standard procedures. Analysis AK gene exons, based polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), clearly showed abnormality fragment containing exon 6. subsequent sequence analysis abnormal fragment revealed homozygous heterozygous A-->G substitutions proband parents brother respectively codon 164, corresponding tyrosine-->cysteine substitution AK protein.
