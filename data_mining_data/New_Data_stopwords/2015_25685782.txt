 early twentieth century, Otto Heinrich Warburg described elevated rate glycolysis occurring cancer cells, even presence atmospheric oxygen (the Warburg effect). Recently became therapeutically interesting strategy considered emerging hallmark cancer. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) one key transcription factors play major roles tumor glycolysis could directly trigger Warburg effect. Thus, inhibit HIF-1-depended Warburg effect assist cancer therapy becoming hot issue cancer research. fact, HIF-1 upregulates glucose transporters (GLUT) induces expression glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase. small molecules natural origin used GLUT, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase isoform M2 inhibitors could represent major challenge field cancer treatment. compounds aim suppress tumor hypoxia induced glycolysis process suppress cell energy metabolism enhance susceptibility tumor cells radio- chemotherapy. review, highlight role natural compounds regulating tumor glycolysis, main focus glycolysis hypoxic tumor microenvironment.
