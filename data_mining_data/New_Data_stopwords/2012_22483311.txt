 Although researchers pursuing "disease modifying" medications slow stop Parkinson's disease (PD) progression, myriad agents protective properties cell cultures animal models yielded treatments clinical practice. Developing safe effective treatments disease-modifying/neuroprotective mechanisms action identifying patients pre-motor phase challenge. implication tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), enzyme catalyzes formation L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, pathogenesis PD different levels makes promising candidate developing efficient treatment based correcting bypassing enzyme deficiency. TH also key enzyme immunorreactivity PD models used assess efficacy novel disease-modifying medications. PD animal models genetic: alpha-synuclein models, parkin (PINK 1 DJ1) leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 pharmacological neurotoxic: reserpine, 6-hydroxydopamine, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine, rotenone, paraquat/maneb, trichloroethylene. review focused state art PD models, relationship TH, potential neuroprotective agents treat PD. latter include gene therapy, transplantation, erythropoietin, natural phenolic compounds, doxycycline, ethyl pyruvate, 9-methyl-beta-carboline, vascular endothelial growth factor, simvastatin, zonisamide, modafinil, melatonin, cannabinoids, rottlerin, fluoxetine, paroxetine, coenzyme Q10, N-acetylcysteine vaccines like Bacille Calmette-Guerin, different proposed mechanisms action. Also note link hypovitaminosis neurodegeneration opening new perspectives research TH genes PD models treated vitamin D. Translational scientists contribute better understanding pathogenesis PD lead effective treatments.
