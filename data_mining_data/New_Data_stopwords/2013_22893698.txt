 continuous assembly disassembly focal adhesions required efficient cell spreading migration. G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) multidomain protein whose dynamic localization sites cytoskeletal remodeling critically involved regulation processes. provide evidence subcellular localization GIT1 regulated protein kinase D3 (PKD3) direct phosphorylation serine 46. GIT1 phosphorylation serine 46 abrograted PKD3 depletion, thereby identifying GIT1 first specific substrate kinase. GIT1 S46D phosphomimetic mutant localized motile, paxillin-positive cytoplasmic complexes, whereas phosphorylation-deficient GIT1 S46A enriched focal adhesions. propose phosphorylation GIT1 serine 46 PKD3 represents molecular switch GIT1 localization, paxillin trafficking, cellular protrusive activity regulated.
