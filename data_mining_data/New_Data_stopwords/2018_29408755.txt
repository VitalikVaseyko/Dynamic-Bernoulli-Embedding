 BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) exploits reaction photosensitizer irradiated light generate potentially therapeutic reactive oxygen species singlet oxygen cancer cells. reported several sugar-conjugated chlorins express stronger antitumor effects PDT talaporfin sodium (TS), second-generation photosensitizer clinically used Japan. study, developed novel glucose-conjugated chlorin e6 (G-chlorin e6) evaluated antitumor effects. METHODS: G-chlorin e6 synthesized core photosensitizer chlorin e6 conjugated glucose. measured half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) compare PDT effects G-chlorin e6 TS, flow cytometry performed examine accumulation G-chlorin e6 cancer cells. also compared accumulation G-chlorin e6 normal immortalized esophageal epithelial cells esophageal cancer cells. Antitumor effects G-chlorin e6 PDT finally analyzed allograft tumor mouse models. RESULTS: PDT vitro using G-chlorin e6 elicited 9, 000-34,000 times stronger antitumor effects TS, 70-190 times G-chlorin e6 accumulated TS flow cytometry. G-chlorin e6 accumulated selectively esophageal cancer cells esophageal immortalized epithelial cells, allograft model, PDT G-chlorin e6 showed strong antitumor effects 40% complete response (CR) rate. CONCLUSIONS: G-chlorin e6 showed excellent tumor selectivity, PDT using G-chlorin e6 revealed strongest anti-tumor effects among sugar-conjugated chlorins studied. G-chlorin e6 considered best photosensitizer next-generation PDT.
