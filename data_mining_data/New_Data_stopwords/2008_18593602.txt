 potential importance carbohydrates amino acids fuels periods fasting aestivation African lungfish, Protopterus dolloi, examined. significant decreases tissue glycogen levels observed following 60 days fasting aestivation, suggesting lungfish may undergo 'glycogen sparing'. Yet glycogenolysis may important aestivation based differing responses two flux-generating enzymes glycolytic pathway, hexokinase (HK) pyruvate kinase (PK). PK required glycogen breakdown whereas HK not. HK activity significantly down-regulated heart gill tissues aestivation, PK activity sustained. significant negative correlation activity HK glucose levels heart aestivating lungfish suggests HK may regulated glucose concentrations. indication anaerobic glycolytic flux aestivation lactate accumulate tissues examined, significant induction lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)activity observed. increase glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) aspartate aminotransferase (Asp-AT) activities liver aestivating P. dolloi suggests energy may obtained via increased aminoacid catabolism, leading generation tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. findings indicate importance carbohydrate amino acid fuel stores aestivation aphylogenetically ancient, air-breathing fish.
