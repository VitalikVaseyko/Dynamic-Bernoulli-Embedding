 Transcription liver type pyruvate kinase lipogenesis enzyme genes induced high carbohydrate liver. found novel protein factor rat liver nuclei binds glucose response element (CACGTG motifs) pyruvate kinase gene (Liu, Z. , Thompson, K. S., Towle, H. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 12787-12795) "insulin response element" fatty acid synthase gene. amounts DNA-binding protein, termed "glucose response element binding protein" (GRBP) nuclear extract, increased liver high carbohydrate diet decreased starvation, high fat, high protein diet. GRBP also occurs cytosols liver dependent carbohydrate. nuclear cytosolic GRBP showed similar properties, except former resistant thermal inactivation latter. Kinetics glucose activation cytosolic GRBP primary culture hepatocytes indicated half-maximum activation achieved 6 h, glucose concentration required maximum activation GRBP approximately 12 mM. Dibutyryl-cAMP, okadaic acid, forskolin inhibited glucose activation GRBP liver pyruvate kinase transcription. results suggested GRBP may factor recognizes glucose response motif site may involved mediating carbohydrate response pyruvate kinase gene.
