 Liver X receptors (LXRs) nuclear receptors established roles cholesterol, lipid, carbohydrate metabolism, although function adipocytes well characterized. Increased adipose tissue mass obesity associated increased adipocyte lipolysis. Fatty acids (FA) generated lipolysis oxidized mitochondrial beta-oxidation, reesterified, released adipocyte. latter results higher circulating levels free FAs, turn causing obesity-related metabolic complications. However, mitochondrial beta-oxidation least part counteract increased output FA circulation. study, provide evidence activation LXRs up-regulates mitochondrial beta-oxidation human murine white adipocytes. also show expression kinase regulating cellular fuel switch, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), up-regulated LXR agonist GW3965 vitro differentiated human primary adipocytes differentiated murine 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, activation LXR causes PDK4-dependent phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thereby decreasing activity attenuating glucose oxidation. specificity GW3965 effect oxidation confirmed RNA interference targeting LXRs. propose LXR important role regulation substrate oxidation switch lipids carbohydrates cellular fuel human murine white adipocytes.
