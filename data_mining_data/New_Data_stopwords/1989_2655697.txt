 immediate product pyruvate kinase catalyzed phosphorylation beta-hydroxypyruvate enol tartronate semialdehyde phosphate (TSP). reaction pH profile phosphorylation pyruvate pK's 8.2 9.7 observed H2O. enol tautomerizes solution aldehyde, turn becomes hydrated. 31P NMR spectra indicate enol resonates approximately 1 ppm upfield hydrated aldehyde. following tautomerization spectrophotometrically 240 nm, found independent pH (0.2 min-1 pH 6 water), except 2-fold slower pK phosphate group (6.3 H2O 6.7 D2O). 3.6-fold slower D2O. TSP reduced NaBH4, approximately 50% product D-2-phosphoglyceric acid (substrate enolase). Thus, immediate product phosphorylation rection enol TSP, eventual product D,L-TSP. enol aldehyde forms TSP found potent inhibitors yeast enolase apparent Ki values 100 nM 5 microM, respectively. However, since aldehyde form 95-99% hydrated [Stubbe, J., & Abeles, R. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 5505], true Ki aldehyde species 50-250 nM. enol TSP shows slow binding behavior, expected intermediate analogue, t1/2 process approximately 15 (k = 0.046 s-1) initial Ki approximately 200 nM.
