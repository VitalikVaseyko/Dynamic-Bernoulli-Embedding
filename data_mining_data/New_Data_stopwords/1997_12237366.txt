 Nia30(145) transformants low nitrate reductase activity provide vivo screen identify processes regulated nitrate. Nia30(145) resembles nitrate-limited wild-type plants respect growth rate protein amino acid content accumulates large amounts nitrate grown high nitrate. transcripts nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase, cytosolic glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase increased; NR nitrite reductase activity increased leaves roots; glutamine synthetase activity increased roots. transcripts phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase increased; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity increased; malate, citrate, isocitrate, [alpha]-oxoglutarate accumulated leaves roots. decrease ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase transcript activity, starch decreased leaves roots. adding 12 mM nitrate nitrate-limited Nia30(145), transcripts NR phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase increased, transcripts ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase decreased within 2 4 hr, respectively. Starch remobilized almost rate wild-type plants, even though growth stimulated Nia30(145). proposed nitrate acts signal initiate coordinated changes carbon nitrogen metabolism.
