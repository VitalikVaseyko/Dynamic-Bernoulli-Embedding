 physical-chemical principles governing interactions enzymes common metabolic products presented. Methods comparing dissociation rates metabolic product rates enzyme-enzyme interaction given. Using muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) creatine kinase (CK) example, shown probability forming enzyme-product-enzyme complex much greater rate ATP dissociation either enzyme. Experimental evidence using 31P-NMR demonstrates presence pyruvate kinase creatine kinase, exchange phosphate phosphocreatine phosphoenolpyruvate without change intermediate, ATP. confirms formation PK.ATP.CK complex aqueous solution without enzyme attachment substructure. Enzymes capable forming mobile clusters defined diazymes, criteria formation given. metabolic implications diazymes discussed.
