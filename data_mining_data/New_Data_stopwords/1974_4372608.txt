 Chick-embryo cells, transformed Rous sarcoma virus, show enhanced rates sugar transport glycolysis. Determination intracellular concentrations glycolytic intermediates suggests enhanced glycolytic flux due increased activities hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase, (ATP:D-fructose-1-phosphate 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.56), pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40), directly increased glucose transport. conclusion supported finding intracellular concentration free glucose decreased, rather increased, transformed cells. present observations suggest increased glycolytic flux related increased rate phosphorylation glucose, hexokinase transformed cells least partly released normal control mechanism involving feedback inhibition glucose-6-P.
