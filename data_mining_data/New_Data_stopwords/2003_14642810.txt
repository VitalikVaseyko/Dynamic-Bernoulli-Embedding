 Previously, found novel protein factor livers rats fed high-carbohydrate diet, binds major late transcription factor (MLTF)-like site within glucose response element (GRE) liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene [J. Biol. Chem. 274 (1999) 1100]. factor, termed glucose response element binding protein (GRBP), exists liver cytosol nucleus. order identify GRBP, purified homogeneity cytosolic GRBP rat liver extract identified Translin/Trax heteromeric complex. Based partial amino acid sequences, cloned full-length rat cDNAs Translin Trax. nuclear cytosolic Translin/Trax complex large polymers 240 420 kDa, respectively. molar ratio Translin/Trax polymers 2:1 liver cytosols. nuclear cytosolic Translin/Trax complexes well expressed His-tagged Translin bound double- single-stranded MLTF sites GRE L-PK gene avidly single-stranded Bcl-CL1, initially thought specific Translin. findings indicate Translin/Trax complex constitutes previously described GRBP, complex binds GRE L-PK gene high affinity. precise physiologic role GRBP, however, remains unclear.
