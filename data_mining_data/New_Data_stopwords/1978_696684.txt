 Genetic polymorphism exists erythrocytic pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient hemolytic anemia, briefly described. Destruction erythrocytes varied extent, mechanisms different PK-deficient polymorphic persons investigated similar. paradoxical post-splenectomy reticulocytosis regularly occurred. Qualitative enzymatic differences, biochemistry, measurements erythrocytic destruction made several PK variants. 51Cr autologous cross-transfusions PK-deficient erythrocytes volunteers showed multimodel regression lines several erythrocytic cohorts. 59Felabeled PK-deficient reticulocytes donated PK-deficient splenectomized subjects transfused 20 hours splenectomy two PK-deficient infants hemolysis, two adult volunteers autoimmune thrombocytopenia. highest reticulocyte concentration organ initially within spleen. Radioiron-labeled erythrocytes cytologic data showed large splenic reticulocyte pools. Splenic macrophages ingesting reticulocytes erythrocytes seen light electron microscopy splenic pulp. cyanide additives inhibiting reticulocyte oxidative phosphorylation, bizarre erythrocytic cytologic configuration found scanning electron microscopy. studies PK-mutant subjects PK-deficient erythrocytic hemolysis showed age dependent destruction erythrocytes. Bimodal Cr survival data suggested reticuloendothelial removal short-lived erythrocytes reticulocytes. transfusions radioironlabeled PK reticulocytes data obtained scanning electron microscopy suggested spleen initial hostile organ destroying cohort susceptible erythrocytes, prinicpally reticulocytes.
