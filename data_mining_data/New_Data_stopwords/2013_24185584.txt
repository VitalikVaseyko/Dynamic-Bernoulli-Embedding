 antiproliferative differentiation potential anthocyanin-rich strawberry fruit crude extracts (SE) investigated B16-F10 murine melanoma cells. Treatment melanoma cells SE produced remarkable reduction cell proliferation, paralleled lowering intracellular levels polyamine, enhancement tissue transglutaminase (TG2, EC 2.3.2.13) activity (used differentiation marker). gain insight profiling altered protein expression potential biomarker SE action melanoma cells, analysis proteomic profile performed treated B16-F10 cells, compared control. Following SE treatment, 30 proteins resulted up-regulated, 87 proteins down-regulated. particular proteins overexpressed cancer cells, involved tumor progression metabolism, down-regulated. possibility SE may affect Warburg effect B16-F10 melanoma cells discussed.
