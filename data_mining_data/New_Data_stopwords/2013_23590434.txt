 SIGNIFICANCE: Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) nuclear-encoded mitochondria-matrix-localized oxidation-reduction (redox) enzyme regulates cellular redox homeostasis. Cellular redox processes known regulate proliferative quiescent growth states. Therefore, MnSOD mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) believed critical regulators quiescent cells' entry cell cycle exit proliferative cycle back quiescent state. RECENT ADVANCES/CRITICAL ISSUES: Recent evidence suggests intracellular redox environment fluctuates cell cycle, shifting toward oxidized status mitosis. MnSOD activity higher G0/G1 cells compared S, G2 phases. cell division, MnSOD activity increases G1 phase daughter generation. periodic fluctuation MnSOD activity cell cycle inversely correlates cellular superoxide levels well glucose oxygen consumption. Based inverse correlation MnSOD activity glucose consumption cell cycle, proposed MnSOD central molecular player "Warburg effect." FUTURE DIRECTIONS: general, loss MnSOD activity results aberrant proliferation. better understanding MnSOD mitochondrial ROS-dependent cell cycle processes may lead novel approaches overcome aberrant proliferation. Since ROS deleterious (pathological) beneficial (physiological) effects, proposed "eustress" used discussing ROS processes regulate normal physiological functions, "oxidative stress" used discuss deleterious effects ROS.
