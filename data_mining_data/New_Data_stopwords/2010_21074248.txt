 PI3K PTEN lipid phosphatase control level cellular phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, activator AKT kinases promotes cell growth survival. Mutations activating AKT commonly observed human cancers. report ENTPD5, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme, upregulated cell lines primary human tumor samples active AKT. ENTPD5 hydrolyzes UDP UMP promote protein N-glycosylation folding ER. Knockdown ENTPD5 PTEN null cells causes ER stress loss growth factor receptors. ENTPD5, together cytidine monophosphate kinase-1 adenylate kinase-1, constitute ATP hydrolysis cycle converts ATP AMP, resulting compensatory increase aerobic glycolysis known Warburg effect. growth PTEN null cells inhibited vitro mouse xenograft tumor models. ENTPD5 therefore integral part PI3K/PTEN regulatory loop potential target anticancer therapy.
