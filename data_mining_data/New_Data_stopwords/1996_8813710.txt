 Glycogen content well glycolytic, gluconeogenic fatty acid synthesis enzyme activities monitored young adult male rats fed diets differing fat content: 11% (low), 22% (medium) 42% (high) total energy fat. results showed significant differences responses young adult rats changes dietary fat carbohydrate. young animals, increasing dietary fat decreased total liver glycogen phosphorylase (GP), pyruvate kinase (PK), glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme (ME), ATP-citrate lyase (ATP-CL) fatty acid synthase (FAS). Increasing dietary fat also affected enzyme levels tissues: hexokinase (HK) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activities decreased whereas skeletal muscle PK activity increased. pattern enzyme changes similar livers fed adults exception liver GP affected dietary manipulations. Overnight food deprivation decreased liver glucokinase (GK), ME, ATP-CL, FAS activities increased liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) phosphofructokinase young adult animals. young animals, food deprivation also: (i) reduced liver GK PK, (ii) increased kidney PEPCK, (iii) decreased muscle PEPCK (iv) decreased kidney PDH. Food-deprived adults increased skeletal muscle PEPCK kidney glycogen synthetase well decreased kidney PEPCK muscle GP activity. differences suggest young animals somewhat responsive changes dietary manipulations. also show overnight food restriction causes profound metabolic re-organization younger older animals.
