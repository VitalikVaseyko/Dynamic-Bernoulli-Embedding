 reported mast cell degranulation inversely related enzymatic activity M(2)-type pyruvate kinase (M(2)PK). study shows activation high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) evokes sequential dual regulation M(2)PK, i.e., immediate decrement followed slow phase increment enzymatic activities. Changes activities M(2)PK mast cell degranulation showed similar time course antigenic stimulation FcepsilonRI. immediate inhibition M(2)PK involved tyrosine phosphorylation, subsequently led cellular accumulation glycolytic intermediates, including fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBP), feedforward activator M(2)PK. cellular levels FBP increased, enzymatic acitivity M(2)PK mast cell degranulation slowly returned near basal levels. A-Raf, exogenously introduced RBL-2H3 cells, phosphorylated M(2)PK serine residues, elevated enzyme activities M(2)PK, resulted inhibition degranulation. results suggest dual regulation M(2)PK involves phosphorylation M(2)PK accumulation feedforward activator M(2)PK plays important roles control mast cell degranulation.
