 Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) key determinants cancer progression. prostate carcinoma (PCa), CAFs induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) metabolic reprogramming PCa cells towards oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), promoting tumor growth metastatic dissemination. herein establish novel role pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), established effector Warburg-like glycolytic behavior, OXPHOS metabolism induced CAFs. Indeed, CAFs promote PKM2 post-translational modifications, cysteine oxidation Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, allowing nuclear migration PKM2 formation trimeric complex hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) transcriptional repressor Differentially Expressed Chondrocytes-1 (DEC1). DEC1 recruitment mandatory downregulating miR205 expression, thereby fostering EMT execution metabolic switch toward OXPHOS. Furthermore, analysis cohort PCa patients reveals significant positive correlation PKM2 nuclear localization cancer aggressiveness, thereby validating vitro observations. Crucially, vitro vivo pharmacological targeting PKM2 nuclear translocation using DASA-58, well metformin, impairs metastatic dissemination PCa cells SCID mice. study indicates impairing metabolic tumor:stroma interplay targeting PKM2/OXPHOS axis, may valuable novel therapeutic approach aggressive prostate carcinoma.
