 Diurnal variation hepatic levels lactate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, oxaloacetate, ketone bodies, alanine, serine, glycine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, valine, urea, adenine nucleotides inorganic phosphate studied rats adapted high protein, carbohydrate-free diet 24 days. circadian rhythms differed relation controls (10% protein diet); many merely different amplitudes, inverted, exhibited drastically altered patterns. Cytoplasmic redox state exhibited nearly similar variations phosphorylation state differed primarily amplitude whereas mitochondrial redox state highly depressed absorptive phase. metabolic regulation implied results discussed relation circadian variations plasma insulin glucagon concentrations, pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities previously reported.
