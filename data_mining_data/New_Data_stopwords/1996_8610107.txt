 According amyloid hypothesis pathogenesis Alzheimer disease, beta-amyloid peptide (betaA) directly affects neurons, leading neurodegeneration tau phosphorylation. rat hippocampal culture, betaA exposure activates tau protein kinase I/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (TPKI/GSK-3beta), phosphorylates tau protein Alzheimer disease-like forms, resulting neuronal death. elucidate mechanism betaA-induced neuronal death, searched substrates TPKI/GSK-3beta two-hybrid system identified pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), converts pyruvate acetyl-CoA mitochondria. PDH phosphorylated inactivated TPKI/GSK-3beta vitro also betaA-treated hippocampal cultures, resulting mitochondrial dysfunction, would contribute neuronal death. cholinergic neurons, betaA impaired acetylcholine synthesis without affecting choline acetyltransferase activity, suggests PDH inactivated betaA-induced TPKI/GSK-3beta. Thus, TPKI/GSK-3beta regulates PDH participates energy metabolism acetylcholine synthesis. results suggest TPKI/GSK-3beta plays key role pathogenesis Alzheimer disease.
