 Two new kinetic analyses mammalian hexokinases presented, permit one study regulation enzymes product inhibition. One method uses pyruvate kinase-coupled assay glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. methods give simple linear plots, indicate magnesium-ATP complex overcomes glucose 6-phosphate inhibition competitively, atypical kinetics. new regulation coefficient (Kr) defined shown that, assay methods, reciprocals slopes simple linear plots proportional Kr.[Mg.ATP].NADP, NAD, found powerful inhibitor pig heart hexokinase.
