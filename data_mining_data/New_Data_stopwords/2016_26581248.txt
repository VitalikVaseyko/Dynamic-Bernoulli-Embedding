 Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus develops acid tolerance response subjected acid stress conditions, induction enzymes associated carbohydrate metabolism. study, pyk gene encoding pyruvate kinase over-expressed heterologous host Lactococcus lactis NZ9000, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed successful expression gene NZ9000. survival rate Pyk-overproducing strain 45-fold higher control acid stress condition (pH 4.0). order determine transcription factor (TF) regulates expression pyk bacterial one-hybrid, constructed TF library including 65 TFs L. bulgaricus. Western blotting indicated TFs library could successfully expressed host strains. Subsequently, promoter pfk-pyk operon L. bulgaricus identified 5'-RACE PCR. bait plasmid pH3U3-p01 carrying deletion fragment pfk-pyk promoter captured catabolite control protein (CcpA) could regulate expression pyk binding putative catabolite-responsive element (5'-TGTAAGCCCTAACA-3') upstream -35 region. Real-time qPCR analysis revealed transcription pyk positively regulated CcpA. first report identifying TF pyk L. bulgaricus, provide new insight regulatory network.
