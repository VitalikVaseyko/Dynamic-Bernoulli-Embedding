 Pressure overload (PO) first causes cardiac hypertrophy heart failure (HF), associated sex differences cardiac morphology function. aimed identify genes may cause HF-related sex differences. used transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mouse model leading hypertrophy without sex differences cardiac function 2 weeks, sex differences hypertrophy 6 9 weeks TAC. Cardiac gene expression analyzed 2 weeks surgery. Deregulated genes classified functional gene ontology (GO) categories used pathway analysis. Classical marker genes hypertrophy similarly upregulated sexes (alpha-actin, ANP, BNP, CTGF). Thirty-five genes controlling mitochondrial function (PGC-1, cytochrome oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) lower expression males compared females TAC. Genes encoding ribosomal proteins genes associated extracellular matrix remodeling exhibited relative higher expression males (collagen 3, matrix metalloproteinase 2, TIMP2, TGFbeta2, twofold) TAC. confirmed 87% gene expression real-time polymerase chain reaction. GO classification, female-specific genes related mitochondria metabolism males matrix biosynthesis. Promoter studies confirmed upregulation PGC-1 E2. Less downregulation metabolic genes female hearts increased protein synthesis capacity deregulation matrix remodeling male hearts characterize sex-specific early response PO. differences could contribute subsequent sex differences cardiac function HF.
