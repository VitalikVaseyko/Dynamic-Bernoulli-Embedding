 pH-regulated expression acid (AXP) alkaline (AEP) extracellular proteases yeast Yarrowia lipolytica 148 analysed. Expression batch continuous cultures determined mRNA level Northern blotting, enzyme level enzyme assays Western blotting. Culture pH regulated AEP AXP expression predominantly level mRNA content. Highest levels AEP mRNA detected pH 6.5 whereas highest levels AXP mRNA detected pH 5.5. pH values either side maxima AEP AXP expression progressively down-regulated. enzymes, variation mRNA levels culture pH occurred progressively rather discrete steps. AXP expression occur pH 7.0. degree AEP expression occurred pH values tested two unrelated strains Y. lipolytica.
