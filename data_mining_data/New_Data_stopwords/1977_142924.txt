 Three control point enzymes Embden-Meyerhof pathway, hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK), measured individual hypothalamic nuclei 5-day estrous cycle adult rats quantitative histochemical methods. PK levels, low proestrus, rise maximum activity estrus; rise significantly greater days cycle lateral preoptic area (LP), ventromedial pars medialis (VMM) pars lateralis (VML) posterior hypothalamic (Post) nuclei. HK activity also rises low proestrous levels cycle but, contrast PK, reaches maximum activity diestrus-1 (D-1) diestrus-2 (D-2). PFK showed variable changes estrous cycle peaks occurring estrus nuclei diestrus others, changes significantly different. metabolic changes occur specific hypothalamic nuclei shown electrical stimulation, lesion production, stereotaxic hormone implantation localization luteinizing hormone-releasing factor experiments important role reproductive physiology sexual behavior.
