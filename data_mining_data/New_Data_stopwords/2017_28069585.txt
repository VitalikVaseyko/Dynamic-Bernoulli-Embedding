 High mobility group proteins (HMGs) second abundant chromatin proteins exert global genomic functions establishment active inactive chromatin domains. interaction nucleosomes, transcription factors, nucleosome-remodeling machines histones, HMGs family proteins contribute fine tuning transcription response rapid environmental changes. Mammalian high mobility group Bs (HMGBs) characterized two tandem HMG box domains followed long acidic tail. Recent studies demonstrated high expression HMGBs found many cancers, prostate, kidney, ovarian, gastric cancers. However, roles pancreatic cancer seldom reported. study, assessed diagnostic prognostic values HMGBs proteins, including HMGB1, HMGB2, HMGB3, pancreatic cancer Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. results demonstrated HMGB2 predicted poor prognosis pancreatic cancer. vitro studies demonstrated silencing HMGB2 inhibited cell proliferation viability. Mechanistically, results demonstrated silencing HMGB2 decreased hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) protein level inhibited HIF1alpha-mediated glycolysis process. analysis indicated HIF1alpha-targeted glycolytic genes, including GLUT1, HK2, LDHA, prognostic factors positively correlated HMGB2 expression. Taken together, discovered new prognostic predictive markers pancreatic cancer, shed light novel function HMGB2 glycolytic control cancer.
