 effects acute endurance running metabolic profiles rat skeletal muscle studied. Male Wistar strain rats continuously run treadmill 1 h (speed, 35 m/min; grade, 0 degrees). Soleus (SOL) extensor digitorum longus (EDL) removed 30-min running, 0, 1, 6, 24, 48, 72 h post-exercise, enzymes activity (CK, LDH, PFK, PK, SDH, MDH) substrates contents (glycogen pyruvate) measured biochemically. time course enzyme activities showed two distinct patterns: CK, LDH, SDH, MDH showed two peaks, 0 24 h post-exercise, PFK PK showed one peak 0 h post-exercise. activities glycolytic enzymes CK EDL oxidative enzymes SOL showed marked changes exercise. glycogen level lowest 0 h post-exercise muscles recovered resting level 24 h post-exercise. Pyruvate increased running showed highest value 1 h post-exercise. Increased oxidative capacity skeletal muscle response acute endurance exercise dropped gradually resting level 48 h post-exercise. endurance exercise may induce flexible adaptation oxidative capacity within skeletal muscle. conclude respective time course enzyme activities must considered discussing metabolic changes occur acute endurance exercise.
