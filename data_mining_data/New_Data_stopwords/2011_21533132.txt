 BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (METH), abused illicit drug, disrupts many cellular processes, including energy metabolism, spermatogenesis, maintenance oxidative status. However, many components molecular underpinnings METH toxicity yet established. Network analyses integrated proteomic, transcriptomic metabolomic data particularly well suited identifying cellular responses toxins, METH, might otherwise obscured numerous dynamic changes induced. METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: used network analyses proteomic transcriptomic data evaluate pathways Drosophila melanogaster affected acute METH toxicity. METH exposure caused changes expression genes involved energy metabolism, suggesting Warburg-like effect (aerobic glycolysis), normally associated cancerous cells. Therefore, tested hypothesis carbohydrate metabolism plays important role METH toxicity. agreement hypothesis, observed increased dietary sugars partially alleviated toxic effects METH. systems analysis also showed METH impacted genes proteins known associated muscular homeostasis/contraction, maintenance oxidative status, oxidative phosphorylation, spermatogenesis, iron calcium homeostasis. results also provide numerous candidate genes METH-induced dysfunction spermatogenesis, previously characterized molecular level. CONCLUSION: results support overall hypothesis METH causes toxic syndrome characterized altered carbohydrate metabolism, dysregulation calcium iron homeostasis, increased oxidative stress, disruption mitochondrial functions.
