 Glycolytic enzymes group sarcoplasmic enzymes responsible extraction energy available carbohydrates. glycolytic pathway consists 10 enzyme-catalyzed steps. Fragments identified study, within range 1100-2600 Da, correspond glycogen phosphorylase enzyme, catalyzes rate limiting step degradation glycogen, enzymes catalyze steps 6-10 glycolysis (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, respectively), lactate dehydrogenase, catalyzes interconversion pyruvate lactate. total 45 specific fragments enzymes resulting processing dry-cured ham reported first time work. study evidences intense proteolysis occurring sarcoplasmic fraction dry-cured ham well facilitates choice adequate tools identification naturally generated peptides comparison Paragon Mascot search engines, together UniProt NCBInr databases.
