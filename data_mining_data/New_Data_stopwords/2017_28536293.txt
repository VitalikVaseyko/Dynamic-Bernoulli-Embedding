 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist rosiglitazone (Rosi) appears provide protection organ dysfunction endotoxaemia. examined potential benefits Rosi skeletal muscle protein maintenance carbohydrate metabolism lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxaemia. Sprague-Dawley rats fed either standard chow (control) standard chow containing Rosi (8.5 +/- 0.1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) 2 weeks 24 h continuous intravenous infusion LPS (15 mug.kg(-1).h(-1)) saline. Rosi blunted LPS-induced increases muscle tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA 70% (P<0.05) 64% (P<0.01) respectively. Furthermore, Rosi suppressed LPS-induced reduction phosphorylated AKT phosphorylated Forkhead box (FOXO) 1 protein, well up-regulation muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1; P<0.01) mRNA LPS-induced increase 20S proteasome activity (P<0.05). Accordingly, LPS reduced muscle protein:DNA ratio ( approximately 30%, P<0.001), Rosi offset. Increased muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA (P<0.001) muscle lactate accumulation (P<0.001) endotoxaemia suppressed Rosi. Thus, pre-treatment Rosi reduced muscle cytokine accumulation blunted muscle protein loss lactate accumulation endotoxaemia, least part reducing activation molecular events known increase muscle protein breakdown mitochondrial pyruvate use.
