 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4) regulate glucose oxidation inhibitory phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Immunoblot analysis antibodies raised recombinant PDK isoforms demonstrated changes PDK isoform expression response experimental hyperthyroidism (100 microg/100 g body weight; 3 days) selective fast-twitch vs slow-twitch skeletal muscle PDK2 expression increased fast-twitch skeletal muscle (the anterior tibialis) (by 1. 6-fold; P<0.05) slow-twitch muscle (the soleus). PDK4 protein expression increased experimental hyperthyroidism muscle types, greater response anterior tibialis (4.2-fold increase; P<0.05) soleus (3.2-fold increase; P<0.05). hyperthyroidism-associated up-regulation PDK4 expression observed conjunction suppression skeletal-muscle PDC activity, suppression glucose uptake/phosphorylation, measured vivo conscious unrestrained rats (using 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose technique). propose increased PDK isoform expression contributes pathology hyperthyroidism PDC inactivation facilitating operation glucose --> lactate --> glucose (Cori) glucose --> alanine --> glucose cycles. also propose enhanced relative expression pyruvate-insensitive PDK isoform (PDK4) skeletal muscle hyperthyroidism uncouples glycolytic flux pyruvate oxidation, sparing pyruvate non-oxidative entry tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, thereby supporting entry acetyl-CoA (derived fatty acid oxidation) TCA cycle.
