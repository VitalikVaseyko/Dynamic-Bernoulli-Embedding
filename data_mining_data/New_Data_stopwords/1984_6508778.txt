 proposed (Grosse et al. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 603, 142-156) membrane-bound creatine kinase ATP-dependent Na+ pump form functional complex cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. model ADP produced Na+ pump sites would rephosphorylated creatine kinase preferential delivery back Na+ pump. reexamined hypothesis find conditions active Na+ transport stimulated ATP produced sarcolemmal creatine kinase. However, characteristics stimulation different stimulation produced added soluble ATP-regenerating system (phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase). Thus, unable detect coupling Na+ pump sarcolemmal creatine kinase.
