 Glycerate kinase (GK; EC 2.7.1.31) maize (Zea mays L.) leaves purified sequence ammonium-sulfate precipitations chromatography diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, Sephadex G-75SF dye ligand (Green A) columns. purest preparation almost 1300-fold enriched specific activity 68 mumol . min(-1) . (mg protein) (-1). enzyme monomer relative molecular mass (Mr) 44 kDa (kdalton) determined gel filtration, electrophoresis dissociating conditions immunoblots. enzyme weakly recognized polyclonal antibodies purified spinach GK, indicating substantial differences molecular structure two proteins. Highly reducing conditions stabilized GK activity required activation crude leaf enzyme. enzyme broad pH optimum 6.8-8.5, formed 3-phosphoglycerate ADP reaction products. Apparent K ms D-glycerate Mg-ATP 0.11 0.25 mM, respectively. enzyme strongly affected number phosphoesters, especially 3-phosphoglycerate (K i= 0.36 mM), fructose bisphosphates nucleoside bisphosphates. Inhibition 3-phosphoglycerate competitive Mg-ATP noncompetitive D-glycerate. Pyruvate found noncompetitive D-glycerate (K is=4 mM). ratio stromal concentration Mg-ATP phosphoesters, particularly 3-phosphoglycerate, may importance regulation GK C4-photosynthesis.
