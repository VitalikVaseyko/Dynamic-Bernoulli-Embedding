 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) regulates glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation; however, role PKM2 ovarian cancer remains largely unknown. investigated whether ovarian cancer metabolism could provide insight development therapeutic strategies. performed immunohistochemical staining PKM2 tissue microarray multivariate analysis. revealed patients exhibiting higher PKM2 expression significantly associated malignancy groups (p < 0.001) pathogenesis models (p < 0.001), poor progression-free survival rates (p = 0.01) compared patients exhibiting lower PKM2 levels, yielded hazard ratio death 2.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-5.85). cell lines, PKM2 inhibitor significantly inhibited glycolytic rate according cellular glucose consumption (p < 0.001). also utilized Seahorse assays assess metabolism-related cell-specific factors impact PKM2 inhibitors. Energy shifts per Seahorse analysis showed attenuation extracellular acidification rate (p < 0.05) significant difference oxygen-consumption rate SKOV3 cells. Treatment PKM2 inhibitor suppressed ovarian cancer growth cell migration vitro inhibited tumor growth without significant toxicity xenograft study. PKM2 inhibition disturbed Warburg effects inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth. Targeting PKM2 may constitute promising therapy patients ovarian cancer, clinical trials involving shikonin warranted.
