 Targeting specific metabolic phenotypes colorectal cancer stem cells (CRCSCs) innovative therapeutic strategy colorectal cancer (CRC) patients poor prognosis relapse. However, context-dependent metabolic traits CRCSCs remain poorly elucidated. report adenylate kinase hCINAP overexpressed CRC tissues. Depletion hCINAP inhibits invasion, self-renewal, tumorigenesis chemoresistance CRCSCs loss mesenchymal signature. Mechanistically, hCINAP binds C-terminal domain LDHA, key regulator glycolysis, depends adenylate kinase activity promote LDHA phosphorylation tyrosine 10, resulting hyperactive Warburg effect lower cellular ROS level conferring metabolic advantage CRCSC invasion. Moreover, hCINAP expression positively correlated level Y10-phosphorylated LDHA CRC patients. study identifies hCINAP potent modulator metabolic reprogramming CRCSCs promising drug target CRC invasion metastasis.
