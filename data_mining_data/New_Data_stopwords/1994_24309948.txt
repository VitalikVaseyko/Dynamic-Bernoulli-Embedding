 simple, single-tube radiolsotopic method developed assay relative phosphorylation (inaetivation) activity bifunctional regulatory protein (RP) C4-leaf pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) desalted leaf homogenates partially purified preparations. RP catalyzes inactivation maize PPDK phosphorylation Thr-456, utilizing [beta-P]ADP specific phosphoryl donor. Existing spectrophotometric radioisotopic assays detection RP activity either relatively insensitive labor-intensive timeconsuming. describe modified radioisotopic assay couples synthesis [beta-(32)P]ADP exogenous adenylate kinase subsequent RP-catalyzed [beta-(32)P]ADP-dependent phosphorylation exogenous maize PPDK. incorporation [beta-(32)P] dependent initial concentrations ATP PPDK, well presence active RP. Desalted leaf homogenates C3 species fail catalyze (32)P incorporation exogenous maize PPDK. Conversely, heterologous systems containing maize target enzyme leaf homogenats C4 species result PPDK-specific (32)P-incorporation. simple radioisotopic assay least 40-times sensitive routine spectrophotometric assay, qualitatively exhibits comparable sensitivity requires significantly less time currently available radioisotopic RP assay. present assay reliably generates [beta-(32)P]ADP may useful studies systems requiring beta-labeled ADP, commercially available.
