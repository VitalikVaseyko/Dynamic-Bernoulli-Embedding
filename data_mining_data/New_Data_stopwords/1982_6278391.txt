 Pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase isozymic expression investigated 62 childhood cancers electrofocusing immunoneutralization. Isozymic expression roughly intermediate corresponding normal adult fetal tissue. unique features distinguishing malignant adult fetal tissues. addition, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase appeared excellent markers nervous tissue skeletal muscle differentiation. neuroblastomas close relationship differentiation level tumors isozyme composition. phenomenon observed rhabdomyosarcomas teratomas.
