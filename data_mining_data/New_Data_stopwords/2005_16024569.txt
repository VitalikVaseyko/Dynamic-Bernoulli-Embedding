 Thyroid hormone (TH) promotes cardiac mitochondrial maturation substrate metabolism birth. regulation involves ligand-dependent binding nuclear TH receptors target gene elements. TH also putatively controls genes indirectly modulating transcription and/or translation nuclear steroid receptors coactivators, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1). tested hypothesis TH influences PPARalpha PGC-1 regulation metabolic genes postnatal maturation sheep heart vivo. measured mRNAs and/or protein levels downstream targets left ventricle lambs: fetal (F), 30-day-old postnatal thyroidectomy (THY), 30-day-old euthyroid (Con). PPARalpha PGC-1 mRNA expression decreased F Con, PGC-1 protein increased substantially PPARalpha change. THY limited mRNA response attenuated paradoxical postnatal PGC-1 protein elevation alter mRNA levels PPARalpha, nuclear respiratory factor-1 hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. THY promotion PPARalpha mRNA change PPARalpha protein mRNA PPARalpha target genes, pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) muscle type carnitine palmitoyltransferase (mCPTI). THY reduction PGC-1 protein occurred, reducing cytochrome c oxidase cytochrome c content decreasing cardiac maximal inherent respiratory capacity. data imply TH modulates mitochondrial maturation partly posttranscriptional control PGC-1, important regulation PDK4 mCPTI change PPARalpha protein expression remains doubtful. Also, paradoxical expression pattern mRNA protein, particularly PGC-1, suggests feedback control mechanism.
