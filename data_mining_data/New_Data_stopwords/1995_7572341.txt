 Molecular cloning provided evidence new family protein kinases eukaryotic cells. kinases show sequence similarity eukaryotic protein kinases, related sequence histidine protein kinases found prokaryotes. protein kinases, responsible phosphorylation inactivation branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes, located exclusively mitochondrial matrix space likely evolved genes originally present respiration-dependent bacteria endocytosed primitive eukaryotic cells. Long-term regulatory mechanisms involved control activities two kinases considerable interest. Dietary protein deficiency increases activity branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase associated branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. amount branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase protein associated branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex message level branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase greatly increased liver rats starved protein, suggesting increased expression gene encoding branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase. increase branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase activity results greater phosphorylation lower activity branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. metabolic consequence conservation branched chain amino acids protein synthesis periods dietary protein deficiency. Two isoforms pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase identified cloned. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, first isoform cloned, corresponds 48 kDa subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isolated rat heart tissue. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2, second isoform cloned, corresponds 45 kDa subunit enzyme. addition, also appears correspond possibly free soluble form pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase originally named kinase activator protein. Assuming differences kinetic and/or regulatory properties isoforms exist, tissue specific expression enzymes and/or control association complex probably prove important long term regulation activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Starvation diabetic state known greatly increase activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase liver, heart muscle rat. contributes states phosphorylation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex conservation pyruvate lactate gluconeogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
