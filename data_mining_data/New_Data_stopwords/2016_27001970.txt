 Deregulation microRNAs (miRNAs) c-Myc (Myc) contributes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, miRNAs Myc regulate hepatocarcinogenesis still poorly understood. Using functional screen, identified miR-129-5p miRNA inhibits HCC cell growth. miR-129-5p targets mitochondrial matrix protein pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), leads decreased phosphorylation E1alpha subunit pyruvate dehyrogenase (PDH) complex, inhibition glycolysis, retarded tumor growth, impaired lung colonization. Enforced expression PDK4 refractory inhibition miR-129-5p rescued phenotypes. Targeting PDK4 shRNA recapitulated effects caused miR-129-5p. miR-129-5p transcriptionally repressed complex comprised Myc, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), enhancer zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 (EZH2). Levels miR-129-5p negatively correlated clinical stages human HCC. Restoring miR-129-5p expression suppressed diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis mice. Thus, concluded miR-129-5p, negative target Myc, blocks glycolysis retard hepatocarcinogenesis via targeting PDK4. critical link miR-129-5p PDK4 progression HCC suggests potential points therapeutic intervention disease.
