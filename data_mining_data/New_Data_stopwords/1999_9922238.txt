 Lactococcus lactis ptsH ptsI genes, encoding general proteins phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, HPr enzyme I, respectively, cloned, regulatory role HPr studied mutational analysis gene. promoter sequence identified upstream ptsHI operon, transcription start site mapped primer extension. results Northern analyses showed presence two glucose-inducible transcripts, one 0.3 kb containing ptsH second 2.0 kb containing ptsH ptsI. Disruption ptsH ptsI genes strain NZ9800 resulted reduced growth rate expense glucose, growth expense sucrose fructose, confirming dominant role phosphotransferase system uptake sugars L. lactis. Complementation ptsH ptsI mutants intact genes control regulated promoter resulted restoration wild-type phenotype. role HPr(Ser-P) recently established CcpA-mediated control galactose metabolism well glycolysis analyzed producing HPr mutant carrying aspartic acid residue 46 mimicks phosphorylated serine. results experiments demonstrated role HPr(Ser-P) corepressor catabolite repression gal operon. Furthermore, show first time HPr(Ser-P) functions coactivator CcpA-mediated catabolite activation pyruvate kinase L-lactate dehydrogenase genes.
