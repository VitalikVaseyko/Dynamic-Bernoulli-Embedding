 RGS19 regulator G protein signaling upregulated ovarian cancers overexpression promotes cell proliferation several mammalian cell types. showed cyclin D1/3 Cdk6 upregulated HEK293 cells overexpressing RGS19, INK4A INK4B reduced. Moreover, RGS19 augmented serum-stimulated PTEN/PDK/Akt Rb phosphorylations 293/RGS19 Caco2/RGS19 cells. changes reversed upon knockdown RGS19. Consistent elevated Akt activity, increased levels phosphorylated Bad c-Raf diminished expression TSC2 detected, thus demonstrating RGS19 deregulate cell proliferation via multiple pathways.
