 Control C57Bl/10 mutant, dystrophin-deficient mdx mice different ages used study permeability plasma membrane cytosolic components, vital stain (procion orange) extracellular 45calcium. Prenecrotic, 14 +/- 2-day-old mdx mice normal serum activities creatine kinase (CK) pyruvate kinase (PK). Muscles animals also increased permeability procion orange extracellular 45calcium. Serum activities CK PK risen acutely 21-day-old mdx mouse compared control remained elevated 6 months age. influx procion orange 45calcium content abnormally elevated 40 +/- 4-day-old mdx mouse. data provide evidence increase muscle plasma membrane permeability primary pathogenic effect lack dystrophin, results suggest factor expressed de-expressed mouse development may necessary full expression dystrophic process.
