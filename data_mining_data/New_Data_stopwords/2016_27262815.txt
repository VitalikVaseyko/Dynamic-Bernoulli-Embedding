 Paclitaxel commonly used agent breast cancer therapy, comes across obstacle "drug resistance", resulting shortened overall survival patients. Warburg effect become one character cancer cell reported induce paclitaxel resistance, mechanism poorly understood. study, sought examine role 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFKFB3), critical regulator glycolysis, paclitaxel resistance development. Two clones paclitaxel resistant breast cancer cells, MCF-7RA MCF-7RB, established long term exposure MCF-7 cells paclitaxel. Consequently, PFKFB3 expression found increased MCF-7RA MCF-7RB cells compared MCF-7 cells. Silencing PFKFB3 expression markedly reduced IC50 concentrations MCF-7RA MCF-7RB cells. Moreover, PFKFB3 modulated toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) MyD88 expression well interleukin (IL)-6 IL-8 release breast cancer cells response paclitaxel exposure. addition, PFKFB3 overexpression boosted fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) lactate production. enhanced lactate contributed TLR4 signaling activation, IL-6 IL-8 generation, cell viability promotion MCF-7 cells. all, characterized novel role PFKFB3 induction paclitaxel resistance raising lactate production activating TLR4 signaling.
