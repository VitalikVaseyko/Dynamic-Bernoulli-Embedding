 MicroRNAs play critical roles regulating cell survival multiple pathological conditions heart diseases. Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis contributes greatly heart ischemia-reperfusion injury. Herein, describe novel regulatory role miR-28 survival cardiomyocytes. show miR-28 upregulated cardiomyocytes treated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). MiR-28 gain function sensitized cell apoptosis, whereas miR-28 loss function partially rescued cell apoptosis induced H2O2. Importantly, observed significant reduction Akt/mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling activity miR-28 treatment. Luciferase activity assay western blot analysis revealed that, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), critical Akt activation, directly negatively modulated miR-28. results therefore indicate miR-28 regulates oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis heart muscle cells, possibly involves PDK1/Akt/mTOR-dependent mechanism. MIR-28 could serve critical therapeutic target diminish oxidative stress-induced cell death heart.
