 recently examined gene expression Xenopus tadpole tail appendage regeneration found carbohydrate regulatory genes dramatically altered regeneration process. essay, speculate changes gene expression play essential role regeneration stimulating anabolic pathways required reconstruction new appendage. hypothesize regeneration, cells use leptin, slc2a3, proinsulin, g6pd, hif1alpha expression, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, production reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote glucose entry glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), thus stimulating macromolecular biosynthesis. suggest metabolic shift integral appendage regeneration program Xenopus model powerful experimental system explore phenomenon.
