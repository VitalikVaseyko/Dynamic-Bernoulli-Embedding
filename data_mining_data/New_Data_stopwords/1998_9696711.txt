 Although induction cytochrome P-450 1A1 (CYP1A1) Caco-2 clone TC7 alters glucose utilization modifies expression sucrase-isomaltase (SI) hexose transporters, nothing known events control effects. study, analyzed effects beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF) hypoxia parameters expression key enzymes glucose metabolism. beta-NF hypoxia induce similar changes: 1) induction CYP1A1 mRNA; 2) increased glucose consumption lactic acid production lower glycogen content; 3) downregulation SI upregulation GLUT1 mRNAs; 4) downregulation fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase pyruvate kinase mRNAs upregulation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase mRNAs; 5) upregulation c-fos c-jun mRNAs. Although addition inhibitors CYP1A1 catalytic activity beta-NF-treated cells totally inhibits enzyme activity, modify CYP1A1 mRNA response associated effects, thus excluding direct role enzyme per se. results point possible physiological implication signal-transduction pathway responsible CYP1A1 induction.
