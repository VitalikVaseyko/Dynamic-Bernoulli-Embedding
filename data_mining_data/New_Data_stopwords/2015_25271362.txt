 number viral gene products capable inducing apoptosis interfering various cellular signalling cascades. previously reported pro-apoptotic property SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) (membrane)-protein down-regulation phosphorylation level cell-survival protein PKB (protein kinase B)/Akt cells expressing M-protein. also showed overexpression PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1), immediate upstream kinase PKB/Akt, suppressed M-induced apoptosis. illustrates M-protein perturbs PDK1 PKB/Akt cell survival signalling pathway. present study, demonstrated C-terminus M-protein interacts PH (pleckstrin homology) domain PDK1. interaction disrupted association PDK1 PKB/Akt, led down-regulation PKB/Akt activity. subsequently reduced level phosphorylated forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 ASK (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase), led activation caspases 8 9. Altogether, data demonstrate SARS-CoV M-protein induces apoptosis disrupting interaction PDK1 PKB/Akt, causes activation apoptosis. work highlights SARS-CoV protein highly pro-apoptotic capable simultaneously inducing apoptosis via initiating caspases 8 9. Preventing interaction M-protein PDK1 plausible therapeutic approach target pro-apoptotic property SARS-CoV.
