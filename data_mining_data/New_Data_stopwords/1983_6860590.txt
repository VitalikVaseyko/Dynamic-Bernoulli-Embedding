 Pentose phosphate shunt activity studied release 14CO2 14C-1-glucose 14C-2-glucose red cells five patients pyruvate kinase deficiency found significantly decreased new methylene blue stimulation compared high reticulocyte controls. Incubated Heinz body formation increased ascorbate cyanide test positive blood patients. activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) well 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) inhibited 20% baseline normal red cell haemolysate 4 mM 2,3-diphosphoglycerate pH 7.1. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate competitive inhibitor 6-phosphogluconate (Ki=1.05 mM) noncompetitive inhibitor NADP (Ki=3.3 mM) 6PGD. Since intracellular concentrations glucose-6-phosphate, 6-phosphogluconate NADP Kms G6PD 6PGD, kinetic data suggest increased concentrations 2,3-diphosphoglycerate pyruvate kinase deficient red cells sufficiently high suppress pentose phosphate shunt activity. suppression may additional factor contributing haemolytic anaemia pyruvate kinase deficiency, particularly periods infection metabolic stress.
