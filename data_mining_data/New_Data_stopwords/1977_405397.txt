 Parenchymal cells isolated adult rat liver enzyme perfusion technique. single-cell suspension, representing 40-50% liver's hepatocytes suspended medium maintained primary culture four days. cells found carry glycogen synthesis first eight hours culture time accumulated glycogen gradually degraded. ability liver cell cultures accumulate glycogen found dependent upon metabolic state animal prior cell isolation. Cells prepared feeding period animals 8+16 feeding schedule markedly different capacities glycogen accumulation. Changes glycogen metabolism found due, part, changes fraction cells involved metabolism given time. High concentrations glucose stimulated cells deposit glycogen response reduced longer cells culture 3-day period. loss glycogen synthesizing capacity appears due decrease glycogen synthetase activity. activities pyruvate kinase, hexokinase aldolase also decrease culture period.
