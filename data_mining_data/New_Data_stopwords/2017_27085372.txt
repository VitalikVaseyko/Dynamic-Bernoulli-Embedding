 Hypoxia tolerance plastic trait, vary species. compared hypoxia tolerance (hypoxic loss equilibrium, LOE, critical O2 tension, Pcrit) traits dictate O2 transport metabolism pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), bluegill (L. macrochirus), naturally occurring hybrid different acclimation environments (wild versus lab-acclimated fish) different temperatures. Wild fish generally lower Pcrit lower PO2 LOE progressive hypoxia lab-acclimated fish, time LOE sustained hypoxia (PO2 2kPa) vary environments. Wild fish also greater gill surface area higher haematocrit, suggesting increased O2 transport capacity underlies environmental variation Pcrit. Metabolic (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; pyruvate kinase, PK; citrate synthase; cytochrome c oxidase) antioxidant (catalase superoxide dismutase) enzyme activities varied appreciably environments. Wild fish higher protein contents across tissues higher activities LDH heart, PK brain, catalase brain, liver, skeletal muscle. Otherwise, wild fish lower activities enzymes. Warming temperature 15 25 degrees C increased O2 consumption rate, Pcrit, PO2 LOE, haemoglobin-O2 affinity, decreased time LOE, pumpkinseed >/=2-fold longer time LOE bluegill hybrids across temperature range. associated higher LDH activities heart muscle, lower similar antioxidant enzyme activities several tissues. However, greater hypoxia tolerance pumpkinseed collapsed 28 degrees C, demonstrating interactive effects hypoxia warming temperature differ species. Overall, distinct mechanisms appear underpin interspecific environment-induced variation hypoxia tolerance sunfish.
