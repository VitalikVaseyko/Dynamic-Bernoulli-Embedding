 base sequences nucleic acids corresponding ten proteins (aconitase, alcohol dehydrogenase, enolase, fumarase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase succinate dehydrogenase) belonging total 154 species, ranging prokaryotes vertebrates, compared base sequences oligoribotides whose growth rates calculated chemical kinetics model. shown oligoribotides grown according kinetics model fraction repetitive bases larger expected random processes. base sequences nucleic acids prokaryotes eukaryotes retain, decreasing proportions, feature abiotic past. Chemically synthesized pentameric stretches repetitive bases slightly abundant present prokaryotes. Genetic drift natural selection, operating fundamental laws even primitive living systems, reduced original, chemically controlled, repetitive base frequency prokaryotes, reduced eukaryotes.
