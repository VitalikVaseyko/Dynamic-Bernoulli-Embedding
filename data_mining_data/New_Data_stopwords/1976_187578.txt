 conformational transitions polypeptide chain elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) associated ligand change GDP GTP also displacement GDP elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) investigated using spin-labeling technique. two reactive sulfhydryl groups EF-Tu, one essential interaction aminoacyl-tRNA selectively labeled various kinds iodoacetamide maleimide spin-labeling reagents. electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra EF-Tu-GDP labeled reagents generally consisted two components, one narrow one broad, corresponding labels relatively weakly strongly immobilized, respectively. degree immobilization ratio narrow broad components different kind label used. spectra spin-labeled EF-Tu-GDP changed markedly GDP moiety replaced GTP incubation phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40], broad component increasing expense narrow component. reversible nature conformational change confirmed EF-Tu labeled maleimide reagent. GTP-induced spectral change reversed upon conversion labeled EF-Tu-GTP EF-Tu-GDP addition excess GDP. similar type spectral change also observed spin-labeled EF-Tu-GDP incubated EF-Ts form labeled EF-Tu-EF-Ts complex. extent spectral change induced EF-Ts even greater induced GTP. results, together obtained studies hydrophobic fluorescent probes (Arai, Arai, Kawakita, & Kaziro (1975) J. Biochem. 77, 1095-1106) indicate reversible conformational change induced EF-Tu near sulfhydryl group essential interaction aminoacyl-tRNA.
