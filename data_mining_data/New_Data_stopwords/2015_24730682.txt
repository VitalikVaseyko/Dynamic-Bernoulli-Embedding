 CONTEXT: Acute inhalation combustion smoke adversely affects brain homeostasis energy metabolism. previously showed overexpressed neuroglobin (Ngb), neuron specific globin protein, attenuates formation smoke inhalation-induced oxidative DNA damage, vivo, mouse brain, others reported protection Ngb diverse models brain injury, mainly involving oxidative stress hypoxic/ischemic insults. OBJECTIVE: determine extent elevated Ngb ameliorates post smoke-inhalation brain bioenergetics homeostasis Ngb overexpressing transgenic mouse. METHODS: Smoke inhalation induced changes bioenergetics measured wild type Ngb transgene mouse brain. Modulations mitochondrial respiration analyzed using Seahorse XF24 flux analyzer changes cytoplasmic energy metabolism assessed measuring enzymatic activities lactate course post smoke recovery. RESULTS: Cortical mitochondria Ngb transgene, better maintained ATP synthesis-linked oxygen consumption unlike wild type mitochondria increase futile oxygen consumption feeding proton leak, reflecting lesser smoke-induced mitochondrial compromise. Measurements revealed lesser reduction mitochondrial ATP content lesser compensatory increases cytosolic energy metabolism, involving pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activities well cytosolic lactate levels. Additionally, induction c-Fos, early response gene key neuronal stress sensor, attenuated Ngb transgene compared wild type brain smoke. CONCLUSION: Considered together, differences reflect lesser perturbations produced acute inhalation combustion smoke Ngb overexpressing mouse, suggesting Ngb mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction neurotoxicity raises threshold smoke inhalation-induced brain injury.
