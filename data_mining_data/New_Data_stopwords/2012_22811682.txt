 mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC) regulated reversible seryl-phosphorylation E1alpha subunit dedicated, intrinsic kinase. phospho-complex reactivated dephosphorylated intrinsic PP2C-type protein phosphatase. position phosphorylated Ser-residue sequences flanking amino acids highly conserved. used synthetic peptide-based kinase client (KiC) assay plus recombinant pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha E1alpha-kinase perform "scanning mutagenesis" residues flanking site phosphorylation. Consistent results "phylogenetic analysis" flanking sequences, direct peptide-based kinase assays tolerated changes. Even conservative changes Leu, Ile, Val Met, Glu Asp, gave marked reductions phosphorylation. Overall results indicate regulation mtPDC reversible phosphorylation extreme example multiple, interdependent instances co-evolution.
