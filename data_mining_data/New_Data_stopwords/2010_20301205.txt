 1930, Otto Warburg observed cancer cells produce increased amount energy aerobic glycolysis subsequently, called Warburg effect. aging, capacity mitochondrial respiration clearly declines aerobic glycolysis appears compensate deficiency oxidative metabolism. shift energy production, aging cancer, could protect toxic effects oxygen free radicals whereas increased glycolysis adverse effects. recently demonstrated glycolysis-linked protein O-glycosylation potentiate catalytic activity IKK beta subsequently trigger NF-kappaB signaling. seems tumor suppressor oncogene p53 important role regulation protein O-glycosylation since p53 potent inhibitor glycolysis, example, via TIGAR protein expression. Aging known repress function p53 could enhance glycolysis NF-kappaB signaling. discuss role p53 regulation glycolysis-dependent activation NF-kappaB signaling cancer aging process.
