 Protection thermal denaturation, urea denaturation tryptic inactivation rat liver glucokinase (ATP:D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2979192) provided glucose lesser degree sorbitol. 2. Protection glucose exhibits two distinct stages, one occurring physiological substrate levels, occurring well necessary enzyme saturation. Sorbitol protection increases uniformly increasing sorbitol concentration. 3. Several enzymes also protected heat inactivation high concentrations glucose sorbitol.
