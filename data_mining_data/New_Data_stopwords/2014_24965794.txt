 Current evidence indicates mammalian target rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin increases longevity and, seemingly contradictorily, impairs glucose homeostasis. studies exploring dimensions paradox based rapamycin treatment mice 20 wk. sought better understand metabolic effects oral rapamycin substantially longer period time HET3 mice. observed treatment rapamycin 52 wk induced diabetes male mice, characterized hyperglycemia, significant urine glucose levels, severe glucose pyruvate intolerance. Glucose intolerance occurred male mice 4 wk rapamycin could partially reversed cessation rapamycin treatment. Female mice developed moderate glucose intolerance 1 yr rapamycin treatment, diabetes. role sex hormones differential development diabetic symptoms male female mice explored. HET3 mice treated rapamycin 52 wk gonadectomized monitored 10 wk. Castrated male mice remained glucose intolerant, ovariectomized females developed significant glucose intolerance time period. Subsequent replacement 17beta-estradiol (E2) ovariectomized females promoted recovery glucose tolerance 4-wk period, suggesting protective role E2 rapamycin-induced diabetes. results indicate 1) oral rapamycin treatment causes diabetes male mice, 2) diabetes partially reversible cessation treatment, 3) E2 plays protective role development rapamycin-induced diabetes.
