 study describe growth several different larval cohorts (i.e. half-siblings mother born day) rare, xeric-adapted salamander Salamandra s. infraimmaculata Martens, 1885, constant density food conditions birth metamorphosis. larvae spend critical first phase lives water, mostly temporary ponds. Age weight metamorphosis highly affected varying food conditions. identified six different growth modes larvae use, fast growing slow growing. larval cohort found use 2-4 different growth modes regardless initial weight. Fast growing modes (I-III) enable larvae survive dry years, metamorphose bigger. Slow growing modes (IV-VI), used 8% larval population, enable survival rainy years. last growth modes effect differential temporal dispersal wet years delaying emergence postmetamorphs onto land. Distribution growth modes larval population affected food density conditions. Late-born, fast-growing larvae advantage dry years able metamorphose disperse, whereas slow-growing larvae survive wet years.
