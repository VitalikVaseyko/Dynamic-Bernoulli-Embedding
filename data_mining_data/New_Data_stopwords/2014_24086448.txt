 IL-6 plays diverse roles normal disease-associated immunity associated Graves' disease (GD). syndrome, orbit undergoes remodeling process known thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). Recently, CD34(+) fibrocytes found infiltrate orbit TAO transition CD34(+) orbital fibroblasts. Surprisingly, fibrocytes display high levels functional thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), central antigen GD. report TSH pathogenic anti-TSHR antibodies drive hyperthyroidism GD induce IL-6 expression fibrocytes orbital fibroblasts. Unlike TSHR signaling thyroid epithelium, occurring fibrocytes completely independent adenylate cyclase activation cAMP generation. Instead TSH activates PDK1 AKT/PKB PKC pathways. Expression use PKCbetaII switches PKCmicro fibrocytes transition TAO orbital fibroblasts. shift imposed CD34(-) orbital fibroblasts reverts CD34(+) fibroblasts isolated. up-regulation IL-6 TSH results coordinately enhanced IL-6 gene promoter activity increased IL-6 mRNA stability. TSH-dependent IL-6 expression requires activity CREB (-213 -208 nt) NF-kappaB (-78 -62 nt) binding sites. results provide novel insights molecular action TSH signaling downstream TSHR non-thyroid cells. Fibrocytes neither express adenylate cyclase generate cAMP thus findings free influence cAMP-related signaling. identify potential therapeutic targets TAO.
