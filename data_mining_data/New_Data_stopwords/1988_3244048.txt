 assay method pyruvate kinase rat plasma described. Plasma samples incubated ADP phosphoenolpyruvate Tris buffer solution. ATP produced pyruvate kinase measured photocounting addition commercially available luciferin-luciferase preparation. Interference ATP adenylate kinase originally present sample removed high degree dilution. assay sensitive, reproducible, rapid, especially used large numbers samples. method, pyruvate kinase activity normal rats determined 0.51 +/- 0.05 (n = 6) U/ml plasma. rats fed vitamin E-deficient basal diet 7, 10, 14 weeks, pyruvate kinase activities 0.70 +/- 0.11, 1.64 +/- 0.51, 4.28 +/- 0.85 (n = 6) U/ml plasma, respectively. method appears useful determination pyruvate kinase activity nutritional pharmacological studies.
