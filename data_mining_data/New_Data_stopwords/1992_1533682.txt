 investigate alveolar macrophages adapt oxidative pollutants long term, rats exposed strong oxidant, ozone (O3), weak oxidant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), maximum duration 12 wk. exposures, alveolar macrophages collected pulmonary lavage. Throughout 11 wk exposure 0.2 ppm O3, specific activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) glutathione peroxidase peroxidative metabolic pathway pyruvate kinase hexokinase glycolytic pathway 40-70% elevated controls alveolar macrophages. population alveolar macrophages consistently 60% higher controls. small-sized macrophages, immature macrophages, preferentially increased. contrary, thymidine incorporation per cell always 20-30% lower controls, although total incorporation remained unchanged. infiltration polymorphonuclear leukocytes occurred. 12 wk exposures 1.2 4.0 ppm NO2, population alveolar macrophages increased 30% control. Among enzymes examined, however, G6PDH activity increased 10% 4.0 ppm NO2. increase enzyme activities occurred 1.2 ppm NO2. Based results, alveolar macrophages adapt long-term exposure O3 NO2 recruiting immature macrophages apparent influx monocytes. exposure O3, peroxidative metabolic glycolytic pathways enhanced persistently alveolar macrophages, whereas pathways enhanced exposures NO2.
