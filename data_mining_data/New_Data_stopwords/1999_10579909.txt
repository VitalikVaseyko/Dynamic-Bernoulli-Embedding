 family Raf-protein kinases consisting A-Raf, B-Raf, c-Raf-1 involved cellular processes regulate proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis. Cell-culture experiments knockout individual Raf genes suggested three Raf isoforms overlapping unique regulatory functions. However, known isotype-specific functions Raf kinases occur cell. Published data suggest Raf proteins might differ regulation activation well ability connect downstream signaling pathways. Since Raf part multiprotein complex protein-protein interactions important Raf signaling, propose isotype-specific functions achieved isotype-restricted protein binding. Recently able identify candidates Raf-isoform-specific interaction partners.
