 1. regulatory properties two interconvertible kinetic forms class pyruvate kinase Ehrlich ascites tumor cells studied partially purified enzyme preparation free interfering enzymatic activities. 2. hyperbolic form shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics P-pyruvate, high affinity substrate low affinity inhibitory amino acids alanine phenylalanine. sigmoidal form displays positive cooperativity respect P-pyruvate (n=1.4), lower affinity substrate higher affinity inhibitory amino acids. 3. equilibrium hyperbolic sigmoidal forms enzyme affected substraetes effectors. P-pyruvate, ADP Fru-P2 shift equilibrium hyperbolic form ATP, alanine phenylalanine stabilize sigmoidal form. 4. Effector metabolites affect molecular weight protein, acting equilibrium dimers tetramers. P-pyruvate ADP associate enzyme tetramer ATP, alanine phenylalanine favor occurrence dimer. positive modifier Fru-P2 associate enzyme tetramer, even 1 mM concentration. 5. tentative molecular model pyruvate kinase basis kinetic aggregation interconversion proposed.
