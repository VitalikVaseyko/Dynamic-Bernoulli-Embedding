 Amino acids considered regulators metabolism several species, increasing importance accorded role amino acids signalling molecules regulating protein synthesis activation TOR transduction pathway. Using rainbow trout hepatocytes, examined ability amino acids regulate hepatic metabolism-related gene expression either alone together insulin, possible involvement TOR. demonstrated amino acids alone regulate expression several genes, including glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, 6-phospho-fructo-1-kinase serine dehydratase, unknown molecular pathway independent TOR activation. insulin amino acids added together, different pattern regulation observed depended upon activation TOR pathway. pattern included dramatic up-regulation lipogenic (fatty acid synthase, ATP-citrate lyase sterol responsive element binding protein 1) glycolytic (glucokinase, 6-phospho-fructo-1-kinase pyruvate kinase) genes TOR-dependent manner. Regarding gluconeogenesis genes, glucose-6-phosphatase inhibited TOR-dependent manner combination insulin amino acids amino acids alone. study first demonstrate important role amino acids combination insulin molecular regulation hepatic metabolism.
