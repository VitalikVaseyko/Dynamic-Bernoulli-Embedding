 Nup153 large O-linked glycoprotein component basket-like structure forms nucleoplasmic face nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Nup153 molecule tripartite structure consisting N- C-terminal domains flanking central zinc finger domain. targeting assembly information contained within Nup153 contributed N-domain. fact region molecule target cytosolic protein, pyruvate kinase, nucleoplasmic face NPC. zinc finger C-terminal domains appear role targeting assembly activities. Deletion analysis reveals two distinct regions within Nup153 N-domain contain different targeting functions. One directly involved assembly NPC second overlapping region may target Nup153, well reporter molecules, inner face nuclear envelope.
