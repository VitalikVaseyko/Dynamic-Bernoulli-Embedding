 Aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) core hallmark cancer, molecular mechanisms underlying remain unclear. Here, identify unexpected central role mTORC2 cancer metabolic reprogramming controls glycolytic metabolism ultimately regulating cellular level c-Myc. show mTORC2 promotes inactivating phosphorylation class IIa histone deacetylases, leads acetylation FoxO1 FoxO3, turn releases c-Myc suppressive miR-34c-dependent network. central features activated mTORC2 signaling, acetylated FoxO, c-Myc levels highly intercorrelated clinical samples shorter survival GBM patients. results identify specific, Akt-independent role mTORC2 regulating glycolytic metabolism cancer.
