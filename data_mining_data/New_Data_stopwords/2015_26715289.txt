 Novel approaches cancer chemotherapy employ metabolic differences normal tumor cells, including high dependence cancer cells glycolysis ("Warburg effect"). 3-Bromopyruvate (3-BP), inhibitor glycolysis, belongs anticancer drugs basing principle. 3-BP tested capacity kill human non-invasive MCF-7 invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. found 3-BP toxic MDA-MB-231 cells MCF-7 cells. cell lines, statistically significant decrease ATP glutathione observed time- 3-BP concentration-dependent manner. Transient increases level reactive oxygen species reactive oxygen species observed, pronounced MCF-7 cells, followed decreasing tendency. Activities glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase (GR) glutathione S-transferase (GST) decreased 3-BP treated MDA-MB-231 cells. MCF-7 cells decreases GR GST activities noted highest concentration 3-BP.These results point induction oxidative stress 3-BP via depletion antioxidants inactivation antioxidant enzymes, pronounced MDA-MB-231 cells, sensitive 3-BP.
