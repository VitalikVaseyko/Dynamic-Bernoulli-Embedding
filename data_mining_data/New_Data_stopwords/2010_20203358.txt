 titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2) NPs) widely used commercially, potential toxicity human health attracted particular attention. present study, oral toxicological effects TiO(2) NPs (dosed 0.16, 0.4 1 g kg( - 1), respectively) investigated using conventional approaches metabonomic analysis Wistar rats. Serum chemistry, hematology histopathology examinations performed. urine serum investigated (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) using principal components partial least squares discriminant analysis. metabolic signature urinalysis TiO(2) NP-treated rats showed increases levels taurine, citrate, hippurate, histidine, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), citrulline, alpha-ketoglutarate, phenylacetylglycine (PAG) acetate; moreover, decreases levels lactate, betaine, methionine, threonine, pyruvate, 3-D-hydroxybutyrate (3-D-HB), choline leucine observed. metabonomics analysis serum showed increases TMAO, choline, creatine, phosphocholine 3-D-HB well decreases glutamine, pyruvate, glutamate, acetoacetate, glutathione methionine TiO(2) NP treatment. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevated mitochondrial swelling heart tissue observed TiO(2) NP-treated rats. findings indicate disturbances energy amino acid metabolism gut microflora environment may attributable slight injury liver heart caused TiO(2) NPs. Moreover, NMR-based metabolomic approach reliable sensitive method study biochemical effects nanomaterials.
