 adaptive response renal metabolism glucose studied isolated rat proximal distal renal tubules high protein-low carbohydrate diet administration. nutritional situation significantly stimulated gluconeogenic activity renal proximal tubules (about 1.5 fold 48 hours) due, part, marked increase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities. tubular fragment, FBPase activity increased subsaturating fructose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration (30% 48 hours) involved significant decrease Km (31%) substrate without changes Vmax. enzymatic behaviour probably related modifications activity enzyme already present renal cells. Proximal PEPCK activity progressively increased substrate concentrations (almost 2 fold 48h high protein diet) brought changes Vmax without changes Kim. changes agreement variations cellular concentration enzyme. Neither gluconeogenesis gluconeogenic enzymes changed distal fractions renal tubules. hand, high protein diet apparently modify glycolytic ability fragment nephron, although significant increase phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activities found distal renal tubules. short term regulation involved significant decrease 24 hours Km value distal PFK (almost 40%) without changes Vmax. kinetic behaviour distal PK mixed. first 24h high protein diet significant decrease Km phosphoenolpyruvate found (30%) without variation Vmax, however second 24 hours activity glycolytic enzyme increased significantly (almost 1.3 fold) without modifications Km value. contrary, nutritional state modify kinetic behaviour glycolytic enzyme proximal regions renal tubules.
