 Serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, calcium (Ca) magnesium (Mg) contents skeletal muscle isolated mitochondria, well oxidative phosphorylation X-linked muscular dystrophic (mdx) mice compared normal control animals ages 5, 10, 23 weeks. Serum CK elevated mdx mice ages, highest activities 5 weeks. Ca content dystrophic skeletal muscle increased ages, whereas clearly abnormal trend muscle Mg levels observed. Noncollagen protein (NCP), used reference base, significantly diminished muscle 10- 23-week-old mdx animals. Isolated mitochondria mdx mice elevated calcium content decreased respiratory control ratios NAD-linked substrates pyruvate/malate. findings distinct dystrophic mice, strain 129/ReJ, similar observations dystrophic hamsters Duchenne muscular dystrophy reflect occurrence overt muscle cell necrosis.
