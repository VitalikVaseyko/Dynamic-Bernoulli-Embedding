 Aerobic glycolysis seemingly wasteful mode ATP production seen rapidly proliferating mammalian cells highly active contracting muscles, whether common origin presence widely different systems unknown. study issue, develop model human central metabolism incorporates solvent capacity constraint metabolic enzymes mitochondria, accounting occupied volume densities, assuming glucose and/or fatty acid utilization. model demonstrates activation aerobic glycolysis favored threshold metabolic rate rapidly proliferating cells heavily contracting muscles, provides higher ATP yield per volume density mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. case muscle physiology, model also predicts lactate switch, fatty acid oxidation increases, reaches maximum, decreases zero concomitant increase glucose utilization, agreement empirical evidence. results corroborated larger scale model, including biosynthesis major cell biomass components. larger scale model also predicts proliferating cells lactate switch accompanied activation glutaminolysis, another distinctive feature Warburg effect. conclusion, intracellular molecular crowding fundamental constraint cell metabolism rapidly proliferating- non-proliferating cells high metabolic demand. Addition constraint metabolic flux balance models explain several observations mammalian cell metabolism steady state conditions.
