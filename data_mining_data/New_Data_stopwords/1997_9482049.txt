 presumptive coronal sutures rat fetuses gestation days 19 20 shown fuse prematurely grown absence dura mater culture. present study, representative enzymes glucose metabolism antioxidative pathway assayed process suture fusion. coronal sutures fetal day 19.5 (F19) neonatal day 1 rats grown presence absence dura mater serum-free culture. enzymes assayed hexokinase (HK) pyruvate kinase (PK) glycolysis, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) glutathione reductase (GR) antioxidative pathway. F19 sutures cultured without dura mater, fused, showed significant increases enzyme activities preculture levels. HK increased 200% 300% preculture levels, G6PD 400% 500%, GR 200%, PK 400% 500%. fetal sutures cultured dura mater, fuse, showed little alterations HK, G6PD, GR activities, showed significant 200% 400% increase PK activity. Neonatal sutures showed significant increases enzyme activities culture, presence dura mater significantly affect enzyme activities. High activity levels enzymes antioxidative pathway F19 sutures coincided period premature suture fusion. Treatment fetal calvaria prooxidant (induced ferrous iron ascorbic acid) produced suture fusion even presence dura mater. Treatment deferoxamine (an iron chelator antioxidant) culture prevented suture fusion. results suggest fusing sutures experience increased biosynthetic demands placed oxidative stress. oxidative stress overwhelms dural influence, sutures undergo premature fusion.
