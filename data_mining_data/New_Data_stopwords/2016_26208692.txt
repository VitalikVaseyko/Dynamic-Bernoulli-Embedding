 Aspergillus terreus reported promising fungal strain itaconic acid; however, commercial production suffers low yield. Low production yield claimed result completing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle towards biomass synthesis limiting phosphate nitrogen; TCA cycle somewhat shunted consequently, metabolite fluxes move towards itaconic acid production route. regulating enzymes TCA cycle, believed itaconic acid production improved. One key responsible enzymes involved itaconic acid production triggered study. Pyruvate carboxylase allosterically inhibited L-aspartate. presence 10 mM L-aspartate production medium directly repressed PC expression living A. terreus limited malate flux regulated malate/citrate antiporters resulting increasing cis-aconitate decarboxylase activity simultaneously convert cis-aconitate, citrate isomer, itaconic acid. transport cis-aconitate via antiporters induced citrate synthase 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activities response balance fluxes TCA intermediates. Successively, itaconic acid production yield final concentration could improved 8.33 60.32 %, respectively, compared obtained control fermentation shortened lag time produce itaconic acid production phase.
