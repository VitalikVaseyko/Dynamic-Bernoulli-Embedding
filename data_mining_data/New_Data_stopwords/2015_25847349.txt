 Dysmorphic neurons balloon cells constitute neuropathological hallmarks type II focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) refractory epilepsy. genesis cells may critical histological findings type II FCD. Recent work shown enhanced activation mTOR cascade balloon cells dysmorphic neurons, suggesting common pathogenesis two neuropathological hallmarks. direct comparative analysis balloon cells dysmorphic neurons might identify molecular link balloon cells dysmorphic neurons. Here, addressed whether PDK1-AKT-mTOR activation differentiates balloon cells dysmorphic neurons. used immunohistochemistry antibodies phosphorylated (p)-PDK1 (Ser241), p-AKT (Thr308), p-AKT (Ser473), p-mTOR (Ser2448), p-P70S6K (Thr229), p-p70S6 kinase (Thr389) balloon cells compared dysmorphic neurons. Strong moderate staining components PDK1-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway observed balloon cells dysmorphic neurons. However, pyramidal neurons displayed weak staining control group (perilesional neocortex histologically normal neocortex). Additionally, p-PDK1 (Ser241) p-AKT (Thr308) staining balloon cells stronger dysmorphic neurons, whereas p-P70S6K (Thr229) p-p70S6 kinase (Thr389) staining balloon cells weaker dysmorphic neurons. balloon cells, p-AKT (Ser473) p-mTOR (Ser2448) staining comparable staining dysmorphic neurons. data support previously suggested pathogenic relationship balloon cells dysmorphic neurons concerning activation PDK1-AKT-mTOR, may play important roles pathogenesis type II FCD. Differential expression components PDK1-AKT-mTOR pathway balloon cells dysmorphic neurons may result cell-specific gene expression.
