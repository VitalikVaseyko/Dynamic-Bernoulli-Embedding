 Isoelectric focusing MCF-7 cell extracts revealed association glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase. complex glycolytic enzymes sensitive RNase. p36 could detected within association glycolytic enzymes; however association p36 specific form malate dehydrogenase found. MCF-7 cells three forms malate dehydrogenase detected isoelectric focusing: mitochondrial form isoelectric point 8.9 9.5, cytosolic form pl 5.0, p36-associated form pl 7.8. mitochondrial form comprises mature mitochondrial isoenzyme (pl 9.5) precursor form (pl 8.9). Refocusing pl 7.8 form malate dehydrogenase also gave rise mitochondrial isoenzyme. Thus, pl 7.8 form malate dehydrogenase actually mitochondrial isoenzyme retained cytosol association p36. Addition fructose 1,6-bisphosphate initial focusing column induced quantitative shift pl 7.8 form malate dehydrogenase mitochondrial forms (pl 8.9 9.5). MCF-7 cells p36 phosphorylated tyrosine. Kinetic measurements revealed pl 7.8 form malate dehydrogenase lowest affinity NADH. Compared mitochondrial forms cytosolic isoenzyme high capacity measured NAD --> NADH direction (malate --> oxaloacetate direction). association p36 mitochondrial isoenzyme may favor flow hydrogen cytosol mitochondria. Inhibition cell proliferation AMP leads inhibition glycolysis effect complex formation glycolytic glutaminolytic enzymes MCF-7 cells. AMP treatment leads activation malate dehydrogenase, correlates increase pyruvate decrease lactate levels, effect distribution various malate dehydrogenase forms.
