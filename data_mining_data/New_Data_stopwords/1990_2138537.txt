 investigated topography glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol implicated insulin action combination two complementary methods: (a) chemical labelling non-permeable (isethionyl acetimidate) permeable (ethyl acetimidate) probe; (b) enzymatic modifications beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3). Using first approach majority glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol found outer surface intact hepatocytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts lymphocytes, erythrocytes presented 20% total labelled glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol exterior. Upon insulin addition (10 nM), 60% total glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol hydrolysed hepatocytes adipocytes erythrocytes. agreement extracellular localization hepatocytes proposed role glycolipid insulin action, treatment rat hepatocytes beta-galactosidase Escherichia coli, enzyme hydrolyses oligosaccharide moiety glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol, cleaved 65% total glycophospholipid blocked effect insulin (but glucagon) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). Similar treatment phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C Bacillus cereus hydrolysed 62% total glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol. various approaches used concluded majority glycophospholipid outer surface variety insulin-sensitive cells.
