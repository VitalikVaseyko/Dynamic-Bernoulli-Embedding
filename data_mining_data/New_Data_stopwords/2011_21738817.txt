 Due enormous advances quantitative proteomics immunohistochemistry (pathology), two research areas reached state successfully interwoven order tackle challenges toponostics open tumor-targeted systems pathology approaches. study differential expressions candidate proteins nucleophosmin, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A/B (NDKA/B), osteoinducive factor (mimecan), pyru-vate kinase M2 quantitative proteome signature invasive ductal breast cancer determined immunohistochemistry 53 tissue slices formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor control tissue samples ten patients fourteen controls. addition, 87 images Human Protein Atlas representing seven tumor nine normal breast tissue samples investigated computer-assisted semi-quantitative density measurements nucleophosmin, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A/B (NDKA/B), osteoinducive factor (mimecan), pyruvate kinase M2, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-genase (GAP-DH), mimecan (osteoinductive factor). IHC data sets match well support quantitative proteome analysis data. Determining spatial distribution signature protein expressions protein imaging morphologically intact tissue samples sub-cellular level and, hence, keeping topological information, presents added value quantitative proteome data. comprehensive data sets needed both, pathway analyses "next generation clinical diagnostics" approaches.
