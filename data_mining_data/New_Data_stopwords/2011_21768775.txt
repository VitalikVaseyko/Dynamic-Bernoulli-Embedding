 Previously, identified form epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling, cancer cells induce aerobic glycolysis adjacent stromal fibroblasts, via oxidative stress, driving autophagy mitophagy. turn, cancer-associated fibroblasts provide recycled nutrients epithelial cancer cells, "fueling" oxidative mitochondrial metabolism anabolic growth. additional consequence glycolytic fibroblasts protect cancer cells apoptosis, providing steady nutrient stream mitochondria cancer cells. Here, investigated whether interactions might basis tamoxifen-resistance ER(+) breast cancer cells. show MCF7 cells alone Tamoxifen-sensitive, become resistant co-cultured hTERT-immortalized human fibroblasts. Next, searched drug combination (Tamoxifen + Dasatinib) could over-come fibroblast-induced Tamoxifen-resistance. Importantly, show drug combination acutely induces Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) MCF7 cancer cells, abruptly cutting ability use fuel supply, effectively killing cancer cells. Thus, believe Warburg effect tumor cells "root cause" cancer, rather may provide necessary clues preventing chemo-resistance cancer cells. Finally, observed drug combination (Tamoxifen + Dasatinib) also generalized anti-oxidant effect, co-cultured fibroblasts cancer cells alike, potentially reducing tumor-stroma co-evolution. results consistent idea chemo-resistance may metabolic stromal phenomenon overcome targeting mitochondrial function epithelial cancer cells. Thus, simultaneously targeting (1) tumor stroma (2) epithelial cancer cells, combination therapies, may successful approach anti-cancer therapy. general strategy combination therapy overcoming drug resistance could applicable many different types cancer.
