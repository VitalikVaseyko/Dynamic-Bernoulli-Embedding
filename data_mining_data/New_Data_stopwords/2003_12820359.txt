 INTRODUCTION: Tumor M2-PK isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. isoform exists active tetrameric less active dimeric form. dimeric form expressed various tumor cells measured blood specific ELISA. MATERIALS METHODS: included 500 healthy persons, 20 patients acute rheumatic disease (high CRP) 30 patients nephropathy proteinuria 20 mg/dl. measured Tumor M2-PK groups different specimens EDTA-plasma, serum, heparin-, citrate-, fluoride- oxalate-plasma. RESULTS: found different concentrations Tumor M2-PK healthy persons depending kind specimen. normal range Tumor M2-PK concentration higher serum plasma, 35 U/l compared 15 U/l. haemolytic material found concentrations 80 U/l healthy persons. Lipaemic icteric serum material showed higher concentration Tumor M2-PK well. patients triglyceride concentration higher 300 mg/dl, normal range Tumor M2-PK measured 30-50 U/l. Similar results found patients icteric serum. Patients active rheumatic disease elevated CRP concentration showed Tumor M2-PK concentration 40-60 U/l. Patients nephropathy proteinuria 20 mg/dl elevated Tumor M2-PK concentration 25-60 U/l. CONCLUSION: conclude different materials seem suitable measurement Tumor M2-PK concentration long attention paid different normal ranges. Haemolytic material used offers false-positive results. diseases rheumatic disease, hyperlipidaemia nephropathy influence Tumor M2-PK concentration neglected.
