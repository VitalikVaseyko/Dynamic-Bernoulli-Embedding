 identified novel human cDNA encoding mitochondrial protein, MTP18 (mitochondrial protein, 18 kDa) transcriptional downstream target phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling. demonstrate MTP18 mRNA well protein expression dependent PI 3-kinase activity. Confocal microscopy biochemical fractionation revealed mitochondrial localization MTP18. Loss-of-function analysis employing antisense molecules revealed MTP18 essential cell viability PC-3 HaCaT cells. show knockdown MTP18 protein level results cytochrome c release mitochondria consequently leads apoptosis. addition, HaCaT cells reduced levels MTP18 become sensitive apoptotic stimuli. effect accompanied dramatic subcellular alterations. Reduction MTP18 impairs mitochondrial morphology resulting formation highly interconnected mitochondrial reticulum COS-7 cells. Conversely, overexpression MTP18 induces punctuate morphology mitochondria suggesting also functional role MTP18 maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Hence, data indicate unexpected connection PI 3-kinase signaling, apoptosis morphology mammalian mitochondria.
