 Dysregulation lipid metabolism common cancer cells, underlying mechanisms poorly understood. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) stimulate lipid biosynthesis transcriptional activation lipogenic enzymes. However, SREBPs' roles potential interacting partners cancer cells fully defined. Using biochemical approach, found pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) physically interacts nuclear form SREBP-1a (nBP1a), binding amino acids 43-56 nBP1a. also found PKM2 activates SREBP target gene expression lipid biosynthesis stabilizing nBP1a proteins. Using competitive peptide inhibitor block formation SREBP-1a/PKM2 complex, observed blockade inhibited lipogenic gene expression. note, nBP1a phosphorylation Thr-59 enhanced binding PKM2 promoted cancer cell growth. Moreover, show PKM2 phosphorylates Thr-59 vitro. Lastly, human patients hepatocellular carcinoma, nBP1a phosphorylation Thr-59 negatively correlated clinical outcomes. Together, results reveal nBP1a/PKM2 interaction activates lipid metabolism genes cancer cells Thr-59 phosphorylation SREBP-1a plays important role cancer cell proliferation.
