 Fisetin (3, 7, 3', 4'-tetrahydroxyflavone) bioflavonoid found fruits vegetables. exhibits wide variety pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, antiinflammatory anticarcinogenic effects. Recently reported hypoglycemic actions fisetin. Oral administration fisetin (10mg/kg body weight) diabetic rats 30 days established significant (P<0.05) decline blood glucose glycosylated hemoglobin levels significant (P<0.05) increase plasma insulin level. present study activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism assayed establish modulatory actions fisetin maintaining glucose homeostasis. altered activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase liver kidney tissues diabetic rats significantly (P<0.05) reverted near normalcy administration fisetin. Thus, fisetin regulates carbohydrate metabolism modulating key regulatory enzymes hepatic renal tissues diabetic rats.
