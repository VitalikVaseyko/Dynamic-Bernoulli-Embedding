 Pyruvate kinase purified homogeneity moderate thermophile, Bacillus stearothermophilus. molecular weight enzyme found 250,000 gel filtration 242,000 sedimentation analysis. enzyme consisted four identical subunits molecular weight 62,000-64,000. remarkable differences thermophilic enzyme mesophilic enzymes amino acid composition, secondary structure, mono- di-valent cation requirements activity specificity nucleoside diphosphates. thermophilic enzyme stable high temperature longer period storage lower temperature. specific activity relatively high even low temperature (30 degrees C). enzyme exhibited homotropic positive cooperativity phosphoenol-pyruvate, ADP. allosterically activated AMP, ribose 5-phosphate nucleoside monophosphates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Activation AMP ribose 5-phosphate, inhibition inorganic phosphate also observed even physiological temperature (60 degrees C) thermophile.
