 BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia widely used biomarker, associated initial severity poor outcomes. increased circulating lactate concentration proposed result part mismatch oxygen delivery demand organs. However, mechanisms may participate. particular, metabolic reprogramming similar Warburg effect initially described cancer cells could lead increased lactate production immune cells lymphocytes sepsis. objective study set protocol lactate measurement lymphocytes, evaluate whether lactate production lymphocytes increased septic shock patients. METHODS: first optimized protocols lactate pyruvate measurements lymphocytes purified healthy volunteers' blood, either stimulated phytohaemagglutinine (PHA) left untreated. conducted pilot study confirm feasibility protocol samples septic shock patients. RESULTS: PHA stimulation induced aerobic glycolysis human lymphocytes ex vivo, increased lactate pyruvate productions. correctly measure phenomenon, minimal cell number 250,000 optimal culture duration 40 h. also observed significant correlation lactate concentration lymphocytes culture supernatants. able measure lactate concentration lymphocytes septic shock patients. preliminary results showed intra-lymphocyte lactate concentration different patients healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: protocol tested larger cohort patients. association immune cell metabolic reprogramming measured lactate concentration cells functionality represents exciting field research.
