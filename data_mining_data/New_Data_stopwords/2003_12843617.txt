 previously identified pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA rapidly induced mRNA fibrates suggested possibility coupled induction PDK4 reduction serum triglyceride fatty acid levels cause protein degradation muscles. investigate whether drugs known risk rhabdomyolysis induce PDK4 mRNA skeletal muscle, effects statins new quinolon anti-bacterial drugs expression levels mRNA examined using mice cultured cells. Several statins new quinolon anti-bacterial drugs solely induced PDK4 mRNA muscle efficiently fibrates least combinations synergistic. present results suggest induction PDK4 mRNA involved drug induced acute rhabdomyolysis muscle restricted use fatty acids major energy source.
