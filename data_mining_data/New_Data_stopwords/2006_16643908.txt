 Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex regulated reversible phosphorylation Pda1p subunit. provide evidence Pda1p phosphorylated mitochondrial kinase Yil042cp. Deletion YOR090c, encoding putative mitochondrial phosphatase, results decreased PDH activity, indicating Yor090cp acts corresponding PDH phosphatase. demonstrate means blue native gel electrophoresis tandem affinity purification enzymes associated PDH complex.
