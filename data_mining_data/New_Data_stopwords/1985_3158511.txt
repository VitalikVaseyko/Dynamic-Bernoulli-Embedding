 evaluated possibility diacylglycerol may function second messenger insulin action. end, employed 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) mimic diacylglycerol BC3H-1 myocytes. Like insulin, TPA provoked rapid increases 2-deoxyglucose transport pyruvate dehydrogenase activity mature insulin-responsive BC3H-1 cultured myocytes. TPA also stimulated amino acid uptake, evidenced uptake alpha-methylaminoisobutyric acid; relatively slow time course effect paralleled insulin. contrast, effects TPA apparent undifferentiated BC3H-1 myoblasts, also unresponsive insulin. insulin-like effects myocytes appeared specific TPA, biologically active phorbol diester activates protein kinase C, tested phorbol derivatives without effect. Effects maximally effective concentrations TPA insulin nonadditive. Two synthetic diacylglycerols, 1,2-diolien 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, also provoked insulin-like effects 2-deoxyglucose transport. Since insulin rapidly increases diacylglycerol levels cells, TPA mimics diacylglycerol biochemically, possible insulin may control cellular processes changes diacylglycerol.
