 mutant strain (bd) Neurospora, biological clock visibly expressed growing front mycelial mat sequential periods conidiating (spore-forming) non-conidiating growth. edges (8 mm) mycelium different ages sampled 31 h period, adenine nucleotide levels enzymatically assayed. edge region, total adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) level showed oscillation, minimum 0.5 mumol/g (residual dry weight) maximum 6.0 mumol/g. total adenosine 5'-triphosphate level total adenosine 5'-diphosphate level showed obvious oscillation. oscillation AMP content many properties circadian rhythm. period 22 h long, phase-shifted light, damped continuous illumination. oscillation AMP level led oscillation overall cellular energy charge 0.65 0.93. However, energy charge calculation take account possible compartmentalization AMP, therefore must interpretated cautiously. suggested underlying cause oscillation AMP level could rhythmic, partial uncoupling mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
