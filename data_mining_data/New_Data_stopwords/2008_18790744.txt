 Akt/mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling plays important role tumorigenesis dysregulated many tumors, especially metastatic prostate cancers. Curcumin shown effectively prevent inhibit prostate cancer vivo inhibit Akt/mTOR signaling vitro, mechanism(s) remains unclear. Here, show curcumin concentration- time-dependently inhibited phosphorylation Akt, mTOR, downstream substrates human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, inhibitory effect acts downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1. Overexpression constitutively activated Akt disruption TSC1-TSC2 complex small interfering RNA gene knockout partially restored curcumin-mediated inhibition mTOR downstream signaling, indicating primary effectors curcumin-mediated inhibition Akt/mTOR signaling. Curcumin also activated 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases; however, inhibition kinases failed rescue inhibition curcumin. Finally, shown inhibition Akt/mTOR signaling curcumin resulted calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatase-dependent dephosphorylation. study reveals profound effects curcumin Akt/mTOR signaling network PC-3 cells provides new mechanisms anticancer effects curcumin.
