 Accumulating evidence reveals metabolic cell survival pathways closely related, sharing common signaling molecules. Hexokinase catalyzes phosphorylation glucose, rate-limiting first step glycolysis. Hexokinase II (HK-II) predominant isoform insulin-sensitive tissues heart, skeletal muscle, adipose tissues. also upregulated many types tumors associated enhanced aerobic glycolysis tumor cells, Warburg effect. addition fundamental role glycolysis, HK-II increasingly recognized component survival signaling nexus. review summarizes recent advances understanding protective role HK-II, controlling cellular growth, preventing mitochondrial death pathway enhancing autophagy, particular focus interaction HK-II Akt/mTOR pathway integrate metabolic status control cell survival.
