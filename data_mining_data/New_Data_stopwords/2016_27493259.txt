 Patients autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) typically carry mutation either PKD1 PKD2 gene, leads massive cyst formation kidneys. However, large intrafamilial variation progression rate ADPKD suggests involvement additional factors type mutation. identification factors increase understanding ADPKD could ultimately help development clinically relevant therapy. review addresses mechanisms various biologic processes influence cyst formation cyst growth, thereby explaining important part inter- intrafamilial variability ADPKD. Numerous studies many laboratories provide compelling evidence influence cyst formation spatiotemporal gene inactivation, genetic context, metabolic status, presence existing cysts, whether kidneys challenged renal injury. Collectively, solid basis provided concept probability cyst formation determined functional PKD protein levels biologic context. model findings graphic representation called cystic probability landscape, providing robust conceptual understanding cells sometimes form cysts.
