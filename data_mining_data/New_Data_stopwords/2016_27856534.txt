 major metabolic aberration associated cancer change glucose metabolism. Isoform selection glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase implicated metabolic phenotype cancer cells, specific pyruvate kinase isoforms suggested support divergent energetic biosynthetic requirements cells tumors normal tissues. PKM2 isoform expression closely linked embryogenesis, tissue repair, cancer. contrast, forced expression PKM1 isoform associated reduced tumor cell proliferation. Here, discuss role PKM2 plays cells provide historical perspective study PKM2 contributed understanding cancer metabolism. also review recent studies raise important questions regard role PKM2 normal cancer cell metabolism.
