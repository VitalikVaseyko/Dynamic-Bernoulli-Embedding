 OBJECTIVE: aim characterise experimental model preconditioning isolated rabbit cardiomyocytes determine role adenosine receptor subtypes initiation protective response. METHODS: Isolated myocytes subjected 5 min preincubation presence absence glucose various agonists antagonists adenosine receptors. Ischaemic pelleting preceded 30 min postincubation period. Rate extent injury ischaemia determined sequential sampling pelleted cells assessment trypan blue permeability following 85 mOsm swelling. RESULTS: Myocytes preconditioned 30-50% reduction injury 5 min glucose-free preincubation. Substitution 5 mM pyruvate glucose preincubation prevent protective response. Protection maintained 60-180 min postincubation period. Protection blocked 100 microM non-specific adenosine A1/A2 antagonist SPT, added preincubation ischaemic pellet. Calphostin C, specific protein kinase C inhibitor 200 nM, added ischaemic pellet blocked protection. Preincubation R-PIA, adenosine A1 agonist, precondition A1 selective dose 1 microM, 100 microM. selective A2 agonist CGS 12680 (1 microM) precondition. selective A1/A3 adenosine agonist, APNEA, preconditioned 1 microM 200 nM dose levels. Preconditioning induced either 200 nM APNEA glucose-free preincubation blocked 200 nM 10 microM A1 antagonist DPCPX, extremely low affinity A3 receptors, blocked 1 microM A1/A3 adenosine antagonist BW 1433U83. CONCLUSIONS: Preconditioning induced isolated myocytes 5 min preincubation/30 min postincubation protocol, similar protection induced adenosine agonists A3, A1 selectivity. Preconditioning blocked non-selective selective A1/A3 adenosine antagonists specific protein kinase C inhibitor, A1 antagonists little affinity A3 receptors. results suggest preconditioning isolated rabbit myocytes requires participation adenosine receptors agonist/antagonist binding characteristics A3 subtype, likely mediated activation protein kinase C.
