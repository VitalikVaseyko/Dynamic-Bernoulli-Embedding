 Cancer metabolism field research founded almost 100 years ago Otto Warburg, described propensity cancers convert glucose lactate despite presence oxygen, yeast diminishes glycolytic metabolism known Pasteur effect. past 20 years, resurgence interest cancer metabolism provided significant insights processes involved maintenance metabolism non-proliferating cells proliferative metabolism, regulated proto-oncogenes tumor suppressors normal proliferating cells. cancer cells, depending driving oncogenic event, metabolism re-wired nutrient import, redox homeostasis, protein quality control, biosynthesis support cell growth division. general, resting cells rely oxidative metabolism, proliferating cells rewire metabolism toward glycolysis, favors many biosynthetic pathways proliferation. Oncogenes MYC, BRAF, KRAS, PI3K documented rewire metabolism favor proliferation. cell intrinsic mechanisms, however, insufficient drive tumorigenesis immune surveillance continuously seeks destroy neo-antigenic tumor cells. regard, evasion cancer cells immunity involves checkpoints blunt cytotoxic cells, also attenuated metabolic tumor microenvironment, rich immuno-modulating metabolites lactate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, kynurenine, proton (low pH). such, full understanding tumor metabolism requires appreciation convergence cancer cell intrinsic metabolism tumor microenvironment including stromal immune cells.
