 sycamore cells grown nitrate opposed glutamate higher pentose phosphate pathway carbon flux relative glycolysis early stages cell growth nitrate assimilation active. high pentose phosphate pathway activity compared glycolysis nitrate grown cells accompanied enhanced levels hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate de-hydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase transketolase. significant increase activity solely glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase. suggested increased pentose phosphate pathway activity nitrate grown cells correlated demand nitrite assimilation NADPH.
