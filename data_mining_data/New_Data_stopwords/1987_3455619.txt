 biosynthesis human preproparathyroid hormone (hpreproPTH) processing mature parathyroid hormone (hPTH) investigated yeast. Cells transformed plasmid carried fusion gene made yeast pyruvate kinase promoter, complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding slightly modified form hpreproPTH transcription termination signal yeast triosephosphate-isomerase. transformed yeast cells identified protein recognized PTH antiserum and, gel electrophoresis, comigrated hpreproPTH marker. amino-terminal sequence protein consistent hpreproPTH, indicating hormone precursor processed. localized inside cell, analyzed pulse-chase experiments trypsin accessibility intact lysed spheroplasts. contrast, mRNA yeast cells human parathyroid tissue translated preproPTH reticulocyte lysate supplemented canine pancreatic microsomes, preproPTHs mRNAs transported cleaved identical efficiencies. conclude hpreproPTH synthesized yeast recognized processed like precursor secreted protein yeast secretory apparatus.
