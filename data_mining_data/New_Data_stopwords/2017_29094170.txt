 Prostate cancer (PCa) leading cause death among men. dysregulation metabolism autophagy contributes progression PCa. transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) implicated regulation metabolism autophagy. confirmed Sp1 overexpressed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. However, roles Sp1 PCa metabolism autophagy remain unclear. Thus, present study, retrieved GSE35988 dataset Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database reinvestigate Sp1 expression role PCa.We found PCa, Sp1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth, aerobic glycolysis, hypoxia-induced autophagy, accompanied increased G1 cell cycle arrest. Pearson correlation indicated pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) positively correlated Sp1 expression. Western blot analysis demonstrated Sp1 directly regulates PKM2; therefore, Sp1 modulates metabolism autophagy CRPC. Western blot analysis luciferase reporter assay also indicated tumor suppressor miR-361-5p inversely regulates Sp1 directly targeting binding site 3'UTR Sp1. miR-361-5p overexpression presented effects similar Sp1 depletion PCa. summary, study first demonstrate miR-361-5p suppresses Sp1/PKM2 axis, consequently affecting progression PCa metabolism autophagy PCa cells. Therefore, targeting miR-361-5p/Sp1/PKM2 pathway considerable clinical significance preventing malignant progression PCa.
