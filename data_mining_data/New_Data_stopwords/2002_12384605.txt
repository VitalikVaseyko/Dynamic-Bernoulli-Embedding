 present prototype new database tool, GeneCensus, focuses comparing genomes globally, terms collective properties many genes, rather terms attributes single gene (e.g. sequence similarity particular ortholog). comparisons presented visual fashion web GeneCensus.org. system concentrates two types comparisons: (i) trees based sharing generalized protein families genomes, (ii) whole pathway analysis terms activity levels. trees, developed module (TreeViewer) clusters genomes terms folds, superfamilies orthologs--all considered generalized 'families' 'protein parts'--they share, compares resulting trees side-by-side built sequence similarity individual genes (e.g. traditional tree built ribosomal similarity). also include comparisons trees built whole-genome dinucleotide codon composition. pathway comparisons, implemented module (PathwayPainter) graphically depicts, selected metabolic pathways, fluxes expression levels associated enzymes (i.e. generalized 'activities'). One can, consequently, compare organisms (and organism states) terms representations systemic quantities. Develop ment module involved compiling, calculating standardizing flux expression information many different sources. illustrate pathway analysis enzymes involved central metabolism. able show that, degree, flux expression fluctuations characteristic values different sections central metabolism control points system (e.g. hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase citric synthase) tend especially variable flux expression. TreeViewer PathwayPainter modules connect information sources related individual-gene organism properties (e.g. single-gene structural annotation viewer).
