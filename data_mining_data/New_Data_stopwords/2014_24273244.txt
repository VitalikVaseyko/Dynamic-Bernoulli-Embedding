 MOTIVATION: Pathway analysis tools powerful strategy analyze 'omics' data field systems biology. metabolic perspective, several pathway definitions found literature, one appropriate particular study. Recently, novel pathway concept termed carbon flux paths (CFPs) introduced benchmarked existing approaches, showing clear advantage finding linear pathways given source target metabolite. CFPs simple paths metabolite-metabolite graph satisfy typical constraints stoichiometric models: mass balancing thermodynamics (irreversibility). addition, CFPs guarantee carbon exchange intermediate steps, source target metabolites consequently false positive solutions may arise. pathways often lack biological interest, particularly studying biosynthetic degradation routes metabolite. overcome issue, amend formulation CFP, account atomic fate information. approach termed atomic CFP (aCFP). RESULTS: means side-by-side comparison medium scale metabolic network Escherichia Coli, show aCFP provides biologically relevant pathways CFP, canonical pathways easily recovered, reflects benefits removing false positives. addition, demonstrate aCFP successfully applied genome-scale metabolic networks. quality genome-scale atomic reconstruction improved, methods one presented undoubtedly value interpret 'omics' data.
