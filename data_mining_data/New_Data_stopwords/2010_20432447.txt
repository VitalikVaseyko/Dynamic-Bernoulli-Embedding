 Selective amino acid restriction targets mitochondria resulting DU145 PC3 prostate cancer cell death. study shows restriction tyrosine phenylalanine (Tyr/Phe), glutamine (Gln), methionine (Met) differentially modulates glucose metabolism, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), p53, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) two cell lines. DU145 cells, Gln Met restriction increase glucose consumption, Tyr/Phe restriction not. Addition glucose culture media diminishes cell death induced Tyr/Phe-restriction. Addition pyruvate reduces cell death due Tyr/Phe Gln restriction. Tyr/Phe, Gln Met restriction increase phosphorylation GSK3beta-Ser(9), phosphorylation p53-Ser(15) reduce mitochondrial localization PDH. Addition glucose pyruvate cultures significantly reverses alterations GSK3beta, p53 PDH induced amino acid restriction. p53-null PC3 cells, Tyr/Phe, Gln Met restriction decreases glucose consumption, reduces phosphorylation Akt-Ser(473), increases phosphorylation GSK3beta-Ser(9). Addition pyruvate glucose reduces death Met-restricted cells. Addition glucose increases phosphorylation Akt-Ser(473) amino acid-restricted cells reduces phosphorylation GSK3beta-Ser(9) Tyr/Phe Gln restricted cells increases phosphorylation GSK3beta-Ser(9) Met restricted cells. Addition pyruvate reduces phosphorylation GSK3beta-Ser(9) amino acid-restricted cells. summary, cell death induced specific amino acid restriction dependent closely related modulation glucose metabolism. GSK3beta (DU145 PC3) p53 (DU145) crucial switches connecting metabolism signaling molecules cell survival amino acid restriction.
