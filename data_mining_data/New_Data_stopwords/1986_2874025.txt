 single L-type pyruvate kinase (PK) gene seems exist per haploid genome. expressed liver, kidney small intestine form three mRNA species 2, 2.2 3.2 X 10(3) bases (kb). three species polyadenylated translatable L-type subunit. Primer extension experiments demonstrate three PK mRNAs 5' ends. Nuclease S1 protection experiments various cDNA 3' genomic probes indicate different mRNA species differ length 3' noncoding region. mechanism responsible production three transcripts seems use alternative unusual polyadenylation sites. Run-on assays specific probes recognizing 3.2-kb three mRNA species show transcription proceeds across gene similar rate. means process involved generation three transcripts posttranscriptional event, probably due different sites endonucleolytic cleavage primary transcripts extending 3' gene region encoding mature mRNAs. ratio different PK mRNA species is, certain extent, tissue-specific changes development. role 'identifier sequence' located 3' noncoding sequence 3.2-kb species tissue-specific use alternative polyadenylation sites discussed.
