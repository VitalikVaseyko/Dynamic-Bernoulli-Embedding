 Rabbit proximal tubule cells primary culture revert gluconeogenesis glycolysis. determine whether glucose insulin deprivation culture medium could prevent metabolic conversion without loss differentiation, rabbit proximal tubule cells cultured hormonally defined medium free glucose insulin compared rabbit proximal tubule cells cultured medium supplemented 17.5 mM glucose 5 micrograms/ml insulin. two culture conditions, RPT cells grew similar rate reached confluency within 4-5 days. Patterns enzyme activity, including brush-border hydrolases, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase glutathione-S-transferases function culture time comparable two media. growth phase glucose- insulin-free medium, cells showed higher sodium-dependent glucose uptake. Scanning electron microscopy revealed high density microvilli confluency regardless culture conditions. presence absence glucose insulin, activities gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, well basal pyruvate-stimulated glucose production fell markedly function time. contrast, glucose insulin deprivation greatly reduced lactate production rate activities glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase.
