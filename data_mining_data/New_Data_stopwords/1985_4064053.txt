 activities selected glycolytic enzymes breast tumor tissues examined based earlier studies showing relationship therapy and/or prognosis breast cancer tissue enzyme. present study, five glycolytic enzymatic activities (pyruvate kinase [PK], glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD], phosphohexose-isomerase [PHI], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], 6-phospho-glucocate dehydrogenase [6PGD]) measured cytosol (105,000 g) 57 breast carcinomas 22 benign breast lesions. Nucleic acids DNA also determined. results related wet weight tissue, total tissue cytosol proteins, DNA. various means expressing results compared. correlations satisfactory except PHI LDH. cases, might due blood contamination. enzyme activities content lower benign breast lesions breast carcinomas irrespective way results expressed.
