 assess toxic effect Cr energy metabolism, heterotrophic Euglena gracilis grown medium prompts high yield biomass presence different Cr(VI) Cr(III) concentrations. cell growth IC(5)(0) value 12 >250muM Cr(VI) Cr(III), respectively; cells chromium accumulated fraction compartmentalized mitochondria, synthesis cysteine glutathione induced. Respiration control isolated mitochondria strongly inhibited added Cr(VI) Cr(III) L-lactate succinate substrates. turn, cellular mitochondrial respiration, respiratory Complexes I, III IV, glycolysis cytosolic NAD(+)-alcohol -lactate dehydrogenases cells cultured Cr(VI) significantly lower control, whereas AOX external NADH dehydrogenase activities unaltered increased, respectively. Addition Cr(VI) Cr(III) isolated mitochondria cytosol control- Cr(VI)-grown cells induced inhibition respiration, respiratory Complexes III, IV AOX, glycolytic pyruvate kinase; whereas Complex I, external NADH dehydrogenase, glycolytic enzymes unaffected. Protein contents mitochondrial Complexes I, III, IV V, ANT diminished Cr(VI)-grown cells. Decreased respiration glycolysis induced Cr(VI) resulted lower cellular ATP content. Results suggested Cr(VI) cytotoxicity altered gene expression (as widely documented) hence enzyme content, induced oxidative stress, also related direct enzyme inhibition; Cr(III) also cytotoxic although higher concentrations. findings establish new paradigms chromium toxicity: Cr(VI) direct enzyme inhibition non-innocuous external Cr(III) toxicity.
