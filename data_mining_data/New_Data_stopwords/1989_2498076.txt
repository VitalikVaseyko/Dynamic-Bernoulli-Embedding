 M2-type pyruvate kinases (M2-PK) isolated human leukocytes erythrocytes patient erythrocyte PK hyperactivity. kinetic characteristics patient erythrocyte M2-PK similar leukocyte M2-PK except Hill coefficient phosphoenol pyruvate kinetics showed little difference values. patient erythrocyte M2-PK displayed complete immunological identity leukocyte M2-PK immunodiffusion, immunoblotting immunoneutralization. sensitivity proteolysis trypsin electrophoretic migration different conditions similar M2-PK origins. results suggest identity M2-PK abnormally present erythrocytes M2-PK leukocytes.
