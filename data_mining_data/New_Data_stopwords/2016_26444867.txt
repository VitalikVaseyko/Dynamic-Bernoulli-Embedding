 aerobic succinate-producing Escherichia coli mutant compared wild-type quantitatively analyzing metabolome fluxome, glucose-limited steady-state succinate excess dynamic conditions, order identify targets strain engineering towards efficient succinate production. mutant four functional mutations conditions investigated: increased expression succinate exporter (DcuC), deletion succinate importer (Dct), deletion succinate dehydrogenase (SUCDH) expression PEP carboxylase (PPC) increased capacity due point mutation. steady-state dynamic patterns intracellular metabolite levels fluxes response changes used locate quantitative differences physiology/metabolism mutant strain. Unexpectedly mutant higher energy efficiency, indicated much lower rate oxygen consumption, glucose-limited conditions, caused deletion transcription factors IclR ArcA. Furthermore mutant much lower uptake capacity succinate (26-fold) oxygen (17-fold succinate excess) compared wild-type strain. mutant strain produced 7.9 mmol.CmolX(-1).h(-1) succinate chemostat cultivation, showing choice applied genetic modifications successful strategy. Furthermore, applied genetic modifications resulted multiple large changes metabolite levels (FBP, pyruvate, 6PG, NAD(+) /NADH ratio, alpha-ketogluarate) corresponding large changes fluxes. Compared wild-type considerable flux shift occurred tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidative part pentose phosphate pathway, including inversion pyruvate kinase flux. mutant responded differently excess succinate, remarkable possible reversal TCA cycle. mutant wild-type showed homeostatic behaviour respect energy charge. contrast, large changes redox ratios (NAD(+) /NADH) occurred wild-type, mutant showed even larger changes. large redox change associated reversal flux directions. observed large flexibility central metabolism following genetic (deletions) environmental (substrate excess) perturbations mutant, indicates introducing efficient succinate exporter could result even higher succinate production rate.
