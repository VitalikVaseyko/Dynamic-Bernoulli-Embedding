 Hamacanthins class antibacterial bisindole alkaloids isolated marine sponges. Based structure-activity relationships silico MRSA PK binding analysis bisindole alkaloids, authors designed new hamacanthin B derivatives evaluated antibacterial activities drug-resistant pathogens. Racemates synthetic products resolved enantiomers chiral separation using cellulose column, antibacterial activities compared. Unsaturation central heterocyclic ring structure bromine substitution indole moiety found enhance antibacterial activities hamacanthin B analogues.
