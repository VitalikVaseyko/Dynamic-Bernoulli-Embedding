 BACKGROUND: Phlebotomus orientalis main sandfly vector visceral leishmaniasis north northwest Ethiopia. CDC light traps sticky traps commonly used monitoring sandfly populations. However, trapping efficiency greatly influenced various environmental factors including moonlight lunar periodicity. view that, current study assessed effect moonlight lunar periodicity performance light traps collecting P. orientalis. METHODS: Trapping P. orientalis Phlebotomus spp. conducted 7 months December 2012 June 2013 using CDC light traps sticky traps peri-domestic agricultural fields. Throughout trapping periods, collections sandfly specimens carried 4 nights per month, totaling 28 trapping nights coincided four lunar phases (viz., first quarter, third quarter, new full moon) distributed month. RESULTS: total, 13,533 sandflies eight Phlebotomus species (P. orientalis, P. bergeroti, P. rodhaini, P. duboscqi, P. papatasi, P. martini, P. lesleyae P. heischi) recorded. predominant species P. orientalis trapping sites methods collection lunar phases. significant difference (P < 0.05) observed mean numbers P. orientalis Phlebotomus spp. caught CDC light traps among four lunar phases. highest mean number (231.13 +/- 36.27 flies/trap/night) P. orientalis collected new moon phases, moonlight absent. Fewer sandflies attracted light traps full moon. However, number P. orientalis Phlebotomus spp. sticky traps differ density among four lunar phases (P = 0.122). CONCLUSION: Results current study demonstrated attraction trapping efficiency CDC light traps largely influenced presence moonlight, especially full moon. Therefore, sampling sandflies using light traps estimate population density epidemiological studies field take effect moonlight lunar periodicity account trapping efficacy light traps.
