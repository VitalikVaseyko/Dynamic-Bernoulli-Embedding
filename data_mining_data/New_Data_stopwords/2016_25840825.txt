 Pyruvate kinase M2, important metabolic enzyme, promotes aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) facilitate cancer cell proliferation. Unravelling status important glycolytic pathway enzyme sub-lethal doses etoposide, commonly used anti-proliferative genotoxic drug induce mild/moderate DNA damage HeLa cells model system discern effect on: PKM2 expression, phosphorylation, dimer: tetramer ratio, activity associated effects, pertinent. Protein expression phosphorylation PKM2 HeLa cells estimated using Western blotting. protein lysate also used estimate total pyruvate kinase activity total dimer: tetramer content evaluated using glycerol gradient ultra-centrifugation. Intracellular PEP estimated manually using standard curve; NADPH assessed NADPH estimation kit. Unpaired test two-way-ANOVA used statistical analysis. relative decrease PKM2 expression subsequent dose time dependent increase Y105-phosphorylation observed. concomitant increase PKM2 dimer content Y105-phosphorylation responsible reduced PKM2 activity promoted PEP accumulation NADPH production, representing increased metabolic flux PPP, feature favours cancer cells. apparent sub-lethal doses etoposide induced inadequate damage DNA cancer cells culture promoted pro-survival conditions due Y105-phosphorylation PKM2, stable dimerization inactivation, unique association known earlier, indicating might happen tumour revivals recurrences.
