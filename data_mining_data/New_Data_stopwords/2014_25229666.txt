 Non-proliferating cells generate bulk cellular ATP fully oxidizing respiratory substrates mitochondria. Respiratory substrates cross mitochondrial outer membrane one channel, voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC). matrix, respiratory substrates oxidized tricarboxylic acid cycle generate mostly NADH oxidized respiratory chain generate proton motive force comprised mainly membrane potential (DeltaPsi) synthesize ATP. Mitochondrial DeltaPsi drives release ATP(4-) matrix exchange ADP(3-) cytosol via adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) located mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus, mitochondrial function non-proliferating cells drives high cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio, essential inhibit glycolysis. contrast, bioenergetics Warburg phenotype proliferating cells characterized enhanced aerobic glycolysis suppression mitochondrial metabolism. Suppressed mitochondrial function leads lower production mitochondrial ATP hence lower cytosolic ATP/ADP ratios favor enhanced glycolysis. Thus, cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio key feature determines cell metabolism predominantly oxidative glycolytic. Here, describe two novel mechanisms explain suppression mitochondrial metabolism cancer cells: relative closure VDAC free tubulin inactivation ANT. mechanisms contribute low ATP/ADP ratios activate glycolysis.
