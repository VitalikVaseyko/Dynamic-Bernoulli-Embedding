 Lung cancer remains leading cause cancer-related death worldwide, one-third diagnosed locally advanced (stage III) disease. Preoperative induction chemo-radiotherapy key treatment patients, however conventional cisplatin based approaches apparently reached plateau effectiveness. search new therapies, targeting tumor metabolism revealed interesting option improve patient's responses. describe importance PGC-1alpha GAPDH/MT-CO1 ratio levels surrogates Warburg effect series 28 stage III NSCLC patients, PFS, OS PET uptake. Moreover, results show great variability tumors different individuals, ranging glycolytic OXPHOS-dependent tumors, compromises success therapies directed metabolism. sense, using 3 different cell lines, describe relevance Warburg effect response metabolism-targeted therapies. Specifically, show inhibitory effect metformin cell viability depends cell's dependence OXPHOS system. results cell lines, together results PGC-1alpha GAPDH/MT-CO1 biomarkers patient's biopsies, would point type patients would benefit use drugs.
