 quantitative study effect carnitine deficiency expression glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes performed using juvenile visceral steatosis mice systemically deficient carnitine. amounts glucokinase L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA reduced homozygotes, compared heterozygotes normal controls 2 8 weeks. Liver-type phosphofructokinase, however, differ significantly. abundance fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA unchanged 2 8 weeks. level phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA increased slightly 2 weeks, 8 weeks. part changes could explained plasma glucose insulin level. Carnitine administration restored mRNA enzymes normal levels. results suggest carnitine deficiency affects expression liver enzymes.
