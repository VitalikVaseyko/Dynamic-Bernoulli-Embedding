 Yeast poly(adenylic acid)-containing messenger RNA isolated total cellular RNA affinity chromatography poly(uridylic acid)-cellulose. relative complexity isolated yeast mRNA assessed hybridization analysis complementary DNA synthesized isolated messenger RNA (mRNA) viral reverse transcriptase. Approximately 25% mRNA hybridized apparent Crt1/2 5 X 10(-3) mol sl.(-1), remainder hybridized average Crt1/2 10(-1) mol sl.-1. Poly(adenylic acid)-containing yeast mRNA translated vitro wheat germ cell-free extract, major polypeptides synthesized molecular weight major proteins present cell. Four proteins identified coelectrophoresis immune precipitation pyruvate kinase, enolase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. data demonstrate agreement hybridization results yeast contains major mRNA species glycolytic enzyme mRNAs make part major fraction. procedure outlined preparation yeast mRNA essentially free ribosomal RNA contamination enriched major mRNAs present cell.
