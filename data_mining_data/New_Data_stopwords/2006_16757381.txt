 Induction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) conserves glucose substrates gluconeogenesis thereby helps regulate blood glucose levels starvation. report retinoic acids (RA) well Trichostatin (TSA), inhibitor histone deacetylase (HDAC), regulate PDK4 gene expression. Two retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) bind activate transcription present human PDK4 (hPDK4) proximal promoter. Sp1 CCAAT box binding factor (CBF) bind region two RAREs. Mutation either Sp1 CBF site significantly decreases basal expression, transactivation RXRalpha/RARalpha/RA, ability TSA stimulate hPDK4 gene transcription. chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, RA TSA increase acetylation histones bound proximal promoter well occupancy CBP Sp1. Interaction p300/CBP E1A completely prevented hPDK4 gene activation RXRalpha/RARalpha/RA TSA. p300/CBP may enhance acetylation histones bound hPDK4 promoter cooperate Sp1 CBF stimulate transcription hPDK4 gene response RA TSA.
