 ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: rate production reactive oxygen species (ROS) determined mitochondrial metabolic rate. turn, excessive ROS damage mitochondrial function, linked aging neurodegenerative conditions. One possible path prevent oxidative stress could achieved reducing mitochondrial respiration favor less efficient ATP production via glycolysis. shift energy metabolism known 'Warburg effect'. Geissoschizine methyl ether (GM) one active components responsible psychotropic effects Yokukansan, herbal preparation widely used China Japan. AIM STUDY: GM protects neurons glutamate-induced oxidative cytotoxicity regulating mitochondrial function suppressing ROS generation. investigated protective mechanism GM glutamate-induced oxidative stress neuronal cells. MATERIALS METHODS: current study performed primary neurons HT22 cells, hippocampus neuronal cell line. Cell viability measured Calcein assay. H2DCFDA staining used intracellular ROS measurement. GSH level measured using GSH-Glo luminescence-based assay. Mitochondrial respiration glycolysis measured Seahorse Bioscience XFe 96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Protein levels analyzed western blot analysis. RESULTS: GM prevented glutamate-induced cytotoxicity HT-22 neuronal cell line even 9-hour exposure delay. GM blocked glutamate-induced intracellular ROS accumulation suppressing mitochondrial respiration. Further, found GM up-regulated glycolysis pentose-phosphate pathway, involved production intracellular reducing agent, NADPH. addition, GM protected primary cortical neurons glutamate buthioninesulfoximine toxicity. CONCLUSION: GM prevents glutamate-induced oxidative damage reducing mitochondrial respiration, suppresses ROS generation. addition, GM up-regulates glycolysis compensate energy depletion induced mitochondrial respiration inhibition. Overall, study first report GM protects neurons oxidative toxicity shifting energy metabolism mitochondrial respiration glycolysis.
