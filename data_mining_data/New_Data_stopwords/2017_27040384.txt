 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays pivotal role growth, survival metabolic reprogramming cancer cells. Here, presented first time tanshinone inhibited human esophagus cancer cell growth miR-122-mediated PKM2 down-regulation pathway. Tanshinone inhibited cell proliferation induced cell cycle arrest phase human Ec109 cells. expected, tanshinone down-regulated PKM2 mRNA protein expression Ec109 cells. Given findings, investigated microRNAs regulation PKM2 confirmed miR-122 targeting PKM2. Moreover, found tanshinone A-induced up-regulation miR-122 expression inhibited PKM2 expression Ec109 cells. Meanwhile, tanshinone inhibited proliferation miR122-medated PKM2 down-regulation. demonstrated anticancer activity tanshinone targeted metabolic regulation miR-122/PKM2 human esophagus cancer cells. Taken together, results revealed tanshinone targeting PKM2-mediated metabolic reprogramming play important role inhibition esophageal cancer cell growth.
