 Propionate inhibited metabolic flux pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction perfused rat liver perfusate concentration propionate 10 mM perfusate pyruvate concentration held within physiological range. higher propionate concentrations (e.g., 20 mM) inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase alleviated activation state pyruvate dehydrogenase complex nearly doubled. livers perfused high pyruvate concentration (e.g., 5 mM), propionate coinfusion concentrations inhibited rate pyruvate decarboxylation. Additional studies performed liver mitochondria maintained State 3 ATP/ADP NADH/NAD+ ratios held constant. Low propionate concentrations (e.g., 0.5 mM) inactivated mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, whereas propionate levels excess 1 mM activated enzyme complex. CoA distribution analyses mitochondrial incubations indicated presence either 0.5 10 mM propionate caused substantial accumulation propionyl-CoA methylmalonyl-CoA expense free CoASH. Experiments performed ratios various acyl-CoA derivatives CoASH varied sequentially increasing L-carnitine concentrations incubation. inverse relationship propionyl-CoA/CoASH methylmalonyl-CoA/CoASH ratios activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex observed. Experiments using freeze-thawed liver mitochondrial membranes indicated propionate protected pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ATP-mediated inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. contention inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex low propionate levels may due increase mitochondrial acyl-CoA/CoASH ratios, whereas activation enzyme complex demonstrated high propionate levels due inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase manner similar caused pyruvate dichloroacetic acid.
