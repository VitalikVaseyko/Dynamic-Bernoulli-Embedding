 previously demonstrated insulin neuroprotective role oxidative stress, deleterious condition associated diabetes, ischemia, age-related neurodegenerative diseases. study, investigated effect insulin neuronal glucose uptake metabolism oxidative stress rat primary cortical neurons. oxidative stress, insulin stimulates neuronal glucose uptake subsequent metabolism pyruvate, restoring intracellular ATP phosphocreatine. Insulin also increases intracellular decreases extracellular adenosine, counteracting effect oxidative stress. Insulin effects apparently mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-K extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways. Extracellular adenosine oxidative stress largely inhibited blockade ecto-5'-nucleotidase, suggesting extracellular adenosine results preferentially ATP release catabolism. Moreover, insulin appears interfere ATP release induced oxidative stress, regulating extracellular adenosine levels. conclusion, insulin neuroprotection oxidative stress-mediated damage involves 1) stimulation glucose uptake metabolism, increasing energy levels intracellular adenosine and, ultimately, uric acid formation 2) decrease extracellular adenosine, may reduce facilitatory activity adenosine receptors.
