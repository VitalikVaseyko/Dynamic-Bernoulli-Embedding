 Gene expression profiling offered new insights postmortem molecular changes associated meat quality. acquire reliable transcript quantification, high quality RNA required. objective study analyze integrity RNA isolated chicken skeletal muscle (pectoralis major) capability serving template quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) function postmortem intervals representing end-points evisceration, carcass chilling aging stages chicken abattoirs. Chicken breast muscle dissected carcasses (n = 6) immediately evisceration, one-third sample instantly snap-frozen labeled 20 min postmortem. remaining muscle stored ice next rounds sample collection (1.5 h 6 h postmortem). delayed postmortem duration significantly affect A260/A280 A260/A230 (p>/=0.05), suggesting altered purity total RNA. Apart slight decrease 28s:18s ribosomal RNA ratio 1.5 h samples (p<0.05), value statistically different 20 min 6 h samples (p>/=0.05), indicating intact total RNA 6 h. Abundance reference genes encoding beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), peptidylprolylisomerase (PPIA) TATA box-binding protein (TBP) well meat-quality associated genes (insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) investigated using qPCR. Transcript abundances ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT, PPIA significantly different among postmortem time points (p<0.05). Transcript levels PDK4 PPARD significantly reduced 6 h samples (p<0.05). findings suggest adverse effect prolonged postmortem duration reliability transcript quantification chicken skeletal muscle. best RNA quality, chicken skeletal muscle immediately collected evisceration within 20 min postmortem, rapidly preserved deep freezing.
