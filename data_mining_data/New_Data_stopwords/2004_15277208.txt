 PKC-delta believed play essential role cardiomyocyte growth. present study, investigated effect PKC-delta cardiac metabolism using PKC-delta knockout mice generated laboratories. Proteomic analysis heart protein extracts revealed profound changes enzymes related energy metabolism: certain isoforms glycolytic enzymes, e.g., lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, absent decreased, whereas several enzymes involved lipid metabolism, e.g., phosphorylated isoforms acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, showed marked increase PKC-delta(-/-) hearts. Moreover, PKC-delta deficiency associated changes antioxidants, namely, 1-Cys peroxiredoxin selenium-binding protein 1, posttranslational modifications chaperones involved cytoskeleton regulation, heat shock protein (HSP)20, HSP27, zeta-subunit cytosolic chaperone containing T-complex polypeptide 1. High-resolution NMR analysis cardiac metabolites confirmed significant decrease ratio glycolytic end products (alanine + lactate) end products lipid metabolism (acetate) PKC-delta(-/-) hearts. Taken together, data demonstrate loss PKC-delta causes shift glucose lipid metabolism murine hearts, provide detailed description enzymatic changes proteomic level. consequences metabolic alterations sensitivity myocardial ischemia explored accompanyingpaper (20).
