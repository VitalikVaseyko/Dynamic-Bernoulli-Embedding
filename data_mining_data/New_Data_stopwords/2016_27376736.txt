 Since description Warburg effect 90 years ago, metabolic reprogramming gradually recognized major hallmark cancer cells. Mounting evidence indicates cancer kind metabolic disease, quite distinct conventional perception. metabolic alterations cancer cells extensively observed glucose, lipid, amino acid metabolisms, underlying regulatory mechanisms still poorly understood. Noncoding RNA, also known "dark matter life," functions various mechanisms RNA level regulating different biological pathways. last two decades witnessed booming noncoding RNA study microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), circular RNA (circRNA), PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), etc. chapter, discuss regulatory roles noncoding RNAs cancer metabolism.
