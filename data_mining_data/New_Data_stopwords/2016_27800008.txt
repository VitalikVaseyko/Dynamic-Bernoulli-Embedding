 BACKGROUND: Obesity associated impaired ability switch fatty acid glucose oxidation fasted fed transition, particularly skeletal muscle. However, whether metabolic inflexibility reflected gene transcription level circulatory mononuclear cells (MNC) known. METHODS: whole-body respiratory quotient (RQ) transcriptional regulation genes involved carbohydrate lipid metabolism MNC measured fasting response (up 6 h) high-carbohydrate high-fat meals nine lean insulin-sensitive nine obese insulin-resistant men. RESULTS: Compared lean subjects, obese subjects impaired ability increase RQ switch fatty acid glucose oxidation following high-carbohydrate meal (interaction term P < 0.05). accompanied impaired induction genes involved oxidative metabolism glucose MNC, phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) increased expression genes involved fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) fatty acid synthase (FASN) (P < 0.05). contrary, differences gene expression profiles lean obese subjects following high-fat meal. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial expression profiles genes involved glucose fatty acid metabolism MNC reflect differing metabolic flexibility phenotypes cohort lean obese individuals. differences metabolic flexibility lean obese elicited acute meal challenge rich carbohydrate fat.
