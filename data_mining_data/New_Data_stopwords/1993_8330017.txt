 brain European red mullet, 14.5 +/- 1.9% pyruvate kinase activity connected particulate fraction. enzyme form disappears 90 min hypoxia fish. pH-Dependences free bound pyruvate kinase forms similar. Km phosphoenolpyruvate adenosinediphosphate free enzyme 2-3-fold higher bound one. heated 45 degrees C, free pyruvate kinase gets inactivated, bound form is, succession, activated stabilized. possible role reversible phosphorylation regulation properties distribution pyruvate kinase cell discussed.
