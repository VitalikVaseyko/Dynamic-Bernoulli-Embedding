 lymphocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming adapt extracellular intracellular cues. Specifically, T-cell metabolism results ATP production, anabolism catabolism pathways support rapid cell growth proliferation, also differentiation effector functions, recently referred "immunometabolism". Quiescent naive cells rely oxidative phosphorylation whereas aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) occurs activated cells (effector CD4(+) CD8(+)). molecular mechanisms sense metabolic status influence T-cell function require metabolic checkpoints including sensors metabolic signals transducers (Myc, HIF-1alpha, AMPK mTOR). metabolic checkpoints represent novel therapeutic strategy immune modulation. Interestingly, many immunosuppressive drugs including mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin), calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine A) inhibitors de novo purine synthesis (6-mercaptopurine, mycophenolic acid methotrexate) provide examples modulating metabolic checkpoints regulate T-cell activation, differentiation function. Review highlight emerging concepts metabolic reprogramming T-cell responses discuss potential therapeutic interventions influence T-cell fate effector function.
