 glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, exhibits moderate affinity [3H]isatin binding (KD approximately 10 microM), inhibited ATP (IC50 25 microM) deprenyl (IC50 5 microM). Interaction pyruvate kinase isatin inhibition ATP deprenyl also confirmed using independent biosensor technique immobilized isatin analogue, aminoisatin. effect specificity enzyme, creatine phosphokinase, exhibit specific isatin-binding. suggested interaction pyruvate kinase isatin may reflect non-glycolytic functions enzyme.
