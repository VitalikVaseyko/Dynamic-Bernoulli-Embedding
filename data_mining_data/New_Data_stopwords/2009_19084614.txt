 complete family expressed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) genes tissues African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, consists four members. previous study [Terazawa, Y., Tokmakov, A., Shirouzu, M., Yokoyama, S., 2005. Molecular cloning expression analysis PDK family genes Xenopus laevis reveal oocyte-specific PDK isoform. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 338, 1798-1804] revealed expression patterns PDK genes differ greatly oocytes somatic tissues adult frog. present work, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis, demonstrate major transition oocyte-specific somatic tissue-specific xPDK expression pattern occurs late stages Xenopus embryogenesis mid-blastula transition (MBT). Also, show content mRNA xPDKo3, predominant PDK isoform oocytes eggs, increases 3-fold maturation. PDK family genes down-regulated oogenesis, thus lowest expression levels grown-up oocytes, matured eggs, early embryos. expression PDK genes increases several-fold embryogenesis following MBT. Analysis protein expression using antibody raised C-terminal xPDKo3 confirmed isoform-specific up-regulation xPDKo3 late maturation revealed cytoplasmic mitochondrial localization protein. Bioinformatics mass-spectrometric analyses allowed identification N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal peptide cleavage site xPDKo3 molecule.
