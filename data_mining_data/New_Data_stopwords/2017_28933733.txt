 pineal neuroindole melatonin exerts exceptional variety systemic functions. exerted specific membrane receptors type 1 type 2 (MT1 MT2) others mediated receptor-independent mechanisms. potential transport melatonin facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT/SLC2A) proposed prostate cancer cells. prostate cells particular metabolism changes tumor progression. first steps carcinogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation reactivated switch "Warburg effect" occurs advanced tumors metastatic stage. Here, investigated whether melatonin might change prostate cancer cell metabolism. so, (13)C stable isotope-resolved metabolomics androgen sensitive LNCaP insensitive PC-3 prostate cancer cells employed. addition metabolite (13)C-labeling, ATP/AMP levels, lactate dehydrogenase pentose phosphate pathway activity measured. Melatonin reduces lactate labeling androgen-sensitive cells also lowers (13)C-labeling tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites ATP production. addition, melatonin reduces lactate (13)C-labeling androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells. Results demonstrated melatonin limits glycolysis well tricarboxylic acid cycle pentose phosphate pathway prostate cancer cells, suggesting reduction glucose uptake major target indole tumor type.
