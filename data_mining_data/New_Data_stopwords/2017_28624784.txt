 One remarkable features cancer cells aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known "Warburg Effect", cells rely preferentially glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) main energy source even presence high oxygen tension. Cells dysfunctional mitochondria unable generate sufficient ATP mitochondrial OXPHOS, forced rely glycolysis ATP generation. report results prostate cancer cell line mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) gene knockout. discovered MPC1 gene knockout cells revealed metabolism reprogramming aerobic glycolysis reduced ATP production, cells became migratory resistant chemotherapy radiotherapy. addition, MPC1 knockout cells expressed significantly higher levels stemness markers Nanog, Hif1alpha, Notch1, CD44 ALDH. verify correlation MPC gene function cell stemness/metabolic reprogramming, MPC inhibitor UK5099 applied two ovarian cancer cell lines similar results obtained. Taken together, results reveal functional MPC may determine fate metabolic program stemness status cancer cells vitro.
