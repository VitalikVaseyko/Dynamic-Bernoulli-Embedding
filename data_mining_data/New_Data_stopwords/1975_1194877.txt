 H. diminuta different stages development contained many five pyruvate kinase isozymes. Four unusually sensitive allosteric activation fructose-1,6-P2. One isozyme occurred adults near-adults insensitive relatively low Km. inhibited ATP Ca2+, none alanine, pH optimum unaffected fructose-1,6-P2. five isozymes present gravid reproductively active proglottids. Two occurred eight days growth rat intestine, three four days. three also present immature, anterior proglottids adult parasites. Hexacanth larvae gravid proglottids, well cysticercoids developing larvae Tenebrio molitor, possessed two isozymes. inferred information tissue concentrations ADP, ATP, phosphoenolypyruvate (PEP) K0.5S Km competition pyruvate kinase PEP carboxykinase probably controlled fructose-1,6-P2 concentrations. Since H. diminuta obligatory fermenter gluconeogenesis minimal, probable function L-type pyruvate kinases control specific composition lactic, acetic succinic acid mixtures excreted different stages development.
