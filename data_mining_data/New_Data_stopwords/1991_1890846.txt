 earlier graph theoretical model metabolic gene-expression networks modified extended include effect electrical potentials binding constants, representation uncatalyzed processes, treatment parallel reactions catalyzed single enzyme. Formal operations graph, facilitated set standardized guidelines, identify feedback signals network rank according influence. technique applied model glycolysis ascites tumor cells absence presence 12.5 mM exogenous glucose. Feedback regulation widely distributed mostly due binding adenine nucleotide cofactors enzymes network. major changes feedback regulation adding glucose relief inhibition hexokinase phosphofructokinase activation pyruvate kinase. conclude regulation tumor cell glycolysis restricted hexokinase (Na+,K+)-ATPase previously suggested others.
