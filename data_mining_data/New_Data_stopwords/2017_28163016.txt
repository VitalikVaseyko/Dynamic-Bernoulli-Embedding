 Non-enzymatic protein modification driven thioester reactivity thought play major role establishment cellular lysine acylation. However, specific protein targets process largely unknown. report experimental strategy investigate non-enzymatic acylation cells. Specifically, develop chemoproteomic method separates thioester reactivity enzymatic utilization, allowing selective enrichment non-enzymatic acylation targets. Applying method cancer cell lines identifies numerous candidate targets non-enzymatic acylation, including several enzymes lower glycolysis. Functional studies highlight malonyl-CoA reactive thioester metabolite modify inhibit glycolytic enzyme activity. Finally, show synthetic thioesters used novel reagents probe non-enzymatic acylation living cells. studies provide new insights targets drivers non-enzymatic acylation, demonstrate utility reactivity-based methods experimentally investigate phenomenon biology disease.
