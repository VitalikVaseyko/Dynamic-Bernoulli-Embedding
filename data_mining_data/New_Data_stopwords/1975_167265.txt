 activities jejunal carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes show adaptive drugs, sex hormones. learn whether insulin, tolbutamide, glucagon effects enzymes, performed serial peroral jejunal biopsies normal young men obese patients, treatment agents. Jejunal mucosa assayed glycolytic enzyme activities, pyruvate kinase (PK), hexokinase (HK), fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase (FDPA), nonglycolytic enzyme activity, fructose diphosphatase (FDPase). Insulin significantly increased activity jejunal PK (+48% change control) HK (+6%), decreased activity FDPase (-36%),and effect FDPA. Glucagon opposite effects; activity PK decreased (-33%) FDPase increased (+50%). Tolbutamide significantly increased activities PK (+47%), HK (+14%), FDPA (+7%), decreased activities FDPase (-36%). results tolbutamide glycolytic enzyme activities independent endogenous insulin. data support concept jejunal carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes man respond hormones drugs similar responses observed rat liver. important gives us means studying actions hormones directly human tissue.
