 Cervical cancer still one leading causes cancer deaths women worldwide, especially developing countries. major metabolic character cancer cells consume large quantities glucose derive energy glycolysis even presence adequate oxygen, called Warburg effect exaggerated hypoxia. high risk subtype HPV16 early oncoprotein E6 contributes host cell immortalization transformation interacting number cellular factors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), ubiquitously expressed transcriptional regulator involved induction numerous genes associated angiogenesis tumor growth, highly increased HPV E6. HIF-1alpha best-known target von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) E3 ligase degradation. present work, found HPV16 E6 promotes hypoxia induced Warburg effect hindering association HIF-1alpha VHL. disassociation attenuates VHL-mediated HIF-1alpha ubiquitination causes HIF-1alpha accumulation. results suggest oncoprotein E6 plays major role regulation Warburg effect valuable therapeutic target HPV-related cancer.
