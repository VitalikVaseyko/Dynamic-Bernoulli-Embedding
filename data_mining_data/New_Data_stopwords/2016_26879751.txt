 Pyruvate kinase catalyzes final step glycolysis allosterically regulated control flux pathway. Two models proposed explain Escherichia coli pyruvate kinase type 1 allosterically regulated: "domain rotation model" suggests domains within monomer monomers within tetramer reorient respect one another; "rigid body reorientation model" proposes reorientation monomers within tetramer causing rigidification active site. test hypotheses elucidate conformational dynamic changes drive allostery, performed time-resolved electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies followed mutagenic analysis test activation mechanism. Global exchange experiments, supported thermostability studies, demonstrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate binding allosteric domain causes shift toward globally dynamic ensemble conformations. Mapping deuterium exchange peptides within enzyme highlight site-specific regions altered conformational dynamics, many increase conformational flexibility. Based upon mutagenic studies, propose allosteric mechanism whereby binding fructose 1,6-bisphosphate destabilizes alpha-helix bridges allosteric active site domains within monomeric unit. destabilizes beta-strands within (beta/alpha)8-barrel domain linked active site loops responsible substrate binding. data consistent domain rotation model inconsistent rigid body reorientation model given increased flexibility interdomain interface, first time explain fructose 1,6-bisphosphate affects active site.
