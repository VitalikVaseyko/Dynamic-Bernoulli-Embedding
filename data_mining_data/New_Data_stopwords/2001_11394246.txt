 present study investigated possibility exercise-induced increases plasma levels interleukin (IL)-6 associated plasma lactate levels. Patients mitochondrial myopathy (MM) characterised high levels plasma lactate. study, seven patients MM underwent ergometer cycle test 25 min without treatment. treated dichloroacetate (DCA) 15 days. DCA inhibits pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase, thereby increasing activity pyruvate-dehydrogenase complex. exercise test repeated last day treatment. DCA lowered plasma lactate increased plasma IL-6 concentrations rest. IL-6 increased response exercise DCA treatment. Furthermore, plasma IL-6 negatively correlated plasma lactate rest (r = -0.786, P = 0.05). Given IL-6 cytokine growth-promoting potential, results study suggest high lactate production contributes decreased muscle function observed MM patients inhibiting production IL-6.
