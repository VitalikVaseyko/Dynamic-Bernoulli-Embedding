 naturally occurring antioxidant lipoic acid (LA) first described essential cofactor conversion pyruvate Acetyl-CoA, critical step respiration. LA recognized compound many biological functions. Along reduced form dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), LA reduces recycles cellular antioxidants glutathione, chelates zinc, copper transition metal ions addition heavy metals. LA also act scavenger reactive oxygen nitrogen species. acting insulin mimetic agent, LA stimulates glucose uptake many different cell types also modulate insulin signaling. p38 ERK MAP kinase pathways, AKT NFkappaB regulated LA. addition, LA activates prostaglandin EP2 EP4 receptors stimulate production small molecule cyclic adenosine 5' monophosphate (cAMP). diverse actions suggest LA may therapeutically effective treating oxidative stress associated diseases. review discusses known biochemical properties LA, antioxidant properties, ability modulate signal transduction pathways, recent progress made utilization LA therapeutic alternative multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease diabetic neuropathy.
