 Leptin crucial energy metabolism, including muscle regulation. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) orchestrates energy metabolism tightly controlled post-translational covalent modifications phosphorylation acetylation. aimed knowledge PGC1alpha control leptin (at physiological levels) muscle cells time-sequentially analysing activation AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK) Akt (Protein kinase B)--all known phosphorylate PGC1alpha involved regulation acetylation status--in C2C12 myotubes placed high-glucose serum-free medium. also studied protein levels PGC1alpha, Sirtuin 1, adiponectin, COX IV, mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). main findings suggest important role leptin regulating AMPK Akt phosphorylation, Mfn2 induction PGC1alpha acetylation status, novelty latter transitorily increased response leptin, effect dependent, least part, AMPK regulation. post-translational reversible changes PGC1alpha response leptin, especially increase acetylation status, may related physiological role hormone modulating muscle cell response physiological/nutritional status.
