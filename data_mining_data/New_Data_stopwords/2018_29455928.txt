 Aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) facilitates tumor growth, drugs targeting aerobic glycolysis developed. However, Warburg effect directly regulated largely unknown. show transcription factor SIX1 directly increases expression many glycolytic genes, promoting Warburg effect tumor growth vitro vivo. SIX1 regulates glycolysis HBO1 AIB1 histone acetyltransferases. Cancer-related SIX1 mutation increases ability promote aerobic glycolysis tumor growth. SIX1 glycolytic function directly repressed microRNA-548a-3p, downregulated, inversely correlates SIX1, good predictor prognosis breast cancer patients. Thus, microRNA-548a-3p/SIX1 axis strongly links aerobic glycolysis carcinogenesis may become promising cancer therapeutic target.
