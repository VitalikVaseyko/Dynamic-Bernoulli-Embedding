 serum-free, hormone-supplemented medium (SFHM) maintaining neonatal rat heart cells culture developed laboratory (Mohamed et al., 1983). Morphological assessment heart cells grown SFHM show similar commonly used serum-supplemented media. quantitatively compare cell behavior SFHM serum-supplemented media, activities ten regulatory enzymes represent four metabolic pathways studied heart cells cultured SFHM. enzyme activities measured included hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, NAD+-linked sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADH-cytochrome c reductase, succinic cytochrome c reductase. Rat heart cells maintained culture SFHM qualitatively quantitatively similar maintained serum-supplemented medium also provide suitable model system metabolic studies neonatal cardiac tissue several reasons: 1) many enzyme activities may represent dedifferentiation elevated serum; 2) NAD-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity cells maintained SFHM similar vivo activity; 3) cells beat near vivo frequency maintained 3 months SFHM; 4) SFHM chemically defined thus completely manipulated investigator. effects three concentrations hydrocortisone (HC) (5,000 ng/ml, 50 micrograms/ml, 0 ng/ml) heart cells cultured SFHM supported previous conclusion function (beating) growth (protein accumulation) inversely related cultured neonatal rat heart cells.
