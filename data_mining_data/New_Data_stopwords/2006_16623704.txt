 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) key regulatory enzyme involved switching energy source glucose fatty acids response physiological conditions. Transcription PDK4 gene activated fasting administration PPARalpha ligand tissue-specific manner. Here, show two mechanisms independent, ERRalpha directly involved PPARalpha-independent transcriptional activation PDK4 gene PGC-1alpha specific partner. conclusion based following evidence. First, detailed mutation analyses cloned PDK4 gene promoter sequence identified possible ERRalpha-binding motif PGC-1alpha responsive element. Second, overexpression ERRalpha cotransfection enhanced, knockout shRNAs diminished, PGC-1alpha-dependent activation. Third, specific binding ERRalpha identified PGC-1alpha responsive sequence confirmed electrophoresis mobility shift assay. Finally, cell-type-specific responsiveness PGC-1alpha observed could explained differences expression levels ERRalpha, however, ectopic expression ERRalpha poorly responsive cells restore PGC-1alpha responsiveness, indicating ERRalpha necessary, sufficient response.
