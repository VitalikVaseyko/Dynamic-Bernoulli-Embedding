 selenium (Se) essential micronutrient humans, epidemiological studies raised concern supranutritional Se intake may increase risk developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). aimed determine impact Se dose source frequently ingested humans markers insulin sensitivity signalling. Male pigs fed either Se-adequate (0.17 mg Se/kg) Se-supranutritional (0.50 mg Se/kg; high-Se) diet. 16 weeks intervention, fasting plasma insulin cholesterol levels non-significantly increased high-Se pigs, whereas fasting glucose concentrations differ two groups. skeletal muscle high-Se pigs, glutathione peroxidase activity increased, gene expression forkhead box O1 transcription factor peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha increased gene expression glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase decreased. visceral adipose tissue high-Se pigs, mRNA levels sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 increased, phosphorylation Akt, AMP-activated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases affected. conclusion, dietary Se oversupply may affect expression activity proteins involved energy metabolism major insulin target tissues, though probably sufficient induce diabetes.
