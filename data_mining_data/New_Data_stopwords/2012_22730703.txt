 study aimed assessing total enzyme activity profile breast cancer dysplasia human material. addition, validity data evaluated aspect improving diagnostics. Lactate dehydrogenase activity, well profile isoenzymes, pyruvate kinase hexokinase, measured. study included 60 samples breast cancer, 20 benign breast tumours 40 1st 2nd degree dysplasia breast. samples collected patients operated Institute Oncology Faculty Medicine Sremska Kamenica. Lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes separated vertical polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis according slightly modified Brewer Ashworth's method. activity tested enzymes measured conditions linear kinetics function time enzyme concentration. Lactate dehydrogenase-5 found 88% analyzed breast cancer samples, whereas detected breast dysplasia. Pyruvate kinase (4.-isoenzyme) 50 times higher activity hexokinase 3 times higher breast cancer breast dysplasia. Lactate dehydrogenase-5 pyruvate kinase (4.-isoenzyme) particularly important reliable markers malignity. results obtained quantitative qualitative changes enzyme activity used improve diagnostics early diagnostics malignant breast neoplasm.
