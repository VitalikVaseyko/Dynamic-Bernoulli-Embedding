 comparing protein profiles nasopharyngeal carcinoma HONE1 cells transformed nasopharyngeal epithelial NP 69 cells, several clusters differentially expressed proteins identified. increased expression cytokeratin 8 (CK8) pyruvate kinase M2 common feature four NPC cell lines compared two transformed epithelial cell lines. Suppression CK8 associated sensitivity cisplatin HONE1 cells; overexpression CK8 provided resistance cisplatin-mediated apoptosis; protection occurred enhanced phosphorylation c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK). findings implicate underlying molecular mechanism CK8 required cisplatin resistance.
