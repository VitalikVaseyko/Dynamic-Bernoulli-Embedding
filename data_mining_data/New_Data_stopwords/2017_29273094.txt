 BACKGROUND: phenotypic severity congenital muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (MDDG) syndromes associated aberrant glycosylation alpha-dystroglycan ranges severe Walker-Warburg syndrome muscle-eye-brain disease mild, late-onset, isolated limb-girdle muscular dystrophy without neural involvement. However, muscular dystrophy invariably found across spectrum MDDG patients. METHODS: Using linkage mapping whole-exome sequencing two families unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder, identified homozygous compound heterozygous mutations B3GALNT2. RESULTS: first family comprises two brothers Dutch non-consanguineous parents presenting mild ID behavioral problems. Immunohistochemical analysis muscle biopsy revealed significant aberrations, line absence muscular phenotype affected siblings. second family includes five affected individuals Iranian consanguineous kindred mild-to-moderate intellectual disability (ID) epilepsy without notable neuroimaging, muscle, eye abnormalities. Complementation assays compound heterozygous mutations identified two brothers comparable effect O-glycosylation alpha-dystroglycan previously reported mutations associated severe muscular phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: conclusion, show mutations B3GALNT2 give rise novel MDDG syndrome presentation, characterized ID associated variably seizure, without apparent muscular involvement. Importantly, B3GALNT2 activity fully correlate severity phenotype assessed complementation assay.
