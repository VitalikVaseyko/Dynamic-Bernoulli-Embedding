 ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Anemone rivularis Buch.-Ham. ex DC. (Ranunculaceae) used traditional remedy treatment inflammation cancer. However, report demonstrating experimental evidence anti-tumor action A. rivularis. AIM STUDY: Warburg's effect, preference aerobic glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) even oxygen rich condition, focused one major characteristics malignant tumor. Thus, investigated effect A. rivularis Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinases (PDHKs), major molecular targets reducing aerobic glycolysis. MATERIALS METHODS: ethanol extract whole plant A. rivularis (ARE), fingerprinted high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), applied vitro cell-based PDHK activity assays. effect cell viabilities several tumor cells estimated MTT assay. expression phosphor-PDH, PDH PDHK1 measured Western blot analysis. production reactive oxygen species (ROS) apoptosis measured fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, using 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA) Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. Mitochondrial membrane potential examined tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) staining. vivo anti-tumor efficacy estimated means tumor volume weight using allograft injection murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells dorsa C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: inhibited viabilities several cancer cells, including MDA-MB321, K562, HT29, Hep3B, DLD-1, LLC. suppressed PDHK activity vitro kinase assay, also inhibited aerobic glycolysis reducing phosphorylation PDHA human DLD-1 colon cancer murine LLC cells. expression PDHK1, major isoform PDHKs cancer, affected treatment. Moreover, increased ROS production mitochondrial damage. addition, suppressed vitro tumor growth mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. growth rates allograft LLC cells also reduced treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Here, firstly report inhibits PDHK activity growth tumor vitro vivo experiments. Therefore, suggest potential candidate developing anti-cancer drugs.
