 Dysregulated metabolism emerging hallmark cancer, abundant interest developing therapies selectively target aberrant metabolic phenotypes. Sitting decision-point mitochondrial carbohydrate oxidation aerobic glycolysis (i.e., 'Warburg effect'), synthesis consumption pyruvate tightly controlled often differentially regulated cancer cells. review examines recent efforts toward understanding targeting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism, addresses successes, pitfalls, significant challenges metabolic therapy date.
