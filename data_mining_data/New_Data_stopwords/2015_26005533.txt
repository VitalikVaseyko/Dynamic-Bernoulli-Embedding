 Potent monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitors (MCT1) developed based alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid template. Structure-activity relationship studies demonstrate introduction p-N, N-dialkyl/diaryl, o-methoxy groups cyanocinnamic acid maximal MCT1 inhibitory activity. Systemic toxicity studies healthy ICR mice potent MCT1 inhibitors indicate normal body weight gains treated animals. vivo tumor growth inhibition studies colorectal adenocarcinoma (WiDr cell line) nude mice xenograft models establish compound 27 exhibits single agent activity inhibiting tumor growth.
