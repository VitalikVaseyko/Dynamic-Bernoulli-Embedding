 order rationally manipulate cellular metabolism Escherichia coli D: -lactate production, single-gene multiple-gene deletions mutations acetate kinase (ackA), phosphotransacetylase (pta), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (pps), pyruvate formate lyase (pflB), FAD-binding D-lactate dehydrogenase (dld), pyruvate oxidase (poxB), alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE), fumarate reductase (frdA) tested effects two-phase fermentations (aerobic growth oxygen-limited production). Lactate yield productivity could improved single-gene deletions ackA, pta, pflB, dld, poxB, frdA wild type E. coli strain unfavorably affected deletions pps adhE. However, fermentation experiments multiple-gene mutant strains showed deletion pps addition ackA-pta deletions effect lactate production, whereas additional deletion adhE E. coli B0013-050 (ackA-pta pps pflB dld poxB) increased lactate yield. Deletion eight genes E. coli B0013 produce B0013-070 (ackA-pta pps pflB dld poxB adhE frdA) increased lactate yield productivity twofold reduced yields acetate, succinate, formate, ethanol 95, 89, 100, 93%, respectively. tested bioreactor, E. coli B0013-070 produced 125 g/l D-lactate increased oxygen-limited lactate productivity 0.61 g/g h (2.1-fold greater E. coli B0013). kinetic properties D-lactate production among highest reported results revealed genetic manipulations improved D-lactate production E. coli.
