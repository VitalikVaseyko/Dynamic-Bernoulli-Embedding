 pyruvate dehydrogenase branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes animal mitochondria inactivated phosphorylation serine residues, reactivated dephosphorylation. addition, phosphorylated branched-chain complex reactivated, apparently without dephosphorylation, protein protein-associated factor present liver kidney mitochondria heart skeletal muscle mitochondria. Interconversion branched-chain complex may adjust degradation branched-chain amino acids different tissues response supply. Phosphorylation inhibited branched-chain ketoacids, ADP TPP. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex almost totally inactivated (99%) starvation diabetes, kinase reactions accelerated products fatty acid oxidation protein protein-associated factor induced starvation diabetes. three sites phosphorylation, sites 1 2 inactivating. Site 1 phosphorylation accounts 98% inactivation except dephosphorylation contribution falls 93%. Sites 2 3 fully phosphorylated complex fully inactivated (starvation, diabetes). Phosphorylation sites 2 3 inhibits reactivation phosphatase. phosphatase reaction activated Ca2+ (which may mediate effects muscle work) possibly uncharacterized factors mediating insulin action adipocytes.
