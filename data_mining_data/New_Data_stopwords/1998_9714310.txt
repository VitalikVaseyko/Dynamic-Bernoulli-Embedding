 Englitazone (CP 68,722, Pfizer) member family drugs known thiazolidinediones. One member family, troglitazone (Rezulin), currently utilized treatment Type 2 diabetes. Previous studies focused ability englitazone increase insulin sensitivity various tissues. However, little information available regarding direct effect englitazone hepatic glucose metabolism absence insulin. Therefore, following studies conducted comparatively evaluate effect englitazone glyburide (a representative sulfonylurea) gluconeogenesis glycolysis various substrates isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL). isolated perfused rat livers 24-hr fasted rats infused lactate (2 mM), englitazone (6.25 50 microM) produced concentration-dependent decrease (32-93%) hepatic gluconeogenesis. dihydroxyacetone (1 mM) fructose (1 mM) used metabolic substrates, englitazone inhibited gluconeogenesis 31 15%, respectively, increasing glycolysis 42 50%. Similar effects gluconeogenesis glycolysis observed glyburide, even though effects glyburide acutely evident, reversible, greater magnitude. data suggest alterations hepatic glucose production may contribute decrease plasma glucose concentrations observed individuals treated englitazone glyburide. alterations may include effects several regulatory enzymes (e.g. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), warrant investigation.
