 1. Rats fed diets containing orotic acid dietary fibers induce alteration lipid metabolism cytoplasmic enzyme activities livers. Concentrations blood glucose, serum insulin free fatty acids (FFA) measured. 2. CP (cellulose + orotic acid) group compared basal (cellulose - orotic acid) CBH (corn bran hemicellulose + cellulose + orotic acid) groups, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase ATP citrate lyase activities FFA concentration decreased according lipid accumulation livers. 3. CBH group, glycerokinase activity higher basal group.
