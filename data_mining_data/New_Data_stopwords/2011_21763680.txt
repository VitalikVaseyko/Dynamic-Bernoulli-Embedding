 switch cellular metabolism mitochondrial respiration glycolysis hallmark cancer cells associated tumor malignancy. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) PDK3 participate metabolic switch cancer cells; however, medical significance PDK1 PDK3 cancer progression known. Here, assessed expression profiles PDK1 PDK3 colorectal cancer. Western blot analysis (n = 74) demonstrated PDK3 markedly increased colon cancer compared adjacent normal tissues, whereas PDK1 decreased cancer cells. addition, PDK3 expression positively correlated hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) cancer cells. analysis using immunohistochemical staining revealed PDK3 levels positively associated severity cancer negatively associated disease-free survival. vitro studies using several colon cancer cell lines showed PDK3 expression controlled HIF-1alpha contributed hypoxia-induced increased drug resistance, perhaps explaining patients PDK3 overexpression greater incidence treatment failure. Taken together, findings suggest PDK3 plays important role metabolic switch drug resistance colon cancer potentially novel target cancer therapy.
