 Heterogeneity ADP diffusion regulation respiration studied permeabilized cardiomyocytes cardiac fibers situ silico. Regular arrangement mitochondria cells altered short-time treatment trypsin visualized confocal microscopy. Manipulation matrix volumes changing K(+) sucrose concentrations affect affinity ADP either isolated heart mitochondria skinned fibers. Pyruvate kinase (PK)-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) used trap ADP generated Ca,MgATPase reactions. Inhibition respiration PK-PEP increased 2-3 times disorganization regular mitochondrial arrangement cells. ADP produced locally mitochondrial creatine kinase reaction accessible PK-PEP intact permeabilized fibers, part released mitochondria short proteolysis due increased permeability outer mitochondrial membrane. silico studies show mathematical modeling results explained heterogeneity ADP diffusion due restrictions outer mitochondrial membrane close areas, changed proteolysis.
