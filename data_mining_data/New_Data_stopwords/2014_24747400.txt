 Despite introduction antiproliferative drug-eluting stents, coronary heart disease remains leading cause death United States. In-stent restenosis bypass graft failure characterized excessive smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation concomitant myointima formation luminal obliteration. show development myointimal hyperplasia human arteries, SMCs show hyperpolarization mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) acquire temporary state high proliferative rate resistance apoptosis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDK2) identified key regulatory protein, activation proved necessary relevant myointima formation. Pharmacologic PDK2 blockade dichloroacetate lentiviral PDK2 knockdown prevented DeltaPsim hyperpolarization, facilitated apoptosis reduced myointima formation injured human mammary coronary arteries, rat aortas, rabbit iliac arteries swine (pig) coronary arteries. contrast several commonly used antiproliferative drugs, dichloroacetate prevent vessel re-endothelialization. Targeting myointimal DeltaPsim alleviating apoptosis resistance novel strategy prevention proliferative vascular diseases.
