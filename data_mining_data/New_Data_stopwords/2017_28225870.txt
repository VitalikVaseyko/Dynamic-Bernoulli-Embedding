 study undertaken clarify role mechanism pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDK2) chondrogenic differentiation mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs isolated femurs tibias Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 300-400 g (5 females 5 males). Overexpression knockdown PDK2 transfected MSCs cell viability, adhesion migration assessed. Additionally, roles aberrant PDK2 chondrogenesis markers SRY-related high mobility group-box 6 (Sox6), type IotaIota procollagen gene (COL2A1), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), aggrecan (AGC1), type IotaX procollagen gene (COL9A2) collagen type 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1) measured quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). expressions c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) measured. Overexpressing PDK2 promoted cell viability, adhesion inhibited cell migration MSCs (all P<0.05). qRT-PCR assay showed potent increase mRNA expressions chondrogenesis markers response overexpressing PDK2 (P<0.01 P<0.05). PDK2 overexpression also induced significant accumulation mRNA protein expressions JNK, p38MAPK ERK MSCs compared control (P<0.01 P<0.05). Meanwhile, silencing PDK2 exerted opposite effects MSCs. study shows preliminary positive role potential mechanisms PDK2 chondrogenic differentiation MSCs. lays theoretical groundwork uncovering functions PDK2 provides promising basis repairing cartilage lesions osteoarthritis.
