 Nutritional myopathy induced rats lambs feeding diets low selenium. distribution 45Ca, administered 45CaCl2, examined firstly autoradiography, secondly measuring excretion 45Ca urine faeces. Autoradiographs skeletal muscle unsupplemented animals showed radioactivity discrete muscle fibres stage abnormalities apparent using conventional staining techniques. Similar retention 45Ca found tubules kidneys selenium-deficient rats. Total excretion urine faeces lambs, examined 48 h intravenous administration 45CaCl2, showed normal animals 18-6% dose excreted, whereas dystrophic lambs 12-0% lost. difference significant 2% level. respiratory rates isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria, measured polarographically presence glutamate pyruvate substrates, low dystrophic rats. Respiratory control indices 1-0 preparations supplemented rats 1-0. differences respiratory rates significant 1% level. major conclusion drawn results experiments one first effects sleenium deficiency visualized abnormal retention calcium individual muscle fibres.
