 use regular yeast (RY) selenium-enriched yeast (SEY) dietary supplement interest Nutritional Prevention Cancer (NPC) trial revealed SEY RY decreased incidence prostate cancer (PC). Using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) approach, performed proteomic analysis RY SEY identify proteins differentially expressed result selenium enrichment. 2D-DIGE revealed 96 candidate protein spots differentially expressed (p</=0.05) SEY RY. 96 spots selected, sequenced LC/MS/MS 37 proteins unequivocally identified. 37 identified proteins verified ProteinProphet software mapped existing Gene Ontology categories. Furthermore, expression profile 5 proteins validated putative roles carcinogenesis process, antibodies human forms proteins available commercially verified western analysis. study provides evidence first time SEY contains higher levels Pyruvate Kinase, HSP70, Elongation factor 2 lower levels Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A-2 Triosephosphate Isomerase found RY.
