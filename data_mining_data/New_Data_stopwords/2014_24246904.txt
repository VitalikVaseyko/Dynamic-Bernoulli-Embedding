 Ethyl pyruvate (EP) shown anti-inflammatory effects confer protective effects various pathological conditions. example, EP inhibits secretion high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), known released activated dying cells aggravate inflammatory pathways. present study, investigated whether EP reduces HMGB1 phosphorylation release ischemic brain cultured microglia. postischemic brains (60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)), HMGB1 released extracellularly, generating dual peaks cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around 1 7 days ischemic insult, probably generated damaged neurons activated inflammatory cells, respectively. showed treatment EP 30 min post-MCAO (5 mg/kg, i.v.), shown confer robust neuroprotective effect postischemic brain, reduced peaks. addition, delayed EP treatment 4 days post-MCAO reduced HMGB1 accumulation CSF 7 day post-MCAO absence accompanying amelioration ischemic brain damage, indicating suppression HMGB1 release direct effect. also found EP markedly suppressed LPS-induced nuclear translocations protein kinase C alpha calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV, HMGB1 phosphorylation, subsequent secretion HMGB1 induced LPS BV2 cells EP-mediated above-mentioned effects also independent cell death survival. results indicate EP inhibits HMGB1 phosphorylation release activated microglia, might responsible EP-mediated suppression HMGB1 release postischemic brain.
