 Vesiculated fragments chicken skeletal muscle transverse tubule (TT) membranes analyzed content loosely associated integral membrane proteins. particular interest identification magnesium-stimulated ATPase (Mg-ATPase), characteristically located native isolated TT vesicles chicken skeletal muscle [R. A. Sabbadini V. R. Okamoto (1983) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 223, 107-119]. number proteins found vesicular TT preparations found extractable mild Triton-X100 treatment identified aldolase, enolase, creatine kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase. Approximately 60% TT-associated protein extracted Triton, resulting twofold enrichment Mg-ATPase. Concommitantly, one core integral membrane protein possessing Mr 102,000 enriched, suggesting responsible Mg-ATPase activity present chicken skeletal muscle TT membranes.
