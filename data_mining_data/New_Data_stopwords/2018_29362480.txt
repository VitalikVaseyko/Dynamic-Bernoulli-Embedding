 hallmark cancer, Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) confers selective advantage survival proliferation cancer cells. Due frequent aberration upstream proto-oncogenes tumor suppressors, hyperactive mammalian/mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) potent inducer Warburg effect. Here, report overexpression glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglyceric acid mutase-1 (PGAM1), critical oncogenic mTOR-mediated Warburg effect. mTOR stimulated PGAM1 expression hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha-mediated transcriptional activation. Blockage PGAM1 suppressed mTOR-dependent glycolysis, cell proliferation, tumorigenesis. PGAM1 expression mTOR activity positively correlated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues PGAM1 abundance adverse predictor patient survival. PGAM1 thus downstream effector mTOR signaling pathway mTOR-PGAM1 signaling cascade may contribute development Warburg effect observed cancer. consider PGAM1 novel prognostic biomarker NSCLC therapeutic target cancer.
