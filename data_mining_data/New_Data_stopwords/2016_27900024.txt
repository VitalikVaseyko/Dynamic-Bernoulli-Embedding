 present study aimed systematically analyze alterations expression mitochondrial-associated proteins human bladder cancer T24 cells co-cultured tumor-associated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), investigate characteristics bladder cancer cell energy metabolism. present study used following techniques: co-culture system T24 cells HUVECs constructed using microfluidic chip 3D co-culture system; concentration lactic acid medium cells determined using automatic microplate reader; qualitative analysis mitochondria-associated protein expression performed immunofluorescent staining; quantitative analysis mitochondrial-associated protein expression conducted using western blotting. present results revealed control groups (monoculture T24 cells HUVECs), mitochondrial-associated protein fluorescence intensity increased HUVECs compared T24 cells. fluorescence intensity mitochondrial-associated proteins HUVEC control group increased compared HUVECs experimental co-culture group. T24 cells, protein fluorescence intensity increased experimental co-culture group compared control group. addition, expression mitochondria-associated proteins increased HUVECs compared T24 cells control groups, T24 cells experimental co-culture group increased expression compared HUVECs experimental group (P<0.05). T24 cells, expression mitochondrial-associated proteins increased experimental group compared control group, contrasting results observed HUVECs (P<0.05). Determination lactic acid concentration demonstrated lactic acid concentration highest experimental co-culture group, followed T24 control group HUVEC control group. conclusion, present study demonstrated energy metabolism bladder tumor cells parallel 'Warburg effect', since even sufficient oxygen conditions tumor cells still undergo glycolysis. Additionally, bladder tumor cells efficient oxidative phosphorylation process, wherein tumor cells promote glycolysis adjacent interstitial cells, thereby causing increased formation nutritional precursors. high-energy metabolites transferred adjacent tumor cells specified direction enter Krebs Cycle. Ultimately, oxidative phosphorylation increases, sufficient ATP produced.
