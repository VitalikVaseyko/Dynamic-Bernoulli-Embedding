 Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative disorder characterized extracellular deposition brain amyloid beta-peptide (A beta), presumed play pathogenic role. However, precise molecular mechanisms neurotoxicity fully understood. Recent studies suggested may exert toxic effect via activation transcription factors. investigated beta-responsive genes human preneuron NT2 cells, early stages beta (25-35) exposure, RNA differential display. beta induced expression (i) growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene (gadd45) implicated DNA excision-repair process; (ii) stress-signaling kinase gene encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1); (iii) new growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene, CYR61, product functions extracellular matrix signaling molecule; (iv) immediate-early genes, c-jun c-fos; (v) gene encoding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF); (vi) gene encoding constituent mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase-binding protein (E3-BP); (vii) unidentified human gene (KIAA0099). beta activates also respresses genes: (i) gene encoding "hinge" protein, subunit mitochondrial cytochrome-c reductase (ii) SRp55 gene encoding splicing factor involved constitutive pre-mRNA splicing alternative splice site selection. results underscored beta-responsive genes play key roles response (damage/recovery) neuron cells beta exposure. particular, strong upregulation gadd45, indicating DNA damage, detected early beta cytotoxicity. suggests DNA strand breaks occurred rapidly cells exposed beta, may critical event beta neurotoxicity.
