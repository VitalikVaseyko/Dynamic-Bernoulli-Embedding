 mammalian cells, growing body evidence indicates relationship cellular redox balance tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signalling. phosphorylative cascade activated extracellular signals inhibited reducing conditions stimulated oxidative stress, particular level mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. mussel Mytilus typically shows variations antioxidant defence systems decreases glutathione content response natural contaminant environmental stressors. isolated mussel digestive gland cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF) insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) recently demonstrated activate tyrosine kinase receptors leading multiple responses; among these, stimulation key glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK). present study investigates possible relationship tyrosine kinase-mediated metabolic effects growth factors cellular redox balance mussel cells. results demonstrate effects growth factors glycolytic enzymes abolished cell pretreatment antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). hand, cells glutathione content synthesis lowered either vitro (by cell pretreatment buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)), vivo (by mussel exposure Cu(2+)) metabolic effects growth factors unaffected. Moreover, results show that, control glutathione-depleted cells, growth factors also regulate level glutathione apparently modulating, via phosphorylative mechanisms involving MAPK activation, activity gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), rate limiting enzyme GSH biosynthesis. Overall, study extends hypothesis cell signalling intimately related redox balance marine invertebrate cells.
