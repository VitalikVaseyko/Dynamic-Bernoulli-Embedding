 molecular mechanisms couple glycolysis cancer drug resistance remain unclear. identify ATP-binding motif within NADPH oxidase isoform, NOX4, show ATP directly binds negatively regulates NOX4 activity. find NOX4 localizes inner mitochondria membrane subcellular redistribution ATP levels mitochondria act allosteric switch activate NOX4. provide evidence NOX4-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibits P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF)-dependent acetylation lysosomal degradation pyruvate kinase-M2 isoform (PKM2). Finally, show NOX4 silencing, PKM2, sensitizes cultured ex vivo freshly isolated human-renal carcinoma cells drug-induced cell death xenograft models ex vivo cultures. findings highlight yet unidentified insights molecular events driving cancer evasive resistance suggest modulation ATP levels together cytotoxic drugs could overcome drug-resistance glycolytic cancers.
