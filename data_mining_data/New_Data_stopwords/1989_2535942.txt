 exposure fibrinogen receptors early event agonist-induced platelet activation. Previous measurements fibrinogen binding aggregation platelet-rich plasma washed platelets failed define whether initial response epinephrine results solely direct effect agonist. address problem, measured fibrinogen receptor exposure platelets whole blood using flow cytometry fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody specific activated fibrinogen receptor (FITC-PAC1). also measured platelet-bound fibrinogen antifibrinogen monoclonal antibody (FITC-9F9) well platelet aggregation whole blood. blood anticoagulated citrate presence cyclooxygenase inhibitor, epinephrine (0.1 100 mumol/L) caused significant FITC-PAC1 binding (P less .001) maximal 10 mumol/L epinephrine. maximal epinephrine response one third observed 10 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate (ADP) eliminated yohimbine, alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist. Incubation blood apyrase phosphoenolpyruvate plus pyruvate kinase remove extracellular ADP resulted 40% 50% reduction epinephrine response. Despite this, FITC-PAC1 binding still significant epinephrine greater equal 1 mumol/L (P less .05). reduction epinephrine-induced FITC-PAC1 binding observed presence ATP alpha S, ADP receptor antagonist; cinanserin, serotonin antagonist; WEB-2086, platelet activating factor antagonist. Furthermore, addition thrombin inhibitors hirudin leupeptin citrated blood effect extent epinephrine response. Blood anticoagulated hirudin also demonstrated epinephrine response, even presence apyrase. Similar results obtained FITC-9F9 used detect fibrinogen binding aggregation assessed decrease number single platelets. conclude epinephrine induce fibrinogen receptor exposure, fibrinogen binding, aggregation. primary response independent synergistic interaction epinephrine traces ADP, serotonin, platelet activating factor, thrombin. However, synergistic interaction ADP present whole blood may enhance responses induced epinephrine.
