 Neutrophils infiltration/activation following wound induction marks early inflammatory response wound repair. However, role infiltrated/activated neutrophils tissue regeneration/proliferation wound repair well understood. Here, report infiltrated/activated neutrophils wound site release pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) secretive mechanisms early stages wound repair. released extracellular PKM2 facilitates early wound healing promoting angiogenesis wound site. studies reveal new important molecular linker early inflammatory response proliferation phase tissue repair process.
