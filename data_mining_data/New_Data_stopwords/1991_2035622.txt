 effect sterile inflammation sepsis proportion active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) mitochondria isolated skeletal muscle investigated. proportion active PDH mitochondria isolated septic animals significantly reduced compared control incubation conditions examined, even presence inhibitors PDH kinase. significant difference control sterile inflammation incubations examined. rate constant ATP-dependent inactivation PDH complex mitochondrial extracts control animals -0.42 min-1 (r = 0.993; P less 0.001) altered mitochondrial extracts sterile inflammatory animals (-0.43 min-1; r = 0.999; P less 0.001). However, rate constants inactivation septic animals significantly increased twofold -1.08 min-1 (r = 0.987; P less 0.001) (P less 0.001 vs. control sterile inflammation). presence inhibitors PDH kinase reaction (2.5 mM pyruvate 1 mM dichloroacetate), inactivation PDH addition ATP significantly greater mitochondrial extracts septic either control sterile inflammatory animals. results suggest sepsis, sterile inflammation, induces stable factor skeletal muscle mitochondria increased PDH kinase activity.
