 Macronutrient selection patterns male rats analyzed using 3-choice macronutrient selection system providing either adequate (+Zn) deficient (-Zn) levels zinc (30 1 mg Zn/kg). study 1, rats provided +Zn -Zn diets 28 d. rats preferred carbohydrate (>50% carbohydrate intake) onset, consuming average 71% carbohydrate (cho), 17% protein (pro), 12% fat. end study, 25% -Zn rats switched preference cho fat, whereas +Zn rats changed. study 2, -Zn rats preferring fat increased total intake normal levels, 50% reverted carbohydrate preference 35 zinc repletion. Hypothalamic concentrations galanin measured groups +Zn -Zn cho- fat-preferring rats. Galanin, may regulated fat intake, different -Zn rats preferring fat vs. -Zn rats preferring cho. Galanin concentrations higher +Zn -Zn rats (P < 0.05) higher +Zn rats preferring fat +Zn rats preferring cho (P < 0.05). Hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) mRNA concentrations related cho preference, regardless zinc status. PK mRNA levels measured rats consuming single AIN- 93-based diet, PK mRNA levels significantly reduced zinc deficiency (P < 0.05). PK highly regulated insulin, effect insulin may reduced zinc deficiency, making difficult -Zn rats catabolize dietary cho. may explain -Zn rats switched preferring cho fat developing zinc deficiency.
