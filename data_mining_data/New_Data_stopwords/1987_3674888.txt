 contrast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) animal mitochondria, situ vitro studies indicate ATP:ADP ratio little effect regulating mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex green pea seedlings. Pyruvate competitive inhibitor ATP-dependent inactivation (Ki = 59 microM), PDC Km pyruvate microM. Thiamine pyrophosphate, coenzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) component complex, inhibit ATP-dependent inactivation used alone enhanced inhibition pyruvate. such, thiamine pyrophosphate competitive inhibitor (Ki = 130 nM) ATP-dependent inactivation. model proposed pyruvate plus thiamine pyrophosphate inhibition ATP-dependent inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pyruvate exerts inhibition inactivation altering protecting protein substrate phosphorylation directly inhibiting PDH kinase.
