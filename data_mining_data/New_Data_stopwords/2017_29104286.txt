 BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity (body mass index (BMI)30 kg m(-2)) associated increased risk estrogen-dependent breast cancer menopause. Levels aromatase, rate-limiting enzyme estrogen biosynthesis, elevated breast tissue obese women. Recently, regulation aromatase p53-hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha)/pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) axis characterized adipose stromal cells (ASCs) women Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, hereditary cancer syndrome predisposes estrogen-dependent breast cancer. current study aimed determine whether stimulation aromatase obesity-associated adipokine leptin involves regulation p53-HIF1alpha/PKM2 axis. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Human breast ASCs used characterize p53-HIF1alpha/PKM2-aromatase axis response leptin. effect pharmacological genetic modulation protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p53, Aha1, Hsp90, HIF1alpha PKM2 aromatase promoter activity, expression enzyme activity examined. Semiquantitative immunofluorescence confocal imaging used assess ASC-specific protein expression formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections breast women mammary tissue mice following low-fat (LF) high-fat (HF) diet 17 weeks. RESULTS: Leptin-mediated induction aromatase dependent PKC/MAPK signaling suppression p53. This, turn, associated increase Aha1 protein expression, activation Hsp90 stabilization HIF1alpha PKM2, known stimulators aromatase expression. Consistent findings, ASC-specific immunoreactivity p53 inversely associated BMI breast tissue, HIF1alpha, PKM2 aromatase positively correlated BMI. mice, HF feeding associated significantly lower p53 ASC-specific immunoreactivity compared LF feeding, immunoreactivity HIF1alpha, PKM2 aromatase significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings demonstrate novel mechanism obesity-associated increase aromatase ASCs breast support study lifestyle interventions, including weight management, may reduce breast cancer risk via effects pathway.International Journal Obesity advance online publication, 6 February 2018; doi:10.1038/ijo.2017.273.
