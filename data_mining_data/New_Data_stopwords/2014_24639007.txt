 aim study evaluate metabolic profile human prostate cancer cells different metastatic potential determine response dichloroacetate (DCA) using NMR technology. Two isogenic human prostate cancer cell lines, differing metastatic potential [LNCaP (poorly metastatic) LNCaP-LN3 (highly metastatic)], studied. Metabolite ratios NMR spectral integrals acquired field strength 9.4 using 5-mm broadband probe NMR-compatible bioreactor compared presence absence pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor DCA. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes assessed zymography. Following treatment cells 50 mm DCA, significant reduction lactate/choline, lactate/creatine, lactate/alanine combined lactate/(choline + creatine + alanine) ratios LNCaP-LN3 cells relative LNCaP cells. significant changes metabolite ratios found LNCaP cells following DCA treatment. expected, LDH zymography assays showed absence LDH-B subunit LNCaP-LN3 cells, whereas LDH-A LDH-B subunits present LNCaP cells. DCA shown significantly modify metabolite ratios highly metastatic LNCaP-LN3 cells, poorly metastatic LNCaP cells. effect probably related absence LDH-B subunit LNCaP-LN3 cells, could bearing cancer treatment DCA related compounds.
