 interaction monovalent cation yeast pyruvate kinase (yPK) investigated 205Tl+ NMR. TlNO3 activates yPK 80-90% activity compared KCl apparent Ka 1.00 +/- 0.03 mM presence 4 mM Mn(NO3)2 activating divalent cation. higher concentrations Tl+, enzyme inhibition observed apparent KI 180 +/- 10 mM. extent inhibition dependent nature concentration divalent cation. effect Mn2+ 1/T1 1/T2 values 205Tl+ presence yPK determined 173.02 MHz (300 MHz, 1H) 346.03 MHz (600 MHz, 1H). temperature dependence relaxation rates indicates fast exchange conditions prevail 205Tl+ longitudinal relaxation rates. correlation time, tauc, Mn2+-205Tl+ interaction estimated frequency dependence 1/T1m several enzyme complexes, average value tauc determined 0.91 ns. distance Tl+ Mn2+ active site yPK calculated paramagnetic contribution Mn2+ longitudinal (1/T1m) relaxation rates Tl+ bound yPK. apo yPK complex, Tl+ Mn2+ distance 6.7 +/- 0.2 A. Upon addition phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) form yPK-Tl-Mn-PEP complex, inter-cation distance decreases 6.1 +/- 0.3 A. addition allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) form yPK-Tl+-Mn2+-PEP-FBP complex gives intermetal distance 6.2 +/- 0.2 A. yPK-Tl-Mn-FBP complex, Tl+-Mn2+ distance 6.0 +/- 0.1 observed, indicating FBP causes conformational change active site absence PEP. Analogous 205Tl NMR experiments competitive inhibitors PEP (oxalate, BrPEP) indicate ligands induce conformational changes physiological substrates activators. Similar experiments nonallosteric rabbit muscle PK also performed analyzed.
