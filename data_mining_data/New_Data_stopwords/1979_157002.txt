 Diaphragms mice traumatized division parallel transversally muscle fibres. extent traumatization varied degree subdivision. Oxygen uptake measured Warburg technique. Undivided diaphragms control displayed constant oxygen uptake four hours observation. divided diaphragms oxygen uptake unstable. Division parallel muscle fibres resulted continuous decrease oxygen uptake normal initial phase; decline significantly steeper increasing extent traumatization. Division transversally muscle fibres resulted initial increase oxygen uptake followed second phase continuous decrease. initial increase well final decrease oxygen uptake pronounced higher extent subdivision.
