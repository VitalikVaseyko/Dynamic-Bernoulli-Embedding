 Immunogold labelling creatine kinase B (BB-CK) gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase parietal cells stomach revealed colocalization two enzymes apical membrane membranes tubulovesicular system. Upon fractionation hog parietal cells, specific fraction BB-CK proteins remained associated purified vesicles, gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase highly enriched. BB-CK present highly purified preparation able support pronounced H+/K(+)-ATPase activity K(+)-loaded vesicles presence phosphocreatine ADP, although low levels ATP measured. contrast, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate ADP used ATP-generating system sustain similar levels H+/K(+)-ATPase activity, ATP levels 10-fold higher. Changing experimental conditions ATP levels systems resulted significantly elevated H+/K(+)-ATPase activities BB-CK/phosphocreatine system comparison pyruvate kinase/phosphoenolpyruvate system. results indicate gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase preferential access ATP generated creatine kinase co-localized membranes vesicles.
