 Aging viewed quasi-programmed phenomenon driven overactivation nutrient-sensing mTOR gerogene. mTOR-driven aging triggered accelerated decline loss responsiveness activation energy-sensing protein AMPK, critical gerosuppressor mTOR. occurrence age-related diseases, therefore, reflects synergistic interaction evolutionary path sedentarism, chronically increases number mTOR activating gero-promoters (e.g., food, growth factors, cytokines insulin) "defective design" central metabolic integrators mTOR AMPK. laboratories Bioactive Food Component Platform Spain initiated systematic approach molecularly elucidate clinically explore whether "xenohormesis hypothesis," states stress-induced synthesis plant polyphenols many phytochemicals provides environmental chemical signature upregulates stress-resistance pathways plant consumers, explained terms reactivity AMPK/mTOR-axis so-called xenohormetins. Here, explore AMPK/mTOR-xenohormetic nature complex polyphenols naturally present extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), pivotal component Mediterranean style diet repeatedly associated reduction age-related morbid conditions longer life expectancy. Using crude EVOO phenolic extracts highly enriched secoiridoids oleuropein aglycon decarboxymethyl oleuropein aglycon, show first time (1) anticancer activity EVOO secoiridoids related activation anti-aging/cellular stress-like gene signatures, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress unfolded protein response, spermidine polyamine metabolism, sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) NRF2 signaling; (2) EVOO secoiridoids activate AMPK suppress crucial genes involved Warburg effect self-renewal capacity "immortal" cancer stem cells; (3) EVOO secoiridoids prevent age-related changes cell size, morphological heterogeneity, arrayed cell arrangement senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining normal diploid human fibroblasts end proliferative lifespans. EVOO secoiridoids, provide effective defense plant attack herbivores pathogens, bona fide xenohormetins able activate gerosuppressor AMPK trigger numerous resveratrol-like anti-aging transcriptomic signatures. such, EVOO secoiridoids constitute new family plant-produced gerosuppressant agents molecularly "repair" aimless (and harmful) AMPK/mTOR-driven quasi-program leads aging aging-related diseases, including cancer.
