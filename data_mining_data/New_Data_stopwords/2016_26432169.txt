 Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) plays key role phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-PDK1-Akt pathway induces cell survival cardiovascular protections anti-apoptosis, vasodilation, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress activities. Although several reports proposed negative role PDK1 Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, molecular mechanism still unknown. show PDK1 inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) ubiquitination interrupting complex transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) TAK1 binding protein 2 (TAB2), negatively regulates TAK1 activity. overexpression PDK1 293/TLR4 cells resulted suppressions nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation production proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 TNF-alpha response lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Conversely, THP-1 human monocytes transiently cultured low glucose medium displayed down-regulated PDK1 expression, significantly enhanced TLR4-mediated signaling activation NF-kappaB, demonstrating negative role PDK1. Biochemical studies revealed PDK1 significantly interacted TAK1, resulting inhibition association TAB2 TAK1, led attenuation TRAF6 ubiquitination. Moreover, PDK1-knockdown THP-1 cells displayed enhancement downstream signals, activation NF-kappaB, increased production pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, potentially led up-regulation NF-kappaB-dependent genes response TLR4 stimulation. Collectively, results demonstrate PDK1 inhibits formation TAK1-TAB2-TRAF6 complex leads inhibition TRAF6 ubiquitination, negatively regulates TLR4-mediated signaling NF-kappaB activation.
