 primary culture adult rat hepatocytes, vanadate presence glucose stimulates expression liver (L-type) pyruvate kinase gene. Glucose inactive, vanadate, like insulin, also inefficient absence glucose. Similar results obtained glucokinase gene expression. analogue cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, inhibited production L-type pyruvate kinase glucokinase mRNAs presence glucose plus vanadate.
