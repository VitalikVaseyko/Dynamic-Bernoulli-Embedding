 HISTORY ADMISSION FINDINGS: 36-year-old man reported feeling generally unwell experiencing shooting tearing pain, especially thighs precordium, returning five-week holiday Central Africa. active sportsman youth (fencing) known incomplete right bundle branch block ECG raised concentration gamma-glutamyl transferase, unknown aetiology. Physical examination admission negative except discrete weakness head bending slightly delayed finger stretching making fist. INVESTIGATIONS: Multiple tests excluded tropical diseases. abnormal waves leads III V1 ECG. Serum concentrations creatine kinase (CK; maximally 822 U/l), gamma-glutamyl transaminase (gamma-GT; 446 U/l), glutamyl-pyruvate transaminase (GPT; 510 U/l) glutamate-oxalate transaminase (GOT; 108 U/l) elevated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate C-reactive protein within normal limits. TREATMENT COURSE: first suspected diagnosis myocarditis placed bed-rest, monitored treated symptomatically. levels CK, gamma-GT, GPT GOT improved transiently, signs inflammatory disease muscle pains continued, biopsies skeletal muscle liver done. revealed nonspecific liver changes noninflammatory myopathy. congenital myopathy suspected transferred neurology department diagnosis proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) established. CONCLUSION: assume unknown viral infection triggered illness that, addition usual nonspecific symptoms, accentuated signs existing multi-system proximal myotonic myopathy.
