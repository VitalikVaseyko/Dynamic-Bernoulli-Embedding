 Hsp100/Clp proteins crucial functions protein quality control, stress tolerance, virulence many pathogenic bacteria. ClpE important virulence factor involved adherence invasion Streptococcus pneumoniae. explore underlying mechanism, screened ClpE interaction proteins using bacterial two-hybrid system co-immunoprecipitation. used ClpE bait constructed pBT-ClpE bait plasmid two-hybrid screening. Then, constructed ClpE::GFP fusion co-immunoprecipitation screening using anti-GFP monoclonal antibody. obtained eight potential ClpE interaction proteins, including carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase, aminopeptidase N (pepN), L-lactate dehydrogenase, ribosomal protein S4, sensor histidine kinase (SPD_2019), FtsW (a cell division protein). FtsW, SpxB, pepN, SPD_2019 confirmed interact ClpE using Bacterial Two-hybrid Co-immunoprecipitation. Morphologic observations found DeltaclpE strain existed abnormal division. beta-Galactosidase activity assay suggested ClpE contributed degradation FtsW. Furthermore, FtsW could induced heat shock. results suggested ClpE might affect cell division regulating level FtsW. data may provide new insights studying role ClpE S. pneumoniae.
