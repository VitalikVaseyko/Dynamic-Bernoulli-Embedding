 intracellular proteins undergo continuous synthesis degradation. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) necessary maintain cellular homeostasis turnover cytosolic proteins (substrate proteins). degradation involves series substrate proteins including cancer promoters suppressors. Since activating inhibiting CMA pathway treat cancer still debated, targeting CMA substrate proteins provides novel direction. summarize cancer-associated substrate proteins degraded CMA. Consequently, CMA substrate proteins catalyze glycolysis contributes Warburg effect cancer cells. fact degradation substrate proteins based CMA altered posttranslational modifications phosphorylation acetylation. conclusion, targeting CMA substrate proteins develops new anticancer therapeutic approach.
