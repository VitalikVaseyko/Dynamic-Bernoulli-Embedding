 Ph-positive leukemia, imatinib brought marked clinical improvement; however, improvement needed prevent relapse. Cancer cells efficiently use limited energy sources, drugs targeting cellular metabolism improve efficacy therapy. study, characterized effects novel anti-cancer fatty-acid derivative AIC-47 imatinib, focusing cancer-specific energy metabolism chronic myeloid leukemia cells. AIC-47 imatinib combination exhibited significant synergic cytotoxicity. Imatinib inhibited phosphorylation BCR-ABL; whereas AIC-47 suppressed expression protein itself. AIC-47 imatinib modulated expression pyruvate kinase (PKM) isoforms PKM2 PKM1 down-regulation polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1). PTBP1 functions alternative splicing repressor PKM1, resulting expression PKM2, inactive form pyruvate kinase last step glycolysis. Although inactivation BCR-ABL imatinib strongly suppressed glycolysis, compensatory fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) activation supported glucose-independent cell survival up-regulating CPT1C, rate-limiting FAO enzyme. contrast, AIC-47 inhibited expression CPT1C directly fatty-acid metabolism. findings also observed CD34(+) fraction Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. results suggest AIC-47 combination imatinib strengthened attack cancer energy metabolism, terms glycolysis compensatory activation FAO.
