 Gliomas highly heterogeneous tumor, refractory treatment frequently diagnosed primary brain tumor. Although current grading system (2016) demonstrates promise towards identifying novel treatment modalities better prediction prognosis time, date, existing targeted mono therapy approaches failed elicit robust impact disease progression patient survival. possible tumor heterogeneity well specifically targeted agents fail redundant molecular pathways tumor make refractory approaches. Additionally, underlying metabolic pathology, significantly altered neoplastic transformation tumor progression, unaccounted for. several molecular metabolic pathways implicated carcinogenesis CNS tumors, including glioma, postulate systemic, broad spectrum approach produce robust targeting relevant multiple molecular metabolic regulation growth survival pathways, critical modulation hallmarks carcinogenesis, without clinically limiting toxicity, may provide sustained impact clinical outcomes compared modalities treatment evaluated date. objective review examine emerging hallmark reprogramming energy metabolism tumor cells tumor microenvironment carcinogenesis, provide rationale exploiting hallmark biological capabilities target secondary chemoprevention treatment glioma. review primarily focus interventions induce ketosis target glycolytic phenotype many cancers, specific application secondary chemoprevention low grade glioma- halt progression lower grade tumors aggressive subtypes, evidenced reduction validated intermediate endpoints disease progression including clinical symptoms.
