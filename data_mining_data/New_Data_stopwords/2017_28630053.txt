 Different pyruvate kinase isoforms expressed tissue-specific manner, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) suggested predominant isoform proliferating cells cancer cells. differential regulation enzymatic activities, PKM2, PKM1, thought favor cell proliferation. However, role PKM2 tumorigenesis recently challenged. report increased glucose catabolism glycolysis increased pyruvate kinase activity c-MYC-driven liver tumors associated increased expression PKM1 PKM2 isoforms decreased expression liver-specific isoform pyruvate kinase, PKL. Depletion PKM2 time c-MYC overexpression murine livers affect c-MYC-induced tumorigenesis resulted liver tumor formation decreased pyruvate kinase activity decreased catabolism glucose alanine Krebs cycle. increased PKM1/PKM2 ratio ectopic PKM1 expression decreased glucose flux serine biosynthesis increased flux lactate Krebs cycle, resulting reduced total levels serine. However, changes also affect c-MYC-induced liver tumor development. results suggest increased expression PKM2 required support c-MYC-induced tumorigenesis liver various PKM1/PKM2 ratios pyruvate kinase activities sustain glucose catabolism required process.
