 unique feature cancer cells convert glucose lactate produce cellular energy, even presence oxygen. Called aerobic glycolysis [The Warburg Effect] extensively studied concept aerobic glycolysis tumor cells generally accepted. However, clear aerobic glycolysis tumor cells fixed, reversed, especially therapeutic stress conditions. Here, report mTOR, critical regulator cell proliferation, relocated mitochondria, result, enhances oxidative phosphorylation reduces glycolysis. Three tumor cell lines (breast cancer MCF-7, colon cancer HCT116 glioblastoma U87) showed quick relocation mTOR mitochondria irradiation single dose 5 Gy, companied decreased lactate production, increased mitochondrial ATP generation oxygen consumption. Inhibition mTOR rapamycin blocked radiation-induced mTOR mitochondrial relocation shift glycolysis mitochondrial respiration, reduced clonogenic survival. irradiated cells, mTOR formed complex Hexokinase II [HK II], key mitochondrial protein regulation glycolysis, causing reduced HK II enzymatic activity. results support novel mechanism tumor cells quickly adapt genotoxic conditions via mTOR-mediated reprogramming bioenergetics predominantly aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. "waking-up" pathway mitochondrial bioenergetics demonstrates flexible feature energy metabolism cancer cells, may required additional cellular energy consumption damage repair survival. Thus, reversible cellular energy metabolisms considered blocking tumor metabolism may targeted sensitize anti-cancer therapy.
