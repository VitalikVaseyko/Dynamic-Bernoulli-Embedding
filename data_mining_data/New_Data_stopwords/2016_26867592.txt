 BACKGROUND: oleaginous fungus, Mucor circinelloides, attracting considerable interest produces oil rich gamma-linolenic acid. Nitrogen (N) deficiency common strategy trigger lipid accumulation oleaginous microorganisms. Although simple pathway N depletion medium lipid accumulation elucidated enzymatic level, global changes protein levels upon N depletion investigated. study, systematically analyzed changes levels protein expression M. circinelloides WJ11, high lipid-producing strain (36 %, lipid/cell dry weight), lipid accumulation. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis demonstrated N depletion increased expression glutamine synthetase, involved ammonia assimilation, supply cellular nitrogen decreased metabolism amino acids. Upon N deficiency, many proteins (e.g., fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase) involved glycolytic pathway up-regulated proteins involved tricarboxylic acid cycle (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA ligase, succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase) down-regulated, indicating activity retarded thereby leading greater flux carbon fatty acid biosynthesis. Moreover, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, transaldolase transketolase, participate pentose phosphate pathway, up-regulated, leading increased production NADPH, reducing power fatty acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, protein nucleic acid metabolism down-regulated proteins involved energy metabolism, signal transduction, molecular chaperone redox homeostasis up-regulated upon N depletion, may cellular response stress produced onset N deficiency. CONCLUSION: N limitation increased expressions proteins involved ammonia assimilation decreased involved biosynthesis amino acids. Upon N deprivation, glycolytic pathway up-regulated, activity tricarboxylic acid cycle retarded, thus, leading carbon flux fatty acid biosynthesis. Moreover, pentose phosphate pathway up-regulated, would increase production NADPH. Together, coordinated regulation central carbon metabolism upon N limitation, provides carbon flux acetyl-CoA NADPH fatty acid biosynthesis.
