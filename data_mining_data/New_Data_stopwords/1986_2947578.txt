 found levamisole, anthelmintic drug, used also immunomodulator human cancer therapy, strong inhibitor tumour aerobic glycolysis. vitro, Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT) cells supernatants diminishes glucose uptake lactate formation. not, however, exert similar inhibitory effect glycolytic activity normal liver muscle supernatants. Metabolic enzymatic studies shown levamisole directly inhibits tumour phosphofructokinase decreasing ATP, well 2-phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate glycolytic intermediates. L-Cysteine used comparison also another inhibitor tumour aerobic glycolysis, decreasing glucose uptake lactate formation diminishing pyruvate ATP levels, differs accompanying increase 2-phosphoenolpyruvate concentration. crossing-over metabolite concentration, seen tumour material, points tumour pyruvate kinase isoenzyme sensitive cysteine inhibition. Direct enzymatic studies confirmed suggestion. similarities influence metabolism compounds studied discussed, well role effects observed understanding mechanisms levamisole action (also worms).
