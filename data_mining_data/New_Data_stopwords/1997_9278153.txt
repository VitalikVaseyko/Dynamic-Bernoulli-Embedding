 gene encoding pyruvate kinase type (PKI) Escherichia coli amplified PCR, cloned sequenced. gene product overexpressed E. coli, using inducible T7 RNA polymerase-based expression system. transformed cells contained sixtyfold enzyme activity reference cells enabled purification 30 mg highly active PKI 1 liter culture. gene sequence determined found different one previously reported, i.e., nucleotide position 1351 missing. resulted downstream shift stop codon, thus deduced polypeptide 470 amino acids long instead 462. addition twelve C-terminal amino acids former sequence changed.
