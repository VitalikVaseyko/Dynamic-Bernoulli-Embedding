 Cancer cells engage metabolic program enhance biosynthesis support cell proliferation. regulatory properties pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) influence altered glucose metabolism cancer. interaction PKM2 phosphotyrosine-containing proteins inhibits enzyme activity increases availability glycolytic metabolites support cell proliferation. suggests high pyruvate kinase activity may suppress tumor growth. show expression PKM1, pyruvate kinase isoform high constitutive activity, exposure published small-molecule PKM2 activators inhibits growth xenograft tumors. Structural studies reveal small-molecule activators bind PKM2 subunit interaction interface, site distinct endogenous activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). However, unlike FBP, binding activators PKM2 promotes constitutively active enzyme state resistant inhibition tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. data support notion small-molecule activation PKM2 interfere anabolic metabolism.
