 Energy redistribution growth maintenance salt-stressed cells especially important bacteria living estuarine environments. study, Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio sp. DSM14379, isolated estuarine waters northern Adriatic Sea, grown aerobically peptone-yeast extract medium different salt concentrations (ranging 0.3% 10% (w/v) NaCl). Carbon flux central metabolic pathways determined low high salt concentrations. low salt concentrations, total endogenous respiration, dehydrogenase activity, net intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration significantly increased, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activity decreased, whereas glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity remained unchanged. carrying capacity bacterial culture decreased dramatically, indicating severe metabolic imbalance low salt concentrations. high salt concentrations, carrying capacity decreased gradually. large increase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, correlated 10-fold increase concentration osmoprotectant L-proline. significant change net intracellular ATP concentration, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase activity. results indicate Vibrio sp. DSM14379 central metabolic pathways respond low high salt concentrations asymmetrically; cells better adapted high salt concentrations. addition, cells stationary phase tolerate induced salt stress without significant change dehydrogenase activity endogenous respiration least 1 h, need alter macromolecular composition carbon flux distribution long-term survival.
