 1. Cataract formation streptozotocin-induced diabetes rats reduced approximately 85% diet rich maize oil (300 g/kg diet) (fat diet) given, thus confirming results earlier studies. However, concentration sorbitol lens diabetic animals remained high, values diabetic rats given standard diet fat died 65 40 mumol/g protein respectively. 2. standard diet, fatty acid profile triglycerides epididymal fat pads characterized greater relative proportion saturated fatty acids diabetic animals compared normal animals. fat diet moderated tendency towards saturation diabetic animals. 3. fat diet effects diabetic animals; included reduced mortality rate, increased body-weight, decrease daily water intake, daily urinary excretion glucose urea. 4. diabetic animals fat diet effect specific activities liver hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). However, specific activity glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) reduced, malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.40) increased. NAD+:NADH ratio, calculated liver pyruvate lactate concentrations, tended increase. 5. results suggested fat diet moderated long-term metabolic effects diabetes.
