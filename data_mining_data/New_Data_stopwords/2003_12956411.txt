 metabolic pathways involved ATP production hypertriglyceridemic rat hearts evaluated. Hearts male Wistar rats sugar-induced hypertriglyceridemia perfused isolated organ system. Mechanical performance, oxygen uptake beat rate evaluated perfusion different oxidizable substrates. Age- weight-matched animals used control. hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) hearts showed decrease mechanical work slight diminution oxygen uptake perfused glucose, pyruvate lactate. differences found perfused palmitate, octanoate beta-hydroxybutyrate. glycolytic flux HTG hearts 2.4 times lower control hearts. Phosphofructokinase-I (PFK-I) 16% decreased HTG hearts, whereas pyruvate kinase activity change. increased levels glucose-6-phosphate HTG heart, suggested flux limitation PFK-I. Pyruvate dehydrogenase active form (PDHa) diminished well. PDHa level HTG hearts restored control values dichloroacetate; however, addition significantly improve mechanical performance. Levels ATP phosphocreatine well total creatine kinase activity MB fraction significant lower HTG hearts perfused glucose. data suggested supply ATP glucose oxidation suffice support cardiac work HTG hearts; impairment exacerbated diminution creatine kinase system output.
