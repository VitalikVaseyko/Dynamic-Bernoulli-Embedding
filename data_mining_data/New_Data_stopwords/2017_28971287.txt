 Epinephelus morio large carnivorous species Caribbean Sea reproduction captivity nutritional physiology. diet raw cornstarch (RCS) compared basal diet without starch (basal) measure plasma glucose, liver glycogen, intermediary metabolism. Glucose level change (p > 0.05) whereas liver glycogen significantly higher fish fed RCS diet (137.2 +/- 14.5 mg g(-1)) fish fed basal diet (87.4 +/- 14.5 mg g(-1)). Oral glucose administration (170 mg glucose per 100 g body weight) yielded slight change; two peaks plasma glucose recorded basal (5.6 mM L(-1)) 2 h oral administration 12 h (6.4 mM L(-1)). 24 h, 1.7 mM L(-1), fish returned initial stage (2.4 mM L(-1)). RCS diet produced highest level (6.3 mM L(-1)) 2 h oral administration; lowest level observed 24 h oral administration (1.0 mM L(-1)). significant effect detected presence absence dietary carbohydrates (CBH) hepatic fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase pyruvate kinase activity. Grouper used two strategies maintain glucose homeostasis: CBH present diet oriented towards gluconeogenesis, whereas dietary CBH enhanced glycolytic route liberate glucose increase liver glycogen.
