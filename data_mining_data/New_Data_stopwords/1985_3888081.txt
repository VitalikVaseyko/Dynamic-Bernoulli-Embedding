 Mitochondria contain four distinct compartments selectively permeable inner membrane. compartments provide important means regulation mitochondrial activity via various carrier translocase activities. Nutritional substrates derived glucose, fatty acids, branched chain amino acids utilized mitochondria tightly controlled manner. control provided specific dehydrogenase enzymes carnitine related reactions dependent cellular needs energy availability various substrates. Several possible vivo controllers mitochondrial respiration exist. review examined: dependence mitochondrial function oxygen availability, cellular phosphate potential, adenine nucleotide translocase activity; role adenosine regulator coronary flow providing link mitochondrial metabolism; importance creatine-phosphate shuttle existence separate mitochondrial myofibrillar creatine-kinase enzymes; physiologically important mechanisms regulation mitochondrial metabolic activity heart.
