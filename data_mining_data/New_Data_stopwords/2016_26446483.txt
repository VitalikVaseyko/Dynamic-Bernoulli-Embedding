 BACKGROUND: term vitamin E describes family 8 vitamers, 1 alpha-tocopherol, essential human health. Vitamin E status remains largely unknown low-income countries complexity cost measurement. Quantitative proteomics may offer approach identifying plasma proteins assessing vitamin E status populations. OBJECTIVE: improve options vitamin E status assessment, sought detect quantify set plasma proteins associated alpha- gamma-tocopherol concentrations cohort 500 rural Nepalese children aged 6-8 and, based nutrient-protein associations, predict prevalence vitamin E deficiency (alpha-tocopherol <12 mumol/L). METHODS: Study children born mothers enrolled earlier antenatal micronutrient trial Sarlahi District, Nepal. Plasma alpha- gamma-tocopherol concentrations measured high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma aliquots depleted 6 high-abundance proteins, digested trypsin, labeled isobaric mass tags, assessed relative protein abundance tandem mass spectrometry. Linear mixed-effects models used evaluate association alpha-tocopherol status relative protein abundance predict deficiency. RESULTS: quantified 982 plasma proteins >10% child samples, 119 correlated alpha-tocopherol (false discovery rate, q < 0.10). Proteins primarily involved lipid transport, coagulation, repair, innate host defenses, neural function, homeostasis. Six proteins [apolipoprotein (apo)C-III; apoB; pyruvate kinase, muscle; forkhead box 04; unc5 homolog C; regulator G-protein signaling 8] explained 71% variability plasma alpha-tocopherol, predicting in-sample population prevalence vitamin E deficiency 51.4% (95% CI: 46.4%, 56.3%) compared measured prevalence 54.8%. Plasma gamma-tocopherol associated 12 proteins (q < 0.10), 2 (apoC-III Misato 1) explained 20% variability. CONCLUSIONS: undernourished population children South Asia, quantitative proteomics identified large plasma alpha-tocopherome 6 proteins predicted prevalence vitamin E deficiency. findings illustrate protein biomarkers, absolutely quantified, potentially predict micronutrient deficiencies populations. maternal micronutrient supplementation trial data derived follow-up activity registered clinicaltrials.gov NCT00115271.
