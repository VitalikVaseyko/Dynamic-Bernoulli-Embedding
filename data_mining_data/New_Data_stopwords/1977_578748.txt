 investigated whether N,N-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride (metformin) lowers blood glucose levels stimulating glucose uptake skeletal muscle using isolated perfused rat hindquarter. Osborne-Mendel rats subjected special feeding regimen (food intake 2 h daily) treated orally metformin (125 mg/kg body weight twice daily) placebo, respectively. hypoglycemic effect metformin could demonstrated. Thereafter, control rats perfused absence, metformin-treated rats presence added metformin (0.67 microgram/ml perfusate). Neither basal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake skeletal muscle increased metformin. Lactate alanine release, O2 uptake well tissue metabolite levels glucose, lactate, pyruvate, ATP creatine-P remained unaffected. hand, metformin caused significant decline lactate oxidation well elevated glycogen content skeletal muscle. proposed inhibition lactate oxidation may certain conditions instrumental development lactic acidosis associated biguanide therapy.
