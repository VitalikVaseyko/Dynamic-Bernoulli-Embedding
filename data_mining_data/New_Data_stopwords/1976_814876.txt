 vivo tracer studies 14C performed help determine pathways incorporation newly assimilated nitrogen N2-fixing cells Anabaena cylindrica. photosynthesis Ar: O2:14CO2 30 min, addition N2 NH+4 resulted increased rates 14CO2-incorporation light dark, increased incorporation 14C amino acids expense sucrose sugar phosphates. Evidence enhanced sucrose catabolism increased pyruvate kinase activity obtained adding nitrogen, and, 14C-labelling entering tricarboxylic acid cycle, appeared citrate 2-oxoglutarate malate oxaloacetate. kinetics 14C-incorporation various amino acids suggest light dark important route primary ammonia assimilation involves glutamine synthetase glutamate, aspartate, glycine probably alanine formed secondarily glutamine.
