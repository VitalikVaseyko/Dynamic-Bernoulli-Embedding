 study describes metabolic capacities African cichlid Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae four sites Uganda, East Africa. Fish captured dry season, two aquatic systems different regions (Lake Nabugabo Mpanga River). Within Lake Nabugabo region, individuals sampled Lake Kayanja (normoxic) Lwamunda Swamp (hypoxic); within Mpanga River system, individuals sampled Bunoga Kahunge (characterized seasonal variation dissolved oxygen (D.O.)). Enzyme activity levels pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, cytochrome C oxidase measured four tissues: white skeletal muscle, heart, brain, liver. Two additional enzymes measured liver, malate dehydrogenase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. Regional differences enzyme activities tissues evident; however, little variation observed two sites within region despite differences D.O. general, P. multicolor Mpanga River system displayed greater anaerobic enzyme activity white skeletal muscle, lower gluconeogenic enzyme activity liver, overall higher enzyme activity heart brain tissues fish Nabugabo region. latter may reflect long-term adaptation low-oxygen conditions metapopulation level Nabugabo region.
