 paper presents dielectric properties alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) ac electric field. Using Hg-SAM/SAM-Hg junction, measured ac impedance alkanethiol SAMs using sinusoidal perturbation 30 mV (peak-to-peak) frequency ranging 1 Hz 1 MHz zero bias. Semicircles higher frequencies middle frequencies along Warburg lines lower frequencies observed complex plane impedance plots, is, Nyquist plots. frequency response SAMs analyzed modeling junction using equivalent circuit fitting Nyquist plots. semicircles higher frequencies attributed effect SAM/SAM interfaces, ones middle frequencies attributed effect alkanethiol SAMs. comparison plots imaginary part impedance Z frequency bare Hg electrodes (in pure ethanal) SAM-covered Hg electrodes (in alkanethiol solution) supports analysis. Warburg lines attributed certain ionic impurity. dielectric loss spectra analyzed. Chain-length-dependent peaks, correspond different relaxation mechanisms, higher frequencies middle frequencies observed spectra dissipation factor (tan delta vs frequency). peaks move small frequency increase chain length alkanethiols. Using correlation peak position chain length, derived active energies 39-99 meV alkanethiol SAMs C7-C18 ac electric field.
