 Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118 probiotic bacterium originally isolated human intestinal tissues subsequently shown pilot study alleviate symptoms associated mild-moderate Crohn's disease. Strain UCC118 adhere animal human intestinal tissue, healthy inflamed ulcerative colitis mucosa, irrespective location gut. study, enzymatic technique combined proteomic analysis correlate bacterial growth phase presence factors present cell wall bacterium. Using PAGE electrophoresis, determined progression lag log stationary growth phases vitro correlated increasing prominence 84kD protein associated vitro adherence ability. Isolated proteins 84kD band region separated two-dimensional electrophoresis, resolving band 20 individual protein spots differing isoelectric points. protein moieties excised, trypsin digested subjected tandem mass spectrometry. observed proteins analogous reported associated Listeria monocytogenes cell-wall proteome, include DnaK, Ef-Ts pyruvate kinase. data suggest least beneficial attributes probiotic lactobacilli, particular strain, may due nonpathogenic mimicry pathogens potentially mediated form attenuated virulence.
