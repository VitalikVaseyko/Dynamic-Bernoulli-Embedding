 amino acid sequence requirements androgen-dependent androgen receptor nuclear import determined immunostaining transiently expressed full-length wild type mutant human androgen receptors (AR) monkey kidney COS cells measuring transcriptional activity cotransfection luciferase reporter vector monkey kidney CV1 cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed bipartite nuclear targeting sequence DNA binding hinge regions amino acids 617-633, consisting two clusters basic amino acids separated 10 amino acids, (sequence: see text). series deletion mutants, AR NH2-terminal fragments (residues 1-639 1-723) displayed constitutive nuclear import, transcriptional activity similar ligand-activated full-length wild type AR. contrast, nuclear import transcriptional activation inhibited sequence extensions steroid-binding domain (1-771). Constitutive nuclear import regained part NH2-terminal deletions full-length AR. Expression AR/pyruvate kinase chimeras defined sequence required pre-dominant nuclear localization residues 580-661, comprised second zinc finger region DNA-binding domain, 17-amino-acid putative targeting sequence, 28 residues flanking carboxyl-terminal sequence. studies suggest bipartite nuclear targeting sequence AR includes flanking sequence modulated interactions NH2-and carboxyl-terminal regions.
