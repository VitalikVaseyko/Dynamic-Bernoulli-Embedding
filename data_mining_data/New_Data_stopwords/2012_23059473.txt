 Previous studies laboratory shown testosterone (T) 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) co-operate inhibit cell proliferation induce significant changes gene expression differentiation LNCaP cells. data presented demonstrate two agents alter fatty acid metabolism, accumulation neutral lipid. Concurrent genome wide analysis mRNA miRNA LNCaP cells reveals extensive transcription regulatory network modulated 1,25(OH)2D3. involves androgen receptor (AR)- vitamin receptor (VDR)-mediated transcription, also transcription factors E2F1- c-Myc-dependent transcription. Changes activities transcription factors alter steady state levels several miRNAs, including miR-17/92 cluster. changes correlate up-regulation mRNA encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) downstream targets, leading increased lipogenesis. data suggest coordinated effect 1,25(OH)2D3 prostate cancer cells increases lipogenesis, diverting energy away Warburg-based tumor energy metabolism, slows halts cell growth tumor progression. article part Special Issue entitled 'Vitamin Workshop'.
