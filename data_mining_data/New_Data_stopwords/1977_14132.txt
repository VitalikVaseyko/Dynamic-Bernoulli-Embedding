 paper reports discovery protein kinase activity associated inner membrane mammalian mitochondria. enzyme respond addition cyclic AMP cyclic GMP preference whole histone phosphate acceptor. standard assay systems cyclic nucleotide-dependent cytosol protein kinases would unable pick activity orthophosphate concentration higher 25 mM pH assay lower pH 6.5. enzyme described apparent pH optimum 8.5. Activity liver mitochondria evident unless mitochondria disrupted either sonication freezing thawing. Distribution kinase activity centrifugal fractions liver heart mitochondrial sonicates parallel two inner membrane marker enzymes succinic dehydrogenase cytochrome oxidase quite different matrix enzyme malic dehydrogenase. Experiments preparations enriched outer inner membranes confirmed contention enzyme located inner membrane. Since disruption inner membrane freeze-thaw treatment (after outer membrane disrupted swelling phosphate) necessary full expression activity enzyme, tentative conclusion reached substrate accepted matrix side inner membrane.
