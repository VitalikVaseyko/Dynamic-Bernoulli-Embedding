 BACKGROUND/AIM: 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) mediates cellular effects various growth factors. Increased PDK1 expression present various cancers, suggesting PDK1 may critical oncogene cancer progression. However, limited data exist PDK1 expression ovarian serous cancer. MATERIALS METHODS: used tissue microarrays analyze PDK1 expression 253 primary ovarian serous carcinoma samples. RESULTS: statistically significant negative correlation PDK1 expression tumor grade found. high-grade group ovarian serous carcinomas (n=189), statistically significant difference overall survival cases positive negative PDK1 expression (p=0.035); positive cases showed longer overall survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed slight PDK1 expression independent indicator prolonged overall survival (HR=0.51, 95% CI=0.28-0.92, p=0.025). CONCLUSION: PDK1 appears prognostic marker possible therapeutic target ovarian serous carcinoma.
