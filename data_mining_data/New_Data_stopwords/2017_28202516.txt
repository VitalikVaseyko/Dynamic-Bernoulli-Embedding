 Abnormal metabolism hallmark cancer, yet regulation remains poorly understood. Cancer cells considered utilize primarily glycolysis ATP production, referred Warburg effect. However, recent evidence suggests oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) plays crucial role cancer progression. utilized systems biology approach decipher regulatory principle glycolysis OXPHOS. Integrating information literature, constructed regulatory network genes metabolites, extracted core circuit containing HIF-1, AMPK, ROS. circuit analysis showed normal cells oxidative state glycolytic state, cancer cells access hybrid state metabolic modes coexisting. due higher ROS production and/or oncogene activation, RAS, MYC, c-SRC. Guided model, developed two signatures consisting AMPK HIF-1 downstream genes, respectively, quantify activity glycolysis OXPHOS. applying AMPK HIF-1 signatures Cancer Genome Atlas patient transcriptomics data multiple cancer types single-cell RNA-seq data lung adenocarcinoma, confirmed anticorrelation AMPK HIF-1 activities association metabolic states oncogenes. propose hybrid phenotype contributes metabolic plasticity, allowing cancer cells adapt various microenvironments. Using model simulations, theoretical framework metabolism serve platform decode cancer metabolic plasticity design cancer therapies targeting metabolism. Cancer Res; 77(7); 1564-74. (c)2017 AACR.
