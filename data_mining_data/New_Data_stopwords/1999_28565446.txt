 Previous studies shown least two lineages Enallagma damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) shifted inhabiting lakes fish top predators inhabiting ponds lakes large dragonflies top predators. adapting living new predator type, lineages evolved much greater swimming speeds avoid attacking dragonflies. paper, test whether biochemical adaptations fuel swimming arose concert previously identified morphological changes increase swimming speed. assayed mass-specific enzyme activities three enzymes involved fueling strenuous activity: pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase (enzymes involved glycolysis) arginine kinase (the enzyme recharges ATP pool). Enzyme activities determined 14 Enallagma species across genus. Species coexist dragonfly predators significantly higher mass-specific arginine kinase activities species coexist fish, results evolutionary contrasts analyses indicate difference two groups result evolutionary change associated habitat shifts lineages fish lakes dragonfly lakes. Although significant evolution documented lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase across genus, evolutionary change activities enzymes consistent adaptation coexisting dragonfly predators. Swimming bouts avoid dragonfly predators last seconds, action arginine kinase phosphorylate ADP make ATP extend duration maximal exertion swimming seconds. However, much longer time periods (over 45 sec) required generate ATP via glycolysis. Therefore, selection may favored adaptation arginine kinase locus.
