 Two erythroleukemia cell lines established splenic lesions red blood cell-type pyruvate kinase (R-PK) activity-deficient mice CBA/N origin infected polycythemic strain Friend leukemia virus complex (FVp). Ten 30% cells cell lines undergo apoptotic changes routine passage, shown nuclear fragmentation, DNA laddering, DNA content (propidium iodide (PI) staining), annexin V binding assay. cells, however, although adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels lower control cells, mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (delta psi m), detected rhodamine 123 (R123) diSC3(5) staining, remained unchanged final stage apoptosis. evidence obtained relate finding R-PK mutation due difficulty cloning stable, conditionally inducible R-PK gene transfectants. However, low delta psi apoptotic cell population control T3-K-1 (K-1) T3-CI-2-0 (2-0) Friend erythroleukemia cells supports possible relationship, results obtained two Friend erythroleukemia cells recently isolated normal CBA/N mice. cell lines expected useful clarifying primary apoptotic changes independent mitochondrial dysfunction PK-isozyme changes erythrodifferentiation, example, decreased muscle type 2 (M2) PK level. Modification growth signals cell lines may modulate differentiation and/or apoptosis allow elucidation signaling networks.
