 BACKGROUND: Tenderness considered important quality characteristic meat main cause unacceptability meat. Post-translational modification regulates protein functions involve postmortem changes muscle meat quality formation. Specifically, phosphorylation proved regulate postmortem glycolytic rates meat tenderisation. However, relationship protein phosphorylation meat tenderness remains unclear. study examined phosphoproteomes found ovine muscle different degrees tenderness time (at 0.5 h, 4 h, 24 h postmortem). RESULTS: study detected five, eight nine phosphoprotein spots (>two-fold change, P < 0.05) respective time point. different phosphoproteins found included glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, tropomyosin alpha-1 chain, pyruvate kinase, myosin binding protein H, glycogen phosphorylase, alpha-actinin-3, uncharacterised protein (GN, myosin-binding protein C2, MYBPC2). different phosphoproteins maintained sarcomeric functions, involved glycometabolism. CONCLUSION: Phosphorylation levels multiple proteins involved glycolysis, muscle contraction sarcomeric structure integrity identified ovine muscles different tenderness. differential phosphorylation proteins explains part difference meat tenderness.
