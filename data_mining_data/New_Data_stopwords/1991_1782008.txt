 rat kidney several mitochondrial soluble enzyme activities stimulated thyroid hormones mitochondrial membrane fluidity also increased. However, ketone metabolism enzyme activities D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase significantly affected hyperthyroid state ketone body concentration greatly changed. Therefore, hyperthyroid rats response kidney, far ketone bodies metabolizing enzymes concerned, variance liver heart. brain young rats, age 8-9 weeks, activities enzymes ketone body metabolism responsible metabolic pathways influenced hyperthyroid state. animals, however, activities two enzymes, NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, still stimulated 28 41%, respectively. probably related higher energy requirement definitive brain maturation young hyperthyroid rats.
