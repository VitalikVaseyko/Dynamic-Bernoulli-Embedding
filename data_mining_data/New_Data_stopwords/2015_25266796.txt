 Cancer cells exhibit ability metabolise glucose lactate even aerobic conditions energy. phenomenon known Warburg effect potential target kill cancer cells. Several studies shown evidence interplay microRNAs key metabolic enzyme effecters, facilitate Warburg effect cancer cells. present study, microRNA sponge forcibly expressed using lentiviral vector utilised knock miR-21 expression vitro. qPCR Western blot assays performed evaluate expression regulatory factor related aerobic glycolysis signalling pathway regulates. bladder cancer specimens, expression levels glycolysis-related genes [glucose transporter (GLUT)1, GLUT3, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)A, LDHB, hexokinase (HK)1, HK2, pyruvate kinase type (PKM) hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha)] higher tumour tissues adjacent tissues, suggesting role glycolysis bladder cancer. miR-21 inhibition bladder cancer cell lines resulted reduction tumour aerobic glycolysis. Decrease glucose uptake lactate production observed upon expression miR-21 sponge, promoted phosphatase tensin homologue (PTEN) expression, decreased phosphorylated AKT deactivated mTOR. Furthermore, messenger RNA (mRNA) protein expression levels glycolysis-related genes also lower miR-21 sponge cells compared miR-21 control cells. findings suggest miR-21 acts molecular switch regulate aerobic glycolysis bladder cancer cells via PTEN/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway. Blocking miR-21 function effective diagnostic therapeutic approach either combination existing methods treat bladder cancer.
