 Mitochondria called powerhouses cell. better understand role mitochondria maintaining regulating metabolism storage tissues, highly purified mitochondria isolated dormant potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum 'Folva') proteome investigated. Proteins resolved one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, tryptic peptides extracted gel slices analyzed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using Orbitrap XL. Using four different search programs, total 1,060 nonredundant proteins identified quantitative manner using normalized spectral counts including many 5-fold "extreme" proteins (low mass, high isoelectric point, hydrophobic) previous mitochondrial proteome studies. estimate compendium proteins represents high coverage potato tuber mitochondrial proteome (possibly high 85%). dynamic range protein expression spanned 1,800-fold included nearly components electron transport chain, tricarboxylic acid cycle, protein import apparatus. Additionally, identified 71 pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, 29 membrane carriers/transporters, number new proteins involved coenzyme biosynthesis iron metabolism, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, type 2C protein phosphatase may catalyze dephosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Systematic analysis prominent posttranslational modifications revealed 50% identified proteins harbor least one modification. prominently observed class posttranslational modifications oxidative modifications. study reveals approximately 500 new previously unconfirmed plant mitochondrial proteins outlines facile strategy unbiased, near-comprehensive identification mitochondrial proteins modified forms.
