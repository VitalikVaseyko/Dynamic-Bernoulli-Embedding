 pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) fundamental component cellular metabolism. PPP important maintain carbon homoeostasis, provide precursors nucleotide amino acid biosynthesis, provide reducing molecules anabolism, defeat oxidative stress. PPP shares reactions Entner-Doudoroff pathway Calvin cycle divides oxidative non-oxidative branch. oxidative branch highly active eukaryotes converts glucose 6-phosphate carbon dioxide, ribulose 5-phosphate NADPH. latter function critical maintain redox balance stress situations, cells proliferate rapidly, ageing, 'Warburg effect' cancer cells. non-oxidative branch instead virtually ubiquitous, metabolizes glycolytic intermediates fructose 6-phosphate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate well sedoheptulose sugars, yielding ribose 5-phosphate synthesis nucleic acids sugar phosphate precursors synthesis amino acids. Whereas oxidative PPP considered unidirectional, non-oxidative branch supply glycolysis intermediates derived ribose 5-phosphate vice versa, depending biochemical demand. functions require dynamic regulation PPP pathway achieved hierarchical interactions transcriptome, proteome metabolome. Consequently, biochemistry regulation pathway, still unresolved many cases, archetypal dynamics metabolic network cell. comprehensive article review seminal work led discovery description pathway date back 80 years, address recent results genetic metabolic mechanisms regulate activity. biochemical principles discussed context PPP deficiencies causing metabolic disease role pathway biotechnology, bacterial parasite infections, neurons, stem cell potency cancer metabolism.
