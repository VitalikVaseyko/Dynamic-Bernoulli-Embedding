 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms (PDK1-4) molecular switch down-regulates activity human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reversible phosphorylation. showed previously binding lipoyl domain 2 (L2) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex PDK3 induces "cross-tail" conformation PDK3, resulting opening active site cleft stimulation kinase activity. present study, report alanine substitutions Leu-140, Glu-170, Glu-179 L2 markedly reduce binding affinities L2 mutants PDK3. Unlike wildtype L2, binding L2 mutants PDK3 preferentially reduce affinity PDK3 ADP ATP. inefficient removal product inhibition associated ADP accounts decreased stimulation PDK3 activity L2 variants. Serial truncations PDK3 C-terminal tail region either impede abolish binding wild-type L2 PDK3 mutants, resulting reduction absence L2-enhanced kinase activity. Alanine substitutions residues Leu-27, Phe-32, Phe-35, Phe-48 lipoyl-binding pocket PDK3 similarly nullify L2 binding L2-stimulated PDK3 activity. results indicate residues L2 residues C-terminal region lipoyl-binding pocket PDK3 critical determinants cross-talk L2 PDK3, up-regulates PDK3 activity.
