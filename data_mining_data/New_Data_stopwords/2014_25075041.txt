 AIM: Abnormalities apoptotic signalling pathways often occur cancer cells limit successful chemotherapy outcomes cancers. Therefore, urgent need discover new anticancer agents novel mechanisms action overcome resistance effect chemotherapy. MATERIALS METHODS: present study, anticancer effects mechanisms action 17betaH-neriifolin (cardiac glycoside) evaluated terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay proteomic approach treated non-treated SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. RESULTS: 17betaH-neriifolin found active IC50 values 0.01 +/- 0.001 SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line, evaluated sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. RESULTS TUNEL assay indicated 17betaH-neriifolin caused apoptosis SKOV-3 cells dose-dependent manner. Based differential analysis treated non-treated SKOV-3 two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) profiles, four proteins, namely vimentin (VIM), pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1) transgelin (TAGLN1) identified involved apoptosis. proteins including piggybac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5), DENN/MADD domain containing 2D (DENND2D) formin-like 1(FMNL) also identified associated SKOV-3 cell death induced 17betaH-neriifolin. CONCLUSION: findings may provide new insights potential 17betaH-neriifolin's mechanism action killing ovarian cancer cells.
