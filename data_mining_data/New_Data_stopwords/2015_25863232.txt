 Imatinib mesylate (IM), tyrosine kinase inhibitor, used targeted cancer therapy. However, mono-targeting IM always achieve full tumor eradication thus recommended combine IM anticancer agents. Clotrimazole (CLT) antifungal azole derivative promising anticancer effects due inhibiting activity glycolytic enzymes. present study aimed evaluate effect combining CLT IM breast cancer cell line attempt establish effective new combination. T47D human breast cancer cell line treated different concentrations IM and/or CLT 48 h. IM-CLT interaction determined isobologram equation combination index. Cell viability confirmed measuring LDH activity. indicators glycolysis inhibition, expression hexokinase-2 (HK-2) 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) plus activity intracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) pyruvate kinase (PK) determined. addition, glucose consumption adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production measured. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) hypoxia inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) also determined modulators glycolysis. study demonstrated IM CLT synergistically inhibited cell growth T47D shown combination dose reduction indices. combination 15 muM IM 20 muM CLT significantly decreased glucose consumption, activity PK intracellular LDH, increased leaked LDH, VEGF medium compared drug alone. Furthermore combination decreased gene expression HK-2, PFK-1 ATP content compared control. conclusion, synergistic effect CLT IM cytotoxicity T47D cell line maybe mediated inhibition glycolysis increasing VEGF. studies required confirm efficiency safety combination.
