 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCKase) pyruvate kinase (PKase) measured Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown presence glycolytic gluconeogenic carbon sources. PEPCKase activity highest ethanol-grown cells. However, high PEPCKase activity also observed cells grown 1% glucose, especially compared activity sucrose-, maltose-, galactose-grown cells. Activity first detected 12 h glucose exhausted growth medium. PKase activity high glucose-grown cells; considerable activity also present ethanol- pyruvate-grown cells. absolute requirement respiration gluconeogenesis demonstrated absence significantly low levels PEPCKase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activities observed respiratory deficient mutants, well wild-type S. cerevisiae cells grown presence glucose antimycin chloramphenicol. Obligate glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes present simultaneously stationary phase cells, exponential phase cells; hence futile cycling could occur log phase cells regardless presence carbon source growth medium.
