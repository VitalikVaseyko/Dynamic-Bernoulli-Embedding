 Different isoenzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibit mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphorylation E1alpha subunit, thus contributing regulation glucose metabolism. positional cloning 7q21.3-q22.1 region linked insulin resistance non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus Pima Indians, identified gene encoding additional human PDK isoform, evidenced amino acid sequence identity (>65%) mammalian PDKs, confirmed biochemical analyses recombinant protein. performed detailed comparative analyses gene, termed PDK4, insulin-resistant insulin-sensitive Pima Indians, detected five DNA variants comparable frequencies subject groups. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, found variants identified promoter 5'-untranslated region correlate differences mRNA level skeletal muscle adipose tissue. conclude alterations PDK4 unlikely molecular basis underlying observed linkage 7q21.3-q22.1 Pima Indians. Information genomic organization promoter sequences PDK4 useful studies members family mitochondrial protein kinases important regulation glucose metabolism.
