 Potassium (K) required large quantities growing crops, faced high fertilizer prices, farmers often neglect K application favor nitrogen phosphorus. result, large areas farmland depleted K. K deficiency affects metabolite content crops negative consequences nutritional quality, mechanical stability, pathogen/pest resistance. Known functions K solute transport, protein synthesis, enzyme activation point close relationship K metabolism, unclear critical ones targeted biotechnological efforts improve K usage efficiency. identify metabolic targets signaling components K stress, adopted multilevel approach combining transcript profiles enzyme activities metabolite profiles Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants subjected low K K resupply. Roots shoots analyzed separately. results show regulation enzymes level transcripts proteins likely play important role plant adaptation K deficiency (1) maintaining carbon flux amino acids proteins, (2) decreasing negative metabolic charge, (3) increasing nitrogen-carbon ratio amino acids. However, changes transcripts enzyme activities explain strong reversible depletion pyruvate accumulation sugars observed roots low-K plants. propose primary cause metabolic disorders low-K plants resides direct inhibition pyruvate kinase activity low cytoplasmic K root cells.
