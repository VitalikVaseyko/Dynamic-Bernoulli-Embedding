 Ovarian cancer (OVCA) among lethal gynecological cancers leading high mortality rates among women. Increasing evidence indicate cancer cells undergo metabolic transformation tumorigenesis growth nutrients growth factors available tumor microenvironment. altered metabolic rewiring enhances tumor progression. Recent studies begun unravel role amino acids tumor microenvironment proliferation cancer cells. One critically important, yet often overlooked, component tumor growth metabolic reprogramming nitric oxide (NO) pathways cancer cells. Multiple lines evidence support link tumor growth cancers, including pancreas, breast ovarian. However, multifaceted role metabolism OVCA unclear direct demonstration NO's role modulating OVCA cells' metabolism lacking. study aims indentifying mechanistic links OVCA metabolism. uncover role modulating OVCA metabolism: positively regulates Warburg effect, postulates increased glycolysis along reduced mitochondrial activity aerobic conditions cancer cells. synthesis inhibition (using L-arginine deprivation, arginine substrate synthase (NOS), catalyzes synthesis; using L-Name, NOS inhibitor) donor (using DETA-NONOate) analysis, show positively regulates tumor growth also inhibits mitochondrial respiration OVCA cells, shifting cells towards glycolysis maintain ATP production. Additionally, led increase TCA cycle flux glutaminolysis, suggesting decreases ROS levels increasing NADPH glutathione levels. results place central player metabolism OVCA cells. Understanding effects cancer cell metabolism lead development targeting drugs OVCAs.
