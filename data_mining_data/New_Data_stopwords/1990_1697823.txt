 174 serum ferritin assays 121 patients various haemolytic disorders performed. mean serum ferritin levels significantly increased disorders contrast healthy controls. highest serum ferritin levels found pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, moderate increase observed hereditary sphaerocytosis (HS) autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) massive haemolysis glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency. Mild elevation serum ferritin levels depicted paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), beta thalassaemia minor types haemoglobinopathies. range values associated degree haemolysis relation duration disease apparent cases. Highly significant differences serum ferritin levels splenectomized non-splenectomized patients HS serum ferritin levels patients AIHA massive haemolysis remission found. compared normal controls, significant increase serum ferritin levels observed even patients AIHA remission splenectomized patients HS. two patients PK deficiency levels exceeding 2,000 micrograms/l indicated manifest iron overload. reliability serum ferritin assay index iron stores haemolytic disorders discussed.
