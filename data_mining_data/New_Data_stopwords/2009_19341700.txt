 pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDC) key regulatory point cellular metabolism linking glycolysis citric acid cycle lipogenesis. Reversible phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme critical regulatory mechanism important point monitoring metabolic activity. directly determine regulation PDC phosphorylation, developed complete set phospho-antibodies three known phosphorylation sites E1 alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHE1alpha). demonstrate phospho-site specificity antibody variety cultured cells tissue extracts. addition, show sensitivity antibodies PDH activity using pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-specific inhibitor dichloroacetate. go use antibodies assess PDH phosphorylation patient suffering Leigh's syndrome. Finally, observe changes individual phosphorylation states following small molecule screen, demonstrating reagents useful monitoring phosphorylation PDHE1alpha and, therefore, overall metabolism disease state well response myriad physiological pharmacological stimuli.
