 Two classes inositol phosphoglycans implicated second messengers insulin, one activates pyruvate dehydrogenase contains D-chiroinositol, one inhibits cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase contains myoinositol. examined effects 3-day fast muscle contents inositols healthy humans. oral glucose tolerance test performed biopsy obtained quadriceps femoris muscle overnight fast 72-hour fast. 72-hour fast significantly increased plasma glucose (1.5- 2-fold) insulin (2- 4-fold) glucose ingestion versus values overnight fast, indicating manifestation peripheral insulin resistance. 72-hour fast resulted approximately 20% decrease muscle content D-chiroinositol (P < 0.02), change myoinositol content. data demonstrate fasting specifically decreases muscle content D-chiroinositol human muscle may contribute finding insulin-mediated activation pyruvate dehydrogenase attenuated short-term starvation.
