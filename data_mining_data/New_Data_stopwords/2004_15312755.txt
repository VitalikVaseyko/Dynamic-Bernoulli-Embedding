 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes irreversible oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate mitochondria. PDC activity regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle catalyzed specific kinases (PDK) phosphatases (PDP). study, regulatory mechanisms PDC examined skeletal muscle spontaneously diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat onset diabetes. Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rat used control. Plasma glucose insulin concentrations normal levels groups 8 weeks age significantly higher OLETF LETO rats 25 weeks age (1.2-fold glucose 15-fold insulin), indicating development diabetes former. Plasma free fatty acids 1.6-fold concentrated skeletal muscle PDC activity state significantly lower OLETF LETO rats ages, suggesting suppression pyruvate oxidation OLETF rats even onset diabetes. PDK activity abundance PDK isoform 4 protein well mRNA greater OLETF rats ages. Conversely, abundance PDP isoform 1 protein mRNA less OLETF LETO rats ages. results suggest concomitant greater PDK4 less PDP1 expression skeletal muscle OLETF rats onset diabetes responsible lowering PDC activity may related development diabetes mellitus.
