 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal role pathological processes. However, little information published regarding underlying functions mechanisms lncRNAs pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). novel lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 sense-cognate gene ZNF312B found highly expressed human PDAC tissues cell lines, associated disease progression predicts clinical outcome PDAC patients. note, bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assays RNA immunoprecipitation assays indicated FEZF1-AS1 may act endogenous sponge competing miR-107, thereby modulating derepression ZNF312B. Downregulation FEZF1-AS1 ZNF312B significantly inhibited proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion PDAC cells vitro, whereas miR-107 inhibitor abrogated effect dow-regulation FEZF1-AS1 ZNF312B reducing oncogenic capacities PDAC cells. addition, FEZF1-AS1/miR-107/ZNF312B axis-induced promotion PDAC cells proliferation appeared mediated modulation apoptosis G1-S checkpoint. Furthermore, downregulation FEZF1-AS1 repressed tumor growth mouse xenograft models. particular, results highlight contribution FEZF1-AS1/miR-107/ZNF312B axis Warburg effect maintenance PDAC cells. Collectively, findings demonstrate FEZF1-AS1/miR-107/ZNF312B axis regulatory network might provide potential new therapeutic strategy PDAC.
