 Plasma pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activity contains two major isoenzymes. "L" type originates liver (erythrocytes contain similar isoenzyme), "M" type predominantly skeletal muscle. diagnostic use pyruvate kinase index muscle leakage requires assay type. M-type-selective assay mixtures two isoenzymes devised, based differences L form higher Km phosphoenolpyruvate inhibited 95% high concentration ADP. relevant conditions assay examined reaction system optimized 30 degrees C. assay yields expected Km values type pyruvate kinase. apparent increase activity hemolysed plasma samples found derived leukocytes.
