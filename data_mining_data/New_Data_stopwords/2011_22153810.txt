 Warburg hypothesis states aggressive cancers obtain much adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolizing glucose directly lactic acid. result high tumor selectivity, 3-bromopyruvic acid (3-BrPA), well-known inhibitor energy metabolism, proposed specific anticancer agent. investigated effect 3-BrPA mouse model aggressive metastatic lymphoma. Epstein-Barr-virus-infected human Raji lymphoma cells lentivirally transfected green fluorescent protein luciferase incubated RPMI/fetal bovine serum, various concentrations 3-BrPA used determine LD50 vitro. total, 18 severely combined immunodeficient mice injected 1 million human Raji lymphoma cells via tail vein. Using bioluminescent imaging, tumor growth measured daily 12 days determine tumor burden. day 0 (start treatment), mice randomized. Six mice received 10 mg/kg 3-BrPA i.p. daily 7 days, 6 mice received 1 treatment day 0, 6 mice received control buffer. Tumor growth assessed daily day 0 day 7 using bioluminescent imaging. data normalized acquisition time (luminescence/second; L/s). Body weight measured daily determine toxicity 3-BrPA. LD50 Raji lymphoma cells exposed 3-BrPA vitro 11 muM extremely steep dose response curve. day 0, tumor activity medians group daily treatment 2131 L/s (244-12,725), 1-day dose 3095 L/s (523-9650) nontreated control group, 2997 L/s (1521-6911). mice treated daily dose 10 mg/kg 3-BrPa 7 days, significant reduction tumor activity found whole treatment period compared control mice (P = 0.0043 day 7). mice single treatment day 0, growth delay evident day 2 (P = 0.0152 day 2) rest observation period. manifestation toxicity daily administration 10 mg/kg 3-BrPA reduction body weight. Body weight day 0 17.22 g +/- 0.84 g treatment group 17.58 g +/- 0.86 g control group. Body weight day +6 15.02 g +/- 2.04 g treated group 19.4 g +/- 0.63 g control group. 3-BrPA demonstrated significant positive tumor response vitro vivo. This, knowledge, first report use 3-BrPA systemic tumor model. Based data, 3-BrPA holds promise treatment systemic metastatic cancers.
