 stereochemistry transcarboxylase-catalyzed carboxylation 3-fluoropyruvate studied using fluorine NMR unpurified reaction mixtures. product 3-fluorooxaloacetate trapped using malate dehydrogenase, 2R,3R diastereomer 3-fluoromalate formed. fluoromethyl group fluoropyruvate take deuterium label solvent reaction. results confirm extend obtained previously Walsh co-workers [Goldstein, J. A., Cheung, Y. F., Marletta, M. A., & Walsh, C. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 5567-5575] showing transcarboxylase specific one two prochiral hydrogens fluoropyruvate. Transcarboxylase, coupled malate dehydrogenase, used analyze samples chiral fluoropyruvate obtained dephosphorylation (Z)-fluorophosphoenolpyruvate D2O presence either pyruvate kinase enzyme Escherichia coli sugar transport systems. Analysis fluoromalate produced showed fluoroenolpyruvate deuterated opposite faces two enzymes: enzyme protonates (deuterates) fluoroenolpyruvate exclusively 2-re face pyruvate kinase mainly 2-si face. Fluoropyruvate carboxylated transcarboxylase absolute retention configuration.
