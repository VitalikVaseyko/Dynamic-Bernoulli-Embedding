 Successful preservation small bowel (SB) closely correlated maintenance cellular energetics. study designed assess ability modified UW solution supplemented buffer glucose facilitate ATP production cold storage. part A, rats SB (n = 4) flushed vascularly follows: Group 1, UW solution (control); Group 2, HUW solution (UW+90 mM histidine). Inclusion histidine resulted >3-fold increase buffering capacity pH range 7.4-6.8. Positive effects histidine ATP energy charge apparent 4-10h storage. Examination key regulatory enzyme, Phosphofructokinase (PFK), reflected sustained activation 1-4h HUW group only. part B, groups vascularly flushed follows: Group 1, HUW solution (control); Group 2, Group 1+20mM glucose; Group 3, Group 2+luminal flush. Elevated ATP total adenylates 2-10h Group 3 compared control direct consequence improved glycolytic activity. data supports hypothesis tissue energetics significantly improved cold storage using histidine-buffered UW solution supplemented carbohydrate substrate.
