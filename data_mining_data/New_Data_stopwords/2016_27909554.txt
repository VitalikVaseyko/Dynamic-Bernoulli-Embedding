 BACKGROUNG/OBJECTIVES: study performed investigate effects mechanisms action high maysin corn silk extract body weight fat deposition experimental animals. MATERIALS/METHODS: total 30 male C57BL/6J mice, 4-weeks-old, purchased divided three groups weight using randomized block design. normal-fat (NF) group received 7% fat (diet weight basis), high-fat (HF) group received 25% fat 0.5% cholesterol, high-fat corn silk (HFCS) group received high-fat diet high maysin corn silk extract 100 mg/kg body weight daily oral administration. Body weight body fat measured, mRNA expression levels proteins involved adipocyte differentiation, fat accumulation, fat synthesis, lipolysis, fat oxidation adipose tissue liver measured. RESULTS: experimental diet intake 8 weeks, body weight significantly lower HFCS group compared HF group (P < 0.05), kidney fat epididymal fat pad weights significantly lower HFCS group compared HF group (P < 0.05). HFCS group, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma1 (PPAR-gamma1), PPAR-gamma2 mRNA expression levels significantly reduced (P < 0.05) epididymal fat pad, whereas cluster differentiation 36, lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme-4, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 mRNA expression levels significantly decreased liver adipose tissues (P < 0.05). HFCS group, mRNA expression levels AMP-activated protein kinase, hormone-sensitive lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 elevated (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: concluded high maysin corn silk extract inhibits expression genes involved adipocyte differentiation, fat accumulation, fat synthesis well promotes expression genes involved lipolysis fat oxidation, inhibiting body fat accumulation body weight elevation experimental animals.
