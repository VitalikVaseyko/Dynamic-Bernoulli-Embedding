 One important functions phospholipase A2 release arachidonic acid membrane phospholipids synthesis biologically active eicosanoids. demonstrated laboratory vitamin E inhibits platelet phospholipase A2 dose-dependent manner. Rats fed 100 ppm 1000 ppm vitamin E diet exhibit diminished phospholipase A2 activity compared fed vitamin E-free diet. Addition vitamin E sonicated platelet suspension resulted suppression phospholipase A2 activity groups rats. order gain insight mechanism vitamin E inhibition platelet phospholipase A2, partially purified enzyme gel filtration chromatography. Enzyme activity localized soluble supernatant fraction high-speed spin. partially purified rat platelet phospholipase A2 absolute requirement Ca2+ inhibited various forms tocopherol. Tocol inhibited enzyme greater extent either D- DL-alpha-tocopherol, little effect DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate. results emphasize importance hydroxyl moiety chromanol vitamin E molecule inhibitory action, compared methyl groups absent tocol. inhibitory action vitamin E platelet phospholipase A2 suggests crucial function vitamin E regulating arachidonate release membrane phospholipids subsequent metabolism.
