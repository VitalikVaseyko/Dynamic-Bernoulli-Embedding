 study investigated effects mangosteen metabolic syndromes high-fat (HF) diet-fed mice underlying mechanisms related adipogenesis. Mangosteen-supplemented mice gained significantly less body weight, compared HF group. levels markedly elevated HF mice serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, free fatty acid; whereas levels significantly lower 200 mg/kg mangosteen extract-treated group. mangosteen extract modify high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, however, LDL-cholesterol lower HDL/LDL ratio higher (9.4 vs. 3.7 HF group). Furthermore, 200 mg/kg mangosteen treatment activated hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase Sirtuin 1 vivo system. Thus, results study suggest mangosteen extract exerts antiobesity effects regulating energy metabolism hepatic lipid homeostasis.
