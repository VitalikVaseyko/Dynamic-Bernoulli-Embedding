 Several excitatory amino acid ligands found potently inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation rat cultured cerebellar astrocytes: L-cysteine sulfinic acid (L-CSA) = L-aspartate > L-glutamate >/= glutamate uptake inhibitor, L-PDC. property reflect activation conventional glutamate receptors, since selective ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists NMDA, AMPA, kainate, well several mGlu receptor agonists [(1S,3R)-ACPD, (S)-DHPG, DCG-IV, L-AP4, L-quisqualate, L-CCG-I], without activity. addition, mGlu receptor antagonists, L-AP3, (S)-4CPG, Eglu, LY341495, (RS)-CPPG, (S)-MCPG failed reverse 30 microM glutamate-mediated inhibitory responses. L-PDC-mediated inhibition abolished addition enzyme glutamate-pyruvate transaminase. finding suggests effect L-PDC indirect mediated endogenously released L-glutamate. Interestingly, L-glutamate-mediated inhibitory responses resistant pertussis toxin, suggesting G(i)/G(o) type G proteins involved. However, inhibition protein kinase C (PKC, either via selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X chronic PMA treatment) augmented glutamate-mediated inhibitory responses. Although mGlu3 receptors (which negatively coupled adenylyl cyclase) expressed astrocyte populations, study Western blot analysis indicated receptor type expressed cerebellar astrocytes. therefore suggest cerebellar astrocytes express novel mGlu receptor, negatively coupled adenylyl cyclase, possesses atypical pharmacological profile.
