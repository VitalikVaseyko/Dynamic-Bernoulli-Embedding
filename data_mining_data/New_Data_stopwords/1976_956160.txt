 Depolymerization microtubules ATP-reassembly buffer permitted preparation GDPETNGTP. Incubation tubulin fraction 35 degrees ATP induced phosphorylation E-site GDP GTP, dephosphorylated microtubule assembly. Incubation GDPETNGTP phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40] also induced polymerization. Depolymerization microtubules GTP-reassembly buffer yielded GTPETNGTP, capable polymerizing microtubules even absence free GTP. presence 4 glycerol, GDPETNGTP assembled microtubules change bound nucleotides.
