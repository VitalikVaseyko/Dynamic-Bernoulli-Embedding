 Conventional enzymatic assays alcohol dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, enolase performed 96-well microtiter plates compared assays monitored 25-well nanoarrays. miniaturized reactions could performed maximum volumes 6.3-8 nL read conventional fluorescence microscope system equipped scientific grade CCD camera. Substrate cofactor already present inside wells presprayed, applied solution wells nanoarray shortly assays started. assays, commercially available enzymes enzymes present cell-free extracts used. Assays carried premixed nanoarrays gave results comparable performed presprayed nanoarrays. Enzyme activities determined nanoarrays using two different methods good agreement assays performed microtiter plates. Also, good correspondence found expected observed enzyme levels. short, enzymatic assays performed premixed particular presprayed nanoarrays promising low-volume low-reagent- sample-consuming alternative current methodology could find applications many different areas analytical chemistry.
