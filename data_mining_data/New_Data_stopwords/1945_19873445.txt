 1. means Warburg-Barcroft microrespirometer apparatus Warburg direct method, relative effect caffeine upon O(2) consumption fertilized egg Arbacia punctulata shown following concentrations sea water: 0.002 per cent (M/10,000), 0.004 per cent (M/5,000), 0.02 per cent (M/1,000), 0.1 per cent (M/200), 0.2 per cent (M/100), 0.5 per cent (M/40), 2 per cent (M/10). 2. comparison normal eggs (uninhibited, non-caffeine-treated controls), caffeine concentrations including greater 0.1 per cent (M/200) depressed average uptake approximately 25 61 per cent 3 hour period. number instances, typified Experiment 10, effective inhibitory concentration ranged 0.02 per cent (M/1,000) upward degree depression O(2) consumption ranged 10.6 per cent 60.6 per cent. 3. caffeine concentrations including 0.02 per cent (M/1,000) series used, resulted decreasing normal rate cleavage division fertilized Arbacia eggs. 4. higher concentrations (0.5 2 per cent) produced complete blockage cleavage process. 5. Complete cleavage inhibition noted O(2) uptake depressed 50 per cent normal controls. 6. O(2) consumption-time relationship data indicate average depression, O(2) consumption 3 hour period, ranging 25 per cent caffeine concentration 0.1 per cent 61 per cent inhibition concentration 2 per cent. 7. Concentrations less 0.1 per cent (certainly less 0.02 per cent) give variable results indicate significant effect. 8. inferred respiration data presented probable inhibition O(2) consumption fertilized Arbacia eggs due influence caffeine upon main (activity primary) pathway. observed certain similarities caffeine data degree inhibition accomplished sodium cyanide. Moreover, demonstrated cyanide probably acts cytochrome oxidase step cytochrome oxidase-cytochrome chain reactions constituting O(2) uptake phase respiratory metabolism. improbable, therefore, caffeine also may act upon cytochrome oxidase enzyme. 9. viewpoint environmental conditions influencing reproductive phenomena, interest caffeine affect normal metabolism zygote.
