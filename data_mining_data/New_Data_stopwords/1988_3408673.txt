 Eleven new cases red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency congenital haemolytic disease 10 unrelated Italian families characterized using methods recommended International Committee Standardization Haematology (ICSH). patients double heterozygotes PK gene. 10 variants designated PK 'Lecce,' 'Parma,' 'Verona,' 'Milano,' 'Soresina,' 'Macerata,' 'Sassari,' 'Genova,' 'Mantova' 'Brescia.' PK 'Sassari' associated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency two siblings. mutants displayed multiple biochemical abnormalities except PK 'Lecce' showed decreased red cell PK activity. relation found severity anaemia either residual PK activity specific biochemical enzyme abnormalities. Increased serum ferritin levels detected patients, suggesting need systematically monitoring iron status disease.
