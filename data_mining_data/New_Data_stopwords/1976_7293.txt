 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase requires two divalent cations per active site catalysis enolization pyruvate presence adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). One divalent cation bound directly enzyme forms second sphere complex bound ATP (site 1). second divalent cation directly coordinated phosphoryl groups ATP interact enzyme (site 2). essential role divalent cation site 1 shown requirement Mg2+ Mn2+ enolization pyruvate presence substitution inert Cr3+-ATP complex. rate detritiation pyruvate shows hyperbolic dependence Mn2+ concentration presence high concentrations enzyme Cr3+-ATP. dissociation constant Mn2+ pyruvate kinase-Mn2+-ATP-Cr3+-pyruvate complex 1.3 +/- 0.5 muM determined kinetics detritiation pyruvate parallel Mn2+ binding studies using electron paramagnetic resonance. essential role divalent cation site 2 shown sigmoidal dependence rate detritiation pyruvate Mn2+ concentration presence high concentrations enzyme ATP yielding dissociation constant 29 +/- 9 muM Mn2+ site 2. value similar dissociation constant binary Mn-ATP complex (14 +/- 6 muM) determined similar conditions. rate detritiation pyruvate proportional concentration pyruvate kinase-Mn2+-ATP-Mn2+-pyruvate complex, determined parellel kinetic binding studies. Variation nature divalent cation site 1 presence CrATP causes twofold change rate detritiation pyruvate correlate pKa metal-bound water. Variation nature divalent cation sites presence ATP causes sevenfold variation rate detritiation pyruvate correlates pKa metal-bound water. greater rate enolization observed CrATP fits correlation, indicating electrophilicity nucleotide bound metal (at site 2) determines rate enolization pyruvate.
