 1. pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphorylated completion [gamma-32P]ATP intrinsic kinase, three phosphorylation sites observed. amino acid sequences around sites were: sequence 1, Tyr-Gly-Met-Gly-Thr-Ser(P)-Val-Glu-Arg; sequence 2, Tyr-His-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asp-Pro-Gly-Val-Ser(P)-Tyr-Arg. 2. phosphorylated inactivation repetitive additions limiting quantities [gamma-32P]ATP, phosphate incorporated mainly (more 90%) Ser-5 sequence 2. Phosphorylation site thus results activation pyruvate dehydrogenase. 3. Ser-5 phosphorylated ATP enzyme incubated [gamma-32P]ATP, phosphorylation remaining sites occurred. Ser-12 sequence 2 phosphorylated twice rapidly Ser-6 sequence 1. 4. Incubation pyruvate dehydrogenase excess [gamma-32P]ATP termination phosphorylation 50% complete inactivation showed Ser-5 sequence 2 phosphorylated rapidly, also Ser-12 sequence 2 significantly (15% total) phosphorylated. Ser-6 sequence 1 contained 1% total P. 5. results suggest addition limiting amounts ATP produces primarily phosphorylation Ser-5 sequence 2 (inactivating site). also occurs incubation excess ATP complete inactivation occurs, greater occupancy sites also occurs treatment.
