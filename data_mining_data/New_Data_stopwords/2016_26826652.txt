 Oncogenic activation PI3K/Akt pathway known play important role promote glucose metabolism cancer cells. However, molecular mechanism PI3K/Akt signalling pathway promotes glucose utilisation cancer cells still well understood. recently shown oncogenic activation PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling lung adenocarcinoma important promoting localisation glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) plasma membrane. thus hypothesised effect constitutive activation PI3K/AKT signalling glucose metabolism mediated thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), known regulator GLUT1 plasma membrane localisation. Consistent previous studies, inhibition PI3K/Akt pathway decreased cellular glucose uptake. Furthermore, inhibition PI3K/Akt signalling non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines using clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resulted decrease GLUT1 membrane localisation. also observed inhibition PI3K/Akt pathway various cell lines, including NSCLC cells, resulted increase TXNIP expression. Importantly, knockdown TXNIP using siRNA NSCLC cells promoted GLUT1 localised plasma membrane reversed effect PI3K/Akt inhibitors. Together, results suggest oncogenic activation PI3K/Akt signalling promotes cellular glucose uptake, least part, regulation TXNIP expression. mechanism may contribute Warburg effect cancer cells.
