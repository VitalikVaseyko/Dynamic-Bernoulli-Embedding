 mathematical model glycolysis human erythrocytes presented takes account ATP-synthesis -consumption. set three differential equations describes steady states time-dependent changes metabolite concentrations blood storage conditions. given parameter combination general three stationary points system, one unstable. low ATP-need ATP-level relatively constant variations rate constant ATP-consuming processes. critical level energy consumption system breaks down. important role 2.3P2G-bypass erythrocytes action "energy buffer", wasting ATP case ATP-overproduction producing ATP case underproduction. parameter combination consistent data isolated enzymes found gives good agreement theoretical predictions measured metabolite concentrations. blood preservation conditions difference rates ATP-production -consumption important factor high ATP-level long periods.
