 Metabolism tumor tissue differs normal one intensity protein synthesis glycolysis. dimeric pyruvate kinase (PKM2) specific enzyme tumor glycolysis. aim study determine relationship activity PKM2 type stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). second objective compare expression PKM2 disease progression prognosis. studied 65 patients divided two groups: 45 patients lung cancer 20 non-cancer healthy subjects taken control. serum activity PKM2 assessed spectrophotometrically. found PKM2 activity greater, average, 136 % adenocarcinoma 126 % squamous cell carcinoma compared present control subjects. higher PKM2 activity associated Stage III cancer (p < 0.001). Sensitivity PKM2 cancer marker 79 % adenocarcinoma 81 % squamous cell carcinoma specificity 50 % cancer types. conclude PKM2 activity higher patients NSCLC healthy subjects. level PKM2 activity associated advanced stage cancer. Nonetheless, low specificity PKM2 assessment makes limited utility NSCLC diagnosis evaluation cancer progression.
