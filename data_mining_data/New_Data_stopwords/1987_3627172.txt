 comparison glucose catabolism juvenile adult liver flukes, Fasciola hepatica, showed adult cytosolic degradation glucose via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) important route, whereas freshly excysted juvenile large part degraded via pyruvate kinase (PK). However, also shown adult exclusively use PEPCK pathway, juvenile exclusively use PK pathway. juvenile forced anaerobic functioning produced propionate acetate like adult, imply switched pathways adult: pathway via PK remained important. Malic enzyme (NADP(H)-dependent) demonstrated present cytosol mitochondria juveniles adults. enzyme activities enable parasite use mixture malate pyruvate ratio substrate mitochondrial production propionate acetate. Pyruvate dismutation important anaerobically functioning juvenile, whereas adult malate major, mitochondrial substrate. pH profiles PK PEPCK showed pathway PEP metabolism PK/PEPCK branchpoint regulated pH. However, end products glucose breakdown dependent pH. development, liver fluke gradually forced anaerobic functioning. first, acidic end product favour partitioning PEP PK/PEPCK branchpoint towards malate formation. Later, lasting predominance PEPCK pathway occurs PK activity almost completely disappears.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
