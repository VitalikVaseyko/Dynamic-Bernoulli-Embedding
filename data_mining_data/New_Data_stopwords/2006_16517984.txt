 Tryptophan fluorescence used analyze binding ligands human pyruvate dehydrogenase isoform 2 (PDHK2) demonstrate effects ligand binding distal structure PDHK2 required binding inner lipoyl domain (L2) dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase. Ligand-altered binding PDHK2 L2 effects specific ligands PDHK2 oligomeric state characterized analytical ultracentrifugation. ATP, ADP, pyruvate markedly quenched tryptophan fluorescence PDHK2 gave maximum quenching/L0.5 estimates: approximately 53%/3 microM ATP; approximately 49%/15 microM ADP; approximately 71%/approximately 590 microM pyruvate. conversion Trp-383 phenylalanine completely removed ATP- ADP-induced quenching > = 80% absolute decrease fluorescence due pyruvate. W383F-PDHK2 mutant retained high catalytic activity. Pyruvate, added ADP, quenched Trp fluorescence L0.5 3.4 microM pyruvate, > = 150-fold lower concentration needed pyruvate alone. ADP-enhanced binding pyruvate maintained W383F-PDHK2. Binding PDHK2 dimer L2 enhanced L2 housed oligomeric structures, including glutathione S-transferase (GST)-L2 dimer, strengthened reduction lipoyl groups (GST-L2(red)) (Hiromasa Roche (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 33681-33693). Binding PDHK2 GST-L2(red) modestly hindered 200 microM level ATP ADP 5.0 mM pyruvate; marked change nearly complete prevention binding observed ATP ADP plus pyruvate 100 microM levels, conditions caused PDHK2 dimer associate tetramer. changes make major contributions synergistic inhibition PDHK2 activity ADP pyruvate. Ligand-induced changes interfere PDHK2 binding GST-L2(red) may involve release interdomain cross arm PDHK2 subunits Trp-383 plays critical anchoring role.
