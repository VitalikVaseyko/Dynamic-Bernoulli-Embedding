 Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) accumulate high glycerol levels avoid freezing subzero temperatures. Glyceroneogenesis activated low temperature occurs liver via branch glycolysis gluconeogenesis. study, carbohydrate liver transcript levels 21 genes potentially associated glycerol production assessed controlled warm cold transition. Smelt held 8 degrees C (warm smelt; non-glycerol accumulating) subjected controlled decrease water temperature 8 degrees 0 degrees C (cold smelt; glycerol accumulating) sampled end temperature decrease 1 mo later. cold smelt compared warm smelt, liver glycogen levels lower phosphoglucomutase transcript levels higher. Plasma glycerol levels higher increased time cold smelt; cold smelt, liver phosphofructokinase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase transcript levels increased time. findings imply glycerol production fueled glycogen degradation inhibition pyruvate oxidation serves channel metabolic flux toward glycerol opposed complete glycolysis. Plasma glucose liver glucose-6-phosphatase transcript levels higher. Lipoprotein lipase transcript levels higher, suggesting enhanced lipid breakdown fuel energy metabolism. Glutamine synthetase transcript levels higher, perhaps store nitrogen biosynthesis spring.
