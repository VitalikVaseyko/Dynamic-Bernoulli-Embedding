 Initial velocity product inhibition studies Mn2+-activated FDP-modified Mg2+-activated pyruvate kinase Concholepas concholepas, performed. Evidence presented show Mn2+-enzyme catalyzes ordered sequential mechanism, ADP first substrate pyruvate last product. results presented consistent random combination reactants FDP-modified Mg2+-activated enzyme formation dead-end complexes enzyme ADP-ATP enzyme-PEP-ATP.
