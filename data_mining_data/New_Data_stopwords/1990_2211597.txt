 Purified bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex used investigate effects monovalent cations alpha-ketoisovalerate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase inhibition thiamin pyrophosphate. Initial velocity patterns thiamin pyrophosphate inhibition consistent hyperbolic non-competitive hyperbolic uncompetitive inhibition various K+ concentrations 0 120 mM. Kis, Kid, Kin thiamin pyrophosphate range 0.009 5.1 microM range K+ concentrations tested. absence K+, 1 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate effect PDH kinase inhibition thiamin pyrophosphate, whereas presence 20 mM K+, alpha-ketoisovalerate stimulated PDH kinase activity almost 2-fold range 0-80 microM thiamin pyrophosphate. Half-maximal stimulation alpha-ketoisovalerate occurred 200 microM presence 100 microM thiamin pyrophosphate 20 mM K+. Similar less extensive changes occurred presence 100 microM thiamin pyrophosphate 1 mM NH4+. Initial velocity patterns PDH kinase inhibition thiamin pyrophosphate presence 2 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate mixed noncompetitive, alpha-ketoisovalerate increased Vm Km adenosine 5'-triphosphate presence inhibitor. presence thiamin pyrophosphate, PDH kinase remained stimulated chromatography Sephadex G-25 remove alpha-ketoisovalerate. results indicate acylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex alpha-ketoisovalerate results PDH kinase stimulation presence monovalent cations thiamin pyrophosphate.
