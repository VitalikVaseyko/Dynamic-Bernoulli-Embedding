 previous studies effects lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pigs focused body's immune response, reports paid attention body metabolism changes. better understand glucose metabolism changes skeletal muscle following LPS challenge clarify possible mechanism, 12 growing pigs employed. Animals treated either 2 ml saline 15 microg/kg BW LPS, samples collected 6 h later. glycolysis status mitochondrial function longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle pigs analyzed. results showed serum lactate content NADH content LD muscle significantly increased compared control group. glycolysis-related genes expression, well hexokinase, pyruvate kinase lactic dehydrogenase activity, LD muscle significantly higher compared control group. Mitochondrial complexes IV significantly increased, mitochondrial ATP concentration markedly decreased. Significantly increased calcium content mitochondria observed, endoplasm reticulum (ER) stress demonstrated present study. results showed LPS treatment markedly changes glucose metabolism mitochondrial function LD muscle pigs, increased calcium content induced ER stress possibly involved. results provide new clues clarifying metabolic diseases muscle induced LPS.
