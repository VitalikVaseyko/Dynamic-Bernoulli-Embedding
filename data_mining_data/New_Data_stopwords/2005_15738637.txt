 Impaired insulin receptor (IR) signaling leads insulin resistance type 2 diabetes mellitus. Several inhibitors IR tyrosine kinase activity recently described associated human insulin resistance. Among negative regulators, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) likely play pivotal role IR signaling. Transgenic studies revealed PTP1B TCPTP primary candidates IR animals finally dephosphorylated, suggesting PTPs also involved dephosphorylation IR. study, showed receptor-type PTPepsilon (PTP epsilonM) dephosphorylated IR rat primary hepatocytes tyrosines 972, 1158, 1162 1163 primary targets PTP epsilonM. Wild type well substrate-trapping DA forms PTPepsilonM suppressed phosphorylation IR downstream enzymes Akt, extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). also demonstrated PTPepsilonM suppressed insulin-induced glycogen synthesis inhibited insulin-induced suppression phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, adenovirally introduced PTPepsilonM also exhibited inhibitory activity suppression PEPCK expression mouse liver. results suggest PTPepsilonM negative regulator IR signaling involved insulin-induced glucose metabolism mainly direct dephosphorylation inactivation IR hepatocytes liver.
