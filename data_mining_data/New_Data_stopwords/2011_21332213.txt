 Highly invasive tumor cells characterized metabolic switch, known Warburg effect, "normal" oxidative phosphorylation increased glycolysis even sufficiently oxygenated conditions. dependence glycolysis also confers growth advantage cells present hypoxic regions tumor. One key enzymes involved glycolysis, muscle isoform lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A), overexpressed metastatic cancer cells linked vitality tumors hypoxia. enzyme may considered potential target new anticancer agents, since inhibition cuts cancer energetic anabolic supply, thus reducing metastatic invasive potential cancer cells. discovered new efficient N-hydroxyindole-based inhibitors LDH-A, isoform-selective (over LDH-B) competitive substrate (pyruvate) cofactor (NADH). antiproliferative activity compounds confirmed series cancer cell lines, proved particularly effective hypoxic conditions. Moreover, NMR experiments showed compounds able reduce glucose-to-lactate conversion inside cell.
