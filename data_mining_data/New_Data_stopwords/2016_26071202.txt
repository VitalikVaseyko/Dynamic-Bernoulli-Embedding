 Damaged mitochondria targeted degradation autophagy pathway known mitophagy. Despite efforts unravel mechanisms underlying mitophagy, aspects mitophagy regulation remain largely unknown. study, using cell-based fluorescence assay reflecting CCCP-induced mitophagy, screened cDNA expression library encoding mitochondrial proteins identified PDK4 mitophagy regulator. Ectopic expression PDK4 stimulated clearance mitochondrial proteins CCCP-induced mitophagy enhanced pyruvate levels cytosol mitochondria. Interestingly, mitochondrial degradation mitophagy efficient absence pyruvate. Pyruvate required PINK1 stabilization mitochondrial depolarization subsequent PARK2 translocation LC3 recruitment onto damaged mitochondria. pyruvate-mediated mitophagy affected OXPHOS cellular ATP levels, thus independent energy metabolism. Rather, pyruvate required interaction PINK1 TOMM20 CCCP condition. results suggest pyruvate required CCCP-induced PINK1/PARK2-mediated mitophagy.
