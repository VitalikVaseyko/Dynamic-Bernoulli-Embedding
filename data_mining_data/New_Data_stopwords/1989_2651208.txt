 Different doses glucagon glucagon-like peptide (GLP) isolated coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch tested vivo vitro juvenile coho chinook (O. tshawytscha) salmon. Results obtained suggest involvement peptides regulation plasma glucose, plasma fatty acids, liver glycogen, hepatic enzymes: glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase, triacylglycerol lipase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Metabolic effects enhanced summer either spring autumn. GLP less effective glucagon stimulating glycogenolysis vivo. Salmon glucagon, especially low concentrations, generally potent metabolically mammalian (porcine/bovine) glucagon. interaction glucagon-family peptides insulin seems different one described mammals: glucagon GLP either lowered plasma circulating levels insulin showed effect. time parr-smolt transformation GLP slightly elevate plasma insulin levels coho salmon.
