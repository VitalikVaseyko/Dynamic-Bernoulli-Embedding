 Feeding high concentrate (HC) diet widely used strategy supporting high milk yields, yet may cause certain metabolic disorders. study aimed investigate changes milk production hepatic metabolism goats fed different proportions concentrate diet 10 weeks. total, 12 mid-lactating goats randomly assigned HC diet (65% concentrate dry matter, n=6) low concentrate (LC) diet (35% concentrate dry matter, n=6). Compared LC, HC goats produced greater amounts volatile fatty acids produced milk milk lactose, fat protein (P<0.01). HC goats showed greater concentration ATP, NAD, plasma non-esterified fatty acids hepatic triglycerides LC goats (P<0.05). Real-time PCR results showed messenger RNA (mRNA) expression gluconeogenic genes, namely, glucose-6-phosphatase, pyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase significantly up-regulated accompanied greater gluconeogenic enzyme activities liver HC goats. Moreover, expression hepatic lipogenic genes including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, fatty acid synthase diacylglycerol acyltransferase mRNA also up-regulated HC diet (P<0.05). HC goats greater hepatic phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase LC (P<0.05). Furthermore, histone-3-lysine-27-acetylation contributed elevation gluconeogenic gene expression. results indicate lactating goats fed HC diet 10 weeks produced milk, associated up-regulated gene expression enzyme activities involved hepatic gluconeogenesis lipogenesis.
