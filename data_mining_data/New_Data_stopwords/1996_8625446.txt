 study supports existence pluripotent liver stem cell population potential differentiate hepatocytes bile ductular cells. compared expression hepatocyte-specific bile ductular-specific markers fetal preneoplastic rat liver. L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) alpha glutathione S-transferase (GST) used adult hepatocyte-specific markers, cytokeratin 19 (CK19) used bile ductular-specific marker. pi GST M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), fetal hepatocyte-specific expressed high levels oval duct-like cells, also used. characterized fetal liver derived 13-21 days gestation (E13-E21). pi GST detected E18 hepatoblasts, form intrahepatic bile ducts, CK19 detected E19. cells express alpha GST L-PK E19 E21. Oval, duct-like bile ductular cells rats treated choline-deficient diet containing 0.07% ethionine (CDE diet) 8 weeks characterized double immunocytochemistry. L-PK alpha GST absent bile ductular cells normal adult liver 3 weeks CDE treatment. 4-5 weeks CDE treatment, majority bile ductular cells express L-PK, 6 weeks co-express L-PK alpha GST. two populations oval cells, major population expressing fetal hepatocyte markers, minor population expresses fetal hepatocyte, adult hepatocyte bile ductular markers. least three different duct-like cell populations co-express different markers characteristics fetal hepatocytes sequential stages differentiation. One population co-expresses pi GST M2-PK similar fetal hepatocytes derived E13-E14 fetuses. second expresses two fetal markers L-PK, reflects characteristics E15 hepatocytes. third expresses pi GST, M2-PK, L-PK alpha GST characteristic E16-E19 hepatocytes. Upon withdrawal CDE diet, autoradiography using tritiated thymidine shows oval duct-like cells differentiate hepatocytes. study demonstrates oval duct-like cells express hepatocytic bile ductular markers, capacity differentiate hepatocytes, characteristics similar hepatoblasts developing rat liver.
