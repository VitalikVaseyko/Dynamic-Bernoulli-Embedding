 Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake muscle depressed high-fat-sucrose (HFS) feeding rats. investigate mechanism insulin resistance, vivo activation insulin receptor kinase liver muscle control HFS-fed rats determined. Rats injected glucose insulin killed 0, 5, 15, 30 min injection. Insulin binding changed partially purified receptors muscle HFS rats. control rats insulin receptor kinase activity maximally stimulated threefold liver 5 min fourfold muscle 15 min insulin-glucose injection. insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity receptors isolated liver rats fed HFS diet decreased 30% comparison controls. contrast, receptors isolated muscle show difference basal insulin-stimulated kinase activity HFS-fed control rats. Decreased vivo activation insulin receptor kinase may least partially responsible insulin resistance liver. insulin binding insulin stimulation receptor kinase normal muscle HFS-fed animals, concluded insulin resistance glucose uptake muscle caused defect distal insulin receptor.
