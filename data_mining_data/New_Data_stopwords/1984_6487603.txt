 true substrate pyruvate kinase catalyzed phosphorylation hydroxylamine high pH activated bicarbonate shown N-hydroxycarbamate, since lag seen reaction started addition bicarbonate hydroxylamine burst appears started mixture two. lag diminished addition carbonic anhydrase eliminated, showing CO2 intermediate formation carbamate formation CO2 subsequent reaction CO2 hydroxylamine limit rate carbamate formation. equilibrium constant reaction bicarbonate + hydroxylamine reversed N-hydroxycarbamate 1.33 M-1. product phosphorylation decomposes loss CO2 O-phosphorylhydroxylamine, stable 25 degrees C pH 3 11 pK2 = 5.63 phosphate pK3 = 10.26 amino group.
