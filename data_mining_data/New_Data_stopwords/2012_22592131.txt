 aim present study investigate participation sympathetic nervous system (SNS) control glycerol-3-P (G3P) generating pathways white adipose tissue (WAT) rats three situations plasma insulin levels low. WAT 48 h fasted animals, 3 day-streptozotocin diabetic animals high-protein, carbohydrate-free (HP) diet-fed rats surgical denervated G3P generation pathways evaluated. Food deprivation, diabetes HP diet provoke marked decrease rate glucose uptake glycerokinase (GyK) activity, significant increase glyceroneogenesis, estimated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity incorporation 1-[(14)C]-pyruvate glycerol-TAG. denervation provokes reduction (~70%) NE content WAT fasted, diabetic HP diet-fed rats. denervation induced increase WAT glucose uptake fed, fasted, diabetic HP diet-fed rats (40%, 60%, 3.2 fold 35%, respectively). TAG-glycerol synthesis pyruvate reduced denervation adipocytes fed (58%) fasted (36%), saline-treated (58%) diabetic (23%), HP diet-fed rats (11%). groups denervation reduced PEPCK mRNA expression (75%-95%) PEPCK activity (35%-60%). denervation caused ~35% decrease GyK activity control rats ~35% reduction already low enzyme activity fasted, diabetic HP diet-fed rats. data suggest SNS plays important role modulating G3P generating pathways WAT, situations insulin levels low.
