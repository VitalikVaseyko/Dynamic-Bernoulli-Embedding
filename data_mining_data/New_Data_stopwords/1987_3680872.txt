 demonstrated young RBCs (reticulocytes early mature erythrocytes) possess insulin receptors old RBCs (late mature erythrocytes) yet known whether insulin receptors young old RBCs regulated similarly. present investigation insulin receptors young old RBCs have, therefore, studied five normal male subjects 2 days dexamethasone ingestion (0.5 mg tablet every 6 h) and, subjects, 5 h ingestion 75 g glucose. results obtained clearly demonstrate dexamethasone increases insulin receptor concentration glucose ingestion increases insulin receptor affinity concentration young RBCs. contrast, neither stimuli modify insulin receptors old RBCs. Studies RBCs usually performed whole RBC population taking account differential responsiveness receptors young versus old RBCs; consequently, phenomenon might responsible fact data reported RBCs agreement reported monocytes adipocytes taken consideration using RBCs evaluate insulin receptor regulation.
