 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Beta cells situated islet Langerhans respond vigorously glucose dissociated beta cells. Mechanisms discrepancy studied comparing insulin-producing MIN6 cells aggregated pseudoislets MIN6 monolayer cells mouse human islets. METHODS: MIN6 monolayers, pseudoislets mouse human islets exposed glucose, alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), pyruvate, KIC plus glutamine phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 wortmannin. Insulin secretion (ELISA), cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]c; microfluorometry), glucose oxidation (radiolabelling), expression genes involved mitochondrial metabolism (PCR) phosphorylation insulin receptor signalling proteins (western blotting) measured. RESULTS: Insulin secretory responses glucose, pyruvate, KIC glutamine higher pseudoislets monolayers comparable human islets. Glucose oxidation genes mitochondrial metabolism upregulated pseudoislets compared single cells monolayers, respectively. Phosphorylation inhibitory S636/639 site IRS-1 significantly higher monolayers dispersed human mouse cells pseudoislets intact human mouse islets. PI3K inhibition slightly attenuated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion monolayers, substantially reduced pseudoislets human mouse islets without suppressing glucose-induced [Ca(2+)]c response. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: propose islet architecture critical proper beta cell mitochondrial metabolism IRS-1 signalling, PI3K regulates insulin secretion step distal elevation [Ca(2+)]c.
