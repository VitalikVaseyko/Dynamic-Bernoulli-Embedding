 Three novel splice site mutations two novel missense mutations identified molecular analysis pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency associated hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Nepalese PK variant, PK Kowloon, found homozygous transversion 5'-splice site seventh intervening sequence (IVS) L-type PK gene (Ivs7[+1]gt --> tt). Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, showed R-type PK mRNA proband's reticulocytes included seventh IVS seventh eighth exon, introducing stop codon 3 nucleotides downstream mutated site. Consequently, translational product may lack 44% R-PK polypeptide. transition last nucleotide exon 9 (1269GCG --> GCA) found Japanese PK variant, PK 'Kamata.' mutation alter amino acid sequence, caused skipping ninth exonic sequence R-PK transcripts. result, affected R-type PK lost 51 amino acid residues (373Met-423Ala del). transversion splice acceptor site third IVS (Ivs 3[-2]ag --> tg) identified PK 'Aomori.' mutation resulted aberrant splicing cryptic splice site within exon 4, causing deletion two codons aberrant R-PK transcript (95 Gly-96 Pro --> del). PK 'Kamata' PK 'Aomori' missense mutation allele, 1044AAG --> AAT (348Lys --> Asn) 1075CGC --> TGC (359Arg --> Cys), respectively. Although 348Lys 359Arg located sixth loop domain (beta/alpha)8 barrel, shown contain substrate cation binding sites, degree anemia much severe PK 'Kamata' PK 'Aomori,' possibly 51 amino acid deletion PK 'Kamata' 2 amino-acid deletion PK 'Aomori' may abolish PK catalytic activity.
