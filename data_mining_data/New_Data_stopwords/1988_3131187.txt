 response added catecholamines, isolated trout (Salmo gairdneri) hepatocytes substantially increase output glucose surrounding medium. effect due activation glycogen breakdown concomitant increases gluconeogenesis cell respiration. metabolic parameter activated similar extent. hormone-treated untreated cells, glycogenolysis accounts 97% glucose production. Activation glycogen phosphorylase implicated degradation cell glycogen, increased flux gluconeogenic pathway lactate associated inactivation pyruvate kinase, possibly enzyme phosphorylation indicated activity ratio measured low saturating concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate. studies specific adrenergic agonists antagonists, conclude stimulation glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis trout hepatocytes consistent beta-adrenergic effect. Results inconclusive respect catecholamine-mediated activation cell respiration. None monitored cell acid-base variables (pH, PCO2, [HCO3-]) implicated catecholamine-dependent changes metabolic output hepatocytes. Imposed hypercapnic conditions (increased medium PCO2 decreased medium pH), cause changes cell acid-base parameters, result depression lactate oxidation gluconeogenesis, rate glycogenolysis affected. addition, total amounts glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate kinase assayable negatively affected hypercapnic treatment hepatocytes. hypercapnic conditions, cells highly responsive adrenergic agonists. appears that--especially long term--the catecholamine-dependent activation gluconeogenesis may compensate acid-base-dependent shortfall glucose output liver.
