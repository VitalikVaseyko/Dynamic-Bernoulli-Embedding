Experiments performed 1-60 days injection showed activity three enzymes gradually decreased (day 4-5), reached maximum fall (day 10-25), subsequently returned control values (day 30-60). Concomitantly enzymatic alterations, muscles showed fibrillation ACh hypersensitivity; however, contrast denervation, drug effect nerve conduction, effective neuromuscular transmission, ultrastructure motor end plates. Experiments [3H]colchicine indicated observed changes brought drug acting directly motor axons rather muscle cells. transsynaptic effects induced colchicine treatment nerve ascribed temporary interruption axoplasmic transport. suggested neurotrophic regulation muscle-soluble enzymes partly depend normal operation axoplasmic transport system.
