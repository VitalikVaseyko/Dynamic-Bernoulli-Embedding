 Neuronal cells usually utilize glucose principal metabolic fuel monocarboxylates including lactate pyruvate alternative energetic substrates central nervous system. present study, investigated synaptic utilization lactate/pyruvate hippocampal slices adult aged guinea pig brains. Synaptic activity estimated terms amplitude field population spikes (PS) recorded granular cell layer hippocampal dentate gyrus. Replacement extracellular glucose lactate suppressed synaptic activity, followed spontaneous recovery PS amplitudes slices 3-4-weeks old guinea pigs. presence chelerythrine, inhibitor protein kinase C (PKC), substitution lactate glucose maintain synaptic activity. contrast, application H-89 lavendustin A. inhibitors cAMP-dependent protein kinase tyrosine kinase, respectively, influence synaptic utilization lactate. hippocampal dentate gyrus 24-months old guinea pigs, extracellular lactate sustain synaptic function. results indicate PKC-dependent metabolic process involved synaptic utilization lactate adult brain, lactate metabolism synapse impaired aged brain.
