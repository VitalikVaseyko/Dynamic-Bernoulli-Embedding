 BACKGROUND: Elevated serum concentrations M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) correlate poor prognosis patients pancreaticobiliary duodenal cancer, expression M2-PK formalin-fixed pancreatic tissue unknown. aimed characterise immunohistochemical expression M2-PK archived specimens pancreaticobiliary duodenal cancers, premalignant lesions, chronic pancreatitis, normal pancreas. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining performed mouse anti-M2-PK monoclonal antibody (clone DF-4) optimal dilution 1:25 tissue microarrays constructed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue 126 consecutive patients undergoing pancreatic resections June 2001 June 2006. 104 underwent resection cancer 22 chronic pancreatitis. 78 specimens chronic pancreatitis tissue obtained adjacent areas cancer. Normal pancreatic tissue obtained resection specimens total 30 patients. Metastatic tumours 61 regional lymph nodes 61 patients also studied. 11 premalignant pancreaticobiliary duodenal lesions studied. M2-PK expression quantified immunohistochemical score (IHS; Range 0-12). RESULTS: Benign non-ductal tissue chronic pancreatitis normal pancreas showed variable expression M2-PK (IHS = 1 25%, IHS = 2-3 40%, IHS>3 40%). Benign pancreatic ductal epithelium, primary pancreaticobiliary duodenal premalignant lesions cancers (and lymph node metastasis) showed complete lack expression (IHS = 0). CONCLUSION: Complete lack M2-PK expression observed benign pancreatic ducts, premalignant lesions cancer. M2-PK present benign non-ductal epithelium normal pancreas peri-tumoural tissue.
