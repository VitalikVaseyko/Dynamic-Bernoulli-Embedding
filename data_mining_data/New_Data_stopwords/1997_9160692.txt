 studied PK-LR gene 15 unrelated Italian patients congenital hemolytic anemia associated erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Fourteen different mutations detected among 26 mutated alleles identified: five-nucleotide (nt) deletion (227 231), two splice-site (1269C IVS3(-2)c), 10 missense (514C, 787T, 823A, 993A, 994A, 1168A, 1456T, 1529A, 1552A, 1594T) one nonsense mutation(s) (721T). Eight (deletion 227-231, 1269C, IVS3(-2)c, 514C, 787T, 823A, 1168A, 1552A) novel. Moreover, new polymorphic site detected 3' untranslated region mRNA (C/T, nucleotide 1738). deletion 227-231 causes stop codon amino acid 77, probably resulting unstable gene product. Mutations 1269C IVS3(-2)c lead alteration 5' 3' splice-site consensus sequence, respectively; cDNA analysis failed reveal abnormal transcript, suggesting mutations generate unstable mRNA rapidly degraded. five new missense mutations, 823A (Gly275-Arg) 1168A (Asp390-Asn) involve highly conserved amino acids, 514C (Glu172-Gln) 1552A (Arg518-Ser), although found less conserved regions, affect balance electric charges protein. Mutation 787T (Gly263-Trp) likely determine strong modifications local structure molecule. frequent mutation Italy appears 1456T (seven 30 alleles), followed 1529A (three 30) 994A (three 30). correlation found mutations, biochemical characteristics enzyme, clinical course disease.
