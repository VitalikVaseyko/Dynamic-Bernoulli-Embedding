 Cancer metabolism emerging chemotherapeutic target. Enhanced glycolysis suppression mitochondrial metabolism characterize Warburg phenotype cancer cells. flux respiratory substrates, ADP, Pi mitochondria release mitochondrial ATP cytosol occur voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) located mitochondrial outer membrane. Catabolism respiratory substrates Krebs cycle generates NADH FADH2 enter electron transport chain (ETC) generate proton motive force maintains mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) utilized generate ATP. ETC also major cellular source mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). alphabeta-Tubulin heterodimers decrease VDAC conductance lipid bilayers. High constitutive levels cytosolic free tubulin intact cancer cells close VDAC decreasing mitochondrial DeltaPsi mitochondrial metabolism. VDAC-tubulin interaction regulates VDAC opening globally controls mitochondrial metabolism, ROS formation, intracellular flow energy. Erastin, VDAC-binding molecule lethal cancer cell types, erastin-like compounds identified high-throughput screening antagonize inhibitory effect tubulin VDAC. Reversal tubulin inhibition VDAC increases VDAC conductance flux metabolites mitochondria. VDAC opening promotes higher mitochondrial DeltaPsi global increase mitochondrial metabolism leading high cytosolic ATP/ADP ratios inhibit glycolysis. VDAC opening also increases ROS production causing oxidative stress that, turn, leads mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic failure, cell death. summary, antagonism VDAC-tubulin interaction promotes cell death "double-hit model" characterized reversion proproliferative Warburg phenotype (anti-Warburg) promotion oxidative stress.
