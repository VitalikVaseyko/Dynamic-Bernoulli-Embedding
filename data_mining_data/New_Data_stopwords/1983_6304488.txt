 Hepatic pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity assayed native conditions, Sephadex G-25 filtered extracts rat hepatocytes, measuring reactivation rate glucagon-inactivated pyruvate kinase-L. ionic requirements reaction, well possible regulatory role pyruvate kinase ligands, investigated. Pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity dependent divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+ Co2+). Mg2+ ions highly enhanced reactivation rate pyruvate kinase, presence 100 mM KF inhibited process. Physiological concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibited pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity. inhibitory effects partially antagonized presence L-alanine. results suggest ligands pyruvate kinase could play role control pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity(ies), possibly modifying conformational state substrate protein.
