 Isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles rat exposed atmospheres 30% CO2 (high-CO2 muscles) 6.5% CO2 (control muscles) O2 95 min. Muscle contraction characteristics studied incubation. Tetanic tension decreased high-CO2 muscles 55% initial value remained unchanged control muscles. Relaxation time prolonged high-CO2 muscles control muscles. Intracellular pH 6.67 +/- 0.04 (SD) high-CO2 muscles 7.01 +/- 0.04 control muscles. CO2-induced acidosis marked influence intermediary energy metabolism shown fourfold increase glucose 6-phosphate, 14% increase ADP, decrease phosphocreatine 44% control value. Lactate pyruvate contents unchanged. observed metabolic changes explained effect H+ activity phosphofructokinase creatine kinase equilibrium. concluded H+ concentration causes muscular fatigue. is, however, uncertain whether effect increased H+ per se high-energy phosphate depletion induced acidosis.
