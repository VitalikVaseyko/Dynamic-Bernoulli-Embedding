 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key enzyme glycolysis highly expressed many tumor cells, plays important role Warburg effect. previous study, found PIM2 phosphorylates PKM2 Thr454 residue (Yu, etl 2013). However, functions PKM2 Thr454 modification cancer cells still remain unclear. find PKM2 translocates nucleus Thr454 phosphorylation. Replacement wild type PKM2 mutant (T454A) enhances mitochondrial respiration, decreases pentose phosphate pathway, enhances chemosensitivity A549 cells. addition, mutant (T454A) PKM2 reduces xenograft tumor growth nude mice. findings demonstrate PKM2 T454 phosphorylation potential therapeutic target lung cancer.
