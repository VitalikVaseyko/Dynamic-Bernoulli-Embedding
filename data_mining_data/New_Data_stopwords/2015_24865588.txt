 Severe influenza characterized cytokine storm multiorgan failure metabolic energy disorders vascular hyperpermeability. regulation energy homeostasis, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex plays important role catalyzing oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate, linking glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle fatty acid synthesis, thus activity linked energy homeostasis. present study tested effects diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA), new PDH kinase 4 (PDK4) inhibitor, mice severe influenza. Infection mice influenza PR/8/34(H1N1) virus resulted marked down-regulation PDH activity ATP level, selective up-regulation PDK4 skeletal muscles, heart, liver lungs. Oral administration DADA 12-h intervals 14 days starting immediately infection significantly restored PDH activity ATP level various organs, ameliorated disorders glucose lipid metabolism blood, together marked improvement survival suppression cytokine storm, trypsin up-regulation viral replication. results indicate PDK4 inhibition, DADA effectively suppresses host metabolic disorder-cytokine cycle, closely linked influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin cycle, resulting prevention multiorgan failure severe influenza.
