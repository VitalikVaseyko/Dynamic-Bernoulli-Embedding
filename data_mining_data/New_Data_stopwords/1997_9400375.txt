 Recent findings suggest high glucose levels may promote atherosclerosis coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). explore intracellular mechanisms action troglitazone affects process, examined effect troglitazone migration growth characteristics cultured rabbit coronary VSMCs. Treatment chronic high glucose medium (22.2 mmol/L) 5 days increased VSMC migration 92%, [3H]thymidine incorporation 135%, cell number 32% compared VSMCs treated normal glucose (5.5 mmol/L glucose + 16.6 mmol/L mannose) medium. Trolitazone 100 nmol/L 1 mumol/L significantly suppressed high glucose-induced VSMC migration 34% 42%, respectively, proliferative effect (as measured cell number) 17% 27%, [3H]thymidine incorporation 45% 60% (n = 6, P < .05). high glucose-induced impairment insulin-mediated [3H]deoxyglucose uptake blocked protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (calphostin C, 1 mumol/L) also improved troglitazone without change insulin receptor number affinity. high glucose-induced insulin-mediated increase cell number [3H]thymidine incorporation suppressed troglitazone. Troglitazone (1 mumol/L) also suppressed high glucose-induced phospholipase activation, elevation cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio (as measured cytosolic ratio lactate/pyruvate), membrane-bound PKC activation. Flow cytometric DNA histogram analysis cell cycle stage showed high glucose-induced increase percentage cells phase suppressed 1 mumol/L troglitazone. findings suggest PKC may link impairment insulin-mediated glucose uptake increase migration proliferation induced high glucose levels troglitazone may clinically useful treatment high glucose-induced coronary atherosclerosis.
