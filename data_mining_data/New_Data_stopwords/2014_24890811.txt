 Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Emerging evidence shown long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act key regulators multiple cancers. However, remains largely unexplored whether lncRNA regulates glucose metabolism cancer cells. study, show lncRNA UCA1 promotes glycolysis bladder cancer cells, UCA1-induced hexokinase 2 (HK2) functions important mediator process. show UCA1 activates mTOR regulate HK2 activation STAT3 repression microRNA143. Taken together, findings provide first evidence UCA1 plays positive role cancer cell glucose metabolism cascade mTOR-STAT3/microRNA143-HK2, reveal novel link lncRNA altered glucose metabolism cancer cells.
