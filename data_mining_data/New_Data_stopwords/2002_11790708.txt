 BACKGROUND: Chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (CH-PHT) associated suppressed expression function voltage-gated K(+) channels (Kv) pulmonary artery (PA) smooth muscle cells (SMCs) shift cellular redox balance toward reduced state. hypothesized dichloroacetate (DCA), metabolic modulator shift redox balance toward oxidized state increase Kv current myocardial cells, would reverse CH-PHT. METHODS RESULTS: studied 4 groups rats: normoxic, normoxic+DCA (DCA 70 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) PO), chronically hypoxic (CH), CH+DCA. CH CH+DCA rats kept hypoxic chamber (10% FiO(2)) 2 3 weeks. DCA given either day 1 prevent day 10 reverse CH-PHT. used micromanometer-tipped catheters measured hemodynamics closed-chest rats days 14 18. CH+DCA rats significantly reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular hypertrophy, PA remodeling compared CH rats. CH inhibited I(K), eliminated acute hypoxia-sensitive I(K), decreased Kv2.1 channel expression. short term, low-dose DCA (1 micromol/L) increased I(K) CH-PASMCs. mammalian expression system, DCA activated Kv2.1 tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. given long-term, DCA partially restored I(K) Kv2.1 expression PASMCs without altering right ventricular pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, suggesting beneficial effects DCA occur nonmetabolic mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: DCA prevents reverses CH-PHT mechanism involving restoration expression function Kv channels. DCA previously used humans may potentially therapeutic agent pulmonary hypertension.
