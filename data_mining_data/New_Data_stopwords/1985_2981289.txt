 Various regulators protein kinase activities tested effects vitro transfer phosphate [gamma-32P]ATP four proteins rat brain synaptic particulate preparations. One protein, apparent molecular weight 44,000, accepted 32P presence 8 mM EDTA added Mg2+. major phosphoprotein brain mitochondria. phosphorylation inhibited pyruvate stimulated K+, comigrated electrophoretic gels authentic alpha-subunit pyruvate: lipoamide oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) (EC 1.2.4.1) bovine heart. major kinase acting three proteins apparent molecular weights 24,000, 21,000, 19,000 stimulated Ca2+, preincubation phospholipase C, 12-tetradecanoyl 4-beta-phorbol 13-acetate. Phosphorylation lower-molecular-weight proteins inhibited ACTH1-24, cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate, 50 microM trifluoperazine. stimulatory effect Ca2+ antagonized calmodulin. kinase question appears B-50 protein kinase protein kinase C.
