 Alzheimer's disease characterized senile plaque neurofibrillary tangle brain. However, relation etiology disease left unclear. Recently clarified neurofibrillary tangle consists highly phosphorylated tau protein. started identify enzyme(s) responsible phosphorylation obtained tau protein kinase II. Tau protein kinase phosphorylated tau protein also pyruvate dehydrogenase, phosphorylation caused inactivation enzyme finally led cell death. proved TPKI upregulated AD brain control brain. Upregulation TPKI induced treating neuronal cells Abeta protein. Finally identified oligomeric aggregation Abeta protein named Amylospheroid highly potent degenerate neuronal cells vitro vivo systems.
