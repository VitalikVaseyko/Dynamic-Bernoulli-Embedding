 Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical cystic fibrosis isolate CHA mutagenized Tn5Tc identify new genes involved type III secretion system (TTSS)-dependent cytotoxicity toward human polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Among 25 mutants affected TTSS function, 14 contained insertion different positions aceAB operon encoding PDH-E1 -E2 subunits pyruvate dehydrogenase. PDH mutants, transcriptional activation TTSS genes response calcium depletion occurred. Expression trans ExsA restored TTSS function cytotoxicity.
