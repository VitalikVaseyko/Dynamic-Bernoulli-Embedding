 describe paper method studying transient gene expression primary culture adult rat hepatocytes. isolation collagenase perfusion, hepatocytes monolayer transfected foreign DNA calcium phosphate precipitation technique first 24 hours plating. transfected plasmid containing gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase driven early promoter simian virus 40, hepatocytes reproducibly expressed high levels chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT); transient expression much higher obtained rat hepatoma cell line H4II. Different medium conditions tested; optimal level CAT activity obtained using serum-free, hormonally defined medium. Using techniques, investigated expression liver-specific genes transferred hepatocytes. show L-pyruvate kinase promoter active hepatocytes silent fibroblasts. Moreover, use serum-free medium may allow investigation role hormones nutrients cells respond normally effectors.
