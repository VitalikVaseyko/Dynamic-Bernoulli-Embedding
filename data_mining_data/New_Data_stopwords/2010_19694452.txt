 use iTRAQ labeling mass spectrometry LTQ-Orbitrap HCD capability, assessed relative changes protein phosphorylation mitochondria upon physiological perturbation. reference reaction, monitored well-characterized regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase/pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase response dichloroacetate, de-energization Ca2+. Relative quantification phosphopeptides PDH-E1alpha subunit porcine heart revealed dephosphorylation three serine sites (Ser231, Ser292 Ser299). Dephosphorylation Ser292 (i.e., inhibitory site) DCA correlated activation PDH activity previously reported, consistent de-energization data. Calcium also dephosphorylated (i.e., activated) PDH, thus, confirming calcium activation PDP. approach, successfully monitored phosphorylation sites mitochondrial proteins including adenine nucleotide translocase, malate dehydrogenase mitochondrial creatine kinase. Among them, four proteins exhibited phosphorylation changes physiological stimuli: (1) BCKDH-E1alpha subunit increased phosphorylation Ser337 DCA de-energization; (2) apoptosis-inducing factor phosphorylation elevated Ser345 calcium; (3) ATP synthase F1 complex alpha subunit (4) mitofilin dephosphorylated Ser65 Ser264 upon de-energization. screening validated iTRAQ/HCD technology method functional quantitation mitochondrial protein phosphorylation well providing insight regulation mitochondria via phosphorylation.
