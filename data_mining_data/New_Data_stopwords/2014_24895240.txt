 1927 Otto Warburg established tumours derive energy primarily conversion glucose lactic acid partially cellular respiration involving oxygen. 1950s proposed causes cancer reflected different mechanisms disabling cellular respiration favour fermentation (now termed aerobic glycolysis). role aberrant glucose metabolism cancer firmly established. shift away oxidative phosphorylation towards metabolically expensive aerobic glycolysis somewhat counter-intuitive given wasteful nature. Multiple control processes place maintain cellular efficiency likely mechanisms disrupted facilitate shift reliance aerobic glycolysis. One process cell control mediated nuclear receptor superfamily. large family transcription factors plays significant role sensing environmental cues controlling decisions proliferation, differentiation cell death example, regulate glucose uptake metabolism modulate actions oncogenes tumour suppressors. review highlight mechanisms nuclear receptors actions altered tumorigenic transformation serve enhance shift aerobic glycolysis. simplest level, basic alteration NR behaviour serve enhance glycolytic flux thus providing basis enhanced survival within tumour micro-environment. Ameliorating enhanced NR activity context may help sensitize cancer cells Warburg targeted therapies may provide future drug targets.
