 AIM: Leiomyomas, monoclonal tumors developed transformation myometrium somatic stem cells, major health concern severely impair quality life. Pathological alterations signaling pathways recognized key feature variety human diseases. objective analyze treatment all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) suppression phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway growth, signaling pattern interactions among PI3K/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)/retinol leiomyoma proteins. METHODS: Cultures paired myometrium leiomyoma cells premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy collected. Western blot analysis variance used analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences detected treatment ATRA alone LY294002 (a PI3K growth suppressor) response treatment among cell samples cell numbers. Leiomyoma cells less affected. Immunochemical analysis signaling patterns demonstrated treatments affected examined protein levels differently. Significant differences cell type responses treatment pyruvate phosphate dikinase 1 (pPDK1), Bad pbeta-catenin levels identified. pbeta-catenin level showed highly significant interaction response treatment cell type. CONCLUSIONS: ATRA treatment PI3K pathway suppression significantly affected growth, signaling pattern interactions among PI3K/Bcl2/retinol proteins involved growth, survival apoptosis leiomyomas. Interpretation results suggests increasing knowledge role signaling interplay pathogenesis leiomyomas may present opportunity use specific signal transduction inhibitors treating preventing disorder.
