 Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump responsible controlling intracellular extracellular pH cells. structure V-ATPase highly conserved among eukaryotic cells involved diverse functions across species. V-ATPase best known acidification endosomes lysosomes also important luminal acidification specialized cells. Several reports suggested involvement V-ATPase maintaining alkaline intracellular acidic extracellular pH thereby aiding proliferation metastasis cancer cells respectively. Increased expression V-ATPase relocation plasma membrane aids cancer modulates key tumorigenic cell processes like autophagy, Warburg effect, immunomoduation, drug resistance importantly cancer cell signaling. review, discuss direct role V-ATPase acidification indirect regulation signaling pathways, particularly Notch Signaling.
