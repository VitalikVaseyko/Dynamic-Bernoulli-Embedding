 Group N streptococci formed acetaldehyde ethanol glucose. enzymes aldehyde dehydrogenase, phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase present would enable organisms reduce acetyl-CoA acetaldehyde convert acetyl-CoA acetyl phosphate acetate. pentose phosphate pathway converted ribose-5-phosphate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate also present. Acetaldehyde could formed via hexose monophosphate shunt direct decarboxylation pyruvate, enzymes phosphoketolase alpha-carboxylase absent. Phosphoketolase activity induced Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis growth D-xylose. Group N streptococci also contained NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase reduced acetaldehyde ethanol NAD- NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase activities found Leuconostoc cremoris.
