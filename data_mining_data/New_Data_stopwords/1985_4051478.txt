 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase immobilized covalent attachment polyacrylamide support (Akrilex C) containing carboxylic functional groups. result immobilization, pH optimum catalytic activity shifted alkaline direction. apparent Km value phosphoenolpyruvate increased, ADP slightly decreased. respect stability urea thermal inactivation, immobilized pyruvate kinase seemed stable lower urea concentrations 45 55 degrees C. 1.5 2.5M urea higher temperature, marked differences soluble immobilized enzyme.
