 Alzheimer's disease (AD) common cause dementia. Mice transgenic AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mouse line express chimeric mouse/human amyloid-beta protein precursor (Mo/HuAbetaPP695swe) mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) associated early-onset AD. Knowing protein expression mice may offer better understanding pathological changes AD. study, used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined mass spectrometry techniques compare protein expression AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice age-matched wild-type mice throughout disease progression. identified 15 proteins significantly different AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice age-matched controls also changed disease development. Among those, expression levels following proteins AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice least 1.5 times higher normal mice: DCC-interacting protein 13-beta, serum albumin, creatine kinase B-type, heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A, T-complex protein 1 subunit beta, adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta mitochondrial, V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A. Levels following proteins AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice least 1.5 times lower normal mice: dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2, actin cytoplasmic 2, isoform 1 V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit, tubulin alpha-1C chain, F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha-2, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1, actin cytoplasmic 1. proteins involved regulating various cellular functions, including cytoskeletal structure, energy metabolism, synaptic components, protein degradation. findings indicate altered protein expression pathogenesis AD illuminate novel therapeutic avenues treatment AD.
