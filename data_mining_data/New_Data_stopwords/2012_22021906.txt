 objective research study potential function protein kinase C (PKC)-iota cell cycle progression proliferation glioblastoma. PKC-iota highly overexpressed human glioma benign malignant meningioma; however, little understood role regulating cell proliferation glioblastoma. Several upstream molecular aberrations and/or loss PTEN implicated constitutively activate phosphatidylinositol (PI) (3)-kinase pathway. PKC-iota targeted mediator PI (3)-kinase signal transduction repertoire. Results showed PKC-iota highly activated overexpressed glioma cells. PKC-iota directly associated phosphorylated Cdk7 T170 cell cycle-dependent manner, phosphorylating downstream target, cdk2 T160. Cdk2 major role inducing G(1)-S phase progression cells. Purified PKC-iota phosphorylated endogenous exogenous Cdk7. PKC-iota downregulation reduced Cdk7 cdk2 phosphorylation following PI (3)-kinase inhibition, phosphotidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 knockdown well PKC-iota silencing (by siRNA treatment). also diminished cdk2 activity. PKC-iota knockdown inhibited overall proliferation rates induced apoptosis glioma cells. findings suggest glioma cells may proliferating novel PI (3)-kinase-/PKC-iota/Cdk7/cdk2-mediated pathway.
