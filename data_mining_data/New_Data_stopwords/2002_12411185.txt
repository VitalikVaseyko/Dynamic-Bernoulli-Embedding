 OBJECTIVE: assess Microcystin LR (MCLR)-induced acute toxic effects male Sprague-Dawley rats. METHODS: rats injected MCLR intraperitoneally different doses different days. organs serum rats collected 1 7 days injection, 7 days final injection (total 14 days). Pathological enzymatic changes observed. RESULTS: rats injected 122 microg/kg MCLR showed myocardial cells damage including pyknosis, plasma dissolve myofibrilla (pls check dictionary) necrosis heart muscles 24 hours. time, activities serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) creatine phosphonase (CPK) higher groups (P < 0.01). kidney also damaged, kidney cell degeneration, increase blood creatine (BCr) blood urea nitrogen (BUN) also seen. liver pathological study, liver cell hemorrhage, degeneration and/or necrosis observed. serum activities glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (LDH) GOT higher groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: results suggested MCLR injure heart, kidney liver SD rats, dose-response relationship MCLR toxic effect.
