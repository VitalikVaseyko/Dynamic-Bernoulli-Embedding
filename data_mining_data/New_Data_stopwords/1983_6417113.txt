 Azospirillum brasilense Sp7 two mutants examined 19 carbon metabolism enzymes. results indicate nitrogen fixer uses Entner-Doudoroff pathway gluconate dissimilation, lacks catabolic anabolic Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas hexosephosphate pathway, amphibolic triosephosphate enzymes, lacks hexose monophosphate shunt, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, glycerokinase. mutants severely deficient phosphoglycerate pyruvate kinase also somewhat reduced levels carbon enzymes.
