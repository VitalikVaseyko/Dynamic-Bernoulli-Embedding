 Systematic error present high-throughput screens, lowering measurement accuracy. screening occurs early stages research projects, measurement inaccuracy leads following inactive features failing follow active features. Current normalization methods take advantage fact primary-screen features (e.g., compounds) within plate inactive, permits robust estimates row column systematic-error effects. Screens contain majority potentially active features pose difficult challenge even robust normalization methods remove least biological signal. Control plates contain feature wells provide solution problem providing well-by-well estimates systematic error, removed treatment plates. introduce robust control-plate regression (CPR) method, uses approach. CPR's performance compared high-performing primary-screen normalization method four experiments. data also perturbed simulate screens large numbers active features assess CPR's performance. CPR performs almost well best performing normalization methods primary screens outperforms Z-score equivalent methods screens containing large proportion active features.
