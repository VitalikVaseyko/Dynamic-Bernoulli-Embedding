 role glycolytically generated ATP Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated regulation intracellular Ca(2+) signaling examined cultured calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells. Exposure cells (extracellular Ca(2+) concentration = 2 mM) glycolytic inhibitors 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), pyruvate (pyr) + beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), iodoacetic acid (IAA) caused increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). CaMKII inhibitors (KN-93, W-7) triggered similar increase [Ca(2+)](i). rise [Ca(2+)](i) characterized transient spike followed small sustained plateau elevated [Ca(2+)](i). absence extracellular Ca(2+) 2-DG caused increase [Ca(2+)](i), suggesting inhibition glycolysis directly triggered release Ca(2+) intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores. inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate abolished KN-93- 2-DG-induced Ca(2+) response. Ca(2+) release initiated peripheral cytoplasmic processes activation propagated [Ca(2+)](i) wave toward central region cell. Focal application 2-DG resulted spatially confined elevations [Ca(2+)](i). Propagating [Ca(2+)](i) waves preceded [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations small, highly localized elevations [Ca(2+)](i) (Ca(2+) puffs). Inhibition glycolysis 2-DG reduced KN-93-induced Ca(2+) response, vice versa inhibition CaMKII 2-DG-induced Ca(2+) release attenuated. Similar results obtained pyr + beta-HB W-7. Furthermore, 2-DG IAA caused rapid increase intracellular Mg(2+) concentration, indicating concomitant drop cellular ATP levels. conclusion, CaMKII exerts profound inhibition ER Ca(2+) release CPAE cells, mediated glycolytically generated ATP, possibly ATP-dependent phosphorylation IP(3)R.
