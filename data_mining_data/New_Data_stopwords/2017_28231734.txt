 Abnormal expression long non-coding RNA often contributes unrestricted growth cancer cells. Long non-coding RNA XIST expression upregulated several cancers; however, modulatory mechanisms reported hepatocellular carcinoma. study, found XIST expression significantly increased hepatocellular carcinoma tissues cell lines. XIST promoted cell cycle progression G1 phase phase protected cells apoptosis, contributed hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth. addition, revealed reciprocal repression XIST miR-139-5p. PDK1 identified direct target miR-139-5p. proposed XIST responsible hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation, XIST exerted function miR-139-5p/PDK1 axis.
