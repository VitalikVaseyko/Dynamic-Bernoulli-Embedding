 maintain optimal fitness, cell must balance risk inadequate energy reserve response potentially fatal perturbation long-term cost maintaining high concentrations ATP meet occasional spikes demand. apply game theoretic approach address dynamics energy production expenditure eukaryotic cells. Conventionally, glucose metabolism viewed function oxygen concentrations efficient oxidation glucose CO2 H2O produces nearly ATP except hypoxic conditions less efficient (2 ATP/ glucose vs. 36ATP/glucose) anaerobic metabolism glucose lactic acid provides emergency backup. propose alternative energy production governed complex temporal spatial dynamics intracellular ATP demand. short term, cell must provide energy constant baseline needs also maintain capacity rapidly respond fluxes demand particularly due external perturbations cell membrane. Similarly, longer-term dynamics require trade-off cost maintaining high metabolic capacity meet uncommon spikes demand versus risk unsuccessfully responding threats opportunities. develop model computationally explore cell's optimal mix glycolytic oxidative capacity. find Warburg effect, high glycolytic metabolism even normoxic conditions, represents metabolic strategy allow cancer cells optimally meet energy demands posed stochastic fluctuating tumor environments.
