 effect pH (between 5.0 6.3) butyric acid fermentation xylose Clostridium tyrobutyricum studied. pH 6.3, fermentation gave high butyrate production 57.9 g l(-1) yield 0.38-0.59 g g(-1) xylose reactor productivity 3.19 g l(-1)h(-1). However, low pHs (<5.7), fermentation produced acetate lactate main products, small amount butyric acid. metabolic shift butyrate formation lactate acetate formation fermentation found associated changes activities several key enzymes. activities phosphotransbutyrylase (PTB), key enzyme controlling butyrate formation, NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenase (iLDH), catalyzes conversion lactate pyruvate, higher cells producing mainly butyrate pH 6.3. contrast, cells pH 5.0 higher activities phosphotransacetylase (PTA), key enzyme controlling acetate formation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), catalyzes conversion pyruvate lactate. Also, PTA sensitive inhibition butyric acid. Difference specific metabolic rate xylose different pHs suggests balance NADH key controlling metabolic pathway used cells fermentation.
