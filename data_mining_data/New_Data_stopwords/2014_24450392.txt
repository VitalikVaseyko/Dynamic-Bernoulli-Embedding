 Mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) one important events taking place early stage 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. investigate mechanism underlying process, carried temporal proteomic analysis profile dynamic changes MCE. Using 8-plex-iTRAQ-2DLC-MS/MS analysis, 3152 proteins quantified initial 28 h 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. Functional analysis performed 595 proteins maximum minimum quantities 20 h adipogenic induction potentially involved MCE, identified PI3K/AKT/mTOR relevant pathway. Among 595 proteins, PKM2 (Pyruvate kinase M2), patterned protein identified potential target gene C/EBPbeta previous work, selected investigation. Network analysis suggested positive correlations among C/EBPbeta, PIN1, PKM2, may related PI3K-AKT pathway. Knockdown PKM2 siRNA inhibited MCE adipocyte differentiation 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, PKM2 down-regulated mRNA level protein level upon knockdown C/EBPbeta. overexpressed PKM2 partially restore MCE, although restore terminal adipocyte differentiation, inhibited siC/EBPbeta. Thus, PKM2, potentially regulated C/EBPbeta, involved MCE adipocyte differentiation. dynamic proteome changes quantified provide promising basis revealing molecular mechanism regulating adipogenesis.
