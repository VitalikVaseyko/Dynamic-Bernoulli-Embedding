 Hexachlobenzene (HCB), one persistent environmental pollutants, induces porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). aim work analyze effect HCB aspects glucose metabolism, particularly related neosynthesis vivo. purpose, time-course study gluconeogenic enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase (PC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) pyruvate kinase (PK), glycolytic enzyme, carried out. Plasma glucose insulin levels, hepatic glycogen, tryptophan contents, pancreatic insulin secretion pattern stimulated glucose investigated. Oxidative stress heme pathway parameters also evaluated. HCB treatment decreased PC, PEPCK, G-6-Pase activities. effect observed early time point grew treatment progressed. Loss 60, 56, 37%, respectively, noted end treatment considerable amount porphyrins accumulated liver result drastic blockage uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) (95% inhibition). plasma glucose level reduced (one-third loss), storage hepatic glucose stimulated time-dependent way HCB treatment. decay normal plasma insulin level observed fungicide intoxication progressed (twice four times lower). However, normal insulin secretion perifused pancreatic Langerhans islets stimulated glucose 3rd 6th weeks treatment prove significantly affected. HCB promoted time-dependent increase urinary chemiluminiscence (fourfold) hepatic malondialdehide (MDA) content (fivefold), liver tryptophan level raised longest intoxication times. results would suggest HCB treatment cause primary alteration mechanism pancreatic insulin secretion changes induced fungicide insulin levels would adaptative response organism stimulate gluconeogenesis. showed first time HCB causes impairment gluconeogenic pathway. Therefore, reduced levels glucose would thus consequence decreased gluconeogenesis, enhanced glucose storage, unaffected glycolysis. impairment gluconeogenesis (especially PEPCK) related variation glucose levels caused HCB treatment could consequence oxidative stress produced fungicide. Tryptophan adds effect decrease higher phases HCB intoxication, levels overcome control values possibly owing drastic decline URO-D. derangement carbohydrates leads porphyric hepatocytes lower levels free glucose. results contribute understanding protective modulatory effect diets rich carbohydrates hepatic porphyria disease.
