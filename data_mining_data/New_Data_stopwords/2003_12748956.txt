 comparative expression proteome analysis carried analyzing differential expression patterns pulse-labelled proteins two-dimensional gels standard conditions purine nucleotide starvation, followed mass spectrometric identification regulated proteins. Based upon expression patterns, three stimulons could identified Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. Psu proteins (purine starvation up-regulated) increased synthesis purine depletion purine auxotroph. Among proteins enzymes purine biosynthesis pathways (PurE, PurS, PurM, PurL), enzymes involved generation C1 units (GlyA, Fhs). C1 units primarily required purine biosynthesis. Upon analysis nucleotide sequence preceding structural genes proteins L. lactis IL1403 genome sequence showed contained PurBox-Pribnov box structures resembling PurR activated promoters purDEK purCSQLF operons. Most, possibly members Psu stimulon thus members PurR regulon. Five Psu proteins could identified. second stimulon, Psd stimulon (purine starvation decreased), whose members down-regulated purine depletion, contained proteins related protein synthesis (PpsB, EF-TS, trigger factor), GTPases (FtsZ, EF-TS); involved energy metabolism (GapB, CcpA). common regulatory elements could found members stimulon. Two Psd proteins escaped identification. last, Dcu (decoynine up-regulated), stimulon contained proteins whose synthesis escaped severe general depression inhibition GMP synthetase decoynine. regulon comprised mostly glycolytic enzymes (fructose bisphosphate aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase) translation elongation factors (GTPases: EF-TU, EF-G). Two Dcu proteins could identified. 28 proteins subjected mass spectrometry, 19 could readily identified despite fact genome sequence strain L. lactis subsp. lactis available. two subspecies share 85% sequence identity, comparable genetic distance Escherichia coli Salmonella typhimurium. success rate 68% indicates may feasible perform proteomics based upon genomic sequences relatives outside genus.
