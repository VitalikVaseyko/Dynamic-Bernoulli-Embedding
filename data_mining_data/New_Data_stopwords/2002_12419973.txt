 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA identified transcript rapidly generally induced fibrates various tissues mouse. time course induction much faster typical peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha)-regulated peroxisomal mRNAs. Rapid efficient induction PDK4 mRNA various tissues would inactivate pyruvate dehydrogenase stimulate fatty acid oxidation whole body level, leading enhanced utilization serum fatty acids triglycerides. metabolic switching mechanism explain early phase fibrate-induced decrease serum levels triglycerides. Furthermore, muscle fibrate-induced early state limited activity pyruvate dehydrogenase low levels fatty acids utilize proteins energy source extensive degradation proteins may lead myopathy rhabdomyolysis.
