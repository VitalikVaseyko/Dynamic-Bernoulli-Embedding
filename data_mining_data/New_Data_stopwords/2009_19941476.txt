 Warburg stated hypothesis tumor cell metabolism 80 years ago, field carbohydrate metabolism cancer cells solid tumors experiencing boom past years. Numerous studies focused characteristics cancer metabolism accessibility novel therapeutic interventions. Malignant transformation associated increase glycolytic flux, mainly caused upregulation numerous glycolysis-related genes majority human cancers. consequence alterations, tumor cells producing lactate higher levels compared non-malignant tissue, even presence oxygen, phenomenon termed "aerobic glycolysis" "Warburg effect". correlation alterations glycolytic pathways therapy resistance tumors partially due radical scavenger properties specific metabolites may decrease therapy-induced radical formation. Glycolytic activity glycolysis-linked metabolic milieu often variable individual tumors resulting variations treatment response aggressiveness. peculiarities tumor cell metabolism utilized cancer diagnostics, metabolic imaging techniques metabolic tumor markers. emerging field research manipulation tumor cell metabolism therapeutic purposes; respective studies include approaches glycolysis inhibition forcing mitochondrial respiration, respectively, based biochemical molecular principles. now, approach could eliminate tumors patients without side effects applied single drug. Nevertheless, several agents manipulate tumor metabolism may become supportive therapy combination established cancer treatments.
