 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) poor prognosis despite novel biological targeted therapies. Tumor aggressiveness poor survival may correlate tumor grade diagnosis complex metabolic alterations, also involving glucose lipid metabolism. However, currently grade-specific metabolic therapy addresses alterations. used primary cell cultures ccRCC low- high-grade investigate effect energy state reduced pyridine nucleotide level, viability proliferation, specific inhibition glycolysis 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), fatty acid oxidation Etomoxir. primary cultures retained tissue grade-dependent modulation lipid glycogen storage aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). 2DG affected lactate production, energy state reduced pyridine nucleotide level high-grade ccRCC cultures, energy state low-grade. Rather, Etomoxir affected energy state high-grade reduced pyridine nucleotide level low-grade cultures. Energy state reduced pyridine nucleotide level evaluated ATP reduced 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) dye quantification, respectively. 2DG treatment impaired cell proliferation viability low-grade ccRCC normal cortex cultures, whereas Etomoxir showed cytostatic cytotoxic effect high-grade ccRCC cultures. data indicate ccRCC Warburg effect grade-dependent feature, fatty acid oxidation activated different grade-dependent metabolic needs. possible grade-dependent metabolic therapeutic approach ccRCC also highlighted.
