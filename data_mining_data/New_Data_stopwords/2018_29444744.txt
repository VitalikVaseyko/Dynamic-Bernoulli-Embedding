 cancers rely disproportionately glycolysis energy even presence adequate oxygen supply, condition known "aerobic glycolysis", "Warburg effect". Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1a subunit (PDHA1) one main factors metabolic switch oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) aerobic glycolysis suggested closely associated tumorigenesis. observed PDHA1 protein reduced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens immunohistochemistry western blot, significantly associated poor overall survival. analyze function PDHA1 cancer cells, up-regulated HCC cell line SMMC-7721 HepG2. results demonstrated overexpression PDHA1 gene inhibited aerobic glycolysis lower lactate via increased PDH activity, meanwhile mitochondrial OXPHOS enhanced accompanied higher ATP lower glucose consumption. also found apoptosis promoted intrinsic pathway proteins increased PDHA1 overexpressing cells. Collectively, data indicate reduced PDHA1 protein expression associated poor clinical outcome HCC cancers. Up-regulated PDHA1 gene expression inhibit Warburg effect enhanced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway.
