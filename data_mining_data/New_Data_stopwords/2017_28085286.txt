 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 1-4 (PDK1-4) negatively control activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) up-regulated obesity, diabetes, heart failure, cancer. reported earlier two novel pan-PDK inhibitors PS8 [4-((5-hydroxyisoindolin-2-yl)sulfonyl)benzene-1,3-diol] (1) PS10 [2-((2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)sulfonyl)isoindoline-4,6-diol] (2) targeted ATP-binding pocket PDKs. Here, developed new generation PDK inhibitors extending dihydroxyphenyl sulfonylisoindoline scaffold 1 2 entrance region ATP-binding pocket PDK2. lead inhibitor (S)-3-amino-4-(4-((2-((2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)sulfonyl)isoindolin-5-yl)amino)piperid in-1-yl)-4-oxobutanamide (17) shows approximately 8-fold lower IC50 (58 nM) 2 (456 nM). crystal structure, asparagine moiety 17 provides additional interactions Glu-262 PDK2. Treatment diet-induced obese mice 17 resulted significant liver-specific augmentation PDC activity, accompanied improved glucose tolerance drastically reduced hepatic steatosis. findings support 17 potential glucose-lowering therapeutic targeting liver obesity type 2 diabetes.
