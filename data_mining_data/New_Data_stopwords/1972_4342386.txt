 1. study made ability rat liver vivo maintain equilibrium combined glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase lactate dehydrogenase reactions, i.e. system: [Formula: see text] Attempts made upset equilibrium. [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio rapidly changed injection ethanol crotyl alcohol, value [ATP]/[ADP][HPO(4) (2-)] rapidly changed injection ethionine carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone. 2. concentrations metabolites occurring equation measured freeze-clamped liver. 3. Although injected agents caused large changes concentrations individual components, near-equilibrium system maintained, indicated fact value [ATP]/[ADP][HPO(4) (2-)], referred phosphorylation state adenine nucleotides, measured directly agreed value calculated equilibrium conditions equation. 4. results discussed taken confirm order magnitude value redox state cytoplasmic NAD couple rat liver controlled phosphorylation state adenine nucleotide system.
