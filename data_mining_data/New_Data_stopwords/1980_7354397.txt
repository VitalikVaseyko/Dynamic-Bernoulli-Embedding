 Male weanling rats meal-fed (2 hours daily) vitamin B-6-deficient diet 8 weeks; controls pair-fed. Vitamin B-6 deficiency led expected decreases activities hepatic alanine aspartate aminotransferases influence glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.2), pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.6.1.1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). ability deficient rats incorporate 14C labeled alanine blood glucose expired CO2 diminished, pyruvate-U-14C utilized normally. deficiency influence gluconeogenesis glutamate 2-oxoglutarate. Furthermore, gluconeogenic potential renal cortex slices incubated pyruvate 2-oxoglutarate unaltered deficiency. data suggest impairment gluconeogenesis amino acids vitamin B-6 deficiency may consequence diminished transamination prior oxidative deamination.
