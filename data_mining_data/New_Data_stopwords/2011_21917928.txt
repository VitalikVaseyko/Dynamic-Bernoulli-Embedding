 Overexpression Ski oncogene induces oncogenic transformation chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). However, unlike oncogene-transformed cells, Ski-transformed CEFs (Ski-CEFs) display classical Warburg effect. contrary, Ski transformation reduced lactate production glucose utilization CEFs. Compared CEFs, Ski-CEFs exhibited enhanced TCA cycle activity, fatty acid catabolism beta-oxidation, glutamate oxidation, oxygen consumption, well increased numbers mass mitochondria. Interestingly, expression PPARgamma, key transcription factor regulates adipogenesis lipid metabolism, dramatically elevated mRNA protein levels Ski-CEFs. Accordingly, PPARgamma target genes involved lipid uptake, transport, oxidation also markedly up-regulated Ski. Knocking PPARgamma Ski-CEFs RNA interference reversed elevated expression PPARgamma target genes, well shift oxidative metabolism increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, found Ski co-immunoprecipitates PPARgamma co-activates PPARgamma-driven transcription.
