 peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) plays key role regulating fatty acid metabolism regulating expression genes involved fatty acid oxidation. identify endogenous transcripts could used surrogate markers on-target activity PPARalpha agonists, employed global profiling approach using DNA microarrays. HK-2 cell line derived proximal tubules human kidney, showed induction several genes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK-4) adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP) PPARalpha ligands. HK-2 cells express detectable levels PPARalpha dimerization partner retinoid X receptor (RXRalpha) proteins. Induction PDK-4 cells correlates induction PDK-4 liver fat-fed hamsters. magnitude fibrate induction PDK-4 liver also mirrors decrease serum triglyceride levels. Thus, induction PDK-4 PPARalpha agonists HK-2 cell model closely correlates induction vivo may represent early marker PPARalpha agonist action.
