 tumors undergo metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis, so-called Warburg effect, support growth survival. Overexpression IF1, physiological inhibitor F0F1ATPase, related phenomenon appears relevant marker cancer. Environmental contributions cancer development widely accepted little known underlying intracellular mechanisms. Among environmental pollutants humans commonly exposed to, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), prototype molecule polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), well-known human carcinogen. Besides apoptotic signals, B[a]P also induce survival signals liver cells, likely involved cancer promotion. previous works showed B[a]P elicited Warburg-like effect, thus favoring cell survival. present study aimed elucidating molecular mechanisms involved B[a]P-induced metabolic reprogramming, testing possible involvement IF1. presently demonstrate, vitro vivo, PAHs, especially B[a]P, strongly increase IF1 expression. increase, might rely beta2-adrenergic receptor activation, notably participates B[a]P-induced glycolytic shift cell survival liver cells. identifying IF1 target PAHs, study provides new insights environmental factors may contribute related carcinogenesis.
