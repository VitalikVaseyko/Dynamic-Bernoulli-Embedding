 R3230AC mammary adenocarcinoma dependent insulin; tumor growth equal greater diabetic rats intact animals. However, tumor growth reduced daily doses insulin administered. Treatment estrogen inhibited growth R3230AC carcinoma, either diabetic rats intact animals simultaneously treated insulin. effects insulin plus estrogen treatment appeared additive causing inhibition tumor growth. Tumors diabetic rats showed metabolic alterations reflected little changes activities selected glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, hexokinase, striking changes activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, representing pentose phosphate pathway. modest reduction ratio utilization (1-14C)glucose: (6-14C)glucose seen vitro tumors diabetic rats. concluded insulin, along estrogen prolactin, considered hormonal factor influences growth automonous, hormone-responsive adenocarcinoma.
