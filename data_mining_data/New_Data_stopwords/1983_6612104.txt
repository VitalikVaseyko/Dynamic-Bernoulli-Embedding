 commonly observed acclimatization altitude oxidative enzyme activities increase per g wet weight tissue. examine problem long-term adapted animals measured citrate synthase (CS), hydroxyacylCoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities/g myocardium two domestic species (llama alpaca) high altitude deer, taruca. species, found upward scaling oxidative capacity (indicated absolute activities CS HOAD) downward scaling anaerobic/aerobic metabolic potentials heart (indicated low ratios LDH/CS, LDH/HOAD, high ratios PK/LDH). direction magnitude long-term adaptations shorter-term acclimatizations, wondered similar pattern enzyme level correlates right shift O2 dissociation curve (ODC) latter case, left shifted ODC former. hypothesize long term, increased oxidative enzyme activities allow increased maximum flux capacity aerobic metabolism. turn calls physiological adjustments O2 transfer systems; flux limits former must matched flux limits latter. acceptably high scope aerobic activity achieved despite reduced O2 availability inspired air. long-term match-up invariably calls left-shifted ODC plus well known adjustments O2 transport. short term, right shifting ODC may increase total amount aerobic work possible (by favoring O2 unloading thus raising tissue O2 concentration), yet maximum flux capacity cannot changed much mitochondrial metabolism designed maintaining stable rates ATP synthesis even widely varying O2 tensions. even short-term acclimatization, order increase flux capacity, activities oxidative enzymes also must increased.
