 E. coli strain PPA305, wild-type PTS system, PPA316, utilizes proton-galactose symport system glucose uptake, used host strains harbor phenylalanine overproduction plasmid pSY130-14 study effects using different glucose uptake systems phenylalanine production. non-PTS strain (PPA316/pSY130-14) produced much less phenylalanine, ranging 0 67% produced PTS strain (PPA305/pSY130-14) depending cultivation conditions used. non-PTS strain PPA316/pSY130-14 intracellular PEP concentration one-sixth PTS strain, PPA305/pSY130-14. Additionally, PPA316/pSY130-14 substantially lower energy state terms size pool high-energy phosphate compounds magnitude pH difference across cytoplasmic membrane. non-PTS strain consumed oxygen higher rate, attained lower biomass concentration, produced acetate phenylalanine fermentation, suggesting carbon oxidized CO2, likely TCA cycle. Analysis intracellular fluxes central carbon pathways performed strain utilizing exponential phase data extracellular components assuming quasi-steady state intermediate metabolites. non-PTS strain higher flux pyruvate kinase (PYK) TCA cycle which, agreement observed higher oxygen uptake rate, suggests carbon oxidized CO2 TCA cycle. analysis using rate expression data PYK NMR data intracellular metabolites identified regulatory properties PYK probable cause lower intracellular PEP levels PPA316/pSY130-14.
