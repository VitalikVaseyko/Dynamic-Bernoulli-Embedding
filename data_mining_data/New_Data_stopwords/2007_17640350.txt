 BACKGROUND: systems biology, network-based pathway analysis facilitates understanding designing metabolic systems enables prediction metabolic flux distributions. Network-based flux analysis requires considering pathway architectures also proteome transcriptome predict flux distributions, recombinant microbes significantly change distribution gene expressions. current problem integrate heterogeneous data build network-based model. RESULTS: link enzyme activity data flux distributions metabolic networks, proposed Enzyme Control Flux (ECF), novel model integrates enzyme activity elementary mode analysis (EMA). ECF presents power-law formula describing changes enzyme activities wild-type mutant related changes elementary mode coefficients (EMCs). validate feasibility ECF, integrated enzyme activity data EMCs Escherichia coli Bacillus subtilis wild-type. ECF model effectively uses enzyme activity profile estimate flux distribution mutants increase number incorporated enzyme activities decreases model error ECF. CONCLUSION: ECF model non-mechanistic static model link enzyme activity profile metabolic flux distribution introducing power-law formula EMA, suggesting change enzyme profile rather reflects change flux distribution. ECF model highly applicable central metabolism knockout mutants E. coli B. subtilis.
