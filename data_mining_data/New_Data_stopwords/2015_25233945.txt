 study examines age-dependent metabolic-inflammatory axis primary astrocytes isolated brain cortices 7-, 13-, 18-month-old Sprague-Dawley male rats. Astrocytes showed age-dependent increase mitochondrial oxidative metabolism respiring glucose and/or pyruvate substrates; increase mitochondrial oxidative metabolism accompanied increases COX3/18SrDNA values, thus suggesting enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. Enhanced mitochondrial respiration astrocytes limits substrate supply astrocytes neurons; may viewed adaptive mechanism altered cellular inflammatory-redox environment age. metabolic changes associated age-dependent increase hydrogen peroxide generation (largely ascribed enhanced expression NOX2) NFkappaB signaling cytosol well translocation nucleus. Astrocytes also displayed augmented responses age inflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta, TNFalpha. Activation NFkappaB signaling resulted increased expression nitric oxide synthase 2 (inducible nitric oxide synthase), leading elevated nitric oxide production. IL-1beta TNFalpha treatment stimulated mitochondrial oxidative metabolism mitochondrial biogenesis astrocytes. may surmised increased mitochondrial aerobic metabolism inflammatory responses interconnected support functionality switch astrocytes, neurotrophic neurotoxic age.
