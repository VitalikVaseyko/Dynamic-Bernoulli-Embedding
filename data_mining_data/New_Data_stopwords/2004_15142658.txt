 Acanthocytosis refers transformation normal biconcave disc erythrocyte one irregularly shaped external projections distributed unevenly membrane surface. associated variety inherited acquired disorders. relationship acanthocytosis chorea-acanthocytosis alteration Band 3, anion exchange protein, previously suggested. previously proposed mechanism erythrocyte shape control decrease increase ratio outward-facing (Band 3(o)) inward-facing (Band 3(i)) conformations Band 3 contracts relaxes membrane skeleton, thus promoting echinocytosis stomatocytosis, respectively. equilibrium Band 3(o)/Band 3(i) ratio determined Donnan equilibrium ratio anions protons, increasing increase Donnan ratio. Based evidence suggesting acanthocyte echinocyte interrelated, mechanism could explain decrease Donnan ratio occurrence acanthocytes pyruvate kinase pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiencies, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytocytosis, In(Lu) phenotype, chorea-acanthocytosis, McLeod phenotype. Consistent proposed mechanism indicating membrane skeleton important determinant erythrocyte shape, alteration conformation chorea-acanthocytosis, McLeod phenotype Fanconi's anemia. agreement proposed mechanism indicating Band 3 conformation controls erythrocyte shape occurrence acanthocytosis individuals expressing rare Band 3 HT variant alterations Band 3 properties chorea-acanthocytosis In(Lu) phenotype. observations lipid composition organization normal chorea-acanthocytosis McLeod phenotype supportive proposed mechanism since postulates lipid bilayer secondary role determining erythrocyte shape. acanthocytoses alcoholic cirrhosis abetalipoproteinemia accompanied significant increases cholesterol level ratio sphingomyelin glycerophospholipids, respectively. However, could occur change Band 3 conformation since cholesterol binds specifically Band 3 inhibits anion transport activity, sphingomyelin potentiates inhibition. Thus, acanthocytosis could involve alteration Band 3 conformation.
