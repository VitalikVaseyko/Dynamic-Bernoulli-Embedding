 Intravenous administration single dose (100 micrograms/kg bw) recombinant tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF, cachectin) rats increased rate vitro fatty acid synthesis interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) glucose alanine, without changes oxidation substrates 14CO2. Lactate production glycerol release also unaffected treatment cytokine. Additionally, presence TNF incubation media affect fatty acid synthesis, suggesting indirect effect cytokine. activities different enzymes glucose alanine metabolism hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase alanine transaminase, suffer changes consequence TNF administration. applied enzymatic activities involved fatty acid synthesis fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase ATP-citrate lyase. Conversely, citrate levels IBAT increased animals treated TNF, suggesting could cause increased fatty acid synthesis tissue.
