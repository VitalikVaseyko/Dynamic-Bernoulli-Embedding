 Theileria parva schizonts propagated vitro peripheral blood lymphocytes purified assayed key enzymes glucose glycerol catabolism citric acid cycle. activities glycolytic enzymes range 21-100 nmol/min/mg protein. Glycerol kinase alpha -glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities 16 times lower activities enzymes catalysing oxidation triose phosphates lactate. suggested catabolism glycerol negligible glucose catabolized lactate via Embden-Meyerhof pathway. activities enzymes catalysing section citric acid cycle involves formation citrate succinyl-CoA consistently low (less 2.0 nmol/min/mg protein), indicating part cycle plays minor role parasite. Enzyme activities cycle catalysing formation succinate oxaloacetate relatively higher catalysing sections citric acid cycle, suggesting section cycle could important parasite. Pyruvate carboxylase activity 10 times phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. suggested pyruvate could carboxylated oxaloacetate. Taken together, results suggest catabolism glucose Theileria parva schizonts mainly via Embden-Meyerhof pathway citric acid cycle plays minor role energy production.
