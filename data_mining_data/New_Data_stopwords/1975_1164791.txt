 describe enzymatic method determing serum triglycerides (triacylglycerols). triglycerides hydrolyzed mixture lipase esterase. glycerol released determined kinetic fixed-time analysis, use glycerol kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase. addition competitive inhibitor ATP Michaelis constant pyruvate kinase apparently increased, considerably extending linearity assay. need serum blanks reagent blanks. method adapted centrifugal analyzer (the ENI GEMSAEC). yields satisfactory results regard precision, accuracy, insensitivity interferences.
