 studied systemic brain glucose lactate metabolism Huntington's disease (HD) patients response ergometer cycling. Following termination exercise, blood glucose increased abruptly control subjects, peak seen HD patients (2.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.0 +/- 0.2mM, P < 2 x 10(-6)). difference seen brain metabolism parameters. Reduced hepatic glucose output HD mouse model R6/2 following lactate challenge, combined reduced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase increased pyruvate kinase activity mouse liver suggest reduced capacity gluconeogenesis HD, possibly contributing clinical symptoms HD. propose blood glucose concentration recovery exercise applied liver function test HD patients.
