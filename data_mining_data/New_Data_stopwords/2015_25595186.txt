 WWOX gene spans common chromosomal fragile site FRA16D located within massive (780 kb) intron. WWOX gene long, 1.1 Mb, may contribute low abundance full-length 1.4 kb mRNA. Alternative splicing also accounts variety aberrant transcripts, devoid C-terminal sequences required WWOX act oxidoreductase. mouse WWOX gene also spans chromosomal fragile site implying sort functional relationship confers selective advantage. encoded protein domains WWOX conserved evolution (between humans Drosophila melanogaster) include WW domains, NAD -binding site, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzyme nuclear compartmentalization signals. homology enabled functional analyses D. melanogaster demonstrate roles WWOX reactive oxygen species regulation metabolism. Indeed human WWOX gene also responsive altered metabolism. Cancer cells typically exhibit altered metabolism (Warburg effect). Many cancers exhibit FRA16D DNA instability results aberrant WWOX expression associated poor prognosis cancers. therefore thought aberrant WWOX expression contributes altered metabolism cancer. addition, others found specific (low-expression) allele WWOX genotype contributes cancer predisposition.
