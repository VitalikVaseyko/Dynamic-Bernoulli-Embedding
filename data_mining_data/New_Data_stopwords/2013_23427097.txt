 sporadic forms cancer Alzheimer's disease (AD) age-related metabolic disorders. However, molecular mechanisms underlying two diseases distinct: cancer described essentially limitless replicative potential, whereas neuronal death key feature AD. Studies origin diseases indicate sporadic forms result metabolic dysregulation, compensatory increase energy transduction inversely related. cancer, compensatory metabolic effect upregulation glycolysis-the Warburg effect; AD, bioenergetic model based interaction astrocytes neurons indicates compensatory metabolic alteration upregulation oxidative phosphorylation-an inverse Warburg effect. two modes metabolic alteration could contribute inverse relation incidence two diseases. invoke bioenergetic mechanism furnish molecular basis epidemiological observation, namely incidence sporadic forms cancer AD inversely related. furthermore exploit molecular mechanisms underlying diseases propose common therapeutic strategies cancer AD based metabolic intervention.
