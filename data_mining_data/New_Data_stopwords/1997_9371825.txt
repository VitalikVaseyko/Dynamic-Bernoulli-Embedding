 Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) plays critical role regulating expression many genes essential normal functioning liver, gut, kidney, pancreatic islets. nonsense mutation (Q268X) exon 7 HNF4alpha gene responsible autosomal dominant, early-onset form non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (maturity-onset diabetes young; gene named MODY1). Although mutation predicted delete 187 C-terminal amino acids HNF4alpha protein molecular mechanism causes diabetes unknown. address this, first studied functional properties MODY1 mutant protein. show lost transcriptional transactivation activity, fails dimerize bind DNA, implying MODY1 phenotype loss HNF4alpha function. effect loss function HNF4alpha target gene expression investigated embryonic stem cells, amenable genetic manipulation induced form visceral endoderm. visceral endoderm shares many properties liver pancreatic beta-cells, including expression genes glucose transport metabolism, offers ideal system investigate HNF4-dependent gene regulation glucose homeostasis. exploiting system identified several genes encoding components glucose-dependent insulin secretion pathway whose expression dependent upon HNF4alpha. include glucose transporter 2, glycolytic enzymes aldolase B glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, liver pyruvate kinase. addition found expression fatty acid binding proteins cellular retinol binding protein also down-regulated absence HNF4alpha. data provide direct evidence HNF4alpha critical regulating glucose transport glycolysis crucial maintaining glucose homeostasis.
