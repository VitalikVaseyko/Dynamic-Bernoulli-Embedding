 virtually unknown nitrogen oxide, nitroxyl (HNO) emerged potential pharmacological agent. Recent advances understanding chemistry HNO led understanding HNO biochemistry vastly different known chemistry biochemistry nitric oxide (NO), one-electron oxidation product HNO. cardiovascular roles extensively studied, key modulator vascular tone involved number vascular related pathologies. HNO displays unique cardiovascular properties shown positive lusitropic ionotropic effects failing hearts without chronotropic effect. Additionally, HNO causes release CGRP modulates calcium channels ryanodine receptors. HNO shown beneficial effects ischemia reperfusion injury, HNO treatment ischemia-reperfusion reduces infarct size. addition cardiovascular effects observed, HNO shown initial promise realm cancer therapy. HNO demonstrated inhibit GAPDH, key glycolytic enzyme. Due Warburg effect, inhibiting glycolysis attractive target inhibiting tumor proliferation. Indeed, HNO recently shown inhibit tumor proliferation mouse xenografts. Additionally, HNO inhibits tumor angiogenesis induces cancer cell apoptosis. effects seen HNO donors quite different donors cases opposite. chemical nature HNO explains HNO NO, although closely chemically related, act differently biochemical systems. also gives insight potential molecular motifs may reactive towards HNO opens novel field pharmacological development.
