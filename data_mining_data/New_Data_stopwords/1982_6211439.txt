 inhibition light chloroplast coupling factor ATPase due simply competing photophosphorylation. inhibition partially relieved either arsenate-pool trap released phosphate, pyruvate kinase/phosphoenolpyruvate trap ADP. Moreover, amount product return occur absence trapping systems, ascertained incorporation 32Pi [2-3H]ADP back ATP hydrolysis reaction, insufficient account observed activity decrease. intermediate pi:H2O oxygen exchange studies, number water oxygens incorporated molecule Pi produced vary light intensity ATPase assay. indicates light-induced change ATPase activity due alteration rat constants involved forward reverse partitioning E.ADP.Pi complex. contrast, ammonium chloride, uncoupler photophosphorylation stimulates membrane-bound coupling factor ATPase added light activation, causes shift pattern intermediate Pi:H2O oxygen exchange toward lower number water oxygens incorporated per Pi formed. effect NH4+ consistent ATPase activity stimulation caused enhanced partitioning forward E.products complex. observations suggest operation two mechanisms regulation ATP ase activity chloroplast de-energization. However, direct effect NH4+ coupling factor itself, independent membrane energization effect, cannot ruled present studies. Additional oxygen exchange experiments lead conclusion binding ATP site catalyzing extensive ATP:H2O back exchange native chloroplast system ( Wimmer, M. J., Rose, I. A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6769-6775) different binding ATP net hydrolysis system activated ATPase.
