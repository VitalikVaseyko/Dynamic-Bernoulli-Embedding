 relationship free cytosolic [ADP] (and [P(i)]) steady-state aerobic muscle work rat gastrocnemius muscle vivo using (31)P NMR investigated. Anesthetized rats ventilated placed custom-built cradle fitted force transducer could placed 7-tesla NMR magnet. Muscle work induced supramaximal sciatic nerve stimulation activated fibers. Muscles stimulated 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0 Hz twitch force, phosphocreatine, P(i) unchanged two consecutive spectra acquired 4-min blocks (8-12 min). Parallel bench experiments performed measure total tissue glycogen, lactate, total creatine, pyruvate freeze-clamped muscles 10 min stimulation frequency. 0.5 Hz, significant change muscle glycogen, lactate, lactate/pyruvate ratios 8-12 min. 0.8 Hz, 17% fall glycogen 65% rise muscle lactate concomitant fall pH. frequency, glycogen fell rapidly, lactate continued rise, ATP pH declined. basis force metabolic measurements, estimated maximal mitochondrial capacity (V(max)) 0.8 Hz. Free [ADP] calculated submaximal workload measuring reactants creatine kinase equilibrium adjusting K'(CK) muscle temp (30 degrees C), pH, pMg. show ADP (and P(i)) tension-time integral follow Hill relationship least second order function.
