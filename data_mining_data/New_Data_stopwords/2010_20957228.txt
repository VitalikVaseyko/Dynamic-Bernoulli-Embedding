 BACKGROUND: Recently, surge interest developing compounds selectively targeting mitochondria treatment neoplasms. critical role mitochondria cellular metabolism respiration supports therapeutic rationale. Dysfunction processes energy production metabolism contributes attenuation response pro-apoptotic stimuli increased ROS production implicated initiation progression human cancers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: high-throughput MTT-based screen 10,000 drug-like small molecules anti-proliferative activity identified phosphonium salts TP187, 197 421 IC(5)(0) concentrations submicromolar range. TP treatment induced cell cycle arrest independent p53 status, determined analysis DNA content propidium iodide stained cells. mouse model human breast cancer, TP-treated mice showed significantly decreased tumor growth compared vehicle paclitaxel treated mice. toxicities organ damage observed following TP treatment. Immunohistochemical staining tissue sections TP187-treated tumors demonstrated decrease cellular proliferation increased caspase-3 cleavage. fluorescent properties analog TP421 exploited assess subcellular uptake TP compounds, demonstrating mitochondrial localization. Following mitochondrial uptake cells exhibited decreased oxygen consumption concomittant increase mitochondrial superoxide production. Proteomics analysis results 600 target antibody microarray demonstrated TP compounds significantly affected signaling pathways relevant growth proliferation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: continued interest designing compounds targeting cancer-cell metabolism, Warburg effect, mitochondria recently discovered series novel, small-molecule compounds containing triphenylphosphine moiety show remarkable activity panel cancer cell lines well mouse model human breast cancer. mechanism action includes mitochondrial localization causing decreased oxygen consumption, increased superoxide production attenuated growth factor signaling.
