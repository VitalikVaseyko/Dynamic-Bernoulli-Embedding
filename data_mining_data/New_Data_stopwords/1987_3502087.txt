 crystal structure porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA) solved 2.9 resolution X-ray crystallographic methods. enzyme contains three domains. larger, N-terminal part, consists 330 amino acid residues. central domain typical parallel-stranded alpha-beta barrel structure (alpha beta)8, already found number enzymes like triose phosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase. C-terminal domain forms distinct globular unit chain folds eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel. third domain lies beta-strand alpha-helix central domain, position similar found domain B triose phosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase. essentially composed antiparallel beta-sheets. active site located cleft within N-terminal central domain, carboxy-end beta-strands (alpha beta)8 barrel. Binding various substrate analogues enzyme suggests amino acid residues involved catalytic reaction pair aspartic acids. number residues surround substrate seem participate binding via hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions. 'essential' calcium ion located near active site region two domains, providing two calcium ligands. basis sequence comparisons calcium binding site suggested common structural feature alpha-amylases. represents new type calcium-protein interaction pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
