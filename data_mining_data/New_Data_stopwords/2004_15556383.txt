 Painted turtles hibernating winter may endure long-term exposure low temperature anoxia. two conditions may affect aerobic capacity tissue might particular importance cardiac muscle normally highly reliant aerobic energy production. present study addressed hibernation affects respiratory characteristics mitochondria situ metabolic pattern turtle myocardium. Painted turtles acclimated control (25 degrees C), cold (5 degrees C) normoxic cold anoxic conditions. saponin-skinned myocardial fibres, cold acclimation increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity decreased apparent ADP-affinity. Concomitant anoxia affect this. Creatine increased apparent ADP-affinity similar values three acclimation groups, suggesting functional coupling creatine kinase mitochondrial respiration. metabolic pattern, cold acclimation decreased glycolytic capacity terms pyruvate kinase activity increased lactate dehydrogenase (LHD) activity. Concomitant anoxia counteracted cold-induced decrease pyruvate kinase activity increased creatine kinase activity. conclusion, cold acclimation seems increase aerobic decrease anaerobic energy production capacity painted turtle myocardium. Importantly, anoxia affect mitochondrial functional integrity seems increase capacity anaerobic energy production energy buffering.
