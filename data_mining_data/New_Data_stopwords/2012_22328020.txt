 small alkylating molecule, 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), potent specific anticancer agent. 3BP different action currently available chemo-drugs. Thus, 3BP targets cancer cells' energy metabolism, high glycolysis ("Warburg Effect") mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. inhibits/ blocks total energy production leading depletion energy reserves. Moreover, 3BP "Energy Blocker", rapid killing cells. sharp contrast commonly used anticancer agents usually take longer show noticeable effect. addition, 3BP effective concentrations kill cancer cells little effect normal cells. Therefore, 3BP considered member, perhaps one first, new class anticancer agents. Following 3BP's discovery novel anticancer agent vitro Year 2000 (Published Ko et al. Lett 173:83-91, 2001), also highly effective rapid anticancer agent vivo shortly thereafter (Ko et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 324:269-275, 2004), efficacy potent anticancer agent humans demonstrated. Here, based translational research, report results case study young adult cancer patient fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, bench side discovery Department Biological Chemistry Johns Hopkins University, School Medicine taken effectively bedside treatment Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt/Main Hospital, Germany. results obtained hold promise 3BP future cancer therapeutic without apparent cyto-toxicity formulated properly.
