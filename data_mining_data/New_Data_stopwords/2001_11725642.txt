 gene pyruvate kinase, involved glycolysis catalyze biochemical reaction phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, screened, cloned sequenced non-photosynthetic Oomycetes, Achlya bisexualis cDNA library. size gene 1.6 kb. amino acid sequence gene deduced using GCG program. basis analysis on-line PSORT II program deduced amino acid sequence showed pyruvate kinase expressed gene located cytosol. result indicated possible process glycolysis lower form eukaryotic cell Achlya bisexuali may occur cytosol, different Liaud's report.
