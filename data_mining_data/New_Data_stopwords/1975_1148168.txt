 Tissues fetal adult chickens examined pyruvate kinase activity. Two electrophoretically distinguishable noninterconvertible isozymes found. One these, designated type K (for kidney), sole pyruvate kinase early fetus found appreciable quantities adult tissues except striated muscle. second isozyme, type M, appears shortly hatching striated muscle brain. two isozymes correspond developmental pattern, tissue distribution, electrophoretic, immunological, kinetic propertiesto similarly designated mammalian pyruvate kinases. However, kinetic, immunological, electrophoretic evidence could found chicken isozyme corresponding mammalian type L pyruvate kinase. latter isozyme seems limited distribution mostly highly differentiated gluconeogenic tissues (notable liver, kidney, small intestine), results support proposition mammalian type L pyruvate kinase specilized isozyme present mammals birds.
