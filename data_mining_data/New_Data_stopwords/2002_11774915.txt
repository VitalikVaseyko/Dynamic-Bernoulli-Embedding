 trienzyme sensor amperometric determination acetic acid prepared immobilizing acetate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate oxidase (PyOx) poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-coated electrode. AK catalyzes phospho-transferring reaction acetic acid ATP form ADP; PK, phospho-transferring reaction ADP phosphoenolpyruvate form pyruvic acid; PyOx, oxidation pyruvic acid oxygen. oxygen consumption could monitored using PDMS-coated electrode without interference PyOx reaction product, hydrogen peroxide. Thus, concentration acetic acid (5 microM-0.5 mM) could determined decrease cathodic current -0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. first example biosensor used determination acetic acid ethanol-containing food samples. acetate-sensing electrode could used one month.
