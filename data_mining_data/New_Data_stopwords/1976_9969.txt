 postulate low intracellular pH acts preconditioner destructuve effects hyperthermia (42 degrees C) examined, using heat-sensitive line malignant cells derived rat mammary gland (SDB). Intracellular pH (pHi) measured indirectly, distribution weak, non-metabolizable organic acid 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) intra- extra-cellular water. Respiration, aerobic anaerobic anaerobic glycolysis cells studied normal pHi (pH 7-0-7-4) low pHi (pH 6-2-6-6) 38 degrees C 42 degrees C 6 h Warburg manometers; ability cells replicate culture examined 3 h 6 h incubation flasks. relationship pHi extracellular pH (pHe) depended upon buffer system used exact pH question; assumption regarding pHi based pHe measurement could made. 38 degrees C low pHi, Pasteur effect became negative due relatively greater inhibition anaerobic aerobic glycolysis. Respiration unaffected cell replicative ability unimpaired. 42 degrees C normal pHi, respiration totally inhibited 4 h Pasteur effect decreased, case due compensatory increase aerobic glycolysis without alteration anaerobic CO2 production. Low pHi presence hyperthermia enabled cell respiration continue reduced level change glycolysis. delayed cell replication 3 h 42 degrees C inability multiply following 6 h hyperthermia: low pHi influence results. concluded cancer cells, pHi values maintained region 1-0 pH unit normal 6 h deleterious effect cells. sensitizing effect low pHi destructive effect hyperthermia cells observed.
