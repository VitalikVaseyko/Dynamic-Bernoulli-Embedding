 BACKGROUND: Recently able demonstrate Tumor M2 Pyruvate Kinase (Tumor M2-PK) detectable feces patients gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. study ELISA based different combination antibodies used investigate stool samples GI cancer patients. PATIENTS METHODS: ELISA (ScheBoBiotech AG, Giessen, Germany) based one antibody specific Tumor M2-PK second antibody reacting Tumor M2-PK, M1-PK tetrameric M2-PK. Stool samples healthy controls, patients inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) different kinds GI cancer tested. RESULTS: Compared controls, samples IBD different tumors show significant differences, except patients gastric cancer (elevated fecal PK 80% (p = 0.005)). CONCLUSION: present results confirmed larger patient samples, new test might provide excellent screening tool gastric cancer.
