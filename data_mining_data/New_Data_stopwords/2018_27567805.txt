 Amyloid-beta peptide accumulation brain one main hallmarks Alzheimer's disease. amyloid aggregation process associated generation free radical species responsible mitochondrial impairment DNA damage turn activates poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1). PARP-1 catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosylation), post-translational modification proteins, cleaving substrate NAD+ transferring ADP-ribose moieties enzyme acceptor protein form branched polymers ADP-ribose. paper, demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction occurs Alzheimer's transgenic mice TgCRND8, SH-SY5Y treated amyloid-beta 7PA2 cells. Moreover, PARP-1 activation contributes functional energetic decline affecting cytochrome oxidase IV protein levels, oxygen consumption rates, membrane potential, resulting cellular bioenergetic deficit. also observed, first time, increase pyruvate kinase 2 expression, suggesting modulation glycolytic pathway PARP-1. PARP-1 inhibitors able restore mitochondrial impairment pyruvate kinase 2 expression. overall data presented indicate pivotal role enzyme bioenergetic network neuronal cells open new perspectives investigating molecular mechanisms underlying energy charge decline Alzheimer's disease. scenario, PARP-1 inhibitors might represent novel therapeutic intervention rescue cellular energetic metabolism.
