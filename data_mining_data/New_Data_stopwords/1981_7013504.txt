 Regulation coenzyme (CoA) synthesis studied isolated perfused rat heart. Incorporation [14C]pantothenic acid ([14C]PA) CoA determined estimate rates CoA synthesis. Although CoA levels elevated hearts removed fasted diabetic animals, vitro rates CoA synthesis elevated. presence 1.2 mM palmitate, 5 mM pyruvate, 10 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate perfusate-reduced PA incorporation CoA control hearts 40, 60, 80%, respectively. Insulin (25 mU/ml) reduced incorporation 90%. alterations CoA synthesis hearts perfused buffer containing palmitate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin associated change myocardial PA uptake. Data indicate substrates insulin inhibit first step pathway CoA synthesis, pantothenate kinase. insulin strong inhibitor CoA synthesis vitro, decreased circulating levels insulin fasted diabetic animals may account increased levels CoA vivo.
