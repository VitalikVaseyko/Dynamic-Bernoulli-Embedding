 Glycosomes mitochondrial vesicles cultured promastigotes Leishmania mexicana mexicana separated using isopycnic centrifugation linear sucrose gradients. Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.2), glucose phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.49) recovered largely association glycosomes (density; 1.215 g/ml). Phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) small glycosomal activity, mostly recovered soluble fractions. Malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) showed broad peak corresponding mitochondrial marker oligomycin-sensitive ATPase (EC 3.6.1.4) (density; 1.190 g/ml). Glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2) showed small mitochondrial peaks, activities recovered elsewhere gradient soluble fractions. subcellular location enzymes L.m. mexicana amastigotes investigated following release soluble enzymes digitonin-treated amastigotes. revealed distinct cytosolic, mitochondrial, glycosomal compartments. findings give insight organization control L.m. mexicana promastigote amastigote energy metabolism.
