 Pyruvate kinase binds one adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) molecule active site another ancillary site subunit. order determine conformation ATP bound sites, proton transferred two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (TRNOESY) measurements made 500 MHz 10 degrees C several mixing times range 40-200 ms. NOE values proton pair H1'-H2' ribose (which 2.9 +/- 0.2 apart, irrespective nucleotide conformation) function ligand concentration (1-10 mM ATP), ratio ligand enzyme kept constant, indicate higher ligand concentrations adventitious binding ATP nonspecific site(s) makes major contribution observed NOEs. ligand concentration < 2 mM, site-specific NOEs measured. Furthermore, addition phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) enzyme-MgATP sample results competitive displacement MgATP active site reduces observed NOE arising exclusively ancillary site, thus allowing measurement site-specific NOEs. interproton distances determined site-specific NOE buildup curves used constraints CHARMm obtain structure MgATP. active site, MgATP glycosidic torsion chi = 44 +/- 5 degrees phase angle pseudorotation ribose P = 42.4 degrees. ancillary site chi = 46 +/- 5 degrees P = 127.6 degrees. Thus orientation adenine respect sugar moiety sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
