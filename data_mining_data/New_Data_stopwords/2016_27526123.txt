 High cellular membrane cholesterol known generate membrane resistance reduce oxygen (O2) permeability. such, cholesterol may contribute Warburg effect tumor cells stimulating intracellular hypoxia cannot detected extracellular oxygen measurements. probe tissue-level impact phenomenon, asking whether layering cells magnify influence cholesterol, modulate hypoxia relation capillary proximity. Using molecular dynamics simulations, affirm minimally hydrated, adjacent lipid bilayers independent physical behavior. Combining insight published experimental data, predict linearly increasing impact membrane cholesterol oxygen flux across cells layered tissue.
