 key regulatory elements PKD2 transcription remain unclear. identify core elements, characterized porcine PKD2 promoter bioinformatics molecular tools found porcine PKD2 promoter bearing typical features enriched CpG less TATA. studies demonstrated core region located fragment -483 +100. Subsequent biophysical binding assays mutation experiments revealed G4 motif Sp1 critical regulators mediating transcription porcine PKD2. Moreover, regulatory pattern reproduced human PKD2 promoter region, indicating critical role G4 Sp1 regulating PKD2.
