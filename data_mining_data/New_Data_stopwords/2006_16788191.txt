 filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 fix N(2) combined nitrogen available growth medium. family 13 genes encoding proteins Ser/Thr kinase domain kinase domain. function enzymes unknown. Two encoded pkn41 (alr0709) pkn42 (alr0710). two genes separated 72 bp chromosome, results indicate cotranscribed. expression pkn41 pkn42 induced iron deprivation irrespective nature nitrogen source. Mutants inactivating either pkn41, pkn42, grow similarly wild type normal conditions, growth impaired either presence iron chelator conditions nitrogen fixation iron limitation, two situations demand iron particularly strong. Consistent results, mutants display lower iron content wild type higher level expression nifJ1 nifJ2, encode pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductases. nifJ1 nifJ2 known induced iron limitation. NtcA, global regulatory factor different metabolic pathways, binds putative promoter region pkn41, induction pkn41 response iron limitation longer occurs ntcA mutant. results suggest ntcA regulates expression genes involved nitrogen carbon metabolism also coordinates iron acquisition nitrogen metabolism activating expression pkn41 pkn42.
