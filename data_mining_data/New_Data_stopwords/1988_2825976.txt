 Activities key carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes biopsied human tissues hepatocellular carcinoma related conditions determined established methods. Among enzymes analyzed, fetal-type liver enzymes (low-Km hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase-M2) showed increased activities, adult-type liver enzymes [glucose 6-phosphatase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, high-Km hexokinase (or glucokinase), pyruvate kinase-L] showed decreased activities, resulting undifferentiated enzyme patterns fetal livers hepatocellular carcinomas also livers acute chronic hepatitis liver cirrhosis without tumors. Hepatocellular carcinomas showed general tendency greater enzyme deviations hepatitic cirrhotic livers. extent enzyme deviation hepatocellular carcinomas varied considerably one enzyme another tumor tissue compared benign liver diseases. Thus, phenotypic heterogeneity important discriminating neoplastic inflammatory changes differentiation markers. enzyme patterns tumors corresponding host cirrhotic livers unrelated, suggesting cirrhotic liver significance preneoplastic state terms high incidence evolving hepatocellular carcinoma.
