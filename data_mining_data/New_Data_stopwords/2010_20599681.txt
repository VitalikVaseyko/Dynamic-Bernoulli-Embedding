 paper describes problems measuring allosteric ATP-inhibition cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) isolated mitochondria. using ATP-regenerating system phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase full ATP-inhibition CcO could demonstrated kinetic measurements. mechanism proposed keep mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) living cells tissues low values (100-140 mV), matrix ATP/ADP ratios high. contrast, high DeltaPsi(m) values (180-220 mV) generally measured isolated mitochondria. using tetraphenyl phosphonium electrode observed isolated rat liver mitochondria glutamate plus malate substrates reversible decrease DeltaPsi(m) 233 123 mV addition phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. decrease DeltaPsi(m) explained reversal gluconeogenetic enzymes pyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase yielding ATP GTP, thus increasing matrix ATP/ADP ratio. rat heart mitochondria, lack enzymes, decrease DeltaPsi(m) found. data conclude high matrix ATP/ADP ratios keep DeltaPsi(m) low values allosteric ATP-inhibition CcO, thus preventing generation reactive oxygen species could generate degenerative diseases. proposed respiration living eukaryotic organisms normally controlled DeltaPsi(m)-independent "allosteric ATP-inhibition CcO." allosteric ATP-inhibition switched stress, respiration regulated "respiratory control," based DeltaPsi(m) according Mitchell Theory.
