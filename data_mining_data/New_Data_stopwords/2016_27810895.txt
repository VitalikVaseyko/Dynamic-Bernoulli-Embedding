 pyruvate kinase (PK) rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme catalyzing dephosphorylation phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, yielding one molecule ATP. M2 isoform PK (PKM2) predominantly expressed normal proliferating cells tumors, metabolic non-metabolic activities enzyme promoting tumor cell proliferation identified. However, exact roles PKM2 tumor initiation, growth maintenance yet fully understood. Using immunoprecipitation-coupled LC-MS/MS MCF7 cells exposed DNA-damaging agent, report nuclear PKM2 interacts directly P53 protein, critical safeguard genome stability. Specifically, PKM2 inhibits P53-dependent transactivation P21 gene preventing P53 binding P21 promoter, leading nonstop G1 phase. result, PKM2 expression provides growth advantage tumor cells presence DNA damage stimulus. addition, PKM2 interferes phosphorylation P53 serine 15, known stimulate P53 activity ATM serine/threonine kinase. findings reveal new role PKM2 modulating DNA damage response illustrate novel mechanism PKM2 participating tumorigenesis.
