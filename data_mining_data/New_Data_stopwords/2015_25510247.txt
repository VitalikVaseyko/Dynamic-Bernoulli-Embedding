 BACKGROUND: Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), biodegradable bio-plastic, one common homopolymer polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). PHB synthesized variety microorganisms intracellular carbon energy storage compounds response environmental stresses. Bio-based production PHB renewable feedstock promising sustainable alternative petroleum-based chemical synthesis plastics. study, novel strategy applied improve PHB biosynthesis different carbon sources. RESULTS: research, constructed E. coli strains produce PHB engineering Serine-Deamination (SD) pathway, Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Firstly, co-overexpression sdaA (encodes L-serine deaminase), L-serine biosynthesis genes pgk (encodes phosphoglycerate kinase) activated SD Pathway, resulting strain SD02 (pBHR68), harboring PHB biosynthesis genes Ralstonia eutropha, produced 4.86 g/L PHB using glucose sole carbon source, representing 2.34-fold increase compared reference strain. addition, activating ED pathway together overexpressing PDH complex increased PHB production 5.54 g/L content 81.1% CDW. intracellular acetyl-CoA concentration [NADPH]/[NADP(+)] ratio enhanced modification SD pathway, ED pathway PDH complex. Meanwhile, engineering strains also significant increase PHB concentration content xylose glycerol used carbon source. CONCLUSIONS: Significant levels PHB biosynthesis different kinds carbon sources achieved engineering Serine-Deamination pathway, Entner-Doudoroff pathway pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E. coli JM109 harboring PHB biosynthesis genes Ralstonia eutropha. work demonstrates novel strategy improving PHB production E. coli. strategy reported useful bio-based production PHB renewable resources.
