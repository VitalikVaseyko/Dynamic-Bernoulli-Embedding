 thermosensitive G1-arrested cdc35-10 mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae, defective adenylate cyclase activity, shifted restrictive temperature. 1 h incubation temperature, plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity cdc35-10 reduced 50%, whereas mitochondria doubled. Similar data obtained cdc25, another thermosensitive G1-arrested mutant modified cAMP pathway. contrast, ATPase activities G1-arrested mutant cdc19, defective pyruvate kinase, affected 2 h incubation restrictive temperature. double mutants cdc35-10 cas1 cdc25 cas1, addition extracellular cAMP prevented modifications ATPase activities observed single mutants cdc35-10 cdc25. data indicate cAMP acts positive effector H+-ATPase activity plasma membranes negative effector mitochondria.
