 conformation adenosine 5'-triphosphate manganese complex pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle determined six metal nucleus distances derived nuclear magnetic relaxation techniques. enzyme, direct metal-ATP coordination exists. phosphorous atoms ATP 4.9 5.1 away manganese, distance indicates either predominantly (greater equal 94%) second sphere complex or, less likely, highly distorted inner sphere complex. Thus, water ligands ligands protein might intervene ATP molecule divalent metal ion facilitate interaction. metal-gammaP distance 5 pyruvate kinase-bound ATP equal found phosphorous atom phosphoenolpyruvate cobalt(II) pyruvate kinase (Melamud, E., Mildvan, A. S. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8193-8201), consistent overlap space P-enolpyruvate-phosphorus gammaP ATP active site. observation explains competitive binding two substrates enzyme, detected NMR early kinetic studies. phosphorus data measurements relaxation rates 3 protons ATP pyruvate kinase-metal-ATP complex, conformation ATP characterized extended distances 6.0, 9.1, 7.5 manganese H8, H2, H'1 protons, respectively. torsion angle glycosidic bond (chi) defines conformation enzyme-bound riboside adenine rings determined 30 degrees. contrast, conformation binary Mn(II)-ATP complex solution folded around metal direct manganese coordination alpha-, beta-, gamma-phosphorus atoms, metal proton distances 4.5, 6.4, 6.2 H8, H2, H'1 protons, suggesting second sphere manganese-adenine interaction. chi angle equals 90 degrees binary complex primarily metal-base interaction. Thus, profound change conformation structure Mn(II)-ATP folded chelate extended second sphere complex results nucleotide binds pyruvate kinase.
