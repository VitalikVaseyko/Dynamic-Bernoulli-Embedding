 Numerous mechanism-based anticancer drugs target phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway clinical trials. However, remains challenging assess responses traditional imaging methods. Here, show first time efficacy hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) detecting effect PI3K inhibition monitoring hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]lactate levels produced hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. GS-2 glioblastoma cells, PI3K inhibition LY294002 everolimus caused hyperpolarized lactate drop 42 +/- 12% 76 +/- 5%, respectively. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, hyperpolarized lactate dropped 71 +/- 15% treatment LY294002. reductions correlated reductions LDH activity 48 +/- 4%, 63 +/- 4%, 69 +/- 12%, respectively, associated drop levels LDHA mRNA LDHA hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha proteins. Supporting findings, tumor growth inhibition achieved everolimus murine GS-2 xenografts associated drop hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio detected vivo MRS imaging, whereas increase ratio occurred tumor growth control animals. Taken together, findings illustrate application hyperpolarized (13)C MRS pyruvate monitor alterations LDHA activity expression caused PI3K pathway inhibition, showing potential method noninvasive imaging drug target modulation.
