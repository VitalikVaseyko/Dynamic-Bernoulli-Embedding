 Muscle fiber-type changes hypoxic conditions accordance pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Pdk)-1 hypoxia inducible factor (Hif)-1alpha investigated rats. Hif-1alpha down-stream molecule Pdk-1 well known readily response hypoxia. questioned roles relation changes myosin heavy chain (MyHC) composition skeletal muscles. hypothesize level Pdk-1 respect level Hif-1alpha determines MyHC composition muscle rats hypoxia. Young male rats housed chamber maintained 11.5% (for sustained hypoxia) fluctuating 11.5 20.8% (for intermittent hypoxia IH) oxygen levels. Then, muscle tissues geniohyoid (GH), soleus, anterior tibialis (TA) obtained end hypoxic conditionings. hypoxic conditionings, protein levels Pdk-1 Hif-1 increased GH muscles. GH muscles acute sustained hypoxia favor anaerobic glycolytic pathway, resulting increase glycolytic MyHC IIb protein-rich fibers maintain original fatigue-resistant MyHC IIa protein fibers; thus, numbers IIa- IIb MyHC co-expressing fibers increased. Exogenous Pdk-1 over-expression using plasmid vectors elevated glycolytic MyHC IIb, also IIx well IIa expressions C2C12 myotubes ambient air significantly. increase dual expression IIa- IIb MyHC proteins fibers harvested geniohyoid muscle potential improve endurance shown fatigability tests. increasing Pdk-1/Hif-1 ratio, mixed-type muscle could alter endurance within innate characteristics muscle toward fatigue resistant. conclude increased Pdk-1 level skeletal muscle helps maintain MyHC compositions fatigue resistant mixed-type muscle.
