 Seed germination well regulated process, incorporates many events including signal transduction, mobilization reserves, reactive oxygen species scavenging cell division. Although many transcriptomic proteomic studies conducted process, regulation protein modification studied. better understand mechanism, gel-based comparative phosphoproteomic study performed rice embryo germination process. total, 168 protein spots exhibited significantly changed Pro-Q staining intensity germination. Using matrix-assisted laser deionization-time flight/time flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) analysis, 193 proteins identified. combining Pro-Q Coomassie brilliant blue stain intensity analyses, 109 proteins verified phosphorylation regulation proteins. Functional analyses indicated phosphorylation proteins involved stress response storage gradually enhanced. Phosphorylation signal transduction proteins mainly activated early stage germination, stress response storage protein phosphorylation enhanced late stage. Enzyme assays proved phosphorylation fructokinase, pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase, GDP-mannose 3,5-epimerase1, ascorbate peroxidase glutathione S-transferase could consistently enhance activity. study showed dynamic changes protein phosphorylation status rice embryo germination provided new insight understanding mechanism underlying process.
