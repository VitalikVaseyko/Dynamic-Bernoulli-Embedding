 effects dietary vitamin E beta-carotene studied enzymes involved arachidonic acid metabolism related enzymes rat testis. Groups rats fed various soybean oil-based semi purified diets. Group 1 fed vitamin E-supplemented diet (+E - beta); Group 2 fed beta-carotene-supplemented diet (-E + beta); Group 3, control group (-E - beta) fed vitamin E-deficient diet; Group 4, standard diet group (S), fed vitamin E plus beta-carotene-standard diet. Soybean oxidized oil added three diet groups - (+E - beta), (- E + beta) (- E - beta), whereas diet group contained non-oxidized oil. 8 weeks rats killed, blood testis samples collected biochemical determinations. Vitamin E deficiency caused significant increase testis thiobarbituric acid value activities testis NADPH oxidase, testis 15-lipoxygenase plasma pyruvate kinase. contrast, significant decreases observed activity testis prostaglandin synthetase, compared antioxidant-supplemented diet groups. also found significant increase 15-lipoxygenase activity (- E + beta) diet group, compared (- E - beta) diet group. Fatty acid analysis testis parenchyma indicated decrease palmitate (16:0) arachidonate (20:4(n - 6)), increase oleate (18:1(n-6)) linoleate (18:2(n - 6)) linolenate (18:3(n - 3)), compared (-E - beta) diet group vitamin E-supplemented diet groups. results suggest dietary vitamin E role enzymatic non-enzymatic peroxidation polyunsaturated fatty acids testis.
