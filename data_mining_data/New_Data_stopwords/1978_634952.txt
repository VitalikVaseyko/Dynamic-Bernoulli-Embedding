 content estradiol receptors mammary glands virgin female mice, capacity hormone induce RNA synthesis, hexokinase, pyruvatkinase, glucose-6-phosphoric dehydrogenase glands studied. H3-estradiol binding mammary glands found highly specific: estradiol, and, lesser degree, estron, competed H2-estradiol binding sites, progesterone hydrocortisone failed affect binding H3-estradiol. determined method exchange receptor-bound endogenous hormone labeled exogenous one, value H3-estradiol specific binding 4.3+/-1.5 10(-15) M/mg protein. influence estradiol incorporation H3-adenine H3-orotic acid RNA mammary glands increased 70%, activity enzymes study almost doubled.
