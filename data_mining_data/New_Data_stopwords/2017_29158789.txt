 Background: Cancer cells proliferate rapidly resistant cell death, relying aggravated glycolysis satisfy increased demand energy biosynthetic precursors. However, process may create unfavorable microenvironments, increased acidity, leading cytotoxicity. previous study demonstrated arecoline induces anoikis HA22T/VGH hepatoma cells. present study aimed examine arecoline induced anoikis related glycolytic pathway explore underlying mechanisms. Methods: HA22T/VGH cells treated arecoline changes glycolytic end products lactate ATP, glycolytic-related gene expression, intracellular extracellular pH, pH-regulating gene expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) mitochondrial membrane potential examined, relative untreated cells. Cell viability morphology also assessed. Results: Arecoline increased lactate ATP production induction glycolytic genes, including glucose transporter 3 (Glut3), hexokinase 1 (HK1), hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase (PK). intracellular pH changed, despite increased lactate levels, implying intracellular H(+) exported cells. mRNA expression pH regulators including monocarboxylate transporter 1 4 (MCT 1 4), sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (NBC1), carbonic anhydrases (CA) IX XII vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) down-regulated. Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1) mRNA levels remained unchanged Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) up-regulated eventually [Ca(2+)]i increased. ROS generation increased mitochondrial membrane potential decreased followed cell detachment death. Addition 2-deoxy-d-glucose, glucose competitor interferes glycolysis, attenuated arecoline induction lactate [Ca(2+)]i, ROS cell detachment. Similarly, ROS scavengers could block effects arecoline. Conclusions: study demonstrated arecoline induced glycolysis modulated mRNA expression pH-regulator genes HA22T/VGH cells. phenomenon led elevation [Ca(2+)]i, ROS generation, subsequent cell detachment.
