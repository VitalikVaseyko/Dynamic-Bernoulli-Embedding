 enzymes hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) studied rat lung development starting day 16 gestation (day-6) 5 days birth. gestation, activities hexokinase type II, enolase pyruvate kinase decreased reached adult values birth shortly thereafter. Hexokinase type remained relatively constant decrease soluble type II hexokinase compensated increment particle-bound hexokinase starting day 20 gestation birth. contrast, phosphofructokinase activity increased day 20 gestation followed rapid fall activity 2 days birth. Except hexokinase isoenzyme shifts observed period observation. results discussed respect proposed relationship glycogen breakdown surfactant synthesis perinatal period suggest regulatory role phosphofructokinase process.
