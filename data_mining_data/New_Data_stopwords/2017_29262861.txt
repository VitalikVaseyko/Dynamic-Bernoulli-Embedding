 BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) functions well-known onco-protein regulate protein conformation, stability degradation. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), critical regulator metabolism, growth metastasis cancer cells, confirmed overexpressed various human cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, molecular mechanisms underlying oncogenic functions HSP90 PKM2 overexpression HCC remain unknown. METHODS: expression HSP90 PKM2 HCC specimens cells detected immunoblotting immunostaining. interaction HSP90 PKM2 confirmed tandem affinity purification, co-immunoprecipitation Glutathione transferase (GST)-pulldown assay. RESULTS: study, found HSP90 could bind PKM2 subsequently increased PKM2 abundance HCC cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed HSP90 level positively correlated PKM2 level HCC tissues. Mechanistically, HSP90 found increase phosphorylation PKM2 Thr-328. Protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) formed protein complex HSP90 PKM2, directly mediated Thr-328 phosphorylation PKM2 induced HSP90. Thr-328 phosphorylation critical maintaining PKM2 stability biological functions regulating glycolysis, mitochondria respiration, proliferation apoptosis. Functionally, found HSP90 promoted glycolysis proliferation inhibited apoptosis HCC cells PKM2 dependent manner. vivo experiments disclosed PKM2 required promoting effects HSP90 growth HCC cells mice. Furthermore, demonstrated positive expression HSP90 PKM2 correlated poor clinicopathological features including high alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, large tumor size, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Furthermore, demonstrated positive expression HSP90 PKM2, combination proteins could strongly predict poor prognosis HCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: suggest HSP90 potentiates glycolysis proliferation, reduces apoptosis thus enhances growth HCC cells PKM2.
