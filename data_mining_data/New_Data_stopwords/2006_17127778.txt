 OBJECTIVE: Pyruvate Kinase (PK) deficiency common enzymopathy glycolytic pathway erythrocytes. constitutes one common causes hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. aim study screen newborns India pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency relation unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. METHODS: Laboratory investigations done included complete blood counts, reticulocyte counts, direct indirect bilirubin, assay G6PD PK activity, ATP 2,3 DPG levels. variables studied 50-cord blood samples normal deliveries 218 neonates hyperbilirubinemia. RESULTS: 7 218 cases neonatal jaundice PK deficient 30-40% reduction PK activity. cases also 3-4-fold increase 2,3 DPG:ATP ratios, one additional indicators PK deficiency. Six 7 infants severe clinical course. CONCLUSION: study shows prevalence PK deficiency Indian neonatal jaundice cases 3.21%, relatively high. emphasizes need screening neonatal hyperbilirubinemia cases India PK deficiency.
