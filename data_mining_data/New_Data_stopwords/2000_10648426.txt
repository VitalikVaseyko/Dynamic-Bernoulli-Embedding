 Polytrauma (PT) leads systemic activation polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Organ damage commonly found patients ascribed respiratory bursts activated PMNs. use sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PMN extracts PT patients found contain clear protein band seen control PMNs healthy volunteers. band identified amino acid sequencing Western blotting pyruvate kinase (PK). Enzymatic assays revealed 600-fold increase PK activity PMNs PT patients, highest levels occurring fifth seventh posttraumatic day. lymphocytes, increase detectable. PK major regulatory enzyme glycolysis, glucose-dependent lactate production PMNs PT patients assayed. cells showed higher glycolytic lactate production controls. additionally demonstrated acute activation respiratory burst activity depends mainly breakdown glucose lactate via pentose-phosphate pathway glycolysis. PMNs PT patients, glucose-dependent respiratory burst activity twofold higher controls. increase expression activity PK PMNs PT patients may contribute high glucose-dependent respiratory burst activity seen cells.
