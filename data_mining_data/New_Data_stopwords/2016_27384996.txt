 Vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), hetero-multimeric ATP-driven proton pump recently emerged critical regulator mTOR-induced amino acid sensing cell growth. Although dysregulated activity cell growth regulators often associated cancer, prognostic significance metabolic roles V-ATPase esophageal cancer progression remain unclear. Here, show high levels V-ATPase subunit V1E1 (V-ATPase V1E1) significantly associated shortened disease-free survival patients esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Multivariate analysis identified V-ATPase V1E1 independent adverse prognostic factor (hazard ratio;1.748, P = 0.018). addition, depletion V-ATPase V1E1 resulted reduced cell motility, decreased glucose uptake, diminished levels lactate, decreased ATP production, well inhibition glycolytic enzyme expression TE8 esophageal cancer cells. Consistent results, Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed high frequency copy number alterations V-ATPase V1E1 gene, identified correlation levels V-ATPase V1E1 mRNA Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) ESCC. High expression levels V-ATPase V1E1 phosphorylated PKM2 (p-PKM2), key player cancer metabolism, associated poorer prognosis ESCC. Collectively, findings suggest expression V-ATPase V1E1 prognostic significance ESCC, closely linked migration, invasion, aerobic glycolysis esophageal cancer cells.
