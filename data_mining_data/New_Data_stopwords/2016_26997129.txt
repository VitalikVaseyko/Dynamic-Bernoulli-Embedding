 Prior targeted treatment glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) anti-angiogenic agents, bevacizumab, met limited success potentially owing GBM tumor's ability develop hypoxia-induced escape mechanism--a glycolytic switch oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, old concept known Warburg effect. New studies points subpopulation cells source treatment-resistance, cancer stem cells (CSCs). Taken together, induction Warburg effect leads promotion CSC self-renewal undifferentiation. response hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible transcription factor upregulated central driver setting cascade events CSC metabolic reprogramming. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor upregulates GLUT1 increase glucose uptake cell, upregulates HK2 PK glycolysis, upregulates LDHA termination glycolysis, downregulates PDH redirect energy production toward glycolysis. review aims unite old new concepts simultaneously examine potential enzyme targets driven hypoxia glycolytic phenotype CSCs reverse metabolic shift induced Warburg effect.
