 Muscular glycolytic fuels, intermediates end-products (glycogen, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate), Krebs cycle intermediates (citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate), related free amino acids (glutamate, alanine), ammonia, energy store (creatine phosphate), energy mediators (ATP, ADP, AMP) energy charge potential evaluated. Furthermore maximum rate (Vmax) following enzyme activities evaluated crude extract and/or mitochondrial fraction: anaerobic glycolytic pathway: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; tricarboxylic acid cycle: citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase; electron transfer chain: total NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome oxidase. rat gastrocnemius muscles analysed normoxia normobaric intermittent hypoxia (12 hours continuously daily; 5 days). Cytidine and/or uridine administered daily dose 120 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min beginning experimental hypoxia. intermittent normobaric hypoxia induced biochemical adaptation characterized decrease muscular contents creatine phosphate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate glutamate. adaptation occurred absence significant changes Vmax tested muscle enzymes. gastrocnemius muscle hypoxic rats, two biological pyrimidines tested induced various discrete, often related, modifications contents Krebs cycle intermediates (i.e., alpha-ketoglutarate, malate) related free amino acids (i.e., glutamate, alanine). case, treatment cytidine and/or uridine modify Vmax marker enzymes related energy transduction.
