 Specific activities glycolytic enzymes fructose-1-phosphate aldolase, fructose-1,6-diphophate aldolase, pyruvate kinase, higher rat duodenum jejunum ileum. Whether gradient reflects failure dietary sugars reach ileum high concentrations unknown. Rats first fed carbohydrate-free diet 3 days, virtually removed proximal-distal gradient enzyme specific activities. Twenty percent glucose perfused directly either duodenum ileum 3 days. proximal distal glucose perfusion restored normal gradient three enzymes. Ileal pyruvate kinase also increased ileal glucose perfusion, ileal aldolases higher distal perfusion duodenal perfusion. low ileal aldolase levels normally found fed rats therefore intrinsic property distal intestine due failure dietary sugar reach portion gut. Furthermore, adaptation duodenal jejunal glycolytic enzymes ileal glucose perfusion suggests humoral and/or neural mechanism rather direct local luminal effect sugar itself.
