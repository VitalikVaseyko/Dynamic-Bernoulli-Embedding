 1. Measurements made activities four key enzymes involved gluconeogenesis, pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.32), fructose 1,6-diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) glucose 6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9), serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13) four enzymes unique glycolysis, glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2), hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), livers starved rats perfused glucose, fructose lactate. Changes perfusate concentrations glucose, fructose, lactate, pyruvate, urea amino acid monitored perfusion. 2. Addition 15mm-glucose start perfusion decreased activity pyruvate carboxylase. Constant infusion glucose maintain concentration also decreased activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase serine dehydratase. Addition 2.2mm-glucose initially give perfusate sugar concentration similar blood sugar concentration starved animals effect activities enzymes compared zero-time controls. 3. Addition 15mm-fructose initially decreased glucokinase activity. Constant infusion fructose decreased activities glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, glucose 6-phosphatase serine dehydratase. 4. Addition 7mm-lactate initially elevated activity pyruvate carboxylase, also constant infusion; maintenance perfusate lactate concentration 18mm induced pyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activities. 5. Addition cycloheximide effect activities enzymes 4h perfusion either low high concentrations glucose high lactate concentration. Cycloheximide also prevented loss induction pyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activities high substrate concentrations. 6. Significant amounts glycogen deposited perfusions, except containing cycloheximide lowest glucose concentration. Lipid found increase experiments high fructose concentrations. 7. Perfusion either fructose glucose decreased rates ureogenesis; addition cycloheximide increased urea efflux liver.
