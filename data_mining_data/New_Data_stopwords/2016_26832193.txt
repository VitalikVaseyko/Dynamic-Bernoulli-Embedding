 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency known common cause chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA). Clinical PK deficiency transmitted autosomal recessive trait, segregate neither homozygous compound heterozygous modality, respectively. Two PK genes present mammals: pyruvate kinase liver red blood cells (PK-LR) pyruvate kinase muscle (PK-M), first encodes isoenzymes normally expressed red blood cells (R-type) liver (L-type). Several reports published describing large variety genetic defects PK-LR gene associated CNSHA. Herein, present review 250 published mutations six polymorphisms PK-LR gene corresponding clinical molecular data. consulted PubMed website searching mutations papers, along two main databases: Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD, https://grenada.lumc.nl/LOVD2/mendelian_genes/home.php?select_db=PKLR) Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/gene.php?gene=PKLR) selecting, reviewing listing annotated PK-LR gene mutations present literature. paper aimed provide useful information clinicians laboratory professionals regarding overall reported PK-LR gene mutations, also giving opportunity harmonize data regarding PK-deficient individuals.
