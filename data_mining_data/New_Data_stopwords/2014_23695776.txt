 Sporolactobacillus inulinus attracted scientific commercial interest due high efficiency D-lactic acid production. Pyruvate kinase (PYK) one key regulatory points glycolysis, well-activated PYK improve D-lactic acid production. novel Mn(2+)/Mg(2+)-dependent PYK S. inulinus expressed Escherichia coli purified homogeneity. Kinetic characterization demonstrated S. inulinus PYK drastically higher activity affinity toward substrates presence Mn(2+) compared common PYK cofactor Mg(2+), circular dichroism spectra S. inulinus PYK suggested Mn(2+)-mediated allosteric activation. S. inulinus PYK also allosterically regulated ribose-5-phosphate AMP activation inorganic phosphate ATP inhibition. inhibition could marked reduced fully eliminated presence activators. result fermentations S. inulinus Y2-8 showed extracellular-added MnSO(4) KH(2)PO(4) significantly affected glycolysis flux D-lactic acid production, consistent allosteric regulation Mn(2+) inorganic phosphate PYK. sophisticated regulatory role PYK would establish foundation substantial disturbance restructuring cellular metabolism improving S. inulinus D-lactic acid production.
