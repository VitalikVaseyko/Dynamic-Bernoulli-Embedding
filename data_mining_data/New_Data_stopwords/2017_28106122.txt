 Despite long successful history citrate production Aspergillus niger, molecular mechanism citrate accumulation partially understood. study, used comparative genomics transcriptome analysis citrate-producing strains-namely, A. niger H915-1 (citrate titer: 157 g L(-1)), A1 (117 g L(-1)), L2 (76 g L(-1))-to gain genome-wide view mechanism citrate accumulation. Compared A. niger A1 L2, A. niger H915-1 contained 92 mutated genes, including succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase gamma-aminobutyric acid shunt pathway aconitase family protein involved citrate synthesis. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis A. niger H915-1 revealed transcription levels 479 genes changed cell growth stage (6 h) citrate synthesis stage (12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h). glycolysis pathway, triosephosphate isomerase up-regulated, whereas pyruvate kinase down-regulated. Two cytosol ATP-citrate lyases, take part cycle citrate synthesis, up-regulated, may coordinate alternative oxidases alternative respiratory pathway energy balance. Finally, deletion oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase gene H915-1 eliminated oxalate formation neither influence pH decrease difference citrate production observed.
