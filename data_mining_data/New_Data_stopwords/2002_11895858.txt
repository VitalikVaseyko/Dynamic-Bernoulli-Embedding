 Oval cells bipotential liver stem cells able differentiate hepatocytes bile duct epithelia. normal adult liver oval cells quiescent, existing low numbers around periportal region, proliferate following severe, prolonged liver trauma. evidence implicating oval cells development hepatocellular carcinoma, hence availability immortalized oval cell line would invaluable study liver cell lineage differentiation carcinogenesis. novel approach generation cell lines use p53 knockout mouse. Absence p53 allows cell cycle past normal Hayflick limit, rendering immortalized, although subsequent genetic alterations thought necessary transformation. p53 knockout mice fed choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet, previously shown increase oval cell numbers wild-type mice. oval cells isolated centrifugal elutriation maintained culture. Colonies hepatic cells isolated characterized respect phenotype, growth characteristics tumorigenicity. Analysis gene expression Northern blotting immunocytochemistry suggests oval-like cells virtue albumin transferrin expression, well oval cell markers alpha fetoprotein, M(2)-pyruvate kinase A6. Injection athymic nude mice shows cell lines capable forming tumors phenotypically resemble hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, use p53 null hepatic cells successfully generated immortalized tumorigenic hepatic stem cell lines. results presented support idea deleting p53 allows immortalization contributes transformation oval-like cell lines. Further, tumorigenic status cell lines direct evidence participation oval cells formation hepatocellular carcinoma.
