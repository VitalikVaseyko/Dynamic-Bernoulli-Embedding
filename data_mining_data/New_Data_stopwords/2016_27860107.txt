 balance metabolism biomass important biological systems; however, date quantitative method characterize balance. methodological study, propose use distribution amino acids different domains investigate balance. well known endogenous exogenous amino acids biological system either metabolized incorporated free amino acids (FAAs) proteome amino acids (PAAs). Using glycine (Gly) example, demonstrate novel method accurately determine amounts amino acids various domains using serum, urine, cell samples. expected, serum urine different distributions FAA- PAA-Gly. Using Tet21N human neuroblastoma cells, also found Myc(oncogene)-induced metabolic reprogramming included higher rate metabolizing Gly, provides additional evidence metabolism proliferating cells adapted facilitate producing new cells. therefore anticipated method valuable studies metabolism biomass balance lead better understanding human cancers.
