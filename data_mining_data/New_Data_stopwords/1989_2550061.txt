 Electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy, Mn2+ VO2+ paramagnetic probes, used examine active-site structures protein-based divalent cation site rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase presence substrates, products, requisite inorganic cofactors. Two different VO.protein complexes clearly distinguished, differed respect coordination active-site lysine VO2+. Lysine coordination sensitive presence pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) nature monovalent cation. presence MgATP oxalate, 4-MHz 31P contact interaction observed, indicates ATP directly coordinated Mn2+ protein-based site. 31P contact interactions observed, however, presence PEP. Pyruvate determined bidentate ligand VO2+, basis observation 2.2- 5.4-MHz 13C contact interactions VO2+ [1-13C]pyruvate [2-13C]pyruvate, respectively. Magnetic coupling VO2+ Mn2+ 23Na, 39K, 133Cs observed, demonstrating close proximity monovalent cation protein-based divalent cation.
