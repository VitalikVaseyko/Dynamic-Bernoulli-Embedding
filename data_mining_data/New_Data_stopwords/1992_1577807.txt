 recently identified glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) insulin-regulated enzyme adipocytes. Moreover, found loss GFAT activity due direct action insulin rather mediated enhanced glucose uptake subsequent routing glucose hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. assess whether cytosolic enzymes controlled formation hexosamine products, treated adipocytes 5 h physiological concentrations insulin (ED50 = 0.33 ng/ml), glucose (ED50 = 4.5 mM), glutamine (ED50 = 4.4 mM) measured pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Combined treatment resulted progressive (t 1/2 2.5 h) marked (3-fold) increase PK activity, whereas omission one components failed alter enzyme activity. Several lines additional evidence implicated hexosamine biosynthesis pathway PK regulation; therefore, appears M2 isoform pyruvate kinase represents another enzyme regulated insulin stimulation glucose uptake formation hexosamine products. Related studies revealed enhancement PK activity dependent upon ongoing mRNA synthesis de novo protein synthesis mediated increase enzyme content. Considered together, findings provide new insights cascade metabolic events triggered insulin implicated novel metabolic pathway pretranslational control enzyme function.
