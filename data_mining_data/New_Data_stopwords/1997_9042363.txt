 Liver cytosolic gamma-cystathionase catalyzes generation reduced sulfur species, referred "bound sulfur,' presence cystine. Incubating rat liver cytosol fraction presence cystine oxidized glutathione inactivated certain cytosolic enzyme activities. activities cytosolic phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase rapidly decreased pH 7.4 incubation lower concentration cystine incubation oxidized glutathione. Hexokinase 11 enzymes system affected minimally all. Adding dithiothreitol system reactivated modified enzymes. Inactivated PFK activity could also recovered reduced glutathione NADPH added cytosol fraction. reconstitution systems, purified rat liver PFK directly inactivated cystine trisulfide (one low molecular types bound sulfur), cystine (below 0.1 mM). Purified PFK also inactivated incubation cystine plus gamma-cystathionase freshly prepared cytosol. observed, however, gamma-cystathionase pretreated specific inhibitor, D,L-propargylglycine. cystine-dependent inactivation PFK observed liver cytosol shown caused mainly reaction bound sulfur enzyme, direct thiol/disulfide exchange. Thus, vitro modification cytosolic enzymes bound sulfur generated cystine gamma-cystathionase high potency relatively specific.
