 Aflatoxin production pregrown cultures Aspergillus parasiticus completely inhibited incorporation 2 mg caffeine per ml medium. accompanied decrease glucose utilization inhibition oxygen uptake carbon dioxide evolution. Enzyme analyses indicated significant differences specific activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, mannitol dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase. Glucose uptake kinetics indicated linear dose-related inhibition glucose uptake. appears likely caffeine inhibits aflatoxin synthesis restricting uptake carbohydrates ultimately used mold synthesize family mycotoxins.
