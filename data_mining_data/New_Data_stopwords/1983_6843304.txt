 effect feeding diets containing various levels vitamin E 6 months vitro synthesis sulfolipids rat submandibular salivary glands (SMG) elucidated. incorporation [35S]sulfate sulfolipid SMG rats deficient "normal" vitamin E diets quite similar, however, uptake significantly increased glands rats diets high vitamin E. Whereas, many instances, antioxidants mimic effect vitamin E, present study, antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine (DPPD) actually found significantly depress sulfolipid-labeling noted SMG diets. results suggest synthesis SMG sulfolipid action vitamin E may simple antioxidant.
