 present work Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum engineered efficient, tailor-made production strain diaminopentane (cadaverine), highly attractive building block bio-based polyamides. engineering comprised expression lysine decarboxylase (ldcC) Escherichia coli, catalyzing conversion lysine diaminopentane, systems-wide metabolic engineering central supporting pathways. Substantially re-designing metabolism yielded superior strains desirable properties (i) release unwanted feedback regulation level aspartokinase pyruvate carboxylase introducing point mutations lysC311 pycA458, (ii) optimized supply key precursor oxaloacetate amplifying anaplerotic enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase, deleting phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase otherwise removes oxaloacetate, (iii) enhanced biosynthetic flux via combined amplification aspartokinase, dihydrodipicolinate reductase, diaminopimelate dehydrogenase diaminopimelate decarboxylase, (iv) attenuated flux threonine pathway competing production leaky mutation hom59 homoserine dehydrogenase gene. Lysine decarboxylase proved bottleneck efficient production, since vitro activity vivo flux closely correlated. achieve optimal strain stable genomic modifications, combination strong constitutive C. glutamicum tuf promoter optimized codon usage allowed efficient genome-based ldcC expression resulted high diaminopentane yield 200 mmol mol(-1). supplementing medium 1 mgL(-1) pyridoxal, cofactor lysine decarboxylase, yield increased 300 mmol mol(-1). production strain obtained, lysine secretion almost completely abolished. Metabolic analysis, however, revealed substantial formation yet unknown by-product. identified acetylated variant, N-acetyl-diaminopentane, reached levels 25% desired product.
