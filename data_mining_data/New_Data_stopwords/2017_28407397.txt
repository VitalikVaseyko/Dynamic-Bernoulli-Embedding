 Many studies allosteric mechanisms use limited numbers mutations test whether residues play "key" roles. However, large percentage protein contributes allosteric function, mutating residue would high probability modifying allostery. Thus, predicted mechanism dependent residues could erroneously appear supported. used whole-protein alanine-scanning mutagenesis determine amino acid sidechains human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK; approved symbol PKLR) contribute regulation fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP; activator) alanine (inhibitor). nonalanine/nonglycine residue hL-PYK mutated alanine generate 431 mutant proteins. Allosteric functions active proteins quantified following substrate affinity concentration range effectors. Results show different residues contribute two allosteric functions. small fraction mutated residues perturbed inhibition alanine. contrast, large percentage mutated residues influenced activation Fru-1,6-BP; inhibition alanine simply reverse activation Fru-1,6-BP. Moreover, results show Fru-1,6-BP activation would extremely difficult elucidate using limited number mutations. Additionally, large mutational data set useful train test computational algorithms aiming predict allosteric mechanisms.
