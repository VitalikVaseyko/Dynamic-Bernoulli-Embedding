 BACKGROUND: Recent advances genomics proteomics allowed us study nuances Warburg effect--a long-standing puzzle cancer energy metabolism--at unprecedented level detail. modern next-generation sequencing technologies extremely powerful, lack appropriate data analysis tools makes study difficult. meet challenge, developed novel application comparative analysis gene expression visualization RNA-Seq data. RESULTS: analyzed two biological samples (normal human brain tissue human cancer cell lines) high-energy, metabolic requirements. calculated digital topology copy number every expressed transcript. observed subtle remarkable qualitative quantitative differences citric acid (TCA) cycle glycolysis pathways. found first three steps TCA cycle, digital expression aconitase 2 (ACO2) brain exceeded citrate synthase (CS) isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), cancer cells trend quite opposite. glycolysis pathway, genes showed higher expression levels cancer cell lines; notably, digital gene expression glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) enolase (ENO) considerably increased compared brain sample. CONCLUSIONS: variations observed affect rates quantities ATP production. expect developed tool provide insights subtleties related causality Warburg effect neoplastic transformation. Even though focused well-known extensively studied metabolic pathways, data analysis visualization pipeline developed particularly valuable global pathway-independent.
