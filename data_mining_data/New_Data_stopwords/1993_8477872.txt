 Liver insulin resistance glucagon-stimulated hepatic glucose production characteristics diabetic state. determine potential role glucose toxicity abnormalities, examined whether phlorizin treatment streptozotocin-diabetic rats resulted altered expression genes involved key steps hepatic glucose metabolism. inhibiting renal tubular glucose reabsorption, phlorizin infusion diabetic rats induced normoglycaemia, significantly alter low circulating insulinaemia, caused marked decrease hyperglucagonaemia. Glucokinase L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA levels reduced respectively 90% 70% fed diabetic rats, close correlation changes enzyme activities. Eighteen days phlorizin infusion partially restored glucokinase mRNA activity (40% control levels), effect L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA activity. contrast glycolytic enzymes, mRNA activity gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase increased (10- 2.2-fold, respectively) fed diabetic rats. Phlorizin administration decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA values different control rats, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity remained 50% higher control rats. 50% rise liver glucose transporter (GLUT 2) mRNA protein, produced diabetes, also corrected phlorizin treatment. conclusion, propose phlorizin treatment diabetic rats may induce partial shift predominating gluconeogenesis, associated hepatic glucose overproduction, glycolysis, correction impaired pre-translational regulatory mechanisms. could essentially mediated improved pancreatic alpha-cell function subsequent lowering hyperglucagonaemia. observations suggest glucagon-stimulated hepatic glucose production may result, part, glucose toxicity.
