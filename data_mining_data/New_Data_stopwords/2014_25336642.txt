 O-Linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) carbohydrate post-translational modification hydroxyl groups serine and/or threonine residues cytosolic nuclear proteins. Analogous phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation plays crucial regulatory roles cellular signaling. Recent work indicates increased O-GlcNAcylation general feature cancer contributes transformed phenotypes. minireview, discuss hyper-O-GlcNAcylation may linked various hallmarks cancer, including cancer cell proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis; energy metabolism; epigenetics. also discuss potential therapeutic modulation O-GlcNAc levels cancer treatment.
