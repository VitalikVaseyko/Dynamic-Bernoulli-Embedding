 OBJECTIVE: adaptive mechanisms response excess energy supply still poorly known humans. aims define metabolic responses changes gene expression skeletal muscle healthy volunteers fat overfeeding. RESEARCH METHODS PROCEDURES: Eight lean young healthy men given diet rich saturated fat excess approximately 550 kcal/d 4 weeks. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, gene expression changes skeletal muscle analyzed Day 0, Day 14, Day 28. RESULTS: Fat overfeeding led increase body weight (1.0 +/- 0.3 kg) waist circumference (2.2 +/- 0.5 cm, p = 0.005) significant decrease fasting non-esterified fatty acid plasma levels (-29 +/- 5%, p = 0.028). Respiratory quotient significantly increased (0.84 +/- 0.01 0.88 +/- 0.02, p = 0.034) lipid oxidation rate tended decrease. expression 55 genes modified skeletal muscle. main pathways indicated coordinated stimulation triacylglycerol synthesis, inhibition lipolysis, reduction fatty acid oxidation, development adipocytes. Promoter analysis regulated genes suggests sterol regulatory element binding proteins might important players short-term adaptation fat overfeeding human skeletal muscle. DISCUSSION: combined metabolic genomic investigation shows fat overfeeding 28 days promotes storage excess energy lean men demonstrates usefulness transcriptomic approach better understanding metabolic adaptation changes nutritional behavior human.
