 action dichloroacetate (DCA) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity rat brain studied vitro vivo. crude brain mitochondrial fraction, DCA inhibits PDH kinase rat brain slices compound increases PDH activity stimulates glucose oxidation. whole animal, intraperitoneal injection DCA causes activation brain PDH, indicating inhibitor crosses blood-brain barrier. treatment DCA also produced large increase heart PDH activity. studies effects DCA CNS lead results considerable importance.
