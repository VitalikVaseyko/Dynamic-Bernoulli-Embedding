 Bacitracin proteolytic inhibitor interacts intracellular processing insulin. effects pyruvate, fatty acid amino acid metabolism examined rat hepatocyte suspensions. Bacitracin (0.25-1.0 mM) increased oxidation [1-14C]pyruvate 50-70% presumably therefore increased flux pyruvate dehydrogenase. found presence extracellular Ca2+ absence, presence 2 mM-2-chloropropionate, inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Insulin stimulate [1-14C]pyruvate oxidation presence 1 mM-bacitracin. Bacitracin decreased 14CO2 formation [2-14C]pyruvate (20-40%) [U-14C]palmitate (30-70%), suggesting decreased flux tricarboxylic acid cycle. Fatty acid oxidation acetyl-CoA formation also decreased. Bacitracin decreased incorporation label [3H]leucine protein absence insulin, presence. Bacitracin commonly used studies insulin action. results suggest studies effects noted may related interaction bacitracin intracellular processing insulin also direct metabolic effects bacitracin independent insulin.
