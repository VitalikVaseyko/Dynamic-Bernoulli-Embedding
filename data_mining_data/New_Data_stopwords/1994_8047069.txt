 effects urea, cations (K+,NH4,Na+,Cs+,Li+), trimethylamines maximal activities kinetic properties pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) skeletal muscle analyzed two anuran amphibians, estivating species, spadefoot toad Scaphiopus couchii, semi-aquatic species, leopard frog Rana pipiens. Urea, accumulates naturally levels 200-300 mM estivation toads, minor effects Vmax, kinetic constants pH curves PK either species effects PFK Vmax kinetic constants. Trimethylamine oxide neither affected enzyme activity directly changed enzyme response urea. contrast, high KCl (200 mM) lowered Vmax toad PFK PK species altered Km values substrates frog PFK. cations even inhibitory; example, Vmax PK either species reduced 80% addition 200 mM NH4Cl, NaCl, CsCi, LiCl. High KCl also significantly changed Km values substrates toad lactate dehydrogenase strongly reduced Vmax glutamate dehydrogenase NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase species whereas 300 mM urea relatively little effect enzymes. perturbing effect urea enzymes counteracting effect trimethylamines reported elasmobranch fishes (that maintain high concentrations solutes naturally) appear apply amphibian enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
