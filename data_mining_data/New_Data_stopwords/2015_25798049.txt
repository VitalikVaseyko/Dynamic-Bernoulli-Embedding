 Sugarcane one important crops cultivated production sugar ethanol. previous studies, innovative positive selection system obtaining transgenic sugarcane, utilized E. coli-derived manA gene selectable marker mannose selective agent, developed patented China. paper, influence phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) overexpression key enzymes glycolysis sucrose metabolism investigated transgenic sugarcane manA gene. Overexpressed PMI increased hexokinase activity approximately 24 % compared non-transgenic control plants, pyruvate kinase (PK) activity reduced approximately 14 %. comparison non-transgenic control plants, activities sucrose synthase, sucrose-phosphate synthase, acid invertase also modestly affected PMI-overexpressing transgenic plants, significant differences observed stalk elongation maturity stages. However, agronomic technical traits affected manA gene overexpression transgenic sugarcane. conclusion, PMI overexpression significantly affected hexokinase PK activities catalyzing reversible interconversion mannose-6-phosphate fructose-6-phosphate, intermediate glycolysis. However, significant effects sucrose accumulation sugarcane.
