 Long-term caloric restriction (CR) shown extend maximum life span laboratory rodents. investigated activities gluconeogenic transaminase enzymes livers old young mice fed either control calorie-restricted diets. Livers sampled 48 h last scheduled feeding time. Old mice CR showed significant increases activities pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase glucose-6-phosphatase compared controls, indicating increased gluconeogenesis. Increased activities tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, phenylalanine, alanine aspartate transaminases, well malate glutamate dehydrogenases also observed, branched-chain amino acid transaminase unchanged. Young mice CR showed significant increase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity gluconeogenic pathway, transaminases increased significantly, except tryptophan branched-chain amino acid transaminases. Glutamate dehydrogenase also showed increased activity malate dehydrogenase unchanged. Increases level acetyl-CoA [Acetyl-CoA]/[CoA] ratio observed old CR mice. results demonstrate increased gluconeogenic activity CR mice consistent state increased hepatic gluconeogenesis protein turnover CR.
