 Altered erythrocyte sodium potassium (Na,K)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity cited pathophysiologic significance morbidly obese man. Previous studies failed consider obese patients weight loss and, therefore, clarify role ATPase deficiency cause effect obese state. define completely possible alteration cellular thermogenesis obesity, study made three groups people: (1) normal weight controls; (2) morbidly obese; (3) formerly morbidly obese patients lost 100 pounds gastric bypass surgery. Erythrocyte ATPase activity determined use assay coupled ATPase activity NADH oxidation presence excess pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate. coupled assay produced continuous slope activity could calculated initial, maximal, linear portion decay trace. Results demonstrate statistically significant differences Na,K-ATPase activity groups analysis variance. nonsignificant correlation 0.086 seen obesity index Na,K-ATPase activity. concluded (1) erythrocyte Na,K-ATPase activity similar normal obese individuals, (2) erythrocyte Na,K-ATPase change weight loss, (3) therefore, disordered erythrocyte thermogenesis role development maintenance obesity.
