 present study, comparative proteomic analysis performed rats subjected water immersionrestraint stress (WRS). total 26 proteins differentially expressed identified using matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectrometry. Among 26 differentially expressed protein spots identified, 13 proteins significantly upregulated WRS, including pyruvate kinase calreticulin, may closely associated energy metabolism. addition, 12 proteins downregulated WRS, including hemoglobin subunit beta2 keratin type II cytoskeletal 8, may important protein metabolism cell death. Gene Ontology analysis revealed cellular distribution, molecular function biological processes identified proteins. mRNA levels certain differentially expressed proteins analyzed using fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. results present study aimed offer insights proteins, differentially expressed gastric ulcers stress, provide theoretical evidence radical cure gastric ulcers humans.
