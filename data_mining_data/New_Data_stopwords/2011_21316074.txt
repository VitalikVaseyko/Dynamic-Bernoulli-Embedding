 Hexavalent Chromium Cr(VI) important contaminant considered model oxidative toxicant released domestic industrial effluents, represents predominant chemical form metal aquatic ecosystems. hand, mammals reduced form Cr(III) considered essential microelement, involved regulation lipid carbohydrate metabolism; moreover, recent evidence suggests Cr may endocrine effects. work, effects Cr(VI) investigated digestive gland marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels exposed 0.1-1-10-100 mug Cr(VI) L(-1) animal(-1) 96 h. 100 mug L(-1), large increase total Cr tissue content observed; conditions, lysosomal membranes completely destabilized, whereas lysosomal biomarkers (neutral lipids-NL lipofuscin-LF), well different enzyme activities gene expression unaffected, indicating severe stress conditions tissue. hand, lower concentrations, changes histochemical, biochemical molecular endpoints observed. particular, 1 10 mug L(-1), lysosomal destabilization associated significant NL LF accumulation; however, changes catalase GSH transferase (GST) activities observed. concentrations, GSSG reductase (GSR) activity significantly increased, probably reflecting recycling GSSG produced GSH-mediated intracellular reduction Cr(VI). Increased activities key glycolytic enzymes PFK (phosphofructokinase) PK (pyruvate kinase) also observed, indicating Cr(VI) could affect carbohydrate metabolism. Cr(VI) induced downregulation effects expression metallothioneins MT10 MT20, except increase MT20 transcription males. Moreover, significant up-regulation Mytilus estrogen receptor MeER2 serotonin receptor (5-HTR) observed sexes. results demonstrate exposure Cr(VI) low ppb range result strong toxicity oxidative stress conditions mussel digestive gland. hand, data support hypothesis low concentrations metal exert pleiotropic effects mussel physiology, modulation lipid carbohydrate metabolism, effects expression estrogen-responsive genes.
