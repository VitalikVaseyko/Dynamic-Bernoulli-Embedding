 hard begin discuss tumor metabolism without mentioning Warburg effect. Tumor metabolism received intensive attention recent years understanding Warburg effect also known aerobic glycolysis. Even Warburg anticipate, nutrients, glutamine, serine glycine could serve alternative source energy demands block building cancer cells. delineate altered metabolic pathways cancer cells, isotopic tracing technique provides novel holistic insight metabolic switch control oncogenes tumor suppressor genes. array chromatography coupled mass spectrometry powerful tool detect isotope-labeled metabolites unlocking underlying biochemical reactions cancer cells. review article, focus carbon-13 deuterium-labeling quantitative analysis intermediate metabolites including reduced form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). NADPH mainly derived pentose phosphate pathway previous biochemical textbook. However, deuterium-isotope labeling metabolic flux analysis reveal important pathways NADPH production, one-carbon metabolism, also discussed review.
