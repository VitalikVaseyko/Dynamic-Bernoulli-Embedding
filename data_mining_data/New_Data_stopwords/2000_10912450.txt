 cellular molecular physiology pathology insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) mostly studied understood use animal models. Fundamental differences IDDM NIDDM animal models may help explain etiology behind diabetic cardiomyopathy, one severe complications IDDM. Experimental rat models IDDM exhibit characteristic increase tissue levels taurine heart, change seen NIDDM rats. article deals causes possible consequences observation may contribute development diabetic cardiomyopathy. Modulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) (PDH; EC 1.2.4.1) activity found possible mode taurine involvement. PDH mitochondrial protein rate-limiting step generation acetyl CoA glycolysis. IDDM, PDH activity decreased mechanism includes stimulation de novo synthesis kinase activator protein (KAP) phosphorylates PDH inactivates enzyme. lesion occur NIDDM rat hearts. Taurine known inhibit phosphorylation PDH vitro, taurine-depleted rats PDH phosphorylation known increase. Thus, increased levels taurine diabetic heart may inhibiting phosphorylation turn may stimulating synthesis KAP negative feedback process. main argument theory would lack change taurine levels activity PDH NIDDM rat model.
