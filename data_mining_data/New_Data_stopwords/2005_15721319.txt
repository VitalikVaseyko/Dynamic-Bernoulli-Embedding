 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) functions important junction intermediary metabolism influencing utilization fat versus carbohydrate source fuel. Activation PDC achieved phosphatases, whereas, inactivation catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs). expression PDK4 highly regulated glucocorticoid peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. demonstrate farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4), regulates variety genes involved lipoprotein metabolism, also regulates expression PDK4. Treatment rat hepatoma cells well human primary hepatocytes FXR agonists stimulates expression PDK4 levels comparable obtained glucocorticoids. addition, treatment mice FXR agonist significantly increased hepatic PDK4 expression, concomitantly decreasing plasma triglyceride levels. Thus, activation FXR may suppress glycolysis enhance oxidation fatty acids via inactivation PDC increasing PDK4 expression.
