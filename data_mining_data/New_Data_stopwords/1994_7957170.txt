 inhibition glycolysis ethanol oxidation examined isolated hepatocytes fasted rats. Glycolytic flux measured determining rate release tritium [6-3H]glucose. ethanol oxidation, rate glycolysis inhibited 80% freshly prepared hepatocytes, shuttle intermediates depleted, depressed 20% presence asparagine, condition activity malate/aspartate shuttle restored normal levels. inhibition glycolysis also partially released addition pyruvate alcohol dehydrogenase activity depressed 4-methylpyrazole. Titrations inhibitor revealed inverse linear relationships rates glycolysis ethanol oxidation. given rate ethanol oxidation, glycolytic flux lowest [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio highest presence aminooxyacetate, inhibitor malate/aspartate shuttle, whereas flux highest ratio lowest presence asparagine. titrations 4-methylpyrazole inhibition ethanol oxidation concomitant restoration glycolysis accompanied decline [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio, substantial fall rate reducing-equivalent transfer cytoplasm mitochondria increase lactate accumulation. findings imply reducing equivalents generated ethanol oxidation compete arising glycolysis transfer mitochondria. competition leads inhibition aerobic glycolysis, time contributes rise cytoplasmic NADH fall NAD+ results depression anaerobic glycolysis. Allosteric inhibition 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase due decrease concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate appear play primary role inhibition glycolysis ethanol. Ethanol oxidation effect glucose phosphorylation measured [2-3H]glucose, induced substantial increase cycling glucose glucose 6-phosphate.
