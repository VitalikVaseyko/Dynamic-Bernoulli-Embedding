 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays key role anaerobic mitochondrial metabolism parasitic nematode Ascaris suum. cDNA coding A. suum pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (APDK) cloned sequenced poly(A)+ RNA isolated adult A. suum muscle.2 APDK exhibited significant sequence identity mammalian PDKs. Nucleotide sequence analysis APDK cDNA revealed 22-nucleotide spliced leader, characteristic many nematode mRNAs, 5'-UTR 6 nucleotides, open reading frame 1197 nucleotides, 3'-UTR 101 nucleotides included putative polyadenylation signal. open reading frame predicted protein 399 amino acids molecular weight 45,402 included putative 18-aminoacid leader peptide. Recombinant APDK (rAPDK) functionally expressed Escherichia coli tag N-terminus purified apparent homogeneity Ni-NTA-agarose. Recombinant APDK dimer autophosphorylated activity stimulated presence APDK-deficient adult A. suum muscle PDC presumably binding APDK dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) core complex. binding core, rAPDK activity stimulated elevated NADH/NAD+ acetyl CoA/CoA ratios within ranges observed native APDK. Immunoblotting suggested native APDK focused series 43-kDa spots (pI 6.1-6.8) two-dimensional gels purified adult A. suum muscle PDC.
