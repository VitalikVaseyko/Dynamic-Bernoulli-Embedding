 Several aging phenotypes, including age-related memory impairment (AMI), thought caused cumulative oxidative damage. Drosophila, age-related impairments 1 hr memory suppressed reducing activity protein kinase (PKA). However, mechanism effect unclear. show decreasing PKA suppresses AMI reducing activity pyruvate carboxylase (PC), glial metabolic enzyme whose amounts increase upon aging. Increased PC activity causes AMI mechanism independent oxidative damage. Instead, increased PC activity associated decreases D-serine, glia-derived neuromodulator regulates NMDA receptor activity. D-serine feeding suppresses AMI memory impairment caused glial overexpression dPC, indicating oxidative stress-independent dysregulation glial modulation neuronal activity contributes AMI Drosophila.
