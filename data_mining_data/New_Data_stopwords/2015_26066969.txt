 BACKGROUND: Lactate import export cell membranes facilitated monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) 1 4. Expression profiles markers oxidative glycolytic phenotype. Descriptive studies functional studies neoplastic cells fibroblasts prostate cancer (PC) suggested distinct phenotype. aimed explore expression MCT1 MCT4 PC cells surrounding stroma large cohort. Additionally, wanted find distinct expression profiles associated biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS). METHODS: Tissue microarrays constructed 535 patients radical prostatectomies January 1, 1995, December 31, 2005. Immunohistochemistry used detect expression, degrees expression evaluated semiquantitatively 2 pathologists using light microscopy. RESULTS: MCT1, epithelial expression, whereas low level expression MCT4 tumor stroma. total 172 patients low expression MCT1 tumor MCT4 stroma. 232 patients high expression MCT1 low expression MCT4 stroma. 11 patients low tumoral MCT1 expression high stromal MCT4 expression, 26 patients (5%) high expression both. Patients high-high combination significantly reduced BFFS (P = 0.011), adjusting factors, effect significant independent (HR = 1.99, CI 95%: 1.09-3.62; P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: study adds current understanding reversed Warburg effect significant phenotype PC. High coexpression MCT1 tumor MCT4 stroma independently associated worse BFFS, strength association strong Gleason score >/=9.
