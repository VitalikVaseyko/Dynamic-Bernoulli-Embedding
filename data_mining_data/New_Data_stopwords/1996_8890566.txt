 Recent progress molecular analysis red cell enzymopathies showed 160 mutations 10 distinct genes essential red cell metabolisms. addition, since three-dimensional structure several enzymes including pyruvate kinase (PK) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) elucidated X-ray crystallographic studies, effect amino acid substitutions enzyme activity became predictable extent. contrary, mechanism hemolysis remains still unclear. clarify pathophysiology red cell enzymopathies, establishment animal model long awaited. Recently discovered novel mice model PK deficiency. mutant mice splenomegaly nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia inbred colony CBA strain enzymatically diagnosed PK deficiency. homozygous missense mutation identified red cell (R)-type PKcDNA sequence mutant, caused single amino acid substitution near substrate binding site PK. erythroid-progenitor cell number increased spleen mutant mice level approximately 66 times higher normal CBA mice, suggesting compensatory extramedullary erythropoiesis spleen mutant mice might partly compensate anemia. mutant mice useful experimental model understanding pathophysiology disorder.
