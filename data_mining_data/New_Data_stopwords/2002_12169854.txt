 aim work study effect administration cod liver oil non-oxidative oxidative fate glucose metabolism skeletal muscle normal rats. achieve goal, gastrocnemius examined regarding glucose oxidation, glycogen synthase activity glycogen storage baseline euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamping. results show dietary fish oil decreases plasma insulin levels without alteration glucose homeostasis (at baseline). addition, observed enhancement whole body glucose utilization clamping suggests increased peripheral insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, enhancement glycolytic pathway (increased levels muscle glucose-6-phosphate plasma lactate) rather changes oxidation (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) storage components glucose metabolism observed skeletal muscle rats fed dietary fish oil. results coupled hypolipidemic effects fish oil may implications prevention and/or management pathological states manifested insulin resistance without dyslipidemia.
