 Starvation extensively studied condition induces autophagy. Previous studies demonstrated starvation-induced autophagy regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide (O(2)(.-)) source ROS starvation conditions downstream signaling pathways regulating autophagy unclear. study, cervical cancer HeLa cell line generated deficient mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) (HeLa rho degrees cells). resulted endogenous levels O(2)(.-) significantly reduced failed induced starvation glucose, L-glutamine, pyruvate, serum (GP) amino acids serum (AA) compared wild type (wt) HeLa cells. contrast, H(2)O(2) production failed increase GP starvation wild type rho degrees cells whereas increased wt cells rho degrees cells AA starvation. GP AA starvation induced autophagy blocked rho degrees cells determined amount autophagosomes autolysosomes. Autophagy regulated 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation AMPK activated starvation conditions. demonstrate rho degrees cells HeLa cells expressing manganese-superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) cells fail activate AMPK activation following starvation. indicates mitochondrial ROS might regulate AMPK activation. addition, inhibiting AMPK activation either siRNA compound C resulted reduced autophagy starvation. Using ROS scavenger NAC, AMPK activation reduced starvation condition mTOR signaling increased. Taken together, mitochondria-generated ROS induces autophagy mediated AMPK pathway starvation conditions.
