 Empirical evidence indicates impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism defining characteristic almost cases Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence reviewed supporting general hypothesis up-regulation OxPhos activity, metabolic response mitochondrial dysregulation, drives cascade events leading AD. mode metabolic alteration, called Inverse Warburg effect, postulated essential compensatory mechanism energy production maintain viability impaired neuronal cells. article appeals inverse comorbidity cancer AD show amyloid hypothesis, genetic neuron-centric model origin sporadic forms AD, consistent epidemiological data concerning age-incidence rates AD. view Alzheimer's metabolic disease-a condition consistent mitochondrial dysregulation Inverse Warburg effect, entail radically new approach diagnostic therapeutic strategies.
