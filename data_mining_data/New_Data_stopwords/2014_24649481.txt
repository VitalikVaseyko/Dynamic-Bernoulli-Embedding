 AIMS: Accurate assessment inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity cornerstone effective therapy. Fecal M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) fecal calprotectin (FC) noninvasive markers mucosal inflammation IBD. aim study compare performance M2-PK FC assessment pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) Crohn's disease (CD) severity activity. MATERIALS METHODS: 121 patients IBD, including 75 UC 46 CD recruited. Control group consisted 35 healthy children (HS). Patients assigned groups depending disease severity activity. M2-PK calprotectin concentration determined stool samples using ELISA. Areas receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) FC M2-PK cut-off level M2-PK specificity matching FC specificity calculated compared. RESULTS: Performance M2-PK identifying patients IBD, UC CD among HS inferior FC. differences AUC respectively: -0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.13-(-0.06)], p<0.0001), -0.14 (95% CI [-0.19-(-0.09)], p<0.0001) -0.03 (95% CI [-0.05-(-0.001)], p<0.02). M2-PK inferior FC discriminating patients mild UC HS (AUC difference -0.23, 95% CI [-0.31-(-0.15)], p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: FC reflects pediatric IBD severity activity better M2-PK. difference particularly pronounced identifying patients mild UC UC remission.
