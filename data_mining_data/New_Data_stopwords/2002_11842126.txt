 Hibernation mammals requires metabolic shift away oxidation carbohydrates toward combustion stored fatty acids primary source energy torpor. key element involved fuel selection pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4). PDK4 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase thus minimizes carbohydrate oxidation preventing flow glycolytic products tricarboxylic acid cycle. paper examines expression PDK4 gene hibernation heart, skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue (WAT) 13-lined ground squirrel, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus. hibernation PDK4 mRNA levels increase 5-fold skeletal muscle 15-fold WAT compared summer-active levels. Similarly, PDK4 protein increased threefold heart, fivefold skeletal muscle, eightfold WAT. High levels serum insulin, likely inhibitory effect PDK4 gene expression, seen fall PDK4 mRNA levels low. Coordinate upregulation PDK4 three distinct tissues suggests common signal regulates PDK4 expression fuel selection hibernation.
