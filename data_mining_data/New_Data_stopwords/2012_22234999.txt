 analyze copper-induced cross talk among calcium, nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) calcium-dependent activation gene expression, marine alga Ulva compressa treated inhibitors calcium channels, ned-19, ryanodine, xestospongin C, chloroplasts mitochondrial electron transport chains, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea antimycin A, pyruvate dehydrogenase, moniliformin, calmodulins, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphtalene sulfonamide, calcium-dependent protein kinases, staurosporine, well scavengers NO, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, H(2)O(2), ascorbate, exposed sublethal concentration copper (10 mum) 24 h. level increased 2 12 h. first peak inhibited ned-19 3-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea second peak ned-19 antimycin A, indicating synthesis dependent calcium release occurs organelles. level H(2)O(2) increased 2, 3, 12 h inhibited ned-19, ryanodine, xestospongin C, moniliformin, indicating H(2)O(2) accumulation dependent calcium release Krebs cycle activity. addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoxglutarate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase activities Krebs cycle increased 2, 3, 12, and/or 14 h, increases inhibited vitro EGTA, calcium chelating agent. Calcium release 2, 3, 12 h inhibited 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide ascorbate, indicating activation H(2)O(2). addition, level antioxidant protein gene transcripts decreased N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphtalene sulfonamide staurosporine. Thus, copper-induced cross talk among calcium, H(2)O(2), calcium-dependent activation gene expression involving calmodulins calcium-dependent protein kinases.
