 investigated specific role CGI-58 regulation energy metabolism skeletal muscle. first examined CGI-58 protein expression various muscle types mice, next modulated CGI-58 expression overexpression knockdown studies human primary myotubes evaluated consequences oxidative metabolism. observed preferential expression CGI-58 oxidative muscles mice consistent triacylglycerol hydrolase activity. next showed pulse-chase CGI-58 overexpression increased 2-fold rate triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolysis, well TAG-derived fatty acid (FA) release oxidation. Oppositely, CGI-58 silencing reduced TAG hydrolysis TAG-derived FA release oxidation (-77%, P < 0.001), whereas increased glucose oxidation glycogen synthesis. Interestingly, modulations CGI-58 expression FA release reflected changes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene expression. regulation involves activation peroxisome proliferator activating receptor-delta (PPARdelta) lipolysis products. Altogether, data reveal CGI-58 plays limiting role control oxidative metabolism modulating FA availability expression PPARdelta-target genes, highlight important metabolic function CGI-58 skeletal muscle.
