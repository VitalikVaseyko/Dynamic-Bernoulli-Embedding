 Forkhead Box J1 (FOXJ1) belongs Fox gene family, plays complex crucial roles processes development, organogenesis, regulation immune system, well progression several malignancies. However, FOXJ1 functions bladder cancer remains unclear. Here, report FOXJ1 upregulated bladder cancer patients, predicts poor clinical outcomes. FOXJ1 facilitates bladder cancer cell proliferation colony formation. FOXJ1 knockdown suppresses bladder tumor growth nude mice. Mechanistically, FOXJ1 enhances glycolysis increasing glucose uptake, lactate production extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), decreasing ATP generation oxygen consumption rate (OCR) bladder cancer cells. findings provide clues regarding role FOXJ1 tumor inducer bladder cancer enhancer glycolysis. Targeting FOXJ1 could potential therapeutic strategy bladder cancer.
