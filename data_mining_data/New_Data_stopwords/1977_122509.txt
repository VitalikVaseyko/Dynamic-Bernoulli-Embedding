 absence exogenous energy source, galactose-grown cells Streptococcus lactis ML3 rapidly accumulated thiomethyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (TMG) 2-deoxyglucose intracellular concentrations 40 50 mM. Starved cells maintained capacity TMG uptake many hours, accumulation beta-galactoside insensitive proton-conducting ionophores (tetrachlorosalicylanilide carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) sulfydryl group reagents including iodoacetate N-ethylmaleimide. Fluorimetric analysis glycolytic intermediates extracts prepared starved cells revealed (a) high intracellular levels phosphoenolpyruvate (13 mM; PEP) 2-phosphoglycerate (approximately 39 mM; 2-PG), absence metabolites including glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, triosephosphates. following criteria showed PEP (and 2-PG) endogenous energy source TMG accumulation phosphotransferase system: intracellular concentrations PEP 2-PG decreased concomitant uptake TMG, close correlation observed maximum accumulation beta-galactoside total available concentration two intermediates; TMG accumulated anionic derivative, extraction incubation alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) formed original analogue; fluoride inhibition 2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolyase (EC 4.2.1.11) prevented conversion 2-PG PEP, uptake TMG starved cells reduced 80%; stoichiometric ratio [TMG] accumulated/[PEP] consumed almost unity (0.93). cells metabolizing glucose, intermediates listed (a) (b) found. Upon exhaustion glucose medium, metabolites (b) longer detectable, intracellular concentrations PEP 2-PG increased levels previously observed starved cells. glycolytic intermediates (b) vitro heterotropic effectors pyruvate kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) S. lactis ML3. suggested capacity starved cells maintain high intracellular concentrations PEP 2-PG consequence decreased vivo activity key regulatory enzyme glycolysis.
