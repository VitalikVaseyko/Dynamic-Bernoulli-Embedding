 Beyond role recycling intracellular components nonselectively sustain survival response metabolic stresses, autophagy also selectively degrade specific cargoes damaged dysfunctional organelles maintain cellular homeostasis. Mitochondria, known power plant cells, critical dynamic organelles playing fundamental role cellular metabolism. Mitophagy, selective autophagic elimination mitochondria, identified yeast mammalian cells. Moreover, defects mitophagy may contribute variety human disorders neurodegeneration myopathies. However, role mitophagy development cancer remains largely unclear. review, summarize current knowledge regulation function mitophagy development cancer.
