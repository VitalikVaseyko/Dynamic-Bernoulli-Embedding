 Sequential changes expression two glucose transporter isoforms (GLUT1, GLUT2), activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase malic enzyme development rat renal basophilic cell tumors studied using histochemical techniques. Early basophilic cell tubules similar proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) overall histochemical pattern, particularly expression glucose transporters, suggesting basophilic cell tubules tumors derived arise PCT. comparison PCT, basophilic cell tubules show slightly increased activities enzymes studied. basophilic cell tumors, markedly elevated hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities accompanied considerable reduction expression GLUT2. GLUT1 expression found basophilic cell tubules PCT. Small basophilic cell tumors also express GLUT1, GLUT1 regularly expressed several cell layers surrounding necrotic areas within large basophilic cell tumors. results indicate increased glycolytic activity reduced GLUT2 expression take place development renal basophilic cell tumors.
