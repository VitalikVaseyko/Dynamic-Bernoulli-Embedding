 endogenous synthesis cholesterol hepatocyte nodules, induced male Wistar rats, single dose hepatocarcinogen diethylnitrosamine followed selection procedure, investigated compared surrounding control tissue. addition, activity enzymes related carbohydrate metabolism (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase pyruvate kinase), measured. Hepatocyte nodules showed striking increase capacity synthesizing cholesterol, comparison surrounding control tissues, enhancement activity pentose phosphate pathway, indicated increased activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, concomitant decrease glucose-6-phosphatase. stimulation cholesterol synthesis pentose phosphate pathway associated increased incorporation labelled thymidine DNA. data indicate that, among metabolic disturbances, enhancement cholesterol synthesis pentose phosphate pathway, accompanied increased proliferative capacity hepatocyte nodules.
