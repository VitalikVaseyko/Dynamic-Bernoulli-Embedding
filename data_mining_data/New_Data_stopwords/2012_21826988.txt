 OBJECTIVE: investigate enhancement effect combination shRNA interfering plasmid targeting PKM2 recombinant Endostatin treatment lung cancer. METHODS: Twenty five BABL/nu/nu mice bearing A549 lung cancer divided 5 groups (NS control, psh-Control, psh-PKM2 treated group, Endostar treated group, psh-PKM2+Endostar treated group) treated shRNA interfering plasmid targeting PKM2 recombinant Endostatin respectively combination. expression PKM2 A549 detected immunofluorescent assay. interference effect psh-PKM2 determined Western blot. tumor volume, microvessel density (MVD), apoptosis index (AI) side effects observed. RESULTS: combination treatment RNA interfering plasmid targeting PKM2 recombinant Endostatin inhibited tumor growth obviously (P < 0.05); combination group revealed decreased MVD increased AI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: combination shRNA interfering plasmid targeting PKM2 recombinant Endostatin might enhance anti-tumor effect increasing apoptosis cancer cell.
