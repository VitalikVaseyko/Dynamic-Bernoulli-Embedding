 Cancer cells display high rates aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Lactate pyruvate, end products glycolysis, overproduced cancer cells even presence oxygen. pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) allows glucose conversion ribose nucleic acid synthesis, glucose degradation lactate, regeneration redox equivalents. nonoxidative part PPP controlled transketolase (TKT) enzymes. One TKT isoform, transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) specifically upregulated different human cancers overexpression predicts poor patient's survival. finding implicates increased TKTL1 expression may activate PPP leading enhanced cancer cell growth survival. analyze functional role TKTL1 malignant progression, inhibited TKTL1 RNAi technologies human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. TKTL1 suppression resulted significantly slowed cell growth, glucose consumption lactate production. TKTL1 knockdown-cells, intracellular reactive oxygen species levels significantly increased, whereas sensitivity towards oxidative stress-induced apoptosis clearly enhanced. data provide new clues importance TKTL1 dys-regulation tumor cells indicate TKTL1 overexpression may considered new tumor marker also good target anticancer therapy.
