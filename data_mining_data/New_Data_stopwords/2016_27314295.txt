 Cancer cells usually utilize glucose carbon source aerobic glycolysis, named ``Warburg effect''. Recent studies shown MicroRNAs (miRNAs), class short non-coding RNAs, play role regulation metabolic reprograming cancer cells. present study, report miR-181b negatively regulates glycolysis gastric cancer cells. Over-expression miR-181b mimics reduces glucose uptake lactate production, increasing cellular ATP levels NCI-N87 MGC80-3 cells. molecular level, miR-181b directly inhibits expression level hexokinase 2 (HK2), key enzyme catalyzes first step glycolysis, targeting 3'-untranslated region. addition, miR-181b represses cell proliferation migration dramatically down-regulated human gastric cancers. Therefore, data disclose novel function miR-181b reprogramming metabolic process gastric cancer.
