 1. Incubation isolated hepatocytes fructose concentrations 3 mM resulted apparent inhibition pyruvate kinase assayed crude extracts sub-optimal phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations. 2. Fructose concentrations 3 mM caused activation enzyme. 3. Increases hepatocyte contents positive effectors fructose 1.6-bisphosphate fructose 1-phosphate found concentrations fructose 10mM. 4. Removal extrahepatocyte medium hepatocytes washing resulted activation enzyme concentrations fructose examined. 5. Inhibitors enzyme shown accumulate hepatocytes despite depletion ATP (a known negative effector) caused higher concentrations fructose. Indeed inhibition pyruvate kinase appeared correlated depletion ATP. 6. Alanine (a known inhibitor) shown accumulate hepatocytes consequence incubation fructose. 7. Allantoin uric acid shown inhibitors partially purified pyruvate kinase preparation assayed presence absence fructose 1.6-bisphosphate. 8. Allantoin, uric acid, accumulated extrahepatocyte medium result incubation cells 10 mM-fructose.
