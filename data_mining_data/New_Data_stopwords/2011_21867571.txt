 Cancer cells show broad spectrum bioenergetic states, cells using aerobic glycolysis others rely oxidative phosphorylation main source energy. addition, mounting evidence metabolic coupling occurs aggressive tumors, epithelial cancer cells stromal compartment, well-oxygenated hypoxic compartments. recently showed oxidative stress tumor stroma, due aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial dysfunction, important cancer cell mutagenesis tumor progression. specifically , increased autophagy/mitophagy tumor stroma drives form parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling. findings explain effective treat tumors either inducers inhibitors autophagy, would disrupt energetic coupling. also discuss evidence glutamine addiction cancer cells produces ammonia via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Ammonia production cancer cells, turn, could help maintain autophagy tumor stromal compartment. vicious cycle, initial glutamine provided cancer cells would produced autophagy tumor stroma. Thus, believe parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling important implications cancer diagnosis therapy, example, designing novel metabolic imaging techniques establishing new targeted therapies. direct support notion, identified loss stromal caveolin-1 marker oxidative stress, hypoxia, autophagy tumor microenvironment, explaining powerful predictive value. Loss stromal caveolin-1 breast cancers associated early tumor recurrence, metastasis, drug resistance, leading poor clinical outcome.
