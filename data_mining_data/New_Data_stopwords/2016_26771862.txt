 Transducing light energy changes material properties central large range functional materials, including used light harvesting. conventional semiconductors, photoconductivity arises due generation mobile electrons holes light. demonstrate, knowledge first time, analogue effect protons organic polymer solution water. show material doped photoacids, light excitation generates extra mobile protons change low-frequency conductivity material. measure change poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) water sandwiched two transparent electrodes doped well-known photoacid 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS). complex impedance material measured range 0.1 Hz-1 MHz presence absence light, found shining light changes low frequency impedance significantly. model impedance spectra material minimal circuit composed diffusive impedance (Warburg element), parallel capacitance, resistance. Fitting light dark impedance spectra model reveals light reduces low-frequency diffusive impedance material, consistent generation extra free carriers light. suggest light-induced conductivity change arises mainly due photoreleased protons manage escape zone influence parent ion avoid recapture. escape likely materials larger diffusion coefficient protons shorter electrostatic screening lengths parent ion. explanation consistent observed differences photoconductivity solution HPTS water PEG. anticipate scheme employed protonic circuits direct transduction energy light protonic gradients protonic currents necessary. work also serve basis using photoacids optical handles characterizing molecular mechanisms conductivity proton conducting materials.
