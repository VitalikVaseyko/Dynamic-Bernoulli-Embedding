 effects acute bout prolonged exhaustive exercise activities hepatic lipogenic enzymes investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats randomly divided three groups: fasted 48 h without refeeding (FA) fasted 48 h refed diet high fructose (RF) cornstarch (RC). One-half group rats exercised treadmill 20 m/min, 5% grade, exhaustion half rested amount time without food. Dietary intakes refeeding kept equal exercised rested control animals. Activities hepatic lipogenic enzymes measured, i.e., fatty acid synthase (FAS), L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, induced dramatically fasting-refeeding significantly higher RF RC rats (P < 0.05). FAS activity increased 19- 39-fold, respectively, RC RF rats compared FA rats. Exercise decreased FAS activity approximately one-third resting control value RC RF rats (P < 0.05) FA rats. L-PK activity elevated 55% RC 100% RF rats compared FA rats (P < 0.05). FA RF rats also showed reduction L-PK activity exercise. significant alteration lipogenic enzymes observed exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
