 Pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle cocrystallized complex MgIIATP, oxalate, Mg2+, either K+ Na+. Crystals either Na+ K+ belong space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), asymmetric units contain two tetramers. structures solved molecular replacement refined 2.1 (K+) 2.35 (Na+) resolution. structures Na+ K+ complexes virtually isomorphous. eight subunits within asymmetric unit contains MgIIoxalate bidentate complex linked protein coordination Mg2+ carboxylates Glu 271 Asp 295. Six subunits also contain alpha,beta,gamma-tridentate complex MgIIATP, active-site cleft, located domains B, closed subunits. remaining two subunits MgIIATP missing, active-site cleft open. Closure active-site cleft fully liganded subunits includes rotation 41 degrees B domain relative domain. alpha-Carbons residues B domain undergo movements 17.8 (Lys 124) cleft closure. Lys 206, Arg 119, Asp 177 B domain move several angstroms positions open conformation contact MgIIATP complex active site. gamma-phosphate ATP coordinates magnesium ions monovalent cation, K+ Na+. Mg2+-coordinated oxygen MgIIoxalate complex lies 3.0 Pgamma ATP, oxygen positioned in-line attack phosphorus. side chains Lys 269 Arg 119 positioned provide leaving-group activation forward reverse directions. obvious candidate acid/base catalyst near 2-si face prospective enolate normal substrate. functional group linked solvent side-chain hydroxyls may function proton relay.
