 Bladder cancer one difficult malignancies control. explored use novel RNA-interference method driver oncogene regulating cancer specific energy metabolism combination treatment small interfering RNA (siRNA) microRNA. transfection T24 253JB-V cells miR-145 and/or siR-PTBP1, examined effects cell growth gene expression performing trypan blue dye exclusion test, Western blot, Hoechst 33342 staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), electron microscopy. anti-cancer effects xenograft model mice miR-145 and/or siR-PTBP1 assessed. combination treatment induced deeper longer growth inhibition reduced levels mRNA protein expression c-Myc polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) single treatment. Notably, combination treatment impaired cancer specific energy metabolism inhibiting c-Myc/PTBP1/PKMs axis also inactivated MAPK/ERK PI3K/AKT pathways examined vitro vivo. Furthermore, combination treatment induced apoptosis autophagy; but, cells, apoptotic cell death accompanied autophagy, condensation chromatin many autophagosomes coexistent. combination treatment could novel RNA-interference strategy systemic silencing Warburg effect-promoting driver oncogene PTBP1 bladder cancer cells.
