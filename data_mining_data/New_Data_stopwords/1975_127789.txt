 rates ATPase [EC 3.6.1.3] reaction H-meromyosin-F-actin-relaxing protein system measured 2 mM MgCl2, 50mM KC1, 10mM Tris-HC1 pH 7.8 20 degrees presence absence 0.05-0.1 mM Ca2+ ions. concentrations H-meromyosin (HMM) F-actin-relaxing protein (F-A-PR) complex 3.4 3 mg/ml, respectively, ATPase reaction coupled 4 mg/ml pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40] 1 20 mM phosphoenolpyruvate regenerate ATP. amount ADP bound HMM ATPase reaction determined measuring amount ADP remaining reaction mixture. amount ATP bound HMM determined subtracting amount bound ADP total amount nucleotides bound HMM, measured rapid flow-dialysis method. following results obtained. 1. ATPase activity HMM-F-A-RP system increased linearly increase amount ATP added, independent presence 0.05 mM Ca2+, amount ATP added less 1 mole/mole HMM. presence 0.05 mM Ca2+, ATPase activity reached maximal level 1.2-1.5 mole ATP added per mole HMM, maintained level even 3 moles added ATP/mole HMM. presence 3mM EGTA, ATPase activity decreased increase amount ATP added, 1.5 3 moles ATP/mole HMM, reached level HMM ATPase reaction 3 moles added ATP/mole HMM. Similar results observed concentration HMM maintained 3.4 mg/ml concentration F-A-RP complex decreased 3 1 0.5 mg/ml.
