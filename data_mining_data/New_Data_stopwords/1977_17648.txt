 properties pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEP CK), two enzymes determine preferrential accumulation either succinate lactate endproducts carbohydrate metabolism, described adult Hymenolepis diminuta. PK activity Vmax Km levels PEP unaffected ATP, alanine, FDP4, H+ ions, inhibited 50% 6.3 mM L-lactate 30 mM HCO3. addition 30 mM HCO3 increased Km(PEP) 6-fold alter Vmax. inhibition PK HCO3 cannot explained entirely effect ionic strength, probably represents specific modulator-enzyme interaction. similar conditions PEP CK maximally activated. Although L-lactate inhibited PEP CK (Ki(lac) = 1.8 mM), effector may play minor role regulation PEP flux. results implicate poise HCO3-:CO2 system major determiner endproduct accumulation H. diminuta.
