 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC), heterogeneous disease common men women, continues one predominant cancers worldwide. Lifestyle, diet, environmental factors gene defects contribute towards CRC development risk. Therefore, identification novel biomarkers aid management CRC crucial. aim present study identify candidate biomarkers CRC, develop better understanding role tumourogenesis. METHODS: study, plasma tissue samples patients diagnosed CRC, together non-malignant normal controls examined using mass spectrometry based proteomics metabolomics approaches. RESULTS: established level several biomolecules, including serotonin, gamma enolase, pyruvate kinase members 14-3-3 family proteins, showed statistically significant changes comparing malignant versus non-malignant patient samples, distinct pattern emerging mirroring cancer cell energy production. CONCLUSION: diagnosis management CRC could enhanced discovery validation new candidate biomarkers, found study, aimed facilitating early detection and/or patient stratification together providing information complex behaviour cancer cells.
