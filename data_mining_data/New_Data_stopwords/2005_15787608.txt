 pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex catalyses oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate, important regulatory step oxidative metabolism. Phosphorylation E1 (pyruvate decarboxylase) subunit one three specific serine residues results loss enzyme activity. Four dedicated PDHK (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) isoenzymes identified, display distinct tissue-specific expression profile, differential regulatory properties. Thus PDHK play key role controlling balance glucose lipid oxidation according substrate supply. Increasing glucose oxidation inhibiting PDHK may effective mechanism increase glucose utilization; additionally, increasing pyruvate oxidation may contribute lowering glucose level decreasing supply gluconeogenic substrates. number PDHK inhibitors available enable mechanism evaluated therapy diabetes. isoenzyme selectivity profile AZD7545 related compounds described evidence non-ATP-competitive mode action presented. compounds increase PDH activity vivo, dosed chronically, improve glycaemic control Zucker rats. Furthermore, glucose lowering demonstrated hyperglycaemic Zucker diabetic fatty rat. result supports hypothesis inhibition PDHK may effective therapy Type II diabetes.
