 Tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) essential Warburg effect. addition well-established role aerobic glycolysis, PKM2 directly regulates gene transcription. However, mechanism underlying nonmetabolic function PKM2 remains elusive. show PKM2 directly binds histone H3 phosphorylates histone H3 T11 upon EGF receptor activation. phosphorylation required dissociation HDAC3 CCND1 MYC promoter regions subsequent acetylation histone H3 K9. PKM2-dependent histone H3 modifications instrumental EGF-induced expression cyclin D1 c-Myc, tumor cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, brain tumorigenesis. addition, levels histone H3 T11 phosphorylation correlate nuclear PKM2 expression levels, glioma malignancy grades, prognosis. findings highlight role PKM2 protein kinase nonmetabolic functions histone modification, essential epigenetic regulation gene expression tumorigenesis.
