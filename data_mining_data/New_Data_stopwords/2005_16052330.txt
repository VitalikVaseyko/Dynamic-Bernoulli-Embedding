 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Glucose peptide growth factors insulin, IGF-I IGF-II strongly regulate beta cell mass. Furthermore, beta cell expression IGF-I receptor (Igf1r) insulin receptor (Insr) mandatory several steps insulin secretion. MATERIALS METHODS: hypothesised glucose concentration might regulate expression Igf1r, Insr insulin receptor-related receptor (Insrr) islets beta cells. Moreover, since ratio ATP:ADP important intracellular mechanism involved insulin secretion, since depletion ATP leads AMP accumulation, evaluated role AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) glucose-dependent receptor regulation. RESULTS: rat islets, high glucose exposure (25 mmol/l) increased gene expression Igf1r, Insr Insrr also metabolic glycolysis gene liver-type pyruvate kinase (Pklr) compared intermediate (6.2 mmol/l) low glucose concentration (1.6 mmol/l) 24 h. rat INS-1E beta cells, Pklr expression suppressed low glucose islets, Insr Insrr suppressed high increased low glucose levels. Igf1r expression suppressed high- low- glucose concentration. Activation AMPK 5-amino-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR, 0.5 mmol/l) suppressed Pklr expression, strongly stimulated gene expression Igf1r, Insr Insrr. Protein expression IR IGF-IR reflected glucose AICAR-regulated mRNA expression receptors INS-1E cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: conclude glucose directly interacts islet beta cell expression growth factor receptors mandatory beta cell growth insulin secretion. Stimulation Igf1r Insr gene expression AMPK-activator AICAR might indicate involvement AMPK regulation Igf1r, Insr Insrr expression beta cells.
