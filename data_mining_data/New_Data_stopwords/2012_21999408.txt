 Least-squares fitting Hill equation quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) assays results frequent unsatisfactory fits. learn exploit prior knowledge improve Hill fitting nonlinear regression method called domain knowledge fitter (DK-fitter). paper formulates solves DK-fitter 44 public qHTS data sets. new Hill parameter estimation technique validated using three unbiased approaches, including novel method involves generating simulated samples. paper fosters extraction higher quality information screens improved potency evaluation.
