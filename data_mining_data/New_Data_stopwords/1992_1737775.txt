 One basic features allosteric regulation involves long range transduction information. Based crystallographic data protein systems regulated allosteric mechanisms, global conformational change always observed. is, therefore, important useful correlate cooperativity global structural change mode binding regulatory ligand. Two systems chosen study, namely Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein muscle pyruvate kinase, show negative positive cooperativity binding allosteric ligands, respectively. Quantitative titration global structural change, monitored high precision analytical gel chromatography technique, conducted function allosteric effector concentration. results obtained cAMP receptor protein show protein undergoes contraction upon binding cAMP. decreases Stokes radius associated complex formation 0.1 +/- 0.1 0.7 +/- 0.1 one two cAMP-binding sites filled, respectively. results pyruvate kinase system show concerted structural change quantitatively match predicted behavior based equilibrium constants derived analysis steady state kinetic data two-state model. Hence, two systems, results show negative positive cooperativity correlated sequential concerted modes structural change, respectively.
