 Octanoic acid inhibits, vitro, bacterial enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, fumarase, lactate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme Arthrobacter crystallopoietes. free fatty acid appears act inhibitor lipogenesis, although affect rate gluconeogenesis. demonstrate inhibition may physiological significance vivo, enzymes involved lipogenesis, fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase, phosphoglucomutase, phosphohexoisomerase, aconitase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADP glutamate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, assayed found inhibited free fatty acid.
