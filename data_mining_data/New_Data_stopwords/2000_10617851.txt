 activities several enzymes levels metabolites measured digestive gland Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed increasing hypoxia 7 168 hr. sharp decrease pyruvate kinase observed 7 hr. anoxic enzyme showed increased Km phosphoenolpyruvate decreased apparent Ki alanine. Glyoxalase constant 72 hr exposure decreased. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase alanopine dehydrogenase decreased. metabolites alanine succinate increased hypoxia time, whereas D- L-lactic aspartic acids undetectable constant respectively. Mitochondrial formation pyruvate D-lactate demonstrated intact mitochondria isolated digestive gland Mytilus galloprovincialis. significance observed enzyme metabolite changes hypoxia discussed comparison invertebrate organisms. role mitochondria overall adaptive strategy Mytilus galloprovincialis discussed.
