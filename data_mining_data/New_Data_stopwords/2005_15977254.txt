 Fed-batch fermentations glucose P. acidipropionici ATCC 4875 free-cell suspension culture immobilized fibrous-bed bioreactor (FBB) studied. latter produced much higher propionic acid concentration (71.8 +/- 0.8 g/L vs. 52.2 +/- 1.1 g/L), indicating enhanced tolerance propionic acid inhibition cells adapted FBB. Compared free-cell fermentation, FBB culture produced 20-59% propionate (0.40-0.65 +/- 0.02 g/g vs. 0.41 +/- 0.02 g/g), 17% less acetate (0.10 +/- 0.01 g/g vs. 0.12 +/- 0.02 g/g), 50% less succinate (0.09 +/- 0.02 g/g vs. 0.18 +/- 0.03 g/g) glucose. higher propionate production FBB attributed mutations two key enzymes, oxaloacetate transcarboxylase propionyl CoA: succinyl CoA transferase, leading production propionic acid pyruvate. showed higher specific activity lower sensitivity propionic acid inhibition mutant wild type. contrast, activity PEP carboxylase, converts PEP directly oxaloacetate leads production succinate glucose, generally lower mutant wild type. phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase acetate formation pathway, however, significant difference mutant wild type. addition, mutant striking change morphology. threefold increase length approximately 24% decrease diameter, mutant cell approximately 10% higher specific surface area made mutant efficient transporting substrates metabolites across cell membrane. slightly lower membrane-bound ATPase activity found mutant also indicated mutant might efficient proton pump allow better tolerate propionic acid. addition, mutant longer-chain saturated fatty acids (C17:0) less unsaturated fatty acids (C18:1), could decrease membrane fluidity might contributed increased propionate tolerance. enhanced propionic acid production glucose P. acidipropionici thus attributed high viable cell density maintained reactor favorable mutations resulted adaptation cell immobilization FBB.
