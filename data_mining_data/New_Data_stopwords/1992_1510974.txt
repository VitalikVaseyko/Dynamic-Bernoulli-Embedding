 regulatory mechanism rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase studied function temperature conjunction phenylalanine, allosteric inhibitor. inhibitory effect phenylalanine modulated temperature. low temperatures, presence phenylalanine almost inconsequential, temperature increases phenylalanine-dependent inhibition kinetic activity. addition, presence phenylalanine induces cooperativity relation velocity substrate concentration. effect especially pronounced elevated temperature. kinetic data analyzed using equation describes steady-state kinetic velocity data function five equilibrium constants two rate constants. Van't Hoff analysis temperature dependence equilibrium constants determined nonlinear curve fitting revealed interaction pyruvate kinase substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, enthalpy-driven process. consistent interaction involves electrostatic forces, indeed, phosphoenolpyruvate negatively charged substrate. contrast, interaction pyruvate kinase phenylalanine strongly entropy driven. results imply binding phenylalanine involves hydrophobic interaction consistent basic concepts strengthening hydrophobic effect increase temperature. effect phenylalanine high temperatures net consequence weakening substrate-enzyme interaction significant strengthening inhibitor binding inactive state pyruvate kinase. effects salts also studies. results show salts also exert differential effect binding substrate inhibitor enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
