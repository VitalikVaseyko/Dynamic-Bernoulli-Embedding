 Newborn rabbits mainly brown multilocular fat tissue. activity G-6-PDH shows prenatal decrease. G-6-PDH activity clearly lower postnatal compared fetal period. due minor role fatty acid synthesis reduced fat storage time. high capacity glycolysis becomes apparent high activity hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase. activity enzymes, however, shows slight postnatal changes, HK LDH contrast pyruvate kinase postnatal period apparently regulatory effect. altogether high activity NADP specific isocitrate dehydrogenase indicates high turnover rates Krebs cycle suggests adjustment metabolism high energy turnover.
