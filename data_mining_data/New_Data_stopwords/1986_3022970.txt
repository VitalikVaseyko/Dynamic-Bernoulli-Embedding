 urinary excretion four enzymes (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glutathione S-transferase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase pyruvate kinase) assayed daily 59 patients following renal cadaveric allografting. 51 patients given cyclosporin (CyA group) immunosuppressive, 8 patients treated conventionally azathioprine prednisolone (CON-group). Urinary enzyme output evaluated two different mathematical models. Model follows single enzyme excretion, whereas model B also analyzes enzyme patterns. best results obtained combined analysis four enzymes model B. CON-group sensitivity 1.00, specificity 0.85, predictive values positive test 0.45 12 graft rejections diagnosed correctly. CyA group sensitivity 0.40, specificity 0.99, predictive value positive test 0.33, 6 9 rejections recognized. evaluation single enzymes produce similarly good results either model.
