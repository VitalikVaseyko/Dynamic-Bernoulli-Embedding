 Infective (L3) larvae Strongyloides ratti (homogonic strain) freeze-clamped (-196 degrees C) steady-state content glycolytic, Krebs tricarboxylic acid (KTA)-cycle intermediates adenine nucleotides analysed. Comparison mass-action ratios (MARs) glycolytic enzymes apparent equilibrium constants (K9eq) indicate phosphoglucomutase, glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglyceromutase phosphopyruvate hydratase reactions near equilibrium, whilst hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase displaced equilibrium. S. ratti aldolase myokinase appear somewhat displaced equilibrium thus may pseudoregulatory roles. adenylate energy charge (AEC), ATP/ADP ratio available adenylate energy (AAE) indices 0.9 +/- 0.04, 8.76 +/- 1.5 397 +/- 43, respectively. free [NAD+]/[NADH+H+] ratio cytoplasmic compartment S. ratti L3 larvae calculated employing steady-state content oxidised reduced substrates lactate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.27) combined glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.2.1.12)/3-phosphoglycerate kinase (E.C. 2.7.2.3) system ca. 523 1200, respectively. free[NAD+]/[NADH+H+] ratio mitochondrial compartment S. ratti L3 larvae calculated using malate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.37) equilibrium found 1962:1. data discussed respect predominantly aerobic nature energy metabolism L3 larvae.
