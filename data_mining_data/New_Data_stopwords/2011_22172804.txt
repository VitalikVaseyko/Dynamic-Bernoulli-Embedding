 Voltage dependent anion channels (VDAC) highly conserved proteins responsible permeability mitochondrial outer membrane hydrophilic metabolites like ATP, ADP respiratory substrates. Although previously assumed remain open, VDAC closure emerging important mechanism regulation global mitochondrial metabolism apoptotic cells also cells dying. hepatic ethanol oxidation acetaldehyde, VDAC closure suppresses exchange mitochondrial metabolites, resulting inhibition ureagenesis. vivo, VDAC closure ethanol occurs coordinately mitochondrial uncoupling. Since acetaldehyde passes membranes independently channels transporters, VDAC closure uncoupling together foster selective rapid oxidative metabolism toxic acetaldehyde nontoxic acetate mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. single reconstituted VDAC, tubulin decreases VDAC conductance, HepG2 hepatoma cells, free tubulin negatively modulates mitochondrial membrane potential, effect enhanced protein kinase A. Tubulin-dependent closure VDAC cancer cells contributes suppression mitochondrial metabolism may underlie Warburg phenomenon aerobic glycolysis. article part Special Issue entitled: VDAC structure, function, regulation mitochondrial metabolism.
