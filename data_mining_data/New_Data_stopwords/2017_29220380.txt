 cancer, glycolysis driving enzymes regulating microRNAs one key focus oncology research lately. glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) crucial Warburg effect human glioma, common malignant brain tumor. present study, studied tumorigenic role HK2 glioma, clarified mechanism miR-218 induced HK2 regulation glioma development. HK2 expression patient derived glioma non neoplastic brain tissue quantified. HK2 silenced U87 U251 cell lines assessed proliferation, migration invasive potential vitro, tumor forming potential U87 cells evaluated vivo. untreated cell lines served control. HK2 expression (a) lentivirus-infected, miR-218 overexpressing (b) shRNA mediated Bmi1 silenced U87 U251 glioma cell lines quantified. Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR analysis WB employed required. HK2 expression significantly increased glioma tissues comparing non neoplastic brain tissues positively correlated glioma grade. Silencing HK2 glioma cell lines significantly decreased proliferation, migration, invasion tumorigenic abilities. Although, overexpression miR-218 significantly downregulated HK2 expression, luciferase reporter assay failed show HK2 direct target miR-218. direct correlation, however, observed HK2 Bmi-1, direct target miR-218. Taken together, findings confirmed tumorigenic activity HK2 glioma, involvement miR218/Bmi1 pathway regulation expression.
