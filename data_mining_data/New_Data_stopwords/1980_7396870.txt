 1. Evidence given three sites phosphorylation alpha-chains decarboxylase component purified rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, analogous established procine bovine complexes. Inactivation rat heart complex correlated phosphorylation site 1. Relative initial rates phosphorylation site 1 greater site 2 greater site 3. 2. Methods described measurement incorporation 32Pi complex rat heart mitochondria oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate + L-malate (total, sites 1, 2 3). Inactivation complex related linearly phosphorylation site 1 mitochondria normal diabetic rats. relative initial rates phosphorylation site 1 greater site 2 greater site 3. Rates site-2 site-3 phosphorylation may closer site 1 mitochondria diabetic rats mitochondria normal rats. 3. concentration inactive (phosphorylated) complex varied mitochondria normal rats inhibiting kinase reaction pyruvate concentrations ranging 0.15 0.4 mM. results showed concentration inactive complex related linearly incorporation 32Pi site 1. Inhibition 32Pi incorporations pyruvate concentrations range site 3 greater site 2 greater site 1. 4. mitochondria diabetic rats, pyruvate (0.15-0.4 mM) inhibited incorporation 32Pi site 3, effect concentration inactive complex incorporations 32Pi site 1 site 2. concluded site-3 phosphorylation required inactivation complex rat heart mitochondria. 5. Evidence given phosphorylation sites 2 3 may inhibit reactivation complex dephosphorylation rat heart mitochondria.
