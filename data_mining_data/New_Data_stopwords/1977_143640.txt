 activity enzymes glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase) hexose monophosphate shunt (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) determined eye tissues rabbit different stages ontogenesis. activity enzymes retina shown higher eye tissues. uveal tract (iris, ciliary bodies, uvea) activity glycolytic enzymes changes age. greatest changes activity enzymes found period opening eyelids. activity enzymes hexose monophosphate shunt eye tissues increases age. relative activity dehydrogenases hexose monophosphate shunt establishment visual function is, however, high exceed phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase eye tissues rabbit.
