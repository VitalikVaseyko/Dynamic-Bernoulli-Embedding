 proteins encoded oncogene v-src cellular counterpart c-src (designated generically pp60src) tightly associated plasma membranes intracellular membranes. association due part amino-terminal myristylation pp60src, several lines evidence suggest amino-terminal portions protein also involved. report pp60src contains least three domains which, conjunction myristylation, capable mediating attachment membranes determining subcellular localization. identified domains fusing various portions pp60src pyruvate kinase, normally cytoplasmic protein. Amino acids 1 14 pp60src sufficient mediate myristylation attachment pyruvate kinase cytoplasmic granules. contrast, amino acids 38 111 mediate association plasma membrane perinuclear membranes, whereas amino acids 204 259 mediate association primarily perinuclear membranes. conclude pp60src contains independent domains target protein distinctive subcellular locations thus may facilitate diverse biological functions protein.
