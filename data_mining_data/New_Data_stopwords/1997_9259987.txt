 Extracts human liver found contain activities copurified coeluted two major subtypes mediators (type type P) isolated insulin-stimulated rat liver. putative type mediator human liver inhibited cAMP-dependent protein kinase bovine heart, decreased phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels rat hepatoma cells, stimulated lipogenesis rat adipocytes. putative type P mediator stimulated bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. fractions able stimulate proliferation EGFR T17 fibroblasts type able support growth organotypic cultures chicken embryo cochleovestibular ganglia. activities resistant Pronase treatment presence carbohydrates, phosphate, free-amino groups confirmed two fractions. properties consistent structure/ function characteristics type P inositolphosphoglycans (IPG) previously characterized rat liver. Further, ability human-derived mediators interact rat adipocytes bovine-derived metabolic enzymes suggests similarity structure mediators purified different species. Galactose oxidase-susceptible membrane-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI) proposed precursors IPG. GPI purified human liver membranes followed treatment galactose oxidase reduction NaB3H4. Serial t.l.c. revealed three radiolabeled bands comigrated putative GPI precursors found rat liver. galactose-oxidase-reactive lipidic compounds, however, partially susceptible hydrolysis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C Bacillus thuringiensis resistant glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C Trypanosoma brucei. data indicate IPG molecules insulin-like biological activities present human liver.
