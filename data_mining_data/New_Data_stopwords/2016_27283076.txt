 Recently, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) implicated progression certain cancers might play pivotal roles formation malignancy. However, role PKM2 gallbladder cancer well investigated. study analyzed associations PKM2 expression status various clinical pathologic parameters large cohort gallbladder cancer (GBC) patients long term follow results. expression level pyruvate kinase isotypes GBC tissues adjacent normal gallbladder tissues estimated qRT-PCR Western blot. PKM2 mRNA level significantly high gallbladder cancer tissues adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.001). High expression PKM2 detected 55.71% paraffin-embedded GBC tissue. high PKM2 expression independently associated poorer overall survival patients GBC (median survival 11.9 vs 30.1 months; hazard ratio 2.79; 95% CI = 1.18 6.55; P = 0.02). findings indicated elevated expression PKM2 prognostic factor poor GBC clinical outcomes, implied involving PKM2 GBC progression.
