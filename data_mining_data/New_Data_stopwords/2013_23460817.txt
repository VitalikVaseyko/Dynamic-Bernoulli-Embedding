 BACKGROUND: Increased glycolysis hallmark cancer metabolism, yet relatively little known phenotype premalignant stages progression. Periodic ischemia occurs premalignant condition Barrett's esophagus (BE) due tissue damage chronic acid-bile reflux may select early adaptations hypoxia, including upregulation glycolysis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: compared rates glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation four cell lines derived patients (CP-A, CP-B, CP-C CP-D) response metabolic inhibitors changes glucose concentration. report cell lines derived patients advanced genetically unstable two-fold higher glycolysis compared cell line derived patient early genetically stable BE; however, cell lines preserve active mitochondria. response glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose, glycolytic cell lines (CP-C CP-D) greatest suppression extra-cellular acidification, able compensate upregulation oxidative phosphorylation. addition, cell lines showed lowest compensatory increases glycolysis response mitochondrial uncoupling 2,4-dinitrophenol. Finally, cell lines also upregulated oxidative phosphorylation response glucose via Crabtree effect, demonstrate greater range modulation oxygen consumption. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: findings suggest cells premalignant Barrett's esophagus tissue may adapt ever-changing selective microenvironment changes energy metabolic pathways typically associated cancer cells.
