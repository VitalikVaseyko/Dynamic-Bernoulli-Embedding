 previously shown prolonged high-saturated fat feeding (SAT) 8 weeks myocardial infarction (MI) improves ventricular function prevents metabolic remodeling commonly observed heart failure. current study designed delineate interplay markers energy metabolism indices cardiac remodeling 2 4 weeks post-MI SAT male Wistar rats. 2 weeks, less remodeling noted MI-SAT evidenced diminished chamber dilation greater ejection fraction assessed echocardiography hemodynamic measures. addition, gene expression energy metabolism targets involved FA uptake, oxidation, glucose oxidation regulation increased MI-SAT respect MI alone, although change PDH phosphorylation observed. regulatory kinase, phosphoinositide 3 kinase (Pi3k), strongly induced 2 weeks MI-SAT group, although AKT protein content (a primary downstream target PI3K affects metabolism) decreased MI SAT alone, indicating early involvement cellular signaling pathways lipid-mediated cardioprotection. results demonstrate cardioprotection occurs acutely SAT following MI, improvement indices cardiac function fatty acid oxidation, suggesting mechanistic role energy metabolism beneficial effects high dietary fat following cardiac injury.
