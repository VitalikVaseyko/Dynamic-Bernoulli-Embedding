 Deamidation asparaginyl isomerization aspartyl residues proteins produce mixture aspartyl isoaspartyl residues, latter involved protein aging inactivation. Electron capture dissociation (ECD) combined Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT MS) known able distinguish isoaspartyl peptides unique fragments cn* + 58.0054 (C2H2O2) z(l-n)-56.9976 (C2HO2), n position aspartyl residue l peptide length. present study, tested specificity isoAsp detection using accurate masses specific fragments. purpose, analyzed 32 whole partial proteomes obtained human cells well tissue samples identified ECD 466 isoaspartyl peptide candidates. Detailed inspection revealed many candidates unreliable. increase isoAsp detection specificity, additional criteria used, example, adjacent c/z fragments, specific losses reduced species, shape chromatographic peak. stringent filtering candidates yielded several cases presence isoAsp beyond doubt. Among identified proteins isoAsp, actin, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein pyruvate kinase previously identified substrates l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase, important repair enzyme converting isoaspartyl aspartyl. Quantification relative isomerization degree performed label-free approach. first attempt analyze human isoaspartome high-throughput manner. developed workflow allows enhancement detection rate isoaspartyl residues biological samples.
