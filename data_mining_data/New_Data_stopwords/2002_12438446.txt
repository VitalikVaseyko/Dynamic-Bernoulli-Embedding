 physiological relevance phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) signaling liver fuel homeostasis investigated. Systemic infusion adenovirus encoding dominant negative mutant PI 3-K ((Delta)p85) resulted liver-specific expression protein inhibition insulin-induced activation PI 3-K liver within 3 days, without affecting insulin signaling skeletal muscle. Hepatic expression (Delta)p85 led hyperinsulinemia marked increase blood glucose concentration response oral glucose intake. increases glycogen glucose 6-phosphate content, well Akt glycogen synthase activities liver, induced glucose intake markedly impaired mice expressing (Delta)p85. Despite upregulation mRNAs gluconeogenic enzymes apparent liver animals, fasting blood glucose concentration increased slightly, serum concentrations gluconeogenic precursors reduced. However, administration pyruvate, substrate gluconeogenesis, resulted exaggerated increase blood glucose concentration. fasted state, mass adipose tissue mice 1.5 times control mice. mice also exhibited marked decreases serum concentrations FFAs triglyceride suppression insulin-induced PI 3-K activation adipose tissue, probably due associated hyperinsulinemia. PI 3-K activity liver thus essential normal carbohydrate lipid metabolism living animals.
