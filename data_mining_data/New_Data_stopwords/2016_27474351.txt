 l-arginine, semi essential amino acid, important amino acid food flavoring pharmaceutical industries. production microbial fermentation gaining attention. previous work, obtained new l-arginine producing Corynebacterium crenatum (subspecies Corynebacterium glutamicum) mutation breeding. work, enhanced l-arginine production improvement intracellular environment. First, two NAD(P)H-dependent H2O2-forming flavin reductases Frd181 (encoded frd1 gene) Frd188 (encoded frd2) C. glutamicum identified first time. Next, roles Frd181 Frd188 C. glutamicum studied overexpression deletion encoding genes, results showed inactivation Frd181 Frd188 beneficial cell growth l-arginine production, owing decreased H2O2 synthesis intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, increased intracellular NADH ATP levels. Then, ATP level increased deletion noxA (encoding NADH oxidase) amn (encoding AMP nucleosidase), overexpression pgk (encoding 3-phosphoglycerate kinase) pyk (encoding pyruvate kinase), l-arginine production yield glucose significantly increased. fed-batch fermentation, l-arginine production yield glucose final strain reached 57.3g/L 0.326g/g, respectively, 49.2% 34.2% higher parent strain, respectively. ROS ATP important elements intracellular environment, l-arginine biosynthesis requires large amount ATP. first time, enhanced l-arginine production yield glucose reducing H2O2 synthesis increasing ATP supply.
