 metabolic pathways leading synthesis bacterial glycogen involve action several enzymes, among glycogen synthase (GS) catalyzes elongation alpha-1,4-glucan. GS Agrobacterium tumefaciens uses preferentially ADPGlc, although UDPGlc also used glycosyl donor less efficiency. present continuous spectrophotometric assay determination GS activity using ADP- UDPGlc. ADPGlc used substrate, production ADP coupled NADH oxidation via pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). UDPGlc substrate, UDP converted ADP via adenylate kinase subsequent coupling PK LDH reactions. Using assay, determined kinetic parameters GS compared obtained classical radiochemical method. purpose, improved expression procedure A. tumefaciens GS using Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-RIL cells. assay allows continuous monitoring glycosyltransferase activity using ADPGlc UDPGlc sugar-nucleotide donors.
