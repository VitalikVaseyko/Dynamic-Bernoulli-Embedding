 Women metabolic disorders, including obesity diabetes, increased risk developing endometrial cancer. However, metabolism endometrial tumors largely understudied. Comparing human endometrial tumors cells nonmalignant counterparts, found upregulation glucose transporter GLUT6 closely associated cancer phenotype hallmark cancer genes, including hexokinase 2 pyruvate kinase M2. Importantly, suppression GLUT6 expression inhibited glycolysis survival endometrial cancer cells. Glycolysis lipogenesis also highly coupled cancer phenotype patient samples cells. test whether targeting endometrial cancer metabolism could exploited therapeutic strategy, screened panel compounds known target diverse metabolic pathways endometrial cells. identified glycolytic inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate, powerful antagonist lipogenesis pyruvylation CoA. also provide evidence 3-bromopyruvate promotes cell death via necrotic mechanism involve reactive oxygen species 3-bromopyruvate impaired growth endometrial cancer xenografts.
