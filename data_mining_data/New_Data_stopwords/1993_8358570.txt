 1. isolated Langendorff-perfused, electrically-paced, hearts guinea-pigs, global low-flow-ischaemia (LFI; 0.7 ml min-1) resulted marked increases rates release lactate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) creatine kinase (CK) 30 min period. end LFI period, tissue ATP content significantly reduced control value 11.8 +/- 0.8 (5) 5.6 +/- 0.8 (5) mumol g-1 dry weight. 2. presence ranolazine [(+/-)-N-(2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-4[2-hydroxy-3-(2-methoxy-phenoxyl)- propyl] - l-piperazine acetamide dihydro-chloride; RS-43285-193] 10 microM, 20 min prior LFI, resulted significant reductions release lactate, LDH CK ischaemic period significant preservation tissue ATP (9.0 +/- 1.1 (6) mumol g-1 dry wt.). Ranolazine prevent reductions creatine phosphate glycogen observed LFI, significant effects contractile parameters LFI period. 3. Neither ranolazine LFI affected total amounts tissue pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity; however, significant reduction amount active, non-phosphorylated PDH caused LFI (from 88.2 +/- 5.5 44.2 +/- 3.2% total activity) partially significantly prevented ranolazine (67.2 +/- 6.8%). effect ranolazine PDH may part mechanism whereby compound reduces lactate release preserves tissue ATP ischaemia.
