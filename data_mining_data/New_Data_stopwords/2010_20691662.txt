 Akt signaling plays central role cell functions, proliferation, apoptosis, regulatory cell development. Phosphorylation Ser(473) hydrophobic motif, along Thr(308) activation loop, considered necessary Akt function. widely accepted phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1) phosphorylates Akt Thr(308), kinase(s) responsible phosphorylating Akt Ser(473) (PDK-2) remains elusive. existence PDK-2 considered specific cell type stimulus. PDK-2 cells response TCR stimulation clearly defined. study, found conventional PKC positively regulated TCR-induced Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation. PKC-alpha purified cells phosphorylate Akt Ser(473) vitro upon TCR stimulation. Knockdown PKC-alpha T-cell-line Jurkat cells reduced TCR-induced phosphorylation Akt well downstream targets. Thus results suggest PKC-alpha candidate PDK-2 cells upon TCR stimulation.
