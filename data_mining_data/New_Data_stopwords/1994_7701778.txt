 D-Glucose transport cytosolic enzyme activities measured erythrocytes 2-year-old thoroughbreds continuous training exercise (race horses) compared untrained horses various ages (sires, mares untrained 2-year-old thoroughbreds). activities glucose transport glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase pyruvate kinase, race horses' erythrocytes elevated 2-3.5 times untrained horses. significant differences plasma glucose, triglyceride IRI concentrations horses training untrained horses. increases glucose transport glycolytic enzyme activities erythrocytes considered reflect increased metabolic activity race horses resulting training exercises.
