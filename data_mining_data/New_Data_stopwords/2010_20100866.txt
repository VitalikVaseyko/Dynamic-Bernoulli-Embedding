 p32/gC1qR/C1QBP/HABP1 mitochondrial/cell surface protein overexpressed certain cancer cells. show knocking p32 expression human cancer cells strongly shifts metabolism oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) glycolysis. p32 knockdown cells exhibited reduced synthesis mitochondrial-DNA-encoded OXPHOS polypeptides less tumorigenic vivo. Expression exogenous p32 knockdown cells restored wild-type cellular phenotype tumorigenicity. Increased glucose consumption lactate production, known Warburg effect, almost universal hallmarks solid tumors thought favor tumor growth. However, show protein regularly overexpressed cancers capable promoting OXPHOS. results indicate high levels glycolysis, absence adequate OXPHOS, may beneficial tumor growth generally thought suggest tumor cells use p32 regulate balance OXPHOS glycolysis.
