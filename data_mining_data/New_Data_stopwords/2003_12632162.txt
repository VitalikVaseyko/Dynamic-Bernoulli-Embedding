 cloned cDNA encoding Toxoplasma gondii pyruvate kinase obtained full-length recombinant enzyme calculated molecular mass 57.5 kDa. predicted amino acid sequence T. gondii pyruvate kinase exhibited highest identity (63%) Eimeria tenella pyruvate kinase lower identity less 25% pyruvate kinases organisms. Southern blot analysis indicated pyruvate kinase gene existed single copy T. gondii tachyzoite. active recombinant enzyme contained four subunits produced strongly sigmoid saturation curve phosphoenolpyruvate variable substrate. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate, general activating factor pyruvate kinase species, affect enzyme activity. However, glucose 6-phosphate radically activated enzyme. Fructose 2,6-diphosphate suppressed reaction velocity higher concentration phosphoenolpyruvate. properties indicate pyruvate kinase activity T. gondii regulated unusual phosphorylated sugars.
