 PURPOSE: Metabolic dependence glucose utilisation described different tumours characterised activation Akt, upregulation GLUT1, M2PK TKTL1. date, however, little known glucose metabolism breast cancer tissue. METHODS: analysed 55 breast cancer specimens, 26 adjacent ductal carcinomas situ (DCIS) 23 adjacent normal breast tissues expression glycolytic markers immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: found expression pAkt 49%, GLUT1 25%, M2PK 68% TKTL1 31% tumours investigated. Expression pAkt Her2neu positively correlated borderline significance (P = 0.055). Expression pAkt, GLUT1 TKTL1 higher breast cancer DCIS normal tissue. Surprisingly, M2PK expression highest normal breast tissue. CONCLUSIONS: found glycolytic phenotype high percentage breast cancer samples. Inhibition glycolysis might evolve future option breast cancer therapy.
