 Dichloroacetate (DCA), commonly used treat metabolic disorders, investigation anti-cancer therapy due ability reverse Warburg effect induce apoptosis tumor cells. DCA's mechanism action well-studied, factors influence potential cancer treatment thoroughly investigated. show expression glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), enzyme responsible conversion DCA inactive metabolite, glyoxylate, downregulated liver cancer upregulated breast cancers, leading abnormal expression protein. cellular concentration chloride, ion influences stability GSTZ1 presence DCA, also found abnormal tumors, consistently higher concentrations hepatocellular carcinoma surrounding non-tumor tissue. Finally, results experiments employing two- three-dimensional cultures HepG2 cells, parental transduced express GSTZ1, demonstrate high levels GSTZ1 expression confers resistance effect high concentrations DCA cell viability. results may important clinical implications determining intratumoral metabolism DCA and, consequently, appropriate oral dosing.
