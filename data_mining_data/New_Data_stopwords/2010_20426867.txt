 BACKGROUND: liver plays major role metabolism performs number vital functions body. Therefore, determination hepatic metabolite dynamics analysis control respective biochemical pathways great pharmacological medical importance. Extra- intracellular time-series data stimulus-response experiments gaining importance identification vivo metabolite dynamics, dynamic network models excellent tools analyzing complex metabolic control patterns. first study undertaken data-driven identification dynamic liver central carbon metabolism model application analysis distribution metabolic control hepatoma cells. RESULTS: Dynamic metabolite data collected HepG2 cells deprived extracellular glucose. concentration 25 extra- intracellular intermediates quantified using HPLC, LC-MS-MS, GC-MS. silico metabolite dynamics accordance experimental data. central carbon metabolism hepatomas analyzed particular focus control metabolite concentrations metabolic fluxes. observed enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase exerted substantial negative control glycolytic flux, whereas oxidative phosphorylation significant positive control. control rate NADPH consumption found shared NADPH-demand (0.65) NADPH supply (0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Based time-series data, dynamic central carbon metabolism model developed investigation new complex metabolic control patterns hepatoma cells. control patterns found support hypotheses glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Warburg effect promising targets tumor treatment. systems-oriented identification metabolite dynamics first step towards genome-based assessment potential risks posed nutrients drugs.
