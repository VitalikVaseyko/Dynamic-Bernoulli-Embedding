 well-characterized metabolic landmark aggressive cancers reprogramming oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis, referred Warburg effect. Models mimicking process often incomplete due genetic complexities tumors cell lines containing unmapped collaborating mutations. order establish system individual components oncogenic signals metabolic pathways readily elucidated, induced glycolytic tumor Drosophila wing imaginal disc activating oncogene PDGF/VEGF-receptor (Pvr). causes activation multiple oncogenic pathways including Ras, PI3K/Akt, Raf/ERK, Src JNK. Together network genes stabilizes Hifalpha (Sima) turn, transcriptionally up-regulates many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. Collectively, network genes also causes inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity resulting diminished ox-phos levels. high ROS produced process functions feedback signal consolidate metabolic reprogramming.
