 study aimed assess effects carbohydrate (CHO) fat intake expression key genes related nutrient partitioning metabolism main tissues involved energy metabolism (white adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle). Rats studied different conditions: feeding state, 24 h fasting, 12 h refeeding 24 h fasting isocaloric amounts CHO fat. Fat, CHO, refeeding associated increase serum liver triglyceride content. Main changes gene expression elicited CHO compared fat refeeding were: 1) higher expression levels genes related lipogenesis (PPARgamma2, ChREBP, FAS), glucose uptake metabolism (GLUT4, HKII), fatty acid uptake (LPL, CD36), lipolysis (ATGL, HSL) white adipose tissue; 2) higher expression levels genes related lipogenesis (FAS, SCD1) lower ones related fatty acid uptake (CD36) oxidation (PPARalpha, CPT1, PDK4) liver; 3) higher expression levels GLUT4 lower ones related fatty acid oxidation (PDK4 UCP3) muscle. worth mentioning CHO fat refeeding resulted robust increase hepatic mRNA circulating levels fibroblast growth factor-21, compared fasted levels. summary, results, showing marked differences gene expression CHO fat refeeding, explain diet-associated differences fuel handling partitioning tissues; addition, role fibroblast growth factor-21 metabolic adaptations, ketotic state also face unbalanced nutritional situation, suggested.
