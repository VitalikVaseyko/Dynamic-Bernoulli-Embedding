 Epimastigotes Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent Chagas disease, catabolize proteins amino acids production MH3, glucose production reduced catabolites, chiefly succinate L-alanine, even aerobic conditions. "aerobic fermentation glucose" probably due presence low levels cytochromes, causing relative inefficiency respiratory chain NADH, reoxidation active glucose catabolism, lack NADH dehydrogenase phosphorylation site I, resulting entry reduction equivalents chain mostly succinate. Phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase may play essential role diverting glucose carbon succinate L-alanine, L-malate seems major metabolite transport glucose carbon reduction equivalents glycosome mitochondrion. parasite contains proteinase peptidase activities. major lysosomal cysteine proteinase, cruzipain, characterized considerable detail, might involved host/parasite relationship, addition obvious role parasite nutrition. Among enzymes amino acid catabolism, two glutamate dehydrogenases (one NADP- NAD-linked), alanine aminotransferase, major enzymes aromatic amino acid catabolism (tyrosine aminotransferase aromatic alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase), characterized proposed involved reoxidation glycolytic NADH.
