 Cellular metabolic reprogramming main characteristic cancer cells identification targets using metabolic pattern extremely important treat cancers, osteosarcoma (OS). study, SLIT2 ROBO1 upregulated OS, higher expression ROBO1 associated worse overall survival rate. Furthermore, vitro vivo experiments demonstrated SLIT2/ROBO1 axis promotes proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, contributes Warburg effect OS cells. Mechanistically, SLIT2/ROBO1 axis exerted cancer-promoting effects OS via activation SRC/ERK/c-MYC/PFKFB2 pathway. Taken together, findings reveal previously unappreciated function SLIT2/ROBO1 signaling OS, intertwined metabolic alterations promote cancer progression. Targeting SLIT2/ROBO1 axis may potential therapeutic approach patients OS.
