 Liver key genes carbohydrate lipid homeostasis regulated insulin glucose. sterol regulatory-element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) emerged mediator insulin effects gene transcription, particularly glucokinase (GK). paper, show despite stimulation GK promoter transcription overexpression mature SREBP-1c, insulin induced GK transcription least 4h ahead accumulation mature SREBP-1c nucleus. Importantly, knockdown SREBP-1 mRNA using RNA-interference technique reduced level nuclear SREBP-1 protein, diminished fatty acid synthase mRNA level, affect GK L-pyruvate kinase mRNA levels. concluded SREBP-1 unlikely mediator early insulin effect GK gene transcription.
