 BACKGROUND AIMS: Growing evidence shown M2-PK involved cancer diagnosis prognosis. overall diagnostic accuracy pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK) biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) remains controversial. performed meta-analysis evaluate diagnostic value M2-PK BTC. METHODS: online PubMed, Cochrane, Web Science, Embase databases searched eligible studies published August 8th, 2017. Quality Assessment Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) used evaluate study quality. statistical analyses conducted Stata 12.0. RESULTS: included 7 studies 5 articles 410 patients BTC 438 controls. pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), AUC M2-PK diagnosis BTC 0.79 (95%CI 0.70-0.86), 0.81 (95%CI 0.71-0.88), 4.1 (95%CI 2.5-6.8), 0.26 (95%CI 0.16-0.41), 17.159 (95%CI 5.468-54.071), 0.87 (95%CI 0.83-0.89), respectively. indicators assessed CA19-9 follows: 0.70 (95%CI 0.62-0.77), 0.71 (95%CI 0.45-0.87), 2.38 (95%CI 1.2-4.73), 0.43 (95%CI 0.34-0.53), 6.28 (95%CI 2.4-16.44) 0.73 (95%CI 0.69-0.77), respectively. Additionally, diagnostic value M2-PK varied based characteristics golden methods different cut-off values. CONCLUSIONS: meta-analysis showed M2-PK better diagnostic accuracy BTC compared CA19-9, moderate diagnostic performance. However, prospective studies required confirm diagnostic value.
