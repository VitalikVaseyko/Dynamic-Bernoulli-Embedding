 Cancer stem cells (CSCs) sub-population quiescent cells endowed self-renewal properties sustain malignant behavior tumor mass giving rise differentiated cancer cells. reason, specific killing CSCs represents one important challenges modern molecular oncology. However, particular resistance traditional chemotherapy radiotherapy imposes thorough understanding biological biochemical features. metabolic peculiarities CSCs may therapeutic diagnostic opportunity cancer research. review, summarize significant discoveries metabolism CSCs describing critically analyzing studies supporting either glycolysis mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation primary source energy CSCs.
