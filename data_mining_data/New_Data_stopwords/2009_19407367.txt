 Autoantibody response tumor antigens widely used identify novel tumor markers different cancers, including head neck. oral cavity, head neck region, comprises many sub sites distinct biologies incidence cancer sub site oral cavity different. anticipated therefore sub site oral cavity may elicit differential autoantibody response. report evaluates autoantibody response 15 patients cancer gingivo-buccal complex 15 patients cancer tongue using Immunoproteomics, shows autoantibody response alpha-enolase, HSP 70, peroxiredoxin-VI, annexin II, pyruvate kinase, alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, ATP synthase, triose phosphate isomerase aldose reductase seen patients cancer gingivo-buccal complex absent patients cancer tongue. suggests cancer sub sites studied separately different biology emerging site specific molecular signatures including autoantibody responses ensure unambiguous clinical interpretations.
