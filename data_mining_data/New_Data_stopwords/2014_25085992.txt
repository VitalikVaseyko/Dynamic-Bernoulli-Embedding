 early twentieth century, Otto Heinrich Warburg described elevated rate glycolysis occurring cancer cells, even presence atmospheric oxygen (the Warburg effect). Despite inefficiency ATP generation glycolysis, breakdown glucose lactate provides cancer cells number advantages, including ability withstand fluctuations oxygen levels, production intermediates serve building blocks support rapid proliferation. Recent evidence many cancer types supports notion pervasive metabolic reprogramming cancer stromal cells crucial feature neoplastic transformation. Two key transcription factors play major roles metabolic reprogramming hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF1) MYC. Sirtuin-family deacetylases regulate diverse biological processes, including many aspects tumor biology. Recently, sirtuin SIRT6 shown inhibit transcriptional output HIF1 MYC, function tumor suppressor. Review, highlight importance HIF1 MYC regulating tumor metabolism regulation sirtuins, main focus SIRT6.
