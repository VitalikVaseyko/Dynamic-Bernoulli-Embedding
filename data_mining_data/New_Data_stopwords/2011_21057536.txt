 conditions reduced tissue oxygenation, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) controls many processes, including angiogenesis cellular metabolism, also influences cell proliferation survival decisions. HIF centrally involved tumour growth inherited diseases give rise renal cell carcinoma (RCC), Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome tuberous sclerosis complex. study, examined whether HIF involved tumour formation RCC Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. this, analysed Birt-Hogg-Dube patient-derived renal tumour cell line (UOK257) devoid Birt-Hogg-Dube protein (BHD) observed high levels HIF activity. Knockdown BHD expression also caused threefold activation HIF, consequence HIF1alpha HIF2alpha protein. Transcription HIF target genes VEGF, BNIP3 CCND1 also increased. found nuclear localization HIF1alpha increased expression VEGF, BNIP3 GLUT1 chromophobe carcinoma Birt-Hogg-Dube patient. data also reveal UOK257 cells high lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. observed increased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (a HIF gene target), turn leads increased phosphorylation inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase. Together increased protein levels GLUT1, data reveal UOK257 cells favour glycolytic rather lipid metabolism (a cancer phenomenon termed 'Warburg effect'). UOK257 cells also possessed higher expression level L-lactate influx monocarboxylate transporter 1 consequently utilized L-lactate metabolic fuel. result higher dependency glycolysis, able selectively inhibit growth UOK257 cells treatment 2-deoxyglucose. work suggests targeting glycolytic metabolism may used therapeutically treat Birt-Hogg-Dube-associated renal lesions.
