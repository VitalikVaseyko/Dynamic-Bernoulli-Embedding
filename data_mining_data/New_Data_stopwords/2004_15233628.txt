 HNF4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha) belongs complex transcription factor network crucial function hepatocytes pancreatic beta-cells. cells, activates expression large number genes, including genes involved transport metabolism glucose lipids. Mutations HNF4alpha gene correlate MODY1 (maturity-onset diabetes young 1), form type II diabetes characterized impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion. MODY1 G115S (Gly115-->Ser) HNF4alpha mutation located DNA-binding domain nuclear receptor. show G115S mutation failed affect HNF4alpha-mediated transcription apolipoprotein promoters HepG2 cells. Conversely, pancreatic beta-cell lines, mutation resulted strong impairments HNF4alpha transcriptional activity promoters LPK (liver pyruvate kinase) HNF1alpha, transcription factor playing key role endocrine pancreas. show well G115S mutation creates PKA (protein kinase A) phosphorylation site, PKA-mediated phosphorylation results decreased transcriptional activity mutant. Moreover, G115E (Gly115-->Glu) mutation mimicking phosphorylation reduced HNF4alpha DNA-binding transcriptional activities. results may account 100% penetrance diabetes human carriers mutation. addition, suggest introduction phosphorylation site DNA-binding domain may represent new mechanism MODY1 mutation leads loss HNF4alpha function.
