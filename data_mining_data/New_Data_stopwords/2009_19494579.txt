 PEP-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase systems (PTSs) enteric bacteria constitute complex sensory system involves central element PEP-dependent His-protein kinase (Enzyme I). unit, PTS comprises 20 different transporters per cell correspond chemoreceptors PTS carbohydrates, several targeting subunits, include low [G+C] Gram-positive bacteria ancillary Ser/Thr-protein kinase. PTS senses presence carbohydrates, particular glucose, medium energy state cell, form either intracellular PEP-to-pyruvate ratio D-fructose-bisphosphate levels. information subsequently communicated cellular targets, particular involved chemotactic response cell towards PTS carbohydrates, sensing glucose medium, using cAMP several targeting subunits intermediates. Peptide targeting subunits ensure fast, transient, yet accurate communication PTS hundred different targets, avoiding time unwanted cross-talk. Many elements sensory system simultaneously elements specific global regulatory networks. Thus, PTS controls, besides immediate (in ms range) chemotactic responses, activity various carbohydrate transporters enzymes involved carbon energy metabolism inducer exclusion, delayed response (in min h range) synthesis transporters catabolic enzymes catabolite repression. Indirect consequences program phenomena related cell surface rearrangements, include flagella synthesis, well memory, adaptation, learning effects. analogy PTS prokaryotic systems, complex sensory systems eukaryotic organisms share elements regulatory systems obvious.
