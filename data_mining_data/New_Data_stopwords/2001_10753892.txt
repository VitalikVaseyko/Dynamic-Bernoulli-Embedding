 investigated impact GLUT2 gene inactivation regulation hepatic glucose metabolism fed fast transition. control GLUT2-null mice, fasting accompanied approximately 10-fold increase plasma glucagon insulin ratio, similar activation liver glycogen phosphorylase inhibition glycogen synthase elevation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glucose-6-phosphatase mRNAs. GLUT2-null mice, mobilization glycogen stores was, however, strongly impaired. correlated glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) levels, remained fed values, indicating important allosteric stimulation glycogen synthase G6P. G6P levels also accompanied paradoxical elevation mRNAs L-pyruvate kinase. Re-expression GLUT2 liver corrected abnormal regulation glycogen L-pyruvate kinase gene expression. Interestingly, GLUT2-null livers hyperplasic, revealed 40% increase liver mass 30% increase liver DNA content. Together, data indicate absence GLUT2, G6P levels cannot decrease fasting period. may due neosynthesized glucose entering cytosol, unable diffuse extracellular space, phosphorylated back G6P. hepatic glucose production nevertheless quantitatively normal, glucose produced endoplasmic reticulum may also exported cell alternative, membrane traffic-based pathway, previously reported (Guillam, M.-T., Burcelin, R., Thorens, B. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 12317-12321). Therefore, fasting, GLUT2 required quantitative normal glucose output necessary equilibrate cytosolic glucose extracellular space. absence equilibration, control hepatic glucose metabolism G6P dominant plasma hormone concentrations.
