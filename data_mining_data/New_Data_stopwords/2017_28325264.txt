 BACKGROUND: Coined "Warburg effect" recognized hallmark cancer, energy metabolism aberrantly geared towards aerobic glycolysis human cancers, including malignant glioma. Ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT), i.e. nutritional intervention ketogenic low-glycemic diets, proposed anti-neoplastic strategy glioma patients. MATERIALS METHODS: review rationale existing data investigating KMT management patients malignant glioma discuss promise potential challenges novel strategy. Results published clinical studies ongoing clinical trials topic systematically reviewed, including 6 published original articles 10 ongoing clinical trials. Search criteria review entailed databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Google Scholar, well ICTRP (WHO) ClinicalTrials.gov (NIH) registries. RESULTS: substantial amount preclinical literature demonstrates KMT efficacy safety model systems malignant glioma. Clinical literature indicates KMT safety feasibility; 2 clinical studies suggest KMT-associated anti-neoplastic efficacy clinical benefit. Ongoing clinical trials address KMT safety metabolic impact, patient compliance, patient clinical/survival benefit. CONCLUSIONS: clinical evidence still limited evolving field, increasing numbers ongoing clinical trials suggest KMT emerging potential therapeutic option might combinable existing anti-neoplastic treatments malignant glioma. Emerging clinical data help answer questions concerning safety efficacy KMT, aiming identify promising KMT regimen, compatibility anti-cancer treatments, ethical aspects, impact quality life cancer patients.
