 Aerobic glycolysis enables cancer cells rapidly take nutrients (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, lipids) incorporate biomass needed produce new cell. contrast existing chemotherapy/radiotherapy strategies, inhibiting aerobic glycolysis limit adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) yield highly efficient approach suppressing tumor cell proliferation. However, most, all, current inhibitors aerobic glycolysis cause significant adverse effects nonspecific delivery distribution nondiseased organs, low bioavailability, narrow therapeutic window. New strategies enhance biosafety efficacy inhibitors needed moving clinical applications. address need, developed liposomal nanocarrier functionalized well-validated tumor-targeting peptide specifically deliver aerobic glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) tumor tissue. nanoparticles effectively targeted tumors systemic administration tumor-bearing mice suppressed tumor growth locally releasing 3-BP inhibit ATP production tumor cells. overt side effects observed major organs. report demonstrates potential utility nanoparticle-enabled delivery aerobic glycolysis inhibitor anticancer therapeutic agent.
