 Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 naturally produces wax esters could used raw material industrial applications. attempted improve wax ester yield A. baylyi ADP1 removing rmlA, gene involved exopolysaccharide production. Growth rate, biomass formation wax ester yield 4-hydroxybenzoate affected, rmlA (-) strain grew slower acetate, reaching similar biomass wax ester yield. rmlA (-) cells malformed shape large size grew poorly glucose without expression gene pyruvate kinase (pykF) Escherichia coli. pykF-expressing rmlA (-) strain similar growth rate, lowered biomass formation improved wax ester production glucose compared wild-type strain expressing pykF. Cultivation pykF-expressing rmlA (-) strain elevated glucose concentration medium supplemented amino acids resulted doubled molar wax ester yield acetate production.
