 significant tuning optoelectronic properties polythiophene (PT) chains due Hofmeister iodide (I(-)) ion demonstrated ampholytic polythiophene [polythiophene-g-poly{(N,N,N-trimethylamino iodide)ethyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid}, APT] different pHs. acidic medium, absorption emission signals PT chromophore exhibit appreciable blue shift presence I(-) counteranion only. cooperative effect undissociated -COOH quaternary ammonium groups immobilize I(-) near apolar PT chain causing threading grafted chains hence twisting backbone attributing blue shift. medium pH increased, dethreading PT backbone occurs due ionization -COOH group, releasing quencher iodide ions vicinity PT chains resulting red shift absorption sharp hike fluorescence intensity (390 times) increase excitons lifetime. increase pH, morphology changes multivesicular aggregate vacuoles smaller size vesicles finally nanofibrillar network structure. Dethreading also found APT interacts RNA showing significant hike fluorescence (22 times) displacing iodide ions forming nanofibrillar network morphology. Threading dethreading also affect resistance, capacitance, Warburg impedance values APT. Molecular dynamics simulation model APT chain water box supports threading lower pH iodide ions pose nearer PT chain higher pH causing dethreading. influence Hofmeister I(-) ion established tuning optoelectronic properties novel PT based polyampholyte changing pH conjugating RNA.
