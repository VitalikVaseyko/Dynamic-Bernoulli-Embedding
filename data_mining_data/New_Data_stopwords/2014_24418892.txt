 investigated roles splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) human breast cancer. found PTBP1 upregulated progressively transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), well breast tumor cell lines compared HMECs finite growth potential found level PTBP1 correlated transformation state HMECs. Knockdown PTBP1 expression substantially inhibited tumor cell growth, colony formation soft agar vitro invasiveness breast cancer cell lines, result similar reported ovarian cancer. However, ectopic expression PTBP1 (as PTBP1-EGFP fusion protein) enhance proliferation immortalized HMEC. Rather, PTBP1 expression promoted anchorage-independent growth immortalized HMEC assessed increased colony formation soft agar. addition, found knockdown PTBP1 expression led upregulation expression M1 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM1) increase ratio PKM1 vs PKM2. PKM1 reported promote oxidative phosphorylation reduce tumorigenesis. Correspondingly, observed increased oxygen consumption PTBP1-knockdown breast cancer cells. Together, results suggest PTBP1 associated breast tumorigenesis appears required tumor cell growth maintenance transformed properties. PTBP1 exerts effects, part, regulating splicing pyruvate kinase, consequently alters glucose metabolism contributes Warburg effect.
