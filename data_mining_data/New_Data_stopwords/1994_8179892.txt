 designed new method high resolution electrophoretic separation proteins similar molecular weights. proteins migrate first conventional gradient gel, molecular friction increases pore size decreases. proteins enter inverted sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gradient gel friction decreases; thus, smaller molecules gradually migrate faster achieve improved separation larger molecules, remain near border two gels. therefore call technique double-inverted gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (DG-PAGE). technique used resolve mixtures aldolase, horseradish peroxidase precursors, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. comparison established methods, show DG-PAGE higher resolving power, achieves clear separation proteins differing little 0.5 kDa molecular weight.
