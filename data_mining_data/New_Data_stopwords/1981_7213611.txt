 structural transitions tetrameric rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase induced guanidine hydrochloride urea characterized elastic quasi-elastic light-scattering, sedimentation velocity, intrinsic viscosity experiments well protein fluorescence, circular dichroism, enzymic activity measurements. transition curves shown reversible. find new pathway unfolding different described literature: first intermediate increasing concentration denaturant less compact inactive tetramer renatured substrates added. Dissociation tetramer results expanded dimer partial loss secondary structure. final state completely disordered monomer. intermediates consistent domain structure pyruvate kinase, suggested Stammers & Muirhead [Stammers, D.
