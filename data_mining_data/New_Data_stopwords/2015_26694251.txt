 Despite advances therapy, glioblastoma (GBM) still prevalent lethal brain tumor. Thus, imperative identify new effective therapies could improve lifetime patients. known tumor cells, glioblastomas present metabolic reprogramming, named "Warburg effect", recognized nowadays hallmark cancer. mechanism associated high dependence tumor cells glycolytic metabolism sustain energy demands macromolecule synthesis, leading production high amounts lactic carbonic acids. metabolic products induce microenvironment acidification, due up-regulation several proteins, monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) carbonic anhydrases (CAs), maintain glycolytic phenotype intracellular physiological pH. dependence glycolytic metabolism acidic microenvironment acquired resistance standard therapy research focus glioblastoma therapy response. review, intend highlight evidence importance lactate transporters pH regulators GBMs, frequently overexpressed GBMs associated tumor aggressiveness. Moreover, describe targeting proteins could constitute new therapeutic strategies overcome glioma resistance therapy.
