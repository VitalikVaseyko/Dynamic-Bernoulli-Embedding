 Salmonella typhimurium mutant lacking Enzyme HPr, general proteins phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), producing homologues EI(Fructose) FPr constitutively, grow minimal medium supplemented non-PTS sugars (melibiose, glycerol, maltose) absence trace Luria-Bertani broth; adding cyclic AMP allowed growth. melibiose, rapid growth began melibiose permease activity reached threshold level. Wild-type cultures reached level within 2 h, mutant 12-14 h lag period, cyclic AMP added medium. mixture melibiose PTS sugar, permease undetectable either wild type mutant PTS sugar exhausted. Permease appeared, increasing time, mutant never reached threshold allowing rapid growth melibiose unless cyclic AMP added. rich medium supplemented melibiose glycerol, mutant produced lower (30%) levels melibiose permease glycerol kinase compared wild type. propose poor phosphorylation regulatory protein Enzyme IIA(Glucose), leading constitutive inducer exclusion catabolite repression strain, accounts results.
