 Genes encoding branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase Enterococcus faecalis 10C1, E1alpha (bkdA), E1beta (bkdB), E2 (bkdC), E3 (bkdD), found reside gene cluster ptb-buk-bkdDABC. predicted products ptb buk exhibited significant homology phosphotransbutyrylase butyrate kinase, respectively, Clostridium acetobutylicum. Activity redox properties purified recombinant enzyme encoded bkdD indicate E. faecalis lipoamide dehydrogenase distinct lipoamide dehydrogenase associated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Specific activity ptb gene product expressed Escherichia coli highest substrates valeryl-coenzyme (CoA), isovaleryl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA. cultures, stoichiometric conversion alpha-ketoisocaproate isovalerate observed, concomitant increase biomass. propose alpha-ketoisocaproate converted via BKDH complex isovaleryl-CoA subsequently converted isovalerate via combined actions ptb buk gene products concomitant phosphorylation ADP. contrast, E. faecalis bkd mutant constructed disruption bkdA gene benefit alpha-ketoisocaproate growth medium, conversion isovalerate less 2% wild-type conversion. concluded bkd gene cluster encodes enzymes constitute catabolic pathway branched-chain alpha-keto acids previously unidentified E. faecalis.
