 present study designed evaluate cardioprotective potential pyruvate characterize mechanism underlying protection. Wistar albino rats randomly divided three groups. Two groups administered saline orally (sham, ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) control group) animals third group received pyruvate (500 mg/kg) 4 weeks. 29th day, animals I-R control pyruvate treated groups underwent 45 min occlusion left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery thereafter reperfused 60 min. I-R control group, significant cardiac necrosis, depressed mean arterial pressure (MAP) heart rate (HR), decline myocardial antioxidant status elevation lipid peroxidation observed compared sham control. Pyruvate treatment restored myocardial antioxidant status favorably modulated altered MAP compared I-R control. Furthermore, I/R-induced lipid peroxidation significantly inhibited pyruvate treatment. beneficial cardioprotective effects translated significant improvement MAP. Histopathological examination restored specific myocardial injury marker CK-MB isoenzyme activity confirmed protective effects pyruvate. conclusion, study demonstrated beneficial effect pyruvate likely results improved MAP suppression oxidative stress.
