 Peptide sequences fused gene interest facilitate isolation proteins protein complexes cell extracts. case fluorescent protein tags, tagged protein visually localized living cells. tag endogenous genes, PCR-based homologous recombination powerful approach used yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. approach uses short, homologous DNA sequences flank tagging cassette direct recombination. Here, constructed set plasmids, whose sequences optimized codon usage yeast, Strep-tag II Twin-Strep tagging S. cerevisiae. plasmids also contain sequences encoding fluorescent protein followed purification tag. demonstrate using yeast pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex plasmids used purify large protein complexes efficiently. furthermore demonstrate purification endogenous pool using Strep-tag system results functionally active complexes. Finally, using fluorescent tags, show kinase phosphatase involved regulating activity PDH complex localize cells' mitochondria. conclusion, cassettes used tools biochemical, functional, structural analyses endogenous multi-protein assemblies yeast.
