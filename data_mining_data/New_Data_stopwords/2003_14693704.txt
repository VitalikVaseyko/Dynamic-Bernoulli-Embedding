 Type 1 diabetes results destruction insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells beta-cell-specific autoimmune process. Although converting cell types insulin-producing cells may compensate loss beta-cell mass evading beta-cell-specific T-cell responses, proof-of-principle approach large animal models lacking. investigation initiated determine whether insulin-producing human hepatocyte line control diabetes transplanted totally pancreatectomized diabetic pigs. established reversibly immortalized human hepatocyte line, YOCK-13, transferring human telomerase reverse transcriptase cDNA drug-inducible Cre recombinase cassette, followed cDNA modified insulin control L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promoter. YOCK-13 cells produced small amounts modified insulin detectable endogenous L-PK low glucose concentrations, whereas produced large amounts modified insulin L-PK response high glucose concentrations. Xenotransplantation YOCK-13 cells via portal vein immunosuppressed, totally pancreatectomized pigs decreased hyperglycemia prolonged survival without adverse effects portal thrombosis, liver necrosis, pulmonary embolism, tumor development. suggest reversibly immortalized, insulin-secreting human hepatocyte line may overcome shortage donor pancreata islet transplantation patients type 1 diabetes.
