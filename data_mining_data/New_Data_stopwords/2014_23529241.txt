 OBJECTIVE: investigate glycolytic phenotype SHG44 human glioma cells hypoxic conditions association cell proliferation apoptosis metabolic status. METHODS: vitro hypoxic cell model established SHG44 cells using CoCl2. Real-time PCR Western blotting used assess expressions hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) enzymes involved glycolysis including PDK1, PKM2, LDHA. Intracellular ATP levels measured bioluminescence assay assess energy metabolic status SHG44 cells. viability apoptosis cells examined using MTT assay flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: cells hypoxic culture showed obviously increased expressions HIF-1alpha, LDHA, PDK1, PKM2 mRNA protein levels compared normal cell culture. Hypoxia cells also resulted lowered cell proliferative activity increased apoptosis rate lowered intracellular ATP concentrations elevated mitochondrial membrane potential. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia induce glycolytic phenotype tumor cells. sensitivity tumor cells hypoxia-induced cell death directly correlated metabolic status.
