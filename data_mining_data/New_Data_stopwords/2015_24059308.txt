 Meta-analysis methods exist combining multiple microarray datasets. However, wide range issues associated microarray meta-analysis limited ability compare performance different metaanalysis methods. Using cDNA microarray technology (Partek Genomics Suite 6.6) global pathway analysis Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (IPA, Inc), examined transcript level type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients controls. understand molecular link T2DM AD, compared gene expression pattern pathway involved. Microarray analysis identified 235 differentially expressed genes T2DM patients controls; 834 AD controls two fold change false discovery rate 0.05. Significantly changed expression "myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1; RAS guanyl releasing protein 1; S100 calcium-binding protein A8; prostaglandin- endoperoxide synthase 2; parvalbumin; endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1; phosphoglycerate kinase 1; Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F; Interleukin-1 beta; tubulin, beta 2A; glycine receptor alpha 1 ribosomal protein S24" genes highly associated T2DM, whereas "neuronal differentiation 6; G-protein coupled receptor 83; phosphoserine phosphatase; bobby sox homolog HMG box -containing protein 2; Glutathione S-transferase theta 1; alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 zinc-binding; Heat shock 70kDa protein 1B; transportin 1, Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member B; Nuclear factor activated T-cells 5; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase B; prenylcysteine oxidase 1 like" found strongly related AD. also found set differentially expressed genes; "ARP2 actin-related protein 2; Cell division control protein 42; cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4; Early growth response protein 1; ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 5; folate receptor 1; glutamate-ammonia ligase; hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme reductase; 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; interleukin 1 receptor- like 1; leukemia inhibitory factor receptor; metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4; phosphoserine phosphatase, parvalbumin, tubulin, beta 2A" present dataset. Altered regulation intracellular signaling pathways, including Ephrin receptor, liver X receptor/ retinoid X receptor; interleukin 6; insulinlike growth factor 1; interleukin 10 14-3-3-mediated signaling pathways associated T2DM well Alzheimer-type pathology. findings implicate diabetic disorders pathogenesis AD, provide basis future candidate studies based specific pathways.
