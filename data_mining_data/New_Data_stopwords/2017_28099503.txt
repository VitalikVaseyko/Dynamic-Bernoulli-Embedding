 worldwide need human cornea equivalents continues grow. clinical options limited allogenic synthetic material replacements. hypothesized tissue engineered human cornea systems based mechanically robust, patterned, porous, thin, optically clear silk protein films, combination human corneal stromal stem cells (hCSSCs), would generate 3D functional corneal stroma tissue equivalents, comparison previously developed 2D approaches. Silk film contact guidance used control alignment distribution hCSSCs RGD-treated single porous silk films, stacked orthogonally, multi-layered architecture cultured 9 weeks. systems compared similar systems generated human corneal fibroblasts (hCFs). cell types viable preferentially aligned along biomaterial patterns 9 weeks culture. H&E histological sections showed systems seeded hCSSCs displayed ECM production throughout entire thickness constructs. addition, ECM proteins tested positive keratocyte-specific tissue markers, including keratan sulfate, lumican, keratocan. quantification hCSSC gene expression keratocyte-tissue markers, including keratocan, lumican, human aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1), prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTDGS), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4), within 3D tissue systems demonstrated upregulation compared 2D single silk films systems generated hCFs. Furthermore, production ECM hCSSC seeded systems subsequent remodeling initial matrix significantly improved cohesiveness mechanical performance constructs, maintaining transparency 9 weeks.
