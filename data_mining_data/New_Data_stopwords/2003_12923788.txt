 study, phosphoproteome Corynebacterium glutamicum, industrially important soil bacterium Corynebacterium/Mycobacterium/Nocardia (CMN) group Gram-positive bacteria, investigated two different detection methods: first, vivo radio-labeling using [(33)P]-phosphoric acid subsequent autoradiography second, immunostaining phosphoamino acid-specific monoclonal antibodies. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), around 60 [(33)P]-labeled protein spots visualized around 90 antibody-decorated protein spots detected; 31 protein spots detected methods. peptide mass fingerprinting, 41 different proteins identified, namely 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase, aconitase, acyl-CoA carboxylase, acyl-CoA synthetase, ATP (synthase alpha- beta-chain), carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, citrate synthase, cysteine synthase, DnaK, elongation factors G, P, Ts Tu, enolase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, fumarase, Gap dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase I, glycine hydroxymethyltransferase, GroEL2, GTPase, heat-inducible transcriptional repressor DnaJ2, inorganic pyrophosphatase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, ketol-acid reductoisomerase, lactate dehydrogenase, leucine-tRNA ligase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, methionine synthase, O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate oxidase, ribosomal protein S1, RNA polymerase (beta-subunit), succinyl-CoA:CoA transferase, transketolase UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine ligase, besides hypothetical 35k protein hypothetical glucose kinase. detection techniques used create phosphoproteome map. Additionally, influence nitrogen deprivation phosphoproteome C. glutamicum investigated.
