 fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, stationary phase-specific transcription factor Phx1 contributes long-term survival, stress tolerance, meiosis. identified Phx1-dependent genes transcriptome analysis, analyzed related carbohydrate thiamine metabolism, whose expression decreased phx1. Consistent mRNA changes, level thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) TPP-utilizing pyruvate decarboxylase activity converts pyruvate acetaldehyde also reduced mutant. Therefore, Phx1 appears shift metabolic flux diverting pyruvate TCA cycle respiration ethanol fermentation. Among four predicted genes pyruvate decarboxylase, Phx1-dependent genes (pdc201+ pdc202+) contributed long-term survival judged mutation overexpression studies. findings indicate Phx1-mediated long-term survival achieved primarily increasing synthesis activity pyruvate decarboxylase. Consistent hypothesis, observed Phx1 curtailed respiration cells entered stationary phase. Introduction Deltaphx1 mutation compromised long-lived phenotypes Deltapka1 Deltasck2 mutants devoid pro-aging kinases nutrient-signalling pathways, Deltapyp1 mutant constitutively activated stress-responsive kinase Sty1. Therefore, achievement long-term viability nutrient limitation anti-stress response appears dependent Phx1.
