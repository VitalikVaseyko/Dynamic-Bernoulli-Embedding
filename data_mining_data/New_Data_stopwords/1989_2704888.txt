 stress-susceptible stress-resistant pigs consumed diets containing 10 iu vitamin E kg-1, stress-susceptible pigs damaged cell membranes. indicated increased plasma activities creatine kinase pyruvate kinase. Plasma concentrations thiobarbituric acid reactive substances conjugated dienes also increased suggesting membrane damage caused free radicals. Susceptibility free radicals demonstrated increased tendency erythrocytes tissue homogenates stress-susceptible pigs peroxidise incubated hydrogen peroxide iron, respectively. Supplementation diets approximately 20 times normal requirements vitamin E decreased plasma creatine kinase pyruvate kinase activities, inhibited formation indices peroxidation vivo vitro. concluded stress-susceptible pig abnormality antioxidant defence mechanisms. However, abnormality due deficiency selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, since activities significantly increased longissimus dorsi stress-susceptible pigs. Although nature antioxidant defect unclear, suggested stress-susceptible pigs sustained oxidant stress decreased ability accommodate even normal free radical load may contribute rapid development fatal stress response.
