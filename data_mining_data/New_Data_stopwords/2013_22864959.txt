 BACKGROUND: early diagnosis biliary tract cancer (BTC) remains challenging, effective therapies. study investigated whether M2 isotype pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), serves key regulator cellular energy metabolism proliferating cells, could play role diagnosis therapy BTC. METHODS: Plasma bile M2-PK concentrations measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 88 patients BTC, 79 benign biliary diseases, 17 healthy controls. M2-PK expression assayed BTC tissue array immunohistochemistry. role M2-PK tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis evaluated BTC cell lines retrovirus-mediated M2-PK transfection short hairpin RNA silencing techniques. RESULTS: Sensitivity (90.3%) specificity (84.3%) bile M2-PK malignancy significantly higher plasma M2-PK serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9. M2-PK expression specific cancer cells correlated microvessel density. M2-PK positivity significant independent prognostic factor multivariable analysis. Transfection M2-PK negatively expressed cell line (HuCCT-1 cells) increased cell invasion, whereas silencing M2-PK-positive cell line (TFK cells) decreased tumor nodule formation cellular invasion. significant increase endothelial tube formation noted supernatants M2-PK-transfected cells added vitro angiogenesis assay, whereas supernatants silenced cells negated endothelial tube formation. CONCLUSIONS: Bile M2-PK novel tumor marker BTC correlates tumor aggressiveness poor outcome. Short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition M2-PK indicates potential M2-PK therapeutic target.
