 OBJECTIVE: Pleural effusion common diagnostic problem challenge thoracic surgeon. analysis serum body fluids tumor markers established diagnostic procedure. Among various markers, tumors linked overexpression glycolytic isoenzyme, M2-pyruvate-kinase (M2-PK). preliminary study evaluated enzyme tumor marker differentiate malignant benign pleural effusion. METHODS: tumor M2-PK concentration measured EDTA-plasma pleural fluid 34 patients established diagnosis cancer, either primary chest (18) secondary chest (16) 34 controls benign effusion. concentration quantitatively determined enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. cut-off level negative positive values tumor M2-PK defined benign group's mean+2SD (95% percentile). True-positives, false-positives, true-negatives, false-negatives, determined 'positive' referring histologically proven malignant effusion 'negative' referred nonmalignant effusions. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value assessed. RESULTS: cut-off value established 7.61 U/ml plasma 32.9 U/ml pleural fluid. plasma pleural fluid levels tumor M2-PK significantly higher patients known chest malignancy, either primary metastatic, compared nonmalignant effusions (p<0.001). Sensitivity pleural fluid significantly higher compared plasma (85.7% vs 76.2%; p<0.01). Moreover, negative predictive value higher pleural fluid compared plasma (79.4% vs 70.8; p<0.01) CONCLUSIONS: Tumor M2-PK marker useful differentiating malignant benign pleural effusions. Moreover, sensitivity NPV pleural fluid significantly higher compared plasma. usefulness test strictly diagnostic aims excluding poorly performing patients invasive procedures. Thus, inclusion M2-PK within panel well-known tumor markers CEA, MCA, Ca 125 Ca 19-9, may help increasing overall sensitivity specificity.
