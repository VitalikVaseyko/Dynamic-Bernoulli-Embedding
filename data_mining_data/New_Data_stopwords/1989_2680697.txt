 Short-term long-term biological activities studied adult rat hepatocytes cultured presence insulin analogues des-(B26-B30)-insulinamide, [TyrB25]des-(B26-B30)-insulinamide [HisB25]des-(B26-B30)-insulinamide. compared insulin, full potency des-(B26-B30)-insulinamide reported rat adipocytes enhanced potency reported analogues. Steady state binding characteristics analogues hepatocytes indistinguishable native insulin half-maximal binding occurring concentrations 0.8 nmol/l. Half-maximal effects stimulation glycolysis inhibition basal glucagon-activated glycogenolysis required identical concentrations insulin 3 analogues. Induction key glycolytic enzymes glucokinase pyruvate kinase well inhibition glucagon-dependent induction phosphenolpyruvate carboxy-kinase also required identical concentrations insulin 3 analogues. data confirm cultured hepatocytes C-terminal amidation des-(B26-B30)-insulin results molecule full vitro potency. contrast data obtained adipocytes, des-(B26-B30)-insulin-amidated analogues tyrosine histidine substitutions position B25 equally potent native insulin eliciting biological responses rat hepatocyte culture.
