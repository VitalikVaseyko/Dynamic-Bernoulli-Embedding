 studying primary isogenic murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), shown PLK3 null MEFs contain reduced level phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) increased Akt1 activation coupled decreased GSK3beta activation normoxia hypoxia. Purified recombinant Plk3, kinase-defective mutant, efficiently phosphorylates PTEN vitro. Mass spectrometry identifies threonine 366 serine 370 two putative residues phosphorylated Plk3. Immunoblotting using phosphospecific antibody confirms sites Plk3 phosphorylation sites. Moreover, treatment MEFs LiCl, inhibitor GSK3beta CK2, partially suppresses phosphorylation, suggesting Plk3 additional kinase phosphorylates sites vivo. Plk3-targeting mutants PTEN expressed reduced level comparison wild-type counterpart, associated enhanced activity PDK1, upstream activator Akt1. Furthermore, reduced level PTEN PLK3 null MEFs stabilized treatment MG132, proteosome inhibitor. Combined, study identifies Plk3 new player regulation PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling axis phosphorylation stabilization PTEN.
