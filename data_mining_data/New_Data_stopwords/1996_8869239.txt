 work Rhodotorula gracilis, studied level representative enzymes foundamental metabolic ways (HK, PK, G6PDH IDH) ICL MS key enzymes glyoxylate cycle different carbone sources. glucose appears best source carbone tested enzymes except ICL MS practically absent cells developed carbone source. presence acetate ethanol obtained expression glyoxylate cycle enzymes (ICL MS). Moreover obtained operativity glyoxylate cycle lipid-rich cells cells developped neutral detergents anionics similar fatty acids.
