 well known carbohydrate-rich diet promotes lipogenesis via induction hepatic lipogenic enzymes, whereas chronic physical exercise reduces body fat. purpose study investigate whether exercise training decrease diet-induced hepatic lipogenic enzymes total body fat composition. Female Sprague-Dawley rats randomly divided exercise trained (T) sedentary (S) groups. Training performed treadmill 8 weeks 25 m/minute, 15% grade 90 minutes/day, 5 days/week. groups divided four dietary treatments. Fifty percent calories diet basal ingredient 50% either cornstarch (C), glucose (G), fructose (Fr), fat (Fa). significantly decreased body fat increased body water content dietary groups (p < 0.01), effect body weight. Fr rats significantly heavier liver weight remaining groups. Activities hepatic fatty acid synthase, ATP-citrate lyase (CL), malic enzyme (ME), pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase significantly higher Fr lower Fa compared C G. Training significantly increased activities CL Fa, little effect enzymes groups. data suggest fat-reducing effect conventional exercise training elicited regulatory mechanisms reduction hepatic lipogenic enzymes.
