 tumorigenesis, shift oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis ATP production accounts dramatic change cellular metabolism represents one major steps leading tumour formation. so-called Warburg effect currently considered something mere modification cellular metabolism. paradox cancer cell proliferation increase energy need supplied glycolysis explained taking account many roles intermediates glycolysis TCA cycle play cellular physiology, besides energy production. Recent studies shown metabolic intermediates induce changes chromatin structure drive neo-angiogenesis. review, present latest findings study cancer metabolism particular attention tumour metabolism microenvironment favour tumour growth aggressiveness, hijacking dampening anti-tumoral immune response.
