 myeloid translocation gene 16 (MTG16) co-repressor regulates expression multiple glycolytic genes, targets hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) heterodimer transcription factor composed oxygen-regulated labile HIF1alpha stable HIF1beta subunits. reason, investigated whether MTG16 might regulate HIF1 negatively contributing inhibition glycolysis stimulation mitochondrial respiration. doxycycline Tet-On system used control levels MTG16 B-lymphoblastic Raji cells. Results co-association studies revealed MTG16 interact HIF1alpha. co-association required intact N-terminal MTG16 residues including Nervy Homology Region 1 (NHR1). Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated association MTG16 hypoxia response elements (HREs) PFKFB3, PFKFB4 PDK1 promoters in-vitro. Results chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed co-occupancy glycolytic gene promoters HIF1alpha, HIF1beta MTG16 agreement possible involvement proteins regulation glycolytic target genes. addition, MTG16 interacted prolyl hydroxylase D2 promoted ubiquitination proteasomal degradation HIF1alpha. findings broaden area MTG co-repressor functions reveal MTG16 part protein complex controls levels HIF1alpha.
