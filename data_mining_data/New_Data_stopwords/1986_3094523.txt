 Rat liver pyruvate kinase phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II serine threonine residues 3-4 kDa CNBr fragment located near amino terminus. two sites phosphorylation separated reverse-phase HPLC thermolysin digest. Sequence analysis established sites phosphorylation follows: Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(PO4)-Val-Ala-Gln-Leu-Thr(PO4)-Gln-Glu.
