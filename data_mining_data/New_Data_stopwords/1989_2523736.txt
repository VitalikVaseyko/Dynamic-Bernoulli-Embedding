 glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) studied adult fetal type II pneumocytes isolated rat lung different days development. addition, activities enzymes hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) assayed. specific activities latter enzymes decrease perinatal development reach adult values shortly birth. contrast, 6-phosphofructokinase activity increases slightly 2 days birth, drops sharply afterwards. 6-phosphofructokinase subunit composition determined fetal adult type II cells. ratio three subunits 6-phosphofructokinase type II cells isolated fetal days 19 21 (term day 22) adult type II cells identical: three subunits present ratio 68: 14: 18 types L, C, respectively. addition, investigated regulatory properties 6-phosphofructokinase alveolar type II cells. 6-Phosphofructokinase alveolar type II cells strongly inhibited increasing MgATP concentrations. inhibition reflected increase S0.5 fructose 6-phosphate. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate stimulates alveolar type II 6-phosphofructokinase. Half-maximal stimulation occurs 1.6 2.0 microM fructose 2,6-bisphosphate fetal adult type II cells, respectively. level potent positive effector 6-phosphofructokinase, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, also determined. level hexose bisphosphate decreases prenatal development; however, level adult type II cells considerably lower. concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate appears sufficient fully activate 6-phosphofructokinase fetal adult type II cells.
