 recently mapped protein interaction network methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), revealed scale-free organization characteristic presence highly connected hub proteins critical bacterial survival. report discovery inhibitors highly potent one hub target, staphylococcal pyruvate kinase (PK). Importantly, developed compounds demonstrate complete selectivity bacterial enzyme compared human orthologues. lead 91nM inhibitor IS-130 identified ligand-based cheminformatic exploration chemical space around micromolar hits initially generated experimental screening. following crystallographic study resulted identification tetrameric MRSA PK structure IS-130 bound interface protein's subunits. newly described binding pocket present otherwise highly similar human orthologues effectively utilized selective inhibition bacterial PK. following synthetic modifications IS-130, guided structure-based molecular modeling, resulted development MRSA PK inhibitors much improved antimicrobial properties. Considering notable lack recent reports novel antibacterial targets cognate antibacterial compounds, study provides valuable perspective development new generation antimicrobials. Equally noteworthy, results current work highlight importance rigorous cheminformatics-based exploration results high-throughput experiments.
