 Hepatic steatosis associated increased insulin resistance tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux, decreased ketogenesis pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) flux. study examined whether hepatic PDC activation inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2) ameliorates metabolic abnormalities. Wild-type mice fed high-fat diet exhibited hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, increased levels pyruvate, TCA cycle intermediates, malonyl-CoA reduced ketogenesis PDC activity due PDK2 induction. Hepatic PDC activation PDK2 inhibition attenuated hepatic steatosis, improved hepatic insulin sensitivity, reduced hepatic glucose production, increased capacity beta-oxidation ketogenesis, decreased capacity lipogenesis. results attributed altered enzymatic capacities reduction TCA anaplerosis limited availability oxaloacetate TCA cycle, promoted ketogenesis. current study reports increasing hepatic PDC activity inhibition PDK2 ameliorates hepatic steatosis insulin sensitivity regulating TCA cycle anaplerosis ketogenesis. findings suggest PDK2 potential therapeutic target nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
