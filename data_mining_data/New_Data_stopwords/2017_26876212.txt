 Head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients poor prognosis, invasion metastasis major causes mortality. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates wide range cellular processes crucial tumorigenesis, PIK3CA amplification mutation among common genetic alterations human HNSCC. Compared well-documented roles PI3K pathway cell growth survival, roles PI3K pathway tumor invasion metastasis well delineated. generated PIK3CA genetically engineered mouse model (PIK3CA-GEMM) wild-type PIK3CA overexpressed head neck epithelium. Although PIK3CA overexpression alone sufficient initiate HNSCC formation, significantly increased tumor susceptibility oral carcinogenesis mouse model. PIK3CA overexpression mouse oral epithelium increased tumor invasiveness metastasis increasing epithelial-mesenchymal transition enriching cancer stem cell phenotype tumor epithelial cells. addition epithelial alterations, also observed marked inflammation tumor stroma. AKT central signaling mediator PI3K pathway. However, molecular analysis suggested progression PIK3CA-driven HNSCC facilitated 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1) enhanced transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling rather AKT. Examination human HNSCC clinical samples revealed PIK3CA PDK1 protein levels correlated tumor progression, highlighting significance pathway. summary, results offer significant insight PIK3CA overexpression drives HNSCC invasion metastasis, providing rationale targeting PI3K/PDK1 TGFbeta signaling advanced HNSCC patients PIK3CA amplification.
