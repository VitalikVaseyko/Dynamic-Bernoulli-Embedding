 worldwide rates obesity type-II diabetes increasing, essential identify understand mechanisms involved nutrient absorption fuel allocation. Recent studies demonstrate nutrients (e.g., lipids carbohydrates) play major regulatory role gene transcription glycolytic lipogenic enzymes addition hormones, including insulin glucagon. nutrients generally exert effects key cellular nutrient/energy receptors. Fasting used identify nutrient/energy receptors known mammalian studies ascertain zebrafish (Danio rerio) suitable model study metabolic disorders. Zebrafish subjected fasting/re-feeding regime 3 weeks, gene expression sterol responsive binding protein 1 2 (SREBP), mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), cAMP response element binding protein 3-like 3 (CREB3l3), AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha) assessed. Fasted zebrafish lost approximately 10% body mass 3-week experiment, associated depression oxygen consumption. Increases liver AMPKalpha CREB3l3 mRNA transcript level noted, concurrent increases activities beta-oxidation gluconeogenic markers beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, respectively. Conversely, depression liver mTOR SREBP1 2 expression noted, decrease pyruvate kinase alanine aminotransferase activities decreases liver lipid glycogen contents. Twenty-four hours re-feeding, zebrafish rapidly recover, majority parameters return control values. Taken together, data suggest adult zebrafish appropriate model study human metabolic disorders.
