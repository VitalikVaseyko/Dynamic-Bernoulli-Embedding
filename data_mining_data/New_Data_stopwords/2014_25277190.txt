 tumor microenvironment plays important role cancer progression. Here, focused role reactive mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) osteosarcoma (OS), used human adipose MSC panel OS cell lines (Saos-2, HOS, 143B) investigate mutual effect normal-cancer cell metabolic programming. results showed MSC driven oxidative stress induced OS cells undergo Warburg metabolism, increased lactate production. Therefore, analyzed expression lactate monocarboxylate transporters. real time PCR immunofluorescence, MSC detected expression MCT-4, transporter lactate efflux, whereas MCT-1, responsible lactate uptake, expressed OS cells. agreement, silencing MCT-1 siRNA significantly affected ATP production OS cancer cells. Thus, cancer cells directly increase mitochondrial biogenesis using energy-rich metabolite abundantly provided MSC effect altered microenvironmental conditions induced OS cells. also showed lactate produced MSC promotes migratory ability OS cells. data provide novel information exploited cancer therapies targeting mutual metabolic reprogramming cancer cells stroma.
