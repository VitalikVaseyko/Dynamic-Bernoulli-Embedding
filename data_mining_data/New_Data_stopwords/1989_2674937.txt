 genomic sequencing procedure applied direct sequencing uncharacterized regions bacterial DNA "multiplex walking" approach. Samples bulk Escherichia coli DNA cut various restriction enzymes, subjected chemical sequencing degradations, run sequencing gel, transferred nylon membranes. labeled oligomer hybridized membrane, sequence ladder appears wherever probe lies near restriction cut. New probes, based sequence lies beyond restriction sites, synthesized, membranes reprobed reveal new sequence. Repeated cycles oligomer probe synthesis subsequent reprobing permit rapid sequence walking along genome. oligomer walking technique used sequence pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) gene E. coli without resorting cloning library construction. sequenced region amplified polymerase chain reaction subsequently transcribed translated using vivo vitro systems, resultant gene product characterized show gene encodes type isoform pyruvate kinase.
