 tested hypothesis hypoxia decreases PPARalpha-regulated gene expression heart muscle vivo. two rat models systemic hypoxia (cobalt chloride treatment iso-volemic hemodilution), transcript levels PPARalpha PPARalpha-regulated genes (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (mCPT-I), malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD)) measured using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Data normalized housekeeping gene beta-actin. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2), regulated PPARalpha, served controls. CoCl(2) treatment decreased PPARalpha, PDK4, mCPT-I, MCD mRNA levels. Iso-volemic anemia also caused significant decrease PPARalpha, PDK4, MCD mRNA levels. Transcript levels mCPT-I showed slight, significant decrease (P = 0.08). Gene expression beta-actin, ANF, PDK2 change either CoCl(2) treatment anemia. Myocardial PPARalpha-regulated gene expression decreased two models hypoxia vivo. results suggest transcriptional mechanism decreased fatty oxidation increased reliance heart glucose hypoxia.
