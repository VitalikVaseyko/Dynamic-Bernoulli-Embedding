 OBJECTIVE: evaluate potential tumor marker RCC. Tumor formation generally linked expansion glycolytic phosphometabolite pools aerobic glycolyticflux rates. achieve this, tumor cells generally overexpress special glycolytic isoenzyme, termed pyruvate kinase type M2. establish expansion phosphometabolite pools pyruvate kinase switches tetrameric form high phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) affinity dimeric form lower PEP affinity. dimeric form predominant tumors investigated termed TuM2Pk. MATERIALS METHODS: studied: a) expression TuM2Pk RCC immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibody recognizing mono- dimeric form pyruvate kinase, b) stability TuM2Pk serum measuring TuM2Pk 3 patients different times taking blood two-site immunometric assay, c) circadiane rhythm TuM2Pk blood measuring levels every 4 hours 5 patients, d) TuM2Pk- expression serum (see 2.) 5 patients taking blood tumor-side vena renalis compared peripherally blood, e) TuM2Pk (see point 2.) 40 RCC-patients comparing results 39 healthy persons clinical data RCC, f) influence wound healing TuM2Pk measuring serum-levels period 12 weeks 6 patients, g) individual follow 4 patients RCC stage Robson III 2 years. Comparing TuM2Pk-levels findings staging computed tomography. RESULTS: isoenzyme TuM2Pk could demonstrated RCC metastases immunohistochemistry monoclonal antibody specific pyruvate kinase type M2. normal kidney cells pyruvate kinase type M2 detectable. stability TuM2Pk studied serum within 30 minutes. circadian rhythm found. serum TuM2Pk comes tumor. Serum evaluation 39 healthy persons used determine normal values, upper concentration 28 U/ml TuM2Pk (95% percentile normal healthy persons). Serum evaluation 40 RCC showed significant difference healthy persons positive correlation Robson stage grading correlation TuM2Pk found histopathological cell type tumor diameter. radical nephrectomy normalization TuM2Pk level found within 11 weeks localized RCC. Continuously elevated serum levels seen metastatic RCC. Individual follow-up seems possible. CONCLUSION: Initial discrimination possible localized metastasized RCC using TuM2PK; however, possible differentiate benign malignant renal processes; specificity circumstances 75%. successful surgery localized RCC, elevated TuM2Pk normalized within 11 weeks, remain elevated increase case RCC-relapse metastasis. Thus TuM2Pk would appear useful marker RCC detection follow-up.
