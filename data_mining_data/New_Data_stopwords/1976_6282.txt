 Yeast hexokinase A(ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase) inactivated incubated presence xylose ATPMg, presence D-lyxose reaction medium ATPMg continuously regenerated (phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase). inactivation due phorphorylation protein. linear relationship observed inactivation incorporation 32P [gamma-32P] ATP. hexokinase ATPase activity enzyme lost one phosphoryl group incorporated per enzyme subunit (molecular weight 51,000). phosphoryl group covalently bound ester linkage serine residue protein.
