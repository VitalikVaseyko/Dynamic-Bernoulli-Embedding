 photo-electrochemical sensor specific detection guanosine monophosphate (GMP) demonstrated, based three enzymes combined coupled reaction assay. first reaction involves adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent conversion GMP guanosine diphosphate (GDP) guanylate kinase, warrants substrate specificity. reaction products ADP GDPare co-substrates enzymatic conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate second reaction mediated pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate turn co-substrate lactate dehydrogenase generates lactate via oxidation nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) NADH NAD(+). third enzymatic reaction electrochemically detected. purpose CdS/ZnS quantum dot (QD) electrode illuminated photocurrent response fixed potential conditions evaluated. sequential enzyme reactions first evaluated solution. Subsequently, sensor GMP constructed using polyelectrolytes enzyme immobilization.
