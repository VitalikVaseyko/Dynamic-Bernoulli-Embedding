 metabolic pathways glycogen utilized fetal tissues well established. present study ontogeny seven key enzymes involved glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle established rabbit fetal lung, heart, liver. fetal lung activities phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase increase day 21 25. Thereafter levels either drop day 19 levels change. isocitrate dehydrogenase activity continues increase day 19 gestation maximum level day 31 gestation. fetal heart pattern activity similar, fetal liver enzymes reach maximum levels earlier and, exception pyruvate kinase, show significant fall activity near term. pattern development pyruvate dehydrogenase complex different; maximum activity observed day 27 fetal lung heart day 21 fetal liver. results indicate three fetal tissues oxidize glucose. Also, accumulation glycogen, particularly fetal lung, appears ensure specific times gestation adequate quantities energy (ATP) substrates, required surfactant phospholipid synthesis, available independent maternal supply glucose brief episodes hypoxia.
