 Growth hormone (GH) counter-regulatory hormone plays important role preventing hypoglycemia fasting. inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) conserves substrates gluconeogenesis, tested whether GH increases PDK4 expression liver signaling pathway sensitive inhibition metformin. effects GH metformin determined liver wild-type, small heterodimer partner (SHP)-, PDK4-, signal transducer activator transcription 5 (STAT5)-null mice. Administration GH vivo increased PDK4 expression via pathway dependent STAT5 phosphorylation. Metformin inhibited induction PDK4 expression GH via pathway dependent AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) SHP induction. increase PDK4 expression PDC phosphorylation GH reduced STAT5-null mice. Metformin decreased GH-mediated induction PDK4 expression metabolites wild-type SHP-null mice. primary hepatocytes, dominant-negative mutant-AMPK SHP knockdown prevented inhibitory effect metformin GH-stimulated PDK4 expression. SHP directly inhibited STAT5 association PDK4 gene promoter. Metformin inhibits GH-induced PDK4 expression metabolites via AMPK-SHP-dependent pathway. metformin-AMPK-SHP network may provide novel therapeutic approach treatment hepatic metabolic disorders induced GH-mediated pathway.
