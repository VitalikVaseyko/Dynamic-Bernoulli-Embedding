 Hyperglycaemia well known adverse effect therapy diuretics. adipose tissue, hydrochlorothiazide furosemide inhibit rate glucose transport. skeletal muscle, furosemide decreases rate glucose phosphorylation glycolysis. However, whether furosemide direct effect activities glycolytic enzymes known. present study, effects furosemide activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase examined. Pieces skeletal muscle (quadriceps) liver obtained 10 non-diabetic subjects surgery. Tissues homogenized activities enzymes measured presence absence furosemide (0-1.5 mM). Furosemide inhibited activity three key glycolytic enzymes. concentration furosemide required inhibit phosphofructokinase muscle lower required inhibit activity enzyme liver inhibit activities hexokinase pyruvate kinase muscle liver. direct effects furosemide may contribute decrease glucose utilisation following therapy similar agents man.
