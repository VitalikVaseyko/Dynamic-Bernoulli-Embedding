 Resveratrol found fruits, vegetables beverages red wine, extensively evaluated anticardiovascular disease cancer preventive effects. Even though studies demonstrated anti-tumor effects, still clear explanation cancer cell selective mechanisms action resveratrol. Initial investigations focused anti-oxidant cytoprotective mechanism action, yet, large number studies demonstrated resveratrol behave either anti-oxidant pro-oxidant depending selective microenvironment. makes resveratrol protective agent normal cells radical generator possessing cytotoxic activity cancer cells widely debated topic. must certain conditions found tumors allow resveratrol become pro-oxidant clearly differs found normal cells. Results studies group established many different dietary agents mobilize intracellular copper ions process, generate reactive oxygen species Fenton type reactions leading oxidative DNA breakage consequently, cell death. significantly, demonstrated pro-oxidant-induced DNA damage apoptotic activity enhanced low pH environments; characteristically observed tumors due preferential dependence glycolysis "Warburg effect". review discusses recent advancements understanding pro-oxidant anti-cancer behavior resveratrol dietary chemopreventive agent, explained light Warburg effect.
