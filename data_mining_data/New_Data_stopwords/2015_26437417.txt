 Continuous energy supply, necessary condition life, excites state far thermodynamic equilibrium, particular coherent electric polar vibrations depending water ordering cell. Disturbances oxidative metabolism coherence central issue cancer development. Oxidative metabolism may impaired decreased pyruvate transfer mitochondrial matrix, either parasitic consumption and/or mitochondrial dysfunction. turn lead disturbance water molecules' ordering, diminished power, coherence electromagnetic field. tumors Warburg (reverse Warburg) effect, mitochondrial dysfunction affects cancer cells (fibroblasts associated cancer cells), electromagnetic field generated microtubules cancer cells low power (high power due transport energy-rich metabolites fibroblasts), disturbed coherence, shifted frequency spectrum according changed power. Therapeutic strategies restoring mitochondrial function may trigger apoptosis treated cells; yet, step performed, induction (inhibition) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (phosphatases) may restore cancer state. tumor tissues reverse Warburg effect, Caveolin-1 levels restored transport energy-rich metabolites interrupted cancer cells. cancer phenotypes, achieving permanently reversed mitochondrial dysfunction metabolic-modulating drugs may effective, specific anti-cancer strategy.
