 Ion filtration chromatography diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 used separate two isozymes triose phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerate 3-phosphate kinase, enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase homogenates developing castor oil (Ricinus communis L. cv. Baker 296) seeds. Crude plastid fractions, prepared differential centrifugation, enriched one isozymes, whereas cytosolic fractions enriched other. data (and data published previously) indicate plastids developing castor oil seeds complete glycolytic pathway capable conversion hexose phosphate pyruvate fatty acid synthesis. enzymes pathway plastids isozymes corresponding enzymes located cytosol.
