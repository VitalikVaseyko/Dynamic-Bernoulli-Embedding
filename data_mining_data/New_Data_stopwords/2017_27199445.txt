 OBJECTIVE: Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins modify histone nonhistone proteins thereby controlling cellular functions. However, role JmjC proteins angiogenesis largely unknown. Here, characterize expression JmjC domain-containing proteins inducing endothelial differentiation murine embryonic stem cells study function JmjC domain-only proteins endothelial cell (EC) functions. APPROACH RESULTS: identified large number JmjC domain-containing proteins regulated endothelial differentiation murine embryonic stem cells. Among family JmjC domain-only proteins, Jmjd8 significantly upregulated endothelial differentiation. Knockdown Jmjd8 ECs significantly decreased vitro network formation sprouting spheroid assay. JMJD8 exclusively detectable cytoplasm, excluding function histone-modifying enzyme. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed JMJD8-interacting proteins known functions cellular metabolism like pyruvate kinase M2. Accordingly, knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 human umbilical vein ECs decreased endothelial sprouting spheroid assay. Knockdown JMJD8 caused reduction EC metabolism measured Seahorse Bioscience extracellular flux analysis. Conversely, overexpression JMJD8 enhanced cellular oxygen consumption rate ECs, reflecting increased mitochondrial respiration. CONCLUSIONS: Jmjd8 upregulated endothelial differentiation regulates endothelial sprouting metabolism interacting pyruvate kinase M2.
