 potential role mitochondrial genome recently attracted interest high mutation frequency tumors. Different aspects mtDNA make relevant cancer's biology, encodes limited essential number genes OXPHOS biogenesis, particularly susceptible mutations, copy number vary. Moreover, ROS mitochondria produced electron transport chain. characteristics place mtDNA center multiple signaling pathways, known mitochondrial retrograde signaling, modifies numerous key processes cancer. Cybrid studies support mtDNA mutations relevant exert effect modification OXPHOS function ROS production. However, still much controversy regarding clinical relevance mtDNA mutations. New studies focus OXPHOS dysfunction associated specific mutational signature rather presence mutations mtDNA.
