 Cancer stem cells known influence survival, chemoresistance, relapse metastasis. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) maintains aerobic glycolysis cancer cells stimulates cell proliferation controlling Warburg effect. addition, PKM2 translocates nucleus up-regulates PDK1 expression controlling transcription. PKM2 confers malignant potential controlling metabolism transcriptional regulation. Tumor invasion initiated change epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cancer cell. EMT induction, parallel E-cadherin down-regulation vimentin up-regulation, expression PKM2 increased transcriptional translational level PKM2 translocated nucleus. TGIF2 identified interacted PKM2 nucleus response EMT induction, considered key role controlling EMT induction. performed immunohistochemical staining specific antibody PKM2 using clinical samples colorectal cancers. Clinicopathological analysis showed PKM2 positivity significantly correlated lymph node metastasis distant organ metastasis. conclusion, data suggested PKM2 nuclear function crucial role controlling invasion metastasis.
