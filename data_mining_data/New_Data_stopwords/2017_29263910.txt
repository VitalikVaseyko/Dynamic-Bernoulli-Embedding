 Targeting common weaknesses cancer important strategy cancer therapy. Glucose nutrient maintains essential cellular metabolism, supporting cancer cell survival, growth proliferation. Depriving glucose rapidly kills cancer cells. cancer cells possess feature called Warburg effect, refers cancer cells even ample oxygen exhibit exceptionally high glycolysis rate convert incoming glucose lactate. Although recognized Warburg effect confers growth advantage cancer cells glucose supply sufficient, feature could considered fatal weakness cancer cells glucose supply problem. glucose supply many solid tumors poor, cancer cells exceptionally high glycolytic capacity, maximizing cancer cell glycolysis rate would possibly exhaust intratumoral glucose, leading cancer cell death. Lactate proton two common factors solid tumors, jointly protect cancer cells glucose deprivation, also powerful regulators dictating glucose metabolic phenotypes cancer cells. Disrupting joint action lactate proton, example, means bicarbonate infusion tumor, could maximize cancer cell glycolytic rate rapidly use glucose, expose vulnerability glucose deprivation ultimately kill cancer cells. pilot clinical study demonstrated approach achieved remarkable improvement local control large huge hepatocellular carcinoma.
