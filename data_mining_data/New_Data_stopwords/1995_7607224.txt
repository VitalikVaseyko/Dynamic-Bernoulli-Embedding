 conformation MgATP bound active site Salmonella typhimurium 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate synthetase (PRibPP synthetase) investigated two-dimensional transferred-NOE spectroscopy (TRNOESY). Inter-proton NOEs ligand measured presence protein several mixing times range 40-300 ms 500 MHz 10 degrees C. Measurements made low ligand concentrations (approximately 1 mM) order avoid weak non-specific ligand-protein interactions ensure NOE arises ligand bound active site. inter-proton distances determined experimentally observed NOE buildup curves comparing theoretical simulations obtained using complete relaxation matrix. distances used constraints molecular modeling energy minimization calculations deduce structure bound ligand. PRibPP synthetase known appreciably aggregate exists multiple oligomeric forms solution. structure determined assumption ligand assumes conformation subunit every oligomer regardless size. basis rotational correlation time deduced enzyme-nucleotide complexes, estimated average oligomer PRibPP synthetase, sample used TRNOESY measurements, consists 30 subunits, whereas smallest active form protein pentamer. conformation enzyme-bound MgATP described glycosidic torsion angle chi = 50 +/- 5 degrees phase angle pseudorotation P = 114.9 degrees corresponding 1T degree sugar pucker. noteworthy value glycosidic torsion angle obtained pyrophosphoryl transfer enzyme complex agrees well obtained previously MgATP complexes creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase (active ancillary sites), arginine kinase. sugar pucker, hand, differs one enzyme complex another.
