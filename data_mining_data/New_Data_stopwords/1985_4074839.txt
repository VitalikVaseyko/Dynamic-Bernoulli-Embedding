 quantitative analysis mobile high-energy phosphorus metabolites isovolumic Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts performed 31P NMR utilizing rapid pulse repetition optimize sensitivity. Absolute quantification required reference external standard, determination differential magnetization saturation resonance peak area integration Lorentzian lineshape analysis. Traditionally accepted hemodynamic indices (LVDP, dp/dt) biochemical indices (lactate, pyruvate) myocardial function measured concomitantly NMR determinations. Hemodynamically biochemically competent Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts found intracellular PCr, ATP, GPC, Pi concentrations 14.95 +/- 0.25, 8.08 +/- 0.13, 5.20 +/- 0.58 2.61 +/- 0.47 mM respectively. Intracellular pH 7.03 +/- 0.01. Cytosolic ADP concentration derived creatine kinase equilibrium model determined approximately 36 microM. Reduction perfusate flow 20 2.5 ml/min demonstrated statistically significant decreases PCr, ATP, pH well increase Pi correlated closely independent hemodynamic biochemical indices myocardial function. decrease ATP PCr concentrations precisely matched increase Pi reduced flow. results constitute first quantitative determination intracellular metabolite concentrations 31P NMR intact rabbit myocardium physiologic low flow conditions.
