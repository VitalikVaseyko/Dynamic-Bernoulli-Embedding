 Hydroxytyrosol, important polyphenolic compound found olive oil, shown anti-tumor activity vitro vivo. However, effects hydroxytyrosol prostate cancer largely unkown. found hydroxytyrosol preferentially reduces viability human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU145) compared immortalized non-malignant prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1). Exposure PC-3 cells 80 micromol/L hydroxytyrosol resulted significant increases superoxide production activation apoptosis. increases accompanied mitochondrial dysfunction, defects autophagy, activation MAP kinases. Moreover, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, able reverse hydroxytyrosol-induced effects cell viability loss, defects autophagy, activation apoptosis. evidence suggests ROS play vital role loss PC-3 cell viability. However, MAPK inhibitors including U0126 (for Erk1/2), SB203580 (for p38MAPK) SP600125 (for JNK) decrease hydroxytyrosol-induced growth inhibition, suggesting kinases may required growth inhibitory effect hydroxytyrosol. Moreover, addition ROS scavengers (i.e. NAC, catalase, pyruvate, SOD) growth media prevent hydroxytyrosol induced cell viability loss, suggesting extracellular ROS (superoxide hydrogen peroxide) facilitate anti-proliferation effect hydroxytyrosol prostate cancer cells. present work firstly shows hydroxytyrosol induces apoptotic cell death mitochondrial dysfunction generating superoxide PC-3 cells. research presents preliminary evidence vitro chemopreventive effect hydroxytyrosol, contribute investigation hydroxytyrosol anti-cancer agent.
