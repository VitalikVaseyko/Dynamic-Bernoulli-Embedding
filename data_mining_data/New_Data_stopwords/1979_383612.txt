 Cell-free extracts Treponema pallidum catalyzed decarboxylation pyruvate. activity suppressed low O2 tensions appeared coenzyme independent. Pyruvate decarboxylation inorganic phosphate dependent, evidence suggested acetyl phosphate product. Oxygen consumed, data indicated H2O2 produced. results indicated overall oxidation pyruvate was: pyruvate + O2 + inorganic phosphate leads CO2 + acetyl phosphate + H2O2. Phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase activities also observed cell-free extracts could catalyze formation acetyl coenzyme adenosine 5'-triphosphate, respectively, acetyl phosphate.
