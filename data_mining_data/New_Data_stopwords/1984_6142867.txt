 Metabolic alterations ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)-lesioned rats investigated examining daily changes enzyme activities urea concentrations three weeks operation. VMH-lesions female adult rats caused significant elevation activity acetyl-CoA carboxylase liver parametrial adipose tissue. changes suggest increased lipogenesis. VMH-lesions also elicited increase activities glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK) fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), decrease activities phosphofructokinase (PFK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) liver. apparently inconsistent changes activities key glycolytic enzymes, GK, PK PFK, key gluconeogenic enzymes, G6Pase, PEPCK FBPase liver may explained fact favorable glucose oxidation pentose phosphate cycle provide NADPH lipogenesis liver. Furthermore, VMH-lesions induced increase urea contents liver serum, elicited increase activity liver tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) decrease activity liver histidase. changes suggest accelerated amino acid protein catabolism, favor increment supply substrate lipogenesis. Daily rhythms TAT, histidase activities serum urea concentration observed control rats abolished VMH-lesions. findings suggest VMH-lesions elicit loss daily rhythms, probably disturbance circadian rhythm feeding behavior dynamic phase (three weeks operation) obesity.
