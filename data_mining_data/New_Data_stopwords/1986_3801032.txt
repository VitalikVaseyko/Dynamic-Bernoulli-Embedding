 order provide information relative binding characteristics glycolytic enzymes, effect fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) release glycolytic enzymes cultured pig kidney cells treated digitonin studied. absence FBP, differential release enzymes observed, order retention aldolase greater glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase greater glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerokinase, phosphoglucomutase, lactate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase. presence fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, release aldolase considerably enhanced, whereas release phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase decreased metabolite. significant alterations rate release enzymes caused FBP. data discussed relation contribution knowledge degree association order binding glycolytic enzymes cytoplasmic matrix.
