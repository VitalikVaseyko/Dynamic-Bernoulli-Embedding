 Changes enzyme conformation often accompanied large changes volume. Model compound studies suggest volume changes may derive two sources: (i) "hydration density" effects due changes exposure solvent protein groups modify water density, (ii) "structural" contributions arising changes volume protein itself. experimental approach developed test validity predictions based model compound studies catalytic conformational changes. examining effects different solutes activation volumes different enzymic reactions, show sources volume change provide significant contributions activation volume.
