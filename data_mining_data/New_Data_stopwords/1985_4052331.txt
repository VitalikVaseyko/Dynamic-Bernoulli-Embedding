 age dependent behaviour 11, mainly glycolytic, red blood cell enzymes 26 patients various haematological disorders investigated separation red blood cells discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. frequency enzyme deficiencies old cells patients significantly increased comparison unseparated cells, 29 13 deficiencies, respectively. Particularly hexokinase activity, although normal even increased unseparated cells, found deficient old cells seven cases. addition, increased number phosphofructokinase deficiencies observed patients' old cells (eight cases) compared unseparated cells (three cases). However, red blood cells majority patients found contain increased enzyme activities, irrespective cell age. Enzyme activities youngest cell population correlate reticulocyte count. Cases high pyruvate kinase hexokinase activities studied kinetical, electrophoretical immunological properties respective enzymes, abnormalities could demonstrated, indicating increased synthesis enzymes.
