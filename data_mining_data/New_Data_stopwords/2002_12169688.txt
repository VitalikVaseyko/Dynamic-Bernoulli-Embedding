 Transcription mitochondrial serine:pyruvate aminotransferase (SPT) mRNA (SPTm-mRNA) rat liver unique occurs upstream site two transcription start sites within first exon SPT gene selectively enhanced cAMP via protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway. study, identified DNA elements nuclear factors responsible basal PKA-induced activities upstream promoter. using luciferase reporter assay HepG2 cells, DNase footprinting analysis, gel shift experiments, identified binding sites Sp1 AP-2 within regions -125 -89 -14 +10, respectively. Mutational analyses indicated regions essential transcription factor binding SPT promoter activity. Expression AP-2 caused marked increase basal promoter activity level achieved PKA. hand, basal PKA-induced activities elevated overexpression Sp1, effect PKA-induced activity pronounced coexpression CBP repressed E1A oncoprotein. results suggest AP-2 Sp1 regulate basal promoter activity, Sp1 also involved PKA-mediated expression rat SPT gene concert transcriptional coactivator CBP.
