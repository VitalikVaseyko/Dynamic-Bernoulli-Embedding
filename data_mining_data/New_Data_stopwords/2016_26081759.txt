 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key protein responsible cancer's Warburg effect. Activation PKM2 may alter aberrant metabolism cancer cells, suggests PKM2 tumor selective therapeutic target. paper, lead compound 8 first discovered new kind PKM2 activator random screening in-house compound library. Then, series lead compound 8 analogs designed, synthesized evaluated activation PKM2 anticancer activities. 7-Azaindole analog 32 identified potent PKM2 activator. Compounds potent enzyme activity also exhibited selective anti-proliferation activity cancer cell lines HCT116, Hela H1299 compared non-tumor cell line BEAS-2B. structure-activity relationships compounds supported molecular docking results. Preliminary pharmacological studies also showed compound 32 arrests cell cycle G2/M phase HCT116 cell line.
