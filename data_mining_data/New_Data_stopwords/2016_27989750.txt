 Several evidence indicate metabolic alterations play pivotal role cancer development. Here, report mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) sustains metabolic shift mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) glycolysis pancreas cancer cells. Indeed, show UCP2 sensitizes pancreas cancer cells treatment glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose. bidimensional electrophoresis analysis, identify 19 protein species differentially expressed treatment UCP2 inhibitor genipin and, bioinformatic analyses, show proteins mainly involved metabolic processes. particular, demonstrate antioxidant UCP2 induces expression hnRNPA2/B1, involved regulation GLUT1 PKM2 mRNAs, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increasing secretion L-lactic acid. demonstrate radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine reverts hnRNPA2/B1 PKM2 inhibition genipin indicating role reactive oxygen species metabolic reprogramming cancer cells mediated UCP2. also observe UCP2-dependent decrease mtOXPHOS complex (NADH dehydrogenase), complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), complex V (ATPase) mitochondrial oxygen consumption, suggesting role UCP2 counteraction pancreatic cancer cellular respiration. results reveal novel mechanisms UCP2 promotes cancer cell proliferation concomitant metabolic shift mtOXPHOS glycolytic pathway.
