 Thymocyte development requires integration extracellular cues enforce lineage commitment multiple defined checkpoints stage-specific manner. Critical signals pre-TCR, Notch, receptor interleukin-7 (IL-7) dictate cellular differentiation CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative) stage CD4+CD8+ (double positive) stage. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway required translate extracellular signaling events multiple functional outcomes including cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation, allelic exclusion beta-selection checkpoint. However, complete understanding contributions made PI3K/Akt pathway thymocyte development straightforward. review highlights studies support model PI3K/Akt pathway essential thymocyte survival. provide new evidence Akt-mediated survival solely due increased expression Bcl-xL also consequence role played Akt support metabolism proliferating thymocytes.
