 Glycolysis initial step glucose catabolism up-regulated cancer cells (the Warburg Effect). shifts toward glycolytic phenotype explored widely biological systems, molecular mechanisms underlying shifts remain unknown. proteomics, observed increased glycolysis disused human diaphragm muscle. disused muscle, lung cancer, H(2)O(2)-treated myotubes, show up-regulation rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme muscle-type phosphofructokinase (PFKm, >2 fold, P<0.05) accumulation lactate (>150%, P<0.05). Using microRNA profiling, identify miR-320a regulator PFKm expression. Reduced miR-320a levels (to approximately 50% control, P<0.05) associated increased PFKm diverse systems. Manipulation miR-320a levels vitro vivo alters PFKm lactate levels expected directions. Further, miR-320a appears regulate oxidative stress-induced PFKm expression, reduced miR-320a allows greater induction glycolysis response H(2)O(2) treatment. show microRNA-mediated regulation occurs PFKm's 3' untranslated region Ets proteins involved regulation PFKm via miR-320a. findings suggest oxidative stress-responsive microRNA-320a may regulate glycolysis broadly within nature.
