 Cancers characterized increasing glycolytic activity, called Warburg effect. Although phenomenon well known, mechanism enhanced rate glycolysis cancer yet clearly recognized. present study investigated glycolytic rate, regulatory enzymatic activities expression phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) human breast cancer paracancer tissues. Human breast cancer tissues increased degree glycolytic efficiency regulatory enzymatic activities, shown previous studies. However, present study identified number novel observations. total PFK-1 levels higher human breast cancer tissues paracancer tissues, investigations revealed differential PFK-1 isoenzyme expression patterns human breast cancer paracancer tissues. human breast cancer paracancer tissues mainly expressed PFK-P PFK-L isoforms, respectively. Linear-regression analysis showed that, depending pathological stage breast cancer, expression PFK-P significantly positively correlated activity PFK-1. Thus, development human breast cancer, enhancement glycolytic activity depends primarily conversion PFK-1, PFK-L PFK-P.
