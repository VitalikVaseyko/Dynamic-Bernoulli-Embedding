 UNLABELLED: Seedlings Citrus sinensis fertilized boron (B)-deficient (0muM H3BO3) -sufficient (10muM H3BO3) nutrient solution 15weeks. Thereafter, iTRAQ analysis employed compare abundances proteins B-deficient -sufficient roots. B-deficient roots, 164 up-regulated 225 down-regulated proteins identified. proteins grouped following functional categories: protein metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, stress responses, carbohydrate energy metabolism, cell transport, cell wall cytoskeleton metabolism, biological regulation signal transduction, lipid metabolism. adaptive responses roots B-deficiency might include following several aspects: (a) decreasing root respiration; (b) improving total ability scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS); (c) enhancing cell transport. differentially expressed proteins identified iTRAQ much larger detected using 2D gel electrophoresis, many novel B-deficiency-responsive proteins involved cell transport, biological regulation signal transduction, stress responses metabolic processes identified work. results indicate remarkable metabolic flexibility citrus roots, may contribute survival B-deficient plants. represents comprehensive analysis protein profiles response B-deficiency. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: study, identified many new proteins involved cell transport, biological regulation signal transduction, stress responses metabolic processes previously known associated root B-deficiency responses. Therefore, manuscript represents comprehensive analysis protein profiles response B-deficiency provides new information plant response B-deficiency. article part Special Issue entitled: Translational Plant Proteomics.
