 investigated whether chronic vivo treatment peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonist Wy-14,643 attenuates cardiac contractile function impairing mitochondrial respiration. Wy-14,643 (25 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) administered Wistar rats oral gavage 14 consecutive days, ex vivo heart function, myocardial mitochondrial respiratory capacity, metabolic gene expression determined. Body heart weights significantly altered following 14 days Wy-14,643 administration. Heart perfusion studies showed significantly reduced systolic developed pressures, rate pressure product declined 36 +/- 2.6% (P < 0.01 vs. vehicle) 14 days Wy-14,643 treatment. State 3 mitochondrial respiration lower Wy-14,643 group (P = 0.06 vs. vehicle). State 4 respiration oligomycin-insensitive proton leak significantly increased compared matched controls. rate ADP phosphorylation also decreased 44.9 +/- 1.9% (P < 0.05 vs. vehicle). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) transcript levels upregulated, cytochrome oxidase II (COXII) expression decreased following Wy-14,643 treatment. study demonstrates chronic vivo Wy-14,643 administration impaired cardiac contractile function parallel decreased mitochondrial respiratory function increased uncoupling.
