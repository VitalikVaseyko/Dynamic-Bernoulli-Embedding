 Leptin, protein produced secreted adipocytes, know regulate food intake whole-body energy metabolism, knowledge possible effect bovine mammary gland scarce. Leptin may involved regulation glucose transport even though effect tissue level remains controversial. uptaken mammary gland, glucose utilised several ways majority, 60-70%, drained lactose synthesis. study aimed investigating effect leptin glucose regulation bovine mammary gland. examined effects leptin expression GLUT1 mRNA, pyruvate kinase (PK) well glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity. Treatment mammary gland explants recombinant leptin influence glucose assimilation, pathway transport (GLUT1 mRNA) glucose metabolism (PK G6PDH) tissue. results study seem exclude involvement leptin glucose uptake metabolism bovine mammary gland.
