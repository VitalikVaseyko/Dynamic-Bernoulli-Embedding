 Aging presumably initiates shifts substrate oxidation mediated part changes insulin sensitivity. Similar shifts occur cardiac hypertrophy may contribute contractile dysfunction. tested hypothesis aging modifies substrate utilization alters insulin sensitivity mouse heart provided multiple substrates. vivo cardiac function measured microtipped pressure transducers left ventricle control (4-6 mo) aged (22-24 mo) mice. Cardiac function also measured isolated working hearts along substrate anaplerotic fractional contributions citric acid cycle (CAC) using perfusate containing (13)C-labeled free fatty acids (FFA), acetoacetate, lactate, unlabeled glucose. Stroke volume cardiac output diminished aged mice vivo, pressure development preserved. Systolic diastolic functions maintained aged isolated hearts. Insulin prompted increase systolic function aged hearts, resulting increase cardiac efficiency. FFA ketone flux present markedly impaired aged hearts. changes myocardial substrate utilization corresponded alterations circulating lipids, thyroid hormone, reductions protein expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4. Insulin suppressed FFA oxidation aged. Insulin stimulation anaplerosis control hearts absent aged. aged heart shows metabolic plasticity accessing multiple substrates maintain function. However, fatty acid oxidation capacity limited. Impaired insulin-stimulated anaplerosis may contribute elevated cardiac efficiency, may also limit response acute stress depletion CAC intermediates.
