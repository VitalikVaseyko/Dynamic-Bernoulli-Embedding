 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase irreverisbly inactivated 5-chloro-4-oxopentanoic acid pKa 9.2. inhibition time-dependent related 5-chloro-4-oxopentanoic acid concentration. Analysis kinetics inhibition showed binding inhibitor showed positive co-operativity (n = 1.5 +/- 0.2). Inhibition pyruvate kinase 5-chloro-4-oxopentanoic acid prevented ligands bind active site. effectiveness placed order Mg2+ greater phosphoenolpyruvate greater ATP greater ADP greater pyruvate. Inhibitor-modified pyruvate kinase unable catalyse detritiation [3-(3)H]pyruvate ATP-promoted reaction, retain 5-10% activity either phosphate arsenate promoters. 5-Chlor-4-oxo-[3,5-(3)H]pentanoic acid covalently bound pyruvate kinase demonstrated stoicheiometry 1 mol inhibitor bound per mol pyruvate kinase protomer. incorporation inhibitor loss enzyme proportional. results discussed terms 5-chloro-4-oxopentanoic acid alkylating functional group phosphoryl overlap region active site, model presented compound alkylates active-site thiol reaction controlled basic group active site.
