 BACKGROUND: Warburg Effect metabolic switch occurs cancer cells advantages fully understood. switch known happen renal cell carcinoma (RCC), common solid cancer adult kidney. RCC carcinogenesis related pVHL loss Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) activation, ultimately leading activation several genes related glycolysis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptional level also deregulated several cancers, including RCC. SCOPE REVIEW: review focuses miRNAs direct target enzymes involved glycolysis deregulated several cancers. also reviews possible application miRNAs improvement clinical patients' management. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Several miRNAs direct target enzymes involved glycolysis downregulated cancer, strongly influencing Warburg Effect. Due strong influence, FDG-PET possibly benefit measurement miRNAs. Restoring levels also bring improvement current therapies. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Despite known almost hundred years, Warburg Effect fully understood. MiRNAs known intrinsically connected effect present opportunity understand it. also open new door improve current diagnosis prognosis tests well complement current therapies. urgent cancers like RCC, mostly due lack efficient screening test early relapse detection follow-up development resistance current therapies.
