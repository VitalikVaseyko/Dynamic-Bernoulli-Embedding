 transformation protochlorophyllide (PChle) chlorophyllide (Chle) studied isolated etioplasts Zea mays. ATP (1.5mm) prevented transformation photoconvertible PChle 650 PChle 630 aged etioplasts. Curve analysis indicated ATP effect photoconvertibility could entirely accounted changes proportions PChle 630 PChle 650 examination isolated pigments revealed unphytylated PChle could activated photoconversion ATP. etioplasts aged 5 hours, ATP also stimulated photoconversion PChle 630 Chle 670. process temperature-sensitive involved PChle 650 Chle 680 intermediates. AMP alone effect, inhibited ATP retardation PChle loss. ADP similar lesser effect ATP. ADP response, ATP response, considerably enhanced presence ATP-generating system (phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase). UTP, GTP, CTP gave 40 50% ATP response intact etioplasts. envelope-free etioplasts, ATP gave greatest response nucleotides 80% effective ATP. primary photoconversion, ATP stimulated resynthesis PChle 650. proposed ATP gives holochrome ability bind PChle molecule enables additional association pigment-protein complex form PChle 650.
