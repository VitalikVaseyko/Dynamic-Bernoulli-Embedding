 PII protein family widespread prokaryotes plants. study, impacts PII deficiency synthesis acetyl CoA acetyl CoA carboxylase enzyme (ACCase) analyzed Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 evaluating mRNA levels pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), citrate synthase (CS), biotin synthase (BS), biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), carboxyl transferase (CT) alpha beta subunits. PII deficient Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 showed upregulation above-mentioned genes, except CS. Analyses genes required acetyl coA synthesis exhibited substantial increase transcript levels PK PDH PII mutant strain. addition, PII mutant also displayed reduced acetyl CoA content, high ACCase activity, increased lipid content. lessening acetyl CoA content attributed rapid utilization acetyl CoA fatty acid synthesis well TCA cycle whereas increased ACCase activity ascribed rise mRNA levels BS, BC, BCCP, CT alpha, beta genes. However, increased lipid content correlated declined total protein content. Hence, study suggested PII protein regulates synthesis acetyl CoA ACCase enzyme transcriptional level.
