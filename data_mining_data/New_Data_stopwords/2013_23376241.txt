 Altered carbohydrate metabolism cancer cells first noted Otto Warburg 80 years ago. Upregulation genes controlling glycolytic pathway normoxia, known Warburg effect, clearly differentiates malignant non-malignant cells. resurgence interest cancer metabolism aims better understanding metabolic differences malignant non-malignant cells creation novel therapeutic diagnostic agents exploiting differences. Modified d-glucose d-mannose analogs shown interfere metabolism respective monosaccharide parent molecules potentially clinically useful anticancer diagnostic agents. One agent, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), extensively studied vitro vivo also clinically evaluated. Studies clearly indicate 2-DG pleiotropic mechanism action. addition effectively inhibiting glycolysis, 2-DG also shown affect protein glycosylation. order better understand molecular mechanism action, designed synthesized deuterated molecular probes study 2-DG interference d-glucose d-mannose metabolism using mass spectrometry. present synthesis desired probes: 2-deutero-d-glucose, 2-deutero-d-mannose, 6-deutero-d-glucose, 6-deutero-d-mannose, 2-deutero-2-deoxy-d-glucose well complete chemical characterization.
