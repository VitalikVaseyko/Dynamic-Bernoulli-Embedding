 Clostridium thermosulfurogenes displayed faster growth either glucose, maltose, starch Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum. species grew faster glucose starch maltose. fermentation end product ratios altered based higher ethanol lactate yields starch glucose. C. thermohydrosulfuricum, glucoamylase, pullulanase, maltase mainly responsible conversion starch maltose glucose, accumulated putative glucose permease. C. thermosulfurogenes, beta-amylase primarily responsible degradation starch maltose, accumulated putative maltose permease hydrolyzed glucoamylase. Regardless growth substrate, rates glucose, maltose, starch transformation higher C. thermosulfurogenes C. thermohydrosulfuricum. species functional Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway displayed following catabolic activities: ferredoxin-linked pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetate kinase, NAD(P)-ethanol dehydrogenase, NAD(P)-ferredoxin oxidoreductase, hydrogenase, fructose-1,6-diphosphate-activated lactate dehydrogenase. Ferredoxin-NAD reductase activity higher C. thermohydrosulfuricum NADH-ferredoxin oxidase activity, former activity detectable C. thermosulfurogenes. NAD- NADP-linked ethanol dehydrogenases unidirectional C. thermosulfurogenes reversible C. thermohydrosulfuricum. ratio hydrogen-producing hydrogenase hydrogen-consuming hydrogenase higher C. thermosulfurogenes. Two biochemical models proposed explain differential saccharide metabolism basis species enzyme differences relation specific growth substrates.
