 PURPOSE: Pyruvate, natural energy-yielding fuel myocardium, neutralizes peroxides direct decarboxylation reaction, indirectly augments glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system generating NADPH reducing power via citrate formation. possibility pyruvate's antioxidant actions could mediate enhancement contractile performance prooxidant-challenged myocardium investigated isolated working guinea-pig hearts reversibly injured hydrogen peroxide. METHODS: Hearts challenged 10 min perfusion 100 microM H(2)O(2), followed 90 min H(2)O(2)-free perfusion. Metabolic antioxidant treatments (each 5m M) administered 30-90 min post-H(2)O(2). Phosphocreatine phosphorylation state, GSH/glutathione disulfide redox potential (GSH/GSSG) key enzyme activities measured snap-frozen myocardium. RESULTS: H(2)O(2) exposure depleted myocardial energy antioxidant reserves produced marked contractile impairment persisted throughout H(2)O(2) washout period. Relative untreated post-H(2)O(2) myocardium, pyruvate restored contractile performance, increased GSH/GSSG 52% maintained phosphocreatine phosphorylation state; contrast, lactate lowered cardiac performance phosphorylation state. Neither pharmacological antioxidant N -acetylcysteine (NAC) pyruvate analog alpha-ketobutyrate increased cardiac function; treatments increased GSH/GSSG lowered phosphocreatine potential. H(2)O(2) partially inactivated aconitase, creatine kinase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), three enzymes spontaneously recovered H(2)O(2) washout. Pyruvate activate enzymes unexpectedly inhibited GAPDH 60-70%. CONCLUSION: Pyruvate promoted robust contractile recovery H(2)O(2)-challenged myocardium combination citrate-mediated antioxidant mechanisms maintenance myocardial energy reserves.
