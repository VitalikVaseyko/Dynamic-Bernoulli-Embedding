 BACKGROUND: Inflammation response oxidative stress promote occurrence development multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). METHODS: Eighty MODS rats third-degree burns divided randomly 4 groups: insulin, ethyl pyruvate (EP), insulin combined EP, control. Blood levels glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine (CRE), creatine kinase (CK), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) well 1, 3, 5, 7 days burns measured. RESULTS: Blood levels ALT, CRE, CK, TNF-alpha, HMGB-1, MDA INS, EP, INS+EP groups different time points significantly lower, TAC significantly higher control group (C) (P<.01). parameters INS+EP group significantly lower, TAC significantly higher INS EP groups (P<.01). Blood levels TNF-alpha, HMGB-1, TAC INS group different time points burns significantly lower, MDA significantly higher EP group (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin combined EP effectively reduce inflammatory response, oxidative stress, main organ dysfunctions MODS rats severe burns. therapeutic effect insulin combined EP superior single-agent treatment. insulin anti-inflammatory effect better pyruvic acid ethyl ester, ethyl pyruvate antioxidation effect better insulin. insulin treat inflammation, whereas EP reduce oxidative stress MODS rats.
