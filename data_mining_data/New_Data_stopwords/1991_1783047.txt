 cultured epithelial cells rat liver isoenzyme patterns pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase alkaline phosphatase studied compared freshly isolated parenchymal non-parenchymal liver cells. epithelial cell lines pyruvate kinase activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, suggesting absence L-isoenzyme. Cell lines derived livers newborn rats expressed LDH-4 -5, whereas cell lines developed fetal rat livers contained 5 lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes. latter case pattern found depend state confluence. cell lines exhibited single alkaline phosphatase form, however, differences found respect electrophoretic mobility.
