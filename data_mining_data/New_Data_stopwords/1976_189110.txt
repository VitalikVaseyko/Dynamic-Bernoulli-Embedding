 spite extensive studies glucose metabolism surgical field, postoperative renal hepatic glucose metabolism interrelation reported. present study undertaken interrelate metabolic states kidney liver total gastrectomized dogs. kidney, glycolysis inhibited early postoperative stage whereas gluconeogenesis activated. late postoperative stage glycolysis remained slightly inhibited, gluconeogenesis remained activated. liver, early postoperative stage glycolysis inhibited, whereas gluconeogenesis activated. glycolysis late postoperative stage returned preoperative stage, gluconeogenesis remained inhibited. gluconeogenesis kidney liver disturbed early postoperative stage restored, reversed, late postoperative stage.
