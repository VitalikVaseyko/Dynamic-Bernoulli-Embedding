 Several complementary studies undertaken single species deep-sea fish (the eel Synaphobranchus kaupii) within small temporal spatial range. situ experiments swimming foraging behaviour, muscle performance, metabolic rate performed Porcupine Seabight, northeast Atlantic, alongside measurements temperature current regime. Deep-water trawling used collect eels studies animal distribution anatomical biochemical analyses, including white muscle citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) activities. Synaphobranchus kaupii demonstrated whole-animal swimming speeds similar active deep-sea fish Antimora rostrata. Metabolic rates order magnitude higher (31.6 mL kg(-1) h(-1)) recorded deep-sea scavenging fish. Activities CS, LDH, MDH, PK higher expected, scaled negatively body mass, indicating general decrease muscle energy supply fish growth. Despite apparent constraint, observed situ burst routine swimming performances scaled similar fashion studied species. higher-than-expected metabolic rates activity levels, unusual scaling relationships aerobic anaerobic metabolism enzymes white muscle, probably reflect changes habitat feeding ecology experienced ontogeny bathyal species.
