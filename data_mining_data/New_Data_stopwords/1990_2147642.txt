 1. Phosphofructo 2-kinase chicken erythrocytes copurifies fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity, suggesting enzyme bifunctional. 2. Similarly phosphofructo 2-kinase tissues activated inorganic phosphate, inhibited phosphoenol pyruvate, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate citrate. However, characteristics different chicken liver phosphofructo 2-kinase, indicating distinct isozyme. 3. phosphofructo 2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity ratio erythrocyte enzyme one order magnitude higher enzyme liver. contrast chicken liver enzyme, phosphofructo 2-kinase chicken erythrocytes activated dithiothreitol activity increases pH. 4. Chicken erythrocyte phosphofructo 2-kinase activity neither modified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase casein kinase II. contrast, partially inhibited protein kinase C.
