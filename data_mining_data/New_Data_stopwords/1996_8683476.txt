 1. effects sodium salt weak acid lactate tension intracellular pH (pH1) studied rat mesenteric small arteries mounted wire myograph. Sodium lactate substituted iso-osmotically sodium chloride. 2. concentration 50 mM, L- D-stereoisomers lactate markedly relaxed arteries preconstricted noradrenaline (NA) within 10 min. concentration-response relationship L-lactate showed NA contracture relaxed 50% approximately 26 mM. L-Lactate not, however, relax arteries preconstricted high-K+(45 mM) solution. 3. L-Lactate alter extracellular pH (pHo) caused small significant decrease pH1, measured using pH-sensitive fluorochrome, 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Relaxation L-lactate unaffected change pHi offset simultaneous addition NH4Cl solution. 4. Sodium pyruvate (50 mM) caused significant intracellular acidosis relax arteries preconstricted NA. 5. L-Lactate-induced relaxations unaffected removal endothelium synthesis nitric oxide (NO) inhibited 10(-4) N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). 6. potassium channel blockers glibenclamide (10 microM), 4-aminopyridine (3 mM) tetraethylammonium chloride (10 mM) affect L-lactate-induced relaxation arteries preconstricted NA. Inhibition guanylate cyclase Methylene Blue, cyclooxgenase indomethacin, also affect relaxation L-lactate. 7. Rp stereoisomer adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Rp-cAMPS), analogue cAMP inhibits competitively stimulation protein kinase A, reduced significantly L-lactate-induced relaxation concentration 25 microM. Rp-cAMPS also significantly reduced forskolin-induced relaxation NA contracture. 8. concluded L-lactate-induced relaxation vascular bed pHi-1 endothelium-, nitric oxide-independent. mediated inhibition voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, opening K+ channels, prostacylin cyclic GMP. cAMP may however play role L-lactate-induced relaxation.
