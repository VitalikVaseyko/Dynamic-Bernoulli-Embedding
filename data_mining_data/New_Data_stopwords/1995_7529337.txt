 Previous work shown herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) regulatory protein ICP27 localizes cell nucleus certain mutant ICP27 polypeptides localize preferentially nucleoli. map signals ICP27 mediate nuclear localization, identified portions ICP27 direct cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase (PK), nuclei. results demonstrate ICP27 contains multiple nuclear localization signals (NLSs) function differing efficiencies. First, ICP27 possesses strong NLS, mapping residues 110 137, bears similarity bipartite NLSs found Xenopus laevis nucleoplasmin proteins. Second, ICP27 possesses one weak NLSs map carboxyl-terminal portion protein residues 140 512. PK-targeting experiments also demonstrate ICP27 contains relatively short sequence, mapping residues 110 152, function nucleolar localization signal (NuLS). signal includes ICP27's strong NLS well 15 contiguous residues consist entirely arginine glycine. latter sequence similar RGG box, putative RNA-binding motif found number cellular proteins involved nuclear RNA processing. confirm results PK-targeting experiments, mutated ICP27 gene deleting sequences encoding either strong NLS RGG box. Deletion strong NLS (residues 109 138) resulted ICP27 molecule partially defective nuclear localization, deletion RGG box (residues 139 153) resulted molecule nuclear localized excluded nucleoli. Recombinant HSV-1s bearing either deletions unable replicate efficiently Vero cells, suggesting ICP27's strong NLS RGG box carry important vivo functions.
