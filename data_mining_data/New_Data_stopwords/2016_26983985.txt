 Tumor hypoxia attracting increasing attention fields radiation biology oncology since Thomlinson Gray detected hypoxic cells malignant solid tumors showed exert negative impact outcome radiation therapy. unfavorable influence has, least partly, attributed cancer cells acquiring radioresistant phenotype activation transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). hand, accumulating evidence recently revealed that, even though HIF-1 recognized important regulator cellular adaptive responses hypoxia, may become active induce tumor radioresistance hypoxic conditions only. mechanisms HIF-1 activated cancer cells hypoxic conditions, also normoxic conditions, cancer-specific genetic alterations resultant imbalance intermediate metabolites summarized herein. relevance HIF-1-mediated characteristic features cancer cells, production antioxidants reprogramming glucose metabolic pathway cell cycle regulation, tumor radioresistance also reviewed.
