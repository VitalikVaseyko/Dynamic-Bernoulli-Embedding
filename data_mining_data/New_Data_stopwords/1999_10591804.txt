 PURPOSE: inactive form pyruvatekinase could established different tumours. Purpose study demonstrate presence absence inactive form pyruvatekinase renal cell carcinoma, metastases benign renal tissue immunohistology. METHOD: deparaffinization formaline-fixed tissue (5 original tumours, 2 metastases 5 benign renal tissues) cells stained (APAAP-method) Clon DF4 (ScheBo Tech). RESULTS: malign tissue showed positive reaction, inside benign tissue saw positive reaction endothelial cells however saw reaction benign renal cells. CONCLUSION: Renal cell carcinoma metastatic cells show strong immunohistological reaction inactive form pyruvatekinase, reaction benign renal cells. possible develop serological tumour marker renal cell carcinoma.
