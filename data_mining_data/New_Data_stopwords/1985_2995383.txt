 Atractyloside inhibited gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone hepatocytes fasted rats increased lactate synthesis. presence atractyloside, lactate/pyruvate beta-hydroxybutyrate/aceto-acetate ratios increased accumulation Fru-2,6-P2 prevented. absence atractyloside, gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone stimulated dibutyryl-cAMP and, much lesser extent, norepinephrine vasopressin. Omission Ca2+ increased stimulation norepinephrine prevented vasopressin. High concentrations (greater equal 40 microM) atractyloside abolished stimulation gluconeogenesis dibutyryl-cAMP norepinephrine vasopressin. Exogenous Ca2+ required hormonal stimulation presence atractyloside. stimulation norepinephrine inhibited ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N-tetraacetic acid prazosin propranolol. Atractyloside caused decreases glycolytic intermediates activation pyruvate kinase. Norepinephrine partially reversed effects. mitochondrial cytosolic ATP/ADP ratios determined digitonin fractionation hepatocytes. Norepinephrine vasopressin increased cytosolic ATP/ADP presence atractyloside. suggest increased availability cytosolic ATP could responsible stimulation gluconeogenesis hormones.
