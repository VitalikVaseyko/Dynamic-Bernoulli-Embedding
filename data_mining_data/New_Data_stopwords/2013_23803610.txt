 Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) emerged important factor pancreatic beta cell biology, tight regulation TXNIP levels necessary beta cell survival. However, mechanisms regulating TXNIP expression started elucidated. forkhead boxO1 transcription factor (FOXO1) reported up-regulate TXNIP expression neurons endothelial cells down-regulate TXNIP liver, effects beta cells remained unknown. found FOXO1 binds TXNIP promoter vivo human islets INS-1 beta cells significantly decreases TXNIP expression. TXNIP promoter deletion analyses revealed E-box motif conferring carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP)-mediated, glucose-induced TXNIP expression necessary sufficient effect, electromobility shift assays confirmed FOXO1 binding site. Moreover, FOXO1 blocked glucose-induced TXNIP expression reduced glucose-induced ChREBP binding TXNIP promoter without affecting ChREBP expression nuclear localization, suggesting FOXO1 may compete ChREBP binding TXNIP promoter. fact, FOXO1 DNA-binding mutant (FOXO1-H215R) failed inhibit TXNIP transcription, effects restricted TXNIP FOXO1 also inhibited transcription ChREBP target genes liver pyruvate kinase. Together, results demonstrate FOXO1 inhibits beta cell TXNIP transcription suggest FOXO1 confers inhibition interfering ChREBP DNA binding target gene promoters. findings thereby reveal novel gene regulatory mechanism previously unappreciated cross-talk FOXO1 ChREBP, two major metabolic signaling pathways.
