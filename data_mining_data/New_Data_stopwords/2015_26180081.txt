 defining hallmark glioblastoma altered tumor metabolism. metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis reprogramming mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, regardless oxygen availability, phenomenon known Warburg effect. addition Warburg effect, glioblastoma tumor cells also utilize tricarboxylic acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation different capacity normal tissue. Altered metabolic enzymes metabolites oncogenic simply product tumor proliferation. highlight advantages tumor cells, including glioblastoma cells, require metabolic reprogramming tumor metabolism converge tumor epigenetics unanswered questions field.
