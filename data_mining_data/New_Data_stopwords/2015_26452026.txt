 hallmark solid tumors consumption large amounts glucose production lactate, also known Warburg-like metabolism. metabolic phenotype typical aggressive tumor growth, visualized 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake detected positron emission tomography (PET). High 18F-FDG uptake inversely correlates survival goes along reduced expression catalytic beta-subunit H+-ATP synthase (ss-F1-ATPase) several tumor entities analyzed far.For study characterized series 15 head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (i) determining 18F-FDG-uptake; (ii) quantitative expression analysis ss-F1-ATPase (Complex V), NDUF-S1 (Complex I) COX1 (Complex IV) mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), well Hsp60 (mitochondrial mass) GAPDH (glycolysis) tumor cells; (iii) sequencing mtDNA representative tumor samples.Whereas high 18F-FDG-uptake also correlates poor prognosis HNSCC, surprisingly accompanied high levels ss-F1-ATPase, analyzed proteins.In conclusion, describe completely new phenotype metabolic adaptation possibly enabling tumors highest levels ss-F1-ATPase rapidly proliferate even hypoxic zones, typical HNSCC.
