 multivariate model proposed relating short-term biomarker measurements Daphnia magna chronic effects (21-d exposure) occurring population level (time death, mean brood size, mean total young per female, intrinsic rate natural increase, net reproductive rate, growth). results short-term exposure (48 h-96 h) eight model toxicants (cadmium, chromium, mercury, tributyl tin, linear alkylsulfonic acid, sodium pentachlorophenolate, lindane, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) following biomarkers used multivariate model: digestive enzymes (amylase, cellulase, beta-galactosidase, trypsin, esterase), enzymes intermediary metabolism (glycogen phosphorylase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase), cellular energy allocation (CEA) (protein, carbohydrate, lipid content electron transport activity), DNA damage antioxidative stress activity. Using partial least squares latent structures (PLS), two-component model obtained R2 0.68 Q2 value 0.60 based combined analysis limited number 48- 96-h biomarker responses. individual population-level responses, R2 values varied 0.66 0.77 Q2 values 0.52 0.69. Energy-related biomarkers (cellular energy allocation, lipid contents, anaerobic metabolic activity--pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), combined parameters related oxidative stress (catalase) DNA damage measured 48 96 h exposure, able predict long-term effects higher levels biological organization.
