 role Warburg effect cancer remains elucidated resurgence research efforts past decade. cancer cell would prefer use energy inefficient glycolysis, leading alteration pH inside outside cell, remains uncovered. development MDR represents major challenge treatment cancer explained, far, expression drug transporters well-known archetypal P-glycoprotein (Pgp). However, controversies exist regarding function Pgp multi-drug resistance. suggest Pgp-mediated MDR relies fundamentally pH alterations mediated Warburg effect. Furthermore, propose use proton pump and/or transporters inhibitors (PPIs/PTIs) cancer key controlling MDR, i.e. sensitize tumors antineoplastic agents, drug-related adverse effects.
