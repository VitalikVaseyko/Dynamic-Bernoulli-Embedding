 regulation oxidative phosphorylation studied digitonin-treated epididymal bull spermatozoa mitochondria directly accessible low molecular compounds extracellular medium. Due high extramitochondrial ATPase activity cell preparation, possible stimulate respiration small extent added hexokinase presence glucose adenine nucleotides. Added pyruvate kinase plus phosphoenol pyruvate, however, strongly suppressed respiration. conditions, respiration found depend extramitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] ratio range 1-100. contribution adenine nucleotide translocator dependence determined titration irreversible inhibitor carboxyatractyloside presence ADP. Using lactate plus malate substrate, active state respiration controlled 30% translocator, whereas 12 4% determined presence L-glycerol-3-phosphate malate alone, respectively. order compare results intact cells, adenine nucleotide patterns determined intact digitonin-treated spermatozoa conditions controlled respiration presence vanadate carboxyatractyloside, respectively. 21% total cellular adenine nucleotides found digitonin-treated cells representing mitochondrial compartment. allowing intramitochondrial amount adenine nucleotides, cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP] ratio estimated 6-times higher mitochondrial ratio intact cells. concluded data presented principal mechanism oxidative phosphorylation sperm mitochondria regulated via extramitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] ratio demonstrated isolated mitochondria.
