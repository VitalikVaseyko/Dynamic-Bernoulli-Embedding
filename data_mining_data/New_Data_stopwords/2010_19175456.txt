 study physiological changes occurring selection contributes improved understanding relationships leading efficiencies animal production. investigate effects food restriction gastrocnemius muscle protein expression, 20% weight reduction induced New Zealand White (meat producing) wild rabbits, using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis peptide mass fingerprinting. Lower expression levels myosin heavy chains found Wild Rabbits Restricted Group, myosin light chain alpha-crystallin proteins detected restricted groups. Glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glycogen phosphorylase expression levels similar experimental groups. Phosphopyruvate hydratase beta detected wild rabbit restricted diet group. Pyruvate kinase levels 50% lower New Zealand Restricted group. LIM protein detection absent control New Zealand group. Results also show relevance actin preserving muscle structure depressed food availability, sensitivity myosin light chain alpha-crystallin protein restricted feed role PK resistance New Zealand rabbits food restriction.
