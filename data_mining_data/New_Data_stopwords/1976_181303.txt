 Two experiments performed examine effects intramuscular estradiol administration hepatic specific activities enzymes lipid, carbohydrate amino acid metabolism immature fowl. Estradiol increased specific activities hepatic lipogenic enzymes, ATP citrate lyase malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP), effects activities glycolytic, gluconeogenic amino acid metabolising enzymes except pyruvate kinase glutamate dehydrogenase reduced activity experiments. results indicate estrogen-induced increase hepatic lipid biosynthesis due specific effect lipid metabolism general increase liver metabolism.
