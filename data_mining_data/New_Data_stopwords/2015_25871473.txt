 previously reported cetuximab, EGFR-blocking antibody, inhibits cancer metabolism via downregulation HIF-1alpha reverses Warburg effect cancer cells. Here, report inhibition HIF-1 transcriptional activity cetuximab necessarily lead successful inhibition cell proliferation. several head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, observed pattern oscillating decrease increase intracellular ATP level cetuximab treatment, magnitude kinetics varied cell line appeared linked extent cellular response cetuximab. HNSCC cells low basal level AMPK activity responded cetuximab-induced growth inhibition, transient, LKB1-dependent activation AMPK. contrast, HNSCC cells high basal level AMPK activity less sensitive cetuximab-induced growth inhibition despite effective inhibition EGFR downstream signaling cetuximab. Knockdown inhibition AMPK markedly enhanced response cetuximab via induction apoptosis. findings indicate transient activation AMPK early metabolic marker cellular response cetuximab high sustained AMPK activity important mechanism cancer cells survive cetuximab treatment.
