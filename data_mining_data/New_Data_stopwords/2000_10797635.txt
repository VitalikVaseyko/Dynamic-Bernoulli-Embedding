 Alanine major amino acid utilized liver gluconeogenesis normal conditions. metabolism alanine rat liver investigated means (1)H (13)C NMR spectroscopic studies vivo vitro infusion L- D-alanine labelled (13)C carboxyl methyl group normal, fasted rats. Valuable information different metabolic pathways alanine rat liver regulation conditions gluconeogenesis obtained. enrichment alanine pool infusate estimated 11% L-alanine 70% D-alanine. infusion labelled D-alanines, metabolic pathway via D-amino acid oxidase observed. labelled alanines entered tricarboxylic acid cycle mainly via pyruvate carboxylase; ratio pyruvate dehydrogenase activity pyruvate carboxylase 28%. ratio flux phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphoenolpyruvate kinase compared flux PEP glucose approximately 42%. labelling pattern glucose concluded pentose phosphate cycle active experimental conditions.
