 PURPOSE: Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), thus promotes glucose oxidation glycolysis induces apoptotic death tumor cells. present study investigated potential DCA increase antitumor effects platinum- based compounds panel permanent cell lines, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), ovarian cancer, Ewing's sarcoma vitro. METHODS: DCA concentration 10 mM combined cisplatin, carboplatin, satraplatin, satraplatin metabolite JM118, oxaliplatin, oxoplatin, picoplatin, cytotoxic activity evaluated proliferation tests employing panel different cell lines. Additionally, cells pretreated DCA exposed platinum drugs etoposide, incubated cisplatin etoposide followed application DCA, respectively. RESULTS: DCA 10 mM significantly increased cytotoxicity platinum-based drugs carboplatin, satraplatin, JM118, oxoplatin, cisplatin, picoplatin, oxaliplatin vitro. Preincubation cell lines DCA 10 mM three days reduced antiproliferative activity platinum-based agents sequential application, exposure cells pretreated cisplatin etoposide DCA resulted minor sensitization. inhibitory effect DCA showed correlation sensitization platinum compounds. CONCLUSION: DCA alone concentration shows low antiproliferative activity capable increasing cytotoxicity selected platinum compounds upon coincubation, combinations may interesting clinical application tumors like SCLC, Ewing's sarcoma, ovarian cancer refractory cisplatin chemotherapy standard care. mechanism synergistic effect DCA combination specific platinum species remains investigated.
