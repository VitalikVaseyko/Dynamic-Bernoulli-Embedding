 F-Actin (FA) pyruvate kinase (PK) [EC 2.7.1.40] immobilized PAB-cellulose. HMM-Subfragment-1 (S-1) applied column immobilized FA PK, eluted 1-1.5 muM ATP 1 mM PEP 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8 4 degrees. size initial burst Pi liberation S-1 applied column 0.5 mole/mole S-1. burst size S-1 decreased increase fraction number, S-1 later fractions showed burst size 0.1-0.3 mole/mole. hand, rate ATPase [EC 3.6.1.3] reaction steady state almost independent burst size, increased slightly increase fraction number. ATPase activity S-1 burst size less 0.2 mole/mole scarcely activated FA. Usually, dependence burst size S-1 ATPase activity presence FA sigmoidal, marked activation FA observed burst size larger 0.3-0.4 mole/mole. Similar results obtained S-1 fractions separated ultracentrifugation method described previous paper ((1976) J. Biochem. 79, 419-434).
