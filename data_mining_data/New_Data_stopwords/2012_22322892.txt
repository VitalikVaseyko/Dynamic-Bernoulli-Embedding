 many years taken advantage special metabolism cancer cells involving increased consumption glucose associated lactic acid production even presence oxygen, phenomenon referred "Warburg effect", counteract cancer cell growth. tested 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), inhibitor pyruvate-associated reactions. Firstly, tested agent, vitro, two mesothelioma cell lines. Cellular response would appear depend mode administration (immediately 24 h seeding). Depending line, 3-BrPA induced cytostatic cytotoxic effect. effect accompanied cell death induction even cells highly refractory cisplatin. Mitochondrial apoptotic death appeared involve lines; however, different death pathway necrosis cannot excluded. Interestingly, 3-BrPA leads diminution expression anti-apotptoic protein Mcl-1. tested 3-BrPA vivo. Survival nude mice bearing human mesothelioma significantly prolonged (p < 0.0001). Toxicity clinical studies performed test 3- BrPA local therapy patients suffering pleural peritoneal mesothelioma. Association cisplatin particularly considered.
