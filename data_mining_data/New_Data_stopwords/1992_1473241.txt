 Renal clear cell tubules clear/acidophilic cell tumors induced male Sprague-Dawley rats 7 weeks oral administration (stop model) N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM) concentration 12 mg/100 ml drinking water. Twelve, 23 34 weeks withdrawal NNM serial cryostat sections kidneys histochemically analyzed following parameters: glucose transporter proteins (GLUT1, GLUT2), glycogen content activities glycogen synthase (SYN), glycogen phosphorylase (PHO), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), hexokinase (HK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acid phosphatase (ACP) gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Clear cell (glycogenotic) tubules first appeared 23 weeks, clear/acidophilic cell tumors 34 weeks withdrawal carcinogen. G6Pase, ALP, GGT GLUT2 absent clear cell tubules, clear/acidophilic cell tubules, clear/acidophilic cell tumors indicating sequential origin types lesions collecting duct system, line previous morphological findings. comparison collecting duct epithelium, glycogenotic tubules demonstrated increased activity PHO reduced activities glycolytic mitochondrial enzymes, accompanied strongly reduced expression GLUT1. Moderately increased activities glycolytic mitochondrial enzymes observed clear cells clear/acidophilic cell tubules tumors compared glycogenotic tubules. slightly increased activities glycolytic enzymes GAPDH PK compared normal collecting duct epithelium, nearly lacking GLUT1. findings suggest glycogen storage due increased uptake glucose blood, results disturbance intracellular flux metabolites. development clear cell tubules normal collecting duct epithelium accompanied markedly decreased expression GLUT1 along reduction glycolytic mitochondrial enzymes. reduction enzyme activities replaced increase enzyme activities clear/acidophilic cell tumors indicating fundamental shift carbohydrate metabolism progression preneoplastic neoplastic lesions.
