 P. aeruginosa PAK pili thin 5.2 nm diameter filaments containing single 15-kd polypeptide subunit 144 amino acid residues length. Studies pili binding variety synthetic sugars representing many di- tri- tetra-saccharide structures found mammalian glycoproteins glycolipids failed reveal significant binding activity. hand, wide spectrum binding activities observed variety structural proteins enzymes used binding substrates. 30 proteins tested, phosphorylase b, pyruvate kinase aldolase showed highest pilus binding activity. concluded PAK pilus receptor probably polypeptide rather oligosaccharide. Using arginine-specific cleavage produce four large peptides, several proteases produce subfragments large peptides, antipilus rabbit antiserum, PAK pilin found contain four antigenic determinants. Epitopes near NH2- COOH-termini weakly immunogenic, whereas two epitopes near center pilus protein titrated 85% antipilus antibodies. Cleavage pilus protein smaller peptides resulted marked decreases affinity antigenic peptides specific antibodies, suggesting immunodominant epitopes PAK pilin conformation-specific.
