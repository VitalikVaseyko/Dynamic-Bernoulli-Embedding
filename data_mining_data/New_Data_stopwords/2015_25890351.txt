 Cancer cells long known fuel pathogenic growth habits sustaining high glycolytic flux, first described almost 90 years ago so-called Warburg effect. Immune cells utilize similar strategy generate energy carriers metabolic intermediates need produce biomass inflammatory mediators. Resting lymphocytes generate energy oxidative phosphorylation breakdown fatty acids, upon activation rapidly switch aerobic glycolysis low tricarboxylic acid flux. cells patients rheumatoid arthritis (RA) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease-specific metabolic signature may explain, least part, dysfunctional. RA cells characterized low adenosine triphosphate lactate levels increased availability cellular reductant NADPH. anti-Warburg effect results insufficient activity glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase differentiates metabolic status RA cells cancer cells. Excess production reactive oxygen species defect lipid metabolism characterizes metabolic conditions SLE cells. Owing increased production glycosphingolipids lactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide monosialotetrahexosylganglioside, SLE cells change membrane raft formation fail phosphorylate pERK, yet hyperproliferate. Borrowing cancer metabolomics, metabolic modifications occurring autoimmune disease probably heterogeneous context dependent. Variations glucose, amino acid lipid metabolism different disease states may provide opportunities develop biomarkers exploit metabolic pathways therapeutic targets.
