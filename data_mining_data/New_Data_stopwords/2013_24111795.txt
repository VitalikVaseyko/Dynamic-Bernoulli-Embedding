 SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic hypoxia drive maladaptive responses numerous organ systems, leading multitude chronic mammalian diseases. Oxygen homeostasis intimately linked mitochondrial metabolism, dysfunction systems combine form backbone hypoxic-ischemic injury multiple tissue beds. Increased appreciation crucial roles hypoxia-associated miRNA (hypoxamirs) metabolism adds new dimension understanding regulation hypoxia-induced disease. RECENT ADVANCES: Myriad factors related glycolysis (e.g., aldolase hexokinase II), tricarboxylic acid cycle function (e.g., glutaminase iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein 1/2), apoptosis (e.g., p53) recently implicated targets hypoxamirs. addition, several hypoxamirs implicated regulation master transcription factor hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, clarifying cellular program hypoxia sustained resolved. CRITICAL ISSUES: Central discussion metabolic change hypoxia Warburg effect, shift toward anaerobic metabolism persists normal oxygen levels restored. Many newly discovered targets hypoxia-driven microRNA converge pathways known involved pathological phenomenon apoptosis-resistant phenotype associated it. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: often synergistic functions miRNA may make ideal therapeutic targets. use antisense inhibitors currently considered diseases hypoxia metabolic dysregulation predominate. addition, exploration pleiotripic miRNA functions likely continue offer unique insights mechanistic relationships downstream target pathways associated hypoxic phenotypes.
