 Creatine kinase (CK) enzyme often utilized detection carriers gene X-linked muscular dystrophies. 1974, pyruvate kinase (PK) levels also found increased carriers. objective present study, carried 77 women related patients Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), compare efficiency two enzymes detection process. 11 obligate heterozygotes DMD gene group, 8 exhibited elevated mean CK levels, 6 elevated mean PK levels, 9 elevated mean levels least one enzymes. Among mothers isolated patients, 2/13 elevated mean CK levels, 3/13 elevated mean PK levels, 5/13 elevated mean levels least one enzymes. Thus, study confirms data obtained investigators indicating use PK increase detection rate carriers gene X-linked muscular dystrophies.
