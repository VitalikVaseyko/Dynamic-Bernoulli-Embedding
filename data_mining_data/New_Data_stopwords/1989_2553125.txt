 Interactions glycolytic enzymes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose-phosphate isomerase, enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase type-M, lactate dehydrogenase type-H tubulin microtubules studied. Lactate dehydrogenase type-M, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase demonstrated greatest amount co-pelleting microtubules. presence 7% poly(ethylene glycol) increased co-pelleting latter four enzymes two enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase microtubules. Interactions also characterized fluorescence anisotropy. Since KD values glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase tubulin microtubules found 1 4 microM, range enzyme concentration cells, enzymes probably bound microtubules vivo. observations indicate interactions cytosolic proteins, glycolytic enzymes, cytoskeletal components, microtubules, may play structural role formation microtrabecular lattice.
