 purpose investigation determine whether link sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) glycogen status SR Ca2+ handling. investigation, skeletal muscle SR purified female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g). Glycogen extracted SR purified one hindlimb, whereas SR purified contralateral limb served control. removal tissue, animals anesthetized intraperitoneal injection ketamine (80 mg/kg) xylazine (10 mg/kg). alpha-amylase treatment (AM) removal EDTA homogenization storage buffers reduced amount glycogen associated SR (P < 0.05). treatment reduced glycogen phosphorylase content SR (P < 0.05). contrast, creatine kinase (CK) pyruvate kinase (PK) contents increased glycogen extraction protocols (P < 0.05). exogenous ATP conditions, EDTA-free (EF) treatments resulted increase Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity normalized sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) content (P < 0.05). CK PK-supported SR Ca2+ uptake decreased (P < 0.05) group normalized SERCA CK SERCA PK content, respectively. effective EF extracting glycogen associated purified SR. Glycogen extraction alters yield purified SR proteins must taken account investigating SR calcium handling. Removal glycogen purified SR causes change Ca2+-handling properties measured ATPase uptake activities.
