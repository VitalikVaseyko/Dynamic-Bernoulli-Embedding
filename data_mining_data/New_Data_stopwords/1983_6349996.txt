 Evidence direct metabolic effect insulin isolated liver preparations scarce. stimulation glycolysis insulin previously demonstrated monolayer cultures adult rat hepatocytes [(1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 126, 271-278] investigated. degree stimulation varied age culture amounted 250%, 200%, 500% 200% control value using cells culture age 2 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, respectively. Half-maximal dose insulin 0.1 nM. Maximal stimulation reached within 5 min lasted least 4 h. Dexamethasone acted long-term short-term modulator. Long-term pretreatment cells dexamethasone proved necessary permit insulin action. addition permissive action, pretreatment dexamethasone reduced insulin-independent basal glycolytic rate. short-term experiments dexamethasone decreased basal glycolytic flux, however, affect absolute increase glycolysis brought insulin. half-maximal dose dexamethasone 10 nM. stimulatory effects insulin may part attributed activation pyruvate kinase. Insulin produced left-shift substrate saturation curve, decreasing K0.5 value phosphoenolpyruvate.
