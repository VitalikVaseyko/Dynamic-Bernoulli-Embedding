 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) one major cause morbidity mortality affects 1.7 million people USA. couple regenerative pathways including activation hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) initiated reduce cellular damage following TBI; however endogenous activation pathways enough provide neuroprotection TBI. Thus aimed see whether sustained activation HIF-1alpha provide neuroprotection neurorepair following TBI. found chronic treatment dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) markedly increases expression level HIF-1alpha mRNA levels downstream proteins Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 4 (PDK1, PDK4) Erythropoietin (EPO). Treatment DMOG activates major cell survival protein kinase Akt reduces cell death lesion volume following TBI. Moreover, administration DMOG augments cluster differentiation 31 (CD31) staining pericontusional cortex TBI, suggests DMOG stimulates angiogenesis TBI. Treatment DMOG also improves memory motor functions TBI. Taken together results suggest sustained activation HIF-1alpha provides significant neuroprotection following TBI.
