 Pyruvate kinase pig heart inactivated specific arginyl reagent phenylglyoxal. loss activity caused reaction single molecule phenylglyoxal per subunit enzyme. inactivation 3 - 6 arginyl residues modified dependent concentration phenylglyoxal used modification. solubility protein reduced modification. ATP phosphoenolpyruvate protect inactivation. single arginine less subject chemical modification presence. Therefore assume arginine essential substrate binding site. activating ion K affectinactivation, Mg2 diminishes inactivation. Pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle modified phenylglyoxal similar manner.
