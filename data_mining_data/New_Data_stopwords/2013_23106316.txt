 protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2)-interacting fragment (PIF) pocket phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) proposed novel target site allosteric modulators. present work, describe design, synthesis, structure-activity relationship series 2-(3-oxo-1,3-diphenylpropyl)malonic acids potent allosteric activators binding PIF pocket. congeners displayed AC(50) values PDK1 activation submicromolar range. potency best compounds stabilize PDK1 thermal stability shift assay order magnitude PIF pocket binding peptide PIFtide, suggesting comparable binding affinities PIF pocket. crystal structure PDK1 complex compound 4h revealed additional ionic interactions mainly responsible increased potency compared monocarboxylate analogues. Notably, several compounds displayed high selectivity PDK1. Employing prodrug strategy, able corroborate novel mechanism action cells.
