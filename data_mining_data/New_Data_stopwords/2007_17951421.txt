 influence body size metabolic rate, muscle enzyme activities underlying patterns mRNA enzymes explored effort explain genetic basis allometric variation metabolic enzymes. studied two pairs sister species centrarchid fish: black bass (largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui) sunfish (pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus bluegill Lepomis macrochirus). goal assess regulatory basis intraspecific interspecific variation relative body size, well gain insights evolutionary constraints within lineages. Whole animal routine metabolic rate showed scaling coefficients significantly different 1, ranging (+0.87 +0.96). However, significant effects body size specific activities oxidative glycolytic enzymes. Mass-specific activity oxidative enzyme citrate synthase (CS) scaled negatively body size species, scaling coefficients ranging -0.15 -0.19, whereas glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) showed positive scaling, scaling coefficients ranging +0.08 +0.23. ratio mass-specific enzyme activity PK CS increased body size, whereas ratio mRNA transcripts PK CS unaffected, suggesting enzyme relationships due simply transcriptional regulation genes. mass-dependent differences PK activities best explained transcriptional regulation muscle PK gene; PK mRNA good predictor PK specific enzyme activity within species species. Conversely, CS mRNA correlate CS specific enzyme activities, suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms may explain observed inter-specific intraspecific differences oxidative enzymes.
