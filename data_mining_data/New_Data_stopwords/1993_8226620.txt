 ski22::Tn917lac insertion mutation Bacillus subtilis isolated screen mutations cause defect sporulation suppressed presence overexpression histidine protein kinase encoded kinA (spoIIJ). ski22::Tn917lac insertion mutation ald, gene encoding alanine dehydrogenase. Alanine dehydrogenase catalyzes deamination alanine pyruvate ammonia needed growth alanine sole carbon nitrogen source. sporulation defect caused null mutations ald partly relieved addition pyruvate high concentration, indicating normal role alanine dehydrogenase sporulation might generate pyruvate provide energy source sporulation. spoVN::Tn917 mutation also found allele ald. Transcription ald induced early sporulation addition exogenous alanine growth. Expression ald normal regulatory mutants tested, including spo0A, spo0K, comA, sigB, sigD mutants. gene mutations affected expression ald ald itself. regulation probably related metabolism alanine.
