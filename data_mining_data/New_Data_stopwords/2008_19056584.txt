 BACKGROUND: Obesity caused excessive accumulation adipose tissue result chronic energy surplus. Little known regarding molecular mechanisms involved response energy surplus human adipose tissue genomic level. OBJECTIVE: objective investigate changes transcriptome abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue positive energy challenge induced overfeeding lean obese subjects identify novel obesity candidate genes. DESIGN: total 26 men recruited classified basis percentage body fat (measured dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) lean (<20%) obese (>25%) participate baseline comparison. Sixteen men participated overfeeding study (8 lean 8 obese). Adipose tissue biopsy samples collected subjects subumbilical region. Global gene expression profiles determined baseline 7-d hypercaloric diet 40% normal energy requirements using whole human genome DNA microarrays. RESULTS: Overfeeding induced differential expression 45 genes. Six genes displayed significant interaction effect adiposity status overfeeding treatment, including transferrin (TF), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), transaldolase 1 (TALDO1), cathepsin C (CTSC), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4). Overfeeding resulted changes expression genes lean subjects, whereas significant changes evident obese subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression 6 genes may represent protective mechanism molecular level lean subjects response energy surplus. genes represent valuable candidates downstream studies related obesity.
