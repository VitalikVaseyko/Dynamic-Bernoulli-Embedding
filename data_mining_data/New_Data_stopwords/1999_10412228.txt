 Plastidic pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) purified near homogeneity judged native PAGE 4% recovery developing seeds Brassica campestris using (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, gel filtration Sepharose-CL-6B affinity chromatography reactive blue Sepharose-CL-6B. purified enzyme molecular mass 266 kDa quite stable showed broad pH optimum pH 6.8-7.8. Typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics obtained substrates K(m) values 0.13 0.14 mM PEP ADP, respectively. enzyme could also utilize CDP, GDP UDP alternative nucleotide ADP, lower Vmax higher K(m). enzyme absolute requirement divalent monovalent cation activity inhibited oxalate, fumarate, citrate, isocitrate ATP, activated AMP, aspartate, 3-PGA, tryptophan inorganic phosphate. ATP inhibited enzyme competitively respect PEP non-competitively respect ADP. Similarly, oxalate inhibition also competitive type respect PEP non-competitive respect ADP. inhibition either ATP oxalate due chelation Mg2+, inhibition relieved increasing Mg2+ concentration even upto 30 mM. Initial velocity product inhibition studies demonstrated reaction mechanism compulsory ordered type. enzyme seems regulated synergistically ATP citrate.
