 insulinoma beta-cell line INS-1 expresses L-type pyruvate kinase gene high level responds rise extracellular glucose strong induction gene expression. Following addition glucose culture medium 3.5-33 mM concentration range, cellular level L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA increases within 2 h reaches maximum 15-fold basal 8-12 h. run-on nuclear assay, relative transcription rate pyruvate kinase gene shown increase 4-fold maximal stimulation, suggesting transcriptional post-transcriptional effects contribute mRNA accumulation. glucose effect totally suppressed hexokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose, indicating requirement glucose phosphorylation. mRNA induction inhibited glutamine-free culture medium azaserine, suggesting hexosamine biosynthetic pathway involved. Moreover, metabolism along glycolytic pathway appear absolute requisite, since 2-deoxyglucose partly mimics inductive effect glucose. glucose effect pyruvate kinase gene reversibly antagonized agents increasing intracellular cAMP. addition, effect highly specific pyruvate kinase gene. Neither proinsulin mRNA glucokinase mRNA increased glucose-stimulated INS-1 cells. Short term transfection CAT plasmids driven pyruvate kinase L promoter reveals specific glucose-inducible reporter activity 183-base pair promoter region upstream cap site. Within region, previously described L4 cis-acting element crucial glucose responsiveness, demonstrated fact plasmid mutation element elicit glucose-inducible CAT activity. Induction L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA occurs islets rats subjected fasting carbohydrate refeeding. conclusion, L-type pyruvate kinase gene provides interesting model glucose-regulated gene endocrine beta-cell type.
