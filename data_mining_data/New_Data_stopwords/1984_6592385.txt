 probably promoter-specific decrease L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) Wistar rat liver described. possibility utilizing decrease L-PK activity screening hepatic promoters discussed. significantly decreased level activity L-PK observed continuous feedings hepatocarcinogen 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene [(3'-MeDAB) CAS: 55-80-1], initiates promotes hepatocarcinogenesis, known hepatic promoters phenobarbital [(PB) CAS: 50-06-6] dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (CAS: 50-29-3) least 4 weeks. contrast, occurred, decrease L-PK activity nonpromoting agents amobarbital (CAS: 57-43-2) diphenylhydantoin. (CAS: 57-41-0) temporary almost overcome 4th week. depression L-PK activity caused PB reversible, inversely correlated PB concentration diet, seemed organ-specific. Although hepatic promoters lowered L-PK activity study, data limited much extensive study necessary general conclusion drawn. contrast L-PK activity, activity K-type pyruvate kinase (K-PK) induced injections carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (CAS: 55-18-5) hepatotoxin CCl4 (CAS: 56-23-5) feeding 3'-MeDAB. However, feeding PB 2-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (CAS: 54-88-6), initiates promote hepatocarcinogenesis, increase K-PK activity.
