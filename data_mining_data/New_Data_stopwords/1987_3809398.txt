 Biochemical blood perfusion changes mouse tumor system (MDAH MCaIV) studied relative normal tissues conditions normal blood flow clamped blood supply. studies performed tumor growth local X irradiation. biochemical profiles three untreated human soft tissue sarcomas also investigated. Animal tumors irradiated situ either single fractionated regime total doses 20 49 Gy. Assays lactate, pyruvate, AMP, ADP, ATP made freeze-clamped tissue following authentic sham treatments. Blood perfusion tumors treated way measured using iv injection 201Tl. human tumors found lower lactate pyruvate ratio (L/P) MCaIV tumors; ATP levels also lower. L/P much higher MCaIV tumors normal liver, kidney, muscle mouse. Occlusion blood supplies normal kidney MCaIV tumor caused increase lactate L/P levels cases. However, whereas ATP level kidney fell, level tumor maintained. evidence adenine nucleotides equilibrium via adenyl kinase catalyzed reaction. addition, tumors found contain enzyme creatine kinase. results suggest energy charge calculations cannot computed meaningful manner creatine kinase catalyzed phosphorylation ADP would maintain higher normal ATP level. Lactate L/P ratio found increase tumor growth decrease following X irradiation. total adenine nucleotides (AMP + ADP + ATP) exhibited trend toward lower values increasing tumor size. significant change total adenine nucleotides single 20-Gy dose; however, fractionated radiation caused fall total nucleotides. concluded that, tumor system, lactate level sensitive index radiation-induced biochemical changes likely reflect changes tumor oxygenation.
