 Glucose Fatty Acid Cycle formulated 30 years ago reviewed Minkowski lecture 1966 described short term effects fatty acids (minutes) decrease uptake, glycolysis oxidation glucose heart skeletal muscles. short term effects since extended include inhibition glucose uptake glycolysis stimulation gluconeogenesis liver effects also convincingly demonstrated man vivo. recently longer term effect fatty acid metabolism decrease glucose oxidation (hours) shown heart skeletal muscle liver. effect increases specific activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, turn results enhanced phosphorylation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex major determinant glucose oxidation rate. seems likely longer term effects fatty acids aspects glucose metabolism could important development insulin resistance diabetes mellitus man.
