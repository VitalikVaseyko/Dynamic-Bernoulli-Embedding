 Forty-two chemical substances, chosen might influence red cell metabolism, screened effect red cell adenosine triphosphate 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) levels storage CPD CPDA-1 4 degrees C. substances, six appeared initial screening increase 2,3 DPG levels storage; repeated examination, four compounds, i.e., oxalate, glyoxalate, ethyl oxaloacetate, L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine, consistently increased 2,3 DPG levels storage. shown glyoxalate converted rapidly oxalate blood, presumably lactate dehydrogenase reaction. Ethyl oxaloacetate known hydrolyze, giving rise oxalate. Thus, effect glyoxalate ethyl oxaloacetate explained formation oxalate, compound already known increase 2,3 DPG levels. effect L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine remains explained, may hydrolyzed L-alanine L-phenylalanine, thought capacity increase red cell 2,3 DPG levels inhibiting pyruvate kinase activity.
