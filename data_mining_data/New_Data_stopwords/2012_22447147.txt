 Familial dilated cardiomyopathy primary myocardial disease result development congestive heart failure sudden cardiac death. Spontaneous animal models familial dilated cardiomyopathy exist Doberman pinscher dog one commonly reported canine breeds. objective study evaluate familial dilated cardiomyopathy Doberman pinscher dog using genome-wide association study genetic alteration(s) associated development disease canine model. Genome-wide association analysis identified area statistical significance canine chromosome 14 (p(raw) = 9.999e-05 corrected genome-wide significance), fine-mapping additional SNPs flanking region localized signal 23,774,190-23,781,919 (p = 0.001) DNA sequencing identified 16-base pair deletion 5' donor splice site intron 10 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene affected dogs (p < 0.0001). Electron microscopy myocardium affected dogs demonstrated disorganization Z line, mild moderate tubule sarcoplasmic reticulum dilation, marked pleomorphic mitochondrial alterations megamitochondria, scattered mitochondria whorling vacuolization mild aggregates lipofuscin granules. conclusion, report identification splice site deletion PDK4 gene associated development familial dilated cardiomyopathy Doberman pinscher dog.
