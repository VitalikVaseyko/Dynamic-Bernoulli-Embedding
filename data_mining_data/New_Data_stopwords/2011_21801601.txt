 Mitochondrial processes play important role tumor initiation progression. review, focus three critical processes mitochondrial function may contribute cancer: alterations glucose metabolism, production reactive oxygen species (ROS) compromise intrinsic apoptotic function. Alterations cancer glucose metabolism include Warburg effect, leading shift metabolism away aerobic respiration toward glycolysis, even sufficient oxygen present support respiration. alterations cellular metabolism may favor tumor cell growth increasing availability biosynthetic intermediates needed cellular growth proliferation. Mutations specific metabolic enzymes, namely succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase isocitrate dehydrogenases, linked human cancer. Mitochondrial ROS may contribute cancer via DNA damage activation aberrant signaling pathways. ROS-dependent stabilization transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) may particularly important event tumorigenesis. Compromised function intrinsic apoptosis removes important cellular safeguard cancer implicated tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, chemoresistance. major mitochondrial processes linked. review, outline connections address ways mitochondrial pathways may targeted cancer therapy.
