 Several approaches reduce acetate accumulation Escherichia coli cultures recently reported. reduction subsequently led significant enhancement recombinant protein production. studies, metabolically engineered E. coli strains reduced acetate synthesis rates constructed modification glucose uptake rate, elimination critical enzymes involved acetate formation pathways, redirection carbon flux toward less inhibitory byproducts. particular, shown strains carrying Bacillus subtilis acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene produce less acetate also higher ATP yield. Metabolic flux analysis carbon flux distribution central metabolic pathways pyruvate branch point revealed strain ability channel excess pyruvate much less toxic compound, acetoin. main focus study systematic analysis effects small perturbations host's existing pathways redistribution carbon fluxes. Specifically, mutant deleted acetate kinase (ACK) acetyl phosphotransferase (PTA) constructed studied. Results metabolic analysis carbon redistribution show ackA-pta mutation reduce acetate level expense growth rate. addition, ackA-pta deficient strain much higher lactate formation rate simultaneously lower formate ethanol synthesis rates found. Expression B. subtilis ALS ackA-pta mutants reduces acetate levels cell density similar parent strain attained.
