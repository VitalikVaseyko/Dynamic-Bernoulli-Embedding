 Creatinine amidohydrolase used measure serum creatinine totally enzymatic procedure. Creatine, produced hydrolysis, acted upon creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, result change absorbance 340 nm. amount creatinine present related rate change A340 determined standard curve. Absorbance concentration linearly related 100 mg/liter 250 mul serum required. 1.0 g/liter, heparin, oxalate, citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, ascorbate, glucose significant effect accurate determination creatinine; higher concentrations (30 g/liter) inhibitory effects test. Analytical recovery creatinine added either normal abnormal sera averaged 102%. results procedure standard direct Jaffe test compared, latter significantly higher. Unlike Jaffe method, present method determining creatinine rapid (about 10 min per test), subject interfering substances, requires serum deproteinization.
