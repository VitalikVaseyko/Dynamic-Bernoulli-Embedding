 Ethyl pyruvate (EP), simple aliphatic ester pyruvic acid, shown antiinflammatory effects confer protective effects various pathological conditions. Recently, number studies reported EP inhibits high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) secretion suggest might contribute antiinflammatory effect. Since EP used calcium-containing balanced salt solution (Ringer solution), wondered EP directly chelates Ca(2+) related EP-mediated suppression HMGB1 release. Calcium imaging assays revealed EP significantly dose-dependently suppressed high K(+)-induced transient [Ca(2+)]i surges primary cortical neurons and, similarly, fluorometric assays showed EP directly scavenges Ca(2+) peak fluorescence emission intensities Mag-Fura-2 (a low-affinity Ca(2+) indicator) shifted presence EP concentrations >/=7 mmol/L. Furthermore, EP markedly suppressed A23187-induced intracellular Ca(2+) surge BV2 cells and, condition, A23187-induced activations Ca(2+)-mediated kinases (protein kinase Calpha calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV), HMGB1 phosphorylation subsequent secretion HMGB1 also suppressed. (A23187 calcium ionophore BV2 cells microglia cell line.) Moreover, above-mentioned EP-mediated effects obtained independent cell death survival, suggests direct effects EP. Together, results indicate EP directly chelates Ca(2+), is, least part, responsible suppression HMGB1 release EP.
