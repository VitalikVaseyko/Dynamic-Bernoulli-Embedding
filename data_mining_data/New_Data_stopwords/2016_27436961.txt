 Biocatalytic reactions often require supplying chemical energy phosphate groups form adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Auxiliary enzymes used convert reaction by-product-adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-back ATP. employing real-time mass spectrometry (RTMS), one gain insight inter-conversions reactants multi-enzyme reaction systems optimize reaction conditions. study, temporal traces ions corresponding adenosine monophosphate (AMP), ADP ATP provided vital information could used adjust activities 'buffering enzymes'. Using RTMS results feedback, also characterized bienzymatic energy buffer enables recovery ATP cases directly hydrolysed AMP main enzymatic reaction. significance careful selection enzyme activities-guided RTMS-is exemplified synthesis glucose-6-phosphate hexokinase presence buffering enzyme, pyruvate kinase. Relative activities two enzymes, present reaction mixture, influence biosynthetic reaction yields. observation supports conclusion optimization chemical energy recycling procedures critical biosynthetic reaction economy.
