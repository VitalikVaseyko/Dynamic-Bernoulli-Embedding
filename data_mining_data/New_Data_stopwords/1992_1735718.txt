 mutual adjustment glucose uptake metabolism insect stage protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei studied. T. brucei preadapted chemostat conditions either glucose proline served major carbon energy source. Cells grown adapted either energy non-energy limitation low dilution rate (0.5 day-1) high dilution rate (1 day-1). cells used short- medium-term uptake experiments D-[14C]glucose tracer. time course experiments steady state reached 15 min regardless preadaptation conditions. steady-state level increased increasing glucose availability preadaptation. rate glucose uptake hexokinase activity linearly correlated. short-term 5- 90-s) uptake experiments high transport rate measured cultures grown excess glucose, intermediate rate measured proline-grown cultures, low rate measured organisms grown glucose limitation. Glucose metabolism proline metabolism affect 15-min incubations. Glucose uptake, function external glucose concentration, obey simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics could described two-step mechanism: (i) transport glucose facilitated diffusion (ii) subsequent metabolism glucose. respective rates two steps adjusted other. concluded T. brucei capable adjusting different metabolic processes way gives maximum energy efficiency cost short-term flexibility.
