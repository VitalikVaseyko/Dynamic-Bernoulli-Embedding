 Glucose, Claude Bernard demonstrated 1850 synthesized secreted liver, important regulator gene transcription types organisms. vertebrates, especially regulates transcription metabolic genes liver fat tissue, activating genes encoding enzymes regulators glycolytic lipogenic pathways. Working L-type pyruvate kinase gene found hepatocytes glucose-dependent gene regulation requires: Presence GLUT2 glucose transporter, necessary allow effective depletion glucose 6-phosphate (G-6P) gluconeogenic conditions. Phosphorylation glucose G-6P assured either insulin-dependent glucokinase another hexokinase isoform. likely, entry G-6P pentose phosphate pathway. Modulation kinase/phosphatase cascade, particular inhibition 5'AMP-activated protein kinase. Signalling glucose response complex assembled onto glucose-response element (GIRE) located regulatory regions glucose-responsive genes. activators USF belong complex, required normal gene activation glucose, evidenced phenotype knock-out mice deficient USF. study USF-defective knock-out mice suggest USF could involved nutritional activation whole class genes regulated glucose, insulin itself. particular, lipogenic genes ob gene, encoding leptin satiety hormone, abnormally responsive diet USF-/- mice. transactivation potential USF would modulated glucose sensor system implying COUP-TFII transcription inhibitor. main role insulin glucose response genes like L-PK gene induce glucokinase gene. Glucagon, cyclic AMP, inhibits L-PK gene transcription mainly activation PKA. PKA catalytic subunit could act phosphorylating member(s) glucose-response complex, contiguous transcription factor, e.g. HNF4. conclusion, pluridisciplinary approach ranging Claude Bernard-derived biology modern molecular biology, important progress made last years mechanisms regulation gene transcription glucose vertebrates.
