 Purified rat adipocyte plasma membranes incubated insulin produce soluble chemical mediator stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase added isolated mitochondria, glycogen synthase added cell homogenates. mediator appears peptide characterized conventional chromatographic methods including gel filtration, ion exchange, hydroxylapatite chromatography. studies reveal insulin-dependent bioactive component, small negatively charged pH 7.4, eluted Dowex 1 x 4 0.3-0.4 N NaCl hydroxylapatite 0.05-0.15 potassium phosphate. mediator also partially purified high-pressure liquid chromatography. molecular sieving matrix produces peak insulin-dependent bioactivity corresponds peak absorbance 210 nm (apparent Mr 2000) increased insulin. Reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography indicates insulin-dependent bioactivity hydrophilic nature. Previous studies showed release mediator plasma membranes response insulin blocked inhibitors serine proteases esters arginine. addition, bioactivity insulin-treated plasma membrane supernatant could destroyed protease treatment. present experiments, pretreatment intact adipocytes serine protease inhibitors blocked action subsequently added insulin several intracellular enzyme systems. observations summarized following working model one mode insulin action. binding insulin receptor activates membrane protease alters endogenous membrane substrate, resulting increased release cell small peptide fragment proteolytic cleavage. released peptide proposed modulate several cellular enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase glycogen synthase interacting phosphoprotein phosphatase protein kinase activities, both.
