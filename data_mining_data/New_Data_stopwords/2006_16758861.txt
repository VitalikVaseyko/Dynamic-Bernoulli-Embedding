 work concerned metabolism Caldithrix abyssi-an anaerobic, moderately thermophilic bacterium isolated deep-sea hydrothermal vents Mid-Atlantic Ridge representing new, deeply deviated branch within domain Bacteria. Cells C. abyssi grown acetate nitrate, reduced ammonium, possessed nitrate reductase activity contained cytochromes b c types. Utilization acetate occurred result operation TCA glyoxylate cycles. growth C. abyssi yeast extract, fermentation formation acetate, propionate, hydrogen, CO2 occurred. extracts cells grown yeast extract, acetate produced pyruvate involvement following enzymes: pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (2.6 micromol/(min mg protein)), phosphate acetyltransferase (0.46 micromol/(min mg protein)), acetate kinase (0.3 micromol/(min mg protein)). activity fumarate reductase (0.14 micromol/(min mg protein)), malate dehydrogenase (0.17 micromol/(min mg protein)), fumarate hydratase (1.2 micromol/(min mg protein)), well presence cytochrome b, points formation propionate via methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway. activity antioxidant enzymes (catalase superoxide dismutase) detected. Thus, enzymatic mechanisms elucidated allow C. abyssi switch fermentation anaerobic respiration exist gradient redox conditions characteristic deep-sea hydrothermal vents.
