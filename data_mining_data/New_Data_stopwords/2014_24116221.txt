 Cardiac function depends ability switch fatty acid glucose oxidation energy production response changes substrate availability energetic stress. obese diabetic individuals, increased reliance fatty acids reduced metabolic flexibility thought contribute development cardiovascular disease. Mechanisms cardiac mitochondria contribute diet-induced metabolic inflexibility investigated. Mice fed high fat low fat diet 1 d, 1 wk, 20 wk. Cardiac mitochondria isolated mice fed high fat diet displayed diminished ability utilize glycolytically derived substrate pyruvate. response rapid, occurring within first day diet, persisted 20 wk. selective increase expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase responsible rapid suppression pyruvate utilization. important consequence pyruvate dehydrogenase sensitized inhibition mitochondria respire presence fatty acids. Additionally, increased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 preceded observed diet-induced reductions levels glucose transporter type 4 glycolytic enzymes and, judged Akt phosphorylation, insulin signaling. Importantly, diminished insulin signaling evident 1 wk high fat diet occur pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 knockout mice. Dietary intervention leads rapid decline pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 levels recovery pyruvate dehydrogenase activity indicating additional form regulation. Finally, overnight fast elicits metabolic response similar induced high dietary fat obscuring diet-induced metabolic changes. Thus, data indicate diet-induced inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase may initiating event decreased oxidation glucose increased reliance heart fatty acids energy production.
