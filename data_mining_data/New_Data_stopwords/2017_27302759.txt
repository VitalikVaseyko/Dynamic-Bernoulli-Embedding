 UNLABELLED: Clostridium tyrobutyricum Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium efficiently produces butyric acid considered promising host anaerobic production bulk chemicals. Due limited knowledge genetic metabolic characteristics strain, however, little progress made metabolic engineering strain. report complete genome sequence C. tyrobutyricum KCTC 5387 (ATCC 25755), consists 3.07-Mbp chromosome 63-kbp plasmid. results genomic analyses suggested C. tyrobutyricum produces butyrate butyryl-coenzyme (butyryl-CoA) acetate reassimilation CoA transferase, differently Clostridium acetobutylicum, uses phosphotransbutyrylase-butyrate kinase pathway; validated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) related genes, protein expression levels, vitro CoA transferase assay, fed-batch fermentation. addition, changes protein expression levels course batch fermentations glucose examined shotgun proteomics. Unlike C. acetobutylicum, expression levels proteins involved glycolytic fermentative pathways C. tyrobutyricum decrease even stationary phase. Proteins related energy conservation mechanisms, including Rnf complex, NfnAB, pyruvate-phosphate dikinase absent C. acetobutylicum, identified. features explain organism produce butyric acid much higher titer better tolerate toxic metabolites. study presenting complete genome sequence, global protein expression profiles, genome-based metabolic characteristics batch fermentation C. tyrobutyricum valuable designing strategies metabolic engineering strain. IMPORTANCE: Bio-based production chemicals renewable biomass become increasingly important due concerns climate change environmental problems. C. tyrobutyricum used efficient butyric acid production. order increase performance expand capabilities strain toward production chemicals, metabolic engineering needs performed. this, better understanding metabolic physiological characteristics bacterium genome level needed. work reporting results complete genomic proteomic analyses together new insights butyric acid biosynthetic pathway energy conservation allow development strategies metabolic engineering C. tyrobutyricum bio-based production various chemicals addition butyric acid.
