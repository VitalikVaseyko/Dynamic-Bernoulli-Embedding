 1. Previous studies showed activation pyruvate dehydrogenase within intact rat heart mitochondria pyruvate much diminished mitochondria starved diabetic animals [see Kerbey, Randle, Cooper, Whitehouse, Pask & Denton (1976) Biochem. J. 154, 327-348]. present study, diminished responses added Ca2+ ADP also found mitochondria. 2. Starvation diabetes affect mitochondrial respiratory control ratio ATP content. Moreover, starvation diabetes alter response intramitochondrial Ca2+-sensitive enzyme, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, changes extramitochondrial concentration Ca2+ 2-oxoglutarate, thus indicating appreciable changes distribution Ca2+ H+ across mitochondrial inner membrane. 3. Pyruvate, Ca2+ ADP found synergistic effects pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, particularly mitochondria starved diabetic rats. 4. results suggest effects diabetes starvation pyruvate dehydrogenase brought changes distribution effectors across mitochondrial inner membrane changes intrinsic sensitivity kinase phosphatase pyruvate dehydrogenase system pyruvate, Ca2+ ADP; rather probably increase maximum activity kinase relative phosphatase. 6. results also lend support hypothesis adrenaline may bring activation pyruvate dehydrogenase rat heart increase intramitochondrial concentration Ca2+.
