 Release 14C-serotonin human platelets prelabeled 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine measured platelet aggregation induced Staphylococcus aureus. Platelet-bacteria interaction (PBI) potent stimulus platelet release reaction collagen, thrombin, epinephrine. Inhibitors blocked platelet aggregation also prevented release reaction PBI. Sequential measurements release, correlated nephelometry aggregation, showed close correlation onset release onset platelet shape change early aggregation. Ultrastructural studies polylysine, agent capable polymerizing platelet granule contents, revealed granule components secreted region bacteria trapped platelets forming aggregates. Platelet peroxidase activity remained localized within dense tubular system platelets.
