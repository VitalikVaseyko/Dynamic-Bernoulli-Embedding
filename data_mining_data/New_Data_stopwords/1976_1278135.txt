 Sequential determinations serum enolase pyruvate kinase (PK) activities carried addition routine enzyme assays 191 patients admitted coronary care unit. upper reference values established 61 healthy laboratory staff members 21 U/1 enolase 76 U/1 PK. 99 patients confirmed diagnosis myocardial infarction (MI), 97 manifested raised serum enolase period observation; 85 patients raised serum PK. incidence raised values serum PK among patients considered sustained infarction similar shown routine enzymes, serum enolase activity much frequently raised patients. time-course elevation serum enolase also PK discussed relation changes serum enzymes routinely measured MI.
