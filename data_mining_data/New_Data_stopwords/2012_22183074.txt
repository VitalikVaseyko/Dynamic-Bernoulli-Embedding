 describe first case prenatal diagnosis pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency Chinese emphasize disease important differential diagnosis pediatric patients non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. Han Chinese child history severe transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia diagnosed PK deficiency. Prenatal diagnosis performed second child based genetic findings family. index patient compound heterozygous missense mutation (c.1073G > A. p.Gly358Glu) father large deletion (c.283 + 1914_c.1434del5006) mother. fetus simple heterozygote paternal mutation. Pregnancy allowed continue healthy baby born. Severe PK deficiency warranting prenatal diagnosis seen Han Chinese. Genetic characterization genotype-phenotype correlation studies PKLR different populations indicated better define role prenatal diagnosis PK deficiency.
