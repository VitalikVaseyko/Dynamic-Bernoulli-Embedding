 Lactate shuttled inside cells, playing metabolic signaling roles healthy tissues. Lactate also harbinger altered metabolism participates pathogenesis inflammation, hypoxia/ischemia, neurodegeneration cancer. Many tumor cells show high rates lactate production presence oxygen, phenomenon known Warburg effect, diagnostic possibly therapeutic implications. article introduce Laconic, genetically-encoded Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based lactate sensor designed bacterial transcription factor LldR. Laconic quantified lactate 1 microM 10 mM affected glucose, pyruvate, acetate, betahydroxybutyrate, glutamate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate oxalacetate concentrations found mammalian cytosol. Expressed astrocytes, HEK cells T98G glioma cells, sensor allowed dynamic estimation lactate levels single cells. Used combination blocker monocarboxylate transporter MCT, sensor capable discriminating whether cell net lactate producer net lactate consumer. Application MCT-block protocol showed basal rate lactate production 3-5 fold higher T98G glioma cells normal astrocytes. contrast, rate lactate accumulation response mitochondrial inhibition sodium azide 10 times lower glioma astrocytes, consistent defective tumor metabolism. ratio rate lactate production rate azide-induced lactate accumulation, estimated reversibly single cells, identified highly sensitive parameter Warburg effect, values 4.1 +/- 0.5 T98G glioma cells 0.07 +/- 0.007 astrocytes. summary, article describes genetically-encoded sensor lactate use measure lactate concentration, lactate flux, Warburg effect single mammalian cells.
