 new approach analysis hepatic metabolism burn injury introduced. Relative anaplerotic, pyruvate recycling gluconeogenic fluxes measured 13C NMR isotopomer analysis blood glucose rats 40% body surface area injury, rats exposed sham injury. short chain fatty acid, [U-13C] propionate avidly extracted liver, infused intravenously deliver 13C citric acid cycle. difference multiplets detected glucose carbon-2 (C-2) anomer blood liver 45 60 min infusion propionate, indicating steady-state isotopic conditions achieved. Gluconeogenesis relative citric acid cycle flux altered burn injury; sham burn groups rate glucose production equal flux citrate synthase. sham group animals rate entry carbon skeletons citric acid cycle four times citric acid cycle flux animals thermal injury. Similarly, flux pyruvate kinase (again relative citrate synthase) significantly increased burn injury.
