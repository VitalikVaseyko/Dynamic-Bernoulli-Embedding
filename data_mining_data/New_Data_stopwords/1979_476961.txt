 1. Maleic acid shown able bind thiol compound 2-mercaptoethanol. fully consistent data Morgan Friedman (1938). 2. Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase dissolved quantitated Tris-maleate shows loss positive homotropic interactions, compared preparation Tris-HCl. Hill coefficients (n) n = 1.0-1.2 n = 1.6-1.8 obtained Tris-maleate Tris-HCl respectively. Half saturation [S] 0.5 Vmax remain unchanged. Pyruvate kinase Tris-maleate slightly stable heating 60 degrees C Tris-HCl. Incubation enzyme Tris-maleate one h high concentrations dithiotreitol restores positive homotropic interactions. 3. proposed, abnormalities pyruvate kinase patients acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency, obtained study Tris-maleate, may partly induced buffer itself.
