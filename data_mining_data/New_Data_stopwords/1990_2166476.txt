 Complexes oxocation vanadyl(IV), VO2+, pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle investigated steady-state kinetic assays EPR spectroscopy. Pyruvate kinase requires 2 eq divalent cation activity. VO2+ alone poor activator normal physiological reaction catalyzed enzyme enzyme-catalyzed exchange methyl protons pyruvate solvent. VO2+ alone is, however, activator enzyme-catalyzed phosphorylation glycolate ATP. VO2+ effective Mg2+ activation bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reaction pyruvate kinase, enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis phosphoenolpyruvate. EPR data show VO2+ binds divalent cation site protein competitively respect Mg2+. VO2+-enzyme complex high affinity bicarbonate. Direct coordination pyruvate, oxalate, glycolate enzyme-bound VO2+ established EPR measurements specifically 17O-labeled forms compounds.
