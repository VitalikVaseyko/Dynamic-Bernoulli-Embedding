 Shc proteins interact insulin receptor, indicating role regulating glycolysis. investigate idea, activities key glycolytic regulatory enzymes metabolites levels measured skeletal muscle mice low levels Shc proteins (ShcKO) wild-type (WT) controls. activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1 pyruvate kinase decreased ShcKO versus WT mice fed fasted conditions. Increased alanine transaminase branched-chain amino acid transaminase activities also observed ShcKO mice fed fasting conditions. Protein expression glycolytic enzymes unchanged ShcKO WT mice, indicating decreased activities due changes transcription. Changes metabolite levels consistent observed changes enzyme activities. particular, levels fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, potent activator phosphofructokinase-1, consistently decreased ShcKO mice. Furthermore, levels lactate (inhibitor hexokinase phosphofructokinase-1) citrate (inhibitor phosphofructokinase-1 pyruvate kinase) increased fed fasted ShcKO versus WT mice. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity lower ShcKO versus WT mice fed conditions, showed inhibition fasting conditions ShcKO WT mice, ShcKO mice showing less inhibition WT mice. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 levels unchanged fed conditions lower ShcKO mice fasting conditions. studies indicate decreased levels Shc proteins skeletal muscle lead decreased glycolytic capacity fed fasted states.
