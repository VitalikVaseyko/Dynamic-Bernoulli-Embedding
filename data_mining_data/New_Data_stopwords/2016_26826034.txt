 Mitochondria play key role energy metabolism, hosting machinery oxidative phosphorylation, efficient cellular pathway generating ATP. major checkpoint process transport pyruvate produced cytosolic glycolysis mitochondrial matrix, accomplished recently identified mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). gatekeeper pyruvate entry mitochondria, MPC thought fundamental importance establishing metabolic programming cell. especially relevant context aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect, hallmark many types cancer, MPC loss function promotes cancer growth. Moreover, mitochondrial pyruvate uptake needed efficient hepatic gluconeogenesis regulation blood glucose levels. review discuss recent advances knowledge MPC, argue may offer promising target diseases like cancer type 2 diabetes. article part Special Issue entitled: Mitochondrial Channels edited Pierre Sonveaux, Pierre Maechler Jean-Claude Martinou.
