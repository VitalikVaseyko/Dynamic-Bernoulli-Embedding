 effect chronic sepsis concentration active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex investigated liver skeletal muscle normal, sterile inflammatory, chronic septic (small large abscess) animals. Hyperdynamic sepsis induced intraperitoneal introduction rat fecal-agar pellet known size bacterial composition (Escherichia coli + Bacteroides fragilis). Total pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity altered either liver skeletal muscle conditions studied. hepatic tissue, sterile inflammation increased proportion active complex 2.5-fold compared control. increase concentration active complex observed animals small abscess. abscess size increased (large abscess), concentration active complex decreased relative sterile inflammatory small abscess septic animals. contrast liver, sterile inflammation alter proportion active complex skeletal muscle. Sepsis (either small large septic abscess) resulted threefold decrease concentration active complex relative control sterile inflammatory animals. Changes concentration active complex appear dependent ATP/ADP concentration ratio tissue pyruvate levels consistent changes acetyl-coenzyme A-to-coenzyme concentration ratio. mechanism responsible altered concentration active complex may mediated changes activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, secondary alterations effector concentration ratios.
