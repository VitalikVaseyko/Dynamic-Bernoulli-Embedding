 Preferential expression low-activity (dimeric) M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PK) constitutively active splice variant M1 isoform considered critical aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. However, results reported indicate co-expression PKM1 PKM2 possible physical interaction cancer cells. show knockdown either PKM1 PKM2 differentially affects net PK activity, viability, cellular ATP levels lung carcinoma cell lines H1299 A549. stable knockdown PK isoforms A549 cells significantly reduced cellular ATP level, whereas H1299 cells level ATP unaltered. Interestingly, PKM1/2 knockdown H1299 cells activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis autophagy maintain energy homeostasis. contrast, knocking either PKM isoforms A549 cells lacking LKB1, serine/threonine protein kinase upstream AMPK, failed activate AMPK sustain energy homeostasis resulted apoptosis. Moreover, similar genetic background silenced PKM1 PKM2, knocking AMPKalpha1/2 catalytic subunit H1299 cells induced apoptosis. findings help explain previous targeting PKM2 cancer cells control tumor growth met expected success. suggest lack success AMPK-mediated energy metabolism rewiring, protecting cancer cell viability. basis observations, propose alternative therapeutic strategy silencing either PKM isoforms along AMPK tumors.
