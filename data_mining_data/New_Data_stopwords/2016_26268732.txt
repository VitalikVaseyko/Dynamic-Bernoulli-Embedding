 n-3 Long-chain PUFA up-regulate intestinal lipid metabolism. However, whether metabolic effects PUFA intestine mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) remains elucidated. determine effects alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) intestinal fatty acid (FA) metabolism whether effects affected AMPK deletion, mice deficient catalytic subunit AMPKalpha1 AMPKalpha2 wild-type (WT) mice fed either high-fat diet (HF) HF supplemented ALA (HF-A). results showed ALA supplementation decreased serum TAG content WT mice. ALA also increased mRNA expression genes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 4A10 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4a) involved intestinal lipid oxidation mRNA expression TAG synthesis-related genes (monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases 1 2) WT mice. Consistent these, expression levels phosphorylated AMPKalpha1 AMPKalpha2 also increased WT mice ALA addition. However, absence either AMPKalpha1 AMPKalpha2, ALA supplementation failed increase intestinal lipid oxidation. addition, significant effects either diet (HF HF-A) genotype (WT, AMPKalpha1(-/-) AMPKalpha2(-/-)) FA uptake intestine faecal TAG output observed. results suggest AMPK indispensable effects ALA intestinal lipid oxidation.
