 Winter survival many insects depends cold hardiness adaptations well entry hypometabolic diapause state minimizes energy expenditure. investigated whether AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) could involved adaptation larvae two cold-hardy insects, Eurosta solidaginis freeze tolerant Epiblema scudderiana uses freeze avoidance strategy. AMPK activity almost 2-fold higher winter larvae (February) compared animals collected September. Immunoblotting revealed phosphorylation AMPK activation loop phosphorylation acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), key target AMPK, higher Epiblema midwinter whereas seasonal change seen Eurosta. Immunoblotting also revealed significant increase ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation overwintering Epiblema larvae, Eurosta Epiblema, phosphorylation eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 dramatically increased winter. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) E1alpha subunit site 1 phosphorylation 2-fold higher extracts Eurosta larvae collected February versus September PDH activity decreased 50% Eurosta 80% February Eurosta larvae compared animals collected September. Glycogen phosphorylase phosphorylation 3-fold higher Epiblema larvae collected February compared September also animals, triglyceride lipase activity increased 70% winter. Overall, study suggests re-sculpting metabolism insect diapause, shifted catabolic poise freeze-avoiding overwintering Epiblema larvae, possibly involving AMPK.
