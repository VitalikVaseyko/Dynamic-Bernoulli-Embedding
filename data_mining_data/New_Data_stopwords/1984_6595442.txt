 histologic classification mouse liver tumors, i.e., hepatic nodules type 1 type 2 hepatocellular carcinomas, evaluated comparison several biologic biochemical markers shown useful grading tumor malignancy. liver tumors induced N,N'-2,7-fluorenylenebisacetamide (CAS: 304-28-9; N,N'-fluoren-2,7-ylenebisacetamide) administration male CD-1 mice. ability induce L-type pyruvate kinase activity response high-carbohydrate diet disappeared almost liver tumors. However, fairly good correlations observed histologic classification relative weights liver intraperitoneal fat pads, histologic classification level serum total cholesterol, histologic classification K-type pyruvate kinase activity. results suggest present histologic classification reflects degree tumor malignancy, therefore, would useful classification mouse liver tumors.
