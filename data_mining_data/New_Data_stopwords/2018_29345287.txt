 effect intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) cancer controversial. study, examined effects ICR food content syngeneic BALB/c mice injected CT26 mouse colon cancer cells. Mice subjected 24-h fasting week 4 weeks, provided control, high-calorie, trans fatty acid-rich diet. ICR resulted increases tumor weights, metastasis number cancer stem cells (CSCs) tumors blood mice fed control high-fat diets, effect body weight 4 weeks. particular, detected increases numbers CSCs tumor blood day starvation, food overconsumption detected. Conversely, continuous calorie restriction effect tumor weight, metastasis, number CSCs tumors blood. post-starvation period, energy metabolism tumor altered oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis/lactate fermentation, acquisition epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Hyperglycemia post-starvation period induced expression insulin-like growth factor-1, hypoxia-induced factor-1alpha Nanog, well phosphorylation Stat3. Taken together, findings suggest ICR induces increase number CSCs enhances EMT promoting Warburg/Crabtree effect following post-fasting food overconsumption.
