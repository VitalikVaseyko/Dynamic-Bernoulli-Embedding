 aim present study evaluate effect changes dietary protein level overall availability amino acids tissues. purpose, rats adapted diets containing various concentrations casein (7.5, 15, 30, 60%) sampled either postprandial postabsorptive period. rats fed protein-deficient diet, glucogenic amino acids (except threonine) tended accumulate plasma, liver, muscles. rats fed high-protein diets, hepatic balance glucogenic amino acids markedly enhanced liver concentrations consistently depressed. response result marked induction amino acid catabolism (a 45-fold increase liver threonine-serine dehydratase activity observed 60% casein diet). muscle concentrations threonine, serine, glycine underwent changes parallel plasma liver concentrations, significant reduction glutamine observed. postabsorptive period, adaptation high-protein diets resulted sustained catabolism glucogenic amino acids, accentuated drop concentrations (especially threonine) compartments studied. time course metabolic adaptation 60 15% casein diet also investigated. Adaptation alanine glutamine metabolism rapid, whereas threonine, serine, glycine delayed required 7-11 days. paralleled relatively slow decay liver threonine-serine dehydratase (T-SDH) activity contrast rapid adaptation pyruvate kinase activity refeeding high-carbohydrate diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
