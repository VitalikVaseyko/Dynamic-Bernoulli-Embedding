 aim review analyze results experimental research mechanisms regulation mitochondrial respiration cardiac skeletal muscle cells vivo obtained using permeabilized cell technique. analysis framework Molecular Systems Bioenergetics shows mechanisms regulation energy fluxes depend structural organization cells interaction mitochondria cytoskeletal elements. Two types cells cardiac phenotype different structures analyzed: adult cardiomyocytes continuously dividing cancerous HL-1 cells. cardiomyocytes mitochondria arranged regularly, show rapid configuration changes inner membrane fusion fission, diffusion ADP ATP restricted mostly level mitochondrial outer membrane due interaction heterodimeric tubulin voltage dependent anion channel, VDAC. VDAC associated tubulin forms supercomplex, Mitochondrial Interactosome, mitochondrial creatine kinase, MtCK, structurally functionally coupled ATP synthasome. Due selectively limited permeability VDAC adenine nucleotides, mitochondrial respiration rate depends almost linearly upon changes cytoplasmic ADP concentration physiological range. Functional coupling MtCK ATP synthasome amplifies signal recycling adenine nucleotides mitochondria coupled effective phosphocreatine synthesis. cancerous HL-1 cells complex significantly modified: tubulin replaced hexokinase MtCK lacking, resulting direct utilization mitochondrial ATP glycolytic lactate production way contributing mechanism Warburg effect. Systemic analysis changes integrated system energy metabolism also helpful better understanding pathogenesis many diseases.
