 colon cancer type 2 diabetes, metabolic changes induced upregulation Wnt/beta-catenin signaling downregulation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) may help account frequent association two diseases. diseases, PPAR gamma downregulated canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway upregulated. colon cancer, upregulation canonical Wnt system induces activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase deactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. result, large part cytosolic pyruvate converted lactate activation lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate extruded cell means activation monocarboxylate lactate transporter-1. phenomenon called Warburg effect. PPAR gamma agonists induce beta-catenin inhibition, inhibition canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activates PPAR gamma.
