 2-azidoadenine nucleotides show promise photoaffinity probes. Substitution C-2 position favor anti conformation enable binding analogue enzyme sites exhibit low affinity 8-azidoadenine derivatives. 2-azidoadenine nucleotides found substrates pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, adenylate kinase, hexokinase mitochondrial F1-ATPase. However, tautomerism 2-azidoadenine nucleotides two nonphotoreactive tetrazole forms complicates kinetic analyses use photoaffinity probes. analysis ultraviolet spectra analogues enables estimation tetrazolo isomer content rates tautomerization. photoreactive azido isomer found represent 45% total analogue population neutral aqueous solution. azidoazomethine-tetrazole equilibrium favors azido isomer acidic nonpolar solutions. first-order rate constants 25 degrees C determined 0.017 min-1 0.021 min-1 tautomerism azido tetrazolo isomers, respectively. Prior equilibration probe various solvents thus allows investigation analogue's behavior enzyme system different, essentially fixed, isomer ratios. determination impact tetrazolo tautomers system allows optimization conditions photoaffinity-labeling experiments.
