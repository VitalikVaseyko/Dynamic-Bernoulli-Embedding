 existence liver stem cell population gained credence recently, following results animal experiments. cells thought reside terminal bile ductules (canals Hering). Hepatocyte division responsible liver regeneration causes injury. However, stem cells may contribute hepatocyte regeneration, even take role liver injury severe associated impairment hepatocyte proliferation cirrhosis submassive/massive necrosis, due drugs, toxins viruses. "Oval" cells descendants stem cells found portal periportal regions experimental animals within days liver injury. cells proliferate form narrow ductules, may stain positively biliary cytokeratins CK 19, radiate damaged parenchyma. vitro vivo animal studies suggest oval cells differentiate bile ductular cells hepatocytes allow repopulation injured liver. oval cells differentiate hepatocytes may show positive staining pyruvate kinase isoenzyme L-PK, albumin alpha-fetoprotein. also growing evidence bone marrow stem cells may contribute liver regeneration. possible involvement hepatic stem cells development dysplastic nodules, hepatocellular carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma suggested remains highly controversial. Oval cell isolation culture techniques, together stem cell transplantation strategies, may future provide novel treatments individuals inherited acquired hepatic disorders.
