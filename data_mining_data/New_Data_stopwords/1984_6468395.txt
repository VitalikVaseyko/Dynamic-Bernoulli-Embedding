 Aerobic anoxic variants radular retractor muscle pyruvate kinase (PK-aerobic Pk-anoxic) gastropod mollusc, Busycotypus canaliculatum, purified homogeneity respective specific activities 368 186 mumol product min-1 mg protein-1. PK variants apparent homotetramers native molecular masses 235 kDa, differed several physical characteristics including pI (5.81 +/- 0.06 PK-aerobic, 5.42 +/- 0.03 PK-anoxic) chromatographic behavior several columns used respective purifications. two enzymes differed greatly several kinetic properties. Affinity phosphoenolpyruvate tenfold greater PK-aerobic (K0.5 = 0.067 +/- 0.002 mM; h = 0.99 +/- 0.10), whereas cooperative effect phosphoenolpyruvate binding greatly enhanced PK-anoxic (K0.5 = 0.85 +/- 0.02 mM, h = 2.57 +/- 0.01). Although affinities second substrate, ADP, identical enzyme forms (apparent Km = 0.25 mM) pK-anoxic showed greater substrate inhibition high concentrations ADP. Likewise, affinities K+ Mg2+ similar PK-anoxic showed greater degree cooperativity Mg2+ (h = 2.50 +/- 0.02) PK-aerobic (h = 1.70 +/- 0.06). Saturating concentrations fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (50 microM) activated PK-anoxic resulting enzyme properties similar fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-activated PK-aerobic, K0.5 values phosphoenolpyruvate 0.04 mM Hill coefficients 1.1. PK-anoxic showed much stronger regulation allosteric inhibitors MgATP, phenylalanine, proline alanine. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate partially relieved inhibitions ADP, MgATP, alanine, proline arginine phosphate enzyme forms. However, 0.1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate PK-aerobic much sensitive activation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, Ka values 0.05 +/- 0.01 microM PK-aerobic 1.3 +/- 0.1 microM PK-anoxic. presence 1.0 mM alanine 1.5 mM MgATP much higher concentrations fructose 1,6-bisphosphate required activation PK-anoxic (Ka = 5.2 +/- 0.4 microM) PK-aerobic (Ka = 0.02 +/- 0.01 microM). Variations pH range likely occurring vivo anaerobiosis caused significant additional kinetic differences two enzyme forms. dissimilarity kinetic properties PK-aerobic PK-anoxic indicate red muscle PK activity probably strongly depressed vivo anoxia stress.
