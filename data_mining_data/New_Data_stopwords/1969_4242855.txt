 1. Measurements made activities nine glycolytic enzymes epididymal adipose tissues obtained rats undergone one following treatments: starvation; starvation followed re-feeding bread high-fat diet; feeding fat without preliminary starvation; alloxan-diabetes; alloxan-diabetes followed insulin therapy. 2. general, activities glycolytic enzymes adipose tissue, unlike liver, greatly affected treatments. 3. ;key' glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, generally adaptive response physiological factors glycolytic enzymes glucose phosphate isomerase, fructose diphosphate aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. 4. Adiposetissue pyruvate kinase respond feeding fat manner similar liver enzyme. 5. Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase behaviour pattern unlike eight glycolytic enzymes studied activity depressed feeding fat restored normal re-feeding high-fat diet starvation. results discussed relation requirements adipose tissue glycerol phosphate esterification fatty acids. 6. statistical analysis results permitted writing linear equations describing relationships activities eight enzymes studied. 7. Evidence presented existence two constant-proportion groups amongst enzymes studied, namely (i) glucose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, (ii) triose phosphate isomerase, fructose diphosphate aldolase pyruvate kinase. 8. Mechanisms maintaining observed relationships activities enzymes tissue discussed.
