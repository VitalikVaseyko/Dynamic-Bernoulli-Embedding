 Phosphatidylserine (PS) normally localizes inner leaflet cell membranes becomes exposed abnormal apoptotic cells, signaling macrophages ingest them. Along similar lines, seemed possible removal red cells circulation normal aging hemolytic anemias might triggered PS exposure. investigate role PS exposure normal red cell aging, used N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin tag rabbit red cells vivo, used phycoerythrin-streptavidin label biotinylated cells, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) detect exposed PS. Flow cytometric analysis cells drawn 10-day intervals 70 days biotinylation indicated older, biotinylated cells expose PS. Furthermore, data match simple model red cell senescence assumes age-dependent destruction senescent red cells preceded several hours PS exposure random destruction red cells without PS exposure. using model, demonstrated exposure PS parallels rate biotinylated red cells removed circulation. hand, using annexin V-FITC label flow cytometry demonstrates exposed PS cause reduced red cell life span patients hemolytic anemia, possible exception unstable hemoglobins sickle cell anemia. Thus, cases PS exposure cell surface may signal removal red cells circulation, cases signal must trigger sequestration cells.
