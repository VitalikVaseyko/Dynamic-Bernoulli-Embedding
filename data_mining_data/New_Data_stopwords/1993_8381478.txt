 capacities viable colonic epithelial cells metabolize glucose, glutamine n-butyrate studied 30-kg pigs adapted high fiber (12% sugar beet fiber) low fiber diet. Glucose glutamine extensively utilized predominantly oxidized, whereas n-butyrate oxidation accounted 45% n-butyrate metabolism greatly affected presence glucose glutamine. diets, glycolysis major pathway accounting glucose disappearance. sparing effect n-butyrate glycolysis glucose oxidation. Moreover, glycolytic capacity 25% lower pigs fed high fiber diet. Data suggest 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase could regulatory step glycolysis. Nevertheless, maximum activity affected diet presence n-butyrate. Glutamine metabolism slightly affected fiber diet presence n-butyrate. addition CO2, butyrate converted ketone bodies. Glucose glutamine substantially alter n-butyrate metabolism. conclude metabolic features pig colonocytes, capacity oxidize n-butyrate, resemble rat human colonocytes. Moreover, characteristics, glycolytic capacity, modulated level fiber diet.
