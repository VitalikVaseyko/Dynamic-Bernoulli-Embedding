 Kidney cancer seventh common cancer Western world, incidence increasing, frequently metastatic presentation, stage patient survival statistics grim. addition, useful biofluid markers disease, diagnosis dependent imaging techniques generally used screening. present study, use metabolomics techniques identify metabolites kidney cancer patients' urine, appear different levels (when normalized account urine volume concentration) metabolites nonkidney cancer patients. found quinolinate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, gentisate differentially expressed false discovery rate 0.26, metabolites involved common pathways specific amino acid energetic metabolism, consistent high tumor protein breakdown utilization, Warburg effect. added four different (three kidney cancer-derived one "normal") cell lines, several significantly altered metabolites, quinolinate, alpha-ketoglutarate, gentisate, showed increased unchanged cell proliferation cell line-dependent. evaluation global metabolomics analysis, well confirmation specific potential biomarkers using larger sample size, lead new avenues kidney cancer diagnosis therapy.
