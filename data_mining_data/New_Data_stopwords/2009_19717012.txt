 Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) screened hypoglycemic liver-protective activity streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes established single dose STZ injection (45 mgkg(-1) bw, i.p.) 48h. CAPE injected doses 10, 20 30 microM kg(-1) bw day(-1) (i.p.) rats CAPEI, CAPEII CAPEIII groups 2 days induction diabetes continued 60 days, thereafter. found diabetes down-regulated expressions glucokinase (7.8-fold) pyruvate kinase (6.4-fold) comparison control, however, phoshoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels up-regulated 2.2-fold. CAPE treatments enhanced expressions glucokinase (3.4-14.9-folds), pyruvate kinase (3.2-12.8-folds) mRNAs diabetic rats. However, phoshoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA expression decreased CAPE varying degrees (1.2-5.5-fold). CAPE increased ( approximately 2-fold) level plasma insulin previously decreased STZ treatment. demonstrate CAPE significantly decreased fasting blood levels glucose, alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol, triglyceride induced diabetes. CAPE increased liver glycogen level lowered diabetes. histopathological evaluation liver, CAPE treatments seen reduce necrosis anisonucleosis hepatocytes, connective tissue elevated portal region diabetes. CAPE exhibits significant potential antidiabetic agent suppressing hepatic glucose output via inducing mRNA expression glucokinase pyruvate kinase, whilst inhibiting phoshoenolpyruvate carboxykinase diabetes. CAPE also ability decrease harmful effects diabetes liver rats.
