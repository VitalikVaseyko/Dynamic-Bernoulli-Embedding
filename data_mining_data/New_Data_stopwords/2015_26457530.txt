 Human carbonic anhydrase (CA; EC 4.2.1.1) isoform IX (CA IX) extracellular zinc metalloenzyme catalyzes reversible hydration CO2 HCO3(-), thereby playing role pH regulation. majority normal functioning cells exhibit low-level expression CA IX. However, cancer cells CA IX upregulated consequence metabolic transition known Warburg effect. upregulation CA IX cancer progression drawn interest potential therapeutic target. CA IX transmembrane protein, purification, yield crystallization proven challenging structure-based drug design, whereas closely related cytosolic soluble isoform CA II expressed crystallized ease. Therefore, utilized structural alignments site-directed mutagenesis engineer CA II mimics active site CA IX. paper, X-ray crystal structure CA IX mimic complex sucrose presented refined resolution 1.5 A, Rcryst 18.0% Rfree 21.2%. binding sucrose entrance active site CA IX mimic, CA II, non-inhibitory mechanism provides novel carbohydrate moiety binding site could exploited design isoform-specific inhibitors CA IX.
