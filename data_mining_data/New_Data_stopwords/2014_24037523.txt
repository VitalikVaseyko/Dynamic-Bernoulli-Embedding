 Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) serine/threonine protein kinase phosphorylates members conserved AGC kinase superfamily, including AKT protein kinase C (PKC), implicated important cellular processes including survival, metabolism tumorigenesis. large cohorts nevi melanoma samples, PDK1 expression significantly higher primary melanoma, compared nevi, increased metastatic melanoma. PDK1 expression suffices activity, owing auto-activation, elevated phosphorylation phosphoinositide 3'-OH-kinase (PI3K). Selective inactivation Pdk1 melanocytes Braf(V600E)::Pten(-/-) Braf(V600E)::Cdkn2a(-/-)::Pten(-/-) mice delayed development pigmented lesions melanoma induced systemic local administration 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Melanoma invasion metastasis significantly reduced completely prevented Pdk1 deletion. Administration PDK1 inhibitor GSK2334470 (PDKi) effectively delayed melanomagenesis metastasis Braf(V600E)::Pten(-/-) mice. Pdk1(-/-) melanomas exhibit marked decrease activity AKT, P70S6K PKC. Notably, PDKi effective inhibiting AGC kinases colony forming efficiency melanoma Pten wild-type (WT) genotypes. Gene expression analyses identified Pdk1-dependent changes FOXO3a-regulated genes, inhibition FOXO3a restored proliferation colony formation Pdk1(-/-) melanoma cells. studies provide direct genetic evidence importance PDK1, part FOXO3a-dependent pathway, melanoma development progression.
