 Amino-terminal analysis rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) failed detect presence free amino-terminal residues. Acetyl group analysis demonstrated presence 3.7 4.0 mol acetyl groups per mol enzyme. acetylated amino-terminal residue isolated pronase digests enzyme identified N-acetylserine. Quantitative recovery experiments indicated acetyl residues found amino termini. Carboxyl-terminal analyses using tritium exchange method suggested presence blocked carboxyl-terminal residue, supporting previous hydrazinolysis carboxypeptidase studies.
