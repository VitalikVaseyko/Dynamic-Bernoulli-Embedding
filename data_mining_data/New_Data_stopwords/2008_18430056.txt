 1. Glycerol used treatment intracranial hypertension, cerebral oedema glaucoma. Experimentally, intramuscular administration hypertonic glycerol solution used produce acute renal failure. model, glycerol causes rhabdomyolysis myoglobinuria, resulting development renal injury. pathogenesis thought involve vascular congestion, formation casts oxidative stress. However, effect glycerol independent rhabdomyolysis investigated. Therefore, aim present study investigate effects i.p. glycerol biochemical oxidative stress parameters kidney young rats. 2. Rats received 10 mL/kg, i.p., hypertonic glycerol solution (50% v/v) saline (NaCl 0.85 g%) followed 24 h water deprivation. Twenty-four hours administration glycerol, rats killed. Creatinine levels activity creatine kinase (CK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) determined plasma. addition, CK, pyruvate kinase LDH activity oxidative stress parameters (free radical formation, lipid peroxidation protein carbonylation) measured renal tissue. 3. Glycerol alter plasma CK activity increased plasma creatinine levels, suggesting renal insufficiency absence rhabdomyolysis. Renal CK pyruvate kinase activity decreased, suggesting diminution energy homeostasis kidney. Plasma renal LDH activity decreased, whereas formation free radicals, lipid peroxidation protein carbonylation increased, suggesting oxidative stress. 4. results similar described intramuscular administration glycerol. Therefore, possible glycerol may provoke renal lesions mechanisms induced rhabdomyolysis.
