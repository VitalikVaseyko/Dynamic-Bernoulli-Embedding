 OBJECTIVE: well documented oxidative stress basic mechanism behind development diabetic state. current study undertaken elucidate hypoglycemic role zinc, selenium vitamin E mixture comparison antidiabetic drug glibenclamide. MATERIALS METHODS: Male Wistar rats weighing 250 +/- 50 g made diabetic injection single i.p. dose streptozotocin (STZ) (65 mg/kg b. wt). Diabetic groups simultaneously i.p. injected either zinc chloride (ZnCI2) (5 mg/kg) selenium vitamin E (1.5 mg/kg sodium selenite vitamin E 1000 mg/kg) zinc, selenium vitamin E element i.p. injected according corresponding therapeutic dose daily one month. Another group orally treated daily glibenclamide drug (5 mg/kg) one month. RESULTS: Blood tissue samples collected day 3 post STZ injection (from one group serum glucose level significantly elevated < = 300, p < = 0.05) day 30 post-treatment groups. Liver function, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) significantly increased, superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), total protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) hexokinase (HK) inhibited STZ treatment. Histological examination diabetic liver showed necrosis degenerative changes hepatocytes. Treatment diabetic rats ZnCI2, selenium vitamin E combination blunted increment serum glucose induced STZ, preserved liver architecture ameliorated previous mentioned biochemical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: found that, combined administration zinc, selenium vitamin E exhibited remarkable effect either zinc selenium vitamin E. So, results clearly indicate beneficial effects micronutrients combination controlling hyperglycemia.
