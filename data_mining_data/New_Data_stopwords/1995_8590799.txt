 N-terminal sequence catalytic subunit fission yeast DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) contains two putative nuclear localization signals (NLS). check functionality signals vivo, N-terminal sequence experimentally divided three amino acid blocks, two contain distinct presumptive NLS. block deleted, either individually combination one two others. deleted gene products expressed fission yeast, assayed indirect immunofluorescence aptitude localize cell nucleus. Block II, contains putative NLS pentapeptide 97RKRKK, necessary sufficient promote nuclear import pol alpha, well pyruvate kinase fusion protein. Precise excision NLS pentapeptide block II inhibited nuclear import pol alpha, thus confirming role sequence functional NLS fission yeast enzyme.
