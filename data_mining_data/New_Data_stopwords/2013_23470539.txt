 metabolic properties cancer cells diverge significantly normal cells. Energy production cancer cells abnormally dependent aerobic glycolysis. addition dependency glycolysis, cancer cells atypical metabolic characteristics increased fatty acid synthesis increased rates glutamine metabolism. Emerging evidence shows many features characteristic cancer cells, dysregulated Warburg-like glucose metabolism, fatty acid synthesis glutaminolysis linked therapeutic resistance cancer treatment. Therefore, targeting cellular metabolism may improve response cancer therapeutics combination chemotherapeutic drugs cellular metabolism inhibitors may represent promising strategy overcome drug resistance cancer therapy. Recently, several review articles summarized anticancer targets metabolic pathways metabolic inhibitor-induced cell death pathways, however, dysregulated metabolism therapeutic resistance, highly clinical relevant area cancer metabolism research, specifically addressed. unique angle, review article discuss relationship dysregulated cellular metabolism cancer drug resistance targeting metabolic enzymes, glucose transporters, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, fatty acid synthase glutaminase enhance efficacy common therapeutic agents overcome resistance chemotherapy radiotherapy.
