 BACKGROUND: Antagonists relevant Gs protein-coupled agonists relevant Gi protein-coupled receptors lower renal cAMP inhibit growth renal cysts animal models human ARPKD (PCK rat) and/or ADPKD (Pkd2(-/WS25) mouse). calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) expressed various tubular segments couples Gq, thereby activating phospholipase Cgamma, InsP3 generation calcium mobilization intracellular stores, Gi proteins. mechanisms, CaR activation could lower intracellular cAMP inhibit renal cyst growth. METHODS: PCK rat Pkd2(-/WS25) mouse littermates fed rodent chow without R-568, type 2 calcimimetic, concentration 0.05% 0.1% 3 10 16 weeks age. Histomorphometric analysis performed Meta-Morph software. Western analysis immunohistochemical staining performed using antibodies aquaporin-2, urea transporter UT-A1 CaR. Northern blot hybridization used quantify expression vasopressin V2 receptor aquaporin 2 mRNAs. Cyclic AMP measured using enzyme immunoassay kit. RESULTS: R-568 effect kidney weight, cyst volume, plasma BUN concentration severity polycystic liver disease. significant reduction renal interstitial fibrosis detected PCK rats, Pkd2(-/WS25) mice. R-568 administration, anticipated, resulted hypocalcemia hyperphosphatemia, significant increases urine output, osmolar clearance, urinary excretions sodium, potassium calcium. CONCLUSIONS: CaR activation detectable effect cystogenesis models autosomal recessive dominant polycystic kidney disease. lack protective effect could due absence CaR outer medullary cortical collecting ducts, reduction extracellular calcium unaffected levels renal cAMP renal expression cAMP-dependent genes. possible beneficial effect interstitial fibrosis deserves study advanced stages disease.
