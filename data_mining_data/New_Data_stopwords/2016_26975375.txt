 Parkin, ubiquitin E3 ligase, mutated cases autosomal recessive early onset Parkinson disease. discovered Parkin also mutated glioblastoma human malignancies inhibits tumor cell growth. Here, identified pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) unique substrate parkin biochemical purification. found parkin interacts PKM2 vitro vivo, interaction dramatically increases glucose starvation. Ubiquitylation PKM2 parkin affect stability decreases enzymatic activity. Parkin regulates glycolysis pathway affects cell metabolism. studies revealed novel important roles parkin tumor cell metabolism provided new insight therapy Parkinson disease.
