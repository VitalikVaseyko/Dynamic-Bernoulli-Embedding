 Dysregulated splicing pre-messenger (m)RNA considered molecular occasion carcinogenesis. However, underlying mechanism complex remains investigated. Herein, report upregulated miR-92a reduced RNA-binding motif 4 (RBM4) protein expression, leading imbalanced expression neuronal polypyrimidine tract-binding (nPTB) protein alternative splicing-coupled nonsense mediated decay (NMD) mechanism. Increase nPTB protein enhances relative level fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 IIIc (FGFR2) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) transcripts contribute progression metabolic signature CRC cells. Expression profiles RBM4 downstream alternative splicing events consistently observed cancerous tissues compared adjacent normal tissues. results constitute mechanistic understanding RBM4 repressing carcinogenesis colorectal cells.
