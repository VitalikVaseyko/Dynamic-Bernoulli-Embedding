 studied effects fatty acid oxidation insulin secretion db/db mice underlying molecular mechanisms effects. 2-3 months age, db/db mice markedly obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic. Serum free fatty acid (FFA) levels increased 2-month-old (1.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P < 0.05) 3-month-old (1.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, P < 0.01) mice compared age sex-matched db/+ mice serving controls. Glucose-induced insulin release db/db islets markedly decreased compared db/+ islets specifically ameliorated (by 54% 2-month-old 38% 3-month-old mice) exposure carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor, etomoxir (1 micromol/l). Etomoxir failed affect insulin response alpha-ketoisocaproate. effect etomoxir glucose-induced insulin release lost culturing db/db islets RPMI medium containing 22 mmol/l glucose fatty acid. Culture db/+ islets 0.125 mmol/l palmitate led decrease glucose-induced insulin secretion, partially reversible etomoxir. islet glucose oxidation ratio glucose oxidation utilization decreased db/db islets. Etomoxir significantly enhanced glucose oxidation 60% also ratio oxidation glucose utilization (from 27 +/- 2.5 37 +/-3.0%, P < 0.05). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity decreased islets db/db mice (75 +/-4.2 vs. 91 +/- 2.9 nU/ng DNA, P < 0.01), whereas PDH kinase activity increased (rate PDH inactivation -0.25 +/- 0.02 vs. - 0.11 +/- 0.02/min, P < 0.0 1). abnormalities partly wholly reversed 2-h preexposure etomoxir. conclusion, elevated FFA levels db/db mouse diminish glucose-induced insulin secretion glucose-fatty acid cycle fatty acid oxidation inhibits glucose oxidation decreasing PDH activity increasing PDH kinase activities.
