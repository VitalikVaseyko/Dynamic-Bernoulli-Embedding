 examined possible influence bovine pancreatic polypeptide (bPP) glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis hepatocytes isolated fed rats. activity glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate kinase, enzymes implicated hormonal regulation pathways, also measured. Glycogenolysis estimated glucose release medium gluconeogenesis (U-14C) pyruvate incorporation glucose. Addition bPP incubation medium modify endogenous glucose production glycogen phosphorylase activity, either basal conditions stimulation glucagon (3 x 10(-10) M) phenylephrine (10(-5) M). bPP also failed alter incorporation rate (U-14 C) pyruvate glucose pyruvate kinase activity, basal conditions well presence glucagon. Furthermore, time-course experiments revealed effect bPP glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate kinase activities. data indicate pancreatic polypeptide implicated control glucose production isolated liver cells fed rats.
