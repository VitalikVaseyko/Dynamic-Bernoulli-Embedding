 Genetic engineering metabolic pathways standard strategy increase production metabolites economic interest. However, flux increases could likely lead undesirable changes metabolite concentrations, producing deleterious perturbations cellular processes. negative effects could avoided implementing balanced increase enzyme concentrations according Universal Method [Kacser Acerenza (1993) Eur J Biochem 216:361-367]. Exact application method usually requires modification many reactions, difficult achieve practice. Here, improvement threonine production via pyruvate kinase deletion Escherichia coli used case study demonstrate partial application Universal Method, includes performing sensitivity analysis. analysis predicts manipulating reactions sufficient obtain important increase threonine production without major perturbations metabolite concentrations.
