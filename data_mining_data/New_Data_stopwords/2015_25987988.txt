 Solid cancers hematologic cancers frequently colonize bone induce skeletal-related complications. Bone pain one common complications associated cancer colonization bone major cause increased morbidity diminished quality life, leading poor survival cancer patients. Although mechanisms responsible cancer-associated bone pain (CABP) poorly understood, likely complex interactions among cancer cells, bone cells peripheral nerve cells contribute pathophysiology CABP. Clinical observations specific inhibitors osteoclasts reduce CABP indicate critical role osteoclasts. Osteoclasts proton-secreting cells acidify extracellular bone microenvironment. Cancer cell-colonized bone also releases proton/lactate avoid intracellular acidification resulting increased aerobic glycolysis known Warburg effect. Thus, extracellular microenvironment cancer-colonized bone acidic. Acidosis algogenic nociceptive sensory neurons. bone densely innervated sensory neurons express acid-sensing nociceptors. Collectively, CABP evoked activation nociceptors sensory neurons innervating bone acidic extracellular microenvironment created bone-resorbing osteoclasts bone-colonizing cancer cells. current treatments satisfactorily control CABP elicit serious side effects, new therapeutic interventions needed manage CABP. Understanding cellular molecular mechanism acidic extracellular microenvironment created cancer-colonized bone expression function acid-sensing nociceptors sensory neurons regulated would facilitate develop novel therapeutic approaches management CABP.
