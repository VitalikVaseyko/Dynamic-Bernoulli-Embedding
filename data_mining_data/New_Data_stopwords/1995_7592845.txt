 shown previously (Nishimura, M., Fedorov, S., Uyeda, K. (1994) (J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26100-26106) administration high concentrations glucose stimulates dephosphorylation Fru-6-P,2-kinase: Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase perfused liver, xylulose (Xu) 5-P activates dephosphorylation reaction. characterize protein phosphatase, purified Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase homogeneity livers rats injected high glucose. Several protein phosphatases livers separated DEAE-cellulose chromatography, one peak enzyme activated Xu 5-P. protein phosphatase inhibited okadaic acid (IC50 = 1-3 nM) require Mg2+ Ca2+, suggesting enzyme type 2A. enzyme heterotrimer (M(r) = 150,000) consisted structural (A, 65 kDa) catalytic (C, 36 kDa), regulatory (B, 52 kDa) subunits. Amino acid sequences five tryptic peptides derived B subunit showed similarity B alpha isoform rat protein phosphatase 2A, five 73 residues different. protein phosphatase catalyzed dephosphorylation Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase, phosphorylase alpha, pyruvate kinase, Km values 0.8 microM, 3.7 microM, 2.2 microM, respectively. Among substrates dephosphorylation bifunctional enzyme activated Xu 5-P, K alpha value Xu 5-P 20 microM. Xu 5-P sugar phosphate activated PP2A among sugar phosphates examined. results demonstrated existence isolation unique heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A rat liver catalyzed dephosphorylation Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase activated specifically Xu 5-P. Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase 2A explains increased Fru 2,6-P2 level liver high glucose administration.
