 Clinical trials revealed limited response duration glioblastomas VEGF-neutralizing antibody bevacizumab. Thriving devascularized microenvironment occurring antiangiogenic therapy requires tumor cell adaptation decreased glucose, 50% less glucose identified bevacizumab-treated xenografts. Compared bevacizumab-responsive xenograft cells, resistant cells exhibited increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, (13)C NMR pyruvate lactate conversion, survival low glucose. Glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) upregulated bevacizumab-resistant versus sensitive xenografts patient specimens HIF-1alpha-dependent manner. Resistant versus sensitive cell mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation-selective conditions produced less ATP. Despite unchanged mitochondrial numbers, normoxic resistant cells lower mitochondrial membrane potential sensitive cells, confirming poorer mitochondrial health, avoided mitochondrial dysfunction hypoxic sensitive cells. Thin-layer chromatography revealed increased triglycerides bevacizumab-resistant versus sensitive xenografts, change driven mitochondrial stress. glycogen synthase kinase-3beta inhibitor suppressing GLUT3 transcription caused greater cell death bevacizumab-resistant -responsive cells. Overexpressing GLUT3 tumor cells recapitulated bevacizumab-resistant cell features: survival proliferation low glucose, increased glycolysis, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, rapid vivo proliferation slowed bevacizumab untreated bevacizumab-responsive tumors. Targeting GLUT3 increased glycolysis reliance resistant tumors could unlock potential antiangiogenic treatments.
