 Cisplatin activates multiple signal transduction pathways associated cell survival apoptosis various cell types. present study undertaken determine role extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), member mitogen-activated protein kinase family, cisplatin-induced apoptosis human glioma cells. Cisplatin resulted apoptosis dose- time-dependent manner. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis prevented hydrogen peroxide scavenger pyruvate antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, superoxide scavenger tiron. Western blot analysis demonstrated cisplatin treatment induced time-dependent activation ERK, inhibited chemical inhibitors MEK signaling pathway (PD98059 U0126) N-acetylcysteine. inhibitors prevented cisplatin-induced cell death. Transient transfection constitutive active MEK1 increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Cisplatin resulted reduction mitochondrial membrane potential effect prevented N-acetylcysteine PD98059. Caspase inhibitors (Boc-D-FMK zDEVD-FMK) protected cisplatin-induced cell death. Cisplatin-induced activation caspase-3 inhibited N-acetylcysteine PD98059. Taken together, findings suggest ERK activation plays active role mediating cisplatin-induced apoptosis human glioma cells functions upstream mitochondrial dysfunction caspase activation initiate apoptotic signal.
