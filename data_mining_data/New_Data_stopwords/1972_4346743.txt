 1. Two different gels prepared suitable separation number enzymes, particular NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenases, affinity chromatography. matrix used Sepharose 4B. preparation (a), NAD(+)-Sepharose, 6-aminohexanoic acid coupled gel cyanogen bromide method NAD(+) attached using dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide; preparation (b), AMP-Sepharose, N(6)-(6-aminohexyl)-AMP coupled directly cyanogen bromide-activated gel. 2. Affinity columns gels retain two enzymes mixture bovine serum albumin, lactate dehydrogenase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase applied. Subsequent elution cofactor NAD(+) yields glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase whereas lactate dehydrogenase eluted applying molarity reduced cofactor. 3. binding glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase gel tested, AMP-Sepharose, strong enough resist elution gradients KCl least 0.5m. 0.0-0.15m gradient competitive inhibitor salicylate, however, elutes enzymes efficiently separately. 4. elution efficiency lactate dehydrogenase AMP-Sepharose examined using series eluents comparable conditions concentration etc. approximate relative efficiencies are: 0 (lactate); 0 (lactate+semicarbazide); 0 (0.5mm-NAD(+)); 80 (lactate+NAD(+)); 95 (lactate+semicarbazide+NAD(+)); 100 (0.5mm-NADH). 5. contaminating lactate dehydrogenase activity removed commercially available crude pyruvate kinase single-step procedure using AMP-Sepharose.
