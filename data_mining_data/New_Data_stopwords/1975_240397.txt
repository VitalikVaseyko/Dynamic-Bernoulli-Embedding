 2-Phospho-3-butenoic acid synthesized found substrate yeast rabbit muscle enolase (EC 4.2.1.11). Enolase catalyzes isomerization 2-phospho-3-butenoic acid (Z)-phosphoenol-alpha-ketobutyrate, beta,gamma-alpha,beta isomerization. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies product indicate one isomer formed. reaction provides indirect evidence support carbanion intermediate enolase reaction. 2-Phospho-3-butenoic acid also good competitive inhibitor yeast rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40).
