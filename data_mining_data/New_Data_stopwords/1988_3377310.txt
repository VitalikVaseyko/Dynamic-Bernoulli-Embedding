 Plasma pyruvate kinase (PK) creatine kinase (CK) activities increased significantly (P less 0.001 P less 0.05, respectively) homozygote halothane-reacting pigs (nn), compared activities homozygote nonreacting pigs (NN). Pyruvate kinase activity less variable within groups CK activity, allowing effective discrimination nn NN geno-types. PK CK activities plasma increase age halothane-reacting pigs nonreacting pigs. Enzyme activities heterozygote (Nn) nonreacting pigs differ significantly (P greater 0.05) enzyme activities homozygote (NN) nonreacting pigs. Although PK better CK identifying stress-susceptible pigs, age-related effects failure identify heterozygotes may restrict use plasma PK activity diagnostic test stress syndrome.
