 2-yr old girl hemolytic anemia present since birth requiring multiple blood transfusions. Pyruvate kinase deficiency suspected basis marginal enzyme activity, could established due presence massive numbers donor cells peripheral blood. However, density fractionation succeeded isolation small fraction patient's cells, severe pyruvate kinase deficiency could detected. contrast hexokinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities extremely high, indicative immature cell population present fraction. immunofluorescence studies clear crossreaction apparent anti M2-type pyruvate kinase antibodies, whereas faint reaction anti L-type could detected. Despite presence slight amount L-type immunoreactive material, residual activity patient's cell fraction could attributed M2-type pyruvate kinase shown cellulose acetate electrophoresis.
