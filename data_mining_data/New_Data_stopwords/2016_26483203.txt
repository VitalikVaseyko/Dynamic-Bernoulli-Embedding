 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase PDK1 metabolic enzyme responsible switching glucose metabolism mitochondrial oxidation aerobic glycolysis cancer cells, general hallmark malignancy termed Warburg effect. Herein report identification JX06 selective covalent inhibitor PDK1 cells. JX06 forms disulfide bond thiol group conserved cysteine residue (C240) based recognition hydrophobic pocket adjacent ATP pocket PDK1 enzyme. investigations JX06 mechanism suggested covalent modification C240 induced conformational changes Arginine 286 Van der Waals forces, thereby hindering access ATP binding pocket turn impairing PDK1 enzymatic activity. Notably, cells higher dependency glycolysis sensitive PDK1 inhibition, reflecting metabolic shift promoted cellular oxidative stress apoptosis. findings offer new mechanistic insights including therapeutically target PDK1 covalently modifying C240 residue.
