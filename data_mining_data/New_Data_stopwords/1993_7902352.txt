 Fasted rats intragastrically infused either [2,3-13C]lactate [1,2,3-13C]lactate. infusate also contained 14C-labeled lactate [3-3H]glucose. Glucose, alanine, glutamate, glutamine isolated liver blood. near complete equilibration lactate alanine, relative specific activities relative enrichments blood liver. Glucose cleaved enzymatically lactate. compounds examined gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. mass isotopomer spectra lactate, glutamate, glutamine cleavage fragments positional isotopomer composition compounds obtained. enrichment isotopomer pattern lactate cleaved glucose represents phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). [1,2,3-13C]lactate infused mass isotopomer spectrum glutamates consisted compounds containing either one, two, three 13C carbons per molecule (m1, m2, m3). little 13C C-4 C-5 glutamate. rate pyruvate decarboxylation low, 3-4% acetyl-CoA flux Krebs cycle contributed lactate carbon. major isotopomers lactate, alanine, PEP m3 m2 13C C-2 C-3. predominant isotopomer PEP [2,3-13C]lactate m2 13C C-2 C-3. much m1 isotopomer 13C C-3 C-2 m1 isotopomer 13C C-1. little m3, isotopomer 13C three carbons. 13C C-3 C-4 glucose C-1 glutamate introduced via 13CO2 fixation. isotopomer distribution rate glucose turnover deduced, applying analysis described "Appendix," absolute rates gluconeogenic pathways, recycling PEP Cori cycle, flux Krebs cycle. flux oxaloacetate (OAA)-->PEP seven times OAA-->citrate, half PEP recycled pyruvate via pyruvate kinase. mass isotopomer patterns glutamate glutamine similar differed lactate glucose. appears glutamates derived alpha-ketoglutarate different Krebs cycle pool PEP. flux OAA PEP pool two three times OAA citrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
