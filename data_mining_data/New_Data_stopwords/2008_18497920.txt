 report fuel generation systems molecular motors based pyruvate kinase, first time, mitochondria, implemented within microfluidic devices. Intact organelles acted bio-nanopower supplies molecular motors, using isolated mitochondria convert chemical energy succinate ATP, harnessing nature's enzymatic transformation cascades directly. Motors activated essentially equally ATP produced pyruvate kinase, mitochondria, direct addition ATP.
