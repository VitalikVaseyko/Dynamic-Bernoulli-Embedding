 Fuel metabolism highly regulated ensure adequate energy cellular function. contribution major metabolic fuels--glucose, lactate fatty acids (FAs)--often reflects circulating levels. addition, regulatory cross-talk fuel-induced hormone secretion ensures appropriate co-ordinate fuel utilization. activity either determine reflect fuel preference (carbohydrate versus fat), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) occupies pivotal position fuel cross-talk. Active PDC permits glucose oxidation allows formation mitochondrially derived intermediates (e.g. malonyl-CoA citrate) reflect fuel abundance. FA oxidation suppresses PDC activity. PDC inactivation phosphorylation catalysed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) 1-4, regulated differentially metabolite effectors. tissues contain least two often three PDK isoforms. develop hypothesis PDK4 "lipid status"-responsive PDK isoform facilitating FA oxidation signalling citrate formation. Substrate interactions level gene transcription extend glucose-FA interactions longer term. discuss potential targets substrate-mediated transcriptional regulation relation selective PDK isoform expression influence altered PDK isoform expression fuel sensing, selection utilization.
