 1-Carboxyallenyl phosphate, allenic homologue phosphoenolpyruvate, synthesized six steps. key step synthesis isomerization methyl 2-hydroxy-3-butynoate corresponding allenol phosphorylation material. allene excellent substrate pyruvate kinase, undergoing reaction half rate phosphoenolpyruvate. allene also substrate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, hydrolyzed enzyme rather carboxylated. enzymes, organic product 2-oxo-3-butenoate, gradually inactivates enzymes reaction one sulfhydryl groups active site.
