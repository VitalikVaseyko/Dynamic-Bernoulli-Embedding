 Experimental designs used monitor magnitude allosteric response greatly influence observed values. report impact buffer, monovalent cation, divalent cation, anion magnitude allosteric regulation affinity human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). magnitudes allosteric activation fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP) allosteric inhibition alanine independent most, buffers tested. However, magnitudes dependent whether Mg(2+) Mn(2+) included divalent cation. presence Mn(2+), change K(app-PEP) caused Fru-1,6-BP minimal. hL-PYK activity appear require monovalent cation. Monovalent cation binding active site impacts PEP affinity minimum influence magnitude allosteric coupling. However, Na(+) Li(+) reduce magnitude allosteric response Fru-1,6-BP, likely due mechanisms outside active site. anion used maintain constant monovalent cation concentration also influences magnitude allosteric response. value determining impact ions allosteric function appreciated considering representative structures used comparative studies often determined using protein crystals grown diverse buffer salt conditions.
