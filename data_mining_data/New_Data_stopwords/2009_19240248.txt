 Tumor-derived proteins may occur circulation result secretion, shedding cell surface, cell turnover. applied in-depth comprehensive proteomic strategy plasma intestinal tumor-bearing Apc mutant mice identify proteins associated tumor development. used quantitative tandem mass spectrometry fractionated mouse plasma identify differentially expressed proteins plasma intestinal tumor-bearing Apc mutant mice relative matched controls. Up-regulated proteins assessed expression corresponding genes tumor tissue. subset proteins implicated colorectal cancer selected analysis tissue level using antibody microarrays, Western blotting, tumor immunohistochemistry, novel fluorescent imaging. identified 51 proteins elevated plasma concordant up-regulation RNA level tumor tissue. list included multiple proteins involved colon cancer pathogenesis: cathepsin B cathepsin D, cullin 1, Parkinson disease 7, muscle pyruvate kinase, Ran. these, Parkinson disease 7, muscle pyruvate kinase, Ran also found up-regulated human colon adenoma samples. identified proteins direct relevance colorectal carcinogenesis present plasma tumor tissue intestinal tumor-bearing mice. results show integrated analysis plasma proteome tumor transcriptome genetically engineered mouse models powerful approach identification tumor-related plasma proteins.
