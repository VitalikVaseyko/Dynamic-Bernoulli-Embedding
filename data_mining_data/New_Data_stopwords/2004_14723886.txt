 Thyroid hormones (TH) pleiotropic factors important many developmental physiological functions vertebrates particularly amphibian metamorphosis. effects mediated two specific receptors (TRalpha TRbeta), ligand-dependent transcription factors, members nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Besides pivotal role amphibian metamorphosis, TH also critical fish metamorphosis. later role TH less studied, analyzed action turbot (Scophtalmus maximus), metamorphosing flat fish. describe isolation sequences turbot orthologs number Xenopus genes, induced amphibian metamorphosis. Developmental expression genes turbot metamorphosis studied several methods expression patterns genes compared Xenopus flounder. find period onset end eye migration (day 22 day 30 post-hatching) likely corresponds metamorphic climax either high TRalpha high TH levels. results show contrast amphibians, TRalpha TRbeta mRNA up-regulated metamorphosis. results highlight notion TH regulates, rise TR expression, genetic cascade turbot metamorphosis. fact TH regulates metamorphosis amphibian teleost fishes suggests TH-regulated metamorphosis post-embryonic process conserved vertebrates.
