 study, possible adverse effects pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency maturation erythroid progenitors investigated. 4-year-old Japanese girl severe PK deficiency underwent splenectomy reduce need blood transfusions. spleen examined histologically, hematopoietic progenitors spleen assayed evaluate extramedullary hematopoiesis PK-deficient subject. number hematopoietic progenitors including CFU-GM, BFU-E CFU-GEMM spleen PK-deficient patient much higher found control spleens, indicating enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis. TUNEL assay demonstrated apoptotic cells splenic red pulp PK-deficient patient. expression 7A6 antigen detected cells isolated spleen cells cultured vitro, cells positive glycophorin A. results provide evidence metabolic disturbances PK deficiency affect survival red cells also maturation erythroid progenitors, results premature cell death, i.e., apoptosis.
