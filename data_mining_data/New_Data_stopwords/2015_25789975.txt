 LincRNA-p21 long noncoding RNA transcriptional target p53 HIF-1alpha. LincRNA-p21 regulates gene expression cis trans, mRNA translation, protein stability, Warburg effect, p53-dependent apoptosis cell cycle arrest doxorubicin-treated mouse embryo fibroblasts. p53 plays key role response skin keratinocytes UVB-induced DNA damage inducing cell cycle arrest apoptosis. skin cancer development, UVB-induced mutation p53 allows keratinocytes upon successive UVB exposures evade apoptosis cell cycle arrest. hypothesized lincRNA-p21 key functional role UVB-induced apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest keratinocytes loss lincRNA-p21 function results evasion apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest. observed lincRNA-p21 transcripts highly inducible UVB mouse human keratinocytes culture mouse skin vivo. LincRNA-p21 regulated transcriptional level response UVB, UVB induction lincRNA-p21 keratinocytes vivo mouse epidermis primarily p53-dependent pathway. Knockdown lincRNA-p21 blocked UVB-induced apoptosis mouse human keratinocytes, lincRNA-p21 responsible majority UVB-induced p53-mediated apoptosis keratinocytes. Knockdown lincRNA-p21 effect cell proliferation untreated UVB-treated keratinocytes. early event skin cancer mutation single p53 allele. observed mutant p53(+/R172H) allele expressed mouse epidermis (K5Cre(+/tg);LSLp53(+/R172H)) showed significant dominant-negative inhibitory effect UVB-induced lincRNA-p21 transcription apoptosis epidermis. conclude lincRNA-p21 highly inducible UVB key role triggering UVB-induced apoptotic death. propose mutation single p53 allele provides pro-oncogenic function early skin cancer development dominant inhibitory effect UVB-induced lincRNA-p21 expression subsequent evasion UVB-induced apoptosis.
