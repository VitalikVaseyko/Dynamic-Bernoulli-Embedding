 aim work describe photosynthetic carbon metabolism cooltemperate C4 grass Spartina anglica. exception pyruvate, phosphate dikinase pyruvate kinase, maximum catalytic activities leaves putative enzymes C4 cycle phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase C4 plant considerably excess observed, steady-state rate photosynthesis, comparable maximum catalytic activities key enzymes reductive pentose-phosphate pathway. Radioactive carbon (14)CO2 supplied attached leaves steady-state photosynthesis appeared first malate aspartate moved intermediates reductive pentose-phosphate pathway, sucrose. experiments show photosynthetic carbon metabolism cool-temperate C4 plant similar C4 plants hotter climates.
