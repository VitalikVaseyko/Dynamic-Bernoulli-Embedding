 Metastases remain major cause death cancer. Recent molecular advances highlighted importance metabolic alterations cancer cells, including Warburg effect describes increased glycolysis cancer cells. However, altered metabolism contributes tumour metastasis remains elusive. Here, report phosphorylation-induced activation lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), enzyme catalyses interconversion pyruvate lactate, promotes cancer cell invasion, anoikis resistance tumour metastasis. demonstrate LDHA phosphorylated tyrosine 10 upstream kinases, HER2 Src. Targeting HER2 Src attenuated LDH activity well invasive potential head neck cancer breast cancer cells. Inhibition LDH activity small hairpin ribonucleic acid expression phospho-deficient LDHA Y10F sensitized cancer cells anoikis induction resulted attenuated cell invasion elevated reactive oxygen species, whereas phenotypes reversed product lactate antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, suggesting Y10 phosphorylation-mediated LDHA activity promotes cancer cell invasion anoikis resistance redox homeostasis. addition, LDHA knockdown LDHA Y10F rescue expression human cancer cells resulted decreased tumour metastasis xenograft mice. Furthermore, LDHA phosphorylation Y10 positively correlated progression metastatic breast cancer clinical patient tumour samples. findings demonstrate LDHA phosphorylation activation provide pro-invasive, anti-anoikis pro-metastatic advantages cancer cells, suggesting Y10 phosphorylation LDHA may represent promising therapeutic target prognostic marker metastatic human cancers.
