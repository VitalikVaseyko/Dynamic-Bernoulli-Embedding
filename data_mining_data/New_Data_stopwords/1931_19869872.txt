 present paper given results studies respiratory glycolytic metabolism Pneumococcus Types I, II, III, R forms derived these. metabolism R forms compared, relationship changes virulence, changes chemical constitution, changes metabolism discussed. 1. respiration Ringer solution unless sugar added. 2. pH (7.8) optimal growth pneumococcus also pH maximum respiration occurs. 3. intensity respiration varies type strains used. respiratory capacity Type 56 per cent Type III, turn 71 per cent Type II. 4. anaerobic glycolysis approximately three groups. 5. Pneumococcus Type capable aerobic glycolysis. 6. Pneumococcus Types II III effect glycolysis aerobically. 7. energy set free respiration considerably greater set free glycolysis. 8. oxidation quotient lactic acid order found Meyerhof muscle Warburg mammalian tissues. 9. respiratory capacities Types III changed conversion smooth rough form. (a) Type respiration increased 110 per cent. (b) Type III respiration diminished 45 per cent. (c) Type II slight diminution respiratory activity (16 per cent). 10. anaerobic glycolysis increased 25 per cent average R forms irrespective type derivation. 11. Type converted R form, loses capacity aerobic glycolysis. 12. Type III, converted R form, gains capacity aerobic glycolysis. 13. oxygen consumption Pneumococcus compared human tubercle bacillus mammalian tissue, time intervals, weight weight, follows: (a) Pneumococcus Type consumes thirteen times much oxygen tubercle bacillus (H37). (b) Pneumococcus Type II consumes thirty-four times much oxygen tubercle bacillus. (c) Pneumococcus Type II consumes twenty times much oxygen isolated rat kidney tissue, almost 100 times much oxygen isolated dog muscle.
