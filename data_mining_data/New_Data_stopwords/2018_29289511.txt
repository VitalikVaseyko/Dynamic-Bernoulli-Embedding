 Enhancement aerobic glycolysis suppression mitochondrial metabolism characterize pro-proliferative Warburg phenotype cancer cells. High free tubulin cancer cells closes voltage dependent anion channels (VDAC) decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi), effect antagonized erastin, canonical promotor ferroptosis. Previously, identified six compounds (X1-X6) also block tubulin-dependent mitochondrial depolarization. Here, hypothesized VDAC opening erastin X1-X6 increases mitochondrial metabolism reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, leading ROS-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic failure cell death. Accordingly, characterized erastin two potent structurally unrelated lead compounds, X1 X4, ROS formation, mitochondrial function cell viability. Erastin, X1 X4 increased DeltaPsi followed closely increase mitochondrial ROS generation within 30-60min. Subsequently, mitochondria began depolarize hour longer indicative mitochondrial dysfunction. N-acetylcysteine (NAC, glutathione precursor ROS scavenger) MitoQ (mitochondrially targeted antioxidant) blocked increased ROS formation X1 prevented mitochondrial dysfunction. Erastin, X1 X4 selectively promoted cell killing HepG2 Huh7 human hepatocarcinoma cells compared primary rat hepatocytes. X1 X4-dependent cell death blocked NAC. results suggest ferroptosis induced erastin erastin-like lead compounds caused VDAC opening, leading increased DeltaPsi, mitochondrial ROS generation oxidative stress-induced cell death.
