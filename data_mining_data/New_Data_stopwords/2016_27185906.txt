 Interleukin (IL)-6 released skeletal muscle (SkM) exercise shown affect hepatic metabolism. is, however, unknown whether SkM IL-6 involved regulation exercise training-induced counteraction changes carbohydrate lipid metabolism liver response high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Male SkM-specific IL-6 KO (MKO) Floxed mice subjected Chow diet, HFD HFD combined exercise training (HFD ExTr) 16 weeks. Hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) protein content decreased HFD HFD ExTr Floxed mice, increased IL-6 MKO mice HFD addition, intrahepatic glucose concentration IL-6 MKO mice higher HFD chow. Within HFD ExTr mice, hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) 36 kDa protein content higher IL-6 MKO Floxed mice. Hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4 PDK2 protein content Floxed mice lower HFD ExTr Chow. addition, hepatic ACC1-phosphorylation higher ACC1 protein lower HFD Together suggests SkM IL-6 regulates hepatic glucose metabolism, seem major importance regulation oxidative capacity lipogenesis liver HFD HFD combined exercise training.
