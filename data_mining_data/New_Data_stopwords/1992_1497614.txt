 2-Oxoglutarate found inhibit purified rat liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase assay performed direction either phosphoenolpyruvate oxaloacetate synthesis. inhibition competitive respect oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate, Ki values 0.32 +/- 0.04 mM 0.63 +/- 0.19 mM respectively. 2-Oxoglutarate inhibited non-competitively tested GTP Mn2+. reported cytosolic concentrations 2-oxoglutarate rat hepatocytes enzyme likely significantly inhibited basal conditions. cytosolic concentration 2-oxoglutarate known fall precipitously influence glucagon hormones stimulate gluconeogenesis, suggested hormone-induced decrease 2-oxoglutarate content would alleviate inhibition phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase stimulate flux oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate. implications finding rationalization role pyruvate kinase stimulation gluconeogenesis fasted state discussed.
