 review metabolic pathways presented, involved muscular energy production hypoxia according recent experimental findings. means exercise examinations course reactions providing ATP anaerobically muscles limbs poor circulation analysed. Therefore, arteriovenous differences concentrations lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, hypoxanthine alanine femoral blood patients stage II AOD determined. addition, intracellular phosphorus compounds ATP, PCr Pi well tissue pH measured noninvasively calf muscles using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. results give evidence marked activation creatine kinase reaction, glycolysis, myokinase reaction purine nucleotide cycle ischaemic musculature loads short duration, total sufficient maintain concentration ATP even claudication pain. spite salvage pathways like alanine formation, end products "emergency reactions", Pi, H+ NH4+, accumulate exert deleterious cytotoxic effects, thought responsible rapid muscle fatigue claudication pain PAOD.
