 D-Nucleoside analogs, natural configuration, well L-nucleoside analogs, clinically relevant antiviral anticancer agents. Metabolism L-nucleoside analog diphosphates triphosphates, however, remains unexplored. Studies recombinant nm23-H1 -H2 isoforms indicated L-nucleoside analog diphosphates phosphorylated nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity. Therefore, roles creatine kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase evaluated using preparations commercial sources human HepG2 cells. Phosphorylation L-OddC, L-SddC, L-Fd4C, L-FMAU, L-ddC compared D-deoxynucleoside analogs, AraC, dFdC, D-FMAU, D-dideoxynucleoside analogs, ddC d4T. Results based preparations HepG2 cells showed L-nucleoside analog diphosphates selectively phosphorylated 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, whereas, D-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates phosphorylated NDPK. Interestingly, ddCDP d4TDP substrates creatine kinase, phosphorylated NDPK. conclusion, proposed specificity phosphorylating enzymes toward nucleoside analog diphosphates dependent configuration analog (L D) presence absence 3'-hydroxyl group sugar moiety. enzymatic process phosphorylation L- D-nucleoside analog diphosphates different cells.
