 order investigate insulin insensitivity pregnancy, activities key enzymes glycolysis lipid metabolism measured adipose muscle tissue biopsies 20 normal pregnant women undergoing caesarean section term, 23 non-pregnant women similar age body weight undergoing gynaecological surgery. activity pyruvate kinase decreased pregnant women adipose tissue (0.015 (0.009-0.024) (median range) vs 0.020 (0.009-0.038) Ug-1 wet weight, p less 0.05) muscle tissue (6.7 (3.6-10.9) vs 12.0 (2.8-16.2) U g-1 wet weight, p less 0.001). activity hexokinase decreased adipose tissue (0.045 (0.022-0.085) vs 0.057 (0.025-0.097) U g-1 wet weight, p less 0.05), activity phosphofructokinase decreased muscle tissue (1.3 (0.7-2.6) vs 2.1 (0.3-4.5) U g-1 wet weight, p less 0.01). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity increased muscle tissue (0.30 (0.11-0.59) vs 0.17 (0.09-0.48) U g-1 wet weight, p less 0.05), activity hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase decreased adipose tissue (0.5 (0.3-1.1) vs 1.0 (0.5-2.3) U g-1 wet weight p less 0.001) pregnant women. Similar results found enzyme activities calculated per gram protein, poorer reproducibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
