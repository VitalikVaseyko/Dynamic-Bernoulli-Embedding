 Targeting cancer metabolism potential lead major advances tumor therapy. Numerous promising metabolic drug targets identified. Yet, emerged singular metabolism defines oncogenic state cell. Rather, metabolism cancer cells function requirements tumor. Hence, tissue origin, (epi)genetic drivers, aberrant signaling, microenvironment together define metabolic requirements. chapter discuss light (epi)genetic, signaling, environmental factors diversity cancer metabolism based triple-negative estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, early- late-stage prostate cancer, liver cancer. types cancer display distinct partially opposing metabolic behaviors (e.g., Warburg versus reverse Warburg metabolism). Yet, cancers, distinct metabolism supports oncogenic phenotype. Finally, assess therapeutic potential metabolism based concepts metabolic normalization metabolic depletion.
