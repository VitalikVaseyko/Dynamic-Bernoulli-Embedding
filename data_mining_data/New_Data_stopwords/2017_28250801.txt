 BACKGROUND: shift respiration fermentation common metabolic hallmark cancer cells. result, glucose glutamine become prime fuels driving dysregulated growth tumors. simultaneous occurrence "Press-Pulse" disturbances considered mechanism responsible reduction organic populations prior evolutionary epochs. Press disturbances produce chronic stress, pulse disturbances produce acute stress populations. disturbances coincide population reduction occurred. METHODS: general concept applied management cancer creating chronic metabolic stresses tumor cell energy metabolism (press disturbance) coupled series acute metabolic stressors restrict glucose glutamine availability also stimulating cancer-specific oxidative stress (pulse disturbances). elevation non-fermentable ketone bodies protect normal cells energy stress enhancing energy stress tumor cells lack metabolic flexibility use ketones efficient energy source. Mitochondrial abnormalities genetic mutations make tumor cells vulnerable metabolic stress. RESULTS: press-pulse therapeutic strategy cancer management illustrated calorie restricted ketogenic diets (KD-R) used together drugs procedures create chronic intermittent acute stress tumor cell energy metabolism, protecting enhancing energy metabolism normal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Optimization dosing, timing, scheduling press-pulse therapeutic strategy facilitate eradication tumor cells minimal patient toxicity. therapeutic strategy used framework design clinical trials non-toxic management cancers.
