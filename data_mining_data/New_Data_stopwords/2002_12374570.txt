 isolated rat adipocytes, insulin stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase partially inhibited inhibitors PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase). combination, U0126 wortmannin completely block insulin stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase. concluded effect insulin pyruvate dehydrogenase rat adipocytes involves two distinct signalling pathways: one sensitive wortmannin U0126. synthetic phosphoinositolglycan PIG41 activate pyruvate dehydrogenase activation approx. 30% maximal effect insulin. modest activation completely blocked wortmannin alone, suggesting PIG41 acts one pathways leading activation pyruvate dehydrogenase.
