 1. Haematology, red cell metabolism blood chemistry five fledgeling black-faced cormorants Leucocarbo fuscescens studied results compared previously reported data several sea-birds. 2. mean erythrocyte count cormorant similar penguins lower flying, non-diving sea-birds. cormorant's red cell mean cell volume (MCV) lower penguins higher non-diving sea-birds. 3. Leucocyte numbers within expected limits avian species. 4. Red cell enzymes: glucose phosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase enolase higher cormorant little penguin; glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, monophosphoglyceromutase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase glutathione reductase lower. 5. Haemoglobin electrophoresis showed typical avian haemoglobin pattern.
