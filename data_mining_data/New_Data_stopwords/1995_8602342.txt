 rate acid production end-products sorbitol measured anaerobic conditions washed-cell suspensions oral strains Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus. enzymatic activities assayed cell extracts strains. cells fermented sorbitol lactate, formate, ethanol acetate anaerobic conditions. Exposure cells air (oxygen) led inactivation pyruvate formate-lyase inhibition anaerobic sorbitol fermentation. presence acetate, air-exposed cells fermented sorbitol concomitant consumption acetate production ethanol lactate. Acetate also enhanced acid production sorbitol cells kept anaerobic conditions resulted formation lactate ethanol. Cell extracts strains NADH-coupled acetate-reducing activity, consisted sequential reactions acetate kinase, phosphotransacetylase, acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase. findings indicate oral lactobacilli utilize acetate electron acceptor maintaining intracellular redox balance anaerobic sorbitol fermentation absence pyruvate formate-lyase activity.
