 liver cells fed rats, lactate utilization depends extracellular concentration threshold concentration lactate uptake equilibrates release 3 mM. Even-chain fatty acids (butyrate, octanoate, oleate) played crucial role (i) depress lactate release, 40% (butyrate oleate) 72% (octanoate), (ii) lower threshold concentration lactate utilization (down 1 mM octanoate). effects fatty acids connected inhibition hepatic glycolysis, estimated detritiation [6-3H]glucose (about -30% butyrate oleate -45% octanoate). Fatty acids depressed cellular concentration pyruvate which, physiological concentration lactate, favors utilization. rise ketone bodies concentration response fatty acids reflected enhanced acetyl CoA production, resulting accumulation citrate. parallel drop cellular concentration fructose 2,6-biphosphate. result, inhibition flux 6-phosphofructo-1 kinase (50, 75, 40% inhibition butyrate, octanoate, oleate, respectively). regulatory glycolysis steps, catalyzed glucokinase pyruvate kinase, affected fatty acids. Inhibition hepatic glycolysis fatty acids seems connected acetyl-CoA generation since octanoate, readily metabolized acetyl-CoA ketone bodies hepatocytes, potent stimulatory effect hepatic uptake lactate butyrate oleate. Propionate, yields practically acetyl CoA, slightly stimulated lactate release elevated threshold lactate utilization. present data suggest thus that, hepatocytes fed rats, fatty acids effectively inhibit glycolysis switch liver cell metabolism toward gluconeogenic conditions, promotes lactate utilization.
