 activity stability several enzymes facultative thermophile Bacillus flavothermus, grown within mesophilic thermophilic region 34 degrees C, 43 degrees C, 52 degrees C 70 degrees C, examined. temperature optima maxima enzymes tested found remain unchanged growth temperatures, demonstrated heat stability proteins increased ten perature, however, uniformly enzymes. One exception acetate kinase intrinsic stability pyruvate kinase found increase slightly. proteins tested (alanine dehydrogenase, isocitric dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxalacetate glutamate-pyruvate transaminase myokinase) intrinsic stability found increase 55 degrees C, stayed unaltered higher growth temperatures. Except acetate kinase myokinase, enzymes could stabilized respective substrates heat stability ES-complexes found also depend growth temperature cells. data lead conclusion enzymes undergo transition heat-labile thermostable within growth temperature range 44 degrees C 51 degrees C thermal characteristics changed beyond crucial region.
