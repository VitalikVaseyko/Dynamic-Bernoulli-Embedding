 increase red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration mouse postnatal development highly correlated decrease red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Immunoneutralization curves newborn adult red cell PK parallel, suggests higher PK activity newborn mouse red cells due primarily greater quantity PK protein. Mouse newborn adult red cell PK also differ mobility cellulose acetate electrophoresis (pH 7.5). true two strains mice (C57BL/6 IS/Cam) whose adult red cell PK electrophoretic patterns differ (single vs. double bands, respectively). Trypsinization alter electrophoretic mobilities C57BL/6 newborn adult red cell PK, convert IS/Cam adult PK single band greater mobility single band C57BL/6 adult PK. data consistent hypothesis mice structurally different forms PK newborn adult red cells, analogous fetal gamma- adult beta-globins humans.
