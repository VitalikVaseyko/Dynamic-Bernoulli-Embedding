 Ruminant liver quantitatively unique array substrates presented extensive fermentation dietary carbohydrate organic acids gastrointestinal tract. single largest input dietary energy extrasplanchnic tissues acetic acid derived fermentation, largely unused hepatic parenchyma. volatile fatty acids derived fermentation, primarily propionate, cleared extensively, completely, liver. results marked concentration gradient acids across liver lobule. L-lactate, derived tissue metabolism, well variable amounts rumen fermentation, used liver rate lower propionate predicted capacity based vitro enzymatic intact cell capacity data. net result selective utilization liver results peripheral blood containing significant concentrations L-lactate acetate, little organic acids. Propionate carbon metabolized liver cells converted glucose little true loss carbon, true lactate carbon. energetic efficiencies propionate lactate carbon converted glucose may much less optimal extensive cycling pyruvate kinase, pyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Inhibition futile cycling may represent one avenue energetic costs maintenance production lowered ruminants.
