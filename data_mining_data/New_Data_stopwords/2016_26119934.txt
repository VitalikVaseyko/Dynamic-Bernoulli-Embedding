 Cancer cells often gains growth advantage taking glucose high rate undergoing aerobic glycolysis intrinsic cellular factors reprogram glucose metabolism. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), key transmitter growth factor anchorage stimulation, aberrantly overexpressed activated solid tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). determined whether FAK act intrinsic driver promote aerobic glycolysis tumorigenesis. FAK inhibition decreases overexpression increases intracellular glucose levels unfavorable conditions, including growth factor deficiency cell detachment. Amplex glucose assay, fluorescence carbon-13 tracing studies demonstrate FAK promotes glucose consumption glucose-to-lactate conversion. Extracellular flux analysis indicates FAK enhances glycolysis decreases mitochondrial respiration. FAK increases key glycolytic proteins, including enolase, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase monocarboxylate transporter. Furthermore, active/tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK directly binds PKM2 promotes PKM2-mediated glycolysis. hand, FAK-decreased levels mitochondrial complex result reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Attenuation FAK-enhanced glycolysis re-sensitizes cancer cells growth factor withdrawal, decreases cell viability reduces growth tumor xenografts. observations, first time, establish vital role FAK cancer glucose metabolism alterations OXPHOS-to-glycolysis balance. Broadly targeting common phenotype aerobic glycolysis specifically FAK-reprogrammed glucose metabolism disrupt bioenergetic biosynthetic supply uncontrolled growth tumors, particularly glycolytic PDAC.
