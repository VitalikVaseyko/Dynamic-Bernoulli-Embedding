 activities delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase ALA dehydratase cord blood erythrocytes newborn infants peripheral blood red cells patients beta-thalassemia major, beta-thalassemia intermedia, hemoglobin Koln (Hb Koln) disease, sickle cell anemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency studied. activity ALA dehydratase vary appreciably number immature RBC (reticulocytes nucleated red blood cells) severity hemolytic anemia except pyruvate kinase deficiency. activity ALA synthetase linearly correlated number immature RBC (r=0.974, p less 0.001). ALA synthetase activity significantly decreased RBC Hb Koln (p less 0.01) compared activity immature RBC newborns patients pyruvate kinase deficiency, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia intermedia.
