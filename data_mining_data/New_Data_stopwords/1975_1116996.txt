 Factors influence distribution pyruvate dehydrogenase active, unphosphorylated form (PDHa) inactive, phosphorylated form (PDHb) examined isolated rat liver mitochondria. rapid freezing method developed extraction pyruvate dehydrogenase incubated mitochondria prevented interconversions PHDa PDHb normally occur mitochondria collected centrifugal methods. intramitochondrial ATP:ADP ration varied 100-fold range addition dinitrophenol, oligomycin, substances mitochondria oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate. PDHa activity found inversely proportional intramitochondrial ATP:ADP ratio closely correlated extramitochondrial adenine nucleotide levels. mitochondria incubated State 4 succinate rotenone, addition pyruvate increased PDHa activity 10-fold without appreciably altering mitochondrial ATP:ADP ratio. observations readily explained known inhibitory effects pyruvate ADP PDHa kinase. PDHa activity could maintained high level incubating mitochondria condition resembling State 3 addition succinate, glucose, hexokinase. addition octanoate reduced PDHa activity 60% without appreciably altering ATP:ADP ratio. Rotenone sililar effect. added presence octanoate, rotenone decreased PDHa activity whereas 4-pentenoate led increase activity. effects octanoate PDHa activity seen mitochondria incubated presence high levels pyruvate, though pyruvate oxidation till diminished 50%. data suggest octanoate addition favors PDHa kinase reaction leading inactivation PDHa, addition causes accumulation NADH acetyl-CoA recognized competitive inhibitors pyruvate dehydrogenase.
