 isoenzyme composition lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) alanine-aminotransferase determined livers CF-1 mice exposed 0, 5 10 ppm dieldrin diet, period 14 months. study carried evaluate whether liver tumor promoter dieldrin advances biological age CF-1 mouse liver. Oral dieldrin exposure induced dose-dependent shift towards fetal types lactic dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, within 1.5 months initiation treatment. initial shift, additional dieldrin-dependent changes found CF-1 mouse liver throughout experimental observation period. Thus, initial shifts isoenzyme composition LDH PK appear reflect adaptation liver increased functional demands imposed dieldrin treatment. expression cytoplasmic A-alanine-aminotransferase isoenzyme decreased age untreated control mice. Dieldrin treatment enhanced process dose-dependent manner. data suggest dieldrin treatment accelerate age-dependent changes gene expression.
