 role plasma membrane transporters cancer receiving increasing attention recent years. Several transporters essential nutrients up-regulated cancer serve tumour promoters. Transporters could also function tumour suppressors. date, four transporters belonging SLC gene family identified tumour suppressors. SLC5A8 Na(+)-coupled transporter monocarboxylates. Among substrates bacterial fermentation products butyrate propionate ubiquitous metabolite pyruvate. tumour-suppressive function transporter relates ability butyrate, propionate pyruvate inhibit histone deacetylases (HDAC). SLC5A8 functions tumour suppressor tissues studied thus far, provides molecular link Warburg effect, characteristic feature cancers. also links colonic bacteria dietary fibre host. SLC26A3 tumour suppressor restricted colon; Cl(-)/HCO(-) 3 exchanger, facilitating efflux HCO(-) 3 likely mechanism tumour-suppressive function SLC26A3 related intracellular pH regulation. SLC39A1 Zn(2+) transporter role tumour suppression shown prostate. Zn(2+) present high concentrations normal prostate elicits tumour-suppressive function. SLC22A18 possibly organic cation transporter, identity physiological substrates unknown. such, information molecular pathways responsible tumour-suppressive function transporter. likely additional SLC transporters discovered tumour suppressors future.
