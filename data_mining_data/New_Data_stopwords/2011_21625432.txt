 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) inhibition nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) related shift towards increased glycolysis cardiac pathological processes cardiac hypertrophy heart failure. transcription factors estrogen-related receptor-alpha (ERRalpha) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) regulate PDK4 expression potent transcriptional coactivator PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). NF-kappaB activation AC16 cardiac cells inhibit ERRalpha PPARbeta/delta transcriptional activity, resulting reduced PGC-1alpha PDK4 expression, enhanced glucose oxidation rate. However, addition NF-kappaB inhibitor parthenolide cells prevents downregulation PDK4 expression ERRalpha PPARbeta/delta DNA binding activity, thus suggesting additional transcription factors regulating PDK4. Interestingly, recent study demonstrated transcription factor E2F1, crucial cell cycle control, may regulate PDK4 expression. Given NF-kappaB may antagonize transcriptional activity E2F1 cardiac myocytes, sought study whether inflammatory processes driven NF-kappaB downregulate PDK4 expression human cardiac AC16 cells E2F1 inhibition. Protein coimmunoprecipitation indicated PDK4 downregulation entailed enhanced physical interaction p65 subunit NF-kappaB E2F1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated p65 translocation nucleus prevented recruitment E2F1 PDK4 promoter subsequent E2F1-dependent gene transcription. Interestingly, NF-kappaB inhibitor parthenolide prevented inhibition E2F1, E2F1 overexpression reduced interleukin expression stimulated cardiac cells. Based findings, propose NF-kappaB acts molecular switch regulates E2F1-dependent PDK4 gene transcription.
