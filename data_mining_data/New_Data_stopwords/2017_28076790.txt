 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) among aggressive human cancers. Although differentiation therapy proposed potential approach treat GBM, mechanisms induced differentiation remain poorly defined. Here, established induced differentiation model GBM using cAMP activators specifically directed GBM differentiation astroglia. Transcriptomic proteomic analyses revealed oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial biogenesis involved induced differentiation GBM. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) reverses Warburg effect, evidenced increased oxygen consumption reduced lactate production. Mitochondrial biogenesis induced activation CREB-PGC1alpha pathway triggers metabolic shift differentiation. Blocking mitochondrial biogenesis using mdivi1 silencing PGC1alpha abrogates differentiation; conversely, overexpression PGC1alpha elicits differentiation. GBM xenograft models patient-derived GBM samples, cAMP activators also induce tumor growth inhibition differentiation. data show mitochondrial biogenesis metabolic switch oxidative phosphorylation drive differentiation tumor cells.
