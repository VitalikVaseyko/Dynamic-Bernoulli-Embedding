 Mitochondrial dysfunctions detected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, less information exists regarding adaptation mitochondrial function initiation hepatic steatosis. study aimed determine rat liver sequence mitochondrial metabolic adaptations occurring first 8 weeks moderate high fat diet (HFD). Sprague-Dawley rats fed HFD 2, 4, 8 weeks. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption, respiratory chain complexes activity, oxidative phosphorylation efficiency assessed isolated liver mitochondria. Gene expression related fat metabolism mitochondrial biogenesis determined. Results compared data collected group rats sacrificed starting HFD feeding. 2 4 weeks HFD, development fatty liver concomitant increase expression mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (mtGPAT) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Higher serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels enhanced hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression suggested increased fatty acid oxidation. However, mitochondrial respiration respiratory chain activity normal. 8 weeks HFD, lower accumulation liver triglycerides associated reduced expression mtGPAT. time, oxygen consumption palmitoyl-L: -carnitine decreased whereas oxidative phosphorylation efficiency (ATP/O) succinate enhanced. Hepatic levels mtDNA unchanged whatever time points. longitudinal study rats fed HFD showed hepatic lipid homeostasis mitochondrial function adapt face increase fatty acid availability.
