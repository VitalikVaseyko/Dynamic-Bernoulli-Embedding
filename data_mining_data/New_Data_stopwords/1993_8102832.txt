 review, evaluate relative regulatory importance specific strategic enzymes (in particular glycogen synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACC] pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [PDH]) carbohydrate utilization anabolic precursor energy substrate nutritional transitions fed fasted states. involvement specific protein kinases contributing inactivation enzymes phosphorylation [cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase PDH kinase] achieving regulatory response also assessed. demonstrate striking temporal correlation hepatic glycogen mobilization PDH ACC inactivation phosphorylation immediate postabsorptive period; contrast, rates hepatic glycogen synthesis PDH ACC expressed activities change parallel refeeding. results consistent shifting primary sites control overall hepatic carbon flux fed-to-starved starved-to-fed nutritional transitions achieved, least part, complex pattern regulation protein phosphorylation metabolites critically dependent precise nutritional status. Data also presented demonstrate asynchronous suppression glucose uptake/phosphorylation pyruvate oxidation cardiac skeletal muscle progressive starvation. Analogous asynchrony observed reactivation processes cardiac skeletal muscle refeeding starvation. provide evidence support concept selective suppression pyruvate oxidation oxidative muscles early starvation initial phase refeeding achieved differential sensitivity glucose uptake/phosphorylation pyruvate oxidation lipid-fuel utilization. discuss relative importance regulatory events governing local fatty acid production utilization (via lipoprotein lipase carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, respectively) overall fatty acid supply (dictated events adipocyte) fuel utilization muscle nutritional transitions. Finally, assess regulatory importance glycogen synthesis determining overall rates glucose clearance skeletal muscle alimentary hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia.
