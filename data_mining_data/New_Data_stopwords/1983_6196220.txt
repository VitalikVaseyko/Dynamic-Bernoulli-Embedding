 specific activities pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase lactate dehydrogenase increase P-815 mastocytoma cells approach stationary phase. growth period, rates uptake labelled precursors DNA, RNA total protein decreases. hand, pyruvate kinase protein level changes parallel activity. Although K-isozyme primary form pyruvate kinase expressed, M-type subunit also present forms undergo increase specific activity. addition, pyruvate kinase expression also elevated adding cAMP analogues theophylline, butyrate conditioned media. increased level expression hypothesized secondary event associated differentiation-like-induced expression mast cell phenotype.
