 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency initially described Valentine et al. 1961. Since then, 300 cases described, including 65 Japan. PK deficiency common hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia among several red cell enzyme defects Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway. clinical manifestations highly variable. Splenectomy usually increases hemoglobin level 2 g/100 mL. Standardization methods characterization PK variants achieved 1979. four PK isozymes, M1, M2, L R, mammalian tissues. clarified switch M2-type L-type PK maturation erythroid precursor cells. Recently cloned sequenced full length human L-type PK cDNA. useful clarify molecular basis PK deficiency.
