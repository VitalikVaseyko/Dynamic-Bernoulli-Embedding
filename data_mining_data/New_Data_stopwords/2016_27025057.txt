 novel ideas fundamental role mitochondria maintenance viability malignant cells reviewed. modern state research considered detail, including: mitochondrial control cellular redox state, sites reactive oxygen species (ROS) production inner mitochondrial membrane antioxidant protection systems. Specificities structural-functional mitochondrial remodelling malignant tumors, mechanisms energy metabolism reprogramming, enhancement ROS production adaptation hypoxic conditions metabolic stress analyzed. available data including research transplanted tumors indicate cytotoxic action sodium dichloroacetate (the inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) depends biological properties tumors intensity structural-functional mitochondrial rearrangement. Dichloroacetate turned effective sarcoma 37, Lewis lung carcinoma.
