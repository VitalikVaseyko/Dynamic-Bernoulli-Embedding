 BACKGROUND: determination Tumor M2 Pyruvate Kinase (Tumor M2-PK) EDTA plasma described tumor marker variety different tumor types. Since GI tumors grow intraluminally, appeared interesting determine whether Tumor M2-PK detectable feces tumor patients. MATERIALS METHODS: Measurements performed commercially available ELISA (ScheBo Biotech AG, Giessen, Germany) modified fecal analysis. Samples controls, GI cancer adenoma patients tested. RESULTS: Fecal Tumor M2-PK concentrations could quantified. significant difference cancer patients controls found. highest concentrations observed colorectal cancer. However, fecal Tumor M2-PK detectable 5 tumor patients. CONCLUSION: measurement fecal Tumor M2-PK concentrations might provide interesting screening tool colorectal cancer. studies comparing determination Tumor M2-PK stool occult blood stool progress.
