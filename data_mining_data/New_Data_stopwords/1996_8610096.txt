 crystal structure pyruvate phosphate dikinase, histidyl multiphosphotransfer enzyme synthesizes adenosine triphosphate, reveals three-domain molecule phosphohistidine domain flanked nucleotide phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate domains, two substrate binding sites approximately 45 angstroms apart. modes substrate binding deduced analogy D-Ala-D-Ala ligase pyruvate kinase. Coupling two remote active sites facilitated two conformational states phosphohistidine domain. crystal structure represents state interaction nucleotide, second state achieved swiveling around two flexible peptide linkers. dramatic conformational transition brings phosphocarrier residue close proximity phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate. swiveling-domain paradigm provides effective mechanism communication complex multidomain/multiactive site proteins.
