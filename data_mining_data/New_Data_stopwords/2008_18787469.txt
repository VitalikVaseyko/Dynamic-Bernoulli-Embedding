 BACKGROUND: currently available tumour markers used management patients colorectal metastases limited value. Tumour M2-pyruvate kinase (TuM2-PK), tumour-associated isoenzyme pyruvate kinase, elevated patients gastrointestinal cancer. study measured TuM2-PK levels patients resection colorectal liver metastases (CLM). MATERIALS METHODS: Fifty patients CLM local residual disease TuM2-PK levels measured liver resection. 20 patients, TuM2-PK levels repeated 2 weeks, 5 weeks 5 months resection. Plasma levels analysed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ScheBo, Giessen, Germany). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) CA19-9 levels measured time periods electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. CEA, CA19-9 TuM2-PK levels compared tumour number, volume, differentiation stage. Cut-off values used TuM2-PK, CEA CA19-9 15 IU/ml, 10 ng/ml 39 IU/ml, respectively. RESULTS: TuM2-PK elevated 68%, CEA 62% CA19-9 40% patients CLM. TuM2-PK+CEA elevated 88% TuM2-PK+CA19-9 78% patients. significant correlation observed tumour volume CEA (r=0.34, P<0.05) CA19-9 (r=0.49, P<0.005). TuM2-PK levels show significant correlation tumour differentiation, volume number metastases. 2 weeks liver resection, CEA CA19-9 levels decreased normal value 73 67% patients, respectively, TuM2-PK remained elevated patients. 5 weeks, TuM2-PK, CEA CA19-9 levels decreased normal 64, 93 70% patients, respectively, 5 months levels normal 58, 92 67%. CONCLUSION: Plasma TuM2-PK commonly elevated patients CLM. Levels correlate tumour volume, number differentiation. Levels remain elevated liver resection, cause requires investigation.
