 tumour cells, tetramer/dimer ratio pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK) determines whether glucose carbons degraded lactate production energy (tetrameric form) channelled synthetic processes (dimeric form). influence different tumour microenvironment conditions tetramer/dimer ratio M2-PK cell doublings investigated non-metastatic metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line. metastatic Colo357 cells contained fourfold M2-PK protein 3.5-fold dimeric M2-PK non-metastatic Panc-1 cells. Colo357 cells hypoxia, glucose starvation well acidification induced increase dimeric form M2-PK, whereas Panc-1 cells effect M2-PK observed. hypoxia Colo357 cells, dimerization inactivation M2-PK results inhibition cell proliferation, whereas glucose starvation acidification dimerization M2-PK allowed cell doublings. M2-PK expression quaternary structure M2-PK influenced tumour metastatic potential. quaternary structure M2-PK may differently affected hypoxia, glucose starvation acidification severe consequences cell doublings.
