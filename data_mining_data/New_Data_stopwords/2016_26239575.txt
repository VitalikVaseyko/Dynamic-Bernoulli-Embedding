 aim study investigate activities important enzymes involved energetic metabolism liver rats experimentally infected Trypanosoma evansi. Adenylate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) liver homogenate, well aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), clotting time plasma evaluated 5 15 days post-infection (PI). activities respiratory chain complexes Na(+), K(+)-ATPase also evaluated. study demonstrates energetic metabolism impairment rats infected T. evansi. reduced energy metabolism liver rats infected T. evansi observed, demonstrated AK decreased PK increased activities 5 days PI, mechanism known energetic compensation. However, 15 days PI decrease AK PK activities observed. addition, increase activities respiratory chain complexes II, II-III IV infected rats 15 days PI, decrease Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities infected rats days 5 15 PI verified. plasma, observed increase ALT AST activities days 5 15 PI, increase clotting time infected rats. changes caused T. evansi infection activity enzymes hepatic energy metabolism corroborate elucidate mechanisms lead liver injury inflammatory infiltration verified T. evansi infected rats. Therefore, alterations directly related disease pathogenesis.
