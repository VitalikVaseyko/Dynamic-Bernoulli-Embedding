 Ischemia responsible many metabolic abnormalities heart, causing changes organ function. One modifications occurring ischemic cell changing aerobic anaerobic metabolism. change causes predominance use carbohydrates energy substrate instead lipids. case, glycogen essential maintenance heart energy intake, important reserve resist stress caused hypoxia, using glycolysis lactic acid fermentation. order study glucose anaerobic pathways utilization understand metabolic adaptations, New Zealand white rabbits subjected ischemia caused Inflow occlusion technique. animals monitored surgery pH lactate levels. Transcription analysis pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase enzymes performed qRT-PCR, glycogen quantification determined enzymatically. Pyruvate kinase transcription increased ischemia, followed glycogen consumption content. gluconeogenesis increased control ischemia moments, suggesting relationship gluconeogenesis glycogen metabolism. result shows significant contribution substrates organ energy supply demonstrates capacity heart adapt metabolism injury, sustaining homeostasis short-term myocardial ischemia.
