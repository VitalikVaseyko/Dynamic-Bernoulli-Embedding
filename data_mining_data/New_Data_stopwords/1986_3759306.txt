 three groups healthy young subjects (n = 33; mean ages 6.4, 13.5, 17.1 years), muscle enzyme activities (creatine kinase, hexose phosphate isomerase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, fumarase) vastus lateralis muscle investigated show age-dependent variations. significant age-dependent increase aldolase (P less 0.05) pyruvate kinase (P less 0.01) activity decrease fumarase activity (P less 0.01) computed. relation age-dependent variation, maximum LDH activities could measured age 12-14 years; significantly decreased activities glycolytic enzymes could found youngest group.
