 metabolic/cell signaling basis Warburg's effect ("aerobic glycolysis") general metabolic phenotype adopted cancer cells first reviewed. Several bypasses adopted provide panoramic integrated view tumoral metabolism, attributing central signaling role hypoxia-induced factor (HIF-1) expression aerobic glycolysis. cancer metabolic phenotype also results alterations routes involving ras, myc, p53, Akt signaling propensity cancer cells develop signaling aberrances (notably aberrant surface receptor expression) which, present, offer unique opportunities therapeutic interventions. rationale various emerging strategies cancer treatment presented along mechanisms PPAR ligands might interfere directly tumoral metabolism promote anticancer activity. Clinical trials using PPAR ligands reviewed followed concluding remarks perspectives future studies. therapeutic need associate PPAR ligands anticancer agents perhaps important lesson learned results clinical trials conducted date.
