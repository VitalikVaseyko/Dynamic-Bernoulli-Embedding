 Utilization transcription factors might powerful approach modification metabolism generation crops superior characteristics single transcription factor frequently regulates coordinated expression set key genes respective pathways. Here, apply plant-specific Dof1 transcription factor improve nitrogen assimilation, essential metabolism including primary assimilation ammonia carbon skeletons biosynthesize amino acids organic compounds involving nitrogen plants. Expressing Dof1 induced up-regulation genes encoding enzymes carbon skeleton production, marked increase amino acid contents, reduction glucose level transgenic Arabidopsis. results suggest cooperative modification carbon nitrogen metabolisms basis intimate link. Furthermore, elementary analysis revealed nitrogen content increased Dof1 transgenic plants (approximately 30%), indicating promotion net nitrogen assimilation. significantly, Dof1 transgenic plants exhibit improved growth low-nitrogen conditions, agronomically important trait. results highlight great utility transcription factors engineering metabolism plants.
