 Expression L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) upregulated liver dietary carbohydrate. Previously, 3 carbohydrate/insulin response elements identified 5'-flanking region L-PK gene bp -170. Studies 5'-flanking region beyond bp -183 transgenic mice suggested regulatory elements may present upstream bp -183, positions elements uncertain. present study, existence regulatory regions L-PK gene responding stimulation feeding examined using vivo hydrodynamics-based gene transfection (HT) mouse liver. firefly-luciferase (FL) gene, fused various lengths 5'-flanking region L-PK gene, introduced mouse liver HT. mice free access high-carbohydrate diet. liver homogenate, luciferase activity pL-PK(-1467)-FL (which included 5'-flanking region bp -1467 +17), markedly stimulated feeding. 5'-Deletion bp -1065 caused minor changes luciferase activity, deletion bp -690 bp -203 caused significant, gradual decreases activity. analyses utilizing 5'-deletion mutants indicated existence positive regulatory regions respond stimulation feeding bp -1065 -945, -300 -203 L-PK gene. results suggest unidentified cis-acting DNA elements exist upstream region L-PK gene, HT useful approach detecting regulatory regions genes expressed liver.
