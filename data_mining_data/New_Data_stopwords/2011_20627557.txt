 novel series benzoazepin-2-ones designed synthesized targeting PIF pocket AGC protein kinases, among series thioether-linked benzoazepin-2-ones discovered bind PIF pocket 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), displace PIF peptide EC(50) values lower micromolar range. structure-activity relationships (SARs) linker region, tail region, distal region explored optimize novel binders target PIF pocket PDK1. tested vitro PDK1 enzymatic assay using peptide substrate, benzodiazepin-2-ones increased activity enzyme concentration-dependent fashion, indicating compounds act PDK1 allosteric activators. new compounds may developed therapeutic agents treatment diseases PDK1-mediated AGC protein kinases dysregulated.
