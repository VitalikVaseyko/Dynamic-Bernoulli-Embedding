 Recently, glucagon second messenger, cyclic AMP, shown stimulate transcription rate several upper eukaryotic genes (1-5). show glucagon also block gene transcription. glucagon cyclic AMP found inhibit transcription genes encoding three liver glycolytic enzymes, including L-type pyruvate kinase aldolase B. Thus, cyclic AMP proves activator also inhibitor gene transcription eukaryotes.
