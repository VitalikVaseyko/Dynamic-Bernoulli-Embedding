 gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)-positive foci glutathione-S-transferase, placental (GST-P)-positive lesions occupied 36% 54% liver parenchyma, respectively, Wistar rats 8 weeks initiation diethylnitrosamine, followed selection. administration S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM, 384 mumol/kg/day) caused 77% 42% falls percentage GGT-positive GST-P-positive lesions, respectively. also occurred 46% decrease labeling index GGT-positive foci, SAM-treated rats. changes associated decrease liver pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. SAM affect enzymatic activities normal uninitiated controls, caused consistent increase initiated rats. Enolase, fructose-biphosphatase malic enzyme (ME) activities increased liver initiated rats. SAM modify significantly enzymatic activities, either control initiated rats. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 113% higher liver initiated rats uninitiated controls. SAM treatment significantly affect enzymatic activity uninitiated rats, caused great decrease initiated ones. expected, occurred marked rise GGT activity liver initiated rats, respect controls. SAM caused increase GGT activity normal uninitiated controls, caused 77% fall GGT activity initiated rats, coupled 380% rise remodeling GGT-positive lesions. Histochemical determination G6PDH activities showed absence SAM many preneoplastic lesions expressed higher G6PDH activities surrounding liver. SAM affect ME-positive lesions, caused decrease number G6PDH-positive lesions. Immunohistochemical determination PK activity, isoenzyme L, showed decrease GST-P-positive lesions. Many lesions longer recognizable lesions expressing low PK activity, SAM-treated rats. However, relatively small number GST-P-positive lesions expressing low PK activity still present rats. data suggest glucose channelled triacylglycerol pyruvate synthesis decreases rat liver, development preneoplastic foci, production reducing equivalents pentose phosphates increases, thus favoring DNA synthesis detoxification reactions. Decrease DNA synthesis, SAM-treated rats, paralleled partial reversion carbohydrate metabolic features present normal liver.
