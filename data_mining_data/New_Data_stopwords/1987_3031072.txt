 Maximal doses glucagon increase phosphorylation state 12 cytosolic proteins isolated hepatocytes fasted rats (Garrison, J. C., Wagner, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13135-13143). Incubation hepatocytes lower concentrations glucagon indicates hierarchy substrates exists concentration glucagon required half-maximal increases phosphorylation varying 5-15-fold. proteins whose phosphorylation state sensitive low concentrations glucagon pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, play key roles regulation gluconeogenesis. Treatment hepatocytes (Sp)-cAMPS, stimulatory diastereomer adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate, mimics response seen glucagon. hepatocytes pretreated cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMPS, phosphorylation response abolished low concentrations glucagon, dose glucagon required half-maximal stimulation phosphorylation increased 5-10-fold. (Sp)-cAMPS-stimulated increases phosphorylation state also blunted (Rp)-cAMPS. results provide direct pharmacological evidence activation cAMP-dependent protein kinase response glucagon intact cell. Although low doses glucagon appear stimulate protein phosphorylation via cAMP-dependent protein kinase, high doses glucagon also cause small increase concentration free intracellular Ca2+ hepatocytes. glucagon-stimulated increases level Ca2+ mimicked (Sp)-cAMPS inhibited pretreatment (Rp)-cAMPS. results suggest glucagon elevate intracellular Ca2+ via cAMP cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
