 Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) soluble pentameric protein expressed cartilage involved collagen organization. Tissue microarrays derived two cohorts patients breast cancer (n=122 n=498) immunostained, revealing varying expression COMP, tumor cells surrounding stroma. High levels COMP tumor cells correlated, independently variables, poor survival decreased recurrence-free survival. Breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231, stably expressing COMP injected mammary fat pad SCID (CB-17/Icr-Prkdc(scid)/Rj) mice. Tumors expressing COMP significantly larger prone metastasize compared control, mock-transfected, tumors. vitro experiments confirmed COMP-expressing cells invasive phenotype, could part attributed upregulation matrix metalloprotease-9. Furthermore, microarray analyses gene expression tumors formed vivo showed COMP expression induced higher expression genes protecting endoplasmic reticulum stress. observation confirmed vitro COMP-expressing cells showed better survival well higher rate protein synthesis treated brefeldin A, compared control cells. Further, COMP-expressing cells appeared undergo metabolic switch, is, Warburg effect. Thus, vitro measurement cell respiration indicated decreased mitochondrial metabolism. conclusion, COMP novel biomarker breast cancer, contributes severity disease metabolic switching increasing invasiveness tumor cell viability, leading reduced survival animal models human patients.
