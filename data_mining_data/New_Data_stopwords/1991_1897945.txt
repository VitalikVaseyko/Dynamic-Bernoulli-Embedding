 Interactions intramitochondrial ATP-generating, ADP-requiring processes ATP-requiring, ADP-generating phosphorylation glucose mitochondrially bound hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) investigated using well-coupled mitochondria isolated rat brain. ADP generated mitochondrially bound hexokinase effective stimulating respiration ADP generated hexokinase dissociated mitochondria, pyruvate kinase less effective scavenger ADP generated mitochondrially bound hexokinase case ADP generated dissociated enzyme. results indicate ADP generated mitochondrially bound enzyme least partially sequestered directed toward mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation apparatus. conditions experiments, maximum rate ATP production oxidative phosphorylation approximately 10-fold greater maximum rate ATP generation adenylate kinase reaction. Moreover, periods active oxidative phosphorylation, adenylate kinase made detectable contribution ATP production. Thus, adenylate kinase represent major source ATP hexokinase bound actively phosphorylating brain mitochondria. adenylate kinase sole source ATP, steady state attained ATP formation balanced utilization hexokinase reaction. contrast, oxidative phosphorylation source ATP, steady state rate Glc phosphorylation attained, equivalent 40-50% rate ATP production thus continued net increase ATP concentration system. Rates Glc phosphorylation ATP generated oxidative phosphorylation exceeded seen equivalent levels exogenously added ATP. Moreover, total ATP concentrations greater approximately 0.2 mM, hexokinase bound actively phosphorylating mitochondria unresponsive continued slow increases ATP levels; acute increase ATP (by addition exogenous nucleotide) did, however, result increased hexokinase activity. relative insensitivity mitochondrially bound hexokinase extramitochondrial ATP suggested dependence intramitochondrial pool (or pools) ATP active oxidative phosphorylation. Two intramitochondrial compartments ATP identified based selective release inhibitors electron transport oxidative phosphorylation. compartments distinguished sensitivity inhibitors kinetics filled ATP generated oxidative phosphorylation. Exogenous glycerol kinase competed effectively mitochondrially bound hexokinase extramitochondrial ATP, relatively low levels glycerol kinase completely inhibiting phosphorylation Glc.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
