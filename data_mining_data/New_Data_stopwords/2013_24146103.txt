 CD133 useful putative marker cancer stem cells (CSCs) human laryngeal tumors. Numerous studies demonstrated CD133+ CSCs possess higher clonogenicity, invasiveness tumorigenesis compared CD133- cells. Recently, interest Warburg effect microenvironment CSCs escalated. Warburg effect dictates cancer cells rely glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation aerobic conditions. numerous cancer cells, glucose used mainly glycolytic pathway. Stem cells express high levels glycolytic enzymes rely mostly glycolysis meet energy demands. Glucose transported cell membranes glucose transporters (Glut). Studies Glut-1 expression CSCs limited. present study, investigated proliferation CD133+ Hep-2 cells whether Glut-1 expressed laryngeal carcinoma CD133+ Hep-2 cells. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated size CD133 product 213 bp. Dissociation curve analysis demonstrated expected peaks 82.1 C CD133. mean DeltaCt CD133 expression 10.98. Prior isolation, CD133+ fraction 1.2% fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Following isolation, CD133+ fraction increased 76.1%. Successive tests also demonstrated cells grew well following isolation. proliferation CD133+ CD133- cells different first 3 days (P>0.05). day 4, proliferation capacity CD133+ cells vitro higher CD133- cells (P<0.05). mean DeltaCt Glut-1 mRNA expression 1.78 CD133+ cells 1.00 CD133- cells (P<0.05). mean Glut-1 protein values CD133+ CD133- Hep-2 cells relative beta-tubulin 0.48 +/- 0.02 0.21 +/- 0.03 (microg/microl), respectively (P<0.05). conclusion, CD133+ cells demonstrated higher proliferation. Glut-1 mRNA protein levels higher CD133+ CD133- cells. results suggest Glut-1 important energy supply laryngeal CD133+ Hep-2 cells Glut-1 may represent potential therapeutic target inhibition proliferation laryngeal CSCs.
