 Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-S (GAPDHS) phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2), two isozymes restricted male germline, catalyze successive steps glycolytic pathway mammalian sperm. Although gene targeting isozyme demonstrated glycolysis required normal sperm motility male fertility, phenotype mice lacking GAPDHS severe mice lacking PGK2. study examined sperm function, signaling pathways, metabolism investigate factors contribute phenotypic differences knockout models. Sperm two knockouts exhibited comparable deficits zona binding, vitro fertilization without zona drilling, capacitation-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. contrast, signaling metabolic differences apparent prior capacitation. Phosphorylation sperm protein phosphatase 1, associated acquisition motile capacity epididymal maturation, deficient GAPDHS-null sperm. Carnitine, choline, phosphocholine, taurine elevated sperm knockouts immediately collection epididymis. However, carnitine levels PGK2-null sperm significantly different wild-type sperm, four metabolites significantly higher GAPDHS-null sperm. confirmed glycolysis required robust hyperactivation, found motility PGK2-null sperm improved levels comparable wild-type sperm pyruvate sole metabolic substrate. nonglycolysable substrate improve progressive motility GAPDHS-null sperm. results identify multiple signaling metabolic defects likely contributors male infertility absence progressive sperm motility seen mice lacking GAPDHS.
