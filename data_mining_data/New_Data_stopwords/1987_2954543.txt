 characteristics site inhibition gluconeogenesis endotoxin investigated liver cells isolated control endotoxin-treated rats. Endotoxin treatment associated inhibition (40-50%) gluconeogenesis lactate plus pyruvate range concentrations substrate oleate without glucose glucagon. Similar inhibition observed asparagine, proline, glutamine, alanine substrate mixture, glycerol, glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone endogenous substrates. change cellular ATP content rates ketogenesis ureogenesis asparagine, proline glutamine. effects isotopic fluxes, metabolite contents, enzyme activities control coefficients consistent suggestion effects endotoxin gluconeogenesis exerted level phosphofructokinase-1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate carboxylase glucokinase.
