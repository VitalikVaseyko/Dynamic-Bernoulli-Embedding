 Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase plays role purine salvage catalyzing direct conversion adenine adenosine monophosphate. involvement purine salvage pathway tumor proliferation angiogenesis makes adenine phosphoribosyltransferase potential target oncology drug discovery. expressed characterized recombinant, N-terminally His-tagged human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Two assay formats assessed use high throughput screen: spectrophotometric-based enzyme-coupled assay system radiometric ionic capture scintillation proximity bead assay format. Ultimately, scintillation proximity assay format chosen automated screening compatibility limitations coupled assay. describe biochemical characterization adenine phosphoribosyltransferase development robust, homogeneous, 384-well assay suitable high throughput screening.
