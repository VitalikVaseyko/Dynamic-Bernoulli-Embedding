 1. Electron microscopic studies sieve tube sap obtained secondary phloem Robinia pseudoacacia method Hartig (1860) showed presence well developed mitochondria addition membrane fragments. 2. sieve tube sap following enzymes could detected qualitatively: UTP-glucose-1-phosphate-uridyl transferase, UDPG-fructose glucosyl transferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase (for glucose fructose), phosphohexose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, UDPG-pyrophosphatase. 3. following enzymes determined quantitatively: phosphorylase, amylase, aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, NAD(+)-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarase, malate dehydrogenase, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase, anorganic pyrophosphatase. 4. following enzymes could detected: UDGP dehydrogenase, UDPG-fructose-6-phosphate-glucosyltransferase, invertase, phosphoglucomutase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase. 5. enzyme pattern sieve tube saps Tilia platyphyllos, Carpinus betulus, Fraxinus americana, Quercus borealis maxima, Salix viminalis qualitatively similar Robinia, shows quantitative differences (as far analyzed). 6. meaning results metabolism function sieve tubes situ discussed.
