 iTRAQ analyses proved invaluable discovery potential cancer markers, two outstanding issues remained ineffectiveness consistently detect specific proteins interest complex sample determine absolute abundance proteins. addressed availability mTRAQ reagents (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) nonisobaric variant iTRAQ. applied newly emerging technique quantify one potential markers endometrial cancer, viz. pyruvate kinase M1/M2. mTRAQ methodolgy relies multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) target tryptic peptides protein interest, thus, ensuring maximal opportunity detection, nonisobaric tags enable specific quantification version labeled peptides unique MRM transitions conferred labels. Known amounts synthetic peptides tagged one two available mTRAQ labels, used quantification standards mixture oppositely labeled tryptically digested sample, permit determination absolute amounts corresponding protein sample. ability label sample reference peptides either one two possible combinations inherent advantage method, provides means verification reported ratios. study, determined amount pyruvate kinase present homogenate biopsied EmCa tissue sample 85 nmol/g total proteins, equivalent concentration nonmalignant controls 21-26 nmol/g total proteins. approximately 4-fold higher amount pyruvate kinase cancer sample confirmed direct comparison cancer sample one nonmalignant controls, also independently enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Additionally, 4-fold higher level pyruvate kinase amount cancer homogenate reported study considerably higher 2-fold higher ratio reported across 20 cancer samples discovery phase iTRAQ technique, suggesting exists possibility dynamic range ratios determined iTRAQ technique may compressed.
