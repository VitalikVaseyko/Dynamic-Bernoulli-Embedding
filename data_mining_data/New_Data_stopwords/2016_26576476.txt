 Hypoxia proved typical character solid tumors. Tumor cells prefer use glucose glycolysis pathway instead aerobic respiration. However, precise molecular mechanism underlying so-called Warburg effect remains elusive. current study, siRNA synthesized transfected BxPC-3 cell line silence expression HIF-1alpha gene. found hypoxia induced hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) overexpression BxPC-3 cells, enhanced expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 lactate dehydrogenase A, thus facilitating glycolysis making tumor cells tolerant hypoxic stress. silencing HIF-1alpha gene significantly attenuated glycolysis hypoxic conditions, inhibited growth invasion ability BxPC-3 cells, enhanced hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis.
