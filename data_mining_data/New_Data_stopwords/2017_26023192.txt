 OBJECTIVES: Increased erythrocytic osmotic fragility splenomegaly reported anemic Abyssinian Somali cats. report condition anemic domestic shorthair cats two breeds, describe common features clinicopathological profiles, management outcomes. METHODS: Anemic cats, Abyssinians Somalis, included. erythrocytic osmotic fragility test performed, known causes anemia excluded, illness followed medical records reviewed. RESULTS: Twelve neutered cats first found anemic 0.5 9.0 years age. Pallor, lethargy, inappetence, pica, weight loss splenomegaly commonly observed. moderate-to-severe macrocytic hypochromic anemia variable regeneration noted. Infectious disease screening, direct Coombs' pyruvate kinase DNA mutation test results negative. Freshly drawn blood appear hemolysed became progressively lysed storage 4 degrees C. sigmoid osmotic fragility curves moderately severely right shifted, indicating erythrocytic fragility 20 degrees C. Cross-correction studies indicated intrinsic red cell effect rather plasma effect. cats treated immunosuppressive doses prednisolone doxycycline, variable responses. Five cats recurrent persistent anemia responded well splenectomy. However, two occasional recurrence severe anemia: one found Bartonella vinsonii-positive one episode responded azithromycin prednisolone, cat two episodes severe anemia unknown cause. Finally, six cats euthanized within 1 month 7 years initial presentation. Histopathology six spleens revealed mainly congestion extramedullary hematopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS RELEVANCE: Similarly Abyssinian Somali cats, domestic shorthair cats breeds also develop severe erythrocytic osmotic fragility anemia splenomegaly, considered differential diagnosis anemic cats.
