 GLUT1 facilitative transporter playing major role internalization glucose. Basally, GLUT1 resides vesicles located para-golgian area, translocated onto plasmamembrane upon activation PI3KC1-AKT pathway. proliferating cancer cells, demand high quantity glucose metabolism, GLUT1 permanently expressed plasmamembrane. associated abnormal activation PI3KC1-AKT pathway, consequent mutational activation PI3KC1 and/or loss PTEN. latter, fact, could antagonize phosphorylation AKT limiting availability Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Here, asked whether PTEN could control plasmamembrane expression GLUT1 also protein-phosphatase activity AKT. Experiments co-immunoprecipitation vitro de-phosphorylation assay homogenates cells transgenically expressing wild type knocked-down mutants (lipid-phosphatase, protein-phosphatase, both) isoforms demonstrated indeed PTEN physically interacts AKT drives dephosphorylation, limiting expression GLUT1 plasmamembrane. also show growth factors limit ability PTEN dephosphorylate AKT. data emphasize fact PTEN acts two distinct steps PI3k/AKT pathway control expression GLUT1 plasmamembrane and, further, add AKT list protein substrates PTEN.
