 interaction series alkylamines muscle pyruvate kinase investigated kinetic physical studies order understand mechanisms certain monovalent cations activate enzyme define several important conformational changes necessary catalytic activity. Monomethylammonium ion interacts pyruvate kinase activate enzyme. Dimethyland trimethylammonium ions activate, competitive inhibitors activating cations. Tetramethylammonium ion neither activates inhibits pyruvate kinase activity. enzyme presence monomethylammonium ion dimethylammonium ion, conformational change observed ultraviolet difference spectroscopy. conformational change similar observed activating cations appears necessary sufficient conformational change formation active complex. interaction substrate phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase-Mn2+ complex presence cations studied water proton relaxation rate measurements. affinity enzyme-Mn2+ complex phosphoenolpyruvate decreased factor 5 presence alkylamines compared affinity measured presence K+ NH4+. change Km phosphoenolpyruvate observed however measured presence monomethylammonium ion, suggesting decrease affinity substrate reason lack enzymic activity. conformation ternary enzyme-Mn2+-phosphoenolpyruvate complex bound Mn2+, reflected enhancement values (epsilont) measured, differs depending upon nature monovalent cation. epsilon values measured presence alkylamines larger (epsilont - 5.7 +/- 0.2) measured presence K+ NH4+ (epsilont = 1.9 +/- 0.1).
