 BACKGROUND: Direct antiglobulin test-negative (DAT(-)) autoimmune hemolytic anemia, characterized hemolysis without detectable immunoglobulin complement patient red blood cells (RBCs), poses diagnostic challenge. select therapy, classification hemolysis immune- non-immune-mediated important. developed method using Western immunoblot (WB) classify DAT(-) patients measuring comparing levels RBC immunoglobulin (Ig)G normal donors. STUDY DESIGN METHODS: RBC samples 42 normal donors made ghosts analyzed WB densitometry establish normal mean relative quantity IgG (RQIgG) RBCs. RQIgG eight DAT(-) eluate-negative patients hemolytic anemia determined compared RQIgG normal RBCs. RESULTS: RQIgG 42 normal donors indicated calculated mean +/- SD 0.0016 +/- 0.0015 used cutoff 0.0047, mean + 2SD. compared receiver operating curve cutoff 0.0041 100% sensitivity 93% specificity. eight patients tested, three classified non-immune-mediated (one pyruvate kinase deficiency) five immune-mediated. Two patients latter group underwent splenectomy, followed remission. CONCLUSION: WB analysis sensitive conventional test tube DAT elution analysis. assay confirms: 1) previous studies showing normal RBCs sensitized IgG, perhaps due natural autoantibody senescence; 2) normal RBCs increased levels IgG without signs disease; 3) WB distinguishes non-immune- immune-mediated hemolytic anemia DAT(-) patients may useful clinical diagnosis.
