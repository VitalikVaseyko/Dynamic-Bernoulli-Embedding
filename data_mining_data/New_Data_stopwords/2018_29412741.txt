 Warburg effect metabolic phenomenon characterized increased glycolytic activity, decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, production lactate. metabolic phenotype characterized rapidly proliferative cell types cancerous cells embryonic stem cells. hypothesized Warburg-like metabolism could achieved cell types treatment pharmacological agents, might, turn, facilitate nuclear reprogramming. aim study treat fibroblasts CPI-613 PS48 induce Warburg-like metabolic state. demonstrate treatment drugs altered expression 69 genes changed level 21 metabolites conditioned culture media, induce higher proliferation compared control treatment. results support role reverse Warburg effect, whereby cancer cells induce cancer-associated fibroblast cells surrounding stroma exhibit metabolically characterized Warburg effect. Cancer-associated fibroblasts produce secrete metabolites pyruvate supply cancerous cells, thereby supporting tumor growth metastasis. anticipating increase production lactate increased cellular proliferation, hallmarks Warburg effect, instead observed increased secretion pyruvate without changes proliferation.
