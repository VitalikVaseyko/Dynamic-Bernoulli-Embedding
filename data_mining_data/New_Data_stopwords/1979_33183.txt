 Experiments performed determine catecholamines regulate control points gluconeogenic pathway, mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylation pyruvate kinase activity, via alpha-adrenergic, adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-independent mechanism. number alpha agonists tested, norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine caused increase mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. effects catecholamines pyruvate carboxylation attenuated 1-propranolol abolishes changes cyclic nucleotide levels blocked alpha antagonists ergotamine, phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine. Time course experiments demonstrated effects catecholamines mitochondria carbohydrate metabolism correlated temporally concentration epinephrine medium small changes adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. effects catecholamines appeared require extracellular Ca2+ ion. observation catecholamines increase gluconeogenesis extent glucagon due differential effect mitochondrial CO2 fixation. Rather, catecholamines caused smaller inhibition pyruvate kinase activity glucagon. effects catecholamines pyruvate kinase also appeared mediated alpha-adrenergic, adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-independent mechanism.
