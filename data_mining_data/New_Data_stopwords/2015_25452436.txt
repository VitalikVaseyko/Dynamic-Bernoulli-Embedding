 STUDY QUESTION: high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) regulate inflammatory reactions rat model experimental autoimmune orchitis (EAO)? SUMMARY ANSWER: HMGB1 appears involved regulating inflammatory reactions testes, HMGB1 translocated testicular cells course EAO blocking action ethyl pyruvate (EP) reduces disease progression spermatogenic damage. KNOWN ALREADY: Despite immune privileged status, human testis prone inflammatory lesions associated male factor infertility. Accumulating evidence shows HMGB1 plays important role onset progression autoimmune diseases. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: cross sectional longitudinal study involving Wistar male rats immunized testicular homogenates induce EAO 50 (EAO50; n = 10) 80 (EAO80; n = 10) days first immunization. Control adjuvant animals received saline instead testicular homogenate (n = 16). Untreated animals (n = 10) also studied. interventional study performed block action HMGB1 starting 20 days first immunization EAO animals respective controls (n = 17). Rats treated i.p. EP effect EP treatment testicular pathogenesis evaluated 30 days later. Moreover, human testicular biopsies infertile men focal lymphocytic infiltrates (n = 7) sections intact spermatogenesis (n = 6) probed antibodies HMGB1. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Testicular RNA protein extracts EAO animals, EAO animals treated EP relevant controls used analysis cytokine expression real-time RT-PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HMGB1 co-localized rat testicular cross sections antibodies testicular macrophages (TM), peritubular cells (PTC) Sertoli cells (SC). Interaction HMGB1 receptors (RAGE, TLR4) well signaling pathways HMGB1 stimulation studied isolated TM, PTC SC proximity ligation assay western blot, respectively. Furthermore, HMGB1 immunofluorescence human testicular biopsies performed. MAIN RESULTS ROLE CHANCE: HMGB1 translocated nuclei EAO testes testes infertile men impaired spermatogenesis lymphocytic infiltrates. Elevated HMGB1 levels observed late phase EAO. testicular somatic cells HMGB1 receptors Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptor advanced glycation end products (RAGE) differentially expressed: HMGB1-TLR4 binding predominant TM, HMGB1-RAGE interaction prevalent SC PTC. support, HMGB1 triggered extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB) activation SC PTC, TM responded HMGB1 stimulation p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p65 nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-kB) phosphorylation followed increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNA levels. vivo treatment EAO animals EP 20 days induction disease revealed beneficial effects, documented reduced disease progression spermatogenic damage, lower macrophage numbers, well decreased concentrations HMGB1 IL-6 testis compared EAO controls. LIMITATIONS, REASONS CAUTION: ability HMGB1 bind wide range receptors makes difficult prevent action blockade specific receptor; therefore applied EP, drug preventing HMGB1 release cells. Due mode action EP decreases also secretion pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using isolated primary cells imposes limitations cell transfection studies. compromise purity yield primary cells need isolated animals different age, considered comparing responses. WIDER IMPLICATIONS FINDINGS: HMGB1 could promising target attenuating testicular damage caused inflammatory reactions.
