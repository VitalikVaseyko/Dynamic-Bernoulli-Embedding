 liver plays essential role maternal metabolic adaptation late pregnancy. regard lipid metabolism, increased secretion low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) characteristic late pregnancy. Despite well-described metabolic plasticity, molecular changes underlying hepatic adaptation pregnancy remain unclear. AMPK key intracellular energy sensor, investigated whether protein assumes causal role hepatic adaptation pregnancy. Pregnant Wistar rats treated vehicle AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) 5 days starting gestational day 14. end treatment, rats subjected intraperitoneal pyruvate tolerance test situ liver perfusion pyruvate. livers processed Western blot analysis, quantitative PCR, thin-layer chromatography, enzymatic activity, glycogen content measurements. Blood biochemical profiles also assessed. found AMPK ACC phosphorylation reduced livers pregnant rats parallel reduced level hepatic gluconeogenesis pyruvate. effect accompanied reduction levels hepatic triglycerides (TG) increase circulating levels TG. Treatment AICAR restored hepatic levels TG observed nonpregnant rats. Additionally, AMPK activation reduced upregulation genes related VLDL synthesis secretion observed livers pregnant rats. conclude increased secretion hepatic TG late pregnancy concurrent transcriptional profile favors VLDL production. transcriptional profile results reduction hepatic AMPK activity.
