 aim study assess role soluble non-starch polysaccharide (guar gum) white sea bream Diplodus sargus, glucose lipid metabolism. control diet formulated contain 40 % crude protein, 14 % crude lipids 35 % pregelatinized maize starch, three diets formulated similar control diet except guar gum, included 4 % (diet GG4), 8 % (diet GG8) 12 % (diet GG12). Diets fed fish 9 weeks pair-feeding scheme. Guar gum effect growth performance, feed efficiency, glycaemia, cholesterolaemia plasma triacylglyceride levels. Hepatic glucokinase pyruvate kinase activities, liver glycogen content liver insulin-like growth factor-I gene expression affected dietary guar gum, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity lower fish fed guar gum-supplemented diets. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity higher fish fed diets GG4 GG8 control group. Overall, data suggest contrast mammals guar gum effect white sea bream glucose utilization lowering plasma cholesterol triacylglyceride levels. However, seems contribute lower endogenous glucose production.
