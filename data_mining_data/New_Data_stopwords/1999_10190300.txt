 expression pyruvate kinase (PK) isoenzymes L M2 analysed livers rats treated hepatocarcinogenic agent N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM) drinking water. control animals L-PK expression restricted liver parenchymal cells, whereas M2-PK detected bile duct epithelial, blood vessel wall, endothelial Kupffer cells. rats treated NNM proliferating oval cells consistently L-PK negative M2-PK positive, ductal cells cholangiofibroses clearly L-PK positive coexpressed M2-PK. However, morphological differentiation ductal cells hepatocyte-like cells observed. clear acidophilic cell foci storing glycogen excess strong staining L-PK observed. glycogen-poor foci induced NNM shift L-PK M2-PK expression takes place.
