 Cells tumors use altered metabolic pattern compared normal differentiated adult cells body. Tumor cells take much glucose mainly process aerobic glycolysis, producing large quantities secreted lactate lower use oxidative phosphorylation would generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, carbon dioxide. Warburg effect, provides substrates cell growth division free energy (ATP) enhanced glucose use. metabolic switch places emphasis producing intermediates cell growth division, regulated oncogenes tumor suppressor genes number key cancer-producing pathways. Blocking metabolic pathways restoring altered pathways could lead new approach cancer treatments.
