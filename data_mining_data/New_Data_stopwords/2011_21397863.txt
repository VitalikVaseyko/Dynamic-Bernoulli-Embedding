 Tumor cells exhibit aberrant metabolism characterized high glycolysis even presence oxygen. metabolic reprogramming, known Warburg effect, provides tumor cells substrates required biomass generation. Here, show mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 crucial regulator Warburg effect. Mechanistically, SIRT3 mediates metabolic reprogramming destabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha), transcription factor controls glycolytic gene expression. SIRT3 loss increases reactive oxygen species production, leading HIF1alpha stabilization. SIRT3 expression reduced human breast cancers, loss correlates upregulation HIF1alpha target genes. Finally, find SIRT3 overexpression represses glycolysis proliferation breast cancer cells, providing metabolic mechanism tumor suppression.
