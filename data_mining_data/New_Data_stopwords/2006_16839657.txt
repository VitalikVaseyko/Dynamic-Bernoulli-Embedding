 Understanding functional genomics proteomics plasmodia underpins development new approaches antimalarial chemotherapy. Although genome databanks (e.g. PlasmoDB) biocomputing tools (e.g. PlasMit, PlasmoAP, PATS) useful providing global albeit predictive view myriad 5000 genes, 40% annotated, cases endorsed subcellular localizations corresponding proteins animal models. Progress plasmodial protein trafficking hampered lack simple yet reliable method studying subcellular localization plasmodial proteins. study, used combination fluorescent markers, organelle-specific probes, phase contrast microscopy, confocal microscopy locate selection signal peptides 10 plasmodial proteins CHO-K1 cells. eukaryotic cells serve vitro living system studying cellular destinations four mitochondrial-targeted TCA cycle proteins (citrate synthase, CS; isocitrate dehydrogenase, ICDH; branched chain alpha-keto-acid dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit, BCKDH; succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein-subunit, SDH), two nuclear-targeted proteins (histone deacetylase, HDAC; RNA polymerase, RPOL), two apicoplast-targeted proteins (pyruvate kinase 2, PK2; glutamate dehydrogenase, GDH), two cytoplasmic resident proteins (malate dehydrogenase, MDH; glycerol kinase, GK). respective localizations malarial proteins complied selected molecular targets, viz. mitochondrial, nuclear cytoplasmic. Interestingly, MDH widely known resident eukaryotic mitochondria found cytoplasmic, probably due absence molecular target sequences. Since localization plasmodial proteins central authentication pathophysiological roles, experimental system serve useful priori approach.
