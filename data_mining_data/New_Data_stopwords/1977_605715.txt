 changes sarcoplasmic proteins m. gastrocnemius m. soleus examined biochemical methods 5th, 7th, 14th 28th days plaster cast immobilization right hind limbs adult rabbits. 4 weeks soluble/myofibrillar protein ratio increased 0.47 0.75 m. gastrocnemius, 0.85 m. soleus. Evaluation relative quantities components identified gel-electrophoresis separation led following results: (1) no, appreciable change glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase enolase activities. (2) enzymes lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase glycogenolytic enzymes showed relative decrease muscles. (3) Phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglucose isomerase pyruvate kinase increased muscles. (4) Changes opposite directions exhibited myoglobin, myokinase F-protein. results provide new data biochemical characterization functionally different muscles, mechanism disuse atrophy.
