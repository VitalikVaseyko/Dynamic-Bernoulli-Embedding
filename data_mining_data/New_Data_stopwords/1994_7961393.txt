 Glycerol-glucose-fed (molar ratio 2) chemostat cultures Clostridium acetobutylicum glucose limited glycerol sufficient high intracellular NADH/NAD ratio (I. Vasconcelos, L. Girbal, P. Soucaille, J. Bacteriol. 176:1443-1450, 1994). report glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, one key enzymes glycolytic pathway, inhibited high NADH/NAD ratios. Partial substitution glucose pyruvate maintaining glycerol concentration constant level allowed higher consumption glycerol steady-state continuous cultures. However, glycerol-sufficient cultures constant flux glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase constant NADH/NAD ratio. high substitution glucose pyruvate [P/(G+P) value 0.67 g/g] provided carbon-limited culture butanol butyrate major end products. alcohologenic culture, induction NADH-dependent butyraldehyde ferredoxin-NAD(P) reductases higher expression alcohol dehydrogenases related high NADH/NAD ratio low intracellular ATP concentration. three different steady-state cultures, vitro phosphotransbutyrylase butyrate-kinase activities decreased intracellular ATP concentration, suggesting transcriptional regulation two genes, arranged operon (K. A. Walter, R. V. Nair, R. V. Carry, G. N. Bennett, E. T. Papoutsakis, Gene 134:107-111, 1993).
