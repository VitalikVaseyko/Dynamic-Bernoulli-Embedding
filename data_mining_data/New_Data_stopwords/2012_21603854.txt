 study analyzed differences karyotype genetic variation mutant wild-type Siraitia grosvenorii. Genetic variation included changes genome gene expression SRAP molecular markers. Results showed wild-type S. grosvenorii diploid, chromosome number 2n = 2x = 28, whereas mutant tetraploid chromosome number 2n = 4x = 56. 4573 DNA bands obtained using 189 different primer combinations, 577 polymorphic, averaging 3.1 bands primer pair, 1998 pairs identical. apparent differences bands amplified primer pairs. comparing diploid tetraploid strains, data generally indicated polymorphism would quite low. 2917 cDNA bands generated using 133 primer combinations, stable clearly differential fragments sorted out, cloned sequenced. Ninety-two differentially expressed fragments successfully sequenced. Sequence analysis showed fragments significant homologous nucleotide sequences resistant stress photosynthesis genes, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, peroxisomal membrane transporter, NBS-LRR type resistance protein, protein phosphatase others. results revealed tetraploid strain resistant photosynthesis ability diploid relatives, providing reference information resources molecular breeding seedless Luohanguo.
