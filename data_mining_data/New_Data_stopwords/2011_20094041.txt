 Although germ-line deletion c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) improves overall insulin sensitivity mice, studies could reveal underlying molecular mechanism tissue site(s) reduced JNK activity elicits observed phenotype. Given importance nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) glucose utilization, hypothesized insulin-sensitive phenotype associated Jnk deletion originates loss JNK function skeletal muscle. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated gene silencing used identify functions JNK subtypes regulating energy metabolism metabolic responses elevated concentrations NEFA C2C12 myotubes, cellular model skeletal muscle. show first time cellular JNK2- JNK1/JNK2-deficiency divert glucose oxidation glycogenesis due increased glycogen synthase (GS) activity induction Pdk4. show JNK2- JNK1/JNK2-deficiency profoundly increase cellular NEFA oxidation, conversion phospholipids triglyceride. increased NEFA utilization coupled increased expressions selective NEFA handling genes including Cd36, Acsl4, Chka, enhanced palmitic acid (PA)-dependent suppression acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc). JNK-intact cells, PA inhibited insulin signaling glycogenesis. Although silencing Jnk1 and/or Jnk2 prevented PA-induced inhibition insulin signaling, completely block decreased insulin-mediated glycogenesis, thus indicating JNK-independent pathways suppression glycogenesis PA. Muscle-specific inhibition JNK2 (or total JNK) improves capacity NEFA utilization glycogenesis, potential therapeutic target improving systemic insulin sensitivity type 2 diabetes (T2D).
