 Cancer cells tilt energy production away oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) toward glycolysis malignant progression, even aerobic metabolism available. Reversing phenomenon, known Warburg effect, may offer generalized anticancer strategy. study, show overexpression mitochondrial membrane transport protein UCP2 cancer cells sufficient restore balance toward oxidative phosphorylation repress malignant phenotypes. Altered expression glycolytic oxidative enzymes mediated effects metabolic shift. Notably, UCP2 overexpression increased signaling master energy-regulating kinase, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, downregulating expression hypoxia-induced factor. support recent new evidence UCP2 function, found UCP2 function setting membrane potential uncoupling protein, instead acted control routing mitochondria substrates. Taken together, results define strategy reorient mitochondrial function cancer cells toward OXPHOS restricts malignant phenotype.
