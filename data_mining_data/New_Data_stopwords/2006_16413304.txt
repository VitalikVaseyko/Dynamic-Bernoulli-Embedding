 Dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) compose diverse family proteins function, GTPase stimulated self-assembly, remodel cellular membranes. molecular mechanism DRPs mediate membrane remodeling events specific role GTPase cycle still fully understood. Although DRPs members GTPase superfamily, possess unique kinetic properties. particular, relatively low affinity guanine nucleotides and, conditions favor self-assembly, high rates GTP turnover. Established fixed time point assays used analysis assembly stimulated GTPase activity prone inaccuracies due substrate depletion also limited lack time resolution. describe simple, continuous, coupled GTP regenerating assay tackles limitations fixed time point assays used kinetic analysis DRP GTP hydrolysis unassembled assembled conditions.
