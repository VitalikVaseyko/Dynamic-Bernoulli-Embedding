 Mutants Escherichia coli K12 isolated grow media containing pyruvate proline sole carbon sources despite presence 10 50 mM-sodium fluoroacetate. mutants lack either acetate kinase [ATP: acetate phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.2.1] phosphotransacetylase [acetyl-CoA: orthophosphate acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.8] activity. Unlike wild-type E. coli, phosphotransacetylase mutants excrete acetate growing aerobically anaerobically glucose; anaerobic growth sugar slow. genes specify acetate kinase (ack) phosphotransacetylase (pta) activities cotransducible purF thus located min 50 E. coli linkage map. Although Pta- Ack- mutants greatly impaired growth acetate, incorporate [2-14C]acetate added cultures growing glycerol, glucose. inducible acetyl-CoA synthetase [acetate: CoA ligase (AMP-forming); EC 6.2.1.1] effects uptake acetate.
