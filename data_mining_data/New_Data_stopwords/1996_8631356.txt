 M1-type M2-type isozymes pyruvate kinase produced single gene mutually exclusive use exons 9 10. Selection exon 10 generates M2 type, occurs tissues, whereas M1 type expressed use exon 9 skeletal muscle, heart brain. investigated mechanism exon 10, exon 9 selected M2-expressing cells transfecting minigenes containing exon 9 and/or exon 10 cells analyzing transcripts using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Deletion conserved region intron 8 affect selection exon 10 dRLh-84 cells, express M2 type. Exclusion exon 10 minigene resulted two major spliced products. One included correctly spliced exon 9 skipped exon. Similar splicing patterns observed minigenes transfected hepatocytes express L type, M1 M2 types. 5' splice site 3' splice site exon 9 found hardly recognized splicing machinery dRLh-84 cells. Mutation 5' splice site sequence exon 9 exon 10 vice versa change splicing patterns. However, mutation site exon 9 perfectly complementary sequence U1 snRNA resulted selection exon 9 correctly spliced exon 10. 9-10 fusion exon (constructed substitution 68 bases 3' portion exon 9 33 bases 5' portion intron 9 corresponding regions exon 10 intron 10) also correctly incorporated major product together exon 10. Thus, propose exon 9 recognized non M1-expressing cells due weak signal 5' splice site that, although 5' splicing signal exon 10 also appears weak, exon recognized cells 5' recognition signal may relatively strengthened cis-acting element(s) may present 3' portion exon 9 5' portion intron 9 and/or corresponding regions exon 10 intron 10.
