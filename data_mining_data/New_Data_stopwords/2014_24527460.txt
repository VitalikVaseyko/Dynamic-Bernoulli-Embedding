 emerging body evidence chemoresistance minimal residual disease result selective resistance cell subpopulation original tumor molecularly phenotypically distinct. cells called "cancer stem cells" (CSCs). review, analyze potential targeting strategies eradicating CSCs specifically order develop effective therapeutic strategies metastatic colon cancer. include induction terminal epithelial differentiation CSCs targeting genes expressed CSCs involved self-renewal chemoresistance. Ideal targets could cell regulators simultaneously control stemness resistance CSCs. Another important aspect cancer biology, also harnessed create novel broad-spectrum anticancer agents, Warburg effect, also known aerobic glycolysis. Actually, little yet known regard metabolism CSCs population, leaving exciting unstudied avenue dawn emerging field metabolomics.
