 Oncogenic signaling reprograms cancer cell metabolism augment production glycolytic metabolites favor tumor growth. ability cancer cells evade immunosurveillance role metabolic regulators T-cell functions suggest oncogene-induced metabolic reprogramming may linked immune escape. EGF signaling, frequently dysregulated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), also associated increased glycolysis. Here, demonstrated TNBC cells EGF signaling activates first step glycolysis, impedes last step, leading accumulation metabolic intermediates pathway. Furthermore, showed one intermediates, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate (F1,6BP), directly binds enhances activity EGFR, thereby increasing lactate excretion, leads inhibition local cytotoxic T-cell activity. Notably, combining glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose EGFR inhibitor gefitinib effectively suppressed TNBC cell proliferation tumor growth. results illustrate jointly targeting EGFR/F1,6BP signaling axis may offer immediately applicable therapeutic strategy treat TNBC.
