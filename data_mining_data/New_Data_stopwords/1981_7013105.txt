 Glucose intolerance seen weight-losing patients may result qualitative quantitative alterations insulin secretion binding. may, however, result increased gluconeogenic flux occurs patients. may due increased substrate availability resulting lactate production unoxidized-end-product tumour glycolysis (Warburg effect). addition, increased levels glucogenic amino acid may associated preferential amino acid sequestration tumour, causing decreased muscle proteogenesis therefore atrophy. Enhanced glucose demand tumour cells may also lead increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, production ectopic ACTH.
