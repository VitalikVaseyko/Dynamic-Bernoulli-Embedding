 Many smooth muscles metabolic depletion undergo contraction insensitive EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)N,N-tetraacetic acid]. Chicken gizzard actomyosin shows progressive loss Ca sensitivity accompanied activation EGTA-Mg-ATPase temperatures near 37 degrees C decreasing ATP concentrations. Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation still occurs conditions ATPase Ca insensitive. Activation EGTA-Mg-ATPase low ATP concentration due pseudo-ATPase, due denautration actomyosin 37 degrees C. Magnesium concentrations 1 mM required observing enhanced EGTA-Mg-ATPase activity Ca sensitivity markedly influenced magnesium concentrations medium low ATP. Mg-to-ATP ratio (5:1) kept constant varying ATP concentrations, activation EGTA-ATPase observed. activation due characteristics ATP regenerating system (phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase) phosphocreatine creatine phosphokinase similar results obtained. Thus EGTA-insensitive rise tension metabolic depletion due activation Mg-ATPase loss Ca sensitivity 37 degrees C, temperature mammalian smooth muscles normally function.
