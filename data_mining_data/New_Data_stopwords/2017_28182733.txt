 BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests hypoxic areas bone marrow crucial maintenance hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) supporting quiescent state cell cycle regulating transplantation capacity long-term (LT)-HSCs. addition, HSCs seem express metabolic profile energy production away mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation favor glycolysis. oxygen deprivation, hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) known induce glycolytic enzymes well suppressing mitochondrial energy production inducing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (Pdk1) cell types. established whether PDK1 essential HSC function mediates hypoxia-adapting functions HSCs. Pdk gene family contains four members (Pdk1-4), recently shown Pdk2 Pdk4 important role regulating LT-HSCs. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: demonstrate PDK1 activity crucial transplantable HSC function. Whereas Pdkl, Pdk2, Pdk3 transcripts expressed higher levels different subtypes HSCs compared differentiated cells, could detect major differences expression LT-HSCs short-term HSCs multipotent progenitors. studying HIF-1alpha-mediated regulation Pdk activity vitro, Pdk1 robust target regulated hypoxia, whereas Pdk2, Pdk3, Pdk4 affected. Contrary, genetic ablation cre-inducible Hif-1alpha knockout mouse support link HIF-1alpha Pdk1. Silencing Pdk1 shRNA lentiviral gene transfer partially impaired progenitor colony formation vitro strong negative effect long-term short-term engraftment mice. CONCLUSIONS: study demonstrates PDK1 broad effects hematopoiesis critical factor engraftment HSCs multipotent progenitors upon transplantation recipient mice. Pdk1 robust hypoxia-inducible gene mediated HIF-1alpha vitro, could find evidence vivo links Pdk1 HIF-1alpha.
