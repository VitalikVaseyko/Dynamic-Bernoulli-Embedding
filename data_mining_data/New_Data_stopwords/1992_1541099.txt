 OBJECTIVE: investigate prognostic importance neurologic recovery lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) variables creatine kinase (CK) brain-type creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-BB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes (LDH 1-5), CSF acid phosphatase, beta-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, CSF lactate, pyruvate, sodium, potassium, calcium concentrations patients experienced cardiac arrest. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study blood CSF samples collected 4, 28, 76, 172 hrs resuscitation. SETTING: Medical ICU university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty consecutive victims out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Eight patients recovered neurologically 12 patients remained comatose neurologically disabled death. MEASUREMENTS MAIN RESULTS: CSF CK, CK-BB, LDH, LDH isoenzyme 1-3 concentrations disabled patients markedly increased 76 hrs resuscitation. However, variables changed recovered subjects. Patients (n = 7) mean CSF CK level 25 +/- 33 (SD) U/L, CK-BB 23 +/- 33 U/L, CSF lactate 3.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/L 28 hrs cardiac arrest remained unconscious died. recovered patients, mean CSF CK concentration 2.0 +/- 1.5 U/L (p less .001) CSF lactate concentration 2.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (p less .002). lactate concentration highest 4 hrs resuscitation, declining thereafter. Patients mean CSF total LDH level 609 +/- 515 U/L acid phosphatase 2.4 +/- 1.2 U/L 76 hrs resuscitation died without regaining consciousness. recovered patients, mean total CSF LDH activity 82 +/- 58 U/L (p = .003) CSF acid phosphatase 0.8 +/- 0.5 U/L (p = .01) 76 hrs resuscitation. CONCLUSIONS: CSF CK, CK-BB, CSF lactate concentrations reflect patient's outcome reliably measured within 28 76 hrs cardiac arrest. Similarly, CSF LDH, isoenzymes 1-3, CSF acid phosphatase concentrations, measured 76 hrs, used monitor patient's outcome cardiac arrest. correlated Glasgow Coma Scale scores, closest negative correlation seen CSF CK CK-BB 28 76 hrs, well LDH, LDH1-3, acid phosphatase values 76 hrs. negative correlation CSF lactate Glasgow Coma Scale scores distinct 28 hrs.
