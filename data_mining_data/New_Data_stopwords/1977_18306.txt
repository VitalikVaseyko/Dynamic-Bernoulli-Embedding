 several patients suffering congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia malignant hemotological disorder associated erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, metabolic study carried involving following biochemical determinations: assay red cell enzyme activities; estimation glucose consumption; measurement rate glycolytic intermediates; and, cases, enzyme purification characterization PK variant. Metabolic equilibrium probably depend kinetic characteristics PK molecules. Furthermore, data obtained allow separation cases congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia (hereditary defect) acquired PK deficiencies.
