 Though feedforward activation (FA) little known principle control metabolic networks, one well-known example; namely, activation pyruvate kinase (PK) fructose-1,6-biphosphate (FBP) glycolysis. effects activation enzyme's kinetics well characterised, possible role glycolytic control determined, and, experimentally, yet direct way modifying enzyme remove FBP activation without affecting aspects enzyme's kinetics. Given limitation, used detailed numerical simulation human erythrocyte glycolysis simulate effects selective removal activation PK FBP steady-state metabolite concentrations dynamic response glycolytic flux sudden increase cell's demand ATP. modelling results predict absence FA steady-state levels metabolites within activation loop, i.e. FBP phosphoenolpyruvate, would four- thirteen-fold higher normal, whereas levels ATP metabolites outside loop, i.e. glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate pyruvate, would lower normal. Existing clinical evidence patient haemolytic anaemia, correlated lack activation PK FBP (Paglia D.E., Valentine W.N., Holbrook C.T., Brockway R., Blood (1983) 62 972-979), consistent prediction. response changing demand ATP, model predicts corresponding change glycolytic flux would entail changes metabolite concentrations absence FA, presence levels metabolites within activation loop remain essentially unperturbed. Thus, results suggest stabilising metabolite pools face variable glycolytic flux, FA may serve avoid perturbations oxygen affinity haemoglobin (sensitive levels 2,3-phosphoglycerate) cell osmolality would otherwise occur variations cell's demand ATP. addition, significantly raising steady-state setpoint intermediate metabolite pools, productivity index (ratio glycolytic flux total metabolites pathway) glycolysis would fall almost four-fold absence forward activation.
