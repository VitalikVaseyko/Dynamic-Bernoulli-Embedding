 OBJECTIVE: test hypothesis free fatty acid (FFA) muscle glycogen modify exercise-induced regulation PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) human skeletal muscle regulation PDK4 expression. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: two occasions, healthy male subjects lowered (by exercise) muscle glycogen one leg (LOW) relative contra-lateral leg (CON) day experimental day. experimental days, plasma FFA ensured normal remained elevated consuming breakfast rich (low FFA) poor (high FFA) carbohydrate, 2 h performing 20 min two-legged knee extensor exercise. Vastus lateralis biopsies obtained exercise. RESULTS: PDK4 protein content approximately 2.2- approximately 1.5-fold higher LOW CON leg high FFA low FFA, respectively, PDK4 protein content CON leg approximately twofold higher high FFA low FFA. conditions, exercise increased PDHa (PDH active form) activity, resulting similar levels LOW leg trials CON leg high FFA, higher level CON leg low FFA. PDHa activity closely associated PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation level. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle glycogen plasma FFA attenuate exercise-induced PDH regulation human skeletal muscle nonadditive manner. might regulation PDK4 expression. activation PDH exercise independent changes muscle glycogen plasma FFA suggests exercise overrules FFA-mediated inhibition PDH (i.e., carbohydrate oxidation), may thus one mechanism behind health-promoting effects exercise.
