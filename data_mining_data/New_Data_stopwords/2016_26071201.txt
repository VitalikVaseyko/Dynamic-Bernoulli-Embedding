 report focal adhesion kinase (FAK) required optimal signalling Akt-p70S6K-S6 pathway squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. Specifically, SCCs genetically deficient FAK, reduced phosphorylation Akt, p70S6K S6, signalling Akt-p70S6K-S6 sensitive inhibition multiple agents suppress pathway. contrast, mTOR unaffected. Indeed, pharmacological agents inhibit Akt-p70S6K-S6 pathway, PDK1 lies upstream Akt, also impair autophagic targeting activated c-Src (p-Src) FAK deficient cells. associated loss complex p-Src autophagy protein LC3, biochemical surrogate impaired Src-selective autophagy. keeping vital role p70S6K, inhibition selective inhibitor specific siRNA also impaired Src-selective autophagy. Finally, components PDK1-Akt-p70S6K signalling pathway co-located p-Src autophagosomes, Src p70S6K co-exist biochemical complex. therefore deduce FAK-regulated signalling module PDK1-Akt-p70S6K controls Src's intracellular trafficking operates Src-containing autophagosomes.
