 data available activities canine erythrocyte enzymes 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG) concentrations pathological conditions heritable erythrocyte defects. diseases might affect erythrocyte metabolism oxygen transport, evaluated parameters 10 healthy dogs dogs symptomless dirofilariosis (n = 9), mild (n = 13) severe (n = 8) cardiac failure, haemolytic anaemia (n = 8). evaluate possible membrane damage, osmotic fragility red cells measured. haematological abnormalities found dogs mild cardiopathy symptomless dirofilariosis. Severe anaemia neutrophilic leucocytosis found dogs haemolytic anaemia and, lesser degree, severe heart failure. dogs two diseases, elevated values obtained were, respectively: pyruvate kinase (PK) 17.5 +/- 10.3 U/g haemoglobin (Hb) (P < 0.001) 11.6 +/- 7.5 U/g Hb (P < 0.01); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 8.9 +/- 5.4 U/g Hb (P < 0.001) 5.6 +/- 4.2 U/g Hb; 2,3DPG 21.8 +/- 4.9 U/g Hb (P < 0.001) 22.5 +/- 4.1 U/g Hb (P < 0.001). increased 2,3DPG concentrations may due diminished oxygen availability observed enzymatic changes attributed mainly presence young red blood cells: positive correlation nucleated red blood cells PK activity, G6PDH activity 2,3DPG concentration negative correlation mature erythrocytes PK activity, G6PDH activity 2,3DPG concentration. supported derivative curve fragiligram, showed two three peaks corresponding different erythrocyte populations negative correlation maximum haemolytic NaCl concentration reticulocyte number. measurement PK G6PDH activity 2,3PG concentration, together information provided fragiligram, would seem value defining clinico-haematological picture clinical heart diseases haemolytic anaemia.
