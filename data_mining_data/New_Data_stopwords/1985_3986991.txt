 enzymatic method measurement glycerol using glycerol kinase coupled pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase adapted COBAS-BIO centrifugal analyzer. Routine standardization required optimized conditions since calculation factor derived measurement pure glycerol standard found identical theoretical value. Excellent correlation method DuPont ACA triglyceride method obtained. coefficients variation within-run day-to-day precision less 4%. 2 microL serum required, making excellent means monitoring therapeutic glycerol administration premature infants hydrocephalus. method sensitivity measure glycerol concentrations low 0.1 mmol/L. This, together rapid analysis time (28 specimens 10 min), makes suitable correction glycerol interference measurement serum triglyceride.
