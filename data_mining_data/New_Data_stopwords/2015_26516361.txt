 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key enzyme Warburg effect, recently reported involved metabolic pathways chemotherapeutic drugs. However, role PKM2 breast cancer influence sensitivity front-line anticancer drugs remains unclear. METHODS: study, examined correlation expression PKM2 sensitivity primary breast cancer cells anticancer drugs. PKM2 expression studied immunohistochemistry using biopsy samples 296 patients diagnosed invasive breast carcinoma, collagen gel droplet embedded culture-drug sensitivity tests (CD-DST) conducted patients detect vitro chemosensitivity surgery. RESULTS: found high PKM2 expression significantly associated vitro chemosensitivity epirubicin (EPI) (P=0.019) 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) (P=0.009) breast cancer patients. used small group neoadjuvant chemotherapy cases confirm higher PKM2 expression, better pathological response therapy obtained patients treated EPI-based EPI plus 5-Fu chemotherapy regimens. Although univariate multivariate analysis indicated high PKM2 poor independent predictor progression free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS) breast cancer, patients PKM2 high expression received EPI-based EPI plus 5-Fu chemotherapy found longer PFS (P=0.003, P=0.013) OS (P=0.003, P=0.004) patients treated non-EPI/5-Fu-based regimens, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: findings confirmed poor prognosis high PKM2 expression breast cancer patients revealed predictive value high PKM2 therapeutic response EPI 5-Fu. Moreover, results provide guidance individual treatment breast cancer patients foreboded poor prognosis presence high PKM2 status.
