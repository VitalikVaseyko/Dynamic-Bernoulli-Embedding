 Escherichia coli, changes redox condition growth sensed signaled Arc two-component system. system consists ArcB membrane-associated sensor kinase ArcA cytoplasmic response regulator. ArcB tripartite kinase, possessing primary transmitter, receiver, secondary transmitter domain catalyzes phosphorylation ArcA via --> Asp --> --> Asp phosphorelay, well dephosphorylation ArcA-P reverse phosphorelay. ArcA ArcB incubated ATP, peak levels phosphorylated proteins increased presence fermentation metabolites D-lactate, acetate, pyruvate. study, report effectors accelerate autophosphorylation activity ArcB enhance transphosphorylation ArcA, effect dephosphorylation ArcA-P. Moreover, presence receiver domain ArcB essential effectors influence autophosphorylation rate primary transmitter domain ArcB.
