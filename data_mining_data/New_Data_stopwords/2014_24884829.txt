 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) essential aerobic glycolysis, dominant metabolic pathway utilized cancer cells. determine association PKM2 prostate cancer (PC), examined 29 primary PC three lymph node metastatic tumors; elevation PKM2 observed Gleason 8-10 tumors compared Gleason 6-7 carcinomas. High PKM2 detected immunohistochemistry aggressive xenograft tumors derived PC stem-like cells (PCSCs) compared produced non-PCSCs. PCSCs non-PCSCs expressed comparable levels PKM2, distinct posttranslational modifications observed. Collectively, upregulation specific modification PKM2 associate PC progression.
