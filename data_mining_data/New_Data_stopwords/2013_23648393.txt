 Understanding arsenic exacts diverse, global disease burden hampered limited understanding particular biological pathways disrupted arsenic underlie pathogenesis. reductionist view would predict small number basic pathways generally perturbed arsenic, manifest diverse diseases. Following initial observation arsenite-exposed cells culture acidify media rapidly control cells, report shows low level exposure arsenite (75ppb) sufficient induce aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) generalized phenomenon cultured human primary cells cell lines. Expanded studies one cell line, non-malignant pulmonary epithelial line, BEAS-2B, established arsenite-induced Warburg effect associated increased accumulation intracellular extracellular lactate, increased rate extracellular acidification, inhibition non-metabolized glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Associated induction aerobic glycolysis pathway-wide induction glycolysis gene expression, well protein accumulation established glycolysis master-regulator, hypoxia-inducible factor 1A. Arsenite-induced alteration energy production human cells represents type fundamental perturbation could extend many tissue targets diseases.
