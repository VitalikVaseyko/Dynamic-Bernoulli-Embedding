 Exemplified cancer cell's preference glycolysis (the Warburg effect), altered metabolism taken centerstage emerging hallmark cancer. Charting landscape cancer metabolic addictions reveal new avenues therapeutic attack. Two recent studies found subsets human melanoma breast cancers high levels phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), key enzyme serine biosynthesis, cancer cells dependent PHGDH growth survival. Tumors may thus harbor distinct metabolic alterations support malignancy, targeting enzymes PHGDH might prove viable therapeutic strategy scenario.
