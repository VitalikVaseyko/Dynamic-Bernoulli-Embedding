 chloromethyl ketone derivative lactic acid potent inhibitor glycolysis Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. inhibited glycolysis intact cells 50% 200 microM (100 nmol/mg protein) cell-free extracts inhibited 50% 50 microM (50 nmol/mg protein). N alpha-(p-Tosyl)-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone N alpha-(p-tosyl)-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone inhibited slightly concentration. inhibition localized hexokinase phosphofructokinase steps since two enzymes added inactivated extract restored glycolytic activity, whereas none glycolytic enzymes did. fact, addition pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, stimulated glycolysis, resulted pronounced inhibition. Glycolysis hexokinase activities extracts Rous sarcoma virus transformed cells considerably sensitive inhibitor activities normal chick embryo fibroblasts. Hexokinase mouse brain required 50 times higher concentrations inhibition enzyme mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Yeast hexokinase unaffected concentrations tested. Since 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) protected inhibition, chloromethyl ketone appeared inhibit interaction essential SH group. pronounced inhibition protein kinase activity plasma membranes Ehrlich ascites tumor cells observed presence chloromethyl ketone. case glycolysis, chloromethyl ketone lactic acid potent inhibitor protein kinase activity several chloromethyl ketones tested.
