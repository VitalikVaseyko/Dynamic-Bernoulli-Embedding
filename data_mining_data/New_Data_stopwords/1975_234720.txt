 vitro effects 2 water-soluble prednisolon-derivatives 10 Candida albicans 10 Candida tropicals species investigated. Tests performed resting proliferation phases. Changes cell metabolism measured O2-consumption Warburg technique. increasing corticosteroid concentrations (10-10000 gammaml) dose dependent increase cell respiration found without addition nutritive substrates. Even high concentrations corticosteroid cause antimetabolic effect. tests yield different results two Candida species examined.
