 Pathological oxygen deprivation inhibits prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) activity stimulates protective cellular oxygen-sensing response part stabilization activation Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) 1alpha transcription factor. present investigation tested therapeutic potential enhanced activation oxygen-sensing pathways competitive pharmacologic PHD inhibition stroke, hypothesizing post-ischemic PHD inhibition would reduce neuronal cell death require activation HIF-1alpha. PHD inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG, 100 muM) reduced cell death oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), vitro model ischemia, protection required HIF-1alpha. vivo, DMOG (50 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 30 60 min distal occlusion middle cerebral artery (MCA) mice enhanced activation HIF-1alpha protein, enhanced transcription HIF-regulated genes vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, reduced ischemic infarct volume activation pro-apoptotic caspase-3 protein, reduced behavioral deficits stroke, reduced loss local blood flow MCA territory stroke. Inhibition HIF-1alpha vivo Digoxin Acriflavine abrogated infarct sparing properties DMOG. data suggest supplemental activation oxygen-sensing pathways stroke may provide clinically applicable intervention promotion neurovascular cell survival ischemia.
