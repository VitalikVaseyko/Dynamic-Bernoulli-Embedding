 question whether separate "membrane" "soluble" pools ATP exist erythrocytes examined. Phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3)-derived ("membrane") ATP labeled short-term incubation inorganic [32P]phosphate. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40)-derived ("soluble")ATP labeled circumstances. specific activity gamma-phosphate "soluble" ATP evaluated addition 2-deoxyglucose measurement specific activity 2-deoxyglucose-6-[32P]phosphate formed. specific activity essentially overall specific activity erythrocyte ATP gama-phosphate, indicating functional pools phosphoglycerate kinase-derived pyruvate kinase-derived ATP exist erythrocytes.
