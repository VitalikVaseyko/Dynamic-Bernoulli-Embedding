 hypoxic conditions induced reduced blood flow decreases oxygen availability target tissues. Cellular hypoxia leads mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased energy production, increased production reactive oxygen species. determine alteration expression mitochondrial genes hypoxia cardiomyocytes, developed rodent mitochondrial gene chip (RoMitoChip). chip 1088 probe sets including 46 probe sets representing 37 mouse mitochondrial DNA transcripts remaining probe sets representing mouse nuclear genes contributing mitochondrial structure function. Mouse cardiomyocytes isolated neonatal C57BL/6 mice subjected hypoxia (1% oxygen) different time intervals demonstrated dichotomy expression profile tRNA mRNA transcripts. report total 483 signature genes altered hypoxia cardiac myocytes related mitochondrial structure function. includes 23 transcripts mitochondrial DNA. Pathway analysis demonstrated predominant changes expression genes involved oxidative phosphorylation, glucose fatty acid metabolism, apoptosis. upregulated genes 24 h hypoxia included hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit, inducible genes Bnip3, Pdk1, Aldoc. Whereas Bnip3 important cardiomyocyte death pathway, Pdk1 enzyme critical conserving mitochondrial function diverting metabolic intermediates glycolysis. study identifies participation two important pathways, cell death glycolytic, two key proteins, Bnip3 Pdk1, playing critical roles pathways cardiomyocytes severe hypoxia.
