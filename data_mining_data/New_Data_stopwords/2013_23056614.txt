 liver, glucose utilization lipid synthesis inextricably intertwined. glucose availability exceeds utilization, lipogenesis increases, leading increased intrahepatic lipid content lipoprotein secretion. Although fate three-carbon metabolites largely determined flux rate relevant enzymes, insulin plays permissive role process. mechanism integrating insulin receptor signaling glucose utilization lipogenesis unknown. Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), downstream effector insulin signaling, plays central role hepatic glucose metabolism regulation hepatic glucose production. study, investigated mechanism FoxO1 integrates hepatic glucose utilization lipid synthesis. show FoxO1 overexpression hepatocytes reduces activity carbohydrate response element binding protein (Chrebp), key regulator lipogenesis, suppressing O-linked glycosylation reducing protein stability. FoxO1 inhibits high glucose- O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)-induced liver-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promoter activity decreasing Chrebp recruitment L-PK promoter. Conversely, FoxO1 ablation liver leads enhanced O-glycosylation increased protein level Chrebp owing decreased ubiquitination. propose FoxO1 regulation Chrebp O-glycosylation mechanism linking hepatic glucose utilization lipid synthesis.
