 Human muscle cell cultures examined capacities oxidize several substrates, activities enzymes related intermediate metabolism. results indicate mitochondrial activities attained appreciable degrees maturity. specific activity creatine kinase increased myoblast fusion. contrast, parameters oxidative metabolism (palmitate pyruvate oxidation, cytochrome c oxidase citrate synthase) significantly change throughout myogenesis thereafter. differentiated cells (myotubes) oxidation capacities pyruvate greater 2-oxoglutarate greater malate (+ acetylcarnitine) greater malate (+ pyruvate), muscle biopsies. regard protein cultured human muscle cells showed higher activities original biopsies (= 100%) respect citrate synthase (179%), lower values cytochrome c oxidase (50%) creatine kinase (7%). Palmitate oxidation capacities systems. presence antimycin rotenon inhibited comparable extent palmitate oxidation cultured muscle biopsies.
