 Two auxotrophic mutants (SM16 SM51) Salmonella typhimurium, aerobic growth, hexoses carbon source, required lysine methionine (SM51 required also nicotinic acid), isolated characterized. requirement amino acids disappeared anaerobiosis. Neither lipoate 4-hydroxybenzoate effective supporting aerobic growth mutants. lysine methionine requirement aerobic growth due absence mutants enzymatic activities alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. mutants could use succinate carbon source even enrichment growth medium acid-hydrolyzed casein yeast extract. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity found mutants, phenomenon explained inability use succinate. interrupted conjugation transduction experiments, positions three affected loci, pck, suc, Nic, located approximately 17 19 min S. typhimurium chromosome; found closely linked. different criteria, appears genetic lesions present mutants due deletion small chromosome fragment.
