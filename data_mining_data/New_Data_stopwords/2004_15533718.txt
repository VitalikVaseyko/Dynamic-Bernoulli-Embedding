 Using NIH's public database dbEST expression genes ESTs, genes glycolysis pathway found overexpressed set 24 cancers representing 70% human cancer cases worldwide. Genes classified almost ubiquitously overexpressed, particularly glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase 1, also pyruvate kinase, overexpressed less 50% investigated cancers. Cancers classified overexpression majority glycolysis genes, particularly lymph node, prostate, brain cancer, essentially glycolysis genes overexpressed, sporadic overexpression, particularly cancers cartilage bone marrow. classification may useful cancer therapies aimed Warburg effect designed.
