 Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) specialized subset lymphoid effector cells critically involved allergic responses; however, mechanisms regulation remain unclear. report conditional deletion E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL innate lymphoid progenitors minimally affected early-stage bone marrow ILC2s caused selective intrinsic decrease mature ILC2 numbers peripheral non-lymphoid tissues, resulting reduced type 2 immune responses. VHL deficiency caused accumulation hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) attenuated interleukin-33 (IL-33) receptor ST2 expression, rectified HIF1alpha ablation inhibition. HIF1alpha-driven expression glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 downmodulated ST2 expression via epigenetic modification inhibited IL-33-induced ILC2 development. study indicates VHL-HIF-glycolysis axis essential late-stage maturation function ILC2s via targeting IL-33-ST2 pathway.
