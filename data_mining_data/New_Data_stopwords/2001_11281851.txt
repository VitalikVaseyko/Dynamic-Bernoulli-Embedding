 Concurrent spread western lifestyle, prevalence types diabetes rise world's population. number diabetics increasing 4-5% per year estimated 40-45% individual's age 65 years either type II diabetes impaired glucose tolerance. Since signs diabetes immediately obvious, diagnosis preceded extended period impaired glucose tolerance resulting prevalence beta-cell dysfunction macrovascular complications. addition increased medical vigilance, diabetes combatted aggressive treatment directed lowering circulating blood glucose inhibiting postprandial hyperglycemic spikes. Current strategies treat diabetes include reducing insulin resistance using glitazones, supplementing insulin supplies exogenous insulin, increasing endogenous insulin production sulfonylureas meglitinides, reducing hepatic glucose production biguanides, limiting postprandial glucose absorption alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. areas, new generations small molecules investigated exhibit improved efficacy safety profiles. Promising biological targets also emerging (1) insulin sensitizers including protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), (2) inhibitors gluconeogenesis like pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDH) inhibitors, (3) lipolysis inhibitors, (4) fat oxidation including carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) II inhibitors, (5) energy expenditure means beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists. Also important alternative routes glucose disposal Na+-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors, combination therapies, treatment diabetic complications (eg. retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy). may new opportunities drug discovery, prospects excellent development innovative therapies effectively manage diabetes prevent long term complications. review highlights recent (1997-2000) advances diabetes therapy research emphasis small molecule drug design (275 references).
