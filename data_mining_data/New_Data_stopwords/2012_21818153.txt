 Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) commonly prescribed class insulin sensitizing drugs increase fatty acid re-esterification, part induction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Owing deleterious side effects TZDs identification alternative approaches increase PDK4 essential. recently demonstrated epinephrine increases PDK4 expression p38 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) dependent pathways cultured adipose tissue lean rats. purpose study determine whether acute epinephrine treatment, vivo, induce PDK4 mRNA expression adipose tissue obese, insulin resistant rats reputed signaling pathways mediating effect intact. end fed male Wistar rats chow high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcals fat) 6 weeks. Rats injected weight-adjusted bolus epinephrine tissue harvested. Despite blunted activation p38 epinephrine increased PDK4 mRNA expression similar extent adipose tissue chow HFD rats. 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling altered HFD. Similar epinephrine, 2 h swim exercise, intervention increases plasma catecholamines, also increased PDK4 mRNA levels similar extent adipose tissue lean HFD rats. Collectively findings demonstrate, first time, acute elevations catecholamines induce PDK4 adipose tissue HFD rats, effect likely independent p38, reputed mediator PDK4 expression exercise, similar TZDs induce PDK4 adipose tissue obese, insulin resistant rats.
