 Male Wistar rats chronically (15 weeks) fed sucrose-rich diet (SRD; 63% w/w) developed hypertriglyceridemia impaired glucose homeostasis. Hearts animals isolated perfused using Langendorff recirculating method. Glucose levels similar found animal vivo used exogenous substrate. hearts perfused 30 minutes presence absence insulin (30 mU/mL) perfusion medium. absence hormone, glucose uptake impaired glucose utilization reduced, significant increase lactate release. Glucose oxidation, estimated activation state enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), depressed mainly due increase PDH kinase decrease PDHa (active form PDHc) activities. Although addition insulin perfusion medium improved parameters, unable normalize them. present results suggest least two different mechanisms might contribute insulin resistance impaired glucose metabolism perfused hearts dyslipemic SRD-fed animals: (1) reduced basal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake utilization (2) increased availability oxidation lipids (low PDHa high PDH kinase activities), turn decrease glucose uptake utilization. Thus, nutritional experimental model may useful study impaired glucose homeostasis, increases plasma free fatty acid levels hypertriglyceridemia could contribute heart tissue malfunction.
