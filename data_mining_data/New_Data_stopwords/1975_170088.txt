 substrate binding sites pyruvate kinase studied means spectrophotometric investigations. Two binding sites, one nucleotide substrate one acceptor, characterized. interaction nucleotide substrates enzyme, metal-dependent, results perturbation spectrum nucleotide chromophore characterized hypochromic red shift effects; hydrophobicity nucleotide site estimated using reporter group reagent, 2-(dansylamino)ethyl monophosphate. comparison binding sites several ATP phosphotransferases discussed common features reported.
