 compared solubility, kinetic, immunological, electrophoretic properties erythrocyte pyruvate kinase normal dogs Basenji dogs congenital hemolytic anemia due pyruvate kinase deficiency. Differences detected two enzymes methods. enzyme affected animals greater solubility ammonium sulfate. lower Km phosphoenolpyruvate, Km ADP increased. enzyme inhibited ATP activated fructose 1,6-diphosphate. enzyme affected animals none allosteric properties characteristic normal canine enzyme. difference detected enzyme inactivation rabbit antiserum human erythrocyte enzyme, slight spur observed comparison two enzymes Ouchterlony immunodiffusion. enzymes also differ electrophoretic mobilities starch gel electrophoresis.
