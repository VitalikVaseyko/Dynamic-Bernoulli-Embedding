 Brain functioning mainly intrinsic, primarily reflexive. supported high energy requirements resting brain (20% energy consumed) marginally increases changes brain activity. Modern neuroimaging neurophysiological techniques led discovery called brain default mode network (DMN), constellation brain regions support brain activity rest whose discharges decrease task-induced activities. Another characteristic DMN elevated levels aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), is, metabolism glucose lactic acid presence sufficient leveis oxygen. Alzheimer's disease amyloid deposition metabolic disruption DMN regions. Changes connectivity among different nodes DMN connections hippocampus reported. characteristics DMN relation Alzheimer's disease discussed. issue interest pathogenesis possibly usefulness biomarker disease.
