 Since administration ATP-MgCl2 following trauma hemorrhagic shock improves tissue perfusion well cell organ function, aim study determine whether agent salutary effects hepatic rate-controlling enzymes specific gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glycolysis, pyruvate kinase (PK), conditions. study this, rats underwent 5-cm midline laparotomy (i.e., trauma-induced) bled maintained mean arterial pressure 40 mm Hg 40% maximum bleed volume returned form Ringer's lactate (RL). animals resuscitated 3 times volume shed blood RL 45 min, followed 2 times RL ATP-MgCl2 (50 micromol/kg body wt.) equivalent volume normal saline 95 min. Hepatic PEPCK, PK glucokinase activities determined 4 h completion resuscitation. mRNA levels PEPCK PK isolated hepatocytes determined Northern blot analysis. results indicate glucokinase activity significantly altered hemorrhage, irrespective ATP-MgCl2 treatment. Although mRNA levels PEPCK similar groups, PEPCK activity decreased significantly hemorrhage. ATP-MgCl2 treatment, however, restored PEPCK activity. Hemorrhage resulted increase PK activity mRNA. ATP-MgCl2 treatment significantly decreased PK activity mRNA. Thus, up-regulation gluconeogenic enzyme, PEPCK, down-regulation glycolytic enzyme, PK, ATP-MgCl2 may responsible, part, beneficial effects agent following trauma-hemorrhage resuscitation.
