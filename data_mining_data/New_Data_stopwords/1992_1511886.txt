 dimorphic yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica, developed useful expression/secretion system heterologous proteins chymosin tissue plasminogen activator. develop expression system, cloned gene (PYK) encoding highly expressed glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (PYK). Genomic clones selected specific hybridization synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes based regions enzyme conserved evolution. clones identified hybridization contained overlapping DNA inserts. confirmed identity cloned gene based two criteria: (1) nucleotide sequence proposed PYK gene predicts protein highly homologous corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme, (2) PYK-specific activity increased twofold wild-type Y. lipolytica strains transformed isolated DNA. Interestingly, found open reading frame Y. lipolytica PYK gene interrupted intron. represents first report intron Y. lipolytica gene.
