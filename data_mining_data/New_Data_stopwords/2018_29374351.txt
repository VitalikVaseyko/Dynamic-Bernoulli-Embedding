 PURPOSE: Increasing evidence shows altered metabolism critical hallmark colon cancer. strong need explore molecular mechanisms underlying cancer metabolism. Whether aberrant expression microRNAs contributes cancer metabolism fully understood. miR-328 putative potential target SLC2A1, regulating mechanism remains unknown. examined whether miR-328 directly regulates SLC2A1/GLUT1 expression colon cancer cells. METHODS: performed silico bioinformatic analyses identify miR-328-mediated molecular pathways targets. also performed luciferase assays western blot analyses LOVO SW480 colon cancer cell lines. addition, assessed miR-328 expression 47 paired tumor normal tissue specimens resected colon cancer patients. RESULTS: Luciferase reporter assays showed miR-328 directly targeted SLC2A1 3'-untranslated region (UTR), significant decrease luciferase activity LOVO SW480 cell lines. results validated western blot. miR-328 expression significantly downregulated tumor tissue compared paired normal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: results show miR-328 targets SLC2A1/GLUT1. suggest miR-328 may involved orchestration Warburg effect colon cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-328 expression reduced colon cancer patients thus inversely correlates classically reported upregulated SLC2A1/GLUT1 expression tumors.
