 Ethyl pyruvate (EP) simple aliphatic ester metabolic intermediate pyruvate demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory agent variety vivo vitro model systems. However, protective effects mechanisms underlying actions EP endothelial cell (EC) inflammatory injury fully understood. Previous studies confirmed endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays important role regulating pathological process EC inflammation. study, aim explore effects EP tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced inflammatory injury human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) explore role ERS process. TNF-alpha treatment significantly increased adhesion monocytes HUVECs inflammatory cytokine (sICAM1, sE-selectin, MCP-1 IL-8) production cell culture supernatants also increased ICAM MMP9 protein expression HUVECs. TNF-alpha also effectively increased ERS-related molecules HUVECs (GRP78, ATF4, caspase12 p-PERK). EP treatment effectively reversed effects TNF-alpha-induced adhesion monocytes HUVECs, inflammatory cytokines ERS-related molecules. Furthermore, thapsigargin (THA, ERS inducer) attenuated protective effects EP TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory injury ERS. PERK siRNA treatment inhibited ERS-related molecules also mimicked protective effects EP decrease TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory injury. summary, demonstrated first time EP effectively reduce vascular endothelial inflammation effect least part depends attenuation ERS.
