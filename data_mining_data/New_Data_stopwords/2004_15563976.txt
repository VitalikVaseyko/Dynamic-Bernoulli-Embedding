 development type 1 diabetes results almost total destruction insulin-producing pancreatic cells autoimmune responses specific cells. Standard insulin therapy may maintain blood glucose concentrations within relatively narrow range occurs presence normal pancreatic cells. used recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) expresses single-chain insulin analogue (SIA), possesses biologically active insulin activity without enzymatic conversion, control hepatocyte-specific l-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) promoter, regulates SIA expression response blood glucose levels. Here, show SIA produced gene construct rAAV-LPK-SIA caused remission diabetes streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats autoimmune diabetic mice prolonged time without apparent side effects. new SIA gene therapy may potential therapeutic value cure autoimmune diabetes humans.
