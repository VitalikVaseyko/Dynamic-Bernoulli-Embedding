 evaluated whether insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase activity required activation PDH, insulin-induced hydrolysis PIG generation IG 1,2-DAG. analysis, used stable-transfected CHO cell lines expressing wild-type human insulin receptor (CHO-wt cells) mutant receptor (Val996) lacks tyrosine kinase activity (CHO-mut cells) (1,2). Insulin stimulated PDH activity three CHO cell lines dose-dependent manner. Half-maximal concentrations insulin activate PDH 7 x 10(-11) CHO-wt cells, 10(-9) parental cells, 8 x 10(-9) CHO-mut cells. Insulin stimulated hydrolysis PIG generation IG DAG three CHO cell lines dose-dependent manner. Half-maximal concentrations insulin induce generation IG 8 x 10(-11) CHO-wt cells, 10(-9) parental CHO cells, 10(-8) CHO-mut cells. ED50 stimulation DAG generation 7 x 10(-11) CHO-wt cells, 10(-9) parental cells, 10(-8) CHO-mut cells. concluded insulin-dependent PDH activation, PIG hydrolysis, IG DAG generation mediated wild-type mutated insulin receptor Val996. study suggests tyrosine kinase activity insulin receptor might prerequisite insulin-stimulated generation IG DAG.
