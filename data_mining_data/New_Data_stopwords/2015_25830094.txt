 OBJECTIVE: peptide hormone adropin regulates fuel selection preferences skeletal muscle fed fasted conditions. Here, investigated whether adropin treatment ameliorate dysregulation fuel substrate metabolism, improve aspects glucose homeostasis diet-induced obesity (DIO) insulin resistance. METHODS: DIO C57BL/6 mice maintained 60% kcal fat diet received five intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections bioactive peptide adropin(34-76) (450 nmol/kg/i.p.). Following treatment, glucose tolerance whole body insulin sensitivity assessed indirect calorimetry employed analyze whole body substrate oxidation preferences. Biochemical assays performed skeletal muscle samples analyzed insulin signaling action substrate oxidation. RESULTS: Adropin treatment improved glucose tolerance, enhanced insulin action augmented metabolic flexibility towards glucose utilization. muscle, adropin treatment increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation cell-surface expression GLUT4 suggesting sensitization insulin signaling pathways. Reduced incomplete fatty acid oxidation increased CoA/acetyl-CoA ratio suggested improved mitochondrial function. underlying mechanisms appear involve suppressions carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1B (CPT-1B) CD36, two key enzymes fatty acid utilization. Adropin treatment activated pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), rate-limiting enzyme glucose oxidation, downregulated PDH kinase-4 (PDK-4) inhibits PDH. Along changes, adropin treatment downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha regulates expression Cpt1b, Cd36 Pdk4. CONCLUSIONS: Adropin treatment DIO mice enhances glucose tolerance, ameliorates insulin resistance promotes preferential use carbohydrate fat fuel selection. Skeletal muscle key organ mediating adropin's whole-body effects, sensitizing insulin signaling pathways altering fuel selection preference favor glucose suppressing fat oxidation.
