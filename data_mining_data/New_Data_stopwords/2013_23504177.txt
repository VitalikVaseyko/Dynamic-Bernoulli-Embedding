 Oxidative stress plays major role pathogenesis heart failure, contractile response beta-adrenergic stimulation profoundly depressed. condition involves L-type Ca(2+) channels, mechanisms underlying impaired adrenergic regulation unclear. Thus present study explored basis impaired adrenergic control Ca(2+) channels rat infarction model heart failure. Patch-clamp recordings L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) ventricular myocytes isolated infarcted hearts showed blunted response intracellular cAMP reversed treatment exogenous pyruvate. Biochemical studies showed basal cAMP-stimulated protein kinase activities similar infarcted sham-operated hearts, whereas molecular analysis also found binding protein kinase alpha(1C) subunit voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel isoform 1.2 different groups. contrast, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity binding alpha(1C) significantly less infarcted hearts. PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid markedly increased I(Ca,L) sham-operated myocytes, response significantly less myocytes infarcted hearts. However, pyruvate normalized I(Ca,L) stimulation okadaic acid, effect blocked inhibitors thioredoxin reductase, implicating functional role redox-active thioredoxin system. data suggest blunted beta-adrenergic stimulation I(CaL) failing hearts results hyperphosphorylation Ca(2+) channels secondary oxidation-induced impairment PP2A function. propose redox state Ca(2+) channels PP2A controlled thioredoxin system plays key role Ca(2+) channel remodeling failing heart.
