 UNLABELLED: Patient Male, 81 FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma Symptoms: General weakness * hypoglycemia * metabolic acidosis MEDICATION: - Clinical Procedure: - Specialty: Hematology. OBJECTIVE: Challenging differential diagnosis. BACKGROUND: B cell lymphoma constitutes 80-85% cases Non Hodgkin's lymphoma Untied States. Metabolic complications may arise disease end organ involvement. CASE REPORT: describe case diffuse large B cell lymphoma diagnosed abdominal computed tomography initially presented hypoglycemia correctable dextrose infusion instead resulted increased anion gap metabolic acidosis elevated lactate levels. CONCLUSIONS: case illustrates lymphomas present unusually hypoglycemia lactic acidosis, latter ominous sign occur without liver involvement. regard, case demonstrates metabolic sequelae lymphoma raise suspicion underlying process. implications diagnosis, treatment, patient survival. Attention paid especially primary care setting order minimize delays diagnosis.
