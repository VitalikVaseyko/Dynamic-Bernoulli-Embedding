 BACKGROUND: Prednisone, one highly prescribed drugs, well characterized effects gene transcription mediated glucocorticoid receptor. effects typically occurring scale hours. Prednisone also number non-transcriptional effects (occurring minutes scale) protein signaling, yet less well studied. sought expand understanding acute effects prednisone action cell signaling using combination SILAC strategy subcellular fractionations C2C12 myotubes. RESULTS: De novo translation proteins inhibited SILAC labeled unlabeled C2C12 myotubes. Unlabeled cells exposed prednisone SILAC labeled cells remained untreated. 0, 5, 15, 30 minutes prednisone exposure, labeled unlabeled cells mixed 1:1 ratios fractionated cytosolic nuclear fractions. total 534 proteins cytosol 626 proteins nucleus identified quantitated, using 3 peptides per protein peptide based probability < = 0.001. identified significant increases (1.7- 3.1- fold) cytoplasmic abundance 11 ribosomal proteins within 5 minutes exposure, returned baseline 30 min. hypothesized drug-induced acute changes subcellular localization cell's protein translational machinery could lead altered translation quiescent RNAs. test this, de novo protein synthesis assayed 15 minutes drug exposure. Quantitative fluorography identified 16 2D gel spots showing rapid changes translation; five identified MS/MS (pyruvate kinase, annexin A6 isoform isoform B, nasopharyngeal epithelium specific protein 1, isoform 2 Replication factor C subunit 1), showed 5' terminal oligopyrimidine motifs associated mRNA sequestration inactive mRNA pools. CONCLUSION: describe novel approaches subcellular proteomic profiling assessment acute changes minute-based time scale. data expand current knowledge acute, non-transcriptional activities glucocorticoids, including changes protein subcellular localization, altered translation quiescent RNA pools, PKC-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling.
