 BACKGROUND: Patients' quality life restorative proctocolectomy depends potential complications. Stricture ileal pouch-anal anastomosis one complications following restorative proctocolectomy. MATERIAL/METHODS: analyzed correlation diameter anastomosis clinical parameters, including pouchitis disease activity index (PDAI), activity fecal M2-pyruvate kinase maximum tolerable volume pouch. study group consisted 31 patients covering ileostomy closed 72 +/- 50 months enrolement study. Restorative proctocolectomy ulcerative colitis familial adenomatous polyposis coli performed group. RESULTS: study show correlation diameter anastomosis primary indication surgery, time elapsed restoration bowel continuity, activity fecal M2-pyruvate kinase, maximum tolerable volume. However, meaningful correlations stricture anastomosis presence activity pouchitis, together ileal villi atrophy, detected. CONCLUSIONS: Stricture anastomosis appears important factor increasing incidence pouchitis, independent underlying condition time operation. Dilation anastomosis prevention stricture constitute permanent element postoperative follow-up.
