 BACKGROUND: primary cause skin cancer ultraviolet (UV) light sun. Keratinocytes predominant cell type epidermis form barrier environmental damage, especially UV light irradiation. Autophagy self-digestion mechanism energy homeostasis critical times development response stress. High-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) highly conserved nuclear protein associated cell autophagy. OBJECTIVE: investigated role HMGB1 keratinocytes exposed UV irradiation regulation keratinocyte autophagy. METHODS: Specimens UV-exposed human skin assayed immunohistochemically HMGB1. HaCaT immortalized human keratinocytes used investigate mechanism HMGB1 translocation induced UV irradiation. Levels cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) determined H2DCF assay, apoptosis assayed flow cytometry western-blot lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting HMGB1 keratinocytes UV irradiation. Phosphorylated-Erk1/2 expression assayed western blotting. RESULTS: HMGB1 receptor (receptor advanced glycation end products, RAGE) expressed HaCaT cells, HMGB1 transferred nucleus cytoplasm UV irradiation HaCaT human skin keratinocytes. Knockdown HMGB1 expression lentivirus-mediated shRNA limited UV-induced autophagy led increased apoptosis HaCaT cells. Pharmacological inhibition HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation agents ethyl pyruvate limits starvation-induced autophagy. UV irradiation led phosphorylation Erk1/2 HaCaT cells. Inhibition RAGE Erk1/2 limited HaCaT cell autophagy. CONCLUSION: Autocrine HMGB1 modulated HaCaT autophagy via RAGE/HMGB1/extracellular signal-regulated Erk1/2-dependent pathway protect keratinocytes apoptosis UV irradiation.
