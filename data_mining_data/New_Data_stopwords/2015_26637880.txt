 BACKGROUND/AIM: Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized fumarate hydratase (FH) gene mutation. associated development aggressive kidney tumors, characterized early onset high metastatic potential, effective therapy. aim study establish new preclinical platform investigating morphogenetic metabolic features, alternative therapy metastatic hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma type 2 (PRCC2). MATERIALS METHODS: Fresh cells collected pleural fluid patient metastatic hereditary PRCC2. Morphogenetic functional characteristics evaluated via microscopy, FH gene sequencing analysis, real-time polymerase chaine reaction enzymatic activity measurement. performed bioenergetic analysis, gene-expression profiling, cell viability assay 19 anti-neoplastic drugs. RESULTS: established new vitro model hereditary PRCC2 - NCCFH1 cell line. cell line possesses c.1162 delA - p.Thr375fs frameshift mutation FH gene. findings indicate severe attenuation oxidative phosphorylation glucose-dependent growth NCCFH1 cells consistent Warburg effect. Furthermore, gene-expression profiling identified prominent molecular features reflected high level apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell signaling. Drug screening revealed marked sensitivity FH(-/-) cells mitoxantrone, epirubicin, topotecan high sensitivity bortezomib. CONCLUSION: demonstrated NCCFH1 cell line interesting preclinical model studying metabolic features testing new therapies hereditary PRCC2, bortezomib may potential efficient therapeutic option.
