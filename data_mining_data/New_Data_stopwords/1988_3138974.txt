 short-term interactions insulin vasopressin pyruvate kinase (PK) activity studied primary cultures rat hepatocytes. (1) Vasopressin inhibited PK activity approx. 30% within 15 s, activity returned control values 5 min. transient inhibition vasopressin mimicked either 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) ionophore A23187. (2) Insulin alone transiently inhibited PK activity 1 min, stimulated PK activity 5 15 min. (3) Insulin completely antagonized early inhibition vasopressin, PMA A23187 PK activity 15 s. (4) Insulin inhibited PK activity presence vasopressin, PMA A23187 5 min. (5) 8-Bromo cyclic AMP inhibited PK activity within 15 s, inhibition maintained least 5 min. Insulin antagonized inhibition cyclic AMP analogue. results show insulin appropriate conditions act inhibitor activator PK.
