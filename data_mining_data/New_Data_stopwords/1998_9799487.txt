 Isozymes pyruvate kinase (PK) expressed rabbit muscle kidney show different allosteric kinetics. amino acid changes two isozymes, originating alternative RNA splicing, occur stretch 55 amino acids C domain near subunit interface. self-correcting distance geometry (SECODG) program DIAMOD used calculate homology model interfacial contacts four helix bundle kidney PK dimer, based X-ray structure tetrameric rabbit muscle PK [Larsen et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 6301-6309]. Energy refinement program FANTOM, using ECEPP/2 force field assess packing electrostatic interactions two subunits, yielded two groups energetically favorable conformations. primary difference two groups loop conformation residue Pro 402, serine muscle PK. one loop conformation, conserved Lys 421 form intersubunit salt bridge observed muscle PK crystal structure. loop conformation favors alternative intrasubunit salt bridge, similar found Escherichia coli PK structure, used generating model. intersubunit salt bridge leads intersubunit hydrogen bonding Lys 421 one subunit Tyr 443 other. provide direct evidence roles residues, site-directed mutagenesis muscle PK gene conducted. Converting Ser 402 proline Tyr 443 phenylalanine changed neither secondary tetrameric structure, measured far UV-CD sedimentation velocity, respectively. However, S402P mutant exhibits steady-state kinetics, indicating mutant reponsive regulation effectors, mutant Y443F essentially equivalent wild-type muscle PK protein except lower affinity phosphoenolpyruvate. findings suggest pivotal role key residues allosteric regulation PK.
