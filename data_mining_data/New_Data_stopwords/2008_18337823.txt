 Many tumour cells elevated rates glucose uptake reduced rates oxidative phosphorylation. persistence high lactate production tumours presence oxygen, known aerobic glycolysis, first noted Otto Warburg 75 yr ago. tumour cells establish altered metabolic phenotype whether essential tumorigenesis yet unknown. show single switch splice isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase necessary shift cellular metabolism aerobic glycolysis promotes tumorigenesis. Tumour cells shown express exclusively embryonic M2 isoform pyruvate kinase. use short hairpin RNA knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 expression human cancer cell lines replace pyruvate kinase M1. Switching pyruvate kinase expression M1 (adult) isoform leads reversal Warburg effect, judged reduced lactate production increased oxygen consumption, correlates reduced ability form tumours nude mouse xenografts. results demonstrate M2 expression necessary aerobic glycolysis metabolic phenotype provides selective growth advantage tumour cells vivo.
