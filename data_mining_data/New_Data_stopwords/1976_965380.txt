 Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40, ATP-pyruvate phosphotransferase) found display time-dependent activation (lag phase) reaction progress curves. extent lag phase depended upon treatment enzyme prior assay. Preincubation enzyme adenine nucleotides amplified lag, whereas prior treatment phosphoenolpyruvate diminished it. activation process first order enzyme pseudo first order rate constants hyperbolic function phosphoenolpyruvate concentration. data provide evidence phosphoenol-pyruvate-mediated conversion enzyme active form. Studies irreversible sulfhydryl inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (MalNEt), provided additional evidence different conformational states enzyme induced substrates effectors. Adenine nucleotides found promote inactivation MalNEt phosphoenolpyruvate protected MalNEt. possible metabolic significance "hysteretic" pyruvate kinase discussed relation known role enzyme 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate metabolism (Rose, I.A. (1971) Exp. Eye Res. 11, 264-272).
