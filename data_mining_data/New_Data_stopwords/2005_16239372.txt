 Long (6- 9-mo) bouts estivation green-striped burrowing frogs lead 28% atrophy cruralis oxidative fibers (P < 0.05) impairment vitro gastrocnemius endurance (P < 0.05) significant deficit maximal twitch force production. data suggest preferential atrophy oxidative fibers rate slower than, comparable to, laboratory disuse models. tested hypothesis frog limits atrophy modulating oxidative stress. assayed various proteins transcript level verified results antioxidant enzymes biochemical level. Transcript data NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit 1 (71% downregulated, P < 0.05) ATP synthase (67% downregulated, P < 0.05) consistent mitochondrial quiescence reduced oxidant production. Meanwhile, uncoupling protein type 2 transcription (P = 0.31), thought reduce mitochondrial leakage reactive oxygen species, maintained. Total antioxidant defense water-soluble (22.3 +/- 1.7 23.8 +/- 1.5 microM/microg total protein control estivator, respectively, P = 0.53) membrane-bound proteins (31.5 +/- 1.9 42.1 +/- 7.3 microM/microg total protein control estivator, respectively, P = 0.18) maintained, equivalent bolstering defense relative oxygen insult. probably decelerates muscle atrophy preventing accumulation oxidative damage static protein reserves. Transcripts mitochondrially encoded antioxidant superoxide dismutase type 2 (67% downregulated, P < 0.05) paralleled mitochondrial activity, whereas nuclear-encoded catalase glutathione peroxidase maintained control values (P = 0.42 P = 0.231), suggesting dissonance mitochondrial nuclear antioxidant expression. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 transcription fourfold lower estivators (P = 0.11), implying that, contrast mammalian hibernators, enzyme drive combustion lipids helps spare hypometabolic muscle.
