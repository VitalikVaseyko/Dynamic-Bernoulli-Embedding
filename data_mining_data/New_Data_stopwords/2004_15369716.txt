 OBJECTIVES: determine measuring ratio glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) pyruvate kinase (PK) reliable measuring G6PD activity identify heterozygous G6PD- individuals associated microcytic anemia Calabrian population, shows high frequencies thalassaemia (thal) trait G6PD deficiency. DESIGN METHODS: Measurement G6PD PK activities carried 205 samples whole blood Calabrian subjects sexes (age range 10-50 years) using double starter differential pH-metry technique. RESULTS: G6PD/PK ratio able differentiate G6PD- heterozygous individuals normal population. G6PD/PK values also allowed us easily identify G6PD- heterozygous subjects microcytic anaemia. Student's test shows G6PD/PK ratio reliable sample groups, relative G6PD activity normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: G6PD/PK ratio reliable diagnostic parameter mass screening G6PD deficiency.
