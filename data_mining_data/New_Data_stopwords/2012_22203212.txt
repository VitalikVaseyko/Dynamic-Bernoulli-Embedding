 increase oleic acid (C18:1) content desirable trait. Despite critical roles two desaturases, FAD2 FAD3, control fatty acid desaturation, dispute remains whether inactivation genes alone sufficient enough generate high-oleic trait. address question, employed microarray technology investigate difference gene expression profile two different Brassica napus strains high-C18:1 (71.71%) low-C18:1 (55.6%) contents, respectively. study revealed 562 differentially expressed genes, 194 genes up-regulated 368 down-regulated. Based Gene Ontology classification, genes classified 23 functional categories. Three up-regulated genes represent B. napus homologs Arabidopsis genes encoding cytosolic isoform pyruvate kinase (AT3G55810), Delta9 acyl-lipid desaturase (AT1G06080, ADS1) fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B (AT1G08510), respectively. Conversely, homologs two Arabidopsis sequences encoding Delta9 acyl-lipid desaturase (AT2G31360, ADS2) FAD3 desaturase (AT2G29980) down-regulated high-oleic acid strain. Furthermore, 60 differentially expressed genes classified associated relevant Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Collectively, results suggest expressing high-oleic acid trait may require coordinated regulation diverse regulatory metabolic gene networks addition inactivation FAD2 FAD3 genes oilseed. set differentially expressed genes identified study facilitate efforts tap germplasms potential express high-oleic acid trait.
