 human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encoded chemokine receptor US28 promotes tumorigenesis activation various proliferative angiogenic signaling pathways. Upon infection, US28 displays constitutive activity signals G protein-dependent manner, hijacking host's cellular machinery. tumor cells, hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha/pyruvate kinase M2 (HIF-1alpha/PKM2) axis plays important role supporting proliferation, angiogenesis reprogramming energy metabolism. study show US28 signaling results activation HIF-1alpha/PKM2 feedforward loop fibroblasts glioblastoma cells. constitutive activity US28 increases HIF-1 protein stability Galphaq-, CaMKII- Akt/mTOR-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, found VEGF lactate secretion increased HIF-1 target genes, glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), involved glucose metabolism, upregulated US28 expressing cells. addition, PKM2 phosphorylated found tumor-associated dimeric state upon US28 expression. Also HCMV-infected cells HIF-1 activity enhanced, part US28-dependent. Finally, increased proliferation cells expressing US28 abolished upon inhibition HIF-1alpha/PKM2 cascade. data highlight importance HIF-1alpha PKM2 US28-induced proliferation, angiogenesis metabolic reprogramming.
