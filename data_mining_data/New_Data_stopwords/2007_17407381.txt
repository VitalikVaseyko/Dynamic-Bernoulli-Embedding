 Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pivotal regulator diverse metabolic, phenotypic, antiapoptotic cellular controls shown key player cancer progression. Here, using fluorescent reporters, shown cells that, contrary vitro analyses, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) complexed substrate, PKB. use Forster resonance energy transfer detected frequency domain two-photon time domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy lead novel vivo findings. preactivation complex PKB PDK1 maintained inactive state PKB intramolecular interaction pleckstrin homology (PH) kinase domains, "PH-in" conformer. domain-domain interaction prevents PKB activation loop phosphorylated PDK1. interactive regions intramolecular PKB interaction predicted molecular modeling tested mutagenesis, supporting derived model. Physiologically, agonist-induced phosphorylation PKB PDK1 occurs coincident plasma membrane recruitment, shown process associated conformational change PKB membrane, producing "PH-out" conformer enabling PDK1 access activation loop. active, phosphorylated, "PH-out" conformer dissociate membrane retain conformation phosphorylate substrates distal membrane. vivo studies provide new model mechanism activation PKB. study takes crucial widely studied regulator (physiology pathology) addresses fundamental question dynamic vivo behaviour PKB detailed molecular mechanism. important implications extending understanding oncogenic protein kinase also opening distinct opportunities therapeutic intervention.
