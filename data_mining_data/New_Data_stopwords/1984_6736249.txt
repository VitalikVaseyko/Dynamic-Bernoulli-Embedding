 erythrocytes patient so-called "high ATP syndrome" characterized high ATP content low 2,3-diphosphoglycerate level. pyruvate kinase activity specifically increased (about twice normal level). separation erythrocytes according age discontinuous Percoll density centrifugation, pyruvate kinase activity found increased Percoll fractions. Pyruvate kinase patient's cells characterized decreased K0.5 substrate phosphoenolpyruvate inhibition ATP. Michaelis constant (Km) value ADP, nucleotide specificity, thermostability, pH optimum, immunological specific activity normal. concluded high pyruvate kinase activity due shift R(elaxed) equilibrium T(ight) equilibrium R(elaxed) form.
