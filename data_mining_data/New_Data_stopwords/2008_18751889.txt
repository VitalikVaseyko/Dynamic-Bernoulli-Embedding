 Glucose metabolism essential normal brain function plays vital role synaptic transmission. Recent evidence suggests ATP synthesized locally glycolysis, particularly via glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase/3-phosphoglycerate kinase, critical synaptic transmission. present evidence ATP generated synaptic vesicle-associated pyruvate kinase harnessed transport glutamate synaptic vesicles. Isolated synaptic vesicles incorporated [(3)H]glutamate presence phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP. Pyruvate kinase activators inhibitors stimulated reduced PEP/ADP-dependent glutamate uptake, respectively. Membrane potential also formed presence pyruvate kinase activators. "ATP-trapping" experiments using hexokinase glucose suggest ATP produced vesicle-associated pyruvate kinase readily used exogenously added ATP. neurotransmitters GABA, dopamine, serotonin also taken crude synaptic vesicles PEP/ADP-dependent manner. possibility ATP locally generated glycolysis supports vesicular accumulation neurotransmitters discussed.
