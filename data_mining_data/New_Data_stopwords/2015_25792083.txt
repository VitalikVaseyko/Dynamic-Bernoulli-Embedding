 Cancer major threat human health. considerable amount research focused elucidating nature cancer pathogenesis treatment prevention. Tumor cell metabolism considered hallmark cancer. Cancer cells differ normal cells unlimited cell division, show greater need energy rapid growth duplication. Research glycometabolism, key point energy metabolism, played unique role. 1920s, Warburg found cancer cells prefer produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) glycolysis, less efficient pathway compared oxidative phosphorylation. striking discovery, called 'the Warburg effect', influenced guided study mechanism treatment tumors generations, causal relationship cancer progression still unclear. studies shown contradicting evidence new hypothesis, reverse Warburg effect, put forward, cancer cells produce ATP via glycolysis, even aerobic conditions. review discuss new points concerning energy metabolism tumor, well current facts perspectives.
