 AIM: Small molecule activators glucokinase (GKAs) explored extensively potential anti-hyperglycaemic drugs type 2 diabetes (T2D). Several GKAs remarkably effective lowering blood glucose early therapy lost glycaemic efficacy chronically clinical trials. MATERIALS METHODS: used rat hepatocytes test hypothesis GKAs raise hepatocyte glucose 6-phosphate (G6P, glucokinase product) down-stream metabolites consequent repression liver glucokinase gene ( Gck). compared GKA metformin, widely prescribed drug T2D. RESULTS: Treatment hepatocytes 25 mM glucose raised cell G6P, concomitantly Gck repression induction G6pc (glucose 6-phosphatase) Pklr (pyruvate kinase). GKA mimicked high glucose raising G6P fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, regulatory metabolite, causing left-shift glucose responsiveness gene regulation. Fructose, like GKA, repressed Gck modestly induced G6pc. 2-Deoxyglucose, phosphorylated glucokinase metabolized caused Gck repression G6pc induction, implicating glucokinase product Gck repression. Metformin counteracted effect high glucose elevated G6P fructose 2,6-bisphosphate Gck repression, recruitment Mlx-ChREBP G6pc Pklr promoters induction genes. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation hepatocyte G6P downstream metabolites, consequent liver Gck repression, potential contributing mechanism loss GKA efficacy chronic therapy. Cell metformin loads within therapeutic range attenuate effect high glucose G6P glucose-regulated gene expression.
