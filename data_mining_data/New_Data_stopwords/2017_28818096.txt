 BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) aggressive malignancy, high incidence poor prognosis. past several decades, hundreds proteins reported associated prognosis ESCC, none widely accepted guide clinical care. study aimed identify proteins great potential predicting prognosis ESCC. METHODS: conducted systematic review immunohistochemical (IHC) prognostic markers ESCC according 2009 Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines. Literature related IHC prognostic markers ESCC searched PubMed, Embase, Web Science, Cochrane Library January 30th, 2017. risk bias original studies evaluated using Quality Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. RESULTS: identified 11 emerging IHC markers reproducible results, including eight markers [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Survivin, Podoplanin, Fascin, phosphorylated mammalian target rapamycin (p-mTOR), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)] indicating unfavorable prognosis 3 markers (P27, P16, E-cadherin) indicating favorable prognosis ESCC. CONCLUSION: Strong evidence supports 11 emerging IHC markers combinations may useful predicting prognosis aiding personalized therapy decision-making ESCC patients.
