 Inhibition glycolysis Ehrlich ascites tumour cells saturated fatty acids, added either form potassium salts incorporated phosphatidylcholine liposomes, increases increasing carbon atom chain length independent concentration within range 0.1 1.0 mM. contrast, inhibition glycolysis cytosolic fraction Ehrlich ascites cells depends concentration fatty acids. content ATP Ehrlich ascites cells incubated fatty acids increases increasing carbon atom chain length, leads crossing-over concentrations pyruvate 2-phosphoenolpyruvate. Lowering sum metabolites palmitate stearate points inhibition pyruvate kinase also enzymes early steps glycolysis. Fatty acids intact Ehrlich ascites cells inhibit three key glycolytic enzymes added cytosolic fraction affect mainly activity phosphofructokinase. inhibition pyruvate kinase fatty acids smaller cytosolic fraction tumour cells liver muscles.
