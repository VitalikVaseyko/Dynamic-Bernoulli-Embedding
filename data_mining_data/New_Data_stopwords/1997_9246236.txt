 modification pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity foot muscle mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis exposure air recovery water investigated. course exposure air, activity enzymes measured high low substrate concentrations showed successive increases decreases. Returning mussels water exposure air affected enzyme activity manner similar anaerobiosis. measuring saturated concentrations substrates substrate coenzyme PK LDH, respectively, maximum activation PK (37%) observed 4 h animal exposure air, LDH (67%) 6 h exposure air. 24 h exposure animals air, PK activity practically reached stock level, LDH still activated (148%). change lactate dehydrogenase activity mussel muscle anoxia recovery described first time. Variation pyruvate kinase activity exposure air recovery linked alteration half-maximal saturation constants maximal velocity substrates. possible role reversible phosphorylation regulation pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase properties discussed.
