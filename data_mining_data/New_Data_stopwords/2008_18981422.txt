 Ceramide induces cell death response many stimuli. mechanism action, however, completely understood. Ceramide induces autophagy mammalian cells maintained rich media nutrient permease downregulation yeast. observations suggested us ceramide might kill mammalian cells limiting cellular access extracellular nutrients. Consistent proposal, physiologically relevant concentrations ceramide produced profound specific downregulation nutrient transporter proteins mammalian cells. Blocking ceramide-induced nutrient transporter loss supplementation cell-permeable nutrient, methyl pyruvate, reversed ceramide-dependent toxicity. Conversely, cells became sensitive ceramide nutrient stress increased acutely limiting extracellular nutrients, inhibiting autophagy, deleting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Observations ceramide trigger either apoptosis caspase-independent cell death may explained model. found methyl pyruvate (MP) also protected cells ceramide-induced, nonapoptotic death consistent idea severe bioenergetic stress responsible. Taken together, studies suggest cellular metabolic state important arbiter cellular response ceramide. fact, increasing nutrient demand incubating cells high levels growth factor sensitized cells ceramide. hand, gradually adapting cells tolerate low levels extracellular nutrients completely blocked ceramide-induced death. sum, results support model ceramide kills cells inducing intracellular nutrient limitation subsequent nutrient transporter downregulation.
