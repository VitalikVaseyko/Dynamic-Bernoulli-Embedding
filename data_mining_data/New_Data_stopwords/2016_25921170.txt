 BACKGROUND: Diallyl disulfide (DADS) may exert potent anticancer action vitro vivo. Although effects cancer significant, underlying mechanisms remain unknown. study, sought elucidate possible links DADS pyruvate kinase (PKM2). MATERIALS METHODS: KG1alpha, leukemia cell line highly expressing PKM2 used cell counting kit (CCK)-8 flow cytometry (FCM) investigate effects DADS. Relationships PKM2 DADS associated phosphorylation EGFR, ERK1/2 MEK, assessed western blot analysis. RESULTS: KG1alpha cells highly expressing PKM2, found DADS could affect proliferation, apoptosis EGFR/ERK/PKM2 signaling pathways, abrogating EGF-induced nuclear accumulation PKM2. CONCLUSIONS: results suggested DADS suppressed proliferation KG1alpha cells, providing evidence proapoptotic effects mediated inhibition EGFR/ERK/PKM2 signaling pathways.
