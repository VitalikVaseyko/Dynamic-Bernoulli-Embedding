 OBJECTIVE: Linkage type 2 diabetes (T2D) well replicated chromosome 1q21-q23. Within region, T2D associated common single nucleotide polymorphisms marked extended linkage disequilibrium block, including liver pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR), several European-derived populations. study sought determine molecular basis association phenotypic consequences risk haplotype. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: Genes surrounding PKLR resequenced European-American African-American cases controls, association T2D tested. Copy number variants (CNVs) tested four regions real-time PCR. Expression genes region tested adipose muscle nondiabetic subjects genotype. Insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, hepatic glucose production tested nondiabetic individuals haplotype combination. RESULTS: coding variant region associated T2D. CNVs rare associated T2D. PKLR expressed available tissues, expression genes HCN3, CLK2, SCAMP3, FDPS associated haplotype combinations adipose muscle. Haplotype combinations associated insulin secretion peripheral insulin sensitivity, homozygous carriers risk haplotype increased hepatic glucose production hyperinsulinemia. CONCLUSIONS: Noncoding variants PKLR region likely alter gene expression one genes. extensive physiological molecular studies suggest increased hepatic glucose production reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity, thus pointing PKLR likely candidate gene population.
