 Soluble enzymes immobilized visualized polyacrylamide gel slabs, impregnated incubation medium including auxiliary enzymes. method several advantages existing techniques make use gel films semipermeable membrane. diffusion tissue compounds effectively limited, auxiliary enzymes may operative. Moreover viscosity medium temperature-independent incubation temperature varied. demonstrate suitability method glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, phosphoglucomutase aldolase visulaized human rat skeletal muscle. Cytosolic mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase visualized absence added NAD+ menadione. visualization ATP producint enzymes, like creatine kinase pyruvate kinase, method suitable.
