 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) key regulator cell proliferation survival signal transduction. PDK1 known constitutively active activated Src-mediated phosphorylation tyrosine-9, -373, -376 residues. identify novel regulators PDK1, performed E. coli-based two-hybrid screening revealed tumor suppressor candidate 4 (TUSC4), also known nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2), formed complex PDK1 suppressed Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation activation PDK1 vitro cells. NH(2)-terminal 133 amino acid residues TUSC4 involved binding PDK1. deletion mutant TUSC4 lacked NH(2)-terminal domain showed inhibitory effects PDK1 tyrosine phosphorylation activation. Thus, complex formation indispensable TUSC4-mediated PDK1 inactivation. siRNA-mediated down-regulation TUSC4 induced cell proliferation, ectopic TUSC4 expression inactivated PDK1 downstream signaling pathway, including Akt p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase, increased cancer cell sensitivity several anticancer drugs. results suggest TUSC4/NPRL2, novel PDK1-interacting protein, plays role regulating Src/PDK1 signaling pathway cell sensitivity multiple cancer chemotherapeutic drugs.
