 kinetic optical properties pyruvate kinase isolated rabbit muscle, sturgeon muscle, yeast compared using various activating divalent metal ions probes functional features using ultraviolet circular dichroism (cd) measurements conformational features, respectively. three preparations pyruvate kinase similar many aspects, activating efficiencies four activating metal ions, Mg(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Ni(II) pH-rate profiles, suggesting presence similar metal binding locus enzymes well common underlying mechanism action. L-Phe inhibited rabbit muscle enzyme turned hyperbolic kinetics sigmoidal kinetic respect phosphoenolpyruvate alkaline pH, fructose-1,6-biphosphate activated sturgeon muscle yeast enzymes turned sigmoidal kinetics hyperbolic kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate. ultraviolet cd spectral changes qualitatively correlated well kinetic observations three native enzymes presence absence allosteric effectors. results suggested least two conformational states pyruvate kinase inducible binding substrate (or) allosteric effectors. conformational changes one form another enzymes similar, especially rabbit sturgeon muscle enzymes.
