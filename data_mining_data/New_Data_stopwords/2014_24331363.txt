 Mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction gliomas linked abnormalities mt energy metabolism, marked metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis ("Warburg effect"), disturbances mt membrane potential regulation apoptotic signaling, well somatic mutations involving Krebs cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. Evolving biological concepts potential therapeutic implications include interaction microtubule proteins mitochondria (mt) control closure voltage-dependent anion channels regulation mt dynamics mt-endoplasmic reticulum network. cytoskeletal protein betaIII-tubulin, overexpressed malignant gliomas, emerged prosurvival factor associated part mt also marker chemoresistance. Mt-targeted therapeutic strategies discussed include following: (1) metabolic modulation emphasis dichloroacetate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor; (2) tumor cell death via apoptosis induced tricyclic antidepressants, microtubule-modulating drugs, small molecules compounds capable inflicting reactive oxygen species-dependent tumor cell death; (3) pretreatment mt priming mt-targeted prodrug cancer therapy.
