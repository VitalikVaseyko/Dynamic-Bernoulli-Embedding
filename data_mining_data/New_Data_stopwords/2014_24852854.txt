 BACKGROUND: Screening colorectal cancer (CRC) requires non-invasive methods high diagnostic sensitivity specificity. evaluated measurement genetic protein biomarkers CRC stool samples aim testing clinical utility CRC screening program. PATIENTS METHODS: Individuals aged 53-75 years risk CRC immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) positive invited submit stool samples molecular testing prior colonoscopy. KRAS codon 12 Gly-->Asp, Gly, Val, codon 13 Gly-->Cys gene mutations tested using in-house real-time ARMS PCR method. M2PK levels stool samples measured utilizing commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: colonoscopy, 7.6% patients found CRC, 50% adenomas, 10.6% hyperplastic polyps, 20.2% diverticulosis hemorrhoids, 11.6% normal mucosa. best sensitivity CRC (50%) found cases M2PK KRAS abnormalities coexisted. M2PK showed detection rate 40.3% adenomas combination M2PK KRAS abnormalities found 5.7% adenomas (P <0.01). iFOBT false positive 31.8% cases colonoscopy excluded neoplastic lesions, coexistence molecular enzymatic abnormalities specific false positive rates 8.3% 9.0% (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: molecular screening approach demonstrates detection cancer-associated biomarkers measured iFOBT-positive stool samples could help separate true false positives FOBT-based screening process. M2PK showed particular promise detection CRC adenomas.
