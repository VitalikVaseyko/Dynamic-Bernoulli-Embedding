 metabolism tumor cells (tumor metabolome) characterized high concentration glycolytic enzymes including pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK), high glutaminolytic capacity, high fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) levels low (ATP+GTP):(CTP+UTP) ratio. sequence events required establishment tumor metabolome presently unknown. non-transformed rat kidney (NRK) cells observed high glutaminolytic flux rate low (ATP+GTP):(CTP+UTP) ratio, whereas FBP levels M2-PK activity still extremely low. stable expression oncogenic ras NRK cells strong upregulation FBP levels M2-PK activity observed. Elevated FBP levels induce tetramerization M2-PK migration glycolytic enzyme complex. AMP levels increase whereas UTP CTP levels strongly decrease. Thus, ras expression completes glycolytic part tumor metabolism leading inhibition nucleic acid synthesis cell proliferation. HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, cooperates ras cell transformation, directly binds M2-PK, induces dimerization restores nucleic acid synthesis well cell proliferation. Apparently, combination different metabolic effects ras E7 constructs perfect tumor metabolome generally found tumor cells.
