 Growing alarming rate Western world, obesity become condition associated multitude diseases diabetes, metabolic syndrome various cancers. Generally viewed abnormal accumulation hypertrophied adipocytes, obesity also poor prognostic factor recurrence chemoresistance cancer patients. two-thirds adult population United States considered clinically overweight obese, critical relationship obesity cancer emphasized elucidated. Adipocytes highly metabolically active cells, which, release adipokines cytokines activation endocrine paracrine pathways, affect processes neighboring distant cells, altering normal homeostasis. work examine specifically adipocyte-derived factors regulate cellular metabolism malignant cells within tumor niche. Briefly, tumor cells undergo metabolic pressure towards glycolytic hypoxic state variety metabolic regulators signaling pathways, i.e., phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), c-MYC signaling. Enhanced glycolysis high lactate production hallmarks tumor progression largely process known Warburg effect. Herein, review latest literature pertaining body work interactions adipose tumor cells, underlining changes cancer cell metabolism targeted currently available treatments.
