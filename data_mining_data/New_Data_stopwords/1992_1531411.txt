 effects calcium antagonists nimodipine, nicardipine flunarizine lactate production specific activities enzymes regulating glycolytic flux evaluated synaptosomes isolated rat whole brain submitted vitro chemical hypoxia induced rotenone, inhibitor mitochondrial respiration. following enzymes tested; hexokinase (ATP: D-hexose-6-phosphotransferase, EC2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (ATP: D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40). results show rotenone increases eight times production lactate; nicardipine nimodipine, starting concentration 10(-4) M, able counteract rotenone-induced stimulation glycolysis, flunarizine without effect. dihydropyridines flunarizine decreased maximum activity phosphofructokinase. effect already detectable concentration 10(-5) M. Neither hexokinase pyruvate kinase affected drugs studied.
