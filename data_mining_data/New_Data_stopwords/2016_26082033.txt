 UNLABELLED: Hormones corresponding receptors vital controlling metabolism normal physiologic pathologic conditions, less known roles metabolism cancer. Using small interfering RNA screening approach, examined effects silencing 20 well-known hormone receptors Warburg effect, specifically measuring production lactate four established hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. found silencing variety hormone receptors effects production metabolite. Unexpectedly silencing mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) significantly increased lactate production HCC cell lines. Subsequent vitro vivo studies showed gain- loss-of-function MR significantly influenced HCC cellular proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed MR transcriptional factor directly regulated expression miR-338-3p, suppressing Warburg effects HCC cells targeting key enzyme glycolysis: pyruvate kinase, liver red blood cells. Moreover, MR expression significantly down-regulated 81% HCC patient tissues, caused chromosome deletion histone deacetylation. Low expression MR tumor tissues associated poor patient prognosis. expression level miR-338-3p found positively correlate expression MR HCC tissues inversely correlate expression enzyme pyruvate kinase, liver red blood cells. CONCLUSION: MR affects HCC development modulating miR-338-3p/pyruvate kinase, liver red blood cells axis ability suppress Warburg effect.
