 Seven subjects fed 3,000 kcal defined formula diet daily 19 days. Except one 5-day period, 50% total caloric intake provided either oral intravenous glucose. study divided four periods follows: period lasted 5 days provided 50% calories glucose; period II lasted 5 days provided carbohydrate (70% fat 30% protein); period III lasted 4 days provided 50% calories intravenous glucose 50% calories oral fat plus protein; period IV lasted 5 days provided 50% calories oral glucose. Intestinal biopsy specimens taken days 3 5 period, except period III biopsies done day 4. change intestinal morphology occurred study. carbohydrate-free diet caused alpha-glucosidase (maltase sucrase) activities decrease significantly seen glucose diet. Sucrase decreased 14.4 +/- 1.0 7.1 +/- 0.9 mumoles/min per g tissue maltase decreased 56.1 +/- 3.4 30.0 +/- 2.1 mumoles/min per g tissue. Glycolytic enzyme activities decreased carbohydrate-free period (pyruvate kinase decreased 236 +/- 12 78 +/- 8, fructose 1-phosphate aldolase decreased 147 +/- 6 53 +/- 4, fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase decreased 151 +/- 8 55 +/- 3, hexokinase decreased 21 +/- 3 7 +/- 1 nmoles/min per mg protein, respectively). Intravenous glucose caused change disaccharidase activities. enzyme activities periods IV identical significantly higher period II exception fructose-1,6-diphosphatase increased period II compared periods IV. findings provide explanation transient period decreased tolerance dietary sugars patients weaned total parenteral feedings enteral feedings.
