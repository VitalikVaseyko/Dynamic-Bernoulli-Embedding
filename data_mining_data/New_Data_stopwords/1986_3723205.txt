 evaluate published indications 25% gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), located mitochondria adult rat liver, cell fractionations conducted hepatocytes isolated rats fed ad libitum starved 2 days. Hepatocytes exposed digitonin 10 s, released materials separated residual cell structures centrifugation layer brominated hydrocarbon. addition PEPCK, activities 9 enzymes measured untreated cells good recovery two fractions obtained digitonin treatment. comparison release marker enzymes cytosol mitochondria, subcellular distribution PEPCK determined. cells either fed 2-day-starved rats, enzyme released exactly like lactate dehydrogenase within 2-3% phosphoglycerate kinase pyruvate kinase. results indicate that, even induction starvation, least 97% PEPCK activity located cytosol rat liver.
