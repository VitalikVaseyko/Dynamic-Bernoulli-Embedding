 basis enzyme activities detected extracts Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 grown glucose-limited continuous culture, slow (0.11 h-1) fast (0.52 h-1) dilution rate, pathway glucose catabolism lactate, acetate, succinate, propionate constructed. Glucose catabolized phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) via Emden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. PEP converted either pyruvate (via pyruvate kinase) oxalacetate (via PEP carboxykinase). Pyruvate reduced L-lactate via NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase oxidatively decarboxylated acetyl coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) CO2 pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Acetyl-CoA apparently converted single enzymatic step acetate CoA, concomitant formation 1 molecule ATP; since acetyl-phosphate intermediate, enzyme catalyzing reaction identified acetate thiokinase. Oxalacetate converted succinate via activities malate dehydrogenase, fumarase membrane-bound fumarate reductase. Succinate excreted decarboxylated propionate via membrane-bound methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Pyruvate kinase inhibited Pi activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. PEP carboxykinase activity found 0.054 mumol min-1 mg protein-1 dilution rate 0.11 h-1 could detected extracts cells grown dilution rate 0.52 h-1. Several potential sites energy conservation exist S. ruminantium HD4, including pyruvate kinase, acetate thiokinase, PEP carboxykinase, fumarate reductase, methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Possession five sites energy conservation may explain high yields reported (56 78 mg cells [dry weight] mol glucose-1) S. ruminantium HD4 grown glucose-limited continuous culture.
