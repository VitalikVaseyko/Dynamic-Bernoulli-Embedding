 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase isozymes human breast tumor tissue compared study normal human breast tissue. Two forms pyruvate kinase present normal tumor human breast purified ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, gel filtration, ion exchange, affinity chromatography. Molecular weight native enzyme determined. METHODS: Presence pyruvate kinase activity examined normal tumor breast tissues. Pyruvate kinase purified Sephadex DEAE-50, Sepharyl S-200, Blue Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. Spectrophotometric methods used determine activities pyruvate kinase. RESULTS: Molecular weights fractions II determined gel filtration Sepharyl S-200 135,000 Da, 260,000 Da normal breast tissue, 72,000 Da, 250,000 Da tumor breast tissue, respectively. Fractions II pyruvate kinase may purified approximately 1,591-fold, 636.4-fold normal breast tissue 219-fold, 318-fold tumor breast tissue, respectively. Pyruvate kinase activity tumor tissue found higher normal tissue. tumor fraction II showed tumor-specific sensitivity L-cysteine. L-phenylalanine inhibited fractions II normal breast fraction tumor breast, fraction II pyruvate tumor. ATP inhibited normal tumor fraction pyruvate kinase. influence ATP enzyme activity normal tumor fraction II depended upon concentration. CONCLUSIONS: thought isozymes pyruvate kinase human breast tissue might M1 M2 isozymes compared tissue pyruvate kinase isoenzymes. Fraction II breast tumor represented different sensitivity L-cysteine, L-phenylalanine, specific activity comparison fraction II normal breast. Different kinetic behavior fractions human breast tumors may support concept isozyme shift.
