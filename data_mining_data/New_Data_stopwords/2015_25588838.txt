 Non-amoeboid cell migration characterised dynamic competition among multiple protrusions establish new adhesion sites cell's leading edge. However, mechanisms regulate decision disassemble grow nascent adhesions fully understood. show that, endothelial cells, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) promotes focal adhesion (FA) turnover controlling endocytosis integrin alphavbeta3 PI3K-dependent manner. demonstrate PDK1 binds phosphorylates integrin alphavbeta3. Downregulation PDK1 increases FA size slows disassembly. process requires PDK1 kinase activity PI3K activation involve Akt. Moreover, PDK1 silencing stabilises FA membrane protrusions decreasing migration endothelial cells vitronectin. results indicate modulation integrin endocytosis PDK1 hampers endothelial cell adhesion migration extracellular matrix, thus unveiling novel role kinase.
