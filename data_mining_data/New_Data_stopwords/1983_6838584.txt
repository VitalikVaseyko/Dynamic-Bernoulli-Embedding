 Succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylated incubation mitochondria brain, heart, liver [gamma-32P]ATP. Dichloroacetate, known specific inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, inhibits phosphate incorporation alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase also autophosphorylation succinyl-CoA synthetase. AMP also inhibits phosphorylation proteins. Phosphorylation alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase liver mitochondria significantly lower mitochondria tissues.
