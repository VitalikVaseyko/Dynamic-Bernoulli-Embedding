 Thymidine analogs, including 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-deoxythymidine (D4T), important antiretroviral agents. exert antiretroviral activity, analogs undergo stepwise phosphorylation intracellularly active triphosphate metabolites. previously reported 4'-substituted D4T ethynyl group (i.e., 4'-ethynyl D4T) increased anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity active multidrug-resistant HIV strains. 4'-Ethynyl D4T better substrate phosphorylation human thymidine kinase 1 D4T is. report, first studied enzymes involved phosphorylation 4'-ethynyl D4T monophosphate triphosphate metabolites. 4'-ethynyl D4TMP phosphorylated recombinant human TMP kinase K(m) 19 +/- 4 microM k(cat) 0.007 +/- 0.001 s(-1); relative efficiency 9 15% D4TMP AZTMP, respectively. Several enzymes crude cellular extracts, including nucleoside diphosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, could phosphorylate 4'-ethynyl D4T-diphosphate. relative phosphorylation efficiencies 4'-ethynyl D4TDP 3 25% D4TDP generally similar AZTDP. T-lymphoid cell lines, preponderant accumulation 4'-ethynyl D4TMP, suggesting TMP kinase could rate-limiting enzyme metabolism 4'-ethynyl D4T. Although enzymes involved stepwise phosphorylation thymidine analogs, behaviors phosphorylating metabolites 4'-ethynyl D4T different D4T AZT. Qualitatively, metabolism 4'-ethynyl D4T similar AZT progenitor, D4T.
