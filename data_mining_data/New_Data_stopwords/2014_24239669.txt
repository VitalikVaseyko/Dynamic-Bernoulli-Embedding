 elucidate short-term time-course liver metabolic response rainbow trout acute handling stress subjected rainbow trout 5min chasing obtained samples 0 480min post-stress. Levels cortisol, glucose lactate measured plasma, whereas metabolite levels, enzyme activities, mRNA abundance parameters related energy metabolism, glucocorticoid receptors assessed liver. Acute stress affected many parameters related energy metabolism, turning back normal levels 480min. general, present results support existence two stages short-term time-course metabolic response handling stress. first stage occurring minutes post-stress (15-45min), characterized increased mobilization liver glycogen resulting increased production endogenous glucose, reduced use exogenous glucose reduced lipogenic potential. second stage, occurring 60-120min post-stress onwards characterized recovery liver glycogen levels, increased capacity liver releasing glucose, recovery lipogenic capacity whereas changes noted gluconeogenic potential, probably needs longer time periods become enhanced.
