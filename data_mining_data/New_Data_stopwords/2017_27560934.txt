 Salt stress important abiotic stressor affecting crop growth productivity. 20 percent terrestrial earth's surface available agricultural land, 50 percent estimated United Nations Environment Program salinized level crops growing salt-stressed. Increased soil salinity profound effects seed germination germinating seedlings frequently confronted much higher salinities vigorously growing plants, germination usually occurs surface soils, site greatest soluble salt accumulation. growth soybean exposed 40 mM NaCl negatively affected, exposure 80 mM NaCl often lethal. treated bacterial signal compounds lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) thuricin 17 (Th17), soybean seeds (variety Absolute RR) responded positively salt stress 150 mM NaCl. Shotgun proteomics unstressed 100 mM NaCl stressed seeds (48 h) combination LCO Th17 revealed many known, predicted, hypothetical unknown proteins. all, carbon, nitrogen energy metabolic pathways affected unstressed salt stressed conditions treated signals. PEP carboxylase, Rubisco oxygenase large subunit, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate lyase noteworthy proteins enhanced signals, along antioxidant glutathione-S-transferase stress related proteins. findings suggest germinating seeds alter proteome based bacterial signals stress, specificity response plays crucial role organ maturation transition one stage another plants' life cycle; understanding response fundamental importance agriculture and, result, global food security. mass spectrometry proteomics data deposited ProteomeXchange identifier PXD004106.
