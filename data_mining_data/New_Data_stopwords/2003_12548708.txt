 cDNA microarrays two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis combination mass spectrometry, used screen alterations mRNA protein levels, respectively, cerebral cortex MK-801-treated rats. rats divided two groups; group 1 (short-term treated) group 2 (long-term treated). group 1, four genes up-regulated five down-regulated. group 2, seven genes up-regulated six down-regulated. group 1, levels one protein increased eight proteins reduced. group 2, levels two proteins increased four proteins reduced. Several altered genes (casein kinase 2, glutamic acid decarboxylase, synaptotagmin, gamma aminobutyric acid [GABA] transporter, creatine kinase, cytochrome c oxidase) proteins (superoxide dismutase, hsp 60, hsp 72 gamma-enolase) previously connected schizophrenia. Alterations genes (microglobulin, c-jun proto-oncogene, 40S ribosomal protein S19, adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation factors, platelet-derived growth factor, fructose-bisphophate aldolase A, myelin proteolipid) proteins (stathmin, H+-transp. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, beta-actin alpha-enolase), not, knowledge, earlier implicated schizophrenia pathology. Overall, results combined approach genomics proteomics add validity subchronic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist treatment animal model schizophrenia.
