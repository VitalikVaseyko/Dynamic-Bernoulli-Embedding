 aim present study analyse effects partial total replacement fish meal (FM) fish oil (FO) mixture plant protein (PP) mixture vegetable oils (VO) hepatic insulin-nutrient-signalling pathway intermediary metabolism-related gene expression rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Triplicate groups fish fed four practical diets containing graded levels replacement FM FO PP VO 12 weeks: diet 0/0 (100 % FM, 100 % FO); diet 50/50 (50 % FM 50 % PP, 50 % FO 50 % VO); diet 50/100 (50 % FM 50 % PP, 100 % VO); diet 100/100 (100 % PP, 100 % VO). Samplings performed trout starved 5 refed allocated diet. contrast partial substitution (diet 50/50), total substitution FM FO (diet 100/100) led significantly lower growth compared diet 0/0. insulin-nutrient-signalling pathway (protein kinase B (Akt), target rapamycin (TOR), S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1) S6) characterised trout liver found activated refeeding. However, changes diet compositions differentially affect Akt-TOR-signalling pathway. Moreover, expression genes encoding fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 affected refeeding dietary changes. Refeeding down- up-regulated expression gluconeogenic glucose-6-phosphatase isoform 1 lipogenic fatty acid synthase genes, respectively. Expression genes also increased partial replacement FM total replacement FO (diet 50/100). findings indicate plant-based diets barely affect glucose lipid metabolism trout.
