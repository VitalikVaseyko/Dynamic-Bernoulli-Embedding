 Active glycolysis glutaminolysis provide bioenergetic stability cancer cells physiological conditions. hypoxia, metabolic mitochondrial disorders, pharmacological treatment, deficit key metabolic substrates may become life-threatening cancer cells. analysed effects mitochondrial uncoupling FCCP respiration cells fed different combinations Glc, Gal, Gln Pyr. cancer PC12 HCT116 cells, large increase O2 consumption rate (OCR) upon uncoupling seen Gln combined either Glc Pyr. Inhibition glutaminolysis BPTES abolished effect. Despite key role Gln, addition FCCP inhibited respiration induced apoptosis cells supplied Gln alone Gal/Gln. substrate combinations, amplitude respiratory responses FCCP correlate Akt, Erk AMPK phosphorylation, cellular ATP, resting OCR, mitochondrial Ca(2+) membrane potential. However, propose proton motive force could modulate respiratory response FCCP regulating mitochondrial transport Gln Pyr, decreases upon mitochondrial depolarisation. result, increase respiration upon uncoupling abolished cells, deprived Gln Pyr (Glc). Unlike PC12 HCT116 cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts capable generating pronounced response FCCP deprived Gln, thus exhibiting lower dependence glutaminolysis. Overall, differential regulation respiratory response FCCP metabolic environment suggests mitochondrial uncoupling potential substrate-specific inhibition cell function, explored selective cancer treatment.
