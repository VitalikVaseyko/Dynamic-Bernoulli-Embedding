 Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate potent allosteric activator trypanosomatid pyruvate kinase thus represents important regulator energy metabolism protozoan parasites. 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, responsible synthesis regulator, highly purified bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei kinetically characterized. searching trypanosomatid genome databases, four genes encoding proteins homologous mammalian bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) found T. brucei related parasite Leishmania major four pairs Trypanosoma cruzi. genes predicted encode protein which, most, single domain would active. Two T. brucei proteins showed conservation PFK-2 domain, although one predicted inactive due substitution residues responsible ligating catalytically essential divalent metal cation; two proteins conserved FBPase-2 domain. two PFK-2-like proteins expressed Escherichia coli. Indeed, first displayed PFK-2 activity similar kinetic properties enzyme purified T. brucei, whereas activity found second. Interestingly, several predicted trypanosomatid PFK-2/FBPase-2 proteins long N-terminal extensions. N-terminal domains two polypeptides similarity mammalian PFK-2s contain series tandem repeat ankyrin motifs. proteins motifs known mediate protein-protein interactions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests four different PFK-2/FBPase-2 isoenzymes found Trypanosoma Leishmania evolved single ancestral bifunctional enzyme within trypanosomatid lineage. possible explanation evolution multiple monofunctional enzymes presence ankyrin-motif repeats PFK-2 isoenzymes presented.
