 epidermal growth factor (EGF) activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt cascade among signaling pathways. route involved cell proliferation survival, therefore, dysregulation promote cancer. Considering relevance PI3K-Akt signaling cell survival pathogenesis cancer, GH reported modulate EGFR expression signaling, objective study analyze effects increased GH levels EGF-induced PI3K-Akt signaling. EGF-induced signaling evaluated liver GH-overexpressing transgenic mice normal siblings. Akt expression increased GH-overexpressing mice, EGF-induced phosphorylation Akt, relative protein content, diminished Ser473 inhibited Thr308; consequently, mTOR, substrate Akt, activated EGF. However, activation PDK1, kinase involved Akt phosphorylation Thr308, reduced transgenic mice. Kinetics studies EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation showed rapidly transiently induced GH-overexpressing mice compared normal siblings. Thus, expression activity phosphatases involved termination PI3K-Akt signaling studied. transgenic mice, neither PTEN PP2A hyperactivated; however, EGF induced rapid transient association SHP-2 Gab1, mediates association EGFR activation PI3K. Rapid recruitment SHP2, would accelerate termination proliferative signal induced, could therefore contributing diminished EGF-induced activity Akt GH-overexpressing mice.
