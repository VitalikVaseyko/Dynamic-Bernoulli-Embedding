 series substrate analogues used determine chemical moieties substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) contribute allosteric inhibition rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase phenylalanine. Replacing carboxyl group substrate methyl alcohol removing phosphate altogether greatly reduces substrate affinity. However, removal carboxyl group modification tested removes ability allosterically reduce level Phe binding. this, concluded carboxyl group PEP responsible energetic coupling Phe binding allosteric sites.
