 Starting (+)-epi- (-)-vibo-quercitols readily produced bioconversion myo-inositol, biologically interesting phosphate polyphosphate analogues, including Ins(1,4,5)P(3) derivatives 3-deoxy- 6-deoxy-D-myo-inositol, could readily prepared conventional manner. addition, chemical modification C-2 3-deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P(3) provided 2-epimer, 2-deoxy 2-deoxy-2-fluoro forms. Eight polyphosphate analogues obtained assayed biological activity PDH-Pase PDH-K, G6Pase, none proved positive.
