 Cell-intrinsic metabolic reprogramming hallmark cancer provides anabolic support cell proliferation. reprogramming influences tumor heterogeneity drug sensitivities well understood. Here, report self-organizing spatial pattern glycolysis xenograft colon tumors pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1), negative regulator oxidative phosphorylation, highly active clusters cells arranged spotted array. understand pattern, developed reaction-diffusion model incorporates Wnt signaling, pathway known upregulate PDK1 Warburg metabolism. Partial interference Wnt alters size intensity spotted pattern tumors model. model predicts Wnt inhibition trigger increase proteins enhance range Wnt ligand diffusion. prediction validated xenograft tumors similar patterns also emerge radiochemotherapy-treated colorectal cancer. model also predicts inhibitors target glycolysis Wnt signaling combination synergize effective treatment individually. validated prediction 3D colon tumor spheroids.
