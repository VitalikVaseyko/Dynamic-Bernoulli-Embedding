 pattern gene expression fetal hepatocytes transformed culture hepatocarcinogen (FRL cells) studied respect range markers either developmentally regulated and/or shown expressed high levels hepatoma cells. relative abundance respective mRNAs determined immunocytochemistry used detect respective proteins cultured cells. compared normal counterpart, FRL cells retain expression transferrin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, tyrosine aminotransferase near normal levels, expression liver-specific isoenzymes pyruvate kinase (L form) aldolase (B form) reduced. cell lines different fail express albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, thiostatin alpha 2-macroglobulin, express high levels M2-pyruvate kinase aldolase A, markers often found abundance hepatoma cells. Therefore transformation resulted different effects different genes. Furthermore, interest find cells coexpress forms pyruvate kinase isoenzymes occur normal developing hepatocyte. results indicate possible use model study changes accompany transformation fetal rat hepatocytes. resulting cell lines stable phenotype retain changes result transformation even extended passaging. facilitates comparisons precursor cell tumor cell, maintained controlled conditions exist culture.
