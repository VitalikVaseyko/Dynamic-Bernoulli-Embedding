 problem whether mitochondria participate contraction relaxation heart binding Ca2+ reversibly discussed actively recent times. role mitochondria yet conclusively established, suggested several lines evidence, particularly amphibian hearts. Apart contraction relaxation, Ca2+ transport system mitochondria may influence many Ca2+-sensitive cell reactions. mitochondrial (succinate oxidase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase) may control operations respiratory chain trichloroacetic acid cycle. Among extramitochondrial Ca2+-sensitive reactions phosphorylase b kinase, phospholipases, pyruvate kinase. latter activity studied detail, indeed found modulated mitochondria. appears possible mitochondrial system binding transporting Ca2+ efficient means regulate various phases cell metabolism.
