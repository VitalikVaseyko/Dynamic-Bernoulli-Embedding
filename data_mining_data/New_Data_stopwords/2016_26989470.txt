 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) one prevalent cancers third leading cause cancer-related deaths worldwide. patients unresectable disease, loco-regional catheter-based intra-arterial therapies (IAT) achieve selective tumor control minimizing systemic toxicity. molecular features tumor growth microenvironment better understood, new targets arise selective anticancer therapy. Particularly, antiglycolytic drugs exploit hyperglycolytic cancer cell metabolism - also known 'Warburg effect' - emerged promising therapeutic options. Thus, future developments combine selective character loco-regional drug delivery platforms highly specific molecular targeted antiglycolytic agents. review exemplify literature antiglycolytic approaches particularly focus intra-arterial delivery methods.
