 showed rat Na(+)/P(i) cotransporter-1 (RNaPi-1) gene regulated insulin glucose rat hepatocytes. aim work elucidate signaling pathways insulin-mediated metabolic regulation RNaPi-1 gene H4IIE cells. Insulin increased RNaPi-1 mRNA abundance presence glucose decreased RNaPi-1 mRNA absence glucose, clearly establishing involvement metabolic signals insulin-induced upregulation RNaPi-1 gene. Pyruvate insulin increased RNaPi-1 expression downregulated L-pyruvate kinase, indicating existence gene-specific metabolic signals. Although fructose, glycerol, lactate could support insulin-induced upregulation RNaPi-1 gene, compounds entering metabolism beyond pyruvate oxidation, acetate citrate, could not, suggesting RNaPi-1-specific metabolic signals generated pyruvate oxidation. Wortmannin, LY-294002, rapamycin abolished insulin effect RNaPi-1 gene, whereas expression dominant negative Asn(17) Ras mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD-98059 exhibited effect. Thus herein propose metabolic regulation RNaPi-1 expression insulin mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/p70 ribosomal S6 kinase pathways, Ras/MAPK pathway.
