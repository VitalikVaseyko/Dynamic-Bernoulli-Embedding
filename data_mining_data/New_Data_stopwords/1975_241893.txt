 Pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40), extracted mycelium Neurospora crassa purified 560-fold precipitation ammonium sulphate, chromatography DEAE-Sephadex, gel filtration Sephadex G-200. Potassium magnesium required enzyme activity. Fructose, 1,6-diphosphate physiological activator found enzyme. decreasing order potency, citrate, oxalacetate, calcium, ATP inhibitors. Phosphoenolpyruvate cooperatively bound enzyme cooperatively reduced ATP completely eliminated fructose-1,6-diphosphate. Lowering pH 7-5 5-5 changes Hill coefficient 2-7 1-0. Substitution ADP nucleotides reduces enzyme activity. Manganese substitute cofactor magnesium, reaction velocity reduced. MgADP- cooperatively bound enzyme inhibition enzyme occurs either magnesium ADP excess beyond optimum concentration. kinetics properties pyruvate kinase compatible role regulator glycolysis Neurospora crassa.
