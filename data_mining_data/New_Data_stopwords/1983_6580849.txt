 Spontaneous mutants defective membrane component phosphoenolpyruvate-glucose phosphotransferase system isolated plating cells Streptococcus sanguis 10556, Streptococcus mutans GS5-2 NCTC 10449 agar containing lactose 2-deoxyglucose. Toluenized cells mutants defective ability catalyse phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation 2-deoxyglucose. parental strains mainly homofermentative grown batch culture presence various sugars. Nevertheless, mutants produced acetate, formate ethanol cultured presence glucose homofermentative grown presence lactose maltose. Analysis one mutant isolated Strep. sanguis (mutant GS26) revealed normal levels glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, puruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. last enzyme dependent fructose 1,6-diphosphate catalytic activity. determination intracellular level fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) growth cells batch culture showed mutant strains contained 2 15 times less FDP parental strains. Growth experiments performed pH 6.0 7.0 Strep. sanguis PTS-negative mutant GS26 suggested regulation pyruvate metabolism bacterium include intracellular level FDP initial hydrogen concentration growth medium. results also suggested that, bacteria, active PTS required maintain intracellular concentration FDP high enough keep cell homofermentative growth batch culture.
