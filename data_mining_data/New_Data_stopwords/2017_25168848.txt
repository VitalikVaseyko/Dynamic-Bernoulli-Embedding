 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) emerging promising non-invasive treatment cancers. involves three key components; photosensitizer, light tissue oxygen. Even though several photosensitizers investigated use PDT, several disadvantages hence search effective sensitizers become important recent years. dye selected study - symmetrical diiodinated benzothiazolium squaraine (SQDI) - one newly developed photosensitizers. study aimed evaluate vitro cytotoxicity dye Ehrlich's Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells assess vivo toxicity Swiss Albino mice. EAC cells maintained peritoneum mice used study dark toxicity phototoxicity Trypan blue dye exclusion method, estimation Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), caspase activity levels thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). vitro studies revealed dye induces toxicity presence light mediates cell death. vivo part study, dealt toxicity evaluation body Swiss Albino mice, done analyzing parameters like serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) alkaline phosphatase (ALP). significant change observed mentioned parameters dye administered group compared control. Altogether, experiment indicates SQDI selected study may used efficient photosensitizer PDT applications elicit acute toxicity normal tissues absence light.
