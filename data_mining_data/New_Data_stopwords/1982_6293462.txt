 endogenous respiration rumen ciliate Dasytricha ruminantium maintained O2 tension 2kPa (approximately 0.02 atm) partially inhibited KCN (40% inhibition) NaN3 (58% inhibition). organisms lack cytochromes, sensitivity respiration KCN, NaN3, chloroquine quercetin suggest operation flavoprotein-iron-sulphur-mediated electron transport. Tritrichomonas foetus, hydrogenosomal respiration stimulated addition CoA presence 0.025% Triton X-100; stimulation ADP detected. Stimulation pyruvate-supported O2 uptake Pi suggests acetate produced via acetyl phosphate.
