 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency autosomal, recessive, inherited disease Basenjis causes chronic, regenerative, hemolytic anemia. Diagnostic methods currently used identify carrier animals rely measurement erythrocyte PK activity frequently give equivocal results. genetic test incorporating polymerase chain reaction amplification genomic DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism developed determine PK genotype Basenjis. determine whether results genetic test compared results standard tests PK deficiency, erythrocyte PK activity, hematocrit, reticulocyte counts determined in, genetic test performed on, 24 dogs. genetic test accurately identified 11 dogs whose PK genotype known prior study, results consistent results measuring erythrocyte PK activity remaining 13 dogs. genetic test may value determining PK genotype Basenjis.
