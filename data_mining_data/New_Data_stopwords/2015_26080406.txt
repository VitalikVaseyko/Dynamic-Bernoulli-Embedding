 Streptococcus pneumoniae leading cause pneumonia one common causes death globally. impact S. pneumoniae host molecular processes lead detrimental pulmonary consequences fully understood. Here, show S. pneumoniae induces toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) human alveolar epithelial cells, indicated ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM)-dependent phosphorylation histone H2AX colocalization p53-binding protein (53BP1). Furthermore, results show DNA damage occurs bacterial contact-independent fashion Streptococcus pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), enables synthesis H2O2, plays critical role inducing DSBs. extent DNA damage correlates extent apoptosis, DNA damage precedes apoptosis, consistent time required execution apoptosis. Furthermore, addition catalase, neutralizes H2O2, greatly suppresses S. pneumoniae-induced DNA damage apoptosis. Importantly, S. pneumoniae induces DSBs lungs animals acute pneumonia, H2O2 production S. pneumoniae vivo contributes genotoxicity virulence. One major DSBs repair pathways nonhomologous end joining Ku70/80 essential repair. find deficiency Ku80 causes increase levels DSBs apoptosis, underscoring importance DNA repair preventing S. pneumoniae-induced genotoxicity. Taken together, study shows S. pneumoniae-induced damage host cell genome exacerbates toxicity pathogenesis, making DNA repair potentially important susceptibility factor people suffer pneumonia.
