 Nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase key enzyme control cellular concentrations nucleoside triphosphates, shown play important roles various cellular activities developmental control, signal transduction metastasis eukaryotic systems. study, gene NDP kinase Escherichia coli (ndk) disrupted surprisingly found dispensable without discernible effects cell growth morphology. However, mutator phenotype found ndk-disruption strains; frequencies spontaneous mutations rifampicin resistance nalidixic acid resistant significantly increased. higher frequency reversion mutations observed use amber mutation kanamycin-resistance gene ndk-disruption strain. Imbalance dNTP pools, particular significant increase dCTP content observed, likely result higher spontaneous mutation rates. results suggest NDP kinase, although essential, plays important role appropriate balance intracellular dNTP pools maintain high DNA replication fidelity. Strains ndk- pykA- pykF- well ndk- scs- constructed without discernible effect cell growth, indicating yet another enzyme(s) catalyzing nucleoside triphosphate synthesis, addition NDP kinase, pyruvate kinases succinyl CoA synthetase.
