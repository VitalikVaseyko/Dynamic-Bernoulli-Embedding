 Neuroblastoma (NB) common solid tumor infancy first cause death among preschool age diseases. availability several NB genomic profiles improves prognostic ability, outcome prediction pathology remains imperfect. previously produced novel prognostic gene signature based response NB cells hypoxia, condition tumor microenvironment strictly connected cancer aggressiveness. attempted define expression hypoxia-modulated specific genes, looking protein level NB specimens, considering particular hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), HIF-prolyl hydroxylase domain 3 (PHD3). evaluation expression performed Western blot immunocytochemistry NB cell lines immunohistochemistry tumor specimens. Stimulation HIF-1alpha PDK1 inhibition PHD3 expression observed NB cell lines cultured prolonged hypoxic conditions well tumors poor outcome. results indicate immunohistochemistry analysis protein expression PDK1, PHD3, HIF-1alpha defines hypoxic status NB tumors used simple relevant tool stratify high-risk patients.
