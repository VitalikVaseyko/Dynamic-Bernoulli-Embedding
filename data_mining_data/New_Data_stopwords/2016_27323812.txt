 tumor suppressor gene AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) frequently mutated cancers. modulation mechanism ARID1A PI3K/AKT signaling gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Here, found depletion endogenous ARID1A enhanced vitro proliferation, colony formation, cellular growth, nutrient uptake vivo xenograft tumor growth GC cells. PI3K/AKT activation ARID1A-silencing profiled using phospho-protein antibody array. phosphorylation PDK1, AKT, GSK3beta 70S6K, protein mRNA expressions PI3K PDK1, upregulated ARID1A-silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation luciferase reporter assay revealed ARID1A-involved SWI/SNF complex inhibited PIK3CA PDK1 transcription direct binding promoters. Serial deletion mutation analyses revealed ARID1A central region containing HIC1-binding domain, ARID DNA-binding domain C-terminal domain, essential inhibition GC cell growth, PI3K/AKT pathway phosphorylation transcriptional modulation activity PIK3CA PDK1. proliferation, cellular growth glucose consumption ARID1A-deficient GC cells efficiently prohibited allosteric inhibitors mk2206 LY294002, targeting AKT PI3K, respectively. inhibitors also downregulated phosphorylation PI3K/AKT pathway ARID1A-deficient GC cells. cells sensitized treatment LY294002, AT7867, another inhibitor AKT p70S6K. administration LY294002 alone inhibited vivo growth ARID1A- deficient GC cells mouse xenograft model. study provides novel insight modulatory function mechanism ARID1A PI3K/AKT signaling GC.
