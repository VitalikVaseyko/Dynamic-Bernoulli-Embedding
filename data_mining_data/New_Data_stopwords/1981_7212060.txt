 Isolated liver parenchymal cells rats fed 65% sucrose diet 14 days incubated presence absence 10(-6) glucagon. pyruvate kinase obtained homogenates glucagon-treated cells displayed increased Ks 0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate), well increased Ka 0.5 6-phosphogluconate (6-P-gluconate), compared pyruvate kinase untreated cells. Additionally, glucagon treatment decreased maximal stimulation pyruvate kinase 6-P-gluconate approximately two-thirds decreased Hill coefficient value pyruvate kinase 6-P-gluconate 1.76 1.56. 6-Aminonicotinamide, inhibitor 6-P-gluconate dehydrogenase, increased 6-P-gluconate levels isolated liver parenchymal cells three- sevenfold, depending substrates present. flux P-enolpyruvate pyruvate kinase increased 18 40% preparations highly correlated increase 6-P-gluconate levels. results suggest 6-P-gluconate could regulate pyruvate kinase activity intact liver parenchymal cell. Furthermore, activator would greatest importance lipogenic animal.
