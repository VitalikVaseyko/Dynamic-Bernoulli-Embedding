 Hypoxia universal driver aggressive tumor behavior, underlying mechanisms completely understood. Using phosphoproteomics screen, show active Akt accumulates mitochondria hypoxia phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) Thr346 inactivate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. turn, pathway switches tumor metabolism toward glycolysis, antagonizes apoptosis autophagy, dampens oxidative stress, maintains tumor cell proliferation face severe hypoxia. Mitochondrial Akt-PDK1 signaling correlates unfavorable prognostic markers shorter survival glioma patients may provide "actionable" therapeutic target cancer.
