 BACKGROUND: Cancer development involves "injury" respiratory machinery (Warburg effect) due decreased impaired mitochondrial function. circumstance results regulation ATPase subunits malignant tissue. objective work assess compare relative expression mRNA mitochondrial ATPase subunits samples thyroid cancer benign nodules. MATERIAL METHODS: Samples 31 patients operation PTC General Hospital Mexico snap-frozen stored -70 degrees C. Thirty-five patients operation benign tumors also included study. mRNA expression levels alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon subunits F1 "c12" subunit Fo determined real-time RT-PCR (by duplicate), order determine abnormal expression genes could partially explain Warburg effect papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). RESULTS: ATP5E transcript alteration (down-expression) highly associated PTC diagnosis OR=11.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.245-237.98; p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Relative down-expression ATP5E transcript highly associated PTC diagnosis. transcript alteration may used tumoral marker papillary thyroid cancer.
