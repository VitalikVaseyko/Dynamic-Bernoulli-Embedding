 Intracellular enzymes erythrocytes made accessible situ kinetic studies treating cells bifunctional reagents crosslink proteins, thus creating network allows subsequent permeabilization delipidation without escape intracellular proteins. Dimethyl suberimidate, dimethyl 3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate, toluene-2,4-diisocyanate used successfully crosslinking reagents, digitonin used delipidation. systematic study situ behavior 11 glycolytic enzymes rat erythrocytes, observed Km Vmax values majority enzymes essentially situ vitro. Lactate dehydrogenase (L-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27) inhibited excess pyruvate much situ vitro. Hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) allosterically inhibited glucose 6-phosphate nearly much situ vitro affected 2,3-biphosphoglycerate. allosteric properties 6-phosphofructokinase (ATP:D-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11), glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase [D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1.2.1.12], pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) situ qualitatively similar observed vitro, important quantitative differences noticed. Particularly striking much greater activity phosphofructokinase situ compared vitro physiological concentrations effector metabolites.
