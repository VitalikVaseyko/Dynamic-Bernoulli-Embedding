 Pyruvate effects metabolism Clostridium acetobutylicum glucose fermentation studied. addition culture medium, pyruvate rapidly used, provoking several changes metabolic pattern bacteria. pyruvate addition occurred early fermentation, glucose utilization decreased solventogenic phase induced. pyruvate added solventogenesis, glucose consumption slightly affected cells fermented substrates simultaneously: however, acidogenic phase started detriment solvent formation. Usually, solvent phase, cells remetabolized acetic butyric acids solvents, pyruvate added, utilization acids stopped specific rates acetate butyrate formation increased immediately. acidogenic growth phase characterized high levels acetate butyrate kinase dropped solvent phase. Addition pyruvate limited shift two enzymes levels activities remained constant course fermentation. Conversely, acetoacetate decarboxylase, characteristic solvent phase, decreased sharply presence pyruvate. fact specific rate glucose consumption decreased pyruvate metabolism, cosubstrate, proves phosphoroclastic reaction limiting step. Furthermore, pyruvate utilization represented promising approach obtain useful data intracellular compounds implicated mechanism switching acidogenic solventogenic phase.
