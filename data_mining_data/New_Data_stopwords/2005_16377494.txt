 BACKGROUND: Resuscitation racemic lactated Ringer's solution induces cellular apoptosis. study conducted determine elimination D-lactate isomer would attenuate apoptosis liver, investigate possible mechanisms. STUDY DESIGN: Sprague Dawley rats (n=30, 5 per group) subjected modified volume-controlled hemorrhage randomized following groups: hemorrhage (sham); resuscitation (NR); resuscitation racemic lactated Ringer's (DL-LR); L-isomer LR (L-LR); ketone (beta-hydroxybuturate) Ringer's (KR); pyruvate Ringer's (PR). Animals sacrificed 2 hours later expressions proapoptotic proteins (BAD), antiapoptotic (bcl-2) proteins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage liver analyzed Western blotting. Contribution phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/serine/threonine kinase (PI3k/Akt) pathway assessed measuring total phosphorylated PI3K, Akt, BAD, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) proteins. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay used detect apoptotic cells. Liver ATP levels measured using luciferase reaction assay. RESULTS: Hemorrhage significantly decreased hepatic ATP level resuscitation improved it, returned normal L-isomer lactated Ringer's ketone Ringer's groups. Expression proapoptotic proteins significantly lower pyruvate Ringer's ketone Ringer's groups; L-isomer lactated Ringer's pyruvate Ringer's resuscitation significantly increased bcl-2 expression. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase fragmentation total number apoptotic cells significantly increased racemic lactated Ringer's group. significant induction Akt activity changes phosphorylated BAD, Akt, eNOS levels. CONCLUSIONS: Resuscitation racemic lactated Ringer's induces hepatic apoptosis, decreased D-isomer lactate eliminated. Apoptosis reduced even lactate substituted beta-hydroxybutyrate pyruvate. beneficial effects improvements energy status activation PI3K/Akt pathway.
