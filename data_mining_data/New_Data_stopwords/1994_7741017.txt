 summary, propose acute ammonia intoxication leads increased extracellular concentration glutamate brain results activation NMDA receptor. Activation receptor mediates ATP depletion ammonia toxicity since blocking NMDA receptor MK-801 prevents phenomena. Ammonia-induced metabolic alterations (in glycogen, glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glutamine, glutamate, etc) prevented MK-801 and, therefore, seems play direct role ammonia-induced ATP depletion molecular mechanism acute ammonia toxicity. results suggest ammonia-induced ATP depletion due activation Na+/K(+)-ATPase, which, turn, consequence decreased phosphorylation protein kinase C. due decreased activity PKC increased activity protein phosphatase. also show L-carnitine prevents glutamate toxicity primary neuronal cultures. results shown indicate carnitine increases affinity glutamate quisqualate type (including metabotropic) glutamate receptors. Also, blocking metabotropic receptor AP-3 prevents protective effect L-carnitine, indicating activation receptor mediates protective effect carnitine. suggest protective effect carnitine acute ammonia toxicity animals due protection glutamate neurotoxicity according mechanisms.
