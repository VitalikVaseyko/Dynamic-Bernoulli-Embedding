 Simian Virus 40 (SV40) paradigm pathogen multivalent binding sites sphingolipid GM1, via induces endocytosis infection. report SV40 also utilizes cell surface integrins activate signaling networks required infection, even absence previously implicated glycosphingolipids. identify ILK, PDK1, RhoGAP GRAF1 RhoA core nodes signaling network activated upon SV40 engagement integrins. show integrin-mediated signaling host SV40 engagement induces de-phosphorylation Ezrin leading uncoupling plasma membrane cortical actin. results provide functional evidence mechanism SV40 activates signal transduction human epithelial cells via integrins context clathrin-independent endocytosis.
