 many bacteria, pyruvate kinase serves well-defined function glycolysis, catalyzing ATP-generating reaction. However, role growth carbon sources requiring glucoeneogenesis less well investigated. analyzed defined pyruvate kinase gene (pyk) deletion mutant Corynebacterium glutamicum, unable grow ribose sole carbon source. Unexpectedly, pyk deletion mutant also unable grow acetate citrate sole carbon sources unless low amounts pyruvate added growth medium. spontaneous suppressor mutant pyk deletion strain regained ability grow acetate isolated. DNA microarray experiments revealed increased expression malic enzyme gene malE. point mutation upstream malE identified mutant responsible loss carbon-source-dependent regulation, revealed transcriptional fusion analysis. Overexpression malE sufficient restore growth pyk deletion strain acetate citrate. requirement increased malic enzyme levels re-route carbon flux interface glycolysis, gluconeogenesis tricarboxylic acid cycle order compensate absence pyruvate kinase indicates metabolic flux bifurcation metabolic node phosphoenolpyruvate. Whereas growth C. glutamicum acetate citrate phosphoenolpyruvate generated oxaloacetate metabolized gluconeogenesis, fraction converted pyruvate kinase glycolytic direction sustain proper pyruvate availability biomass synthesis.
