 Pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle catalyzes ATP-dependent phosphorylation glycolate yield 2-phosphoglycolate (F. J. Kayne (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 59, 8-13). investigation anologous reactions alpha-substituted carboxylic acids reveals several new substrates phosphorylation reaction. Thus alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids L-lactate, D-lactate, DL-alpha-hydroxybutyrate, DL-alpha-hydroxyvalerate, L-glycerate, D-glycerate, DL-nitrolactate, DL-beta-chlorolactate phosphorylated alpha-hydroxy group give corresponding phosphoesters. Thioglycolate also slow substrate phosphorylation thiol group give phosphothioglycolate, DL-thiolactate phosphorylated slow reaction give phosphothiolactate. beta-Hydroxypyruvate substrate; but, unlike reaction pyruvate, beta-hydroxypyruvate equilibrium reaction lies favor ADP phosphorylated product appears 31P NMR data tartronate-semialdehyde-2-phosphate. 31P NMR spectroscopy used verify identity products reactions. Steady-state kinetic constants obtained rapid reactions. reactions glycolate, L-glycerate, beta-hydroxypyruvate kcat values close phosphorylation pyruvate reverse physiological reaction.
