 order improve knowledge mechanisms underlying alterations energy metabolism recently observed skeletal muscle patients suffering chronic renal failure, study designed test (1) whether changes activity key enzymes energy metabolism occur muscle patients, (2) whether different muscle fiber types equally altered metabolic machinery. this, maximum activities 14 enzymes measured individual muscle fibers microdissected biopsies rectus abdominis muscle obtained seven normal subjects seven patients end-stage renal failure renal replacement therapy. large decrease activities beta-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme dehydrogenase, key enzyme beta-oxidation pathway, citrate synthase, initiates tricarboxylic acid cycle, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, contributes synthesis glycogen lactate, observed three fiber types (slow-twitch oxidative, fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic, fast-twitch glycolytic). smaller reduction activities phosphofructokinase and/or pyruvate kinase, two key enzymes glycolysis, also observed slow-twitch oxidative and/or fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibers. results demonstrate abnormalities muscle energy metabolism observed patients chronic renal failure due, least part, intrinsic changes key enzymes major energy-providing pathways; also offer satisfactory explanation defect oxidative metabolism recently demonstrated muscle patients.
