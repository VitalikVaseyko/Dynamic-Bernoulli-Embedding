 Ranolazine shown anti-anginal efficacy humans cardiac anti-ischaemic activity models, without affecting haemodynamics baseline contraction. isolated normoxic rat hearts, Langendorff-perfused 30 min 11 mM glucose, 3% albumin, 0.4 mM 0.8 mM palmitate, 20 microM ranolazine significantly increased active, dephosphorylated, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa), palmitate 1.2 mM palmitate. Dichloroactetate (DCA, 1 mM), PDHa kinase inhibitor, significantly increased PDHa hearts perfused 0, 0.4 0.8 mM 1.2 mM palmitate. PDHa significantly increased 1.2 mM palmitate DCA plus ranolazine, additive effects also seen 0.8 mM palmitate. Activation PDH ranolazine promotion glucose oxidation offers plausible means drug may anti-ischaemic nonhaemodynamically. Extensive studies extracted enzymes isolated rat heart mitochondria failed demonstrate effects ranolazine PDH kinase phosphatase, PDH catalytic activity, whereas effects known effectors (such DCA) readily demonstrable, suggesting ranolazine activates PDH indirectly. analyses hearts revealed ranolazine reduced acetyl CoA content conditions fatty acid present, +/- DCA little effect. absence fatty acid, ranolazine and/or DCA raised acetyl CoA. perfusions octanoate (+/- albumin) replaced palmitate, ranolazine still decreased acetyl CoA, acetate replaced palmitate. octanoate-perfused hearts, contents C4, C6 C8 CoA esters increased ranolazine. consistent ranolazine causing inhibition fatty acid beta-oxidation leading decreased acetyl CoA activation PDH.
