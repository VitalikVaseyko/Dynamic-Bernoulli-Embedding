 Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase shows biphasic decay pattern red blood cell aging, fast first part cell's life span circulation. decay due accumulation inactive enzyme molecules, shown immunological studies, accompanied formation secondary isozymes (i.e., chemically modified forms). Electrophoretic ion-exchange chromatographic experiments show glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (D-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9) consists one isozymic form young erythrocytes present two components, different electric charge, mature old cells. secondary isozyme stable heat treatment inactivated IgG anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase lower affinity native isozyme. vitro incubation homogeneous human glucose-6-phosphate isomerase conditions known produce enzyme deamination reproduce isozymic pattern found erythrocytes, suggesting one mechanisms previously described explain glucose-6-phosphate isomerase microheterogeneity occur human erythrocyte.
