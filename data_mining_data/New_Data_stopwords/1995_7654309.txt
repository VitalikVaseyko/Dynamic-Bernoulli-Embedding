 Microbial cultures typically produce acids metabolizing common carbon source, glucose. Acid production represents waste carbon, accumulation limit cell concentration culture stability, thereby reducing productivity. basis prior work, acid production attributed due mismatch glycolytic tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle capacities. suppress acid production, strategy entailing adding citrate glucose minimal medium proved extremely effective. effect citrate in-vivo flux distribution quantified using detailed flux-model. molar glucose-citrate ratio varied 3 6, significant reduction glycolytic flux essentially complete suppression acid formation found compared chemostat cultures grown solely glucose. Adding biosynthetic precursors glutamine invoke suppression, thus indicating citrate's effect regulatory level. hypothesized reduction glycolytic flux presence citrate results transport coupled uptake divalent metal ions. Citrate transport alters intracellular balance metal ions turn could trigger sophisticated series metabolic events leading reduction activities pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase (PFK), regulatory enzymes glycolysis. basis scenario regulatory information, pyruvate kinase emerged potential metabolic engineering site. deactivation Bacillus subtilis Escherichia coli strains expected yield constructs much lower tendency making acid byproducts.
