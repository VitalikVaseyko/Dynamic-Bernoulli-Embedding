 transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) induces battery cytoprotective genes oxidative stress. Nrf2 aids liver regeneration altering insulin signaling; however, whether Nrf2 participates hepatic glucose homeostasis unknown. Compared wild-type mice, mice lacking Nrf2 (Nrf2-null) lower basal serum insulin prolonged hyperglycemia response intraperitoneal glucose challenge. present study, blood glucose, serum insulin, urine flow rate, hepatic expression glucose-related genes quantified male diabetic wild-type Nrf2-null mice. Type 1 diabetes induced single intraperitoneal dose (200 mg/kg) streptozotocin (STZ). Histopathology serum insulin levels confirmed depleted pancreatic beta-cells STZ-treated mice genotypes. Five days STZ, Nrf2-null mice higher blood glucose levels wild-type mice. Nine days STZ, polyuria occurred genotypes urine output Nrf2-null mice (11-fold) wild-type mice (7-fold). Moreover, STZ-treated Nrf2-null mice higher levels serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, triglycerides, fatty acids 10 days STZ compared wild-type mice. STZ reduced hepatic glycogen genotypes, less observed Nrf2-null mice. Increased urine output blood glucose STZ-treated Nrf2-null mice corresponded enhanced gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase)- reduced glycolysis (pyruvate kinase)-related mRNA expression livers. Furthermore, Nrf2 activator oltipraz lowered blood glucose wild-type Nrf2-null mice administered STZ. Collectively, data indicate absence Nrf2 worsens hyperglycemia type diabetic mice Nrf2 may represent therapeutic target reducing circulating glucose levels.
