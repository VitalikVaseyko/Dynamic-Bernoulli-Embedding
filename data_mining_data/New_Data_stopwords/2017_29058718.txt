 Metabolic reprogramming hallmark cancer. Herein discover key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), related isoform PKM1, methylated co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). PKM2 methylation reversibly shifts balance metabolism oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis breast cancer cells. Oxidative phosphorylation depends mitochondrial calcium concentration, becomes critical cancer cell survival PKM2 methylation blocked. interacting suppressing expression inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs), methylated PKM2 inhibits influx calcium endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria. Inhibiting PKM2 methylation competitive peptide delivered nanoparticles perturbs metabolic energy balance cancer cells, leading decrease cell proliferation, migration metastasis. Collectively, CARM1-PKM2 axis serves metabolic reprogramming mechanism tumorigenesis, inhibiting PKM2 methylation generates metabolic vulnerability InsP3R-dependent mitochondrial functions.
