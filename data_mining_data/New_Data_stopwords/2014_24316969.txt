 considerable resurgence interest role aerobic glycolysis cancer; however, increased glycolysis frequently viewed consequence oncogenic events drive malignant cell growth survival. provide evidence increased glycolytic activation oncogenic event physiologically relevant 3D culture model. Overexpression glucose transporter type 3 (GLUT3) nonmalignant human breast cells activated known oncogenic signaling pathways, including EGFR, beta1 integrin, MEK, AKT, leading loss tissue polarity increased growth. Conversely, reduction glucose uptake malignant cells promoted formation organized growth-arrested structures basal polarity, suppressed oncogenic pathways. Unexpectedly importantly, found unlike reported literature, 3D differences "normal" malignant phenotypes could explained HIF-1alpha/2alpha, AMPK, mTOR pathways. Loss epithelial integrity involved activation RAP1 via exchange protein directly activated cAMP (EPAC), involving also O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification downstream hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. former, turn, mediated pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) interaction soluble adenylyl cyclase. findings show increased glucose uptake activates known oncogenic pathways induce malignant phenotype, provide possible targets diagnosis therapeutics.
