 "Warburg effect", enhanced glycolysis aerobic glycolysis, confers cancer cells ability survive proliferate even stressed conditions. study, explored role epidermal growth factor (EGF) orchestrating Warburg effect, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, acquisition cancer stem-like cell properties human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. results showed EGF induces EMT process OSCC cells, correlates acquisition cancer stem-like properties, including enrichment CD44+/CD24- population cancer cells increased expression CSC-related genes, aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) Bmi-1. also showed EGF concomitantly enhanced L-lactate production, blocking glycolysis 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) robustly reversed EGF-induced EMT process CSC-like properties OSCC cells. Mechanistically, demonstrated EGF promoted EMT process CSC generation EGFR/PI3K/HIF-1alpha axis-orchestrated glycolysis. Using orthotopic tumor model human OSCC (UM-SCC1) injected tongue BALB/c nude mice, showed treatment 2-DG vivo significantly inhibited metastasis tumor cells regional cervical lymph nodes reduced expression ALDH1 vimentin situ tumors tumor cell-invaded regional lymph nodes. Taken together, findings unveiled new mechanism EGF drives OSCC metastasis induction EMT process CSC generation, driven enhanced glycolytic metabolic program OSCC cells.
