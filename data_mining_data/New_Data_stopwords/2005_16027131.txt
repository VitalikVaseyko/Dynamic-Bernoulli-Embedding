 BACKGROUND AIMS: Anoxia-tolerant plant tissues synthesize number proteins anoxia, addition 'classical anaerobic proteins' involved glycolysis fermentation. present study used model system rice coleoptile tips elucidate patterns protein synthesis anoxia-tolerant plant tissue. METHODS: Coleoptile tips 7-11 mm long excised intact seedlings exposed anoxia, excised hypoxically pre-treated seedlings exposed anoxia 72 h. Total proteins 35S-labelled proteins extracted, separated using two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysed using mass spectrometry. KEY RESULTS: coleoptile tips excised intact seedlings exposed anoxia 72 h similar proteome tips first excised exposed anoxia. 72 h anoxia, Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitors glycine-rich RNA-binding protein decreased abundance, whereas nucleoside diphosphate kinase several proteins unknown functions strongly enhanced. Using [35S]methionine label, proteins synthesized high levels anoxia, also aeration, included nucleoside diphosphate kinase, glycine-rich RNA-binding protein, putative elicitor-inducible protein putative actin-depolymerizing factor. Proteins synthesized predominately anoxia included pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), alcohol dehydrogenase 1 2, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase protein unknown function. CONCLUSION: induction PPDK anoxic rice coleoptiles might, combination pyruvate kinase (PK), enable operation 'substrate cycle' producing PPi ATP. Production PPi would (a) direct energy crucial transport processes across tonoplast (i.e. H+-PPiase); (b) required sucrose hydrolysis via sucrose synthase; (c) enable acceleration glycolysis, via pyrophosphate:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP) acting parallel phosphofructokinase (PFK), thus enhancing ATP production anoxic rice coleoptiles; ATP production would need increased substantial requirement PPi.
