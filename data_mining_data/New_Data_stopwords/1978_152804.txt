 Vitamin toxicity, caused oral administration 30,000 IU vitamin (retinyl palmitate) young rats (70 90 g) daily 2 days, increased levels lipids, glycogen, citrate liver. Furthermore, hypervitaminosis decreased activities two key hepatic glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, without affecting hexokinase glucokinase. suggested, therefore, addition increased activities key gluconeogenic enzymes, reported earlier, marked decrease activities phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase elevated level citrate liver could account enhanced gluconeogenesis hypervitaminosis A.
