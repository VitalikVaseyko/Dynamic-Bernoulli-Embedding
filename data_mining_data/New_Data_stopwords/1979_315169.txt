 rates 14carbon incorporation CO2 glycogen [U-14C]-lactate [1-14C]acetate frog sartorius muscles compared. rates incorporation CO2 similar, rate incorporation lactate glycogen 200-fold larger acetate incorporation. concluded pathway lactate incorporation glycogen involve Krebs cycle intermediates extramitochondrial. test possibility pathway lactate incorporation involves net reversal pyruvate kinase, changes phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate concentrations stimulation lactate incorporation glycogen measured. wer none. mass action ratio pyruvate kinase calculated. value two orders magnitude equilibrium constant concluded reversal pyruvate kinase unlikely pathway. test possibility pathway involving oxaloacetate-to-phosphoenolpyruvate step involved muscles treated 3-mercaptopicolinate, inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. treatment resulted decreased incorporation lactate glycogen.
