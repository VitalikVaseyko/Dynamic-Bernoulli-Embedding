 well established caloric restriction extends life span significantly retards rate occurrence age-associated degenerative disease processes. paucity data exists relative mechanisms caloric restriction accomplishes events. examined effect caloric restriction rats several hepatic enzymes intermediary metabolism. activities glycolytic supporting enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase decreased response caloric restriction. Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase creatine phosphokinase altered. Likewise, enzymes associated lipid metabolism (malic enzyme glycerokinase) reduced (fatty acid synthetase reduced, statistically significant degree). Activities enzymes supporting gluconeogenesis (glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, tyrosine aminotransferase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, amino acid oxidase, malate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphatase) either unchanged increased significantly caloric restriction. Glucagon levels decreased. Comparisons young ad libitum fed older calorically restricted rats revealed similar identical metabolic activity. results suggest caloric restriction produces effect intermediary metabolism, favoring role glucagon glucose synthesis; limiting role insulin glucose catabolism liver. former observation provides efficient support peripheral tissues latter level energy production necessary self maintenance. Limited lipid metabolism suggests decreased potential fatty acid epoxide formation free radical damage cellular macromolecules. Additionally, caloric restriction may delay progressive age associated changes activities enzymes investigated.
