 intimate, yet poorly understood, link cellular metabolic status, cell signalling transcription. Central metabolic pathways control signalling pathways and, vice versa, cellular metabolic profile influences cell signalling incorporation various metabolic sensors signalling networks. Thus information nutrients availability directly crucially influences crucial cell decisions. present review, summarize current knowledge various metabolic sensors give examples integration metabolically derived inputs signalling system regulation transcription. also discuss Warburg effect cross-talk metabolism signalling used orchestrate rapid cell growth division. becoming clear future research concentrate collection small-molecule metabolites, whose concentration fluctuates response cellular energy levels, searching sensors connect signalling transcriptional networks.
