 contrast normal differentiated cells, rely primarily mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation generate energy needed cellular processes, cancer cells instead rely aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect." Aerobic glycolysis inefficient way generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, advantage confers cancer cells unclear. propose metabolism cancer cells, indeed proliferating cells, adapted facilitate uptake incorporation nutrients biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, lipids) needed produce new cell. Supporting idea recent studies showing (i) several signaling pathways implicated cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways incorporate nutrients biomass; (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells acquire metabolize nutrients manner conducive proliferation rather efficient ATP production. better understanding mechanistic links cellular metabolism growth control may ultimately lead better treatments human cancer.
