 Although amino acid sequences structures pyruvate kinase (PYK) isozymes highly conserved, allosteric regulations differ. suggests amino acids low conservation play important roles allosteric mechanism. current work exploits 'natural screen'- 122 point mutations identified human gene encoding erythrocyte PYK isozyme associated nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia - learn amino acid positions PYK may important allosteric regulations. addition mutations, consider conservation amino acid position across 241 PYK sequences. Three groups residue positions created, with: (1) disease causing mutation identified; (2) disease causing mutation identified high conservation across isozymes; (3) disease causing mutation identified low conservation. Mutations positions identified natural screen likely tolerated minimal loss function. Mutations highly conserved positions likely disrupt properties common PYK isozymes (e.g., structure, catalysis). Residues third group likely involved roles necessary function common isozymes (e.g., allostery). Many Group 3 residues located C-domain lesser extent domain.
