 Posthepatectomy coma produced 13 dogs cerebrums biopsied analysis concentrations glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, lactate, citrate, alpha-ketogulutarate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate, adenosinetriphosphate, ammonia, glutamine well activities glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme. differences normal brain glycolytic substrate concentrations. Four Krebs cycle substrates significantly reduced, differently dogs sedated 24 hours. glycolytic pathway, Krebs cycle, related enzyme activities significantly altered. Cerebral adenosine triphosphate concentration unchanged concentrations ammonia glutamine increased threefold.
