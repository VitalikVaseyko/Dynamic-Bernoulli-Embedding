 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) syndrome pulmonary vascular cross sectional area compliance reduced vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling, inflammation. Vascular remodeling results part increased proliferation impaired apoptosis vascular cells. resulting increase afterload promotes right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) RV failure. Recently identified mitochondrial-metabolic abnormalities PAH, notably pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-mediated inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), result aerobic glycolysis lung vasculature RV. glycolytic shift diagnostic importance since detectable early experimental PAH increased lung RV uptake (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. metabolic shift also pathophysiologic therapeutic relevance. RV myocytes, glycolytic switch reduces contractility vasculature renders cells hyperproliferative apoptosis-resistant. Reactivation PDH achieved directly PDK inhibition (using dichloroacetate), indirectly via activating Randle cycle, using inhibitors fatty acid oxidation (FAO), trimetazidine ranolazine. experimental PAH RVH, PDK inhibition increases glucose oxidation, enhances RV function, regresses pulmonary vascular disease reducing proliferation enhancing apoptosis, restores cardiac repolarization. FAO inhibition increases RV glucose oxidation RV function experimental RVH. trigger metabolic remodeling RV lung differ. RV, metabolic remodeling likely triggered ischemia (due microvascular rarefaction and/or reduced coronary perfusion pressure). vasculature, metabolic changes result redox-mediated activation transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, consequence epigenetic silencing SOD2 and/or changes mitochondrial fission/fusion. Randomized controlled trials required assess whether benefits enhancing glucose oxidation realized patients PAH.
