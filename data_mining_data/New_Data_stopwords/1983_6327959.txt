 Zinc cation performed role activator well inhibitor production lactate glucose 6-phosphate cytosol fraction rat muscle. pH optimum glycolysis 7.3 Zn2+ acted activator. concentrations lower 0.46 mM, Zn2+ shown effective activator Mg2+ apparent K 1/2 approximately 0.1 mM. However, concentrations higher 0.5 mM, Zn2+ inhibited lactate production. activatory well inhibitory effect Zn2+ lactate production investigated estimation glycolytic intermediates. crossover plot, lactate production reflected phosphofructokinase activity, Zn2+ used catalytic cation reactions. Phosphofructokinase activity purified muscle activated Zn2+ apparent Km approximately 0.05 mM, high Zn2+ concentrations, enzyme activity inhibited I50 0.23 mM presence ATP. findings, appears lactate production might also depend phosphofructokinase activity Zn2+ used activating cation.
