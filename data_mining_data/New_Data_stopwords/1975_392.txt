 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, isolated chicken liver mitochondria essentially homogenous form, carries irreversible decarboxylation oxalacetate pyruvate presence catalytic amounts GDP IDP, well reversible decarboxylation oxalacetate phosphoenolpyruvate presence substrate amounts GTP ITP. pyruvate- phosphoenolpyruvate-forming reactions similar nucleoside specificity appear carried protein. However, two activities vary markedly response added metal ions sulfhydryl reagents. Phosphoenolpyruvate formation completely dependent presence divalent metal ion, Mn2+ effective species. reaction also stimulated sulfhydryl reagents 2-mercaptoethanol. contrast, pyruvate-forming reaction strongly inhibited divalent metal ions, including Mn2+, also moderate concentrations sulfhydryl reagents. observations demonstration pyruvate kinase-like activity low absent make unlikely pyruvate formation proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate intermediate. Although pyruvate-forming reaction inhibited added metal ions, reaction also inhibited metal-chelating agents 8-hydroxyquinoline o-phenanthroline, suggesting reaction dependent presence metal ion. possible, however, demonstrate enzyme metalloprotein.
