 mouse response acute Salmonella typhimurium infection complex, influence several genes, well environmental factors. previous study, identified two novel Salmonella susceptibility loci, Ity4 Ity5, (AcB61 x 129S6)F2 cross. peak logarithm odds score associated Ity4 maps region liver red blood cell (RBC)-specific pyruvate kinase (Pklr) gene, previously shown mutated AcB61. Plasmodium chabaudi infection, Pklr mutation protects mice parasite, indicated improved survival lower peak parasitemia. Given RBC defects previously associated resistance malaria susceptibility Salmonella, hypothesized Pklr gene underlying Ity4 confers susceptibility acute S. typhimurium infection mice. Using fine mapping approach combined complementation studies, comparative studies, functional analysis, show Pklr gene underlying Ity4 confers susceptibility acute S. typhimurium infection mice effect RBC turnover iron metabolism.
