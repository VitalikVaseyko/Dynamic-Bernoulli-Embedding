 known pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM), rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, essential roles Warburg effect expression cancer-dominant PKM2 increased polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), splicer PKM gene. words, PKM2 acts promoter Warburg effect. Previously, demonstrated Warburg effect partially established down-regulation several microRNAs (miRs) bind PTBP1 ectopic expression miRs suppressed Warburg effect. study, investigated functions miR-1 -133b, well known muscle-specific miRs, viewpoint Warburg effect colorectal tumors. expression levels miR-1 -133b relatively high colon tissue except muscle frequently down-regulated 75 clinical colorectal tumors samples, even adenomas, compared adjacent normal tissue samples. ectopic expression miRs induced growth suppression autophagic cell death switching PKM isoform expression PKM2 PKM1 silencing PTBP1 expression vitro vivo. Also, showed resultant increase intracellular level reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved mechanism. Furthermore, PTBP1 highly expressed 30 clinical colorectal tumor samples examined, even adenomas. results suggested PTBP1 PTBP1-associated miR-1 -133b crucial molecules maintenance Warburg effect colorectal tumors.
