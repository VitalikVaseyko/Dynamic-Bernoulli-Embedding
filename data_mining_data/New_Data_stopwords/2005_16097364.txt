 Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyzes conversion dopamine norepinephrine released sympathetic neurons circulation. Several lines evidence, including finding elevated plasma DBH activity essential hypertension, suggest important role DBH hypertension. Recently, novel polymorphism (-1021C/T) 5' flanking region DBH gene shown account 35-52% variation plasma DBH activity. therefore investigated possible association DBH -1021C/T polymorphism hypertension large Japanese population. Moreover, development hypertension considered due least partly gene-environmental interactions, also investigated possible interactions DBH -1021C/T polymorphism environmental factors. Consequently, found significant interaction DBH -1021C/T polymorphism fasting plasma glucose (FPG) association hypertension. CC homozygotes showed steeper increase probability hypertension FPG allele carriers. also found marginally significant trend suggesting presence interaction DBH -1021C/T polymorphism FPG association blood pressure. Consistent presence interaction, found 19 bp sequence containing DBH -1021C/T polymorphism includes two palindromic non-canonical E boxes separated 5 bps, closely resembles glucose response element L-type pyruvate kinase gene. findings could helpful conducting molecular biological studies relationship among glucose metabolism, sympathetic nervous system, hypertension.
