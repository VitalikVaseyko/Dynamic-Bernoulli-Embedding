 BACKGROUND: Ethyl pyruvate (EP) possesses anti-inflammatory activity. However, potential anti-nociceptive value EP treatment inflammatory nociception largely unknown. investigated whether EP could anti-nociceptive effect inflammatory pain, systemic administration EP (10, 50, 100 mg/kg, i.p.), 1 hour formalin (5%, 50 mul) injection plantar surface hind paws rats. RESULTS: EP significantly decreased formalin-induced nociceptive behavior phase II, magnitude paw edema, activation c-Fos L4-L5 spinal dorsal horn. EP also attenuated phosphorylation extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) neurons L4-L5 spinal dorsal horn formalin injection. Interestingly, i.t. administration PD98059, ERK upstream kinase (MEK) inhibitor, completely blocked formalin-induced inflammatory nociceptive responses. CONCLUSIONS: results demonstrate EP may effectively inhibit formalin-induced inflammatory nociception via inhibition neuronal ERK phosphorylation spinal dorsal horn, indicating therapeutic potential suppressing acute inflammatory pain.
