 assay triglycerides entirely enzymatic pathway adapted use GSA II Greiner. method requires 20 microliters biological material. reaction time short: 8 min 37 degrees C. coefficient variation exceed 6% period one month. Linearity measurements verified level 4 mmol/l. shown free glycerol level systematically measured deducted total glycerol assure accurate results. stability plasma triglycerides investigated function length temperature storage (+4 degrees C -196 degrees C). free glycerol increases function time, whereas level triglycerides stays constant. Haemoglobin various medicaments, particular, hypolipemiants hypoglycemiants, interfere.
