 Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) monogenic metabolic disease caused mutations PKLR gene leads hemolytic anemia variable symptomatology fatal neonatal period. PKD recessive inheritance trait curative treatment allogeneic bone marrow transplantation provide ideal scenario developing gene therapy approaches. Here, provide preclinical gene therapy PKD based lentiviral vector harboring hPGK eukaryotic promoter drives expression PKLR cDNA. therapeutic vector used transduce mouse PKD hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) subsequently transplanted myeloablated PKD mice. Ectopic RPK expression normalized erythroid compartment correcting hematological phenotype reverting organ pathology. Metabolomic studies demonstrated functional correction glycolytic pathway RBCs derived genetically corrected PKD HSCs, metabolic disturbances leukocytes. analysis lentiviral insertion sites genome transplanted hematopoietic cells demonstrated evidence genotoxicity transplanted animals. Overall, results underscore therapeutic potential hPGK-coRPK lentiviral vector provide high expectations toward gene therapy PKD erythroid metabolic genetic disorders.
