 level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate maximal activities key gluconeogenic glycolytic enzymes determined liver rat model chronic uremia ad libitum-fed control pair-fed control animals. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate decreased uremia level negatively correlated concentration blood urea nitrogen. changes gluconeogenic enzymes uremic rats different pair-fed controls. However, pyruvate kinase decreased uremia compared controls. studies offer possible mechanism role liver carbohydrate intolerance uremia.
