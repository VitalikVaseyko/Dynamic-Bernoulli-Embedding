 Toxic doses acetaminophen (AA) cause hepatocellular necrosis. Evidence suggests activated macrophages contribute pathogenic process; however, factors activate cells unknown. studies, assessed role mediators released AA-injured hepatocytes macrophage activation. Treatment macrophages conditioned medium (CM) collected 24hr treatment mouse hepatocytes 5mM AA (CM-AA) resulted increased production reactive oxygen species (ROS). Macrophage expression heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalase mRNA also upregulated CM-AA, well cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX). CM-AA also upregulated expression proinflammatory chemokines, MIP-1alpha MIP-2. effects CM-AA expression COX-2, MIP-1alpha MIP-2 inhibited blockade p44/42 MAP kinase, suggesting biochemical mechanism mediating macrophage activation. Hepatocytes injured AA found release HMGB1, potent macrophage activator. inhibited pretreatment hepatocytes ethyl pyruvate (EP), blocks HMGB1 release. EP also blocked CM-AA induced ROS production antioxidant expression, reduced expression COX-2, MIP-1alpha MIP-2. findings suggest HMGB1 released AA-injured hepatocytes contributes macrophage activation. supported observation expression HMGB1 receptor RAGE upregulated macrophages response CM-AA. data indicate AA-injured hepatocytes contribute inflammatory environment liver release mediators HMGB1. Blocking HMGB1/RAGE may useful approach limiting classical macrophage activation AA-induced hepatotoxicity.
