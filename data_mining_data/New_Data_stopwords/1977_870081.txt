 type isozymes Pyruvate-kinase studied isoelectrofocusing thin layer acrylamide ampholine gel, ontogeny rat muscle vivo differentiation vitro myoblasts line established Yaffe. cases, multiple subbands seen; acid (pHi 5.2) predominant band myoblasts fetal muscle 15th day. Several cathodic bands appear sequentially vitro vivo, one corresponding "M2" "K" band (predominant kidney). cathodic band M1 (pHi 7.3), characteristic adult muscle, appears 9th day culture vitro multinucleated myotubes 20th day fetal life vivo. Kinetic results confirm electrofocusing results, showing fetal muscle myoblasts sigmoid saturation curve pyruvate kinase activity phosphoenolpyruvate substrate. allosteric kinetic progressively replaced Michaelian kinetics vitro vivo. Consequently, studies vitro may serve model myogenesis vivo, may contribute understanding significance multiple forms pyruvate-kinase myogenesis.
