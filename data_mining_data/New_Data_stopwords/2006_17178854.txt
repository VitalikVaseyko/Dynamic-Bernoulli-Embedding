 precursor metaplastic mucosal lesion predisposes esophageal adenocarcinoma Barrett's esophagus. signal transduction events occur Barrett's esophagus poorly understood, study aimed generating comprehensive description cellular kinase activity Barrett's esophagus, normal squamous esophagus, gastric cardia gain insight pathogenesis Barrett's esophagus. Peptide arrays, exhibiting 1,176 specific consensus sequences protein kinases, used produce global analysis cellular kinase activity biopsies Barrett's esophagus, results compared neighboring cardia squamous epithelia. Several differences kinase activity using immunoblot analysis enzyme activity assays validated biopsies 27 Barrett's esophagus patients. Three unique kinome profiles described compared. identified cascades activated kinases showing mitogen-activated protein kinase epidermal growth factor receptor activity significantly altered Barrett's esophagus compared squamous gastric cardia epithelia. Another novel finding glycolysis pathway significantly up-regulated Barrett's esophagus, illustrated up-regulated pyruvate kinase activity. Here, unique kinome profile Barrett's esophagus made available comprehensive database. Several signaling pathways revealed specifically expressed Barrett's esophagus compared adjacent normal epithelia. unique findings provide novel insight pathogenesis Barrett's esophagus ultimately help resolve increasing problem Barrett's esophagus prevention esophageal adenocarcinoma.
