 Nitrate addition nitrate-limited cultures Selenastrum minutum Naeg. Collins (Chlorophyta) resulted 70% suppression photosynthetic carbon fixation. (14)CO(2) pulse/chase experiments nitrate resupply increased radiolabel incorporation amino organic acids decreased radiolabel incorporation insoluble material. Nitrate resupply increased concentration phosphoenolpyruvate increased radiolabeling phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, notably citrate, fumarate, malate. Furthermore, nitrate also increased pool sizes radiolabeling amino acids, alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine showing largest changes. Nitrate resupply increased proportion radiolabel C-4 position malate increased ratios radiolabel aspartate phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate, indicative increased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase activities. Analysis data showed rate carbon flow glutamate (10.6 mumoles glutamate per milligram chlorophyll per hour) rate net glutamate production (7.9 mumoles glutamate per milligram chlorophyll per hour) greater maximum rate carbon export Calvin cycle could maintained steady state photosynthesis. results consistent hypothesis nitrogen resupply nitrogen-limited microalgae results transient suppression photosynthetic carbon fixation due, part, severity competition carbon skeletons Calvin cycle nitrogen assimilation (IR Elrifi, DH Turpin 1986 Plant Physiol 81: 273-279).
