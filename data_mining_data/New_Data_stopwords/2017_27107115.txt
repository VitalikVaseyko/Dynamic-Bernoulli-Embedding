 UNLABELLED: Streptococcus thermophilus Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus used fermentation milk produce yoghurt. species normally metabolize glucose moiety lactose, secreting galactose producing lactic acid main metabolic end product. used multiple serial selection steps isolate spontaneous mutants industrial strains S. thermophilus L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus secreted glucose rather galactose utilizing lactose carbon source. Sequencing revealed S. thermophilus strains mutations galKTEM promoter, glucokinase gene, genes encoding elements glucose/mannose phosphotransferase system (PTS). strains metabolize galactose unable phosphorylate glucose internally via PTS. L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutants mutations genes glucose/mannose PTS pyruvate kinase gene. strains cannot grow exogenous glucose proficient metabolizing internal glucose released lactose beta-galactosidase. resulting strains combined ferment milk, producing yoghurt detectable lactose, moderate levels galactose, high levels glucose. Since glucose tastes considerably sweeter either lactose galactose, sweetness yoghurt perceptibly enhanced. strains produced without use recombinant DNA technology used industrial production yoghurt enhanced intrinsic sweetness low residual levels lactose. IMPORTANCE: Based good understanding physiology lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, able, selecting spontaneously occurring mutants, change dramatically metabolic products secreted growth medium. mutants consume substantially lactose, metabolize galactose, secrete remaining galactose glucose back milk. allows production yoghurt low lactose levels enhanced natural sweetness, humans perceive glucose sweeter either lactose galactose.
