 transforming protein Rous sarcoma virus, pp60v-src, covalently coupled myristic acid amide linkage glycine 2. Myristylation promotes association pp60v-src cellular membranes, subcellular location essential transforming activity. findings presented here, conjunction previous reports others, imply seventh amino acid encoded v-src might important myristylation reaction. Replacement lysine 7 asparagine greatly reduced myristylation, membrane association, transforming activity pp60v-src. contrast, substitution arginine residue 7 effect properties pp60v-src. Addition amino acids 1 7 encoded v-src sufficient cause myristylation src-pyruvate kinase fusion protein. conclude recognition sequence myristylation pp60v-src comprises amino acids 1 7 lysine 7 critical component sequence.
