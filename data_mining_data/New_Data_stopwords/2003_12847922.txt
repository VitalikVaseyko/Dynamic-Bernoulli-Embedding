 Little progress made treatment African trypanosomiasis past decades. L-carnitine major role glycolysis-based energy supply blood trypanosomes stimulates constant ATP production. investigate whether administration isomer D-carnitine could exert competitive inhibition metabolic pathway L-form, possibly resulting parasite replication inhibition, several formulations compound tested Trypanosoma lewisi T. brucei rhodesiense rodent models. High oral dosages D-cornitine inner salt proprionyl-D-carnitine toxic animals induced 50% parasite growth inhibition reversible, i.e. competitive, fashion. putative mechanism could interference pyruvate kinase activity hence ATP production. Considering both, lack toxicity inhibitory activity, D-carnitine may role treatment African trypanosomiasis, association available trypanocidal drugs.
