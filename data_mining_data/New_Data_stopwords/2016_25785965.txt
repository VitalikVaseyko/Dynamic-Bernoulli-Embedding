 Adiponectin deficiency leads increased myocardial infarct size following ischemia reperfusion exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy following pressure overload, entities causally linked mitochondrial dysfunction. skeletal muscle, lack adiponectin results impaired mitochondrial function. Thus, objective investigate whether adiponectin deficiency impairs mitochondrial energetics heart. 8 weeks age, heart weight-to-body weight ratios different adiponectin knockout (ADQ-/-) mice wildtypes (WT). isolated working hearts, cardiac output, aortic developed pressure cardiac power preserved ADQ-/- mice. Rates fatty acid oxidation, glucose oxidation glycolysis unchanged groups. myocardial oxygen consumption slightly reduced (-24%) ADQ-/- mice isolated working hearts, rates maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial oxygen consumption ATP synthesis saponin-permeabilized cardiac fibers preserved ADQ-/- mice glutamate, pyruvate palmitoyl-carnitine substrate. addition, enzymatic activity respiratory complexes II unchanged groups. Phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase SIRT1 activity decreased, expression acetylation PGC-1alpha unchanged, mitochondrial content OXPHOS subunits decreased ADQ-/- mice. Finally, increasing energy demands due prolonged subcutaneous infusion isoproterenol differentially affect cardiac contractility mitochondrial function ADQ-/- mice compared WT. Thus, mitochondrial contractile function preserved hearts mice lacking adiponectin, suggesting adiponectin may expendable regulation mitochondrial energetics contractile function heart non-pathological conditions.
