 BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES: Gastric cancers usually characterized using Lauren's classification intestinal diffuse types. previously documented down-modulation miR31, miR148a, miR204, miR375 gastric cancers. aimed manuscript investigate miRs end-points diagnosis, Lauren's classification prognosis. METHODS: total 117 resected non-cardial adenocarcinomas evaluated miRs' expressions. performance miRs' expressions cancer diagnosis tested using ROC curves. Logistic regression conducted end-point Lauren's classification. Kaplan-Meier Cox analyses performed OS, DFS, DSS. miRs' targets reviewed using PRISMA method BCL-2 investigated cell lines. RESULTS: ROC curves documented miRs' down-modulation significant differentiating cancer versus normal tissues. Diffuse type cancers associated female sex, young age, miR375 higher expression. confirmed BCL-2 miR204 target. However, survival analyses confirmed pathologic criteria (advanced stages, LNR, low LNH) significant variables correlated worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: down-modulation miR31, miR148a, miR204, miR375 significantly associated non-cardial gastric cancers miR375 specifically linked Lauren's classification. Nevertheless, standard pathological features display independent variables associated worse prognosis.
