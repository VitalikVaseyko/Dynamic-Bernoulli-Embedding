 effect ascent moderate altitude (2,300 m) altitude training O2-transport properties Hb possible consequences tissue oxygenation exercise studied six control six training subjects. rapid increase P-50 values (+2.4 mm Hg, 0.32 kPa) measured within one day ascent. end stay altitude (13th day) P-50 values higher subjects performing training controls. altitude slow constant increase 2,3-DPG, pyruvate kinase activity reticulocyte count found, pronounced training subjects compared controls. Ascent altitude resulted decreased maximal performance capacity (-9%), groups recovered stay. training subjects maximal exercise performance increased descent. Exercise altitude performed lower heart rate (controls: -10/min; training: -18/min) lower lactate concentration (-4 mmol/l). data indicate positive effect adaptation altitude exercise performance. Training shifts ODC right adds effect effects passive altitude adaptation O2-binding properties hemoglobin.
