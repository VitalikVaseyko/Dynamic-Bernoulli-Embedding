 Metabolic adaptation increasingly recognized key factor tumor progression, yet involvement metastatic bone disease understood. Bone adipocyte-rich organ, major site metastasis prostate cancer. Bone marrow adipocytes metabolically active cells capable shaping tumor metabolism via lipolysis lipid transfer. study, using vitro vivo models marrow adiposity, demonstrate marrow fat cells promote Warburg phenotype metastatic prostate cancer cells. show increased expression glycolytic enzymes, increased lactate production, decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation tumor cells exposed adipocytes require paracrine signaling two cell types. also reveal prostate cancer cells capable inducing adipocyte lipolysis postulated mechanism sustenance. provide evidence adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming tumor cells via oxygen-independent mechanism HIF-1alpha activation reversed HIF-1alpha downregulation. Importantly, also demonstrate observed metabolic signature tumor cells exposed adipocytes mimics expression patterns seen patients metastatic disease. Together, data provide evidence functional relationship marrow adipocytes tumor cells bone likely implications tumor growth survival within metastatic niche.
