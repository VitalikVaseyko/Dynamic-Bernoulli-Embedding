 Molecular abnormalities erythroenzymopathies associated hereditary hemolytic anemia determined means molecular biology. Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency common well-characterized enzyme deficiency glycolytic pathway, causes hereditary hemolytic anemia. date, 47 gene mutations identified. identified one base deletion, one splicing mutation, six distinct missense mutations 12 unrelated families homozygous PK deficiency. Mutations located near substrate fructose-1,6- diphosphate binding site may change conformation active site, resulting drastic loss activity severe clinical symptoms. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)deficiency common metabolic disorder, associated chronic hemolytic anemia and/or drug- infection-induced acute hemolytic attack. estimated 400 million people affected worldwide. mutations responsible 78 variants determined. polymorphic frequencies different populations. variants produced one two nucleotide substitutions. Molecular studies disclosed class 1 G6PD variants associated chronic hemolysis mutations surrounding either substrate NADP binding site. Among rare enzymopathies, missense mutations determined deficiencies glucosephosphate isomerase, (TPI), phosphoglycerate kinase, adenylate kinase. Compound heterozygosity missense mutation base deletion determined deficiencies hexokinase diphosphoglyceromutase. Compound heterozygosity missense nonsense mutations identified TPI deficiency. One base junction mutations resulting abnormally spliced PFK-M mRNA identified homozygous PFK deficiency. exception hemolytic anemia due increased adenosine deaminase activity. basic abnormality appears result overproduction structurally normal enzyme.
