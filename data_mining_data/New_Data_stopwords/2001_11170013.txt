 shallow marine teleost fishes, osmolyte trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) typically found <70 mmol/kg wet weight. Recently found deep-sea teleosts 288 mmol/kg, increasing order shallow < bathyal < abyssal. hypothesized protein stabilizer counteracts inhibition proteins hydrostatic pressure, showed that, lactate dehydrogenases (LDH), 250 mM TMAO fully offset increase NADH K(m) physiological pressure, partly reversed pressure-enhanced losses activity supranormal pressures. study, examined effects pressure TMAO proteins teleosts live 2000-5000 (200-500 atmospheres [atm]). First, LDH grenadier (Coryphaenoides leptolepis) 500 atm 8 hr, significant 15% loss activity (P < 0.05 relative 1 atm control) reduced 250 mM TMAO insignificant loss. Second, pyruvate kinase morid cod (Antimora microlepis) 200 atm, 73% increase ADP K(m) without TMAO (P < 0.01 relative K(m) 1 atm) 29% increase 300 mM TMAO. Third, G-actin grenadier (C. armatus) 500 atm 16 hr, significant reduction F-actin polymerization (P < 0.01 compared polymerization 1 atm) fully counteracted 250 mM TMAO, unchanged 250 mM glycine. findings support hypothesis.
