 Corynebacterium glutamicum become favourite model organism white biotechnology. Nevertheless, systems regulatable (over)expression homologous heterologous genes currently available, based endogenous RNA polymerase. study, developed isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG)-inducible T7 expression system prophage-free strain C. glutamicum MB001. purpose, part DE3 region Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) including T7 RNA polymerase gene 1 control lacUV5 promoter integrated chromosome, resulting strain MB001(DE3). Furthermore, expression vector pMKEx2 constructed allowing cloning target genes control T7lac promoter. properties system evaluated using eyfp heterologous target gene. Without induction, system tightly repressed, resulting low specific eYFP fluorescence (= fluorescence per cell density). maximal induction IPTG, specific fluorescence increased 450-fold compared uninduced state 3.5 times higher control strains expressing eyfp control IPTG-induced tac promoter endogenous RNA polymerase. Flow cytometry revealed T7-based eyfp expression resulted highly uniform population, 99% cells showing high fluorescence. Besides eyfp, functionality corynebacterial T7 expression system also successfully demonstrated overexpression C. glutamicum pyk gene pyruvate kinase, led increase specific activity 2.6 135 U mg(-1). thus presents efficient new tool protein overproduction, metabolic engineering synthetic biology approaches C. glutamicum.
