 Novel antimicrobial targets urgently needed overcome rising antibiotic resistance important human pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). report essentiality kinetic properties MRSA pyruvate kinase (PK). Targetron-mediated gene disruption demonstrated PK essential S. aureus growth survival, suggesting protein may potential drug target. presence pfk (6-phosphofructokinase)-pyk operon MRSA252, nonessential nature PFK shown targetron, emphasized essential role PK cell viability. importance PK bacterial growth confirmed showing enzymatic activity peaked logarithmic phase S. aureus growth. PK Staphylococcus several species bacteria extra C-terminal domain (CT) containing phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding motif. elucidate possible structure function sequence, quaternary structures kinetic properties full-length MRSA PK truncated MRSA PK lacking CT domain characterized. results showed (1) MRSA PK allosteric enzyme homotetramer architecture activated AMP ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), suggests different mode allosteric regulation compared human isozymes, (2) CT domain required tetramerization enzyme; homotetramerization occurred truncated PK lacking domain, (3) truncated enzyme exhibited high affinity toward PEP ADP exhibited hyperbolic kinetics toward PEP presence activators (AMP R5P) consistent kinetic properties full-length enzyme, indicating CT domain required substrate binding allosteric regulation observed holoenzyme, (4) kinetic efficiency (k(cat)/S(0.5)) truncated enzyme decreased 24- 16-fold, ligand-free state, toward PEP ADP, respectively, restored 3-fold AMP-bound state, suggesting sequence containing CT domain (Gly(473)-Leu(585)) plays substantial role enzyme activity comformational stability, (5) full-length MRSA PK activity stimulated low concentrations ATP (e.g., 1 mM) inhibited inorganic phosphate high concentrations FBP (10 mM) ATP (e.g., >2.5 mM), whereas truncated enzyme, stimulation low concentrations ATP lost. findings suggest CT domain involved maintaining specificity allosteric regulation MRSA PK AMP, R5P, ATP. CT extension also encodes protein domain homology enzyme Escherichia coli sugar-PTS system, suggesting MRSA PK may also exert important regulatory role sugar transport metabolism. findings yield new insights MRSA PK function mode allosteric regulation may aid development clinically important drugs targeting enzyme define role extra C-terminal domain modulating enzyme's activity.
