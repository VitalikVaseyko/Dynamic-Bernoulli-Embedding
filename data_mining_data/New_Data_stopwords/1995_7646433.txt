 variant form yeast pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) Ser-384 mutated proline engineered order study allosteric properties enzyme. mutant wild-type enzymes overexpressed strain yeast genomic copy pyruvate kinase gene disrupted insertion Ura3 gene. enzymes purified homogeneity kinetic properties characterized. wild-type enzyme displays sigmoid kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentration, activated allosteric effect fructose 1,6-bisphosphate concomitant reduction co-operativity. contrast, mutant found dependent presence effector catalytic activity inactive absence. fully activated mutant enzyme kcat. 1.6 times greater wild-type enzyme. mutation introduced enzyme intersubunit contact known critical allosteric properties enzyme, far removed active site. major effect mutation seems stabilize low-affinity state apoenzyme, although kcat. also affected. S0.5 PEP S0.5 ADP wild-type enzyme 0.22 +/- 0.004 0.15 +/- 0.01 mM respectively (means +/- S.E.M.). activated mutant enzyme, kinetic parameters increased 0.67 +/- 0.03 0.43 +/- 0.03 mM respectively. cooperativity ADP-binding sites altered mutant enzyme, Hill coefficient (h) ADP increasing 1.65 +/- 0.07 presence effector, compared value 0.01 +/- 0.07 wild-type enzyme conditions. CD spectroscopy revealed secondary structure mutant enzyme little different wild-type enzyme, indicating two enzymes similar secondary structures solution. Precise tertiary quaternary structures intersubunit interdomain interactions may modified. improved purification procedure devised allows large quantities enzyme rapidly prepared.
