 properties Na+-dependent L-alanine transport human erythrocytes investigated using K+ Na+ substitute. Initial rates Na+-dependent L-alanine uptake (0.2 mM extracellular amino acid) erythrocytes 22 donors ranged 40 180 mumol/litre cells per h 37 degrees C. Amino acid uptake concentration range 0.1-8 mM consistent single saturable component Na+-dependent L-alanine transport. Apparent Km Vmax. values 37 5 degrees C measured erythrocytes donor 0.27 0.085 mM respectively, 270 8.5 mumol/litre cells per h respectively. transporter responsible uptake identified system ASC basis cross-inhibition studies series 42 amino acids amino acid analogues. Apparent Ki values glycine, L-alpha-amino-n-butyrate, L-serine L-leucine inhibitors Na+-dependent L-alanine uptake 37 degrees C 4.2, 0.12, 0.16 0.70 mM respectively. Reticulocytes patient inherited pyruvate kinase deficiency found 10-fold elevated activity Na+-dependent L-alanine uptake compared erythrocytes normal donors. Separation erythrocytes according cell density (cell age) established even oldest mature erythrocytes retained significant Na+-dependent L-alanine transport activity. Amino acid transport was, however, sensitive indicator cell age acetylcholinesterase activity. Erythrocytes found accumulate L-alanine concentration gradient (distribution ratio approx. 1.5 4 h incubation), effect abolished Na+-free media. Na+-dependent L-alanine uptake shown associated L-alanine-dependent Na+ influx, measured coupling ratio 1:1.
