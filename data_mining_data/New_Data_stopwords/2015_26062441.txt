 Reprogramming metabolism tumor cells hallmark cancer. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) frequently overexpressed tumor cells. Previous studies shown higher levels LDHA related colorectal cancer (CRC), role tumor maintenance underlying molecular mechanisms established. Here, investigated miRNAs-induced changes LDHA expression. reported colorectal cancer express higher levels LDHA compared adjacent normal tissue. Knockdown LDHA resulted decreased lactate ATP production, glucose uptake. Colorectal cancer cells knockdown LDHA much slower growth rate control cells. Furthermore, found miR-34a, miR-34c, miR-369-3p, miR-374a, miR-4524a/b target LDHA regulate glycolysis cancer cells. negative correlation miRNAs LDHA expression colorectal cancer tissues. importantly, identified genetic loci newly associated increased colorectal cancer progression, rs18407893 11p15.4 (in 3'-UTR LDHA), maps seed sequence recognized miR-374a. Cancer cells overexpressed miR-374a decreased levels LDHA compared miR-374a-MUT (rs18407893 11p15.4). Taken together, novel findings provide therapeutic approaches Warburg effect therapeutic targets cancer energy metabolism.
