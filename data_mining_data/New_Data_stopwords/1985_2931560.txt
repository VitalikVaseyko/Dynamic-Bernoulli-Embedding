 Past work, including computer simulation cardiac energy metabolism, indicates magnesium important coherent controller glycolysis Krebs cycle. Many glycolytic enzymes sensitive Mg2+. important effect due MgATP2-being cofactor number enzymes chelation forms inactive inhibitory. means Mg2+ Mg2+ chelates adenine nucleotides regulate important glycolytic enzymes--hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase--are described detail. Creatine kinase, important energy metabolism highly sensitive metal ions pH, also discussed. necessary properly control composition assay mixtures (particularly regard metal ions) order determine actually regulates activity enzyme.
