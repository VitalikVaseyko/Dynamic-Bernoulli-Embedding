 p53 gene essential tumor suppression, remains unclear. Upon genotoxic oncogenic stresses, increased p53 activity induces transient cell cycle arrest, senescence apoptosis, three cornerstones so-called triumvirate. Accordingly, long thought p53 suppresses tumorigenesis somehow counteracting cell proliferation survival. However, several recently described genetically modified mice indicate p53 suppress tumorigenesis without triggering three responses. Rather, important mechanism tumor suppression, mutant mice point ability p53 prevent Warburg effect, dampen glycolysis foster mitochondrial respiration. Interestingly, metabolic functions p53 rely, part, "unstressed" (basal) expression, feature shared mechanistically linked anti-oxydant function. Together, "conservative" activities p53 may prevent tumor initiation promoting maintaining normal oxidative metabolism hence underly "daily" tumor suppression p53 cells. Conversely, destructive activities elicited high p53 levels leading senescence apoptosis provide shield partially overtly transformed cells. last situation, although relatively infrequent throughout life, usual experimental settings, could explain disproportionally high number data implicating triumvirate tumor suppression p53.
