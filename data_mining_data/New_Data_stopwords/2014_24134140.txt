 protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma) undergoes multistep activation participates various cellular processes Purkinje cells. Perturbations phosphorylation state, conformation localization disrupt kinase signalling, spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) caused missense mutations PRKCG encoding PKCgamma. previously showed SCA14 mutations enhance PKCgamma membrane translocation upon stimulation owing altered protein conformation. faster translocation result increased function, examined SCA14 mutations induce altered conformation PKCgamma consequences conformational change PKCgamma life cycle. Here, show SCA14-related PKCgamma-V138E exhibits exposed C-terminus shown fluorescence resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy living cells, indicative partial unfolding. conformational change associated faster phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced translocation accumulation fully phosphorylated PKCgamma insoluble fraction, could rescued coexpressing PDK1 kinase normally triggers PKCgamma autophosphorylation. propose SCA14 mutation V138E causes unfolding C1B domain exposure C-terminus PKCgamma-V138E molecule, resulting decrease functional kinase soluble fraction. Here, show mutation V138E protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma) C1B domain (PKCgamma-V138E), implicated spinocerebellar ataxia type 14, exhibits partially unfolded C-terminus. leads unusually fast phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced membrane translocation accumulation phosphorylated PKCgamma-V138E insoluble fraction, causing loss functional kinase. contrast general chaperones, coexpression PKCgamma's 'natural chaperone', PDK1 kinase, could rescue PKCgamma-V138E phenotype.
