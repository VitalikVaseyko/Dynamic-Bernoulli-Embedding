 Hibernating bears survive 6 months without feeding utilizing stored body fat fuel. investigate bears maintain energy homeostasis hibernation, analyzed changes mRNA expression hepatic genes involved energy metabolism throughout hibernation period captive, adult, female Japanese black bears (Ursus thibetanus japonicus). Real-time PCR analysis revealed down-regulation glycolysis- (e.g., glucokinase), amino acid catabolism- (e.g., alanine aminotransferase) de novo lipogenesis-related genes (e.g., acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1), up-regulation gluconeogensis- (e.g., pyruvate carboxylase), beta-oxidation- (i.e., uncoupling protein 2) ketogenesis-related genes (i.e., 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA synthase 2), hibernation, compared active period (June). addition, found glycolysis-related genes (i.e., glucokinase pyruvate kinase) suppressed early phase hibernation (January) compared late phase (March). One week commencement feeding April, expression levels genes returned levels comparable seen June, beta-oxidation-related genes still up-regulated period. results suggest modulation gene expression static, changes throughout hibernation period. transcriptional modulation hibernation represents unique physiological adaptation prolonged fasting bears.
