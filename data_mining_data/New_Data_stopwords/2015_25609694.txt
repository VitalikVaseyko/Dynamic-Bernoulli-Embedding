 NF-kappaB found almost animal cell types involved myriad cellular responses. Aberrant expression NF-kappaB linked cancer, inflammatory diseases improper development. Little known transcriptional regulation NF-kappaB family member gene RelA/p65. Sp1 plays key role expression RelA/p65 gene. ZBTB2 represses transcription gene inhibiting Sp1 binding Sp1-binding GC-box RelA/p65 proximal promoter (bp, -31 -21). Moreover, recent studies revealed RelA/p65 directly binds peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator1alpha (PGC1alpha) decrease transcriptional activation PGC1alpha target gene PDK4, whose gene product inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), key regulator TCA cycle flux. Accordingly, observed RelA/p65 repression ZBTB2 indirectly results increased PDK4 expression, inhibits PDH. Consequently, cells ectopic ZBTB2, concentrations pyruvate lactate higher normal cells, indicating changes glucose metabolism flux favoring glycolysis TCA cycle. Knockdown ZBTB2 mouse xenografts decreased tumor growth. ZBTB2 may increase cell proliferation reprogramming glucose metabolic pathways favor glycolysis upregulating PDK4 expression via repression RelA/p65 expression.
