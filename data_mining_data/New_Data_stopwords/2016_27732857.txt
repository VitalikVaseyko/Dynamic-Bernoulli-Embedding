 Metabolic reprogramming critical oncogenesis, emergence function profound reorganization remain poorly understood. find cooperating oncogenic mutations drive large-scale metabolic reprogramming, intrinsic cancer cells obligatory transition malignancy. involves synergistic regulation several genes encoding metabolic enzymes, including lactate dehydrogenases LDHA LDHB mitochondrial glutamic pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2). Notably, GPT2 engages activated glycolysis drive utilization glutamine carbon source TCA cycle anaplerosis colon cancer cells. data indicate Warburg effect supports oncogenesis via GPT2-mediated coupling pyruvate production glutamine catabolism. Although critical cancer phenotype, GPT2 activity dispensable cells fully transformed, thus pinpointing metabolic vulnerability specifically associated cancer cell progression malignancy.
