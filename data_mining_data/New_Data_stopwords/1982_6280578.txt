 order evaluate properly red cell metabolic data obtained newborns congenital hemolytic disorders, unique metabolic characteristics normal developmental changes occur prenatally postnatally presented. age-dependent red cell glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glycolytic intermediates elevated birth 11 12 months age, consistent presence young red cell population entire first year life. However, certain red cell enzymes elevated proportion age red cell population [phosphoglucose isomerase. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), enolase (ENO)] whereas others decreased [phosphofructokinase (PFK), glutathione peroxidase, carbonic anhydrase, others]. metabolic characteristics felt unique representative "fetal erythropoiesis." Activities PGK ENO decrease PFK increases toward normal adult values beginning eight nine weeks age. concentration glucose-6-phosphate steadily increases birth peaks three four weeks age, time PFK activity remains relatively unchanged, suggesting relative block glycolysis PFK step secondary enzyme decreased activity altered kinetic properties (a "fetal" isozyme). Thus, evaluation red cell enzyme glycolytic intermediate data obtained first year life related knowledge young red cell population present characteristic unique metabolic red cell alterations described cord blood persist beyond immediate neonatal period.
