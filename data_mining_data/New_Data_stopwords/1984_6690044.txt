 fetal liver isozymes aldolase pyruvate kinase K increase livers adult rats fed choline deficient-diet containing 0.1% ethionine. Oval cells isolated centrifugal elutriation preneoplastic livers animals receiving carcinogenic diet contained fetal forms well fetal-adult isozyme hybrids. contrast, parenchymal cells isolated livers animals aldolase B pyruvate kinase L, isozymes present parenchymal cells normal adult rats. Liver homogenates rats receiving carcinogenic diet contain lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1, LDH 2, LDH 3 addition LDH 4 LDH 5, forms detected normal liver homogenates. LDH 1, LDH 2, LDH 3 present oval cells preneoplastic livers biliary epithelial cells normal livers, parenchymal cells isolated normal preneoplastic livers. Cells biliary epithelium normal livers also contain aldolase pyruvate kinase K, fetal-adult isozymes present oval cell populations. results indicate that, animals receiving carcinogenic diet, isozyme alterations associated neoplasia result proliferation new cell population contains enzymes "dedifferentiation" mature hepatocytes. Furthermore, data suggest new cell population may include liver stem cell compartment containing cells transitional states differentiation.
