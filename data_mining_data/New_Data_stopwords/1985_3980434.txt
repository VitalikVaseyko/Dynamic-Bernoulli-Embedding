 Enzymes glucose metabolism assayed crude cell extracts Frankia strains HFPArI3 HFPCcI2 well isolated vesicle clusters Alnus rubra root nodules. Activities Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway enzymes glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase found Frankia strain HFPArI3 glucokinase pyruvate kinase found Frankia strain HFPCcI2 vesicle clusters. NADP+-linked glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase NAD-linked 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase found extracts, although role enzymes unclear. NADP+-linked 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase found. dehydrogenases inhibited adenosine 5-triphosphate, apparent Km's glucose 6-phosphate 6-phosphogluconate 6.86 X 10(-4) 7.0 X 10(-5) M, respectively. addition enzymes mentioned above, NADP+-linked malic enzyme detected pure cultures vesicle clusters. contrast, however, vesicle clusters activity NAD-linked malic enzyme. possibility enzyme resulted contamination plant mitochondria trapped vesicle clusters could discounted. None extracts showed activities Entner-Doudoroff enzymes gluconate metabolism enzymes gluconate dehydrogenase gluconokinase. Propionate- versus trehalose-grown cultures strain HFPArI3 showed similar activities enzymes except malic enzyme, higher cultures grown organic acid. Nitrogen-fixing cultures strain HFPArI3 showed higher specific activities glucose 6-phosphate 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases phosphofructokinase ammonia-grown cultures.
