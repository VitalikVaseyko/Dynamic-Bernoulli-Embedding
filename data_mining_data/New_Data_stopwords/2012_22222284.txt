 pathogenesis SARS-CoV remains largely unknown. study function SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, conducted yeast two-hybrid screening experiment identify cellular proteins may interact SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. Pyruvate kinase (liver) found interact SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein experiment. binding domains two proteins also determined using yeast two-hybrid system. physical interaction SARS-CoV nucleocapsid cellular pyruvate kinase (liver) proteins confirmed GST pull-down assay, co-immunoprecipitation assay confocal microscopy. Cellular pyruvate kinase activity hepatoma cells repressed SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein either transiently transfected stably transfected cells. PK deficiency red blood cells known result human hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. reasonable assume inhibition PKL activity due interaction SARS-CoV N protein likely cause death hepatocytes, results elevation serum alanine aminotransferase liver dysfunction noted SARS patients. Thus, results suggest SARS-CoV could reduce pyruvate kinase activity via nucleocapsid protein, may turn cause disease.
