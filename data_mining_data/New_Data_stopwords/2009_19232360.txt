 model proposed links together two approaches describe tumours: continuous medium describe movement mechanical properties tissue, population dynamics approach represent internal genetic inhomogeneity instability tumour. way one build models cover several stages tumour progression. paper focus describing transition aerobic purely glycolytic metabolism (the Warburg effect) tumour cords. mathematical point view model leads free boundary problem domains contact characterized different sets equations. Accurate stitching solution possible modified ghost fluid method. Growth death cells uptake nutrients related ATP production energy costs cellular processes. framework bi-population model allowed keep number model parameters relatively small.
