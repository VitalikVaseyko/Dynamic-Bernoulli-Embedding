 Modification ethanol productivity yield, using mineral medium supplemented glucose xylose carbon sources, studied ethanologenic Escherichia coli KO11 increasing activity five key carbon metabolism enzymes. KO11 efficiently converted glucose xylose ethanol yield close 100% theoretical maximum growing rich medium. However, KO11 ferments glucose xylose mineral medium, ethanol yields decreased 70 60%, respectively. increase GALP(Ec) (permease galactose-glucose-xylose) PGK(Ec) (phosphoglycerate kinase) activities change xylose glucose ethanol flux. However, PDC(Zm) (pyruvate decarboxylase Zymomonas mobilis) activity increased 7-fold, yields ethanol glucose xylose increased 85 75%, respectively, organic acid formation rates reduced. Furthermore, response reduction acetate ATP yield, limited PDC(Zm) activity, increase PFK(Ec) (phosphofructokinase) PYK(Bs) (pyruvate kinase Bacillus stearothermophilus) activity drastically reduced glucose xylose consumption ethanol formation flux. experimental metabolic control analysis showed ethanol flux KO11 negatively controlled phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, positively influenced PDC(Zm) activity level.
