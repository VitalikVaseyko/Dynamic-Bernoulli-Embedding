 wide specificity 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) towards nucleotide substrate property allows contribution enzyme effective phosphorylation (i.e. activation) nucleotide-based pro-drugs HIV. Here, structural basis nucleotide-PGK interaction characterised comparison kinases, namely pyruvate kinase (PK) creatine kinase (CK), enzyme kinetic analysis structural modelling (docking) studies. results provided evidence favouring purine vs. pyrimidine base containing nucleotides PGK rather PK CK. due exceptional ability PGK forming hydrophobic contacts nucleotide rings assures appropriate positioning connected phosphate-chain catalysis. D-/L-configurations nucleotides, L-forms (both purine pyrimidine) well accepted PGK rather either PK CK. dominance hydrophobic interactions L-form pyrimidines PGK underlined comparison PK CK. Furthermore, l-forms, absence ribose OH-groups PGK better tolerated purine pyrimidine containing compounds. hand, positioning phosphate-chain even important term PGK case purines pyrimidines L-configuration, deduced present kinetic studies various nucleotide-site mutants PGK. characteristics kinase-nucleotide interactions provide guideline designing new drugs.
