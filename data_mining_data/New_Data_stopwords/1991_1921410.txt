 bioassay measurement platelet-activating factor (PAF) based quantification platelet aggregation developed. method used platelet analyzer conjunction multiwelled micromixing device whole blood collected male New Zealand White rabbits. bioassay nonselective used quantitate platelet aggregation induced activator. EC50 platelet-activating factor, arachidonic acid, adenosine diphosphate 0.0232, 55, 10 microM, concentrations half maximal aggregation response occurred 7.5, 10.0, 12.5 min, respectively. bioassay capable sensitive quantification platelet aggregation small volumes (50 microL) citrated rabbit whole blood, using short (i.e., 15-min) incubation period. enabled multiple bioassays performed without need large volume whole blood collected rabbit. Selective measurement platelet-activating factor achieved adding inhibitors arachidonic acid- adenosine diphosphate-dependent pathways platelet activation, is, acetylsalicyclic acid phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase, respectively, citrated rabbit whole blood immediately bioassay. inhibited arachidonic acid- adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation, effect platelet aggregation induced platelet-activating factor. Platelet-activating factor selectively inhibited receptor antagonist BN 52021. method measuring platelet-activating factor reproducible; EC50, inter- intrabioassay coefficients variation within acceptable limits 13.17% 9.75%, respectively.
