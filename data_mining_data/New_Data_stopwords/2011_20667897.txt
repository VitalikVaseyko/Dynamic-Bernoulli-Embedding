 Emerging studies identified microRNAs (miRNAs) possible therapeutic tools treatment glioma, aggressive brain tumor. important targets tumor well understood. recently found Notch pathway target miRNA-326. Ectopic expression miRNA-326 glioma glioma stem cells induced apoptosis reduced metabolic activity. Computational target gene prediction revealed pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) another target miRNA-326. PKM2 recently shown play key role cancer cell metabolism. investigate whether might functionally important target miR-326, used RNA interference knockdown PKM2 expression glioma cells. Transfection established glioma glioma stem cells PKM2 siRNA reduced growth, cellular invasion, metabolic activity, ATP glutathione levels, activated AMP-activated protein kinase. cytotoxic effects exhibited PKM2 knockdown glioma glioma stem cells observed transformed human astrocytes. Western blot analysis human glioblastoma specimens showed high levels PKM2 protein, none observed normal brain samples. Strikingly, cells high levels PKM2 expressed lower levels miR-326, suggestive endogenous regulation PKM2 miR-326. data suggest PKM2 inhibition therapy glioblastoma, potential minimal toxicity brain.
