 AIMS: presence oxygen, synthesized pyruvate glycolysis cancer cell solid tumors released away mitochondria form lactate (Warburg Effect). maintain cell homeostasis, lactate transported across cell membrane monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). major aim current investigation identify novel compounds inhibit lactate efflux may lead identifying effective targets cancer treatment. STUDY DESIGN: study, 900 ethanol plant extracts screened lactate efflux inhibition using neuroblastoma (N2-A) cell line. Additionally, investigated mechanism inhibition potent plant extract regarding monocarboxylate transporters expression, consequences effects viability, growth, apoptosis. METHODOLOGY: potency lactate efflux inhibition ethanol plant extracts evaluated N2-A cells measuring extracellular lactate levels. Caspase 3- activity acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining performed assess apoptotic effect. antiproliferative effect measured using WST assay. Western blotting performed quantify protein expression MCTs chaperone CD147 treated cells lysates. RESULTS: Terminalia chebula plant extract potent lactate efflux inhibitor N2-A cells among 900 - tested plant extracts. results obtained show extract Terminalia chebula fruits (TCE) significantly (P = 0.05) reduced expression MCT1, MCT3, MCT4 chaperone CD147. plant extract potent (IC50 3.59 +/- 0.26 mug/ml) MCT standard inhibitor phloretin (IC50 76.54 +/- 3.19 mug/ml). extract also showed potency selective cytotoxicity cancer cells DI-TNC1 primary cell line (IC50 7.37 +/- 0.28 vs. 17.35 +/- 0.19 mug/ml). Moreover, TCE Inhibited N2-A cell growth (IG50 = 5.20 +/- 0.30 mug/ml) induced apoptosis 7.5 mug/ml concentration. CONCLUSION: 900 plant extracts screened, Terminalia chebula ethanol extract found potent lactate efflux inhibitor ability inhibit chaperone CD147 expression impact function monocarboxylate transporters. Furthermore, TCE found growth inhibition apoptotic effects. results obtained indicate Terminalia chebula constituent(s) may contain promising compounds useful management neuroblastoma cancer.
