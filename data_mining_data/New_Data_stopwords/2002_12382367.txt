 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency common cause hereditary non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia. autosomal recessive disorder caused mutations gene coding erythrocyte liver-type pyruvate kinase (PKLR). far, 130 mutations gene identified. Clinical symptoms, usually restricted homozygous compound-heterozygous individuals, variable, ranging neonatal jaundice requiring erythrocyte transfusions fully compensated haemolytic anaemia. exact mechanism erythrocyte destruction unknown, however adenosine-triphosphate depletion increase 2,3-disphosphoglycerate thought important. diagnosis pyruvate kinase deficiency depends upon demonstration low PK enzyme activity. Due pitfalls determining true PK activity, DNA testing valuable tool diagnosis pyruvate kinase deficiency. centralizing molecular diagnostics pyruvate kinase deficiency Utrecht, care provided diagnosis, treatment support patients.
