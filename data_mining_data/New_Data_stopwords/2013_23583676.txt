 Aerobic glycolysis, preferential use glycolysis even presence oxygen meet cellular metabolic demands, near universal feature cancer. unique type metabolism thought protect cancer cells damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced mitochondria. Using cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 shown shRNA mediated knockdown lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), key mediator aerobic glycolysis, results elevated mitochondrial ROS production concomitant decrease cell proliferation motility. Redox-sensitive proteins affected oxidative stress associated LDHA knockdown identified Redox 2D-PAGE mass spectrometry. particular, tropomyosin (Tm) isoforms Tm4, Tm5NM1 Tm5NM5, proteins involved cell migration cytoskeletal dynamics, exhibited changes disulfide bonding co-localized peri-nuclear actin aggregates LDHA knockdown cells. contrast, treatment thiol-based antioxidant N-acetylcysteine promoted relocalization Tms cortical actin microfilaments partially rescued migration defects associated attenuated LDHA expression. results suggest aerobic glycolysis reduced mitochondrial ROS production create environment conducive cytoskeletal remodeling; key events linked high cell motility associated cancer.
