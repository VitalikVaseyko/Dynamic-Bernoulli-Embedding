 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progresses chronic phase blast crisis, levels BCR-ABL increase. addition, blast-transformed leukemic cells display enhanced resistance imatinib absence BCR-ABL-resistance mutations. study, show BCR-ABL-transformed cell lines selected imatinib resistance vitro, cells grew displayed higher BCR-ABL expression comparable increase seen accelerated forms disease. enhanced expression BCR-ABL associated increased rate glycolysis decreased rate proliferation. higher level BCR-ABL expression selected cells correlated nonhypoxic induction hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) required cells tolerate enhanced BCR-ABL signaling. HIF-1alpha induction resulted enhanced rate glycolysis reduced glucose flux tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidative arm pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). reduction oxidative PPP-mediated ribose synthesis compensated HIF-1alpha-dependent activation nonoxidative PPP enzyme, transketolase, imatinib-resistant CML cells. primary cultures cells patients exhibiting blast transformation vivo xenograft tumors, use oxythiamine, inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex transketolase, resulted enhanced imatinib sensitivity tumor cells. Together, results suggest oxythiamine enhance imatinib efficacy patients present accelerated form disease.
