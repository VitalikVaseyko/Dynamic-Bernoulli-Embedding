 activities enzymes related energy metabolism gastrocnemius soleus muscles young-adult (4 months), mature (12 months), senescent (24 months) rats compared continuous (72 consecutive h) exposure normobaric hypoxia normoxia vasodilator naftidrofuryl saline solution given intraperitoneally 30 consecutive days. maximum rats (Vmax) following enzyme activities crude extract and/or crude mitochondrial fraction muscle specimen evaluated for: anaerobic glycolytic pathway (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), tricarboxylic acid cycle (citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase), electron transfer chain (cytochrome oxidase), NAD+/NADH redox state (total NADH cytochrome c reductase). significance differences enzyme activities different ages different experimental conditions two tissue preparations two muscles determined ANOVA. MCA ETA2 used evaluate net effects experimental conditions. First, aging seem affect soleus gastrocnemius muscles way. gastrocnemius muscle, major changes seen enzymes glycolytic pathway, crude extracts. soleus muscle, striking changes enzyme activities function aging found crude mitochondrial fraction. also found hypoxia caused important changes 12-month-old rats ages (especially enzyme activities gastrocnemius muscle). Naftidrofuryl modified effects hypoxia sometimes investigations necessary draw conclusions pharmacological activity naftidrofuryl hypoxia.
