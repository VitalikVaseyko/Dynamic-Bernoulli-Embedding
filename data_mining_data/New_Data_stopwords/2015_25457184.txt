 aim study assess correlations PKM2 survival cardiomyocytes heart transplantation rat. PKM2, Bcl-xl, active caspase-3 proteins detected western blot, PKM2 testified immunohistochemistry immunofluorescence. time, active caspase-3, alpha-actinin, VCAM-1, CD4 detected immunofluorescence. Compared rare expression syngeneic Lewis rat hearts, PKM2 protein level allogeneic hearts detected various survival times transplantation, prominently expressed day five postoperatively. addition, examined expression Bcl-xl active caspase-3 allogeneic hearts, similar expression pattern PKM2. Immunohistochemical immunofluorescent methods displayed PKM2 widely expressed cardiac tissue, active caspase-3 also expressed cardiomyocytes. However, PKM2 expressed cells immune response cells. results suggested PKM2 may regulate survival cardiomyocytes acute rejection heart transplantation rat.
