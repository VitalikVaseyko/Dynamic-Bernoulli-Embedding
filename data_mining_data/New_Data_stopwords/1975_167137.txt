 Regulation cytoplasmic enzymes, pyruvate kinase (PK), glucokinase (GK), phosphoenolpy ruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDP), ATP citrate-lyase (ATP-CL), NAD-malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MD), NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MD), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), rat liver dietary fat (F diet) dietary sucrose (S diet) investigated. Mealfeeding diet adult rats 5 9 months resulted diurnal dietary response (i.e., food response) variation FDP, GK, ATP-CL, 6PGD, PK, meal-feeding diet young rats resulted diurnal dietary response variation ATP-CL, G6PD, NADP-MD, 6PGD, GPT, PK. Meal-feeding fat diet results essentially diurnal variation enzyme activity. overall effect meal-feeding, compared ad libitum feeding, diet increase levels G6PD, ATP-CL, NADP-MD decrease level PEck meal-fed rats. Young rats meal-fed two diets higher enzyme activities meal-fed adult rats observed enzymes (except GPT NAD-MD). general, hepatic levels enzymes studied low F diet-fed animals markedly higher diet-fed animals. results suggest dietary carbohydrate specifically induces enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism, whereas dietary fat affect levels. basis prior evidence early requirement RNA synthesis sucrose induction G6PD, widespread induction liver enzymes carbohydrate must indicate either increased synthesis ribosomal RNA later regulation synthesis specifically enzymes increased synthesis rather large group specific messenger RNAs i.e., coordinate genetic control number enzyme messenger RNAs.
