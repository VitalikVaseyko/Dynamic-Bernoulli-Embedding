 better understand global effects "natural" lesions genes involved pyruvate metabolism Mycobacterium bovis, null mutations made Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv ald pykA genes mimic M. bovis situation. Like M. bovis, M. tuberculosis DeltapykA mutant yielded dysgonic colonies solid medium lacking pyruvate, whereas colony morphology eugonic pyruvate-containing medium. Global effects loss pykA gene, possibly underlying colony morphology, investigated using proteomics cultures grown conditions. levels Icd2 increased Icl PckA decreased DeltapykA knockout. Proteomics suggested synthesis enzymes involved fatty acid lipid biosynthesis decreased, whereas involved beta-oxidation increased M. tuberculosis DeltapykA mutant, confirmed direct assays activities. Thus, loss pykA M. tuberculosis results fatty acids used principally energy production, contrast situation host carbon fatty acids conserved glyoxylate cycle gluconeogenesis; active pykA gene introduced M. bovis, opposite effects occurred. Proteins involved oxidative stress-AhpC, KatG, SodA-showed increased synthesis DeltapykA mutant, iron-regulated proteins also affected. Ald levels decreased DeltapykA knockout, explaining M. tuberculosis DeltapykA Deltaald double mutant showed little additional phenotypic effect. Overall, data show loss pykA gene powerful, global effects proteins associated central metabolism.
