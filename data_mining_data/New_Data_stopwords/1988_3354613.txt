 evaluated relation height rate clinical progression boys Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). all, 111 DMD patients age ranging 2 23 years (mean 8.2 +/- 3.4 years) assessed; patients, 92 height measured. Clinical course determined Vignos scale functional disability, motor ability, timed functional tests. patients grossly elevated serum creatine-kinase (CK) pyruvate-kinase (PK) levels. height adjusted patients' age, statistically significant correlation found height clinical course (positive Vignos scale negative motor ability), suggesting smaller boys better clinical course taller patients comparable age. results support previous hypothesis suggest growth inhibition seems effective diminishing progression DMD.
