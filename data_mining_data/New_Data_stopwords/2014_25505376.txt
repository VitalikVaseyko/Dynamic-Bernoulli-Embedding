 Lactate, conjugate base lactic acid occurring aqueous biological fluids, derided "dead-end" waste product anaerobic metabolism. Catalyzed near-equilibrium enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reduction pyruvate lactate thought serve regenerate NAD(+) necessary continued glycolytic flux. Reaction kinetics LDH imply lactate oxidation rarely favored tissues production. However, substantial body research directly contradicts notion LDH invariably operates unidirectionally vivo. current Perspective, model forwarded continuous formation oxidation lactate serves mitochondrial electron shuttle, whereby lactate generated cytosol cell oxidized mitochondria cell. perspective, intracellular lactate shuttle operates much like malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS); also proposed two shuttles necessarily interconnected lactate-MAS. Among requisite features model, significant compartmentalization LDH, much like creatine kinase phosphocreatine shuttle, would facilitate net cellular lactate oxidation variety cell types.
