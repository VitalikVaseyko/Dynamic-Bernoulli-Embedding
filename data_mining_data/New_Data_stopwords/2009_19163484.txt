 feasibility novel stirred bioreactor, rotating aerial disk (RAD) design, tested study. novelty lies method medium recirculation convective airflow using non-contact planar disc, variation physically defined theoretical model. Computational predictions improved oxygenation confirmed increases measured dissolved oxygen, even Reynolds numbers (100-200) flow mostly laminar. EL-4 mouse lymphoma cells grown first time suspension cultures RAD bioreactor, mechanically re-organization dense, circular three-dimensional colonies (diameter 3-5 mm, thickness 5-800 microm), rapidly observed previously. Cell proliferation RAD vessels similar static cultures, although lactate production glucose significantly lower, suggesting shift toward aerobic glycolysis. possible reversal 'Warburg effect' accompanied decrease mitochondrial activity, perhaps reflecting quiescent cytoplasmic state. RAD device may useful scalable, three-dimensional solid tumor model physiological conditions static culture.
