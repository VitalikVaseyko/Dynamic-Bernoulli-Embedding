 Fluorescence-activated flow cytometry used separate rat liver parenchymal cells five equal computer-generated regions basis mixed function activities towards diethoxyfluorescein. Enzymic activities sorted fractions showed 2.3-2.9-fold enrichment 3-cyano-7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities cells region 5. Cytochrome P-450 PBla glutamine synthase activities enriched 1.8- 7-fold respectively region 2 hepatocytes. Pretreatment rats phenobarbitone 3-methylcholanthrene change pattern enrichment respect monooxygenase lactate dehydrogenase activities. However, cytochrome P-450 PB3a MC1a respectively concentrated cells region 5. contrast, ethoxyquin caused enrichment cytochrome P-450 hepatocytes region 2. fraction also contained highest percentage gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase positive cells.
