 OBJECTIVES: Tumor M2-pyruvate kinase, tumor-associated dimeric form enzyme pyruvate kinase, commonly elevated pancreatic cancers. meta-analysis aimed evaluate diagnostic utility comparison carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) pancreatic cancer. METHODS: literature search conducted entries 1951 2006 using PubMed, Embase, Central, SCI Expanded databases using M2 pyruvate kinase pancreatic cancer/s tumor/s keywords. total 258 references retrieved. these, 118 duplicates removed 132 references excluded. studies comparing TuM2-PK CA19-9 pancreatic cancer included. Full text obtained 8 references 7 included studies. Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated available specificity sensitivity study pooled give overall DOR 95% CI TuM2-PK CA19-9. Receiver operator characteristic curve calculated give overall specificity sensitivity TuM2-PK. RESULTS: diagnostic performance TuM2-PK (DOR, 35; 95% CI, 19.7-62.3) similar CA19-9 (DOR, 44; 95% CI, 26.5-73.1). overall specificity TuM2-PK 60% corresponding sensitivity 95%. CONCLUSION: Efficacy TuM2-PK tumor marker similar CA19-9. trials needed use alone combination CA19-9 patients suspected pancreatic cancer.
