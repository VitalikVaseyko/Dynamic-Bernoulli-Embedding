 BACKGROUND: Biomarkers allowing characterization malignancy therapy response oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) types carcinomas still outstanding. biochemical suicide molecule endonuclease DNaseX (DNaseI-like 1) used identify Apo10 protein epitope marks tumor cells abnormal apoptosis proliferation. transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) represents enzymatic basis anaerobic glucose metabolism even presence oxygen (aerobic glycolysis/Warburg effect), concomitant malignant phenotype due invasive growth/metastasis resistance radical apoptosis inducing therapies. METHODS: Expression Apo10 TKTL1 analysed retrospectively OSCC specimen (n = 161) immunohistochemistry. markers represent independent markers poor survival. Furthermore Apo10 TKTL1 used prospectively epitope detection monocytes (EDIM)-blood test patients OSCC (n = 50), breast cancer (n = 48), prostate cancer (n = 115), blood donors/controls (n = 74). RESULTS: Positive Apo10 TKTL1 expression associated recurrence tumor. Multivariate analysis demonstrated Apo10 TKTL1 expression independent prognostic factor reduced tumor-specific survival. Apo10+/TKTL1+ subgroup showed worst disease-free survival rate OSCC.EDIM-Apo10 EDIM-TKTL1 blood tests allowed sensitive specific detection patients OSCC, breast cancer prostate cancer surgery care. combined score Apo10+/TKTL1+ led sensitivity 95.8% specificity 97.3% detection carcinomas independent tumor entity. CONCLUSIONS: combined detection two independent fundamental biophysical processes two biomarkers Apo10 TKTL1 allows sensitive specific detection neoplasia noninvasive cost-effective way. prospective trials warranted validate new concept diagnosis neoplasia tumor recurrence.
