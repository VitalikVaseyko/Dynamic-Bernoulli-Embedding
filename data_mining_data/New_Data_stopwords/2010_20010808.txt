 oxygen abundant, quiescent cells efficiently extract energy glucose primarily oxidative phosphorylation, whereas conditions tumour cells consume glucose avidly, converting lactate. long-observed phenomenon known aerobic glycolysis, important cell growth. aerobic glycolysis useful growing cells, tightly regulated proliferation-linked manner. mammals, partly achieved control pyruvate kinase isoform expression. embryonic pyruvate kinase isoform, PKM2, almost universally re-expressed cancer, promotes aerobic glycolysis, whereas adult isoform, PKM1, promotes oxidative phosphorylation. two isoforms result mutually exclusive alternative splicing PKM pre-mRNA, reflecting inclusion either exon 9 (PKM1) exon 10 (PKM2). show three heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) proteins, polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB, also known hnRNPI), hnRNPA1 hnRNPA2, bind repressively sequences flanking exon 9, resulting exon 10 inclusion. also demonstrate oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc upregulates transcription PTB, hnRNPA1 hnRNPA2, ensuring high PKM2/PKM1 ratio. Establishing relevance cancer, show human gliomas overexpress c-Myc, PTB, hnRNPA1 hnRNPA2 manner correlates PKM2 expression. results thus define pathway regulates alternative splicing event required tumour cell proliferation.
