 Erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase (AST) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities often used indices vitamin B-6 nutritional status; however, results using mixed population erythrocytes quite variable. Erythrocytes two strains mice (Mus domesticus), A/Ibg DBA/Ibg, separated according age centrifugation discontinuous Percoll density gradients three fractions: top (least dense, youngest), middle bottom (most dense, oldest). sufficient yield age-fractionated erythrocytes obtained single mouse enzyme measurements. activities AST, ALT three age-marker enzymes, pyruvate kinase, acetylcholinesterase hexokinase, found significantly higher youngest cell fractions, declined older, dense fractions. mice significantly lower AST ALT activities age separated fractions DBA mice. measurement enzyme activities low density, young cells may especially useful studies involving conditions proportion young erythrocytes may elevated respect entire erythrocyte mass.
