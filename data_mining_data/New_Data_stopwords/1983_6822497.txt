 level carboxyl methylation membrane proteins measured intact human erythrocyte populations different ages separated density gradient centrifugation. Age separation confirmed measurement cytosolic pyruvate kinase specific activity fraction. cells different ages incubated L-[methyl-3H]methionine, steady state level 3H radioactivity covalently bound membrane proteins observed least 3-fold higher older erythrocytes. specific radioactivity methyl group donor S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine identical age fractions, represents increase extent modification membrane proteins carboxyl methylation. three major methylated erythrocyte membrane proteins, increase carboxyl methylation age 4 7-fold bands 2.1 3, increase band 4.1 3 4-fold. increase steady state level methylation age cannot explained changes either intrinsic rate methyl transfer changes rate constant methyl turnover. We, therefore, propose age-dependent change carboxyl methylation due increase number available acceptor sites erythrocyte ages vivo. Since methylation acidic residues erythrocyte membrane proteins detected exclusively D-aspartic acid residues (McFadden, P. N., Clarke, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 2460-2464), results consistent accumulation D-aspartic acid membrane protein due spontaneous racemization cell ages. relationship observations possible functions erythrocyte membrane protein carboxyl methylation discussed.
