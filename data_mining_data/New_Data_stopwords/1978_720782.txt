 activity several regulatory enzymes representing pathways glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, NADPH generation lipogenesis measured rat placenta maternal foetal livers 20th day gestation. Streptozotocin diabetes, induced 12th day gestation, 48 h fasting induce adaptive changes activity placental enzymes producing typical insulin deficiency pattern maternal liver. Foetal liver enzyme activities unaffected fasting diabetes showed changes suggestive foetal hyperinsulinaemia. small increase observed activity placental pyruvate kinase small decrease PEP carboxylase diabetic glucocorticoid-treated rats; changes reciprocal maternal liver attributed hyperglycaemia, increase placental glycogen. Lack response insulin deficiency endocrine alterations indicates placenta sensitive stimuli induce adaptive alterations hepatic enzymes. consistent change found placental enzyme activities decrease associated gestational age.
