 Mammalian hibernation characterized general suppression energy expensive processes switch lipid oxidation primary fuel source. Glucose-responsive carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) yet studied hibernating organisms, prepare cold winter months feeding exhibit obesity-like state accompanied naturally-induced completely reversible insulin resistance. Studying ChREBP expression activity hibernating 13-lined ground squirrel important better understand molecular mechanisms regulate energy metabolism cellular stress. Immunoblotting used determine relative expression level subcellular localization ChREBP, well serine phosphorylation 95 kDa, comparing euthermic late torpid ground squirrel liver, kidney, heart muscle. DNA-binding ELISAs RT-PCR used explore ChREBP transcriptional activity cold stress. ChREBP activity seemed generally suppressed liver kidney. torpor, ChREBP total protein levels decreased 44% EC liver, phosphoserine levels increased 2.1-fold EC kidney, downstream Fasn/Pkl transcript levels decreased <60% EC liver. contrast, ChREBP activity generally increased torpor cardiac skeletal muscle, ChREBP total protein levels increased 1.5-fold 5-fold EC muscle heart, respectively; DNA-binding increased approximately 2-fold EC muscle; Fasn transcript levels increased 3-fold 7-fold muscle heart, respectively. summary, ChREBP tissue-specific role regulating energy metabolism hibernation.
