 possibility glycosomes present bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei [Opperdoes, F. R. Borst, P. (1977) FEBS Lett. 80, 360--364] constitute separate pool glycolytic intermediates within cell investigated. titrations intact cells digitonin, differential activation glycolytic enzymes observed. Enolase, pyruvate kinase cell-sap marker alanine aminotransferase activated 0.05 mg digitonin per mg protein. nine glycosomal enzymes involved conversion glucose glycerol 3-phosphoglycerate activated digitonin concentrations 0.7 9.8 mg/mg protein. subcellular fractions activities latter enzymes latent 70 92%. Latency abolished addition 0.1% Triton X-100 partly five cycles freezing thawing. conclude glycosomal enzymes surrounded membrane, forms permeability barrier intermediates co-factors glycolysis. concentrations glycolytic intermediates adenine nucleotides measured aerobic conditions well presence 1 mM salicylhydroxamic acid, respiratory inhibitor. Addition salicylhydroxamic acid caused following changes: (a) levels almost glycolytic intermediates measured decreased. Glycerol-3-phosphate, however, increased fourfold. (b) phosphate potential drastically lowered 2900 450 M-1. (c) trypanosomes became reduced, monitored change apparent redox state NADH/NAD+ courple E'h = -189 E'h = -219 mV. high levels metabolite concentrations found comparison apparent mass-action ratios calculated separate glycolytic reactions organisms, conclude bloodstream form T. brucei glycolytic intermediates present glycosomes well cytosol two pools intermediates equilibrate other, despite presence glycosomal membrane.
