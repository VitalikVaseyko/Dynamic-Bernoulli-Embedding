 Four people family red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) hyperactivity described. people displayed low 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) high adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. vitro metabolism studies red cells showed relationship PK activity, low 2,3-DPG, high ATP levels. PK electrophoretic pattern subjects abnormal presence several additional bands; one migrated like PKM2. PKR people thermounstable M2-like PK identical PKM2 immunologic reactivity KO, 5s phosphoenolpyruvate.
