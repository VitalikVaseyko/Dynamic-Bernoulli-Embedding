 activity enzymes regulatory function pathways glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, NADPH generation fatty acid synthesis measured placenta liver rats. Compared liver, high activity pyruvate kinase found placenta, indicating high glycolytic potential; small capacity gluconeogenesis also present moderate low activity enzymes associated lipogenesis. activity placental enzymes fell day 15 20 gestation irrespective pathway represented. pattern decline continued gestation prolonged day 26 administration chorionic gonadotropin. rates activity disappearance 11 days gestation differed enzyme, half-lives ranging 2.7 days NADP-malate dehydrogenase 7 days glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. contrast, activity hepatic enzymes either remained unchanged showed individual adaptation advancing pregnancy. regression placental metabolic capacity day 15 gestation also evident decrease glucose uptake channelling lactate, CO2, glycerol fatty acids. addition, placental ageing associated triglyceride accumulation, mainly due decrease free fatty acid oxidation. Treatment pregnant rats several hormones, markedly affecting hepatic enzyme activities, failed induce appreciable changes corresponding placental enzymes. illustrated case triiodothyronine treatment. Similarly, insulin deficiency induced streptozotocin failed elicit adaptive changes placental enzyme activities typical diabetes like occurring maternal liver; converse responses placenta attributed hyperglycaemia. hand, responses fetal liver enzymes suggestive fetal hyperinsulinaemia. observations indicate placental enzymes susceptible endocrine regulation imply placental metabolism largely independent physiopathological alterations affecting maternal organism. gradual activity decreases gestation suggest enzyme complement placenta, developed, designed last limited lifespan without continuous replenishment. Within context, mechanism seems operate ind1ce adaptive synthesis individual enzymes, age placenta appears primary factor determining enzyme activity metabolic performance.
