 AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) sensor cellular energy status appears arisen early eukaryotic evolution. unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, AMPK orthologue activated glucose starvation required switch glycolysis (fermentation) oxidative metabolism glucose runs low. mammals, rapidly proliferating cells (including tumour cells) immune cells involved inflammation tend utilize rapid glucose uptake glycolysis (termed Warburg effect aerobic glycolysis) rather oxidative metabolism satisfy high demand ATP. Since mammalian AMPK, similar yeast orthologue, tends promote energy-efficient oxidative metabolism expense glycolysis, might expected drugs activate AMPK would inhibit cell proliferation hence cancer, well exerting anti-inflammatory effects. Evidence supporting view discussed, including findings AMPK activated classic anti-inflammatory drug salicylate.
