 1. modification pyruvate kinase activity vitro examined altering environmental [Mg(2+)]/[Ca(2+)] ratio EDTA one hand isolated rat liver mitochondria other. 2. Controlled additions Ca(2+) EDTA caused pyruvate kinase activity alternately rapidly switched off. 3. able accumulate Ca(2+) preference Mg(2+) rat liver mitochondria able alter [Mg(2+)]/[Ca(2+)] ratio vicinity pyruvate kinase thereby modify activity enzyme. 4. possible role mitochondria modifying pyruvate kinase ion-sensitive cytoplasmic enzyme activities discussed.
