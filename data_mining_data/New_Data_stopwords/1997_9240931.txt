 Regulation gene expression nutrients important mechanism adaptation mammals nutritional environment. especially true enzymes involved storage energy, lipogenic glycolytic enzymes liver adipose tissue. Transcription genes lipogenic glycolytic enzymes stimulated glucose adipose tissue, liver, pancreatic beta-cells. Several lines evidence suggest glucose must metabolized glucose-6-phosphate stimulate gene transcription. adipose tissue, insulin increases expression lipogenic enzymes indirectly stimulating glucose uptake. liver, insulin also acts indirectly stimulating expression glucokinase and, hence, increasing glucose metabolism. Glucose response elements characterized L-pyruvate kinase S14 genes. common presence sequence 5'-CACGTG-3', binds transcription factor called USF (upstream stimulatory factor). Another glucose response element, uses transcription factor named Sp1, characterized gene acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase. mechanisms linking glucose-6-phosphate glucose-responsive transcription complex largely unknown.
