 Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) frequent red blood cell enzyme abnormality glycolytic pathway common cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. 250 PKLR-gene mutations described, including missense/nonsense, splicing regulatory mutations, small insertions, small gross deletions, causing PKD hemolytic anemia variable severity. Alu retrotransposons abundant mobile DNA sequences human genome, contributing almost 11% mass. Alu insertions associated number human diseases either disrupting coding region splice signal. Here, report two unrelated Middle Eastern patients, born consanguineous parents, transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia, sequence analysis revealed homozygous insertion AluYb9 within exon 6 PKLR gene, causing precipitous decrease PKLR RNA levels. Alu element insertion consists previously unrecognized mechanism underlying pathogenesis PKD.
