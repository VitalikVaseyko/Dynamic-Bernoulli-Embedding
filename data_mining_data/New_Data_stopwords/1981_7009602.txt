 Human erythrocytes separated according age determine whether heterogeneity specific binding 125I-insulin red cells. mean cell age erythrocyte isolates determined cumulative distribution frequency cells isotonic (290 milliosmolar) density gradient confirmed assay pyruvate kinase, age-dependent red cell enzyme. IBM 2997 centrifugal cell separator used obtain larger quantities younger erythrocytes normal subjects. 125I-insulin binding red cells including reticulocytes found decrease exponentially function mean cell age 8 normal subjects. change receptor number rather affinity appeared account observed change 125I-insulin binding. exponential, age-dependent change binding hormone cell membrane bound receptor previously observed. Consistent results possibility regulation red cell insulin receptor concentration takes place younger red cells.
