 BACKGROUND: Severe pandemic influenza (H1N1) infection lead acute respiratory failure (ARF) associated high mortality. Children malignancy may higher risk H1N1-associated ARF underlying primary disease immunosuppression associated chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: describe clinical course outcome critically ill pediatric oncology/hematology patients H1N1-associated ARF. RESULTS: Five patients admitted St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) ICU H1N1 infection 2009-2010 influenza season. Underlying diagnoses included 2 patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia one neuroblastoma, brainstem glioma, hemolytic anemia secondary pyruvate kinase deficiency. patients mechanically ventilated secondary ARF following unsuccessful trials non-invasive ventilatory support. majority patients (4/5) required inotropic support, none required dialysis. measures support ARF included high frequency oscillatory ventilation 2 patients, nitric oxide 3 patients, surfactant 1 patient. Three patients bronchopleural air leak. patients received oseltamivir; however, 2 switched intravenous zanamivir resistance oseltamivir documented. Mean duration mechanical ventilation 24 +/- 6.8 days mean duration ICU admission 37 +/- 12 days. patients survived hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: series suggests overall favorable outcome immunocompromised children H1N1-related ARF. experience underscores value aggressive support H1N1-related ARF, early detection management oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 infection high-risk population.
