 established characteristic neoplastic cells metabolic reprogramming, known Warburg effect, greater reliance energetically less efficient pathways (such glycolysis pentose phosphate shunt) compared oxidative phosphorylation. results overproduction acidic species must extruded maintain intracellular homeostasis. recently described blocking proton currents leukemic cells mediated Hv1 ion channels triggers marked intracellular acidification apoptosis induction. Moreover, histamine H1-receptor antagonists found induce apoptosis tumoral cells mechanism still unclear. using Jurkat cells, show diphenhydramine inhibits Hv1 mediated currents, inducing drop intracellular pH cellular viability. provides evidence new target structure responsible known pro-apoptotic action antihistaminic drugs.
