 decade ago, team biochemists including two us, modeled yeast glycolysis showed one studied biochemical pathways could quite understood terms kinetic properties constituent enzymes measured cell extract. Moreover, model later applied different experimental steady-state conditions, often exhibited unrestrained metabolite accumulation.Here resolve issue showing results ab initio modeling improved substantially (i) including appropriate allosteric regulation (ii) measuring enzyme kinetic parameters conditions resemble intracellular environment. following modifications proved crucial: (i) implementation allosteric regulation hexokinase pyruvate kinase, (ii) implementation V(max) values measured conditions resembled yeast cytosol, (iii) redetermination kinetic parameters glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase physiological conditions.Model predictions experiments compared five different conditions yeast growth starvation. either original model used (which lacked important allosteric regulation), enzyme parameters measured conditions were, usual, optimal high enzyme activity, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate glycolytic intermediates tended accumulate unrealistically high concentrations. Combining adjustments yielded accurate correspondence model experiments five steady-state dynamic conditions. enhances understanding vivo metabolism terms vitro biochemistry.
