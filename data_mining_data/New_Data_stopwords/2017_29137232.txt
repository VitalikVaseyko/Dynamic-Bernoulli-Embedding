 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) humans deadly disease associated dietary zinc (Zn)-deficiency. rat esophagus, Zn-deficiency induces cell proliferation, alters mRNA microRNA gene expression, promotes ESCC. investigated whether Zn-deficiency alters cell metabolism evaluating metabolomic profiles esophageal epithelia Zn-deficient replenished rats vs sufficient rats, using untargeted gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (n = 8/group). Zn-deficient proliferative esophagus exhibits distinct metabolic profile glucose 153-fold lactic acid 1.7-fold (P < 0.0001), indicating aerobic glycolysis (the "Warburg effect"), hallmark cancer cells. Zn-replenishment rapidly increases glucose content, restores deregulated metabolites control levels, reverses hyperplastic phenotype. Integration metabolomics reported transcriptomic data tissue unveils link glucose down-regulation overexpression HK2, enzyme catalyzes first step glycolysis overexpressed cancer cells. Searching published microRNA profile, find tumor-suppressor miR-143, negative regulator HK2, down-regulated Zn-deficient esophagus. Using situ hybridization immunohistochemical analysis, inverse correlation miR-143 down-regulation HK2 overexpression documented hyperplastic Zn-deficient esophagus, archived ESCC-bearing Zn-deficient esophagus, human ESCC tissues. Thus, sustain uncontrolled cell proliferation, Zn-deficiency reprograms glucose metabolism modulating expression miR-143 target HK2. work provides new insight critical roles Zn ESCC development prevention.
