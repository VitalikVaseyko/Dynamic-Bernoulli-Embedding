 BACKGROUND: Like normal hematopoietic stem cells, leukemia cells proliferate bone marrow, oxygen supply limited. However, growth energy metabolism leukemia cells hypoxia well understood. Although known reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated hypoxic conditions, normal leukemia stem cells characterized relatively low levels ROS. Roles ROS leukemia cells hypoxia also well understood. METHODS: Four Leukemia cell lines cultured normoxia (21% O2) hypoxia (1% O2), NB4 THP-1 extensively studied. evaluate energy metabolism, estimated whole cell number apoptotic cells without glycolysis inhibitor oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitor. Glucose consumption lactate production also measured. evaluate oxidative stress hypoxic condition, ROS level GSH (reduced glutathione) / GSSG (oxidized glutathione) ratio measured. addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (COX4) examined western blotting RT-PCR. RESULTS: NB4, grows well normoxia depending glycolysis, demonstrated prominent apoptosis growth suppression 48 hours culture hypoxia. NB4 cells cultured hypoxia showed significantly increased ROS. Culture ROS scavenger resulted decrease apoptotic cell death NB4 hypoxia. NB4 cells cultured longer period (7 days) hypoxia come extinction, grew slowly upregulating GSH synthesis protect ROS generated hypoxic condition. contrast, THP-1, largely depends OXPHOS mitochondria normoxia, demonstrated growth hypoxia changing metabolism OXPHOS glycolysis upregulating PDK1. Moreover, THP-1 avoided ROS generation substituting COX 4 subunit (from COX 4-1 COX 4-2) upregulation LON, mitochondrial protease hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: showed leukemia cells survive adapt hypoxic condition various pathways. results help understanding energy metabolism leukemia cells creating novel therapeutics.
