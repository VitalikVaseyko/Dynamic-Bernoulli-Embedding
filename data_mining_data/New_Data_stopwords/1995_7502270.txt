 RheothRx Injection, aqueous solution nonionic block copolymer (poloxamer 188) formulated intravenous administration, investigated inhibitor red blood cell (RBC)-induced platelet aggregation plasma concentrations 0.05-5mgmL-1. Platelet aggregation determined measuring fall single platelet counts mechanical agitation 2mL aliquots citrated whole blood 37 degrees C shaking waterbath. Inhibition RBC-induced platelet aggregation > 95% observed poloxamer 188 concentration 1mgmL-1, 41% inhibition observed 0.05mgmL-1. Poloxamer 188 observed effective inhibitor RBC-induced platelet aggregation 2-chloradenosine (2-ClAd) phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase (PEP/PK). Studies using platelet rich plasma (PRP) showed platelet aggregation could induced shaking absence RBC, though aggregation induced addition exogenous adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Poloxamer 188 inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation. propose poloxamer 188 protects RBC mechanical trauma non-specific adsorption copolymer RBC surface (via hydrophobic polyoxypropylene moiety), effect prevents mechanical damage hence leakage ADP RBC. RheothRx Injection shown value treatment acute ischemic disorders myocardial infarction. observation significant inhibition RBC-induced platelet aggregation clinically relevant concentrations suggests RheothRx Injection may antithrombotic properties vivo, may therefore potential acute ischemia also prevent thrombosis within vascular prostheses prevent rethrombosis angioplasty endarterectomy.
