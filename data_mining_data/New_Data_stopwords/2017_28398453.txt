 Drug carrier ratio important consideration designing drug platforms, since low loading capacity necessitates use high doses carriers, result side effects. Here, engineered platform co-deliver small molecule drugs small interfering RNA (siRNA). platform consists cyclodextrin-grafted polyethylenimine (CP) functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNP). unique multi-step encapsulation procedure used obtain high loading capacity doxorubicin (DOX) siRNA oligos specific PKM2 gene encodes pyruvate kinase M2, enzyme catalyzing final rate-limiting step glycolysis. systematically characterized platform (CP-MSNP@DOX/PKM2) vitro evaluated therapeutic efficacy vivo mouse model triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Exposure TNBC cells CP-MSNP@DOX/PKM2 resulted suppressed target gene expression, reduced cell proliferation, enhanced apoptosis. Intravenous administration drug substantially decreased tumor burden comparison DOX siRNA monotherapy. conclusion, developed platform efficient co-delivery small molecule drugs therapeutic siRNA.
