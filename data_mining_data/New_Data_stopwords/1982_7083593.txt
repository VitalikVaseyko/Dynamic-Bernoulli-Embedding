 simple enzymatic spectrophotometric micromethod described direct kinetic assay acetate serum plasma using Eni-Gemsaec centrifugal fast analyser. method based transformation acetate ATP acetylphosphate ADP acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1). ADP measured two coupling reactions involving pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) measurement NADH consumption 340 nm. method involves reagent blank compensation reagent deterioration, preincubation 3 min without acetate kinase eliminate interference due endogenous pyruvate, two-point kinetic protocol measurements absorbance 95s 395 s. analytical performances proposed method investigated using evaluation scheme proposed French Society Clinical Biology.
