 Refeeding carbohydrate fasted rats induces transcription genes encoding enzymes fatty acid biosynthesis, e.g. fatty-acid synthase (FAS). Part transcriptional induction mediated insulin. insulin response element described fatty-acid synthase gene region -600 +65, 2-3-fold increase fatty-acid synthase promoter activity attributable region small compared 20-30-fold induction fatty-acid synthase gene transcription observed fasted rats refed carbohydrate. previously reported fatty-acid synthase gene region -7382 -6970 essential achieving high vivo rates gene transcription. studies current report demonstrate region -7382 -6970 fatty-acid synthase gene contains carbohydrate response element (CHO-RE(FAS)) palindrome sequence (CATGTGn(5)GGCGTG) nearly identical CHO-RE l-type pyruvate kinase S(14) genes. glucose responsiveness imparted CHO-RE(FAS) independent insulin. Moreover, CHO-RE(FAS) conferred glucose responsiveness heterologous promoter (i.e. l-type pyruvate kinase). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated CHO-RE(FAS) readily bound unique hepatic ChoRF CHO-RE(FAS) competed CHO-RE l-type pyruvate kinase S(14) genes ChoRF binding. vivo footprinting revealed fasting reduced refeeding increased ChoRF binding CHO-RE(FAS). Thus, carbohydrate responsiveness rat liver fatty-acid synthase appears require insulin glucose signaling pathways. importantly, unique hepatic ChoRF shown recognize glucose responsive sequences common three different genes: fatty-acid synthase, l-type pyruvate kinase, S(14).
