 effects administration insulin glucagon intraacinar heterotopy phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) investigated male female rat liver. Insulin noticeably influence PEPCK activity acinar distribution, either males females. affected activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase malic enzyme. Glucagon supraphysiological concentrations led induction PEPCK activity. Despite high glucagon concentration along whole sinusoidal length, inducing effect glucagon pronounced periportal intermediary parts acinus; thus indicating direct interrelationship local glucagon concentration PEPCK activity. experiments blood glucose levels kept fairly constant.
