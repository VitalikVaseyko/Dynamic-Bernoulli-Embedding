 RBC K loss cellular dehydration associated variety normal abnormal erythrocyte conditions. cases (normal RBC aging, pyruvate-kinase-deficient RBCs irreversibly sickled cells) cation water changes related adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion increased RBC calcium content. disorders, hereditary xerocytosis, cation depletion cellular hydration related altered energy calcium metabolism. Rather, condition thought due structural membrane defect manifested imbalanced cation leaks (K less greater Na gain) active cation transport unable compensate. None disorders described associated known structural membrane alterations. fact K loss cellular dehydration common several RBC disorders suggests phenomenon may direct role membrane injury. hypothesis supported two separate observations: 1)Formation irreversible sickled cells vitro prevented K water loss inhibited, effects independent ATP depletion calcium accumulation; 2) mean critical hemolytic volume markedly reduced K- water-depleted normal RBCs. RBC dehydration without intracellular cation depletion, however, associated changes mean critical hemolytic volume. data thus indicate K loss may direct role RBC membrane injury. mechanism occurs associated alterations membrane structure, however, remain identified.
