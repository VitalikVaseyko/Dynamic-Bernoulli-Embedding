 tendency exons correspond discrete units protein structure protein-coding genes ancient origin would provide clear evidence favor exon theory genes, proposes split genes arose insertion introns unsplit genes, combinations primordial mini-genes (exons) separated spacers (introns). Although putative examples correspondence strongly influenced previous debate origin introns, general correspondence rigorously proved. Objective methods detecting correspondences developed applied four examples cited previously evidence exon theory genes. significant correspondence exons units protein structure detected, suggesting putative correspondence exist exon theory genes untenable.
