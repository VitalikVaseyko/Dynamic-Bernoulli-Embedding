 Carbohydrate regulatory element-binding protein (ChREBP), MAX-like factor X (MLX), hepatic nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4alpha) key transcription factors involved glucose-mediated induction hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene transcription. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) WY14643 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonist) interfere glucose-stimulated L-PK gene transcription vivo rat primary hepatocytes. Feeding rats diet containing n-3 PUFA WY14643 suppressed hepatic mRNA(L-PK) suppress hepatic ChREBP HNF-4alpha nuclear abundance. Hepatic MLX nuclear abundance, however, suppressed n-3 PUFA WY14643. rat primary hepatocytes, glucose-stimulated accumulation mRNA(LPK) L-PK promoter activity correlated increased ChREBP nuclear abundance. treatment also increased L-PK promoter occupancy RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II), acetylated histone H3 (Ac-H3), acetylated histone H4 (Ac-H4) significantly impact L-PK promoter occupancy ChREBP HNF-4alpha. Inhibition L-PK promoter activity n-3 PUFA correlated suppressed RNA pol II, Ac-H3, Ac-H4 occupancy L-PK promoter. Although n-3 PUFA transiently suppressed ChREBP MLX nuclear abundance, treatment impact ChREBP-LPK promoter interaction. HNF4alpha-LPK promoter interaction transiently suppressed n-3 PUFA. Inhibition L-PK promoter activity WY14643 correlated transient decline ChREBP nuclear abundance decreased Ac-H4 interaction L-PK promoter. WY14643, however, impact MLX nuclear abundance HNF4alpha-LPK promoter interaction. Although overexpressed ChREBP HNF-4alpha relieve n-3 PUFA suppression L-PK gene expression, overexpressed MLX fully abrogated n-3 PUFA suppression L-PK promoter activity mRNA(L-PK) abundance. Overexpressed ChREBP, MLX, relieved WY14643 inhibition L-PK. conclusion, n-3 PUFA WY14643/PPARalpha target different transcription factors control L-PK gene transcription. MLX, heterodimer partner ChREBP, emerged novel target n-3 PUFA regulation.
