 Stoichiometry, kinetics, optical properties rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase activated Co(II), Ni(II), Mg(II), Mn(II) studied. stoichiometry metal binding enzyme found 4 metal ions per tetrameric enzyme Co(II) Ni(II) carrying circular dichroic titrations. Cu(II) Fe(II) inactive. Ca(II) Zn(II) activating, inhibitory respect active cations. temperature dependence optimal velocity similar activating metals. pH rate profiles suggest two classes enzyme activation metal ions. Mg(II) Mn(II) quite similar Co(II) Ni(II) different similar other. Absorption, natural, magnetic CD visible region used probe environment activating divalent cation Ni(II)- Co(II)-activated pyruvate kinase complexes substrates inhibitors...
