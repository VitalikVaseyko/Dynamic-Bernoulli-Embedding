 understanding molecular mechanisms allostery rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (RMPK) still infancy. Although, paucity knowledge ground rules functions regulated, RMPK ideal system address basic questions regarding fundamental chemical principles governing regulatory mechanisms enzyme TIM (alpha/beta)(8) barrel structural motif [Copley, R.

Besides basic TIM-barrel motif, RMPK also exhibits looped-out regions alpha/beta barrel monomer forming B- C-domains. two isozymes PK, namely, kidney muscle isozymes, exhibit different allosteric behaviors experimental condition. amino acid sequence differences mammalian kidney muscle PK isozymes located C-domain involved intersubunit interactions. Thus, embedded two isozymes PK rules involved engineering popular TIM (alpha/beta)(8) motif modulate allosteric properties. PK system exhibits lot properties allow mining ground rules governing correlative linkages sequence-fold-function. chapter, review approaches acquire fundamental functional structural energetics establish linkages among intricate network linked multiequilibria. Results diverse approaches integrated establish working model represent complex network multiple linked reactions ultimately leads observation allosteric regulation PK.
