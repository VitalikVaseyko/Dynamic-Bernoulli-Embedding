 Histidinemia inborn error metabolism amino acids caused deficiency histidase activity liver skin consequent accumulation histidine plasma tissues. Histidinemia autosomal recessive trait usually considered harmless patients offspring, patients children born histidinemic mothers mild neurologic alterations. Considering histidinemia one frequently identified metabolic conditions, present study investigated effect L-histidine load female rats pregnancy lactation parameters phosphoryltransfer network cerebral cortex hippocampus offspring. Pyruvate kinase, cytosolic mitochondrial creatine kinase activities decreased cerebral cortex hippocampus rats 21 days age pattern remained cerebral cortex hippocampus 60 days age. Moreover, adenylate kinase activity reduced cerebral cortex hippocampus offspring 21 days age, whereas activity increased two tissues 60 days age. results suggest administration L-histidine female rats course pregnancy lactation could impair energy homeostasis cerebral cortex hippocampus offspring. Considering histidinemia usually benign condition little attention given maternal histidinemia, seems important perform studies children born histidinemic mothers.
