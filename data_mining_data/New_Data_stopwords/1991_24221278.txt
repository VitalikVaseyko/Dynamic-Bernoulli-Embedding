 simple rapid photometric method developed order evaluate growth responses cells various factors vitro. Cells Asparagus officinalis L. mixed autoclaved agar 40 degrees C 90 mul drops dispensed several Petri dishes. drops solidified, covered liquid growth medium incubated gyratory shaker. Growth measured every 2 3 days two methods. first, agar drop placed stereomicroscope substage illumination light passing embedded cells measured light-meter. Growth, expressed increase cell density, inversely proportional intensity transmitted light. second method, agar drop melted microwave oven packed cell volume measured. correlation two methods showed photometric method used assess growth response immobilized cells, first two weeks culture. method used evaluate growth responses toxin fusaric acid gamma radiation. photometric method requires small amount inoculum, standard microscopic equipment used determine effect various factors growth intact plant cells vitro without disruption.
