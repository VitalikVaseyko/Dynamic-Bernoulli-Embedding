 tested vitro effects various glucose concentrations activity hepatic pyruvate kinase, assayed subsaturating, near physiological concentration (0.20 mmol/l) substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, detect "active" form enzyme. 10-min incubation mouse liver slices (n = 18) increasing glucose concentrations (5, 10 20 mmol/l) resulted significant (p less 0.01), progressive pyruvate kinase inhibition 15, 28 41%, respectively. Similar data obtained incubating mouse liver homogenates (n = 7) glucose, although material (which supplemented pyruvate kinase activator fructose-1,6-diphosphate) inhibition highest glucose concentration used lower (24%, p less 0.02). Addition 10 nmol/l insulin slice incubation (n = 8) prevented 98% 69% inhibition exerted 10 20 mmol/l glucose, respectively. Insulin alone without effect enzyme activity. Glucose might inhibit pyruvate kinase competing activator fructose-1,6-diphosphate. Insulin might overcome glucose effect activating pyruvate kinase known mechanism enzyme dephosphorylation. Thus, decompensated diabetes high level blood glucose may contribute, together counterregulatory hormones, inhibit hepatic pyruvate kinase therefore stimulate gluconeogenesis.
