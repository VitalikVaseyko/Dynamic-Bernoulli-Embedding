 purpose present study investigate effects 8 months specific controlled sprint training programme three groups young athletes (two groups males one females). Biopsies vastus lateralis taken period training. type percentage diameter fibres, well glycogen content activities enzymes glycogen metabolism (glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase), glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, aldolase lactate dehydrogenase), oxidative metabolism (succinate dehydrogenase) creatine kinase aminotransferases studied. results show increase percentage type fibres increase diameter fibre types. significant increase also observed glycogen content, activities glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase. conclude long period sprint training induces biochemical muscle adaptation anaerobic exercise. metabolic adaptation followed morphological adaptation, although probably specific biochemical one.
