 Excess carbohydrate intake leads fat accumulation insulin resistance. Glucose insulin coordinately regulate de novo lipogenesis glucose liver, insulin activates several transcription factors including SREBP1c LXR, activated glucose remain unknown. Recently, carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), binds carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) promoter rat liver type pyruvate kinase (LPK), identified. target genes ChREBP involved glycolysis, lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis. Although regulation ChREBP remains unknown detail, transactivity ChREBP partly regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. fasting, protein kinase AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylate ChREBP inactivate transactivity. feeding, xylulose-5-phosphate hexose monophosphate pathway activates protein phosphatase 2A, dephosphorylates ChREBP activates transactivity. ChREBP controls 50% hepatic lipogenesis regulating glycolytic lipogenic gene expression. ChREBP (-/-) mice, liver triglyceride content decreased liver glycogen content increased compared wild-type mice. results indicate ChREBP regulate metabolic gene expression convert excess carbohydrate triglyceride rather glycogen. Furthermore, complete inhibition ChREBP ob/ob mice reduces effects metabolic syndrome obesity, fatty liver, glucose intolerance. Thus, clarification physiological role ChREBP may useful developing treatments metabolic syndrome.
