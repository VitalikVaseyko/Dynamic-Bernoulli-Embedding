 flow cytometry-based test using eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) dye used diagnosis hereditary spherocytosis (HS). mean fluorescence intensiy (MFI) EMA tagged erythrocytes lower HS hemolytic nonhemolytic anemias. enrolled 114 subjects comprising 20 confirmed HS, 20 suspected HS/hemolytic anemia (HA), 20 normal controls, 20 hemolytic anemias [13 autoimmune hemolytic anemia, three congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA), one pyruvate kinase deficiency, two microangiopathic hemolytic anemia], 18 microcytic anemia 16 macrocytic anemia cases. samples subjected flow cytometry per standard protocol. mean MFI normal control subjects 11 861.5 (SD 883.5) confirmed HS 7949.3 (SD 1304.1). Using test, 20 patients suspected HS/HA confirmatory diagnosis, eight patients diagnosed HS. Using logistic regression analysis, optimum cut-off MFI value HS normal controls 10126. area ROC curve 0.99. statistical significance MFI values obtained t-test Wilcoxon rank sum test applicable. Compared normal controls, MFI values HS lower megaloblastic anemia higher statistically highly significant (P<0.01), MFI values CDA lower statistically significant (P<0.05). False-positive values obtained three cases AIHA two cases CDA. sensitivity specificity 96.4% 94.2% respectively. EMA-based flow cytometry test highly sensitive specific method diagnosis HS.
