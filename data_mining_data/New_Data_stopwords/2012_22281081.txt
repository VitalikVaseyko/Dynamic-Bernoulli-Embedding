 Previous studies shown developmental kinetic rates following IVF lower female male blastocysts may related differences glucose metabolism. addition, inhibition phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibits glucose uptake murine blastocysts. Therefore, aim study identify compare expression proteins involved glucose metabolism (hexokinase-I, HK-I; phosphofructokinase-1, PFK-1; pyruvate kinase 1/2, PK1/2; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH; glucose transporter-1, GLUT-1; glycogen synthase kinase-3, GSK-3) male female bovine blastocysts determine whether PI3-K role regulation expression proteins. Hexokinase-I, PFK-1, PK1/2, GAPDH GLUT-1 present bovine embryos. Protein expression proteins GSK-3 significantly higher male compared female blastocysts. Inhibition PI3-K LY294002 significantly decreased expression HK-I, PFK-1, GAPDH, GSK-3A/B GLUT-1. Results showed expression glycolytic proteins HK-I, PFK-1, GAPDH PK1/2, transporters GLUT-1 GSK-3 regulated PI3-K bovine blastocysts. Moreover, differential protein expression observed male female blastocysts might explain faster developmental kinetics seen males, expression main proteins involved glycolysis glycogenogenesis significantly higher male female bovine embryos also could explain sensitivity male embryos high concentration glucose, positive correlation GLUT-1 expression glucose uptake embryos demonstrated.
