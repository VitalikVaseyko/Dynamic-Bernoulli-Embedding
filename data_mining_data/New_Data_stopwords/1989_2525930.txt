 functional properties mitochondria bound hexokinase compared two subpopulations HT29 human colon cancer cell-line: (1) HT29 Glc+ cells, cultured presence glucose, poorly differentiated highly glycolytic (2) HT29 Glc- cells, adapted grow glucose-free medium, 'enterocyte-like' differentiated less glycolytic given glucose (Zweibaum et al. (1985) J. Cell Physiol. 122, 21-28). activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1 pyruvate kinase found twice high Glc+ cells compared Glc- cells. Besides, respiration rate decreased Glc+ cells compared Glc- cells. results correlate higher glycolytic rate Glc+ cells. many tissues, shown binding hexokinase mitochondrial outer membrane allows preferential utilization ATP generated oxidative phosphorylation which, turn, activated immediate restitution ADP. highly glycolytic cancer cells, although large fraction hexokinase bound mitochondria, existence channeling nucleotides still poorly documented. rates glucose phosphorylation bound hexokinase investigated mitochondria isolated Glc+ Glc- cells either exogenous ATP ATP generated mitochondria supplied ADP succinate (endogenous ATP). Diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ado2P5), oligomycin carboxyatractyloside (CAT) used combination separately metabolic inhibitors adenylate kinase, ATP synthase ATP/ADP translocator, respectively. Exogenous ATP appears 6.5-times efficient endogenous ATP supporting hexokinase activity mitochondria Glc+ cells 1.8-times cells. rate oxidative phosphorylation higher mitochondria Glc- cells, hexokinase activity higher model ATP generated respiration. Furthermore, Glc+ mitochondria, adenylate kinase reaction appears important source endogenous ATP bound hexokinase, while, Glc- mitochondria, hexokinase activity almost totally dependent ATP generated oxidative phosphorylation. result might explained previous finding mitochondria Glc+ cells lack contact sites outer inner membrane, whereas numerous contacts observed mitochondria Glc- cells (Denis-Pouxviel et al. (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 902, 335-348).
