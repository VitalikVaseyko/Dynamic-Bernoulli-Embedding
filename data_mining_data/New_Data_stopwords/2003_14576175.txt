 High-fructose feeding causes diet-induced alterations lipid metabolism decreased insulin sensitivity alterations hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase hepatic low-density lipoprotein secretion. Inflammatory cytokines also induce dramatic changes lipid metabolism, particularly serum triglycerides via increased hepatic secretion and/or delayed clearance low-density lipoprotein. aim study determine whether mechanism lipid dysregulation high-fructose diet induced stress response pathways. Animals fed high-fructose diet 14 establish hypertriglyceridemia treated lipoxygenase inhibitors 4 concurrent diet. end drug treatment, animals divided two groups treated lipopolysaccharide vehicle. Serum samples taken pretreatment posttreatment, liver tissue harvested end study. Serum samples tested metabolic parameters, tissue samples tested metabolic stress pathway responses. results show fructose-fed rats changes c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway correspondingly elevated activator protein-1 activity, consistent inflammatory response. Treatment lipoxygenase inhibitors reversed hypertriglyceridemia also reduced activator protein-1 activation, suggesting basis lipid dysregulation model due activation inflammatory pathways liver.
