 Dietary regulation jejunal glycolytic regulatory enzymes disaccharidases studied 9 obese subjects, aged 9 18 years. subjects divided two groups basis altered carbohydrate metabolism measured circadian insulin levels flux glucose, inorganic phosphorus, insulin measured 5-hr oral glucose tolerance test. patients nocturnal hyperinsulinemia abnormal carbohydrate flux showed adaptation jejunal enzymes. data suggest glycolytic regulatory enzymes disaccharidases susceptible insulin regulation.
