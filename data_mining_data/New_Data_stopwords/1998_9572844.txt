 Lysine 256, conserved amino acid Saccharomycescerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase located consensus kinase 1a sequence enzyme, changed alanine, arginine, glutamine site-directed mutagenesis. substitutions result gross changes protein structure, indicated circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, gel-exclusion chromatography. three variant enzymes showed almost unaltered Km MnADP 20 000-fold decrease Vmax PEP carboxylation reaction, compared wild-type PEP carboxykinase. variant enzymes presented oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity levels similar native protein; however, lacked pyruvate kinase-like activity. dissociation constant enzyme-MnATP complex 1.3 +/- 0.3 microM wild-type S. cerevisiae PEP carboxykinase, corresponding values Lys256Arg, Lys256Gln, Lys256Ala mutants 2.0 +/- 0.6 microM, 17 +/- 2 microM, 20 +/- 6 microM, respectively. results collectively show positively charged residue required proper binding MnATP Lys256 plays essential role transition state stabilization phosphoryl transfer S. cerevisiae PEP carboxykinase.
