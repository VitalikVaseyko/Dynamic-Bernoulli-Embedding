 High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) recently shown crucial late mediator inflammation sepsis, involved mediating multi-organ functional lesions, including acute lung, liver, intestine injuries. delayed inflammatory cytokine, HMGB1 provides wider therapeutic time window clinical intervention. HMGB1 proven promising therapeutic target prevent development multiple organ dysfunction syndrome experimental models severe sepsis. pharmacological strategies include neutralization antibodies specific HMGB1 antagonists, suppression HMGB1 secretion (ethyl pyruvate, agonists alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors), down-regulation HMGB1 expression (sodium butyrate, signaling inhibitors Janus kinase/signal transducer activator transcription).
