 Thymocytes induce glycolytic enzymes undergo transition resting proliferating state. Corresponding increases mRNA levels point transcriptional regulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed DNA-binding efficiency Sp1 increased nuclear extracts proliferating compared resting rat thymocytes used. demonstrate hydrogen peroxide, added nuclear extract proliferating cells, decreases Sp1 DNA-binding activity, whereas nuclear extracts resting cells dithioerythritol fully restores DNA-binding efficiency. Moreover show contrast resting thymocytes, production reactive peroxide anions upon priming phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate nearly abolished proliferating cells. results propose reactive oxygen intermediates affect interaction Sp1 transcription factor consensus sequence subsequently regulate glycolytic gene expression.
