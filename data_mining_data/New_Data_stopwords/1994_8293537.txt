 Male outbred Sprague-Dawley rats fed choline-deficient diet containing 0.1% w/w DL-ethionine (CDE) 22 weeks. expression pyruvate kinase isoenzymes L (L-PK) M2 (M2-PK) immunohistochemically analyzed liver slices rats killed 4, 10, 14 22 weeks starting treatment. M2-PK detected bile duct epithelial cells untreated rats proliferating oval cells, cholangiofibroses cholangiofibromas CDE-fed animals. Thus, M2-PK viewed positive marker bile duct epithelial/oval cell compartment. L-PK, parenchymal cell-specific protein untreated rat liver, present proliferating oval cells, consistently observed cells part ductal structures cholangiofibroses cholangiofibromas. Based morphology, L-PK-positive duct cells undoubtedly part bile duct epithelial cell lineage L-PK-positive hepatocyte-like cells observed ducts. Hence, study clearly shows mere presence liver parenchymal cell marker cells bile duct epithelial/oval cell compartment necessarily preclude cells undergoing differentiation preneoplastic parenchymal cells, previously suggested.
