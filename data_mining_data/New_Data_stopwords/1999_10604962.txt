 protective role metallothionein (MT) myocardiotoxicity hepatotoxicity doxorubicin (Dox) investigated mice. Dox-induced elevations plasma creatine kinase activity, measure myocardiac damage, plasma glutamate pyruvate transaminase activity, reflecting hepatic damage, prevented pretreatment MT inducer. Pretreatment zinc induced MT liver heart, thereby reducing Dox toxicity two organs. Pretratment n-hexane also induced MT reduced Dox toxicity, liver. primary hepatocyte cultures, leakage lactate dehydrogenase induced Dox prevented zinc pretreatment. results suggest MT induction prevents Dox toxicity vivo vitro. Furthermore, determined MT-null mice sensitive myocardiotoxic hepatotoxic effects Dox. findings indicate basal induced MT protect Dox toxicity.
