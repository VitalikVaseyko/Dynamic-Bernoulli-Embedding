 Brain function depends complex metabolic interactions among different cell types, astrocytes providing critical support neurons. Astrocyte functions include buffering extracellular space, providing substrates neurons, interchanging glutamate glutamine synaptic transmission neurons, facilitating access blood vessels. Whereas neurons possess highly oxidative metabolism easily succumb ischemia, astrocytes rely glycolytic metabolism hence less susceptible tolack oxygen. Astrocytoma cells seem retain basic metabolic mechanisms astrocytes; example, show high glycolytic rate, lactate extrusion, ability flourish hypoxia, opportunistic use mechanisms enhance cell division maintain growth. Differences metabolism neurons astrocytes may also extend astrocytoma cells, providing therapeutic opportunities astrocytomas, including sensitivity acetate, high rate glycolysis lactate extrusion, glutamate uptake transporters, differential sensitivities monocarboxylate transporters, presence glycogen, high interlinking gap junctions, use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate lipid synthesis, using different isoforms synthetic enzymes (e.g. isocitrate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), different glucose uptake mechanisms. unique metabolic susceptibilities may augment conventional therapeutic attacks based cell division differences surface receptors alone.
