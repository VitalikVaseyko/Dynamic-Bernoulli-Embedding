 Cancer cells activate biosynthesis saturated fatty acids (SFA) monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) order sustain increasing demand phospholipids appropriate acyl composition cell replication. previously shown stable knockdown stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), main Delta9-desaturase converts SFA MUFA, cancer cells decreases rate lipogenesis, reduces proliferation vitro invasiveness, dramatically impairs tumor formation growth. report pharmacological inhibition SCD1 novel small molecule cancer cells promoted activation AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) subsequent reduction acetylCoA carboxylase activity, concomitant inhibition glucose-mediated lipogenesis. pharmacological inhibition AMPK decreased proliferation SCD1-depleted cells, whereas AMPK activation restored proliferation control levels. Addition supraphysiological concentrations glucose pyruvate, end product glycolysis, reverse low proliferation rate SCD1-ablated cancer cells. data suggest cancer cells require active SCD1 control rate glucose-mediated lipogenesis, SCD1 activity impaired cells downregulate SFA synthesis via AMPK-mediated inactivation acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus preventing harmful effects SFA accumulation.
