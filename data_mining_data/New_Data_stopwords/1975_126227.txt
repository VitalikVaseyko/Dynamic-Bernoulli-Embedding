 mutant Neurospora crassa able grow liquid minimal glycerol medium without evidence conidiation high cell yields isolated shown allelic ff-1. glycerol-specific induction glycerokinase glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase similar wild-type mutant cells, although higher specific activities well higher glycerokinase cross-reacting material levels found fully induced mutant cells. growth minimal glycerol medium significant reduction wild-type cells activities pyruvate dehydrogenase dihydrolipoyl transacetylase. evidence indicates relationship conditional acetate requirement wild-type cells grown glycerol medium levels pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
