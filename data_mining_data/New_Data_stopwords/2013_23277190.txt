 Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) heart-targeting cytokine increased metabolic syndrome due overexpression adipocytes. effects CT-1 cardiomyocyte substrate metabolism remain unknown. therefore determined effects CT-1 basal stimulated glucose transport cardiomyocytes exposed low dose (1nM) high dose (10nM). Dose-response curves insulin showed 1nM CT-1 reduced insulin responsiveness, 10nM CT-1 increased insulin responsiveness. either condition insulin sensitivity unaffected. Similarly 1nM CT-1 reduced stimulation glucose transport response metabolic stress, induced mitochondrial poison oligomycin, 10nM CT-1 increased response. Reduction stimulated glucose transport 1nM CT-1 associated overexpression SOCS-3, protein known hinder proximal insulin signaling, increased phosphorylation STAT5. cardiomyocytes exposed 1nM CT-1 also reduced phosphorylation Akt AS160 response insulin, AMPK response oligomycin. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport signaling restored inhibition STAT5 activity. hand cardiomyocytes exposed 10nM CT-1 increased phosphorylation AS160 Akt response insulin. importantly, basal oligomycin-stimulated phosphorylation AMPK markedly increased cardiomyocytes exposed 10nM CT-1. enhancement basal stimulated-glucose transport abolished cardiomyocytes treated calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN93, AMPK phosphorylation. suggests activation CaMKII mediates activation AMPK high dose CT-1 independently metabolic stress. results point role CT-1 regulation myocardial glucose metabolism implicate entirely separate mechanisms inhibitory stimulatory effects CT-1 glucose transport low high concentrations respectively.
