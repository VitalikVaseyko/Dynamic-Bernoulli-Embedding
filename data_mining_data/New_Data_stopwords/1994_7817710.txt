 Pyruvate kinase (PK) four patients moderate severe congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia characterized methods recommended ICSH. possibility two patients true homozygotes cannot ruled out, two apparently represent double heterozygotes. one levels PK activity 44 65% normal. variant enzymes designed 'PK Pontos', 'PK Macedonia', 'PK Athens' 'PK Larisa'. Multiple physicochemical well kinetic aberrations detected variants. altered kinetic behaviour discussed terms concerted transition model allosteric enzymes abnormal properties compared known variants, also attempted correlate possible mechanisms resulting chronic haemolytic anaemia.
