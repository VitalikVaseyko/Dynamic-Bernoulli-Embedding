 Oxidative stress compromises tight junction, mechanisms underlying recovery remain unclear. developed model oxidative stress reversibly disrupts tight junction. Exposure Madin-Darby canine kidney cells hydrogen peroxide markedly reduced transepithelial resistance disrupted staining patterns tight junction proteins ZO-1 occludin. changes reversed catalase. short-term reassembly tight junctions dependent new protein synthesis, suggesting recovery occurs re-utilization existing proteins. Although ATP levels reduced, reduction insufficient explain observed changes, since comparable reduction ATP levels (with 2-deoxy-D-glucose) induce changes. intracellular hydrogen peroxide scavenger pyruvate protected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells loss transepithelial resistance heavy metal scavenger N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. wide variety agents examined, tyrosine kinase inhibitors protein kinase C inhibitors markedly inhibited tight junction reassembly. reassembly, tyrosine phosphorylation near lateral membrane, detected immunofluorescence. tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein PP-2 inhibited recovery transepithelial resistance perturbed relocalization ZO-1 occludin tight junction, indicating tyrosine kinases, possibly members Src family, critical reassembly oxidative stress.
