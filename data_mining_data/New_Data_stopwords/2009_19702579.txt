 average, human gene approximately four SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) coding region, half nsSNPs (non-synonymous SNPs) missense SNPs. Current attention focused known perturb function strongly linked disease. However, vast majority SNPs investigated possibility causing disease. set assess fraction nsSNPs encode proteins altered stability activity, class variants would candidates perturb cellular function. tested thermostability and, possible, catalytic activity common variant (wild-type) minor variants (total 46 SNPs) 16 human enzymes three-dimensional structures known. significant differences stability almost half variants (48%) compared wild-type counterparts. catalytic efficiency approx. 14 variants significantly altered, including several variants human PKM2 (pyruvate kinase muscle 2). Two PKM2 variants, S437Y E28K, also exhibited changes allosteric regulation compared wild-type enzyme. high proportion nsSNPs affect protein stability function, albeit subtly, underscores need experimental analysis diverse human proteome.
