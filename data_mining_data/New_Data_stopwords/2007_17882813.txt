 purpose study investigate significance tumor marker pyruvate kinase Tumor M2 (Tu M2-PK), diagnostics, monitoring treatment, evaluation effectiveness patients lung cancer (LC). isoform glycosile enzyme pyruvate kinase, existing active dimer less active tetramer. expression less active form typical tumor cells; blood level measured. subjects study 140 patients LC various histologic types. Serum levels certain tumor markers (Cyfra 21-1, NSE, SCC, Tu M2-PK) measured; Tu M2-PK level determined ELISA test ScheBoTech, two-stage sandwich immunoassay using one type antibodies. marker concentration also determined 195 healthy volunteers (control group.) maximum concentration Tu M2-PK 12.9 U/ml, determined 95% specificity. 78% patients small-cell carcinoma, 73% patients adenocarcinoma, 81% patients non-small cell lung carcinoma displayed increase Tu M2-PK serum concentration; concentration within normal limits patients nonmalignant diseases (e.g. bronchitis tuberculosis). Thus, patients lung carcinoma display pathologic increase Tu M2-P level. Measurement Tu M2-P may useful patients suspected LC; marker may greater diagnostic significance SCC NSE.
