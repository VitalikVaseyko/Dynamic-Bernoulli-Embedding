 Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) major enzyme glucose metabolism. Dichloroacetate (DCA) noncompetitive inhibitor PDHC kinase, enzyme inactivates PDHC. examined effects DCA extracellular lactate pyruvate concentration changes spinal somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) ischemic rabbit spinal cords. first group 26 animals, aorta occluded postsynaptic SSEP waves completely suppressed 10 min, period ischemia causes neurologic deficits 50% untreated animals. DCA (25 mg/kg) given 13 animals ischemia. second group 24 animals, aorta occluded postsynaptic SSEP waves absent 20 min, period ischemia produces paraplegia 100% untreated animals. DCA (25 mg/kg) given 16 animals aortic occlusion released. occlusion, extracellular spinal lactate concentrations increased abruptly pyruvate concentrations fell. lactate pyruvate concentrations reached plateau ischemic period increased aortic balloon deflated. DCA-treated animals lower lactate pyruvate peak concentrations reperfusion, well rapid greater recovery SSEP 2 h reperfusion. DCA alter spinal metabolism ischemia appeared produce rapid shift glucose metabolism reperfusion. Thus, DCA treatment resulted better electrophysiological recovery moderate severe ischemia, either reducing lactic acidosis increasing recovery rate aerobic energy production.
