 cancer cells exhibit elevated levels glycolysis metabolic pathway seems related greater glucose uptake. phenomenon, known Warburg effect, considered one fundamental metabolic alterations malignant transformation. Originally, Warburg hypothesised aerobic glycolysis cancer cells could aspect complex metabolic adaptation. However, intriguing discovery partially misinterpreted disregarded time. recent years, peculiarities cancer cell metabolism re-evaluated light new metabolic data seem confirm widen original concept Warburg effect. fact, biochemical, molecular, and, all, proteomic studies multifaceted roles glycolytic enzymes cancer cells general, cancer stem cells particular, seem suggest complex functional adaptations. adaptations result significantly altered protein expression patterns, fundamental implications diagnosis, prognosis therapy. Revisiting Warburg effect cancer cells proteomic approach could deepen knowledge cancer cell metabolism cancer cell biology general. Moreover, identifying useful diagnostic, prognostic therapeutic targets, could significantly impact clinical practice.
