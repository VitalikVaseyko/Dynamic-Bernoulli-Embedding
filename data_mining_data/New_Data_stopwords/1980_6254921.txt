 enzyme assay red blood cells, three problems related membrane structure examined. (1) difficult get full activity membrane enzymes, especially ATPases. effects various buffers substrates conditions preservation examined. (2) preservation blood, phosphofructokinase (PFK) decreased among 15 enzymes including glycolytic enzymes. decrease prevented addition adenine inosine produce ATP inside cells. hemolysis, PFK decreased rapidly, too. ATP prevented inactivation effectively. (3) centrifugation, even according Murphy's method, pyruvate kinase decreased lowest layer stacked erythrocytes. might due effect centrifugation.
