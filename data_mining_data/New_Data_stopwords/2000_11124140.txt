 test predictions biochemical symmorphosis, measured activity seven consecutive glycolytic enzymes three positions along heterothermic white muscle bluefin tuna. Biochemical symmorphosis predicts adjustments sequential enzyme concentrations along thermal gradient occur function thermal sensitivity enzymes ensure one enzyme pathway excess point along gradient. found evidence adjustments enzyme quantity quality along thermal gradient, well evidence prediction temperature-sensitive enzymes would exhibit dramatic compensation. Conservation glycolytic flux cold exterior warm interior muscle may achieved near insensitivity glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase temperature tissue. may added benefit moderating flux seasonal transient changes thermal gradient. According strictest application biochemical symmorphosis, mechanism represents adequate, yet suboptimal design.
