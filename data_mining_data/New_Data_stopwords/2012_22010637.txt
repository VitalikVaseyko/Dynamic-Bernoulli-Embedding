 Chickens randomly bred genetic line segregated high low growth rates high low water-holding capacities (WHCs). objective study identify protein markers associated slow fast growth rates low high WHCs water-soluble protein (WSP) crude myofibrillar protein (CMP) extracts chicken breast muscle. Proteins fractionated using two-dimensional electrophoresis, total 22 protein spots selected, excised, analyzed in-gel tryptic digestion matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Proteins expressed extracts slow fast growth rates low high WHCs included metabolic enzymes, creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, ubiqitin; housekeeping proteins, heat shock protein; contractile proteins, myosin heavy chain; actin; also MHC isoforms actin isoforms. mass spectra 20 protein spots significantly matched (protein score >83; P < 0.05) online database. CMP, unique proteins present fast-growth population: gi|118099530 , gi|20664362 , gi|71895043 , gi|114794125 , gi|297343122 , gi|71895043 . information identified protein markers associated growth rate water holding capacity. protein markers could added chicken database.
