 recently established various brain regions D-serine, product serine racemase, occupies so-called 'glycine site' within N-methyl D-aspartate receptors. Mammalian brain serine racemase pyridoxal-5' phosphate-containing enzyme catalyzes racemization L-serine D-serine. also shown catalyze alpha,beta-elimination water L-serine D-serine form pyruvate ammonia. Serine racemase included within group type II-fold pyridoxal-5' phosphate enzymes, together many racemases dehydratases. Serine racemase first purified rat brain homogenates later recombinantly expressed mammalian insect cells well Escherichia coli. shown serine racemase activated divalent cations like calcium, magnesium manganese, well nucleotides like ATP, ADP GTP. turn, serine racemase also strongly inhibited reagents react free sulfhydryl groups glutathione. Several yeast two-hybrid screens interaction partners identified proteins glutamate receptor interacting protein, protein interacting C kinase 1 Golga3 bind serine racemase, different effects catalytic activity stability. addition, also proposed serine racemase regulated phosphorylation. Thus, d-serine production brain tightly regulated various factors pointing physiologic importance. minireview, focus regulation brain serine racemase d-serine synthesis factors mentioned above.
