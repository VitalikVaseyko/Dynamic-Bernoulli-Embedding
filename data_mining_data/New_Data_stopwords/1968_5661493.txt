 paper describes new characteristics phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase CO(2)-oxaloacetate exchange reaction purified preparations Rhodospirillum rubrum. enzymatic activity purified 169-fold. Nucleotide diphosphates substitute nucleotide triphosphates exchange reaction. Nucleotide diphosphates support synthesis phosphoenolpyruvate oxaloacetate. reaction differs significantly CO(2)-oxaloacetate exchange reaction higher plants animals.
