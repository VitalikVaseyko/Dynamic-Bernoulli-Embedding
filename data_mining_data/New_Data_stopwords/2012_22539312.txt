 Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent kinases central numerous metabolic processes mediate production adenosine triphosphate (ATP) substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP). pyruvate kinase (PK, EC: 2.7.1.40), final enzyme glycolytic pathway critical anaerobic synthesis ATP ADP, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK, EC: 2.7.9.1), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PEPS, EC: 2.7.9.2) help generate ATP AMP coupled PEP substrate. demonstrate inexpensive effective electrophoretic technology determine activities enzymes blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). generation pyruvate linked exogenous lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), oxidation reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) coupled 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT) results formazan precipitate easily quantifiable. selectivity enzymes ensured including either AMP ADP pyrophosphate (PP(i) ) inorganic phosphate (P(i) ). Activity bands readily obtained incubation respective reaction mixtures 20-30 min. Cell-free extract concentrations low 20 mug protein equivalent yielded activity bands substrate levels manipulated optimize sensitivity analytical technique. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), two-dimensional (2-D) SDS-PAGE (where SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate), immunoblot studies excised activity band help characterize PEP-dependent kinases. Furthermore, enzymes readily identified gel incubating sequentially respective reaction mixtures. technique provides facile method elucidate kinases biological systems.
