 cDNA gene encodes human cytosolic thyroid hormone binding protein (p58) recently isolated sequenced. Analysis p58 sequence indicates identical subunit pyruvate kinase, subtype M2. situ hybridization, gene p58 mapped 15q24-25. localization shows p58 gene linked L-type pyruvate kinase, located chromosome 1. p58 gene found activated several forms cancer. Current localization permit us assess effect alterations involving chromosome 15 structure activity p58 gene neoplasms chromosome syndromes.
