 Pyruvate kinase deficiency found causative factor family nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Biochemical findings following: decrease adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) concentration (59 micromoles per 100 ml erytrocytes; normal: 150 +/- 59), increase 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration (13611 micromoles per 100 ml erythrocytes; normal: 480 +/- 80) low level pyruvate kinase activity (955 U) mmol Hb; normal 2700 +/- 498. deficiency enzyme activity hexose-monophosphate shunt excluded bases normal elevated glucose-6-phosphate 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities, normal reduced glutathione concentration normal glutathione stability vitro. Michaelis constant phosphoenolpyruvate patient's pyruvate kinase found normal; thus, mutation affected Vmax enzyme.
