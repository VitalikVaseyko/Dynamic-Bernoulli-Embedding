 Here, developed model system evaluate metabolic effects oncogene(s) host microenvironment. matched set "normal" oncogenically transformed epithelial cell lines co-cultured human fibroblasts, determine "bystander" effects oncogenes stromal cells. ROS production glucose uptake measured FACS analysis. addition, expression panel metabolic protein biomarkers (Caveolin-1, MCT1, MCT4) analyzed parallel. Interestingly, oncogene activation cancer cells sufficient induce metabolic reprogramming cancer-associated fibroblasts toward glycolysis, via oxidative stress. Evidence "metabolic symbiosis" oxidative cancer cells glycolytic fibroblasts provided MCT1/4 immunostaining. such, oncogenes drive establishment stromal-epithelial "lactate-shuttle", fuel anabolic growth cancer cells. Similar results obtained two divergent oncogenes (RAS NFkappaB), indicating ROS production inflammation metabolically converge tumor stroma, driving glycolysis upregulation MCT4. findings make stromal MCT4 attractive target new drug discovery, MCT4 shared endpoint metabolic effects many oncogenic stimuli. Thus, diverse oncogenes stimulate common metabolic response tumor stroma. Conversely, also show fibroblasts protect cancer cells oncogenic stress senescence reducing ROS production tumor cells. Ras-transformed cells also able metabolically reprogram normal adjacent epithelia, indicating cancer cells use either fibroblasts epithelial cells "partners" metabolic symbiosis. antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) selectively halted mitochondrial biogenesis Ras-transformed cells, normal epithelia. NAC also blocked stromal induction MCT4, indicating NAC effectively functions "MCT4 inhibitor". Taken together, data provide new strategies achieving effective anticancer therapy. conclude oncogenes enable cancer cells behave selfish "metabolic parasites", like foreign organisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses). Thus, consider treating cancer like infectious disease, new classes metabolically targeted "antibiotics" selectively starve cancer cells. results provide new support "seed soil" hypothesis, first proposed 1889 English surgeon, Stephen Paget.
