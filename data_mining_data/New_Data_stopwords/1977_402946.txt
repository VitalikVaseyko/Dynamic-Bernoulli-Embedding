 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-0-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) purified 40 000 times human erythrocytes, according original method. whole purification procedure included toluene extraction, ammonium sulphate fractionation, DEAE-Sephadex batchwise chromatography affinity chromatography Dextran Blue-Sepharose column specific elution fructose 1,6-diphosphate. final preparation specific activity 290 I.U./mg proteins overall yield 30%. Pyruvate kinase showed one protein band judged sodium dodecyl sulphate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pure enzyme injected rabbits monospecific antiserum obtained able neutralize, per ml, 150 I.U. erythocyte-type pyruvate kinase well L-type enzyme. L-type erythrocyte-type pyruvate kinases showed reactions complete identity tested immunodiffusion anti-erythrocyte type pyruvate kinase sera; cases single precipitation line could detected. L-type pyruvate kinase mixed anti-erythocyte pyruvate kinase serum suppressed ability antiserum react immunological erythocyte enzyme. Finally microcomplement fixation curves using anti-erythrocyte pyruvate kinase serum identical erythrocyte L-type enzymes. results appeared antigenic difference L-type erythocyte enzyme could detected. Consequently likely hypothesis enzymes coded single gene, slight electrophoretic differences due post-synthetic tissue-specific changes.
