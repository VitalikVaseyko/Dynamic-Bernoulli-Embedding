 hormonal regulation L-type pyruvate kinase hepatocytes phosphorylase b kinase-deficient (gsd/gsd) rats investigated. Adrenaline (10 microM) glucagon (10 nM) led inactivation phosphorylation pyruvate kinase. Dose-response curves adrenaline-mediated inactivation pyruvate kinase, phosphorylation pyruvate kinase stimulation gluconeogenesis 1.8 mM-lactate similar hepatocytes control gsd/gsd rats. Time-course studies indicated adrenaline-mediated inactivation phosphorylation pyruvate kinase proceeded slowly phosphorylase kinase-deficient hepatocytes control hepatocytes. age-dependent change adrenergic control pyruvate kinase similar control phosphorylase kinase-deficient hepatocytes. Adrenaline, glucagon noradrenaline activated cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibited pyruvate kinase phosphorylase kinase-deficient hepatocytes. Vasopressin (0.2-2 nM), angiotensin (10nM) A23187 (10 microM) effect activity ratio cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase pyruvate kinase cells. concluded phosphorylase kinase plays significant role hormonal control pyruvate kinase phosphorylation inactivation enzyme results predominantly action cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.
