 occurrence Crabtree effect HeLa cells detected. properties pyruvate kinase (PK) also evaluated. Hexose phosphate, triose-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) significantly decreased oxygen consumption digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells, oxidizing succinate. Crabtree effect promoted PEP concentration-dependent lowered increase ADP concentration, suggesting participation PK. dependence fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FDP) HeLa cell PK observed. PK HeLa cells inhibited L-alanine absence FDP, presence metabolite, increase activity observed. PK also inhibited presence L-histidine L-leucine, L-serine promoted activation. L-Cysteine L-phenylalanine also inhibited PK HeLa cells. This, together sigmoidal character relation substrate concentration, suggests presence K-type PK HeLa cells.
