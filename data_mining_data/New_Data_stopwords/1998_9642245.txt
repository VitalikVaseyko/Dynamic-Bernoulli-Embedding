 previously reported (Previs, S. F., Fernandez, C. A., Yang, D., Soloviev, M. V., David, F., Brunengraber, H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19806-19815) glucose made isolated livers starved rats perfused physiological concentrations lactate, pyruvate, either [2-13C]- [U-13C3]glycerol mass isotopomer distribution incompatible glucose made homogeneously labeled pool triose phosphates. Similar data obtained live rats infused [U-13C3]glycerol. ascribed labeling heterogeneity major decreases glycerol concentration enrichment across liver. concluded [13C]glycerol unsuitable tracing contribution gluconeogenesis total glucose production. report isotopic heterogeneity gluconeogenesis hepatocytes, even cells contact identical concentrations enrichments gluconeogenic substrates. Total rat hepatocytes incubated concentrations glycerol, lactate, pyruvate kept constant substrate infusions. modulate competition substrates, (glycerol)/(lactate + pyruvate) infusion ratio ranged 0.23 3. 60. Metabolic isotopic steady states achieved cases. apparent contribution gluconeogenesis glucose production (f) calculated mass isotopomer distribution glucose. substrates 13C-labeled, f 97%, expected glycogen-deprived hepatocytes. infusion ratio ([13C]glycerol)/(lactate + pyruvate) increased, f increased 73% 94%. contrast, infusion ratio (glycerol)/([13C]lactate + [13C]pyruvate) increased, f decreased 93% 76%. cases, f increased rate supply substrate labeled. Variations f show 13C labeling triose phosphates equal hepatocytes, even exposed substrate concentrations enrichments. also showed zonation glycerol kinase activity minor rat liver. conclude zonation processes glycerol phosphorylation contributes heterogeneity triose phosphate labeling glycerol rat liver.
