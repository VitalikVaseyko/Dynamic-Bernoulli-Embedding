 Type 2 diabetes characterized hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance. aim study investigate whether acute hyperlipidemia-induced insulin resistance presence hyperinsulinemia due defective insulin signaling. Hyperinsulinemia (approximately 300 mU/l) hyperlipidemia glycerol (control) produced cannulated male Wistar rats 0.5, 1 h, 3 h, 5 h. glucose infusion rate required maintain euglycemia significantly reduced 3 h lipid infusion reduced 5 h infusion, difference plasma insulin levels, indicating development insulin resistance. Consistent finding, vivo skeletal muscle glucose uptake (31%, P < 0.05) glycogen synthesis rate (38%, P < 0.02) significantly reduced 5 h compared 3 h lipid infusion. Despite development insulin resistance, difference phosphorylation state multiple insulin-signaling intermediates muscle diacylglyceride ceramide content time course. However, increase cumulative exposure long-chain acyl-CoA (70%) lipid infusion. Interestingly, although muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 protein content decreased hyperinsulinemic glycerol-infused rats, decrease blunted muscle hyperinsulinemic lipid-infused rats. Decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity also observed lipid- insulin-infused animals (43%). Overall, results suggest acute reductions muscle glucose metabolism rats hyperlipidemia hyperinsulinemia likely result substrate competition significant early defect insulin action signaling.
