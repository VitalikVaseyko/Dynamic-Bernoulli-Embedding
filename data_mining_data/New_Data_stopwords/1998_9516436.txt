 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase intrinsic ATPase activity nucleic acid (poly(rU))-stimulated ATPase activity. poly(rU)-stimulated ATPase activity inhibited F- time-dependent manner ATP hydrolysis. Inhibition result trapping enzyme-bound ADP-poly(rU) ternary complex generated catalytic cycle result generating enzyme-free ADP subsequently inhibited enzyme. However, catalysis required efficient inhibition F-. stimulated intrinsic ATPase activities also inhibited treatment enzyme F-, ADP, poly(rU). inhibited enzyme slowly recovered (t1/2 = 23 min) ATPase activity 2000-fold dilution assay buffer. onset inhibition 500 microM ADP 15 mM F- absence nucleic acid slow (t1/2 > 40 min). However, sequence addition poly(rU) diluted solution ADP/NaF-treated enzyme profound effect extent inhibition. ADP/NaF-treated enzyme diluted assay lacked poly(rU) assay subsequently initiated poly(rU), treated enzyme inhibited. Alternatively, treated enzyme diluted assay containing poly(rU), enzyme inhibited. ATP protected enzyme inhibition ADP/NaF. stoichiometry ADP enzyme monomer inhibited enzyme complex 2, determined titration ATPase activity ([ADP]/[E] = 2.2) number radiolabeled ADP bound inhibited enzyme ([ADP]/[E] = 1.7) presence excess NaF, MgCl2, poly(rU). Hill coefficient titration ATPase activity F- (n = 2.8) MgCl2 (n = 2.1) presence excess ADP poly(rU) suggested multiple F- Mg2+ involved forming inhibited enzyme complex. stoichiometry (dU)18, defined oligomeric nucleic acid substituting poly(rU), enzyme monomer inhibited enzyme complex estimated 1 ([(dU)18/[E] = 1.2) titration ATPase activity presence excess ADP, MgCl2, NaF.
