 Interrelationships binding rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase citrate, ATP, GTP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) investigated. allow measurements 25 degrees C, pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate included dialysis media rephosphorylate ADP formed weak ATPase action phosphofructokinase. Binding citrate enhanced GTP nearly much ATP, although GTP inhibit catalytic activity enzyme. results consistent interpretation binding GTP, and, analogy, ATP, catalytic site enhances binding citrate. AMP-PNP also enhanced citrate binding. ATP GTP appear bind three sites per enzyme subunit, apparent third site binding relatively weakly. estimated dissociation constants first two sites, 33 microM ATP compared 3 280 microM GTP, consistent kinetic results imply lack effective competition GTP inhibitory site. compound binds two sites macromolecule, position shape binding curve sensitive geometric mean binding constants quite insensitive magnitudes individual constants; thus, binding affinities cannot estimated confidence cases.
