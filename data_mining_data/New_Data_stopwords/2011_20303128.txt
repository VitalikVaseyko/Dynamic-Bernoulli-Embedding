 Nicotinic acid (NA; niacin) used hypolipidemic agent 4 decades. However, mechanisms underlying effects NA treatment (wanted unwanted) still poorly understood. present study, discovered NA infusion rats resulted dephosphorylation (ie, activation) forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 insulin-sensitive tissues skeletal cardiac muscles, liver, adipose tissue. NA effects opposite effects insulin increase FOXO1 phosphorylation. test whether NA alters gene expression tissues, rats infused 7 hours NA (30 mumol/h) and/or insulin (5 mU/[kg min]); gene expression evaluated using microarray analysis. Nicotinic acid widespread effects gene expression tissues studied, number genes affected NA greatly exceeded genes affected insulin. systematic (or strategic) analysis microarray data revealed numerous genes whose expression regulated inversely insulin NA correlation FOXO1 phosphorylation, representing potential FOXO1 target genes. also identified group genes whose expression altered NA exclusively adipose tissue, presumably stimulation NA receptor tissue. Finally, genes whose expression altered NA insulin, likely via lowering plasma free fatty acid levels, including lipoprotein lipase adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette A1, play major role regulation circulating lipids. Thus, data suggest NA alters gene expression insulin-sensitive tissues various mechanisms. NA-induced changes gene expression discussed potential mechanisms underlying wanted unwanted effects NA treatment.
