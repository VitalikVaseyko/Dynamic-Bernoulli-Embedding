 Ca2+ ions biphasic effect allosteric pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) human erythrocytes: Ca2+ activator low phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentrations: increased PEP concentrations Ca2+ behaves inhibitor. presence ATP effect observed low PEP concentrations Ca2+ ions completely abolish ATP inhibitory effect. high Ca2+ concentrations loss cooperativity towards PEP. enzyme activated fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) inhibited Ca2+ ions concentrations PEP tested. Mg2+ ions able counteract activation Ca2+ ions low PEP concentrations. results interpreted basis model Monod.
