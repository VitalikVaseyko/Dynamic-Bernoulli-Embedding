 high proliferation rate tumor cells demands high energy metabolites sustained high glycolytic flux known 'Warburg effect'. activation metabolism glucose initiated hexokinase, focal point metabolic regulation. human hexokinase 2 (HK2) overexpressed aggressive tumors predominantly found outer mitochondrial membrane, interactions N-terminus initiates maintains tumorigenesis. Here, report structure HK2 complex glucose glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Structural biochemical characterization mitochondrial conformation reveals higher conformational stability slow protein unfolding rate (ku) compared cytosolic conformation. Despite active site similarity human hexokinases, N-domain HK2 catalytically active hexokinase 1 3. Helix-alpha13 protrudes N-domain link C-domain HK2 found important maintaining catalytic activity N-half. addition, N-domain HK2 regulates stability whole enzyme contrast C-domain. Glucose binding enhanced stability wild-type (WT) enzyme single mutant D657A C-domain, increase stability D209A mutant N-domain. interaction HK2 mitochondria N-half proposed facilitate higher stability mitochondria. identification structural biochemical differences HK2 human hexokinase isozymes could potentially used development new anticancer therapies.
