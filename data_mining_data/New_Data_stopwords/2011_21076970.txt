 synchronized conditions daily rhythms run precise phase relationships. Long lasting shift-work disturbs circadian rhythms causes metabolism dysfunction. result frequent shifts light (L):dark (D) cycle circadian system adjust new regimen repeatedly, organism never achieve complete adjustment circadian rhythms. Nuclear receptor PPARalpha supposed functional interface circadian clock metabolism, interconnection rev-erbalpha pdk4 proven. aim study elucidate responsiveness circadian system LD cycle mimicking rotating shift-work 8-h phase delay every second day. Expression key clock genes clock controlled metabolic genes rev-erbalpha, pparalpha, pdk4 analyzed liver heart rats real time PCR. Control Wistar rats exposed regular LD cycle 12:12. second group exposed LD regimen mimicking shift-work 8-h phase delays period 10 weeks. Sampling performed 4-h intervals 24-h cycle. Clock gene expression heart liver shifted rats rhythmic phase delayed 8-9 h compared control. Expression metabolic genes influenced liver heart. Results indicate frequent shifts LD cycle may interfere control lipid metabolism.
