 Nitric oxide (NO) omnipresent regulator cell function variety physiologic pathophysiologic states. part, exerts actions S-nitrosylation target thiols, primarily cysteine residues. Delineating functional correlates S-nitrosylation begin identification entire population S-nitrososylated proteins. Recently, biotin switch technique developed allow proteomic approach identification "universe" S-nitrsoylated proteins. study using endotoxin-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophages, utilized biotin-switch technique protein sequencing identify S-nitrosylated proteins setting. contrast studies utilizing exogenous sources NO, approach utilizes endogenous synthesis basis S-nitrosylation. results indicate multiple unique proteins previously identified S-nitrosylation targets: enolase, pyruvate kinase, elongation factor-1 -2, plastin-2, FRAG-6, CEM-16, SMC-6. ubiquitous nature argues degrees commonality, S-nitrosylation unique proteins specific endotoxin stimulated macrophages suggests regulatory mechanisms necessary, sufficient.
