 Poly U dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis 14C phenylalanyl-tRNA, known optimal conditions, ribosomes obtained NaF-treated Rabbit reticulocytes, slightly stimulated addition ATP, GTP UTP absence phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. However, presence energy generating system, stimulation ATP far surpasses nucleotides. scheme reactions help explain observation presented.
