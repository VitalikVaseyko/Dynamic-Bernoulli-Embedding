 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) detected aquatic environment, little known either impact mode action aquatic organisms. tested hypothesis NSAIDs disrupt evolutionarily conserved heat shock response, critical defense stressor-mediated proteotoxicity, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trout fry exposed immersion range salicylate ibuprofen concentrations (1, 10, 100 1000 microg/L) 4d. Ibuprofen, salicylate, concentrations induced heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) trout liver. used highest concentration drugs investigate mode action heat shock response. Fry subjected standardized heat shock, 10 degrees C ambient (13 degrees C) 1h, temporal changes liver hsp70 mRNA protein content well glucose dynamics recovery heat stressor assessed. Ibuprofen exposure modify hsp70 mRNA abundance, significantly depressed heat shock-induced hsp70 protein expression liver gill trout. Salicylate exposure elevated hsp70 mRNA abundance delayed hsp70 expression heat shock. Liver glucose levels activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, elevated NSAIDs suggesting enhanced tissue glycolytic capacity. Effects whole body glucose dynamics, induced heat shock, either absent ibuprofen completely modified salicylate. Overall, NSAIDs disrupt heat shock response rainbow trout, mode action salicylate ibuprofen impacting cellular stress response appears distinct.
