 BACKGROUND: Dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibition aerobic glycolysis (the 'Warburg effect') promotion pyruvate oxidation, induces growth reduction many tumours undergoing several clinical trials. aerobic glycolysis active multiple myeloma (MM) cells, potentially targeted DCA induce myeloma growth inhibition. METHODS: Representative multiple myeloma cell lines myeloma-bearing mice treated DCA, alone combination bortezomib. RESULTS: found aerobic glycolysis occurs approximately half MM cell lines examined, producing average 1.86-fold lactate phorbol myristate acetate stimulated-peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated low-oxidative capacity. Lower doses DCA (5-10 mM) suppressed aerobic glycolysis improved cellular respiration associated activation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Higher doses DCA (10-25 mM) induced superoxide production, apoptosis, suppressed proliferation G0/1 G2M phase arrest MM cell lines. addition, DCA increased MM cell line sensitivity bortezomib, combinatorial treatment agents improved survival myeloma-bearing mice. CONCLUSION: Myeloma cells display aerobic glycolysis DCA may complement clinically used MM therapies inhibit disease progression.
