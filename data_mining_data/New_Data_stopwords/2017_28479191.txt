 applied isotopically nonstationary (13)C metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA) compare pathway fluxes wild-type (WT) Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 engineered strain (SA590) produces isobutyraldehyde (IBA). flux maps revealed potential bottleneck pyruvate kinase (PK) reaction step associated diversion flux three-step PK bypass pathway involving enzymes PEP carboxylase (PEPC), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), malic enzyme (ME). Overexpression pk SA590 led significant improvement IBA specific productivity. Single-gene overexpression three enzymes proposed PK bypass pathway also led improvements IBA production, although lesser extent pk overexpression. Combinatorial overexpression two three genes proposed PK bypass pathway (mdh me) led improvements specific productivity similar achieved single-gene pk overexpression. work demonstrates (13)C flux analysis used identify potential metabolic bottlenecks novel metabolic routes, findings guide rational metabolic engineering cyanobacteria increased production desired molecules.
