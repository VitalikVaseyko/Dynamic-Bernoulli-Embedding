 Pancreatic cancer 5-year survival rate less 4%. Despite advances diagnostic technology, pancreatic cancer continues diagnosed late incurable stage. Accurate biomarkers early diagnosis predict treatment response urgently needed. Since alteration glucose metabolism one hallmarks cancer cells, proposed pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) enzymes could represent novel diagnostic markers potential therapeutic targets pancreatic cancer. 266 tissue sections normal pancreas, pancreatic cystic neoplasms, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) cancer, evaluated expression PKM2, LDHA, Ki-67 CD8+ immunohistochemistry correlated markers clinicopathological characteristics patient survival. PKM2 LDHA expression also assessed Western blot 10 human pancreatic cancer cell lines. PKM2 expression increased progressively cyst PanIN cancer, whereas LDHA overexpressed throughout carcinogenic process. one cell line showed high expression proteins. Patients strong PKM2 LDHA expression significantly worse survival weak PKM2 and/or LDHA expression (7.0 months vs. 27.9 months, respectively, p = 0.003, log rank test). expression PKM2 LDHA correlated directly Ki-67 expression, inversely intratumoral CD8+ cell count. PKM2 significantly overexpressed poorly differentiated tumours PKM2 LDHA overexpressed larger tumours. Multivariable analysis showed combined expression PKM2 LDHA independent poor prognostic marker survival. conclusion, results demonstrate high expression pattern two major glycolytic enzymes pancreatic carcinogenesis, increased expression aggressive tumours significant adverse effect survival.
