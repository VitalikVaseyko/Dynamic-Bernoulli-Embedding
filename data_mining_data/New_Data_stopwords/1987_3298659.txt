 propose way proteins fold affected rates regions polypeptide chains translated vivo. Furthermore, suggest gene sequences evolved control rate translational elongation synthesis defined portions polypeptide chains separated temporally. stress many proteins capable folding efficiently native conformations without help differential translation rates. proteins amino acid sequence indeed contain information needed polypeptide chain fold correctly (even vitro, denaturation). However, proteins clearly fold efficiently native conformation vitro. argue efficiency folding problematic proteins vivo may improved controlled synthesis nascent polypeptide.
