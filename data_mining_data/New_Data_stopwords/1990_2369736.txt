 recent years, reported isozyme shift pyruvate kinase M- toward K-type human neuroectodermal tumors. investigate whether shift enables phosphorylation pyruvate kinase tumors, studied 29 different specimens human brain tumors endogenous pyruvate kinase phosphorylation. normal human brain phosphorylation pyruvate kinase detected, brain tumors pyruvate kinase became phosphorylated. correlation extent pyruvate kinase phosphorylation histological classification grading pyruvate kinase isozyme composition tumors. pyruvate kinase type K, type M, served substrate phosphorylation reaction. phosphorylation pyruvate kinase could completely inhibited addition fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, positive effector pyruvate kinase type K; alanine, however, negative effector, phospho-enol-pyruvate, substrate pyruvate kinase reaction, effect. pyruvate kinase type L liver phosphorylated cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, incorporation phosphate pyruvate kinase human brain tumors appeared cyclic AMP independent occurred exclusively serine residues.
