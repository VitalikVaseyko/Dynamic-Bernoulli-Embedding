 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) plays key role regulation skeletal muscle substrate utilization. IL-6 produced skeletal muscle exercise duration dependent manner reported increase whole body fatty acid oxidation, muscle glucose uptake decrease PDHa activity skeletal muscle fed mice. aim present study examine whether muscle IL-6 contributes exercise-induced PDH regulation skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle-specific IL-6 knockout (IL-6 MKO) mice floxed littermate controls (control) completed single bout treadmill exercise 10, 60 120 min, rested mice genotype serving basal controls. respiratory exchange ratio (RER) overall higher (P<0.05) IL-6 MKO control mice 120 min treadmill exercise, RER decreased exercise independent genotype. AMPK ACC phosphorylation also increased exercise independent genotype. PDHa activity control mice higher (P<0.05) 10 60 min exercise rest remained unchanged IL-6 MKO mice. addition, PDHa activity higher (P<0.05) IL-6 MKO control mice rest 60 min exercise. Neither PDH phosphorylation acetylation could explain genotype differences PDHa activity. Together, provides evidence skeletal muscle IL-6 contributes regulation PDH rest prolonged exercise suggests muscle IL-6 normally dampens carbohydrate utilization prolonged exercise via effects PDH.
