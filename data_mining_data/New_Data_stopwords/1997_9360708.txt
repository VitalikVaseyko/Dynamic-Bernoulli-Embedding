 highest amount N-acetylneuraminic acid (AcNeu) found pyruvate kinase isoenzyme L normal rat liver (24 moles/mole enzyme tetramer), highest electrophoretic mobility. hand, isoenzyme M2 Morris hepatoma 7777, lowest electrophoretic mobility, lowest AcNeu content (5 moles/mole enzyme tetramer). tumour isoenzyme M2 pyruvate kinase was, however, characterised highest phosphate content (12 moles/mole protein), comparison isoenzyme L (3 moles/mole protein) normal liver isoenzyme M2 (6 moles/mole protein). could indicate regulatory change caused reversible enzyme phosphorylation dephosphorylation sialization desialization. Despite differences, sum two negatively charged residues lower tumour pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2, slowest migration rate, normal rat liver isoenzyme M2. Moreover, isoenzyme M2 tumour material, comparison isoenzyme M2 normal rat liver, twice high content thiol groups (20 moles/mole protein), especially free superficially located ones, isoenzyme M2 normal liver (10 moles/mole protein). may explain abnormal susceptibility tumour isoenzyme M2 stereospecific inhibition exogenous L-cysteine, indicate genetically dependent changes amino-acid content tumour enzyme take place cell tumourigenic transformation.
