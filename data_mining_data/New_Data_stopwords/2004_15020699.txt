 study examined effects short- long-term aerobic training stable up-regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) PDH kinase (PDK) human skeletal muscle. hypothesized 8 weeks, 1 week, aerobic training would increase total PDH (PDHt) PDK activities compared pretraining, would detectable level gene transcription (mRNA) and/or gene translation (protein). Resting muscle biopsies taken 1 8 weeks aerobic cycle exercise training. PDHt PDK activities, respective protein mRNA expression, differ 1 week aerobic training. PDHt activity increased 31% 8 weeks may partially due 1.3-fold increase PDH-E(1)alpha protein expression. PDK activity approximately doubled 8 weeks aerobic training attributed 1.3-fold increase PDK2 isoform protein expression. Similar 1 week, changes observed mRNA level 8 weeks training. findings suggest aerobically trained human skeletal muscle increased maximal capacity utilize carbohydrates, evident increased PDHt, increased metabolic control sensitivity pyruvate increased contribution PDK2 total PDK activity.
