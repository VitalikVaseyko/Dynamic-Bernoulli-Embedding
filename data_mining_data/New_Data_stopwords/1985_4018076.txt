 activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, phosphorylates thereby inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, stimulated malonyl-CoA. Treatment [2-14C]malonyl-CoA resulted acylation sites complex. acylation activation kinase activity increased time-dependent manner parallel increase activities malonyl-CoA:CoA ratio varied. Protein-bound acyl groups labilized performic acid treatment indicating attachment protein thiol residues; however, product released volatile, characteristic malonic acid. malonyl-CoA initially free acetyl-CoA, stimulation kinase activity acylation sites complex malonyl-CoA shown contingent upon enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation. Decarboxylation appeared catalyzed trace contaminant present highly purified preparations pyruvate 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. conditions free CoA removed (by conversion succinyl-CoA) then, various periods, free acetyl-CoA removed (by enzymic conversion acetyl phosphate), acetylation sites complex activation kinase activity increased time-dependent manner. Concomitantly decrease concentration dependence activation kinase malonyl-CoA. results strongly support conclusion activation kinase activity associated acylation sites complex, that, case malonyl-CoA, processes depend enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation.
