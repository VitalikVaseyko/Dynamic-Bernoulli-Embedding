 Epidemiological studies show increased risk developing liver cancer among alcoholics. agreement ethanol carcinogenic, may enhance tumorigenic process inducing drug-metabolizing enzymes, suppression immune system affecting DNA repair enzymes. Precisely ethanol predisposes promotes development hepatoma unknown. Hepatocarcinogenesis induced choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet produces extensive alteration liver architecture emergence rapid proliferation oval cells. study examines whether chronic alcohol consumption induces proliferation oval cells. Oval cells induced rats maintained 5% ethanol liquid diet (ELD) 24 months, fed CDE diet 4 weeks, compared using panel liver-specific markers. CDE-treated rats, oval cells staining positively alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), pi-class glutathione S-transferase (pi GST), embryonic form pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) observed 1 week. Similar cells seen ELD-treated rats 2 months. numbers increase time, incorporation [3H]thymidine confirms dividing population. Acute damage induced partial hepatectomy CCI4 poisoning induce appearance oval cells. conclude chronic ethanol consumption induces oval cell proliferation. suggest that, addition proposed mechanisms, alteration cellular composition liver considered explanation increased incidence liver cancer among alcoholics.
