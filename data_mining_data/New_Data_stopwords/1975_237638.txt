 Pyruvate kinase activity gastric mucosal supernatant preparations shows large responses exogenous effectors. pH 7.5, fructose 1,6-diphosphate cause large stimulations activity. Alanine inhibits reaction effect partially reversed fructose 1,6-diphosphate. absence compounds, 4.0-5.0 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) required generate maximal activity assay system used. Electrophoresis reveals isoenzyme pattern containing one form pyruvate kinase, isoenzyme, fundic antral mucosa. pyruvate kinase gastric mucosa thus resembles M-type enzymes leucocytes liver. Measurements activity 1.0 mM PEP 4.0--5.0 mM PEP, without additions fructose 1,6-diphosphate, recommended reliable estimation pyruvate kinase activity tissue.
