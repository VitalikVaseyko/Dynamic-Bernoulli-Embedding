 SCOPE: Diet-induced obesity associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease increased become major health problem worldwide. study conducted investigate chemopreventive effects dietary Calebin-A, curcuminoid, differentiation 3T3-L1 adipocytes high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity hepatic steatosis. Potential mechanisms contributing effects also elucidated. METHODS RESULTS: Calebin-A effectively dose dependently suppressed accumulation lipid droplets adipocytes suppression adipogenic specific factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma fatty acid synthase activated acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Dietary Calebin-A effectively decreased weight gain relative perigonadal, retroperitoneal, mesenteric fat weight HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, Calebin-A markedly reduced hepatic steatosis serum levels glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, total cholesterol, triacylglycerol. effects associated downregulation PPARgamma, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, particularly activation AMP-activated protein kinase alpha signaling found adipocytes liver tissues. CONCLUSION: Taken together, results demonstrated first time Calebin-A suppressed adipocyte differentiation, prevented HFD-induced obesity, improved hepatic steatosis, suggesting novel application prevention treatment obesity associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
