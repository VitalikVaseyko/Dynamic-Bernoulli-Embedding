 cot-1 mutants belong class Neurospora crassa colonial temperature-sensitive (cot) mutants exhibit abnormal polar extension branching patterns grown restrictive temperatures. cot-1 encodes Ser/Thr protein kinase structurally related human myotonic dystrophy kinase which, impaired, confers disease involves changes cytoarchitecture ion homeostasis. grown restrictive conditions, cot-1 cultures exhibited enhanced medium acidification rates, increased relative abundance sodium, increased intracellular glycerol content, indicating ion homeostasis defect hyperbranching mutant. application ion transport blockers led mild suppression cot-1 phenotype. presence increased medium NaCl sorbitol, H(2)O(2), ethanol levels significantly suppressed cot-1 phenotype, restored ion homeostasis, accompanied reduced levels cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. cot-1 phenotype could also partially suppressed direct inhibition PKA KT-5720. reduced availability fermentable carbon sources also suppressive effect cot-1 phenotype. contrast effect extragenic ropy suppressors cot-1, environmental stress-related suppression cot-1 change COT1 polypeptide expression patterns mutant. suggest COT1 function linked environmental stress response signaling altering PKA activity bypasses requirement fully functional COT1.
