 Modulation glucose metabolic capacity human preantral follicles vitro gonadotropins intraovarian growth factors evaluated monitoring activities phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK), two regulatory enzymes glycolytic pathway, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), key mitochondrial enzyme Krebs cycle. Preantral follicles classes 1 2 premenopausal women cultured separately vitro absence presence FSH, LH, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) 24 h. Mitochondrial fraction separated cytosolic fraction, fractions used enzyme assays. FSH LH significantly stimulated PFK PK activities class 1 2 follicles; however, 170-fold increase MDH activity noted class 2 follicles exposed FSH. Although EGF TGFbeta1 stimulated glycolytic Krebs cycle enzymes class 1 preantral follicles, TGFbeta1 consistently stimulated activities glycolytic enzymes EGF. IGF-I induced PK MDH activities class 1 follicles negatively influenced PFK activity class 1 follicles. general, gonadotropins consistently stimulated glycolytic Krebs cycle enzyme activities several-fold class 2 follicles. results suggest gonadotropins ovarian growth factors differentially influence follicular energy-producing capacity glucose. Moreover, gonadotropins may either directly influence glucose metabolism class 2 preantral follicles indirectly factors well-known intraovarian growth factors. growth factors modulate granulosa cell mitosis functionality, role energy production may related specific cellular activities.
