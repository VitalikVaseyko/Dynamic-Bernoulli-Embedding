 basis transfection experiments using dominant-negative approach, previous studies suggested PKB (protein kinase B) involved heart PFK-2 (6-phosphofructo2-kinase) activation insulin. Therefore first tested whether SGK3 (serum- glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 3) might involved effect. Treatment recombinant heart PFK-2 [gamma-32P]ATP SGK3 vitro led PFK-2 activation phosphorylation Ser466 Ser483. However, HEK-293T cells [HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells expressing large T-antigen SV40 (simian virus 40)] co-transfected SGK3 siRNA (small interfering RNA) heart PFK-2, insulin-induced heart PFK-2 activation unaffected. involvement PKB heart PFK-2 activation insulin re-evaluated using different models: (i) hearts transgenic mice muscle/heart-specific mutation PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1)-substrate-docking site injected insulin; (ii) hearts PKBbeta-deficient mice injected insulin; (iii) freshly isolated rat cardiomyocytes perfused hearts treated selective Akti-1/2 PKB inhibitor prior insulin treatment; (iv) HEK-293T cells co-transfected heart PFK-2, PKBalpha/beta siRNA PKBalpha siRNA, incubated insulin. Together, results indicated SGK3 required insulin-induced PFK-2 activation effect likely mediated PKBalpha.
