 Inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase studied using intact mitochondria purified green leaf tissue pea (Pisum sativum L.) dialyzed mitochondrial extracts. Thiamine pyrophosphate inhibitory dialyzed extracts intact mitochondria, except presence high concentrations Na(+). NH(4) (+), concentrations low 20 micromolar, markedly stimulated inactivation dialyzed extracts. K(+) range 1 10 millimolar also enhanced inactivation. contrast, Na(+) without affect lower concentrations inhibitory 10 100 millimolar levels. effect NH(4) (+) discussed relation possible regulatory interaction photorespiratory NH(4) (+) production entry carbon tricarboxylic acid cycle way pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
