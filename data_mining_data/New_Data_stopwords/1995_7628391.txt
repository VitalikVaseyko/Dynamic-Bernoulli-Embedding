 investigated role islet pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme activity fatty acid oxidation impaired insulin secretion spontaneously diabetic GK rats. Blood glucose levels elevated 2- 3-month-old GK rats (8.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.5 +/- 0.3 mM control Wistar rats; P < 0.01), whereas serum insulin levels comparable control rats. Insulin DNA contents similar freshly isolated islets GK control rats, whereas insulin responses 27 mM glucose GK islets reduced 52%. effect acetate pyruvate insulin responses evoked succinate monomethylester (SAM) compared indirectly assess deficient generation acetyl-coenzyme pyruvate. Acetate potentiated SAM-induced insulin secretion similarly GK control islets, whereas 10 mM pyruvate (which supplies acetyl-coenzyme PDH enzyme activity) failed normally potentiate insulin secretion GK islets (92% SAM-induced response GK vs. 154% control islets). PDH activity (active form) decreased GK islets 35% (P < 0.001). proportion active form PDH total PDH activity reduced GK islets (56% vs. 71% control islets; P < 0.01). activity PDH kinase (which inactivates PDH phosphorylation) increased GK islets, rate ATP-dependent inactivation PDH -0.29 +/- 0.02 vs. -0.19 +/- 0.02/min control islets (P < 0.05). Culturing GK islets 48 h 5.5 mM glucose failed correct impaired insulin response glucose decreased PDH activity. Serum FFA levels islet triglyceride contents differ GK control rats. Etomoxir (1.0 10 microM), carnitine palmitoyl transferase inhibitor, failed enhance glucose-induced insulin release GK islets. following conclusions reached: 1) kinase-mediated decrease PDH activity islets GK rats may part account decreased ratio oxidized utilized glucose impaired insulin release islets; 2) impaired insulin release GK rats linked inhibitory influence islet fatty acid oxidation.
