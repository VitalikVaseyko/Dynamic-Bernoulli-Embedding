 1. freshly isolated blowfly mitochondria 38% intramitochondrial adenine nucleotide present AMP. 2. incubation oxidizable substrates AMP ADP concentrations fell ATP rose; pyruvate together proline ATP concentration reached maximum value 6min; glycerol phosphate phosphorylation endogenous nucleotide rapid. 3. Addition uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone caused rapid fall ATP parallel rise ADP, ADP converted AMP. 4. contrast rat liver mitochondria endogenous AMP concentrations, always lower blowfly mitochondria changed little different metabolic conditions. 5. Evidence presented adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3) dual distribution blowfly mitochondria, part located matrix space part space outer inner mitochondrial membranes, liver mitochondria. 6. possible regulatory role changing AMP concentrations mitochondrial matrix investigated. Partially purified pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) inhibited 30% 2mm-AMP, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1) unaffected. 7. AMP activated NAD(+)-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.41) activity blowfly mitochondria absence ADP, presence ADP, AMP caused inhibition. 8. suggested AMP may exert controlling effect oxidative activity blowfly mitochondria.
