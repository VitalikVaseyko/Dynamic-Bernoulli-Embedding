 Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) novel gene activated early colorectal cancer whose regulation functions unknown. CRNDE transcripts recognized long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), potentially interact chromatin-modifying complexes regulate gene expression via epigenetic changes. Complex alternative splicing results numerous transcripts gene, identified novel transcripts containing highly-conserved sequence within intron 4 ("gVC-In4"). colorectal cancer cells, demonstrate treatment insulin insulin-like growth factors (IGF) repressed CRNDE nuclear transcripts, including encompassing gVC-In4. repressive effects negated use inhibitors either PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway Raf/MAPK pathway, suggesting CRNDE downstream target signaling cascades. Expression array analyses revealed siRNA-mediated knockdown gVC-In4 transcripts affected expression many genes, showed correlation insulin/IGF signaling pathway components responses, including glucose lipid metabolism. genes identical affected insulin treatment cell line. results suggest CRNDE expression promotes metabolic changes cancer cells switch aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). first report lncRNA regulated insulin/IGFs, findings indicate role CRNDE nuclear transcripts regulating cellular metabolism may correlate upregulation colorectal cancer.
