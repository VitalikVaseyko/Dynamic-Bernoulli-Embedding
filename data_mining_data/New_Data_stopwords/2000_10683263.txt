 C(4) plants maize, pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) catalyzes regeneration initial carboxylation substrate C(4) photosynthesis. primary catalytic residue, His-458 (maize C(4) PPDK), involved ultimate transfer beta-phosphate ATP pyruvate. C(4) PPDK activity undergoes light-dark regulation vivo reversible phosphorylation nearby active-site residue (Thr-456) single bifunctional regulatory protein (RP). Using site-directed mutagenesis maize recombinant C(4) dikinase, made substitutions catalytic residue (H458N) regulatory target Thr (T456E, T456Y, T456F). affinity-purified mutant enzymes assayed changes dikinase activity. expected, substituting His-458 Asn results catalytically incompetent enzyme. Substitutions Thr-456 residue Tyr Phe reduced activity 94 99%, respectively. Insertion Glu position completely abolished activity, presumably introduction negative charge proximal catalytic His. Furthermore, neither T456Y inactive H458N mutant enzyme phosphorylated vitro RP. inability former serve phosphorylation substrate indicates RP functionally member Ser/Thr family protein kinases rather "dual-specificity" Ser-Thr/Tyr kinase, since previous work showed RP effectively phosphorylated Ser inserted position 456. inability RP phosphorylate native target Thr residue Asn substituted His-458 documents RP requires His-P catalytic intermediate form PPDK protein substrate. latter studies, synthetic phosphopeptide-directed antibodies specific Thr(456)-P form maize C(4) PPDK developed characterized.
