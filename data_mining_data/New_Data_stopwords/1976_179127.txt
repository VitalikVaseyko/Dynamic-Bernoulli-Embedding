 modification Aurbach & Houston's enzymic method measuring cAMP presented. procedure relatively simple several respects new. Urinary cAMP separated nucleotides phosphate ZnSO4-Ba(OH)2 precipitation column chromatography. eluate concentrated evaporation. Recovery stage 60-82%. cAMP urine standards dissolved reaction mixture converted 5-AMP cyclic 3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) ATP adenylate kinase pyruvate kinase. ATP formed labelled 32P exchange reaction catalysed glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase phosphoglycerate kinase. remaining 32P used count [32P]ATP aqueous phase. Daily human urinary cAMP excretion 3380 +/- 836 nmol (S.D.). injection 100 USP units parathormone intravenously patient idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, urinary cAMP excretion increased 40-fold basal concentration within 30 min. Drinking coffee water affect cAMP excretion. limit detection method 170 pmol cAMP, variation coefficient urine ranges 7 10%. enzymic cAMP method compared radioimmunological procedure, correlation coefficient found 0.98.
