 Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) dual role cancer; activation trigger apoptosis well stimulate cancer cell survival, proliferation, progression. shown TLR3 activation induce metabolic reprogramming pharyngeal cancer cell line, leading increased aerobic glycolysis, cell migration, elevated levels reactive oxidative species (ROS), decreased anti-oxidative response. Key proteins signaling pathways heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), CD44 variants, over-expressed TLR3 stimulation. TLR3 activation also induced upregulation different genes involved cancer progression (VEGF, MMP9, uPAR) enzymes involved glycolytic pathway. observed effects Myc-dependent; however, also connected MAPK HIF signaling pathways. Since TLR3 agonists investigated potential novel cancer therapy adjuvants apoptosis inducers, alone combination therapeutic options, data presented suggest extreme caution introduction clinical practice. fact TLR3 ligands [poly(I:C) poly(A:U)] also aid cancer survival progression, induction metabolic reprogramming, emphasizes need investigate particular topic. data suggest combination TLR3 ligands Myc MAPK inhibitors may way neutralize undesirable effects enhancing anti-tumor effect.
