 compared kinetic, immunological, electrophoretic properties human canine erythrocyte pyruvate kinase. enzymes allosteric subject positive negative regulation. allosteric properties canine enzyme pronounced human enzyme; however, properties enzymes consistent regulatory function glycolytic pathway respective erythrocytes. Antiserum human enzyme gives precipitin lines partial identity human canine enzymes immunodiffusion. anti-human serum inactivates enzymatic activity enzymes, although effective human enzyme canine. two enzymes slightly different mobilities starch gel electrophoresis. demonstrated differences erythrocyte pyruvate kinase dogs humans, conclude enzymes sufficiently similar properties function allow use dog model human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency.
