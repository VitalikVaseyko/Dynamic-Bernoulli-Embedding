 dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) consists 60 COOH-terminal domains inner assemblage sequentially via linker regions exterior pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) binding domain two lipoyl domains. Mature human E2, expressed protease-deficient Escherichia coli strain 27 degrees , prepared highly purified form. Purified E2 high acetyltransferase activity, well lipoylated based acetylation, bound large complement bovine E1. Electron micrographs demonstrated inner core assembled expected pentagonal dodecahedron shape E1 binding around inner core periphery. saturating E1 excess dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) E3-binding protein (E3BP), recombinant E2 supported overall PDC reaction 4% rate bovine E2.E3BP subcomplex. lipoates assembled human E2 free bilipoyl domain region reduced E3 rates proportional lipoyl domain concentration, E2.E3BP rapidly used concentration-independent manner consistent bound E3 rapidly using set lipoyl domains localized nearby. Given restriction need E3BP high PDC activity, directed channeling reducing equivalents bound E3 must efficient complex. recombinant E2 oligomer increased E1 kinase activity 4-fold and, Ca2+-dependent process, increased phospho-E1 phosphatase activity 15-fold. Thus E2 assemblage fully provides molecular intervention whereby single E2-bound kinase phosphatase molecule rapidly phosphorylate dephosphorylate, respectively, many E2-bound E1. Thus, prepared properly assembled, fully functional human E2 mediated enhanced regulatory enzyme activities but, lacking E3BP, supported low PDC activity.
