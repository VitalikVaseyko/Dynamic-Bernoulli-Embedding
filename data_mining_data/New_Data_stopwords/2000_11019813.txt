 Covalent modification pyruvate dehydrogenase complex provides important regulatory mechanism controlling disposal glucose compounds metabolized pyruvate. Regulation complex mechanism achieved part tissue-specific expression genes encoding isoenzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Starvation known previous work increase PDK activity heart skeletal muscle increasing amount PDK isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) present tissues. study demonstrates increased expression PDK4 PDK2 occurs rat liver, kidney, lactating mammary gland response starvation. PDK4 PDK2 message levels also increased starvation two tissues examined (liver kidney), suggesting enhancement gene transcription. Changes PDK2 message protein similar magnitude, changes PDK4 message greater PDK4 protein, suggesting regulation level translation. contrast tissues, starvation little effect PDK2 PDK4 protein brain, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue. Nevertheless, PDK4 message levels significantly increased brain white adipose tissue starvation. findings study indicate increased expression PDK isoenzymes important mechanism bringing inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex starvation many tissues body. absence mechanism preserves capacity neuronal tissue utilize glucose energy starvation.
