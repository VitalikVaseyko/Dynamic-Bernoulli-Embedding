 Four intragenic PKLR polymorphisms [1705A/C, 1738C/T. T10/19, (ATT)n microsatellite] studied normal population samples Central Portugal Sao Tome e Principe, small archipelago located Gulf Guinea, West Africa. loci, observed genotype distributions deviate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. allele frequencies found Portuguese population similar previously described Caucasian populations. Mother-child pair analysis (ATT)n microsatellite show deviations Mendelian rules. Sao Tome e Principe biallelic polymorphisms 1705A/C, 1738C/T, T10/19 presented inverse allelic frequencies compared Portuguese population. Two new alleles found (ATT)n microsatellite. Significant statistical differences found populations. results showed Sao Tomeans higher haplotype diversity lower linkage disequilibrium among polymorphic sites. PKLR intragenic polymorphisms, commonly used haplotype analysis gene mutations PK-deficient patients, thus successfully employed anthropological genetics.
