 method purification pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) light-grown Euglena gracilis var. bacillaris developed yielded enzyme preparation purified 115-fold crude extracts. organelle formation, levels pyruvate kinase extracts prepared cells engaged light-induced chloroplast development change significantly. enzyme molecular weight approximately 240,000 requirement K(+) Mg(2+). Fructose 1,6-diphosphate activates enzyme concentration phosphoenol-pyruvate limiting; activate concentration ADP limiting. ATP, citrate, Ca(2+) inhibitors enzyme inhibit fructose 1,6-diphosphate stimulation enzyme activity. ATP inhibition partially reversed high concentrations fructose 1,6-diphosphate. reversal inhibition achieved dialysis. Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition reversed chelating agent increased concentrations Mg(2+).The significance properties pyruvate kinase regulation photosynthetic carbohydrate metabolism, especially connection inability fructose 1,6-diphosphate reverse Ca(2+) ATP inhibitions, emphasized.
