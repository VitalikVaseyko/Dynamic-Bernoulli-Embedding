 Hyperthermia (HT) strong adjuvant treatment radiotherapy chemotherapy causes tumor reoxygenation. However, detailed molecular mechanisms HT enhances tumor oxygenation elucidated. report 1 h HT activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) tumors downstream targets, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). Consistent HIF-1 activation up-regulation downstream genes, HT also enhances tumor perfusion/vascularization decreases oxygen consumption. result, tumor hypoxia reduced HT, suggesting physiological changes contribute HT-induced tumor reoxygenation. HIF-1 potent regulator tumor vascularization metabolism, findings suggest HIF-1 plays role HT-induced tumor reoxygenation transactivating downstream targets. demonstrate NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species production, mechanism, up-regulates HIF-1 HT. Furthermore, determine pathway initiated increased transcription NADPH oxidase-1 ERK pathway. conclusion, study determines that, although HIF-1 good therapeutic target, timing inhibition needs optimized achieve beneficial outcome combined treatments HT, radiation, chemotherapy.
