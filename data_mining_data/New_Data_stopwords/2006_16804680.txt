 Rhizopus oryzae long used enzyme production (e.g., glucoamylase lipase), organic acid synthesis, various fermented food applications. work, describe set plasmid-based expression vectors used production heterologous proteins R. oryzae. Three plasmid vectors created using either glucoamylase (amyA), pyruvate decarboxylase (pdcA), phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk1) promoters drive expression heterologous proteins. three plasmids use pdcA terminator transcription termination, pyrG gene restoration uracil prototrophy, ampicillin resistance gene origin replication maintenance Escherichia coli. expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) compared transcription protein accumulation expression vectors. Accumulation GFP transcript protein directly correlated choice promoter pdcA > amyA > pgk1. Transcript level appears parallel GFP protein accumulation. Plasmid copy number little impact transcription protein accumulation. vectors useful overexpression heterologous proteins potentially, metabolic engineering Rhizopus strains.
