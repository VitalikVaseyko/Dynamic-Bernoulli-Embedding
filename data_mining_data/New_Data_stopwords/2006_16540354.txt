 report case man severe X-linked sideroblastic anemia, severe iron overload, hepatic cirrhosis died hepatocellular carcinoma. Evaluation family members using DNA sequencing revealed hemizygous novel ALAS2 mutation R452H (exon 9; nt 1407 G --> A). proband's brother, ALAS2 R452H hemizygote, mild anemia mild iron overload. Four female relatives ALAS2 R452H heterozygotes, mild anemia iron overload. Sequencing TFR2, HFE, FPN1 (SLC40A1), HAMP, HJV, erythrocyte pyruvate kinase genes family members also performed. thus detected novel TFR2 missense mutation I449V (exon 10; nt 1345 --> G) proband's wife daughter, neither anemia iron overload. Possible explanations disparate red blood cell iron phenotypes proband family members discussed.
