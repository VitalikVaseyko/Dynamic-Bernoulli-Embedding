 Corticosteroids frequently used livestock production, use permitted European Union therapeutic purposes only. However, small doses corticosteroids often administered meat-producing animals improve zootechnical performance. Prednisolone one commonly used corticosteroids growth-promoting purpose animal husbandry. study proposes identify gene whose expression significantly regulated prednisolone visceral subcutaneous adipose tissues. analysis conducted Friesian cattle treated prednisolone (30 mg day(-1)). reference gene expression stability optimal number gene expression normalization calculated. Family sequence similarity 107 member (FAM107A) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 prednisolone target genes identified adipose tissue. FAM107A downregulated approximately 2.9-fold prednisolone subcutaneous adipose tissue. result suggests FAM107A could possible indirect biomarker prednisolone treatment cattle encourages deeper investigation direction.
