 metabolism developing plant seeds directed toward transforming primary assimilatory products (sugars amino acids) seed storage compounds. understand role mitochondria metabolism, metabolic fluxes determined developing embryos Brassica napus. labeling [1,2-(13)C2]glucose + [U-(13)C6]glucose, [U-(13)C3]alanine, [U-(13)C5]glutamine, [(15)N]alanine, (amino)-[(15)N]glutamine, (amide)-[(15)N]glutamine, resulting labeling patterns protein amino acids fatty acids analyzed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fluxes mitochondrial metabolism quantified using steady state flux model. Labeling information experiments using different labeled substrates essential model validation reliable flux estimation. resulting flux map shows mitochondrial metabolism developing seeds different either heterotrophic autotrophic plant tissues organisms: (i) flux around tricarboxylic acid cycle absent small fluxes oxidative reactions mitochondrion generate (via oxidative phosphorylation) 22% ATP needed biosynthesis; (ii) isocitrate dehydrogenase reversible vivo; (iii) 40% mitochondrial pyruvate produced malic enzyme rather imported cytosol; (iv) mitochondrial flux largely devoted providing precursors cytosolic fatty acid elongation; (v) uptake amino acids rather anaplerosis via PEP carboxylase determines carbon flow storage proteins.
