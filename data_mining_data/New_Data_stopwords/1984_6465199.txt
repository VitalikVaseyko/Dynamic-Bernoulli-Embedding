 specific spectrophotometric assay muscle-pyruvate kinase (M-PK) used measure activity isozyme fetal muscle, fetal plasma amniotic fluid 17-24 wk gestational age assess predictive value prenatal diagnosis Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Fetal muscle obtained termination found contain high M-PK specific activity. significant activity detected amniotic fluid normal at-risk fetuses. Pure fetal blood obtained utero fetoscopy; significant plasma levels M-PK activity measured series control samples, at-risk fetal plasma contained higher levels. conclude M-PK use prenatal diagnosis DMD.
