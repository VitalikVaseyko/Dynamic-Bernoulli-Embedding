 highly purified glycolytic enzymes subjected isoelectric focusing found contain number enzymatically active species. Crystalline aldolase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase rabbit muscle resolved five components, crystalline aldolase yeast resolved three components, pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle yielded four components, yeast enolase resolved two components. Rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase (M(4)) gave one major peak protein enzymatic activity. profiles aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, yeast aldolases suggest random combinations two closely related subunits tetramers dimers, respectively. molecular heterogeneity enzymes easily related subunit structure.
