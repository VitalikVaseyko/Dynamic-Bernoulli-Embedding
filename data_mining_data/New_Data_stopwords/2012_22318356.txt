 Oxidative stress-energy depletion therapy using oxidative stress induced D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) energy depletion induced 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) reported recently (El Sayed et al., Cancer Gene Ther., 19, 1-18, 2012). Even presence oxygen, cancer cells oxidize glucose preferentially produce lactate (Warburg effect) seems vital cancer microenvironment progression. 3BP closely related structure lactate pyruvate may antagonize effects novel mechanism action. Pyruvate exerted potent H(2)O(2) scavenging effect exogenous H(2)O(2), lactate scavenging effect. 3BP induced H(2)O(2) production. Pyruvate protected H(2)O(2)-induced C6 glioma cell death, 3BP-induced C6 glioma cell death DAO/D-serine-induced cell death, lactate protecting effect. Lactate pyruvate protected 3BP-induced C6 glioma cell death energy depletion overcome higher doses 3BP. Lactate pyruvate enhanced migratory power C6 glioma blocked 3BP. Pyruvate lactate protect C6 glioma cell death induced glycolytic inhibitors e.g. citrate (inhibitor phosphofructokinase) sodium fluoride (inhibitor enolase). Serial doses 3BP synergistic citrate decreasing viability C6 glioma cells spheroids. Glycolysis subjected double inhibition using 3BP citrate depleted ATP, clonogenic power migratory power C6 glioma cells. 3BP induced caspase-dependent cell death C6 glioma. 3BP powerful decreasing viability human glioblastoma multiforme cells (U373MG) C6 glioma dose- time-dependent manner.
