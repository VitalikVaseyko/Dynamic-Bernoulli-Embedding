 Deficiencies enzymes involved erythrocyte metabolism significant effects erythrocyte function survival. Animals pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiencies shortened erythrocyte life spans regenerative anemia. PK-deficient dogs (but PK-deficient cats) develop progressive myelofibrosis osteosclerosis bone marrow hemochromatosis cirrhosis liver. PFK-deficient dogs sporadic episodes hyperventilation-induced intravascular hemolysis hemoglobinuria. Cytochrome b5 reductase (Cb5R) deficiency dogs cats results persistent methemoglobinemia cyanotic mucous membranes. Severe deficiency glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, rate-controlling enzyme pentose phosphate pathway, resulted anemia eccentrocytosis American saddlebred colt. Horses erythrocyte flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) deficiency eccentrocytosis (attributable severe deficiency glutathione reductase activity) methemoglobinemia (attributable Cb5R deficiency); dual enzyme deficiency occurs FAD required cofactor enzymes. Erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies usually shorten life expectancy, except PK-deficient dogs potentially PFK-deficient dogs hemolytic crisis. Although enzyme deficiencies rare causes anemia methemoglobinemia, ability diagnose deficient animals allows possibility eliminating undesirable traits future breeding. DNA-based assays available PK PFK deficiencies; whereas, biochemical tests enzyme activity required deficiencies. Continued research needed document additional enzyme deficiencies likely occur develop additional DNA-based assays detect heterozygous animals.
