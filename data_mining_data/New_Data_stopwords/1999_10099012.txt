 paper follows development activity key enzymes glycolysis dehydrogenases pentose phosphate shunt throughout vitro growth metacyclogenesis two human strains Leishmania infantum - one visceral (VL) cutaneous (CL) - together changes glucose, ammonium, proton concentrations culture medium. first stage, ammonium generated glucose consumed. Later on, glucose consumed and, finally, ammonium generated again. ammonium concentration increased 16- 21-fold cultures VL CL strains, respectively. activities glycosomal enzymes hexokinase phosphofructokinase differed strain, always higher CL VL increasing throughout culture period CL decreasing VL. probably indicates different capability adapt culture medium conditions. activities pentose phosphate shunt enzymes examined indicate 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase possibly rate-limiting enzyme pathway. Pyruvate kinase cytosolic control enzyme glycolysis trypanosomatids, activity decreased throughout growth differentiation strains L. infantum, occurs trypanosomatids. also observed glucose catabolism active cutaneous strain visceral one.
