 anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix sp. L2 fermentation glucose proceeds via Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Enzyme activities leading formation succinate, lactate, ethanol, formate associated cytoplasmic fraction. enzymes 'malic enzyme,' NAD(P)H:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, hydrogenase, acetate:succinate CoA transferase succinate thiokinase leading formation H2,CO2, acetate, ATP localized microbodies. Thus, organelles identified hydrogenosomes. addition, microbodies contain O2-scavenging enzymes NADH- NADPH oxidase, NAD(P)H peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase could detected. cell-free extracts zoospores Neocallimastix sp. L2 specific activities hydrogenosomal enzymes well quantities proteins 2- 6-fold higher mycelium extracts. findings suggest hydrogenosomes perform important role--especially zoospores--as H2-evolving, ATP-generating O2-scavenging organelles.
