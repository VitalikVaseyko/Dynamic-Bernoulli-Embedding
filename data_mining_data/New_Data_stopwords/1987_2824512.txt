 Dietary carbohydrates known stimulate L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression transcriptional level liver. However, short-term effects, time course, mechanism gene activation elemental hexoses normal fasted rats remain unknown. present study, glucose fructose found stimulate gene expression transcriptional level liver. However, kinetics extent mRNA induction differed according carbohydrate given. Fructose stimulated early (2-4 h) transiently gene transcription, RNA precursor, mRNA accumulation 48-h-fasted rats maximum stimulation RNA synthesis glucose delayed 12th h refeeding, despite early rise plasma insulin. contrast, insulin release required fructose trigger gene transcription, high cyclic AMP levels fasted rat liver prevent RNA synthesis fructose. agent(s) operating early fructose-fed animals might powerful enough require insulin gene activation balance inhibitory action glucagon liver.
