 Anoikis programmed cell death induced upon cell detachment extracellular matrix, behaving critical mechanism preventing adherent-independent cell growth attachment inappropriate matrix, thus avoiding colonizing distant organs. anchorage-independent growth epithelial-mesenchymal transition, two features associated anoikis resistance, vital steps cancer progression metastatic colonization, ability cancer cells resist anoikis attracted main attention scientific community. Cancer cells develop anoikis resistance due several mechanisms, including change integrins' repertoire allowing grow different niches, activation plethora inside-out pro-survival signals over-activation receptors due sustained autocrine loops, oncogene activation, growth factor receptor overexpression, mutation/upregulation key enzymes involved integrin growth factor receptor signaling. addition, tumor microenvironment also acknowledged contribute anoikis resistance bystander cancer cells, modulating matrix stiffness, enhancing oxidative stress, producing pro-survival soluble factors, triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition self-renewal ability, well leading metabolic deregulations cancer cells. events help cancer cells inhibit apoptosis machinery sustain pro-survival signals detachment, counteracting anoikis constituting promising targets anti-metastatic pharmacological therapy. article part Special Section entitled: Cell Death Pathways.
