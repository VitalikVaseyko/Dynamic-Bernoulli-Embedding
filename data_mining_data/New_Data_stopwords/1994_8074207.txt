 Substrate cycling pyruvate oxaloacetate assessed awake 24-h fasted normal triiodothyronine (T3)-treated rats. 20- 60-min infusion [3-13C]alanine (99% enriched, 12 mg/min) 13C enrichments liver glucose alanine carbons analyzed 13C 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Substrate cycling phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate [via pyruvate kinase (PK)] oxaloacetate pyruvate [via malic enzyme (ME)] relative pyruvate carboxylase (PC) flux [i.e., (PK+ME)/PC] assessed ratio 13C enrichment C-2 alanine relative C-5 glucose. normal rats (PK+ME)/PC 0.26 +/- 0.07 (n = 7, = 20 min) 0.37 +/- 0.08 (n = 4, = 60 min). T3-treated rats (PK+ME)/PC increased four- fivefold 1.03 +/- 0.19 (n = 8, = 20 min) 1.83 +/- 0.19 (n = 3, = 60 min) (P < 0.05 vs. normal rats). liver enzyme activity PK change T3 treatment (normal 14.22 +/- 5.25 U/g liver vs. T3 treated 13.40 +/- 1.10 U/g liver), whereas enzyme activity ratio PK (normal 0.47 +/- 0.15 vs. T3 treated 0.77 +/- 0.03, P < 0.05) activity (normal 0.89 +/- 0.30 U/g liver vs. T3 treated 4.25 +/- 0.60 U/g liver, P < 0.05) increased T3 treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
