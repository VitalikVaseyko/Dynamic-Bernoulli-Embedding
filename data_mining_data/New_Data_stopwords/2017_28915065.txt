 Hypoxia long implicated pathogenesis fibrotic diseases. Aberrantly activated myofibroblasts primary pathological driver fibrotic progression, yet various microenvironmental influences, hypoxia, contribute sustained activation differentiation poorly understood. defining feature hypoxia impact cellular metabolism, sought investigate hypoxia-induced metabolic reprogramming affects myofibroblast differentiation fibrotic progression, test preclinical efficacy targeting glycolytic metabolism treatment pulmonary fibrosis. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrotic progression evaluated two independent, fibroblast-specific, promoter-driven, hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) 1A knockout mouse models glycolytic inhibitor, dichloroacetate-treated mice. Genetic pharmacological approaches used explicate role metabolic reprogramming myofibroblast differentiation. Hypoxia significantly enhanced transforming growth factor-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation HIF-1alpha, whereas overexpression critical HIF-1alpha-mediated glycolytic switch, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) sufficient activate glycolysis potentiate myofibroblast differentiation, even absence HIF-1alpha. Inhibition HIF-1alpha/PDK1 axis genomic deletion Hif1A pharmacological inhibition PDK1 significantly attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. findings suggest HIF-1alpha/PDK1-mediated glycolytic reprogramming critical metabolic alteration acts promote myofibroblast differentiation fibrotic progression, demonstrate targeting glycolytic metabolism may prove potential therapeutic strategy treatment pulmonary fibrosis.
