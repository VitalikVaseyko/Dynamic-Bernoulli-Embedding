 posit following hypothesis: Independently whether malignant tumors initiated fundamental reprogramming gene expression seeded stem cells, "waves" gene expression promote metabolic changes occur carcinogenesis, beginning oncogene-mediated changes, followed hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)-mediated gene expression, resulting highly glycolytic "Warburg" phenotype suppression mitochondrial biogenesis. high proliferation rates malignancies cause aglycemia nutrient shortage, third (second oncogene) "wave" adaptation stimulates glutaminolysis, certain cases partially re-establishes oxidative phosphorylation; involves LKB1-AMPK-p53, PI3K-Akt-mTOR axes MYC dysregulation. Oxidative glutaminolysis serves alternative pathway compensating cellular ATP. Together anoxic glutaminolysis provides pyruvate, lactate, NADPH pool (alternatively pentose phosphate pathway). Retrograde signaling revitalized mitochondria might constitute fourth "wave" gene reprogramming. turn, upon reversal two Krebs cycle enzymes, glutaminolysis may partially (transiently) function even anoxia, thereby promoting malignancy. history carcinogenic process within malignant tumor determines final metabolic phenotype selected surviving cells, resulting distinct cancer bioenergetic phenotypes ranging highly glycolytic "classic Warburg" partial enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. discuss bioenergetically relevant functions oncogenes, involvement mitochondrial biogenesis/degradation carcinogenesis, yet unexplained Crabtree effect instant glucose blockade respiration, metabolic signaling stemming accumulation succinate, fumarate, pyruvate, lactate, oxoglutarate interfering prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme-mediated hydroxylation HIFalpha prolines.
