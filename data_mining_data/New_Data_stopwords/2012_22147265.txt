 tumour suppressor PTEN central negative regulator phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway, mediates diverse processes various tissues. nervous system, PI3K pathway modulates proliferation, migration, cellular size, synaptic transmission plasticity. humans, neurological abnormalities autism, seizures ataxia associated inherited PTEN mutations. rodents, Pten loss early development associated extensive deficits neuronal migration substantial hypertrophy neurons synaptic densities; however, whether effect synaptic transmission plasticity direct mediated structural abnormalities remains unknown. analysed neuronal synaptic structures function Pten-conditional knockout mice gene deleted excitatory neurons postnatally. Using two-photon imaging, Golgi staining, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, electrophysiological tools, determined Pten loss affect hippocampus development, neuronal synaptic structures, basal excitatory synaptic transmission. However, cause deficits major forms synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation long-term depression, excitatory synaptic transmission. deficits coincided impaired spatial memory, measured water maze tasks. Deletion Pdk1, encodes positive downstream regulator PI3K pathway, rescued Pten-mediated deficits synaptic plasticity spatial memory. results suggest PTEN independently modulates functional structural properties hippocampal neurons directly involved mechanisms synaptic plasticity.
