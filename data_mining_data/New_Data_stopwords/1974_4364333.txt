 Three genes, thrA, thrB, thrC, previously defined localized threonine locus Escherichia coli K-12. thrA, thrB, thrC specify enzymes aspartokinase I-homoserine dehydrogenase I, homoserine kinase, threonine synthetase, respectively. complementation analysis threonine cluster using derivatives lambda phage carrying threonine genes (lambdadthr(c)) demonstrates that: (i) thrB thrC consist single cistron; (ii) thrA composed two cistrons, thrA(1) thrA(2), although specifies single polypeptide chain. thrA(1) thrA(2) correspond aspartokinase homoserine dehydrogenase I, respectively. relative order established. demonstration polar effects mutations (nonsense induced phage Mu) thrA thrB taken evidence existence thrA thrB thrC operon, transcribed order.
