 Hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) important contaminant released domestic industrial effluents, represents predominant chemical form metal aquatic ecosystems. marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis exposure non-toxic, environmentally relevant concentrations Cr(VI) shown modulate functional parameters gene expression digestive gland hemocytes. work, effects exposure Cr(VI) (0.1-1-10 mug L(-1) animal(-1) 96 h) mussel gills investigated. Gill morphology immunolocalization GSH-transferase (GST), components involved cholinergic (AChE ChAT), adrenergic (TH) serotoninergic (5-HT(3) receptor) systems, regulating gill motility, evaluated. Total glutathione content, activities GSH-related enzymes (glutathione reductase - GSR, GST), catalase, key glycolytic enzymes (phosphofructokinase - PFK pyruvate kinase - PK) determined. Moreover, mRNA expression selected Mytilus genes (GST-pi, metallothionein isoforms MT10 MT20, HSP70 5-HT receptor) assessed RT-q-PCR. Cr(VI) exposure induced progressive changes gill morphology immunoreactivity components involved neurotransmission particularly evident highest concentration tested, associated large metal accumulation. Cr(VI) increased activities GST GSR, total glutathione content different extent different metal concentrations, suggesting Cr(VI) detoxication/reduction site metal entry. Cr(VI) exposure also increased activity glycolytic enzymes, indicating modulation carbohydrate metabolism. Significant changes transcription different genes observed. particular, mRNA level 5-HTR increased, whereas decreases increases observed GST-pi, MT10, MT20 HSP70 mRNAs, showing sex- concentration-related differences. results demonstrate Cr(VI) significantly affected functional molecular parameters mussel gills, indicate tissue represents major target exposure environmentally relevant concentrations metal.
