 Adrenaline myocarditis rats accompanied decrease relative activity pyruvate kinase hyaloplasm heart muscle, especially pronounced within 6-13 hrs adrenaline administration. phenomenon probably due increase content protein hyaloplasm, alteration enzyme activity. conclusion confirmed studies properties pyruvate kinase. pathological conditions Km phosphoenol pyruvate order magnitude normal state; 1-phenylalanine characterized inhibitor non-competitive type tomards phosphoenol pyruvate, palmitate exhibit inhibitory effect pyruvate kinase found normal state. effectiveness enzyme inhibition L-phenylalanine, protection enzyme amino acid effect L-alpha-alanine, L-serine L-cysteine, also degree activation pyruvate kinase amino acids adrenaline myocarditis similar phenomena observed normal state.
