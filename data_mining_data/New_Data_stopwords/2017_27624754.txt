 significant correlation degree tumor differentiation survival patients gastric cancers. report, compared proteomic differences poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma tissues well-differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma tissues order identify differentiation-related proteins may closely correlated differentiation gastric cancer pathogenesis. identified 7 proteins, calreticulin precursor, tapasinERP57 heterodimer, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 isoform M2, class Pi glutathione S-transferase, chain crystal structure human enolase 1 upregulated poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma compared well-differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, myosin-11 isoform SM2A actin alpha cardiac downregulated. Two them, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 isoform M2 enolase 1 enzymes involved glycolytic pathway. upregulation pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 isoform M2 enolase 1 poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma confirmed Western blotting immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, observed 107 cases gastric adenocarcinoma found high expression pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 isoform M2 enolase 1 correlates tumor size (P = .0001 P = .0017, respectively), depth invasion (P = .0024 P = .0261, respectively), poor prognosis patients. conclusion, proteomic analysis, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 isoform M2 enolase 1 identified upregulated poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma comparing well-differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. expression level pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 isoform M2 enolase 1 significantly correlated overall survival. would differentiation-related cancer biomarkers associated tumor metastasis, invasion, prognosis.
