 basis equilibrium adenylate kinase (AK; EC 2.7.4.3), interconverts MgATP free AMP MgADP free ADP, approach worked calculate concentrations free magnesium (Mg(2+)), based concentrations total ATP, ADP AMP plant tissues individual subcellular compartments. Based reported total adenylate contents, [Mg(2+)] plant tissues organelles varies significantly depending light dark regimes, plant age developmental stage. steady-state conditions, [Mg(2+)] chloroplasts similar light darkness (in millimolar range), whereas cytosol low light increases 0.4 mM darkness. dark-to-light transition (photosynthetic induction), [Mg(2+)] chloroplasts falls low values (0.2 mM less), corresponding delay photosynthetic oxygen evolution. delay considered result lower activities Mg-dependent enzymes Calvin cycle. mitochondria, changes [Mg(2+)] similar smoother. hand, transition light darkness considered, initial increase [Mg(2+)] occurs chloroplasts mitochondria, may importance control key regulatory enzymes (e.g. mitochondrial malic enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) processes connected light-enhanced dark respiration. rationale presented possible role [MgATP]/[MgADP] ratio (rather [ATP(total)]/[ADP(total)]) important component metabolic cellular control. postulated assays total adenylates may provide accurate measure [Mg(2+)] plant tissues/cells subcellular compartments, given adenylates equilibrated AK.
