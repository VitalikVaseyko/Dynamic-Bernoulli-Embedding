 Abnormal glucose metabolism enhanced oxidative stress accelerate cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammatory condition causing high morbidity mortality. Here, report monocytes macrophages patients atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD), overutilization glucose promotes excessive prolonged production cytokines IL-6 IL-1beta, driving systemic tissue inflammation. patient-derived monocytes macrophages, increased glucose uptake glycolytic flux fuel generation mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, turn promote dimerization glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) enable nuclear translocation. Nuclear PKM2 functions protein kinase phosphorylates transcription factor STAT3, thus boosting IL-6 IL-1beta production. Reducing glycolysis, scavenging superoxide enforcing PKM2 tetramerization correct proinflammatory phenotype CAD macrophages. essence, PKM2 serves previously unidentified role molecular integrator metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress tissue inflammation represents novel therapeutic target cardiovascular disease.
