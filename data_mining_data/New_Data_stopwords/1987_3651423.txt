 study enzymes sequestered artificial biological systems generally conducted indirect methodology macroscopic measurements reactants bulk medium. paper describes new approach firefly luciferase monitor ATP concentration directly microenvironment enzymes producing consuming ATP. Upon addition ATP immobilized firefly luciferase, onset light production slower observed soluble enzyme, due slower diffusion ATP immobilized enzyme. immobilized pyruvate kinase, relative accumulation ATP inside beads demonstrated, measured coimmobilized firefly luciferase. accumulation product (ATP) enhanced bead suspension stirred. ATP beads relatively inaccessible soluble hexokinase added bulk medium. Similarly, rapid ATP depletion microenvironment immobilized hexokinase demonstrated. microscopic event kinetically distinguishable slower macroscopic depletion substrate bulk medium. rate depletion microenvironment depends local activity immobilized enzyme total amount enzyme suspension, macroscopic phenomenon. theoretical principles interaction diffusion catalysis systems briefly summarized discussed. results relevant various molecular mechanisms proposed membrane-bound enzyme action regulation, derived macroscopic kinetic measurements assuming negligible diffusion control.
