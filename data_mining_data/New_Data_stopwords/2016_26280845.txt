 Despite numerous applications, lack fundamental understanding variables nanoparticle (NP) size influence activity tethered enzymes. Previously, showed biomimetic oriented immobilization yielded higher specific activities versus nonoriented adsorption carboxyl-amine binding. Here, standardize NP attachment strategy (oriented immobilization via hexahistidine tags) composition (Ni-NTA coated gold NPs), test impact NP size (5, 10, 20, 50 nm) multilayer formation, activity, kinetic parameters (kcat, KM, kcat/KM) enzymes representing three different classes: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), isomerase; Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDHS), oxidoreductase; pyruvate kinase (PK), transferase. Contrary reports, observed trend kinetic parameters individual enzymes found monolayers (<100% enzyme coverage), suggesting advantage oriented immobilization versus attachment strategies. Saturating NPs maximize activity per NP resulted enzyme multilayer formation. conditions, total activity per NP increased increasing NP size. Conversely, specific activity three enzymes highest tethered smallest NPs, retaining remarkable 73-94% activity free/untethered enzymes. Multilayer formations caused clear trend kcat decreasing increasing NP size, yet negligible change KM. Understanding fundamental relationships NP size tethered enzyme activity enables optimized design various applications, maximizing activity per NP activity per enzyme molecule.
