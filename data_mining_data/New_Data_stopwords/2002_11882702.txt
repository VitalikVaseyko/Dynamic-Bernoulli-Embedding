 Campylobacter jejuni unable utilize glucose carbon source due absence key glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase. genome sequence C. jejuni NCTC 11168 indicates homologues appropriate enzymes gluconeogenesis phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) present, addition anaplerotic enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (PYC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) malic enzyme (MEZ). Surprisingly, pyruvate kinase (PYK) homologue also present. ascertain role enzymes, insertion mutants pycA, pycB, pyk mez generated. However, could achieved pckA, indicating PCK essential enzyme C. jejuni. lack PEP synthase pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase activities confirmed unique role PCK PEP synthesis. pycA mutant unable grow defined medium pyruvate lactate major carbon source, thus indicating important role PYC anaplerosis. Sequence biochemical data indicate PYC C. jejuni member alpha4beta4, acetyl-CoA-independent class PYCs, 65.8 kDa subunit containing biotin moiety. Whereas growth mez mutant comparable wild-type, pyk mutant displayed decreased growth rate complex medium. Nevertheless, mez pyk mutants able grow pyruvate, lactate malate carbon sources defined medium. PYK present cell extracts much higher specific activity [>800 nmol x min(-1) x (mg protein)(-1)] PYC PCK [<65 nmol x min(-1) x (mg protein)(-1)], activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate displayed regulatory properties strongly indicative catabolic role. concluded PYK may function catabolism unidentified substrates metabolized PEP. view high K(m) MEZ malate (approximately 9 mM) lack growth phenotype mez mutant, MEZ seems minor anaplerotic role C. jejuni.
