 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) occupies strategic role renal intermediary metabolism, via partitioning pyruvate flux oxidation entry gluconeogenic pathway. Inactivation PDC via activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), catalyze PDC phosphorylation, occurs secondary increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO). kidney, inactivation PDC prolonged starvation mediated up-regulation protein expression two PDK isoforms, PDK2 PDK4. lipid-activated transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha), plays pivotal role cellular metabolic response fatty acids abundant kidney. present study used PPAR alpha null mice examine potential role PPAR alpha regulating renal PDK protein expression. wild-type mice, fasting (24 h) induced marked up-regulation protein expression PDK4, together modest up-regulation PDK2 protein expression. striking contrast, renal protein expression PDK4 marginally induced fasting PPAR alpha null mice. present results define critical role PPAR alpha renal adaptation fasting, identify PDK4 downstream target PPAR alpha activation kidney. propose specific up-regulation renal PDK4 protein expression starvation, maintaining PDC activity relatively low, facilitates pyruvate carboxylation oxaloacetate therefore entry acetyl-CoA derived FA beta-oxidation TCA cycle, allowing adequate ATP production brisk rates gluconeogenesis.
