 Strong experimental evidence animal cellular models supports pivotal role sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) oncogenesis. many human cancers, SK1 levels upregulated increases linked poor prognosis patients. Here, employing untargeted NMR-based metabolomic profiling combined functional validations, report crucial role SK1 metabolic shift known Warburg effect A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Indeed, expression SK1 induced high glycolytic rate, characterized increased levels lactate along increased expression proton/monocarboxylate symporter MCT1, decreased oxidative metabolism, associated accumulation intermediates tricarboxylic acid cycle reduction CO2 production. Additionally, SK1-expressing cells displayed significant increase glucose uptake paralleled GLUT3 transporter upregulation. role SK1 limited induction aerobic glycolysis, affecting metabolic pathways appear support biosynthesis macromolecules. findings highlight role SK1 signaling axis cancer metabolic reprogramming, pointing innovative strategies cancer therapies.
