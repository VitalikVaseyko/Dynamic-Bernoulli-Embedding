 Mutations gene encoding hepatic nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1-alpha) cause subtype human diabetes resulting selective pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. analyzed mice lacking HNF1-alpha study protein controls beta-cell-specific transcription vivo. show HNF1-alpha essential expression glut2 glucose transporter L-type pyruvate kinase (pklr) genes pancreatic insulin-producing cells, whereas liver, kidney, duodenum tissue, glut2 pklr expression maintained absence HNF1-alpha. HNF1-alpha nevertheless occupies endogenous glut2 pklr promoters pancreatic islet liver cells. However, indispensable hyperacetylation histones glut2 pklr promoter nucleosomes pancreatic islets liver cells, glut2 pklr chromatin remains hyperacetylated absence HNF1-alpha. contrast, phenylalanine hydroxylase promoter requires HNF1-alpha transcriptional activity localized histone hyperacetylation liver tissue. Thus, different HNF1-alpha target genes distinct requirements HNF1-alpha either pancreatic beta-cells liver cells. results indicate HNF1-alpha occupies target gene promoters diverse tissues plays obligate role transcriptional activation cellular- promoter-specific contexts required recruit histone acetylase activity. findings provide genetic evidence based live mammalian system establish single activator essential direct nucleosomal hyperacetylation transcriptional targets.
