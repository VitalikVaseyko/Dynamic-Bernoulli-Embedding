 Fractions (salted ammonium sulphate 21-30% saturation), fractions B (salted 51-70% saturation) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40.) corresponding respectively pyruvate kinase types L M2 rat liver Morris hepatoma 7777 purified affinity chromatography Blue Sepharose CL-6B. Peaks inactive proteins eliminated enzyme fractions bound biospecifically gels eluted free ADP. molecular mass purified hepatoma pyruvate kinase fraction B smaller liver pyruvate kinase fraction B. Morris hepatoma pyruvate kinase fraction B represented variant type M2, characterised greatest affinity 2-phosphoenolpyruvate main substrate different sensitivity low-molecular effectors comparison types L liver hepatoma comparison type M2 normal rat liver. hepatoma fraction B showed tumour specific sensitivity L-cysteine insensitive normal signal molecules i.e. ATP fructose-1,6-diphosphate influence liver pyruvate kinase activity. L-Cysteine inhibited tumour fraction B pyruvate kinase decreasing Vmax increasing Km values relation 2-phosphoenolpyruvate.
