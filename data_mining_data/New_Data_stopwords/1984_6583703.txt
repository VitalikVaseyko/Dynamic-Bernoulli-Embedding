 X chromosome-linked mouse mutant (gene symbol, mdx) found elevated plasma levels muscle creatine kinase pyruvate kinase exhibits histological lesions characteristic muscular dystrophy. mutants show mild clinical symptoms viable fertile. Linkage analysis four X chromosome loci indicates mdx maps Hq Bpa region mouse X chromosome. gives gene order mdx-Tfm-Pgk-1-Ags, equivalent genes human X chromosome.
