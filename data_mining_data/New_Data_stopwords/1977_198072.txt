 Hormone-stimulated lipolysis adipose tissue inhibited fluoroacetate concomitant decrease basal hormone-stimulated cyclic AMP levels. Adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity membrane preparations inhibited fluoroacetate. influence fluoroacetate low Km cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) activity. rate glucose conversion fatty acids increased adipose tissue incubated presence fluoroacetate. outputs pyruvate lactate incubation medium decreased time, suggesting decreased tissue pyruvate levels site activation lipogenesis distal pyruvate formation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1) activity increased twofold adipose tissue incubated presence fluoroacetate. attributed fluoroacetate-induced inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, enzyme responsible inactivating pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Glucose transport increased small significant degree fluoroacetate. addition, tissue content citrate release incubation medium increased, suggesting fluoroacetate resulted inhibition aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3). tissue ATP content unchanged. antilipolytic lipogenic effects fluoroacetate parallel insulin, may share common mechanism.
