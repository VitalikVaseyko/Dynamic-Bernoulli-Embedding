 Gliomas common type primary malignancy central nervous system. identification mutations gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase1 (IDH1) represents key area investigation studies glioma. IDH1R132H mutation heterozygous point mutation, affects amino acid arginine position 132, however, metabolic importance mutation tumor cell growth remains elucidated. present study, A172 glioma cell lines stably overexpressing either wildtype IDH1 IDH1R132H produced. results demonstrated IDH1R132H mutation enhanced proliferation A172 glioma cells vitro. Furthermore, IDH1R132H performed function elevating expression levels hypoxia inducible factor1alpha, leading increase expression levels key glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporter 1 hexokinase 2. Therefore, metabolism shifted towards aerobic glycolysis, leading increase glucose uptake lactate production. findings demonstrated IDH1R132H molecular target involved orchestrating Warburg effect mutant IDH1R132H glioma cells.
