 G6PC3 widely expressed isoform glucose-6-phosphatase, found many foetal adult tissues. Mutations gene cause developmental abnormalities severe neutropenia due abolition glucose recycling cytoplasm endoplasmic reticulum. Low G6PC3 expression result promoter polymorphisms dysregulation could produce similar outcomes. investigated regulation human G6PC3 promoter activity. HeLa H4IIE cells transiently transfected G6PC3 promoter coupled firefly luciferase gene, promoter activity measured dual luciferase assay. Activity highest 453 bp segment G6PC3 promoter, -455 -3 relative transcriptional start site. promoter unresponsive glucostatic hormones. activity increased significantly 1 5.5 mM glucose, elevated glucose concentrations 25 mM. Pyruvate increased activity, beta-hydroxybutyrate sodium acetate not. Promoter activity reduced inhibitors hexokinase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase oxidative branch pentose phosphate pathway, transketolase inhibitor. Deletion two adjacent Enhancer-boxes (-274 -279 -299 -304) reduced promoter activity abolished glucose effect, suggesting could function glucose response element. Deletion additional downstream 140 bp (-140 -306) restored activity, glucose response, suggesting presence repressor elements region. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) reduced promoter activity, showing dependence AMP-kinase. Regulation G6PC3 promoter thus radically different hepatic isoform, G6PC. sensitive carbohydrate, fatty acid metabolites, much lower physiological concentrations. Based findings, speculate reduced G6PC3 expression could occur hypoglycemic episodes vivo, common utero postnatal period. episodes lower G6PC3 expression could place foetus infant risk impaired immune function development, possibility requires examination vitro vivo.
