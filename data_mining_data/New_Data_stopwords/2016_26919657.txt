 Cancer cells characterized metabolic alterations, namely, depressed mitochondrial oxidation, enhanced glycolysis pentose phosphate shunt flux support rapid cell growth, called Warburg effect. study assessed metabolic consequences joint treatment MCF-7 breast cancer cells AICAR, inducer AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) jointly methotrexate (MTX), folate-analog antimetabolite blunts de novo nucleotide synthesis. MCF7 cells, model breast cancer cells, resistant individual application AICAR MTX, however combined treatment AICAR MTX reduced cell proliferation. Prolonged joint application AICAR MTX induced AMPK consequently enhanced mitochondrial oxidation reduced rate glycolysis. metabolic changes suggest anti-Warburg rearrangement metabolism led block G1/S G2/M transition slowing cell cycle. slowdown cell proliferation abolished mitotropic transcription factors, PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta FOXO1 silenced. human breast cancers higher expression AMPKalpha FOXO1 extended survival. AICAR MTX exerts similar additive antiproliferative effect breast cancer cell lines, SKBR 4T1 cells, too. data underline importance Warburg metabolism breast cancer cells nominate AICAR+MTX combination potential cytostatic regime blunting Warburg metabolism. Furthermore, suggest targeting AMPK FOXO1 combat breast cancer.
