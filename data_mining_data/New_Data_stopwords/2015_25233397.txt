 BACKGROUND: Tumour cells exclusively express embryonic M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2). PKM2 expression levels correlated effect platinum compounds cancer cell lines xenograft models. potential predictive role PKM2 patients metastatic/advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving platinum-based chemotherapy first-line investigated. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR used assess expression PKM2 tumour samples 148 157 NSCLC patients training validation set, respectively. patients received front-line platinum-based chemotherapy. PKM2 mRNA expression also analysed control group 85 NSCLC patients treated non-platinum containing regimens. RESULTS: training set, high PKM2 mRNA levels associated decreased progression-free survival (PFS; 4.9 months vs 6.4, P=0.006), overall survival (OS; 10.1 vs 17.0 months, P=0.01) disease control rate (DCR; 57.7% vs 74.3%; P=0.021) compared patients low PKM2 levels. validation set, high PKM2 mRNA levels also associated deceased PFS (3.7 vs 5.9 months, P=0.006), OS (8.3 vs 16.8 months, P=0.003) DCR (57.7% vs 70.9%; P=0.049) compared low PKM2 mRNA levels. correlation PKM2 mRNA levels PFS (5.6 vs 5.9, P=0.43) OS (9.8 vs 10.1, P=0.51) control group. Multivariate analysis revealed high PKM2 mRNA expression independent predictive factor poor patients' outcome. CONCLUSIONS: PKM2 expression may predictive biomarker platinum sensitivity advanced NSCLC patients treated platinum-based chemotherapy.
