 OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs caught attention role tumor progression. Retinoblastoma (RB) one ordinary malignant tumors. study aims identify whether mir-138-5p regulate development RB, find potential mechanism. MATERIALS METHODS: Mir-138-5p expression RB cells monitored RT-qPCR. Besides, role mir-138-5p RB development explored function experiments vitro. potential mechanism explored RT-qPCR, luciferase assay, Western blot assay. RESULTS: investigation, mir-138-5p lower-expressed RB cells retinal pigment epithelial cells. Moreover, overexpression mir-138-5p repressed cell viability, migration invasion, induced apoptosis RB cells, downregulated mir-138-5p increased cell viability, migration invasion, reduced apoptosis RB cells. Furthermore, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) could downregulated via overexpression mir-138-5p, PDK1 upregulated via knockdown mir-138-5p. CONCLUSIONS: results suggested mir-138-5p could repress development RB via suppressing PDK1, may offer new vision interpreting mechanism RB tumorigenesis.
