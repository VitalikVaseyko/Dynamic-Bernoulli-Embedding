 experimental arrangement described allows studies temporal performance enzyme reactions (also reactions complexes enzyme chains) conditions open systems. various steady-state properties open systems recognized measuring input output [1,2]. various levels flowing equilibria perturbed applying molecular modulators system, data obtained compared found closed systems. order prove accuracy experimental configuration, determination Km one-substrate reaction carried open system, using one concentration substrate various flow rates.
