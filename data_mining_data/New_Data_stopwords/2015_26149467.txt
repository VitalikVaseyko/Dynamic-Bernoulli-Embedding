 Cancer cells utilize large amounts ATP sustain growth, relying primarily non-oxidative, fermentative pathways production. many types cancers leads, even presence oxygen, secretion carbon equivalents (usually form lactate) cell's surroundings, feature known Warburg effect. molecular basis phenomenon still elucidated, clear spilling energy resources contributes creating peculiar microenvironment tumors, possibly characterized degree toxicity. suggests mechanisms recycling fermentation products (e.g. lactate shuttle) may active, effectively inducing mutually beneficial metabolic coupling aberrant non-aberrant cells. analyze scenario large-scale silico metabolic model interacting human cells. going beyond cell-autonomous description, show elementary physico-chemical constraints indeed favor establishment coupling broad conditions. characterization obtained tuning aberrant cell's demand ATP, amino-acids fatty acids and/or imbalance nutrient partitioning provides quantitative support idea synergistic multi-cell effects play central role cancer sustainment.
