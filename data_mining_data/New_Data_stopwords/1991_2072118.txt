 Serum creatine-kinase (CK) activities determined 536 patients affected X-linked muscular dystrophy (456 Duchenne DMD 80 Becker BMD) serum pyruvate-kinase (PK) 360 among (309 DMD 51 BMD). aim investigation assess variability rate decrease serum activity DMD compared BMD function age DMD function Vignos scale well. DMD, maximum CK PK activities found around 1-6 years old average rate decline according age estimated 0.18 per year 0.27-0.29 enzymes function Vignos scale (assessed 291 cases). BMD, maximum serum enzyme levels found around 10-15 years old rate decline serum activity per year 0.06 CK 0.07 PK. maximum levels serum enzyme reflect active muscle degeneration rate decline per year progressive loss muscle mass (responsible release muscle enzymes blood stream) observations suggest: (a) active muscle degeneration occurs, average, 5 years later group outliers 10 years later BMD compared severe DMD; (b) rate muscle mass lost significantly greater DMD BMD therefore serum enzyme determinations may represent important test evaluation therapeutic trials; (c) serum enzymes determination may represent important preliminary test discriminate proportion young patients develop severe milder phenotype.
