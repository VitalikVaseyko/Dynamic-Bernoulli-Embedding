 Cellular senescence, irreversible cell cycle arrest induced diversity stimuli, considered innate tumor suppressing mechanism implications applications cancer therapy. Using targeted proteomics approach, show fibroblasts induced senescence expression oncogenic Ras exhibit decrease global acetylation core histones, consistent formation senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. also detected clear increases repressive markers (e.g. >50% elevation H3K27me2/3) along decreases histone marks associated increased transcriptional expression/elongation (e.g. H3K36me2/3). Despite increases repressive marks chromatin, 179 loci (of 2206 total) found upregulated global quantitative proteomics. changes cytosolic proteome indicated upregulation mitochondrial proteins downregulation proteins involved glycolysis. alterations primary metabolism opposite well-known Warburg effect observed cancer cells. study significantly improves understanding stress-induced senescence provides potential application triggering antiproliferative strategies target primary metabolism cancer cells.
