 Erythrocytes adults newborn infants (at term premature) separated Percoll density gradient centrifugation four fractions increasing density. Glycolytic enzymes, especially age-dependent ones, hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1, HK), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40, PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49, G6PD) studied reticulocyte maturation red cell senescence. Analysis fraction lowest density showed almost linear steep decline HK, PK, G6PD activity decreasing number reticulocytes. next three fractions increasing density, activity decline far less. data therefore illustrative biphasic activity decay pattern HK, PK, G6PD adult neonatal red cell aging. strong decline HK activity could ascribed disappearance particulate (mitochondrial) bound fraction enzyme reticulocyte maturation. hexokinase activity human reticulocytes found cytosolic contrast rabbit reticulocytes 70% HK activity particulate.
