 Kinetic properties regulatory enzymes glycolysis liver mouse, Zapus hudsonius, modified hibernation, probable mechanism covalent modification. Liver glycogen phosphorylase activity strongly depressed short (less 24 h) long (5-8 days) term hibernation, mechanism involving decrease percentage enzyme active form total amount (a + b) enzyme expressed. Phosphofructokinase showed kinetic changes (a 2.5-fold increase Ka fructose-2,6-P2, 4- 3.7-fold decreases I50 values ATP citrate, compared euthermic controls) liver hibernators indicative phosphorylation inactivation enzyme. Measured levels fructose-2,6-P2 liver change hibernation. Changes pyruvate kinase kinetics liver long term hibernators similarly indicated enzyme phosphorylation depressed state (Ka fructose-1,6-P2 increased 4.4-fold, I50 L-alanine decreased 6.3-fold). Apparent covalent modification glycolytic enzymes hibernation may serve two functions: depression glycolytic activity part general metabolic rate depression hibernation, reorganization fuel use hibernating state limit carbohydrate catabolism promote gluconeogenesis.
