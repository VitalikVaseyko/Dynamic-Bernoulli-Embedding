 One key brain regions cognitive processing executive function prefrontal cortex (PFC), receives cholinergic input basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. evaluated contribution synaptically released acetylcholine (ACh) executive function genetically targeting vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) mouse forebrain. Executive function assessed using pairwise visual discrimination paradigm 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRT). pairwise test, VAChT-deficient mice able learn, impaired reversal learning, suggesting mice present cognitive inflexibility. Interestingly, VAChT-targeted mice took longer reach criteria 5-CSRT. Although performance indistinguishable control mice low attentional demand, increased attentional demand revealed striking deficits VAChT-deleted mice. Galantamine, cholinesterase inhibitor used Alzheimer's disease, significantly improved performance control mice, VAChT-deficient mice 5-CSRT. vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed altered levels two neurochemical markers neuronal function, taurine lactate, suggesting altered PFC metabolism VAChT-deficient mice. PFC mice displayed drastic reduction splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2/B1), whose cholinergic-mediated reduction previously demonstrated Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, several key hnRNPA2/B1 target transcripts involved neuronal function present changes alternative splicing VAChT-deficient mice, including pyruvate kinase M, key enzyme involved lactate metabolism. propose VAChT-targeted mice used model dissect neurochemical basis executive abnormalities.
