 Human placental mitochondria prepared new isolation procedure exhibit low well coupled rates state 3 respiration different substrates (succinate: 32.3 nmol O2/mg/min, RCI = 4.4; pyruvate: 12.6 nmol O2/mg/min, RCI R = 4.2; palmitoylcarnitine: 16.6 nmol O2/mg/min, RCI R = 4.9). addition uncoupler FCCP increased respiratory rates (succinate: 40.7 nmol O2/mg/min; pyruvate: 21.2 nmol O2/mg/min: palmitoylcarnitine: 25.4 nmol O2/mg/min). low respiratory rates correlate well low capacity respiratory chain shown specific contents cytochrome c (0.15 nmol/mg), cytochrome b (0.19 nmol/mg) cytochrome oxidase (0.14 nmol/mg) well low content adenine nucleotides (2.71 nmol/mg). data together finding high activities alkaline phosphatase (2.2 U/mg) support view human placental mitochondria contaminated nonmitochondrial membranes. Since possible obtain functionally intact mitochondria negligible activities alkaline phosphatase influence enzyme extramitochondrial adenine nucleotide turnover investigated. Alkaline phosphatase splits phosphate ATP, ADP AMP different rates resulting intermediate accumulation AMP. Mitochondrial adenylate kinase (0.16 U/mg) regenerated ADP AMP ATP resulting drastically decreased ADP/O ratios prolonged state 3 respirations. Inhibiting adenylate kinase diadenosine pentaphosphate ADP regeneration AMP ATP suppressed which, turn, enhanced ADP/O ratios. absence magnesium ions, alkaline phosphatase adenylate kinase inhibited normal ADP/O ratios state 3-state 4 transitions observed. conditions, human placental mitochondria showed normal properties comparable mitochondria tissues exception low specific activities.
