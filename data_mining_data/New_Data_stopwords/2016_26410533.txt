 Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) highly expressed many solid tumors associated metabolism reprogramming proliferation tumors. Here, report PKM2 bind DNA Damage-Binding Protein 2 (DDB2), necessary global nucleotide excision repair UV induced DNA damage. binding promoted UV irradiation K433 acetylation PKM2. expression PKM2 facilitates phosphorylation DDB2 impairs DDB2-DDB1 binding. Furthermore, knocking PKM2 increases cell survival upon UV irradiation, expression PKM2 reduces cell survival expression DDB2-DDB1 reverts effect. results reveal previously unknown regulation PKM2 DDB2 provide possible mechanism UV induced tumorigenesis.
