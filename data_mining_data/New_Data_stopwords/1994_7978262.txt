 paper describes continuous spectrophotometric assay glycosyltransferases. assay, nucleotide diphosphate coupled NADH oxidation via pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. nucleotide diphosphate produced either directly glycosyltransferase mediated reaction, indirectly production nucleotide monophosphate glycosyltransferase mediated reaction, subsequent conversion nucleotide monophosphate nucleotide diphosphate using nucleoside monophosphate kinase. Using assay, kinetic parameters fucosyl-, sialyl-, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases determined. assay allows continual monitoring enzymatic reaction, rapid allows processing 96 samples since performed 96-well microtiter plates. addition, procedure provides means monitoring activity enzymes using sugar-nucleotide donor analogs, radiochemical procedures cannot used.
