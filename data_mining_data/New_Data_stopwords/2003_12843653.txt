 M2-type pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) mRNA produced PKM gene alternative RNA splicing adipocytes. found insulin increased level M2-PK mRNA 3T3-L1 adipocytes time- dose-dependent manners. induction require presence glucose glucosamine medium. insulin effect blocked pharmacological inhibitors insulin signaling pathways wortmannin, inhibitor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), PD98059, inhibitor mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase. stable reporter expression assay showed promoter activity 2.2-kb 5'-flanking region rat PKM gene stimulated insulin, extents stimulations lower mRNA stimulation. Thus, suggest insulin increases level M2-PK mRNA adipocytes acting transcriptional post-transcriptional levels signaling pathways involving PI3K MAPK kinase.
