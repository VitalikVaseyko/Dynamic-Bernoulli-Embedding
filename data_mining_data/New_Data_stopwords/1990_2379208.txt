 CMP-sialic acids, cytidine 5'-(5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-beta-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosy lonic acid monophosphate) (1) cytidine 5'-(5-acetamido-9-O-acetyl-3,5-dideoxy-beta-D-glycero-D-galacto-2- nonulopyranosylonic acid monophosphate) (2) prepared CMP, phosphoenolpyruvate, N-acetylneuraminic acid 9-acetate, catalytic amount ATP presence immobilised pyruvate kinase, nucleoside monophosphate kinase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, CMP-sialic acid synthetase. CMP-NeuAc (1) used donor N-acetylneuraminic acid reaction catalysed immobilised porcine liver beta-D-Galp-(1----4)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(2----6)-sialyltransferase, alpha-D-Neup5Ac-(2----6)-beta-D-Galp-(1----4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1--- -2)-alpha-D- Man-OMe (5) obtained 0.1-mmol scale enzymic sialylation beta-D-Galp-(1----4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1----2)-alpha-D-Man-OMe (4), prepared enzymic galactosylation beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1----2)-alpha-D-Man-OMe (3). Likewise, using 2, alpha-D-Neup-5,9Ac2-(2----6)-beta-D-Galp-(1----4)-D-GlcpNAc (7) obtained N-acetyl-lactosamine (6).
