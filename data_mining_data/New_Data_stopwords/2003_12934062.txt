 Cortical neurons rapidly die necrosis due poor glucose uptake low-density (LD) culture serum-free condition without supplements. scanning transmission electron microscopical analyses characterized necrosis membrane disruption, mitochondrial swelling loss cytoplasmic electron density. High-glucose treatment delayed neuronal death suppressing necrosis, induced apoptosis increase Bax levels, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation DNA ladder formation. Although pyruvate well high glucose inhibited necrotic cell death rapid decrease cellular ATP levels, possibly related decreased [(3)H]-2-deoxy glucose uptake serum-free condition, induce apoptosis. Protein kinase C inhibitors blocked changes related cell death mode switch. Several neurotrophic factors affect necrosis, potentiated high-glucose-induced survival activity, inhibiting cytochrome c release. results suggest high-glucose treatment causes neuronal cell death mode switch inhibiting necrosis, inducing apoptosis, prevented neurotrophic factors.
