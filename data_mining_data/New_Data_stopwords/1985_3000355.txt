 regulatory properties Ca2+-sensitive intramitochondrial enzymes (pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase, NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) extracts rat liver mitochondria appeared essentially similar described previously mammalian tissues. particular, enzymes activated severalfold Ca2+, half-maximal effects 1 microM-Ca2+ (K0.5 value). intact rat liver mitochondria incubated KCl-based medium containing 2-oxoglutarate malate, amount active, non-phosphorylated, pyruvate dehydrogenase could increased severalfold increasing extramitochondrial [Ca2+], provided degree inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (e.g. pyruvate) achieved. rates 14CO2 production 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate non-saturating, saturating, concentrations 2-oxoglutarate liver mitochondria (incubated without ADP) similarly enhanced increasing extramitochondrial [Ca2+]. rates extents NAD(P)H formation liver mitochondria induced non-saturating concentrations 2-oxoglutarate, glutamate, threo-DS-isocitrate citrate also increased similar manner Ca2+ several different incubation conditions, including apparent 'State 3.5' respiration condition. Ca2+ effect NAD(P)H formation induced beta-hydroxybutyrate malate. intact, fully coupled, rat liver mitochondria incubated 10 mM-NaCl 1 mM-MgCl2, apparent K0.5 values extramitochondrial Ca2+ 0.5 microM, effective concentrations within expected physiological range, 0.05-5 microM. absence Na+, Mg2+ both, K0.5 values 400, 200 100 nM respectively. effects increasing extramitochondrial [Ca2+] inhibited Ruthenium Red. extramitochondrial [Ca2+] increased effective ranges enzymes, time-dependent deterioration mitochondrial function ATP content observed. implications results role Ca2+-transport system liver mitochondrial inner membrane discussed.
