 Individual muscle fibers rat anterior tibialis soleus muscles analyzed duplicate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27), malate dehydrogenase (MDH, EC 1.1.1.37), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35), fumarate hydrotase (EC 4.2.1.2), glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1), 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), fructose-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11), creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2). fibers also analyzed adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3). general, wide almost continuous spectrum coordinated enzyme activities. tibialis muscle, two fiber groups could clearly distinguished basis MDH activity. high MDH group average lower LDH activity, great deal overlap LDH two groups. Less overlap observed phosphorylase fructose-bisphosphatase, inversely related MDH. one main group fibers (presumably slow twitch) found soleus muscle, although enzyme activities also covered wide range. soleus fibers clearly distinguished high MDH tibialis group much lower activities LDH, pyruvate kinase, fructose-bisphosphatase.
