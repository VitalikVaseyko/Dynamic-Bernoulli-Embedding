 objective study investigate response sarcoplasmic proteins bovine LM low-voltage electrical stimulation (ES; 80 V, 35 s) dressing contribution meat tenderization early postmortem time. Proteome analysis showed ES resulted decreased (P < 0.05) phosphorylation creatine kinase chain, fructose bisphosphate aldolase C-A, beta-enolase, pyruvate kinase 3 h postmortem. Zymography indicated earlier (P < 0.05) activation mu-calpain ES muscles. Free lysosomal cathepsin B L activity increased faster (P < 0.05) ES muscles 24 h. Immunohistochemistry transmission electron microscopy indicated lysosomal enzymes released early postmortem time. Electrical stimulation also induced ultrastructural disruption sarcomeres. addition, ES accelerated (P < 0.05) depletion ATP, creatine phosphate, glycogen, well pH decline preferred pH/temperature decline mode. Finally, ES accelerated meat tenderization, resulting lesser (P < 0.05) shear force values control testing time. possible relationship suggested change phosphorylation energy metabolic enzymes postmortem tenderization beef. results suggested possible importance activation mu-calpain, phosphorylation sarcoplasmic proteins, release lysosomal enzymes ES-induced tenderization beef muscle.
