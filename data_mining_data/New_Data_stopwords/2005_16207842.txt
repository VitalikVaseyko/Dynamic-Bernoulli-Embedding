 BACKGROUND: autoimmune-mediated mechanism proposed pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated streptococcal infection (PANDAS) Tourette syndrome (TS). Confirmatory evidence has, part, based controversial findings autoantibodies sera children disorders. OBJECTIVE: compare antineuronal antibody profiles subjects TS PANDAS age-matched controls. METHODS: Sera obtained 48 children PANDAS, 46 TS, 43 age-matched controls. Serum autoantibodies measured use ELISA Western immunoblotting variety epitopes, including human postmortem caudate, putamen, prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10). Immunoreactivity also measured commercially available alpha- gamma-enolase, aldolase C, pyruvate kinase M1. Several assays repeated preabsorption sera M6 strain streptococci. RESULTS: Median ELISA optical density readings similar among groups. Western blot analyses showed complex staining patterns differences tissue region based number bands, reactivity peaks molecular weights 98, 60, 45, 40 kDa, total area ScanPack (Biometra, Gottingen, Germany)-derived peaks. Immunoreactivity four putative pathologic antigens differentiate clinical groups. Repeat immunoblotting serum preabsorption streptococci showed loss reactivity. ELISA values exceeding specified cutoff predict changes binding either brain epitopes commercial antigens. CONCLUSIONS: Results support hypothesis PANDAS Tourette syndrome secondary antineuronal antibodies. Longitudinal studies required determine whether autoantibodies correlate fluctuations clinical activity.
