 AIM: Tumor formation generally linked expansion glycolytic phosphometabolite pools aerobic glycolytic flux rates. achieve this, tumor cells generally overexpress special glycolytic isoenzyme, termed pyruvate kinase type M(2). present study designed evaluate use new tumor marker, tumor M(2)-PK, discriminating gastrointestinal cancer patients healthy controls, compare reference tumor markers CEA CA72-4. METHODS: concentration tumor M(2)-PK body fluids could quantitatively determined commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-kit (ScheBo Tech, Giessen, Germany). using kit, tumor M(2)-PK concentration measured EDTA-plasma 108 patients. healthy blood donors cut-off value 15 U/mL evaluated, corresponded 90% specificity. Overall 108 patients included study, 54 patients histological confirmed gastric cancer, 54 patients colorectal cancer, 20 healthy volunteers served controls. RESULTS: cut-off value discriminate patients controls established 15 U/mL tumor M(2)-PK. mean tumor M(2)-PK concentration gastric cancer 26.937 U/mL. According TNM stage system, mean tumor M(2)-PK concentration stage 16.324 U/mL, stage II 15.290 U/mL, stage III 30.289 U/mL, stage IV 127.31 U/mL, non-metastasis 12.854 U/mL metastasis 35.711 U/mL. mean Tumor M(2)-PK concentration colorectal cancer 30.588 U/mL. According Dukes stage system, mean tumor M(2)-PK concentration Dukes 16.638 U/mL, Dukes B 22.070 U/mL, Dukes C 48.024 U/ml, non-metastasis 19.501 U/mL, metastasis 49.437 U/mL. mean tumor M(2)-PK concentration allowed significant discrimination colorectal cancers (30.588 U/mL) controls (10.965 U/mL) (P<0.01), gastric cancer (26.937 U/mL) controls (10.965 U/mL) (P<0.05). overall sensitivity tumor M(2)-PK colorectal cancer 68.52%, CEA 43.12%. gastric cancer, tumor M(2)-PK showed high sensitivity 50.47%, CA72-4 showed sensitivity 35.37%. CONCLUSION: Tumor M(2)-PK higher sensitivity markers CEA CA72-4, valuable tumor marker detection gastrointestinal cancer.
