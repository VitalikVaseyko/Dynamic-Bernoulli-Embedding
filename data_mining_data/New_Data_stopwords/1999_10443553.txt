 activities hexokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase determined brains patients Alzheimer's disease (AD) age matched controls. pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase significant increase specific activity found frontal temporal cortex AD brains, activities aldolase hexokinase changed. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity significantly reduced hippocampus. increase glycolytic enzyme activities correlated increased contents lactate dehydrogenase glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) homogenates frontal temporal cortex elevated phosphofructokinase (PFK) GFAP astrocytes brain areas. data extend previous findings increase brain PFK specific activity AD suggest increased activity glycolytic enzymes may be, least part, result reactive astrocytosis developing course AD.
