 Reliance aerobic glycolysis one hallmarks cancer. Although pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key mediator glycolysis cancer cells, lack selective agents target PKM2 remains challenge exploiting metabolic pathways cancer therapy. report unlike structural analog shikonin, known inhibitor PKM2, lapachol failed induce non-apoptotic cell death ferroxitosis hypoxia. However, melanoma cells treated lapachol showed dose-dependent inhibition glycolysis corresponding increase oxygen consumption. Accordingly, silico studies revealed high affinity-binding pocket lapachol PKM2 structure. Lapachol inhibited PKM2 activity purified enzyme well melanoma cell extracts. Blockade glycolysis lapachol melanoma cells led decreased ATP levels inhibition cell proliferation. Furthermore, perturbation glycolysis melanoma cells lapachol sensitized cells mitochondrial protonophore promoted apoptosis. results present lapachol inhibitor PKM2 interrogate metabolic plasticity tumor cells.
