 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts 85% types lung cancer leading cause world-wide cancer-associated mortalities. Radiation therapy long regarded fundamental therapeutic treatment strategy NSCLC. However, alternative therapies NSCLC remain insufficient, majority cancers developing high incidence radioresistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) endogenous oligonucleotide RNAs serve important role carcinogenesis tumor progression. present study, novel function miR-133b associated radiosensitivity lung cancer cells reported. miR-133 downregulated radioresistant lung cancer cells, exhibited elevated glycolysis rate compared radiosensitive cells. Additionally, observed pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) target miR-133b, expression PKM2 positively correlated radioresistance. Finally, demonstrated overexpression miR-133b resensitizes radioresistant lung cancer cells inhibition PKM2-mediated glycolysis. current study may indicate novel function miR-133b, potentially aiding development anticancer therapeutics.
