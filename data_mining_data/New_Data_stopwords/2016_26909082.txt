 Malignant transformation cells leads enhanced glucose uptake conversion larger fraction pyruvate lactate, even normoxic conditions; phenomenon aerobic glycolysis largely known Warburg effect. metabolic reprograming serves generate biosynthetic precursors, thus facilitating survival rapidly proliferating malignant cells. Extracellular lactate directs metabolic reprograming tumor cells, thereby serving additional selective pressure. Besides tumor cells, stromal cells another source lactate production tumor microenvironment, whose role tumor growth antitumor immune response subject intense research. review, provide integral perspective relationship lactate overall tumor microenvironment, lactate structure metabolic pathways synthesis, receptors, signaling pathways, lactate-producing cells, lactate-responding cells, contribute tumor outcome. discuss role lactate immunosuppressor molecule contributes tumor evasion explore possibility targeting lactate metabolism cancer treatment, well using lactate prognostic biomarker.
