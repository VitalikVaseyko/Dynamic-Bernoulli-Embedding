 1. Rat-liver microsomes, ribonucleoprotein particles fraction mainly consisting microsomal membranes tested ability incorporate amino acids protein presence ATP, GTP, phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. Addition polyuridylic acid ribonucleic acid rat-liver nuclei stimulated incorporating activities. 2. protein-synthesizing systems found susceptible ribonucleic acid chick-liver nuclei well. biological activity ribonucleic acid chick liver measured capacity stimulate amino acid incorporation. 3. presence chick-liver ribonucleic acid, ribonucleoprotein particles rat liver showed increased radioactivity ribosomal units sedimentation constant higher 70s. 4. investigated sucrose-gradient centrifugation column chromatography agarose suspensions.
