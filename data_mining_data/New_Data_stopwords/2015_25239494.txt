 Dysfunctional stem cell differentiation placental lineages associated gestational diseases. differentiated lineages available trophoblast stem cells (TSC), elevated O2 mitochondrial function necessary placental lineages maternal-placental surface important etiology preeclampsia. TSC lineage imbalance leads embryonic failure uterine implantation. Stress implantation exacerbates stem cell depletion decreasing proliferation increasing differentiation. implantation site O2 normally ~2%. culture, exposure 2% O2 fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) enabled highest mouse TSC multipotency proliferation. contrast, hypoxic stress (0.5% O2) initiated TSC differentiation 24h despite exposure FGF4. However, hypoxic stress supported differentiation poorly 4-7 days, despite FGF4 removal. tested O2 levels, FGF4 maintained Warburg metabolism; mitochondrial inactivity aerobic glycolysis. However, hypoxic stress suppressed mitochondrial membrane potential maintained low mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (oxidative phosphorylation/OxPhos), high pyruvate kinase M2 (glycolysis) despite FGF4 removal. Inhibiting OxPhos inhibited optimum differentiation 20% O2. Moreover, adding differentiation-inducing hyperosmolar stress failed induce differentiation hypoxia. Thus, differentiation depended OxPhos 20% O2; hypoxic hyperosmolar stresses induce differentiation 0.5% O2. Hypoxia-limited differentiation mitochondrial inhibition activation suggest differentiation two lineages labyrinthine placenta requires O2>0.5-2% mitochondrial function. Stress-activated protein kinase increases early lineage suppresses later lineages proportion deviation optimal O2 multipotency, thus first enzyme reported prioritize differentiation.
