 L-II element (-149 -126 bp) enhancer unit rat pyruvate kinase L (PKL) gene required cell-type-specific transcription induction carbohydrates. element found bind multiple nuclear proteins different heat stabilities. heat-labile factor shown hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4 electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) using various competitor DNAs anti-HNF4 serum. heat-stable factor purified rat liver nuclear extract resolved two protein bands migrating 33 kDa SDS/polyacrylamide gels. Peptide sequence analysis revealed proteins nuclear factor (NF) 1-L NF1/Red1. heat-stable factor also identified member NF1 family using various competitor DNAs anti-NF1 serum EMSA. addition, found factor bound accessory site rat S14 gene, necessary carbohydrate responsiveness gene, also member NF1 family, raising possibility NF1 family involved carbohydrate regulation gene transcription interactions proteins. NF1 family members HNF4 interacted overlapping sequences L-II element, wherein 5' half-site critical NF1 binding, 3' site important HNF4 binding. Co-transfection vector expressing either NF1-L NF1/Red1 repressed transcription PKL enhancer unit-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene HepG2 cells, whereas co-transfection vector expressing HNF4 activated transcription reporter gene. Furthermore NF1 family members antagonized effect HNF4 PKL enhancer unit-CAT fusion gene expression expression plasmids co-transfected. conclude NF1 family members HNF4 regulate transcription PKL gene opposing manner binding overlapping sequences L-II element.
