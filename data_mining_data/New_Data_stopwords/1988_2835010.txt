 Bovine kidney mitochondrial extracts contain inactive protamine kinase inactive casein kinase. protamine kinase activated chromatography poly(L-lysine)-agarose. Two forms soluble mitochondrial protamine kinase separated chromatography protamine-agarose. forms purified 80,000-fold apparent homogeneity. forms protamine kinase consist single polypeptide chain apparent Mr approximately 45,000. enzyme forms underwent autophosphorylation without significant effect activity, forms exhibited identical substrate specificities. protamine kinase showed little activity toward branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (less 3%), essentially inactive (less 0.1%) pyruvate dehydrogenase, casein, ovalbumin. enzyme active histone H1 bovine serum albumin.
