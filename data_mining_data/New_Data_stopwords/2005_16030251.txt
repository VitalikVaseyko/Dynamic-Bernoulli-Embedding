 Eukaryotic cilia flagella long, thin organelles, diffusion cytoplasm may able support high ATP concentrations needed dynein motor activity. discovered enzyme activities Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagellum catalyze three steps lower half glycolysis (phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase). enzymes generate one ATP molecule every substrate molecule consumed. Flagellar fractionation shows enolase least partially associated axoneme, whereas phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase primarily reside detergent-soluble (membrane + matrix) compartments. show axonemal enolase subunit CPC1 central pair complex reduced flagellar enolase levels cpc1 mutant correlate reduced flagellar ATP concentrations reduced vivo beat frequencies reported previously cpc1 strain. conclude situ ATP synthesis throughout flagellar compartment essential normal flagellar motility.
