 importance PDHK (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) 2 4 regulation PDH complex (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) assessed single- double-knockout mice. PDHK2 deficiency caused higher PDH complex activity lower blood glucose levels fed, fasted, state. PDHK4 deficiency caused similar effects, fasting. Double deficiency intensified effects fed fasted states. PDHK2 deficiency effect glucose tolerance, PDHK4 deficiency produced modest effect, double deficiency caused marked improvement also induced lower insulin levels increased insulin sensitivity. spite beneficial effects, double-knockout mice sensitive wild-type single-knockout mice long-term fasting, succumbing hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis hypothermia. Stable isotope flux analysis indicated hypoglycaemia due reduced rate gluconeogenesis slightly glucose converted ketone bodies double-knockout mice. findings establish PDHK2 important fed state, PDHK4 important fasted state, survival long-term fasting depends upon regulation PDH complex PDHK2 PDHK4.
