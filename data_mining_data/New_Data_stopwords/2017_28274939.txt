 important adaptive feature heat acclimation (HA) induction cross tolerance novel stressors (HACT) Reprogramming gene expression leading enhanced innate cytoprotective features attenuating damage and/or enhancing response "help" signals plays pivotal role. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), constitutively upregulated HA (1 mo, 34 degrees C), crucial transcription factor program, although specific role yet unknown. using rat HA model, studied impact disrupting HIF-1alpha transcriptional activation [HIF-1alpha:HIF-1beta dimerization blockade intraperitoneal acriflavine (4 mg/kg)] mitochondrial gene targets [phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), LON, cyclooxygenase 4 (COX4) isoforms] HA rat heart. Physiological measures cardiac HACT infarct size ischemia-reperfusion time rigor contracture hypoxia cardiomyocytes. show HACT requires transcriptional activation HIF-1alpha throughout course HA activation accompanied two metabolic switches: 1) profound upregulation PDK1, reduces pyruvate entry mitochondria, consequently increasing glycolytic lactate production; 2) remodeling COX4 isoform ratio, inducing hypoxic-tolerant COX4.2 dominance, optimizing electron transfer possibly ATP production ischemic hypoxic insults. LON COX4.2 transcript upregulation accompanied shift. Loss HACT despite elevated expression cytoprotective protein heat shock protein-72 concomitantly disrupted HIF-1alpha dimerization suggests HIF-1alpha essential HACT. role PDK1 metabolic switch well known hypoxia acclimation HA model ischemic setting.
