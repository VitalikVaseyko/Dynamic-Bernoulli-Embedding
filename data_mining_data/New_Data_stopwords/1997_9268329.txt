 Upstream stimulatory factors (USF) 1 2 belong Myc family transcription factors characterized basic/helix loop helix/leucine zipper domain responsible dimerization DNA binding. ubiquitous factors form homo- heterodimers recognize vitro CACGTG core sequence termed E box. binding E boxes target genes, USF factors demonstrated activate gene transcription enhance expression genes response various stimuli. particular, liver USF1 USF2 shown bind vitro glucose/carbohydrate response elements glycolytic lipogenic genes proposed, ex vivo experiments, involved transcriptional activation glucose. However, direct involvement factors gene expression nutrient gene regulation vivo yet demonstrated. Therefore, gain insight specific role USF1 USF2 vivo, particular determine whether USF products required response genes glucose, created, homologous recombination, USF2 -/- mice. paper, provide first evidence USF2 proteins required vivo normal transcriptional response L-type pyruvate kinase Spot 14 genes glucose liver.
