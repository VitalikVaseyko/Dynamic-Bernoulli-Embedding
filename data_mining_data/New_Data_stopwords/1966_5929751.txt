 Burton, Sheril D. (Institute Marine Science, University Alaska, College), Richard Y. Morita, Wayne Miller. Utilization acetate Beggiatoa. J. Bacteriol. 91:1192-1200. 1966.-A proposed system would permit acetate incorporation four-carbon compounds without presence key enzymes citric acid cycle glyoxylate cycle described. system, acetyl-coenzyme (CoA) condensed glyoxylate form malate, which, turn, converted oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate reacts glutamate produce alpha-ketoglutarate, subsequently converted isocitrate. Cleavage isocitrate produces glyoxylate succinate. Thus, proposed system similar glyoxylate bypass malate produced glyoxylate acetyl-CoA, differs citric acid cycle glyoxylate bypass, since citrate fumarate involved. Fumarase, aconitase, catalase, citritase, pyruvate kinase, enolase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, lactic dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, condensing enzyme detectable crude extracts Beggiatoa. Succinate oxidized soluble enzyme associated electron-transport particle. Isocitrate identified sole compound labeled C(14)O(2) added reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, CO(2) generating system (crystalline glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate) presence alpha-ketoglutarate.
