 Thyroid cancer common endocrine malignancy. last decade seen exciting progress understanding thyroid cancer molecular pathogenesis. Several major signaling pathways related molecular derangements elucidated, represent novel diagnostic prognostic molecular markers thyroid cancer. Based molecular biology thyroid cancer, series therapeutic targets developed, provide unprecedented opportunities. Thus, histological characterization subgroups patients correct molecular characterization patients thought key aspects future clinical management patients. present study, identified Slit2 prognostic marker thyroid cancer oncogenesis recurrence. Mechanistically, Slit2 regulated Warburg effect thyroid cancer cells regulation HIF1alpha HIF1alpha transcriptional activity. Taken together, present data uncovered Slit2 novel predictive marker thyroid cancer. mechanism study indicated Slit2 regulated Warburg effect. Additional study function Slit2 thyroid cancer required provide new insights potential mechanisms oncogenesis recurrence potential thyroid cancer.
