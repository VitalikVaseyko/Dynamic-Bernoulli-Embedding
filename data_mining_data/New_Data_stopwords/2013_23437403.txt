 OBJECTIVE: normoxia, non-malignant cells rely oxidative phosphorylation ATP production, whereas cancer cells rely Glycolysis; phenomenon known Warburg effect. aimed elucidate mechanisms contributing Warburg effect human breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes profiled using zymography. LDH-B subunit expression assessed reverse transcription PCR cells, Immunohistochemistry breast tissues. LDH-B promoter methylation assessed sequencing bisulfite modified DNA. RESULTS: Absent decreased expression LDH isoenzymes 1-4, seen T-47D MCF7 cells. Absence LDH-B mRNA seen T-47D cells, expression restored following treatment demethylating agent 5'Azacytadine. LDH-B promoter methylation identified T-47D MCF7 cells, 25/25 cases breast cancer tissues, 5/5 cases normal breast tissues. Absent immuno-expression LDH-B protein (<10% cells stained), seen 23/26 (88%) breast cancer cases, 4/8 cases adjacent ductal carcinoma situ lesions. Exposure breast cancer cells hypoxia (1% O(2)), 48 hours resulted significant increases lactate levels MCF7 (14.0 fold, p = 0.002), T-47D cells (2.9 fold, p = 0.009), MDA-MB-436 (-0.9 fold, p = 0.229), MCF10AT (1.2 fold, p = 0.09) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Loss LDH-B expression early frequent event human breast cancer occurring due promoter methylation, likely contribute enhanced glycolysis cancer cells hypoxia.
