 Fatty acids important ligand peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activation transcriptional regulation metabolic genes. examine whether reduced plasma free fatty acid (FFA) availability affects mRNA content proteins involved fuel metabolism vivo, skeletal muscle mRNA content various transcription factors, transcriptional coactivators genes encoding lipid regulatory proteins examined 3 h cycle exercise (NA) without (CON) pre-exercise ingestion nicotinic acid (NA). NA resulted marked (3- 6-fold) increase (P<0.05) PPARalpha, PPARdelta PPAR coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) mRNA, without effect nuclear respiratory factor-1 Forkhead transcription factor, fatty acid transcolase/CD36, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4. Exercise CON associated increased (P<0.05) PPARalpha, PPARdelta PGC1alpha mRNA, similar magnitude levels observed NA rest. Exercise generally without effect mRNA content lipid regulatory proteins CON affect mRNA content measured subset transcription factors, transcriptional co-activators lipid regulatory proteins NA. determine possible mechanisms NA might affect PGC1alpha expression, measured p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) plasma epinephrine. Phosphorylation p38 MAPK increased (P<0.05) NA treatment rest, correlated (r2=0.84, P<0.01) increased PGC1alpha. Despite close relationship, increasing p38 MAPK human primary myotubes without effect PGC1alpha mRNA content. Plasma epinephrine elevated (P<0.05) NA rest (CON: 0.27+/-0.06, NA: 0.72+/-0.11 nM) throughout exercise. Incubating human primary myotubes epinephrine increased PGC1alpha independently changes p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Hence, despite fact NA ingestion decreased FFA availability, promoted induction PPARalpha/delta PGC1alpha gene expression similar degree prolonged exercise. suggest increase PGC1alpha may due elevated plasma epinephrine levels. Despite changes transcription factors/coactivators, mRNA content lipid regulatory proteins generally unaffected plasma FFA availability.
