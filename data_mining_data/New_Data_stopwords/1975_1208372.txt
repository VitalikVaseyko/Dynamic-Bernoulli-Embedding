 lysine synthesis culture M. glutamicus T-3 nutrient media varying molasses concentrations studied cultivation different aeration conditions. increase nutrient concentration relationship lysine yield aeration rate became manifest. elevation aeration (Kv) 1.2 6.3 g O2 1/hr increased yield lysine 15, 20 28% molasses medium 3, 6 11 times, respectively. decline aeration decreased biomass yield increased content lactic acid alanine culture liquid (to 19 4 g/l, respectively). rate respiration culture filtrate culture liquid measured Warburg apparatus depended cell age molasses concentration nutrient medium aeration rate.
