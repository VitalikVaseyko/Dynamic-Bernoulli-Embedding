 Cancer cells increase glucose uptake reject lactic acid even presence oxygen (Warburg effect). metabolism reorients glucose towards pentose phosphate pathway ribose synthesis consumes great amounts glutamine sustain nucleotide fatty acid synthesis. Oxygenated hypoxic cells cooperate use environment manner promotes development. Coenzymes (NAD(+), NADPH,H(+)) required abundance, whereas continuous consumption ATP citrate precludes negative feedback molecules glycolysis, regulation supporting Pasteur effect. Understanding metabolism cancer cells may help develop new anti-cancer treatments.
