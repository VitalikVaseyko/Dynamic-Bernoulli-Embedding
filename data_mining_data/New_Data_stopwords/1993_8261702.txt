 describe two siblings distal myopathy rimmed vacuoles, died suddenly presumably due fatal arrhythmia. Case 1. 26-year-old man 4 year-history progressive muscle weakness wasting hospitalized April, 1989. family history showed younger brother disease, parents, consanguineous, family members neuromuscular diseases. admission, neurologic examination showed muscle weakness atrophy distal portions four extremities. myotonia fasciculation present. deep tendon reflexes absent except diminished bilateral PTR. Sensation co-ordination normal. creatinine kinase (CK) level moderately elevated 691 IU/l, aldolase mildly 6.9 IU/l. Normal laboratory values included serum electrolytes, glucose thyroid function study. ischemic forearm exercise test revealed normal rise serum lactate pyruvate concentrations. glucose response glucagon normal fasting state. electrocardiogram chest film normal. electromyogram revealed myopathic changes mild neuropathic changes, including positive sharp waves fibrillation potentials rest. muscle biopsy specimen left anterior tibial muscle showed scattered fibers rimmed vacuoles moderate variation fiber size. Neither fiber necrosis inflammatory cellular infiltration seen. Regenerating fiber present. electron microscopic examination showed numerous lamellar bodies various size. Nerve biopsy normal. diagnosed distal myopathy rimmed vacuoles. Muscle weakness progressed gradually next two years, general condition good. asked receive corticosteroid therapy, rehospitalized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
