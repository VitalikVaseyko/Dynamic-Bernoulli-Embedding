 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) second leading cause cancer-related mortality United States. increasing need identification biomarkers pre-malignant early stage CRC improve risk-stratification screening recommendations. study, investigated possibility metabolic mitochondrial reprogramming early pre-malignant colorectal field. METHODS: Rectal biopsies taken 81 patients undergoing screening colonoscopy, gene expression metabolic mitochondrial markers assessed using real time quantitative PCR. Validation studies performed two different animal models colon carcinogenesis: Pirc rats AOM-treated rats. RESULTS: found evidence Warburg effect normal-appearing rectal mucosa patients harboring precancerous lesions elsewhere colon compared control patients, significant increase HIF1alpha, SLC2A1 (referred GLUT1), PKM2, LDHA. also found evidence early mitochondrial changes colorectal field patients harboring pre-cancerous lesions, significantly increased mitochondrial gene expression DRP1 (fission), OPA1 (fusion), PGC1-alpha (biogenesis), UCP2 (uncoupling) mtND1 (copy number). Similar results observed two different animal models. CONCLUSIONS: results demonstrate first time evidence early Warburg-like metabolic changes well changes mitochondrial function, dynamics mtDNA copy number endoscopically normal premalignant colorectal mucosal field. findings provide opportunity development metabolic biomarkers could used improving screening recommendations risk-stratification. also provides potential target novel chemopreventive strategies pre-malignant colorectal field.
