 vitro binding [3H]-AFB1 various proteins studied equilibrium dialysis. 23 +/- 1 degree C, [3H]-AFB1 binding activity (mmol/mol) decreased follows: pyruvate kinase > albumin-NLS > albumin > carbonic anhydrase > RNase > histones. nuclear translocation activation AFB1 AFB-protein complexes investigated using isolated rat liver nuclei presence ATP NADPH regenerating system. Proteins containing NLS histones albumin-NLS facilitated AFB1 translocation nucleus activation adduct formation took place.
