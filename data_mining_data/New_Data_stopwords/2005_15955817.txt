 mathematical model glycolysis bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei developed previously basis available enzyme kinetic data (Bakker, B. M., Michels, P. A. M., Opperdoes, F. R., Westerhoff, H. V. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3207-3215). model predicted correctly fluxes cellular metabolite concentrations measured non-growing trypanosomes major contribution flux control exerted plasma membrane glucose transporter. Surprisingly, large overcapacity predicted hexokinase (HXK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PYK). Here, present analysis control glycolytic flux bloodstream form T. brucei. First, model optimized extended recent information kinetics enzymes activities measured lysates vitro cultured growing trypanosomes. Second, concentrations five glycolytic enzymes (HXK, PFK, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, PYK) trypanosomes changed RNA interference. effects knockdown enzymes growth, activities, levels various enzymes glycolytic flux studied compared model predictions. Data thus obtained support conclusion silico analysis HXK, PFK, PYK excess, albeit less predicted. Interestingly, depletion PFK enolase effect activity (but not, lesser extent, expression) glycolytic enzymes. Enzymes located glycosomes (the peroxisome-like organelles harboring first seven enzymes glycolytic pathway trypanosomes) cytosol affected. data suggest existence novel regulatory mechanisms operating trypanosome glycolysis.
