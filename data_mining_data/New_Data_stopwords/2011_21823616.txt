 Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) represents relevant target cancer therapy light role promoting oncogenesis tumor progression. screening in-house focused compound library, identified N-methyl-3-(1-(4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl)-5-(4'-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]- 4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)propanamide (22) novel ILK inhibitor (IC(50), 0.6 muM), exhibited high vitro potency panel prostate breast cancer cell lines (IC(50), 1-2.5 muM), normal epithelial cells unaffected. Compound 22 facilitated dephosphorylation Akt Ser-473 ILK targets, including glycogen synthase kinase-3beta myosin light chain. Moreover, 22 suppressed expression transcription/translation factor YB-1 targets HER2 EGFR PC-3 cells, could rescued stable expression constitutively active ILK. Evidence indicates 22 induced autophagy apoptosis, integral antiproliferative activity. Together, broad spectrum mechanisms underlies therapeutic potential 22 cancer treatment, manifested vivo efficacy single oral agent suppressing PC-3 xenograft tumor growth.
