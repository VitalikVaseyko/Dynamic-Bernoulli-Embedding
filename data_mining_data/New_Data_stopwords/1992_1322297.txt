 Hepatocyte-hepatoma hybrid cells obtained fusion hepatocytes adult rats Fao hepatoma cells presence polyethylene glycol. hybrids called hepatocytoma cells. preservation liver-specific enzyme activities metabolic functions studied hybrid clone 1E3. 1) proliferating hepatocytoma cells formed monolayers presenting morphological similarity primary cultures hepatocytes. 2) contrast Fao hepatoma cells, activities gluconeogenic key enzymes preserved normal reduced levels. 3) Lactate-dependent glucose formation maintained state reduced 36% gluconeogenesis hepatocytes; glucose formation detected Fao hepatoma cells. 4) activity liver-specific glucokinase reduced hepatocytoma cells, still present contrast Fao cells. liver-specific isoenzyme pyruvate kinase type L replaced isoenzyme type M2. 5) Gluconeogenic glycolytic enzyme activities regulated hepatocytoma cells glucagon (0.1 microM) insulin (0.1 microM). 6) genome hepatocytoma cells expression stable least one year, spontaneously dedifferentiating cells removed recloning hypoxanthine-aminopterine-thymidine (HAT) medium.
