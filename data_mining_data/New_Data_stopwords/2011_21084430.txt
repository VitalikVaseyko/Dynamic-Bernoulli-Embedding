 maize, water stress flowering causes loss kernel set productivity. changes levels sugars abscisic acid (ABA) thought play role stress response, mechanistic basis genes involved known. candidate gene approach used association mapping identify loci involved accumulation carbohydrates ABA metabolites stress. panel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genes metabolic pathways genes reproductive development stress response used genotype 350 tropical subtropical maize inbred lines well watered water stressed flowering. Pre-pollination ears, silks, leaves analysed sugars, starch, proline, ABA, ABA-glucose ester, phaseic acid. ABA sugar levels silks ears negatively correlated growth. Association mapping 1229 SNPs 540 candidate genes identified SNP maize homologue Arabidopsis MADS-box gene, PISTILLATA, significantly associated phaseic acid ears well-watered plants, SNP pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, key regulator carbon flux respiration, associated silk sugar concentration. SNP aldehyde oxidase gene significantly associated ABA levels silks water-stressed plants. Given short range decay linkage disequilibrium occurs maize, results indicate allelic variation genes affects ABA carbohydrate metabolism floral tissues drought.
