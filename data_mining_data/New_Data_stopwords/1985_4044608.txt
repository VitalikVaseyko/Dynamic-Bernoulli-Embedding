 Hepatocytes, isolated fasted rats, incubated graded concentrations lactate pyruvate, mean constant ratio 10-13:1, alter systematically concentrations gluconeogenic intermediate metabolites rates glucose production. analyzing glucose production rates function corresponding concentrations extracellular pyruvate, cytosolic oxalacetate, cellular 3-phosphoglycerate presence absence hormones assuming primary activation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, estimates made relative contributions stimulation formation cytosolic oxalacetate inhibition pyruvate kinase hormonal stimulations gluconeogenesis. Addition dexamethasone, glucagon, angiotensin II cause shift relationship cellular 3-phosphoglycerate concentrations rates glucose production, indicating effect agents reactions involved conversion phosphoenolpyruvate glucose. three agents shifted relationships rates glucose production cytosolic oxalacetate extracellular pyruvate. following conclusions drawn computer analyses results. low concentrations pyruvate, stimulation oxalacetate production pyruvate kinase inhibition approximately equally contributory overall stimulations gluconeogenesis angiotensin II dexamethasone. higher pyruvate concentrations, pyruvate kinase inhibition angiotensin II played greater role, accounting 90% overall stimulation. dexamethasone, pyruvate concentration increased, stimulation gluconeogenesis resulting enhanced formation oxalacetate diminished overall stimulation gluconeogenesis. Glucagon addition resulted inhibition pyruvate kinase flux accounted 75% hormone's overall effect low pyruvate concentrations; increased 95% high pyruvate concentrations.
