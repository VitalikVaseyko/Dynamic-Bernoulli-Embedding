 glycolytic fermentation molluscs rather complex. Multiple end products accumulate (lactate, alanine, octopine, succinate, propionate, acetate CO2), partly formed cytoplasm partly mitochondrion. Various schemes presented account end products well maintenance redox balance. respect role alanine two opinions: (1) alanine accumulation continuous essential generation mitochondrial NADH required reduction fumarate (2) succinate alanine (initial end products) accumulate different compartments accumulation occurs independently. statements evaluated light latest experimental observations including regulatory properties phosphoenolpyruvate branchpoint effect pH 'energy charge'. nervous tissue function oxygen replaced lipochrome pigment, enables carbohydrates totally oxidized CO2 water. simultaneous mobilization carbohydrates amino acids supported experimental data. Various advantages glycolytic fermentation molluscs compared classical glycolysis skeletal muscle discussed.
