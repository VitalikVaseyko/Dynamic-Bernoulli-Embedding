 transition metal cadmium pervasive persistent environmental contaminant shown human toxicant carcinogen. inhibit cadmium-induced damage, cells respond increasing expression genes encoding stress-response proteins. cases, mechanism cadmium affects expression genes remains unknown. demonstrated several instances cadmium activates gene transcription signal transduction pathways, mediated protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, calmodulin. codicil cadmium influence expression numerous genes. investigate ability cadmium affect gene transcription, differential display technique used analyze gene expression nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Forty-nine cDNAs whose steady-state levels expression change 2-6-fold response cadmium exposure identified. nucleotide sequences majority differentially expressed cDNAs identical C. elegans cosmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, expressed sequence tags, predicted genes. translated amino acid sequences several clones identical C. elegans metallothionein-1, HSP70, collagens, rRNAs. addition, C. elegans homologues pyruvate carboxylase, DNA gyrase, beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, human hypothetical protein KIAA0174 identified. translated amino acid sequences remaining differentially expressed cDNAs encode novel proteins.
