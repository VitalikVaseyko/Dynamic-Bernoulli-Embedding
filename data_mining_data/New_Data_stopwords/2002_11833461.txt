 number tissues brain must continuously provided glucose meet energy demand. contrast, carbohydrate absorption meals discontinuous process. Thus, must store glucose provided, release spare less abundant. Insulin, secreted pancreatic beta-cell key hormone adaptations metabolic pathways linked glucose homeostasis. inhibits hepatic glucose production, promotes glucose storage liver glucose uptake storage muscles adipose tissues. achieved modifications activity existing proteins (enzymes, transporters) also regulation gene expression. liver, diet rich carbohydrates, insulin secreted stimulates expression genes involved glucose utilization (glucokinase, L-pyruvate kinase, lipogenic enzymes) inhibits genes involved glucose production (phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase). mechanisms insulin controls expression genes poorly understood. Recently, transcription factor Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1c (SREBP-1c) proposed key mediator insulin transcriptional effects. Insulin increases synthesis nuclear abundance factor overexpressed liver mimics effects insulin insulin-sensitive genes. suggests SREBP-1c could involved pathologies type 2 diabetes, obesity generally insulin resistance syndromes.
