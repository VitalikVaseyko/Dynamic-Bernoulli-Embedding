 Although classical view proteins function relied well folded structures, recognized functions many proteins dependent intrinsically disordered. primary consideration work intermediate group proteins overall well folded, contain small regions undergo order-disorder transitions. particular, current focus order-disorder transitions energetically coupled ligand binding. exemplified case human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK), peptides mimic sequence order-disorder region used allosteric regulators enzyme. basis example others reported literature, propose similar use peptides mimic protein regions experience ligand-dependent order-disorder transitions generalized initiation point development allosteric drugs.
