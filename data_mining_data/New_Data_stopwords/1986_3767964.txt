 alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase succinyl-CoA synthetase phosphorylated incubation cardiac mitochondria genetically diabetic mice [gamma-32P]ATP. significantly increased incorporation 32P pyruvate dehydrogenase diabetic mice compared controls. enhanced rate pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation correlates well previously reported defective oxidative metabolism decreased activity enzyme diabetic mice. relationship abnormal mitochondrial function development cardiomyopathy diabetic mice studied vivo estrone treatment. results indicate ultrastructural alterations myocardium closely associated defective pyruvate oxidation (via phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase) processes prevented 7-12 weeks estrone treatment.
