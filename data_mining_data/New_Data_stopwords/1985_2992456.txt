 Transitions glycolytic gluconeogenic states investigated open homogeneous enzyme system containing phosphofructokinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase glucose 6-phosphate isomerase. direction substrate flow found depend maximum activities phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase well influx concentrations fructose 6-phosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. high low maximum activities phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase unique stable stationary states occur, whereas intermediate enzyme concentrations sustained oscillations emerge. Stationary states low rate substrate cycling demand appropriate enzyme concentrations adequate substrate supply. Accordingly, transitions efficient glycolytic gluconeogenic states require changes enzyme concentrations supply substrates. transitions exhibit transient oscillatory response. sustained oscillations generated intermediate activities phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase lead significant diminution rate substrate cycling compared respective steady state values. oscillations glycolytic gluconeogenic states consecutively passed through. temporal organization antagonistic reactions achieved. system kinetic organization two opposite reactions mainly brought reciprocal allosteric effects AMP activities two enzymes.
