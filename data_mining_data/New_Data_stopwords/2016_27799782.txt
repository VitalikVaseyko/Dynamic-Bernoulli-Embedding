 highly regulated pH cells less-regulated pH surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) result delicate balance metabolic processes proton production, proton transportation, chemical buffering, vascular removal waste products. Malignant cells show pronounced increase metabolic processes 10- 15-fold rise glucose consumption tip iceberg. Aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) one hallmarks cancer metabolism implies excessive production protons, stayed inside cells would result fatal intracellular acidosis (maintaining strict acid-base balance essential survival eukaryotic cells). Malignant cells solve problem increasing mechanisms proton transportation expel excess acidity. allows cancer cells keep normal intracellular pH, even overshooting mechanism permits slightly alkaline intracellular tendency. proton excess expelled malignant cells accumulates ECM, chronic hypoxia relative lack enough blood vessels impede adequate proton clearance, thus creating acidic microenvironment. microenvironment quite heterogeneous due tumor's metabolic heterogeneity variable degrees hypoxia inside tumor mass. acidic environment (plus necessary cellular modifications) stimulates migration invasion finally intravasation malignant cells eventually may result metastasis. Targeting tumor pH may go two directions: 1) increasing extracellular pH result less migration, invasion, metastasis; 2) decreasing intracellular pH may result acidic stress apoptosis. objectives seem achievable present state art repurposed drugs. hypothesis analyzes altered pH tumors implications progression metastasis also possible repurposed drug combinations targeting vulnerable side cancer development. also analyzes double-edged approach, consists pharmacologically increasing intracellular proton production simultaneously decreasing proton extrusion creating intracellular acidity, acid stress, eventual apoptosis.
