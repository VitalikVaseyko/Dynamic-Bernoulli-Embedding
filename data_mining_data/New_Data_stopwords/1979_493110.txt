 Blood donors Centre Regional de Transfusion Sanguine de Rennes investigated phenotypic distribution seven enzymatic systems : adenylate kinase, adenosine deaminase, esterase D, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, phosphoglucomutase, glyoxalase I. Two unusual phenotypes observed: phenotype 6-1 adenosine deaminase phenotype 3-1 transaminase GPT. five enzymes, statistical analysis points significant differences one several European populations described literature.
