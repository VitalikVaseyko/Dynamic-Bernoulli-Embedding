 BACKGROUND/AIMS: (-)-Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) shown suppress fat accumulation animals humans, underlying biochemical mechanism fully understood, especially little information available whether (-)-HCA regulates energy metabolism consequently affects fat deposition. METHODS: Hepatocytes cultured 24 h exposed (-)-HCA (0, 1, 10, 50 microM), enzyme protein content determined ELISA; lipid metabolism gene mRNA levels detected RT-PCR. RESULTS: (-)-HCA significantly decreased number total area lipid droplets. ATP-citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c mRNA level significantly decreased (-)-HCA treatment, whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha mRNA level significantly increased. (-)-HCA significantly decreased ATP-citrate lyase activity acetyl-CoA content cytosol, significantly increased glucose consumption mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. (-)-HCA promoted activity/content glucokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase ATP synthase remarkably. CONCLUSIONS: (-)-HCA decreased lipid droplets accumulation reducing acetyl-CoA supply, mainly achieved via inhibition ATP-citrate lyase, accelerating energy metabolism chicken hepatocytes. results proposed biochemical mechanism fat reduction (-)-HCA broiler chickens term energy metabolism.
