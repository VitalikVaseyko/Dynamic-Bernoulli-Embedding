 1. investigation reaction mechanism fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-activated pyruvate kinase isolated hepatopancreas crab Carcinus maenas conducted. enzyme assayed presence 500 microns-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 75 mM-KCl 8 mM-Mg2+free 25 degrees C. results consistent rapid-equilibrium random mechanism. 2. Evidence presented suggests formation two mixed-substrate-product dead-end complexes, enzyme-ADP-pyruvate enzyme-ADP-ATP. 3. Competitive substrate inhibition observed substrates, ADP phosphoenolpyruvate, suggesting formation complexes enzyme-ADP-ADP enzyme-phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate suggested mechanism. 4. Data ATP product-inhibition studies indicate formation complex enzyme-ATP-ATP. suggests reverse reaction ATP also show substrate inhibition. 5. presence saturating concentration fructose 1,6-bisphosphate cause full activation purified preparations enzyme. 6. Pyruvate kinase activity supernatant hepatopancreas homogenate completely activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, suggesting binding ligand purified pyruvate kinase impaired.
