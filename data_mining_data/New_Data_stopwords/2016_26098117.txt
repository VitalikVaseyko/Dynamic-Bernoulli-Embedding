 Lysine residues post-translationally modified various acyl modifications bacteria eukarya. Here, showed two major acyl modifications, acetylation succinylation, changed response carbon source Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Acetylation common cells grown glucose, glycerol, pyruvate, whereas succinylation upregulated cells grown citrate, reflecting metabolic states preferentially produce acetyl-CoA succinyl-CoA, respectively. identify quantify changes acetylation succinylation response carbon source, performed stable isotope labeling amino acids cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomic analysis cells grown glucose citrate. identified 629 acetylated proteins 1355 unique acetylation sites 204 succinylated proteins 327 unique succinylation sites. Acetylation targeted different metabolic pathways two growth conditions: branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis purine metabolism glucose citrate cycle citrate. Succinylation preferentially targeted citrate cycle citrate. Acetylation succinylation mostly targeted different lysine residues showed preference different residues surrounding modification sites, suggesting two modifications may depend different factors characteristics acyl-group donors, molecular environment lysine substrate, and/or modifying enzymes. Changes acetylation succinylation observed proteins involved central carbon metabolism components transcription translation machineries, RNA polymerase ribosome. Mutations modulate protein acylation affected B. subtilis growth. mutation acetate kinase (ackA) increased global acetylation level, suggesting acetyl phosphate-dependent acetylation common B. subtilis, Escherichia coli. results suggest acyl modifications play role physiological adaptations changes carbon nutrient availability B. subtilis.
