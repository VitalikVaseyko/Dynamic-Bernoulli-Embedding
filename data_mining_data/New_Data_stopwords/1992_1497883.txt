 Xenopus eggs contain large stores glycogen, glycogen glycolytically processed cleavage. Embden-Meyerhof pathway inhibited absence pyruvate kinase activity vivo, lactate pyruvate present relatively low levels. late blastula, preceding gastrulation, lactate levels increase, indicating onset glycogen breakdown glycolytic flux. Glycolysis microinjected [14C]glucose-6-phosphate could transiently activated, however, coinjection ADP fertilized eggs, constitutively activated injection ATPase potato apyrase, indicating presence enzymes necessary glycolytic activity. isozyme profiles pyruvate kinase malic enzyme, two enzymes involved carbon metabolism cleavage subsequent activation glycogen breakdown, change egg gastrula stages. data suggest activation glycogen breakdown glycolysis late blastula probably result new gene activity may metabolic consequence increased free ADP able support pyruvate kinase reaction.
