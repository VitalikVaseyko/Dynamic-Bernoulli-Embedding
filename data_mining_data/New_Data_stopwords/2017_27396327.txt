 Understanding fiber-type specification metabolic switch skeletal muscle provides insights energy metabolism physiology diseases. Here, show miR-182 highly expressed fast-twitch muscle negatively correlates blood glucose level. miR-182 knockout mice display muscle loss, fast-to-slow fiber-type switching, impaired glucose metabolism. Mechanistic studies reveal miR-182 modulates glucose utilization muscle targeting FoxO1 PDK4, control fuel selection via pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). Short-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding reduces muscle miR-182 levels tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), contributes upregulation FoxO1/PDK4. Restoration miR-182 expression HFD-fed mice induces faster muscle phenotype, decreases muscle FoxO1/PDK4 levels, improves glucose metabolism. Together, work establishes miR-182 critical regulator confers robust precise controls fuel usage glucose homeostasis. study suggests metabolic shift toward faster glycolytic phenotype beneficial glucose control.
