 study investigates effect overexpression key glycolytic enzymes exhibiting either native alternative allosteric regulation glucose bioconversion resting Escherichia coli cells previously engineered ethanol production. Homologous heterologous pyruvate kinases (Pyk) phosphofructokinases (Pfk) individually simultaneously overexpressed. Overexpression E. coli Pfk led shift ethanol lactate formation (three-fold control level) overexpression Pyks accelerated lactate formation two-fold less reduction ethanol formation. increase lactate formation (five-fold control level) resulted overexpression Pfk Lactobacillus bulgaricus which, unlike E. coli Pfk, allosterically regulated either phosphoenolpyruvate ADP. effects carbon flux distribution accompanied significant changes intracellular concentrations several glycolytic intermediates. Increased Pfk levels led primarily reduced levels hexose phosphates. Increased Pyk activity resulted complex changes different overexpressed native Pyk overexpressed Bacillus stearothermophilus Pyk, differs E. coli Pyk lacking activation fructose 1,6-diphosphate, allosterically activated AMP ribose 5-phosphate. Simultaneous overexpression native Pfk Pyk caused Pfk-overexpression-like phenotype lower levels hexose phosphates increased lactate formation (nine-fold control level). flux data demonstrate overexpression even single enzymes early central pathway increase fluxes particular metabolic product, although may affect glucose uptake rate.
