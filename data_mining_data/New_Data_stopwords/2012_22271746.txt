 green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii numerous genes encoding enzymes function fermentative pathways. Among these, bifunctional alcohol/acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH1), highly homologous Escherichia coli AdhE enzyme, proposed key component fermentative metabolism. investigate physiological role ADH1 dark anoxic metabolism, Chlamydomonas adh1 mutant generated. detected ethanol synthesis mutant placed anoxia; two ADH homologs encoded Chlamydomonas genome appear participate ethanol production experimental conditions. Pyruvate formate lyase, acetate kinase, hydrogenase protein levels similar wild-type cells adh1 mutant, mutant significantly pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Furthermore, marked change metabolite levels (in addition ethanol) synthesized mutant anoxic conditions observed; formate levels reduced, acetate levels elevated, production CO(2) significantly reduced, fermentative H(2) production unchanged relative wild-type cells. particular interest finding mutant accumulates high levels extracellular glycerol, requires NADH substrate synthesis. Lactate production also increased slightly mutant relative control strain. findings demonstrate restructuring fermentative metabolism adh1 mutant way sustains recycling (oxidation) NADH survival mutant (similar wild-type cell survival) dark anoxic growth.
