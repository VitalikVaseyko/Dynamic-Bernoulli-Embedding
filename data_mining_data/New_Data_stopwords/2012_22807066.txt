 Pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) reported involved aerobic glycolysis cell growth various tumors. However, expression pattern PKM2 colorectal cancer (CRC) correlation PKM2 expression CRC remains unclear. aim study investigate PKM2 expression possible role CRC. found expression PKM2 increased CRC increased PKM2 expression associated later stage lymph metastasis tumors. Knockdown PKM2 suppressed aerobic glycolysis decreased lactate production colon cancer RKO cells. Knockdown PKM2 repressed proliferation migration cells. Inhibition PKM2 suppressed xenograft tumor growth RKO cells vivo. results suggest expression PKM2 plays critical role development CRC, may provide growth advantage colon cancer cells. Thus, PKM2 might potential therapeutic target CRC.
