 13 major enzymes compose glycolytic fermentative pathways Zymomonas mobilis particularly abundant represent one-half soluble protein exponential-phase cells. One- two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis maps developed 12 enzymes. Assignments made comigration purified proteins, comparison overexpressed genes recombinant strains, Western blots (immunoblots). Although glycolytic enzymes appeared resistant turnover accumulated stationary-phase cells, protein levels pyruvate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase I, glucokinase declined. Alcohol dehydrogenase II identified major stress protein induced exposure ethanol elevated temperature (45 degrees C). enzyme, encoded adhB gene, expressed tandem promoters share partial sequence identity Escherichia coli consensus sequence heat shock proteins.
