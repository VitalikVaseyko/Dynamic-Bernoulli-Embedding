 Oxygen-induced lung toxicity studied newborn rats. Three-day-old rats exposed 85-90% oxygen air 48 h. activity pulmonary antioxidant defenses, measured activity superoxide dismutase (SOD), showed progressive increase activity. activity phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAPase) showed statistically significant decrease oxygen-poisoned lung. activity pulmonary pyruvate kinase significant change occurred. two days oxygen exposure (FiO2 085-0.9) marked histological changes appeared including increased number interstitial cells, atelectasis, pulmonary oedema, diminution lamellar content, loose lamellar bodies increasing tubular myelin alveolar space.
