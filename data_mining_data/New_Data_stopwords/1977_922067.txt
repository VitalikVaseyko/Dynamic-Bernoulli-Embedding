 conversion reaction two cytoplasmic glycolysis enzymes, phosphoglycerate mutase phosphopyruvate hydratase, necessary sucrose synthesis pyruvate leaves C4-plants light, phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis pyruvate phosphoglycerate reduction carried chloroplasts. Leaves C4-plants differ C3-plants higher activity cytoplasmic glycolysis enzymes, distributed irregularly two assimilatory tissues. ratio pyruvate kinase enolase reaction activities high parenchyma linings vascular fascicles (where mitochondria concentrated), low mesophyl tissue, phosphoglucerate equilibrium phosphoenolpyruvate reaction included photosynthetic metabolism. data obtained isolated mesophyl protoplasts shown reaction equilibrium sharply shifted direction phosphoenolpyruvate formation phosphoglycerate. However, incorporation 14C sugars completely inhibited atmosphere N2-A possibility incorporation tri-carbon fragments sugars photosynthesizing leaves via conversion enolase reaction via alternative pathways discussed.
