 Multiple cellular signaling pathways control metabolism survival activated cell incubated hypoxic conditions. Activation hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 promotes expression genes increase capacity cope stress imposed reduced oxygen environment. show orphan nuclear receptor estrogen related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) plays critical role hypoxia-mediated activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene expression. ERRgamma mRNA protein levels increased hypoxia desferrioxamine (DFO) treatment hepatoma cell lines. Co-expression HIF-1alpha beta increased ERRgamma promoter activity well mRNA expression, knockdown endogenous HIF-1alpha reduced hypoxia-mediated induction ERRgamma. addition, hypoxia also increased promoter activity mRNA level PDK4 HepG2 cells. Adenovirus mediated-overexpression ERRgamma specifically increased PDK4 gene expression, ablation endogenous ERRgamma significantly decreased hypoxia-mediated induction PDK4 gene expression. Finally, GSK5182, inverse agonist ERRgamma, strongly inhibited hypoxia-mediated induction PDK4 protein promoter activity. Regulation transcriptional activity ERRgamma may provide therapeutic approach regulation PDK4 gene expression hypoxia.
