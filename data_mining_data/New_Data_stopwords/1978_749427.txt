 toxic effect metal ions cadmium, zinc, nickel mercury tetracyanide salt complexes, activated sludge previously acclimated, studied. evaluation effect carried using Warburg TTC-method. results obtained shown toxicity cadmium zinc complexes higher corresponding metals, toxicity Ni(CN)4(2-) lower corresponding metals. differences found effect mercury corresponding tetracyanide complex. data obtained appears possible generalize biological effect complexation CN- group, stated that, generally, substantial differences metals cyanide complexes far toxicity activated sludge concerned.
