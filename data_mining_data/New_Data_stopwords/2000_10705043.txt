 Aging affects metabolic capacity skeletal muscle, particular glycolytic respiratory capacities. purpose study quantify biochemical alterations due aging muscular metabolic capacity human skeletal muscles sedentary subjects. activities various marker enzymes metabolites related glycolysis, Krebs' cycle electron transfer chain high energy phosphate compounds measured muscle biopsies rectus abdominis, vastus lateralis, gluteus maximus muscles 76 sedentary subjects (32 males 44 females) 15 91 yr. significant differences males females found, changes related age were: decrease hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase activities rectus abdominis; decrease citrate synthase activity citrate vastus lateralis; increase pyruvate kinase activity decrease ATP creatine phosphate concentrations gluteus maximus. data suggest distinct muscles may respond differently aging regardless sex sedentary subjects.
