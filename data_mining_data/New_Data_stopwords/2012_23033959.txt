 : Bacterial strains genetically blocked important metabolic pathways grown selective conditions underwent process adaptive evolution: certain pathways may deregulated therefore allowed circumvention given block. block endogenous pyruvate synthesis glycerol realized knockout pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase E. coli. resulting mutant strain able grow medium containing glycerol lactate, served exogenous pyruvate source. Heterologous expression pyruvate carboxylase gene Corynebacterium glutamicum used anaplerosis TCA cycle. Selective conditions controlled continuous culture limited lactate feed excess glycerol feed. 200-300 generations pyruvate-prototrophic mutants isolated. genomic analysis evolved strain revealed genotypic basis regained pyruvate-prototrophy obvious. constraint-based model metabolism employed compute possible detours around given metabolic block solving hierarchy linear programming problems. regulatory network expected responsible adaptation process. Hence, Boolean model transcription factor network connected metabolic model. model analysis showed marginal impact transcriptional control biomass yield substrate key variable selection process. experiment, microarray analysis confirmed transcriptional control probably played minor role deregulation alternative pathways circumvention block.
