 Cancer cells exhibit profound metabolic alterations, allowing fulfill metabolic needs come increased proliferation additional facets malignancy. metabolic transformation orchestrated genetic changes drive tumorigenesis, is, activation oncogenes and/or loss oncosuppressor genes, shaped environmental cues, oxygen concentration nutrient availability. Understanding metabolic rewiring essential elucidate fundamental mechanisms tumorigenesis well find novel, therapeutically exploitable liabilities malignant cells. Here, describe key features metabolic transformation cancer cells, frequently include switch aerobic glycolysis, profound mitochondrial reprogramming, deregulation lipid metabolism, highlighting notion pathways independent rather cooperate sustain proliferation. Finally, hypothesize genetic defects effectively support anabolism selected course tumor progression, implying cancer-associated mutations may undergo metabolically convergent evolution.
