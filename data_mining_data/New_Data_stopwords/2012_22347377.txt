 BACKGROUND: Clotrimazole azole derivative promising anti-cancer effects. drug interferes activity glycolytic enzymes altering cellular distribution inhibiting activities. aim present study analyze effects clotrimazole growth pattern breast cancer cells correlating metabolic profiles. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three cell lines derived human breast tissue (MCF10A, MCF-7 MDA-MB-231) present increasingly aggressive profiles used. Clotrimazole induces dose-dependent decrease glucose uptake three cell lines, K(i) values 114.3+/-11.7, 77.1+/-7.8 37.8+/-4.2 microM MCF10A, MCF-7 MDA-MB-231, respectively. Furthermore, drug also decreases intracellular ATP content inhibits major glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1 pyruvate kinase, especially highly metastatic cell line, MDA-MB-231. last cell lineage, clotrimazole attenuates robust migratory response, effect progressively attenuated MCF-7 MCF10A, respectively. Moreover, clotrimazole reduces viability breast cancer cells, pronounced MDA-MB-231. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Clotrimazole presents deleterious effects two human breast cancer cell lines metabolism, growth migration, aggressive cell line affected drug. Moreover, clotrimazole presents little effect non-tumor human breast cell line. results suggest, least three cell lines studied, aggressive cell effective clotrimazole is.
