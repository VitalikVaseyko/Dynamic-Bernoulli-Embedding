 recent research cancer research demonstrates tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays important role chromosome segregation mitosis progression tumor cells. improve drug development TCM compounds, aim identify potent TCM compounds lead compounds PKM2 regulators. PONDR-Fit protocol utilized predict disordered disposition binding domain PKM2 protein virtual screening disordered structure protein may cause side effect downregulation possibility ligand bind target protein. MD simulation performed validate stability interactions PKM2 proteins ligand virtual screening. top TCM compounds, saussureamine C precatorine, extracted Lycium chinense Mill. Abrus precatorius L., respectively, higher binding affinities target protein docking simulation control. stable H-bonds residues A:Lys311 residues chains PKM2 protein. Hence, propose TCM compounds, saussureamine C precatorine, potential candidates lead compounds study drug development process PKM2 protein cancer.
