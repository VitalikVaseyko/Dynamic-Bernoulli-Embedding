 OBJECTIVE: detect proteins associated effect ganoderma lucidium spores (GASP) promoting survival axon regeneration injured spinal motor neurons rats. METHODS: rats divided normal control group, untreated group GASP-treated group, rats last two groups received ventral root avulsion. GASP preparation fed rats GASP-treated group 14 days. gray matter tissues lumbar spinal sampled rats group 14 days following ventral root avulsion, extracted proteins tissues detected using 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) utilized identify differentially expressed proteins among three groups. RESULTS: six kinds proteins differentially expressed among three groups, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2), F-actin capping protein beta subunit (FCP-beta), isocitrate dehydrogenase [NAD] subunit beta (IDH-beta), ATPase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase-1 (GOT1) M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). expression levels CRMP-2, IDH-beta, ATPase GOT1 higher GASP-treated group untreated group, expression levels FCP-beta M2-PK lower untreated group. CONCLUSION: GASP maybe promotes survival axon regeneration injured spinal motor neurons rats virtue up- down-regulating expression levels proteins mentioned above.
