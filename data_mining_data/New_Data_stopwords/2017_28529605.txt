 Warburg effect one major metabolic changes cancer cells, characterized high level glycolysis even presence oxygen. However, role microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating glycolytic switch cancer cells well explored. study, demonstrated miR-199a-5p acts suppressor Warburg effect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MiR-199a-5p directly targets 3'-untranslated region (UTR) hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), thereby suppressing glucose uptake, lactate production, cell growth, expression HIF-1alpha downstream glycolytic genes HCC cells. Moreover, hypoxic conditions, expression miR-199a-5p suppressed up-regulation HIF-1alpha. Thus, mutual regulation miR-199a-5p HIF-1alpha forms positive feedback loop promote glycolysis HCC cells. Furthermore, miR-199a-5p down-regulated human HCC tissues low-level expression associated worse survival patients HCC. findings suggest miR-199a-5p/HIF-1alpha axis critical regulation Warburg effect also implicate miR-199a-5p potential therapeutic target HCC.
