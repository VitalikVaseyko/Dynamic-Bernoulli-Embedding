 work aims identification relevant intermediate metabolism enzymes contributing improved meat production due genetic selection. wild rabbit (WR) breed highly meat selected breed (New Zealand (NZ) rabbit) used. Food restriction used experimental condition enhance differences within metabolic pathways study. period 30 days, NZ WR experimental breeds subjected to, respectively, 40% 60% ad libitum food restriction leading 17.7% 21.1% initial weight. Hepatic glycolytic, lipidic protein regulatory enzyme activity, transcriptional metabolite levels determined. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), triiodothyronine, cortisol also evaluated. glycolytic pathways, NZ control rabbits presented higher phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activity level compared WR, latter group showed higher expression glycogen synthase, although less glycogen content. nitrogen metabolism, results showed lower activity level glutamate dehydrogenase WR subjected food restriction. Within lipid metabolism, results showed although WR significantly higher mRNA hepatic lipase, non-esterified fatty acid levels similar experimental groups. NZ rabbits presented better glycemia control greater energy substrate availability leading enhanced productivities triiodothyronine IGF-1 played relevant role.
