 Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) principal viral oncoprotein Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), acts regulating tumorigenesis metabolic reprogramming cancers. presence oxygen, demonstrated glucose consumption, lactate production lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity significantly increased upon LMP1 expression NPC cells LMP1 variant derived NPC patients-transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells. amounts alpha subunit hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1alpha), key regulator aerobic glycolysis, targets, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform, also consistently elevated LMP1. Moreover, parallel reductions oxygen consumption rate mitochondrial membrane potential cells, augmented extracellular lactate concentration observed due LMP1 induction. conclusion, results proved facilitation Warburg effect LMP1 alteration mitochondrial function NPC cells.
