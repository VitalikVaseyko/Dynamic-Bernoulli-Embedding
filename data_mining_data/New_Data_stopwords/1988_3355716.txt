 Low ionic strength extraction (37 degrees C, 30 min) ghosts PK-deficient erythrocytes provided crude spectrin extract. significant differences extract composition compared normal donors observed. reticulocyte-dependent spectrin extractability found among subjects PK-deficiency anemia. Likewise ATP-depletion affects spectrin extractability also leads adsorption cytoplasmic protein MW 50,000 reticulocyte membrane. measurement membrane fluidity using fluorescence probe DPH reveal significant alterations moiety integral membrane constituents.
