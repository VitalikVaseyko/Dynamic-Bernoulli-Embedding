 Pneumococcus shown bind epithelial cells nasopharynx lung, endothelial cells peripheral vasculature. characterize bacterial elements required attachment cell types, library genetically altered pneumococci defects exported proteins screened loss attachment glycoconjugates representative nasopharyngeal cell receptor, type II lung cells (LC) human endothelial cells (EC). mutant identified showed greater 70% loss ability attach cell types. mutant also showed decreased adherence glycoconjugates containing terminal sugar residues GalNAcbeta1-3Gal, GalNAcbeta1-4Gal carbohydrate GlcNAc, proposed components pneumococcal receptors specific surfaces LC EC. Analysis locus altered mutant revealed gene, spxB, encodes member family bacterial pyruvate oxidases decarboxylates pyruvate acetyl phosphate plus H2O2 CO2. mutant produced decreased concentrations H2O2 failed grow aerobically chemically defined medium, unless supplemented acetate presumably restores acetyl phosphate levels action acetate kinase, suggesting spxB encodes pyruvate oxidase. addition acetate growth medium restored adherence properties mutant indicating link enzyme expression bacterial adhesins. defect spxB corresponded impaired virulence mutant vivo. Compared parent strain, spxB mutant showed reduced virulence animal models nasopharyngeal colonization, pneumonia, sepsis. propose mutation spxB leads down-regulation multiple adhesive properties pneumococcus which, turn, may correlate diminished virulence vivo.
