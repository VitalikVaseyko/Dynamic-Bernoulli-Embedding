 assess whether glucosensing capacity peripheral (liver Brockmann bodies) central (hypothalamus hindbrain) locations rainbow trout displays day-night variations response changes circulating glucose levels, evaluated response parameters related glucosensing [glucose, glycogen glucose 6-phosphate levels, activities glucokinase (GK), glycogen synthetase (GSase) pyruvate kinase (PK), mRNA abundance GK, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), K(ATP) channel subunits Kir6.x-like sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)-like] fish subjected hyperglycemic treatment night day conditions. day-night significant variations noticed glucosensing capacity hypothalamus, hindbrain Brockmann bodies. contrast, clear differential response noticed liver, glucose levels, GK activity (and mRNA levels) GSase activity displayed increased values day hyperglycemic fish compared controls, lower (GK mRNA levels) non-existent (glucose, GK GSase activities, Kir6.x-like mRNA levels) values night. similar decrease parameters related glucosensing liver observed fish day conditions treated melatonin, suggesting modulatory role melatonin day-night changes glucosensing response tissue.
