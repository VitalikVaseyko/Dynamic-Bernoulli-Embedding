 inhibitory effect betulinic acid (BA) hepatic glucose production examined HepG2 cells high fat diet (HFD)-fed ICR mice. BA significantly inhibited hepatic glucose production (HGP) gene expression levels PGC-1alpha, PEPCK, G6Pase. BA activated AMPK suppressed expression level phosphorylated CREB. effects abolished presence compound C (an AMPK inhibitor). Moreover, inhibition AMPK overexpression dominant negative AMPK prevented BA suppression HGP, indicating inhibitory effect BA HGP AMPK-dependent. addition, BA markedly phosphorylated CAMKK, phosphorylation AMPK ACC, suppression HGP reversed presence STO-609 (a CAMKK inhibitor), suggesting CAMKK upstream kinase AMPK. animal study, HFD-fed ICR mice orally administered 5 10 mg BA per kg (B5 B10) three weeks. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, insulin resistance index B10 group decreased 34%, 59%, 38%, respectively. pyruvate tolerance test, pyruvate-induced glucose excursion decreased 27% mice pretreated 10 mg/kg BA. summary, BA effectively ameliorates hyperglycemia inhibition hepatic gluconeogenesis via modulating CAMKK-AMPK-CREB signaling pathway.
