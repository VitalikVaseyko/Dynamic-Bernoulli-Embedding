 Isoenzymes pyruvate kinase green leaves castor bean etiolated leaves pea plants separated ion filtration chromatography. One isoenzymes localized plastid, whereas cytosol. cytosolic enzyme pH optimum pH 7 pH 9, able utilize nucleotides ADP phosphoryl acceptor. plastid enzyme much sharper optimum pH 8, less efficient using alternative nucleotides. plastic pyruvate kinase, unlike cytosolic enzyme, requires presence dithiothreitol 2-mercaptoethanol isolation storage stabilize activity.
