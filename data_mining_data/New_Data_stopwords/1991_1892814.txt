 Glucose transport across plasma membrane isolated bovine rod outer segments (ROS) measured uptake 14C-labeled 3-O-methylglucose 2-deoxyglucose inferred deenergization ROS 2-deoxyglucose. Glucose transport mediated facilitated diffusion glucose transporter equilibrated external internal free hexose concentrations. Glucose transport ROS displayed two components judged kinetic analysis hexose equilibration judged inhibition cytochalasin B phloretin. Transport exchange conditions considerably faster compared net hexose uptake, similar observed erythrocyte glucose transporter. Sensitivity cytochalasin B affinity 3-O-methylglucose similar observed hepatocyte glucose transporter. cytochalasin-insensitive component appears unique ROS reflect leakage transport judged comparison L-glucose uptake. Glucose transport feeds glycolysis localized ROS. suggest major role glycolysis ROS phosphorylation GDP GTP via pyruvate kinase PEP, phosphorylation ADP ATP use creatine kinase/phosphocreatine pathway well.
