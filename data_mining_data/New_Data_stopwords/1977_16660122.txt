 light-dependent synthesis glycolate derived fructose 1,6-diphosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, glycerate 3-phosphate studied intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts absence CO(2). Glycolate yield increased elevation O(2), pH, concentration phosphorylated compound supplied. pH optimum observed pH increased 7.4 8.5. average maximal rate glycolate synthesis 50 mumoles per milligram chlorophyll per hour highest rate observed 92 2.5 mm fructose 1,6-diphosphate 100% O(2). highest yields glycolate synthesized fructose 1,6-diphosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, glycerate 3-phosphate 0.14, 0.24, 0.30, respectively, molar basis.
