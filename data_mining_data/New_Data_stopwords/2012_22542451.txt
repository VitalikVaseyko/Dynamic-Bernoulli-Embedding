 normal heart relies primarily oxidation fatty acids (FA) ATP production, whereas heart failure (HF) glucose utilization increases, implying pathological changes cardiac energy metabolism. Despite noted lipotoxic effects elevating FA, work demonstrated cardioprotective effect high fat diet (SAT) fed myocardial infarction (MI), compared normal chow (NC) fed cohorts. data suggested mechanistic link energy metabolism. goal study determine impact SAT metabolic phenotype heart MI. Male Wistar rats underwent coronary ligation surgery (MI) evaluated 8 weeks SAT. Induction MI verified echocardiography. LV function assessed vivo hemodynamic measurements revealed improvements MI-SAT group compared MI-NC. Perfused working hearts revealed decrease cardiac work MI-NC improved MI-SAT. Glucose oxidation increased FA oxidation decreased MI-NC compared shams suggesting alteration metabolic profile ameliorated SAT. (31)P NMR analysis Langendorff perfused hearts revealed differences PCr:ATP indicating overt energy deficit MI groups. Phospho-PDH PDK(4) increased MI-SAT, consistent shift towards fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Overall, results support hypothesis SAT post-infarction promotes normal metabolic phenotype may serve cardioprotective role injured heart.
