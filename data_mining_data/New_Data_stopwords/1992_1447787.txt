 structural gene pyruvate kinase Bacillus stearothermophilus cloned Escherichia coli sequenced. open reading frame ATG start codon TAG stop codon 1482 base-pairs encodes peptide relative molecular mass 52,967. expression vector pKK223-3, containing synthetic tac promoter, gene overexpressed E. coli cells estimated level 30% total soluble cell protein. purification procedure overexpressed protein established. construction characterization pair mutant proteins given insight structural basis allosteric regulation tetrameric enzyme. Substituting tryptophan tyrosine position 466 (mutant Trp466-->Tyr) resulted activated form enzyme, reduced K1/2 substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. propose characteristics mutant might result bulk removal releasing steric inhibition formation interdomain salt bridge Asp356 Arg444. regulatory behaviour double mutant produced making additional substitution aspartate glutamate position 356 (Trp466-->Tyr/Asp356-->Glu) corroborates this. position salt bridge might pivotal conformation pocket proposed open active R-conformation adopted. suggest mechanism activation B. stearothermophilus pyruvate kinase ribose-5-phosphate might hinge interaction with, indirectly through, residue Trp466, removing vicinity potential salt bridge Asp356 Arg444 thus effecting closing together protein structure concomitant opening pocket region.
