 Succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) play key roles regulation growth survival various cancers. study aimed investigate expression SDHB PDK1 recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) tissues analyzed association SDHB PDK1 expression clinical significance potential prognostic implication rNPC. Immunohistochemistry performed determine expression SDHB PDK1 tissues primary NPC (pNPC) rNPC patients. results revealed expression SDHB rNPC significantly lower pNPC, expression PDK1 higher compared pNPC. expression levels SDHB PDK1 associated stage, N stage, clinical stage, metastasis rNPC. Survival analysis showed patients low SDHB expression significantly shorter overall survival time high SDHB expression. Patients high PDK1 expression shorter survival time patients low PDK1 expression. Multivariate analysis showed expression SDHB PDK1 independent predictor survival patients rNPC. results demonstrated down-regulation SDHB up-regulation PDK1 may novel biomarkers predicting advanced tumor progression unfavorable prognosis rNPC patients.
