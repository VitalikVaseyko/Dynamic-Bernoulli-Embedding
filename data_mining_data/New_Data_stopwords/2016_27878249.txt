 Pancreatic cancer one lethal malignancies types cancer due lack early symptoms resistance conventional therapy. previous study, shown vets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog1 (ETS1) promote cell migration invasion pancreatic cancer cells. However, function ETS1 regulation glycolysis autophagy progression pancreatic cancer defined yet. study, sought identify potential role silencing ETS1 reducing expression glucose transporter1 (GLUT1) disturb glycolysis alteration 'Warburg effect', could result AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, autophagy induction reduction cell viability. MTT assay applied assess cell viability ETS1 silencing cells control groups. Glucose absorption rate, lactate production rate cellular ATP level measured standard colorimetric assay kits. levels mRNAs ETS1, GLUT1, autophagyrelated gene 5 (ATG5) ATG7 analyzed qRTPCR. expression ETS1, GLUT1, ATG5, ATG7, pAMPK, LC3II proteins evaluated western blot analysis. GraphPad Prism 5.0 used statistical analysis. found cell viability obviously attenuated silencing ETS1. Besides, results also showed expression GLUT1 significantly declined ETS1 silencing cell lines resulted lower glucose utilization lactate production. Furthermore, inhibition glycolysis, depends glucose utilization lactate production, reduced generation energy form ATP. Moreover, reduction cellular ATP associated stimulation AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) induction autophagy. results indicated ETS1 induced autophagy inhibition glycolysis, thus led comparative decrease cell viability. results implied ETS1 could potential target tumor metabolic therapy.
