 Exacerbation macrophage-mediated inflammation contributes pathogenesis various inflammatory diseases, immunometabolic programs underlying regulation macrophage activation unclear. show V-set immunoglobulin-domain-containing 4 (VSIG4), B7 family-related protein expressed resting macrophages, inhibits macrophage activation response lipopolysaccharide. Vsig4 (-/-) mice susceptible high-fat diet-caused obesity murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3)-induced fulminant hepatitis due excessive macrophage-dependent inflammation. VSIG4 activates PI3K/Akt-STAT3 pathway, leading pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 (PDK2) upregulation subsequent phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase, results reduction pyruvate/acetyl-CoA conversion, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species secretion, macrophage inhibition. Conversely, interruption Vsig4 Pdk2 promotes inflammation. Forced expression Vsig4 mice ameliorates MHV-3-induced viral fulminant hepatitis. data show VSIG4 negatively regulates macrophage activation reprogramming mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism.
