 Improvements chamber analysis directed increase sensitivity introduction fluorescence assays, facilitate handling procedure increase accuracy introduction automatic data processing partially automatized volume dispensing 50 microliter volumes simultaneously described. method used measuring enzyme activities substrate concentrations 2--30 microliter sample volumes final assay volumes lower 100 microliter. Two variants procedure presented. variant steps analysis including start reaction mixing, incubation measuring carried measuring chamber. variant II measuring chamber used measuring process only, steps performed outside special chambers. Application examples biochemical clinical chemical analysis demonstrated.
