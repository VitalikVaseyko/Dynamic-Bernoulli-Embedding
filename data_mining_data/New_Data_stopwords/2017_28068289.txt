 Discovering volatile signature cancer cells emerging approach cancer research, may contribute fast simple diagnosis tumors vivo vitro. One main contributors volatile signature hyperglycolysis, characterizes cancerous cell. metabolic perturbation cancer cells known Warburg effect; glycolysis preferred oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), even presence oxygen. precise mitochondrial alterations underlie increased dependence cancer cells aerobic glycolysis energy generation remained mystery. aimed profile volatile signature glycolysis activity lung cancer cells. vitro model, using lung cancer cell line cultures (A549, H2030, H358, H322), developed. volatile signature measured proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry normal conditions glycolysis inhibition. Glycolysis inhibition mitochondrial activity also assessed mitochondrial respiration capacity measurements. Cells divided two groups upon glycolytic profile (PET positive PET negative). Glycolysis blockade unique characteristic shared cells. Furthermore, group characteristic volatile signature enabled us discriminate sub-groups cells. conclusion, lung cancer cells may different subpopulations cells upon low high mitochondrial capacity. groups, glycolysis blockade induced unique volatile signature.
