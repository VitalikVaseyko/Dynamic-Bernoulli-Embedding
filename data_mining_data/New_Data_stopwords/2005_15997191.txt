 Alterations activities enzymes related energy metabolism canine lymphoma cells investigated. Cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PK) mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activities lymphoma cells significantly higher lymphocytes obtained lymph nodes healthy dogs, whereas cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity significantly lower lymphoma cells. cytosolic M/L ratio (MDH activity/LDH activity), considered good indicator energy metabolism related glucose utilization animal tissues, significantly higher lymphoma cells normal lymphocytes.
