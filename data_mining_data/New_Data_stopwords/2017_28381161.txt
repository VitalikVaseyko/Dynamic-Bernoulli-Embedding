 Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), serine/threonine protein kinase, known "intracellular energy sensor regulator." AMPK regulates multiple cellular processes including protein lipid synthesis, cell proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis. Moreover, AMPK plays key role regulation "Warburg effect" cancer cells. AMPK activity down-regulated tumor tissues compared corresponding adjacent paracancerous normal tissues, indicating decline AMPK activity closely associated development progression cancer. Therefore, understanding mechanism AMPK deactivation cancer progression pivotal importance may identify AMPK valid therapeutic target cancer treatment. Here, review mechanisms AMPK down-regulated cancer.
