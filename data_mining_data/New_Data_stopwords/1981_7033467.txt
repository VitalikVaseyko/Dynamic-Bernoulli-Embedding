 strain Escherichia coli mutation ana gene shown lack acetaldehyde dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase. requirement strain external oxidant grow anaerobically glucose shows reduction acetyl-CoA principal means reoxidation NADH produced glycolysis E. coli. mutants derived ana strain shown affected enzymes involved fermentation pyruvate (pyruvate formate-lyase, phosphotransacetylase, acetate kinase). gene controlling acetate kinase (ackB) activity located 39 min chromosomal map. Evidence presented anaerobic nitrite reduction pyruvate involves least dehydrogenase subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
