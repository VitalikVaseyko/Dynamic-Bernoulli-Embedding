 effects ovo feeding (IOF) creatine pyruvate (CrPyr) hatchability, growth performance energy status embryos broilers (Arbor Acres) investigated. Five treatments arranged non-injected treatment (Control), 0.6 ml physiological saline (0.75%) injected treatment (Saline), IOF treatments injected 0.6 ml physiological saline (0.75%) containing 3, 6 12 mg CrPyr (CrPyr3, CrPyr6 CrPyr12) amnion per fertile egg day 17.5 incubation. hatching, 80 male chicks treatment similar weight close average BW pooled group selected randomly assigned eight replicates 10 chicks each. results showed hatchability affected among groups, whereas hatching weight broilers CrPyr12 significantly higher control saline groups (P0.05). Irrespective dosage, concentrations creatine phosphocreatine, activities creatine kinase embryos enhanced CrPyr treatments 19 E compared control saline groups (P<0.05). activities glucose-6-phosphatase liver CrPyr6 CrPyr12 treatments higher control saline groups 19 E (P<0.05). conclusion, results indicated IOF CrPyr, especially level 12 mg/egg, could improve energy status embryos hatchlings, useful enhancing hatching weight, BW pectoral muscle weight end experiments 21 days post-hatch broilers.
