 Glucose metabolism Mycobacterium smegmatis investigated radiorespirometric method assaying key enzymes major energy-yielding pathways. Glucose oxidized organism mainly Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, irrespective carbon source used growth. pentose phosphate pathway plays minor role extent depends carbon source used growth. Enzymes glycolytic oxidative pathways detected cells grown glucose, glycerol, pyruvate enzymes Entner-Duodroff pathway could detected glucose-grown cells. Labeled acetate utilized cells cultured glucose, glycerol, pyruvate. cases C1 acetate converted CO2 incorporation cellular constituents maximum C2 acetate.
