 present analysis glycolysis based experimental findings interpretation based concepts efficiency, resonance response, control features available highly nonlinear reaction kinetics. begin model glycolytic mechanism comprehensive, includes large number known activations inhibitions enzymes metabolites, couples phosphofructokinase (PFKase) pyruvate kinase (PKase) reactions. PFKase PKase reactions coupling modeled according experimental information, attempt model glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-3-phosphoglycerate kinase reaction. use experimental data obtain best estimates kinetic parameters test model calculating concentration variations intermediate metabolites. confirm oscillatory behavior calculate ATP/ADP ratio free-energy dissipation extended range kinetic parameters function driving force glycolytic pathway, measure total adenine nucleotide concentration. find agreement calculated results experimental findings except insufficiently represented reactions. model shows average ATP/ADP ratio increased average free-energy dissipation decreased oscillatory compared steady state mode operation. average values ATP/ADP ratio free energy dissipation change abruptly past onset sustained oscillations.
