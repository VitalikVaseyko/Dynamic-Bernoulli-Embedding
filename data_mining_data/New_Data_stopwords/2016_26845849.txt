 studied effect doxorubicin HIF system pro-antioxidant balance neonatal cardiomyocytes well possibility oxidative stress correcting using curcumin. revealed expression mRNA HIF-1alpha using doxorubicin dose 0.5 muM 2.9 +/- 0.8 cu, decreased 20% compared control--3.6 +/- 0.7 cu (P < 0.05). level expression HIF target gene PDK-1 also significantly decreased (4 times). incubation doxorubicin, number live cells decreased 50.4% relative control. using doxorubicin curcumin together, percentage dead cells decreased 7,7 compared doxorubicin only. Doxorubicin intoxication led significant increase secondary products lipid peroxidation (TBARS) cardiomyocytes 3.6 times hydrogen peroxide 64%. Prolonged incubation doxorubicin reduced enzymatic activity Mn-SOD 32%, catalase activity increased 72% compared control. Adding curcumin cardiomyocyte cell culture contributed increasing Mn-SOD activity 14%, catalase--by 23%. level TBARS increased 1,4 times compared control, level H2O2 increased 20%. joint use doxorubicin curcumin resulted significant reduction free radical oxidation unlike effect doxorubicin per se. Specifically, lessening TBARS H2O2 (at 56.7 18.4% respectively), decreasing catalase hyperactivation (19%) rising Mn-SOD activity (35%).
