 Thirteen cases pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, considered heterozygous different PK mutants consanguinities parents, characterized International Committee Standardization Haematology (ICSH) recommended methods. deficiency cases named PK "Kagoshima," PK "Kyoto," PK "Takamatsu," PK "Abeno," PK "Kobe," PK "Marugame," PK "Hoenzaka," PK "Osaka," PK "Motomachi," PK "Gifu," PK "Hiroshima" PK "Matsumoto," PK "Tama." characteristics mutant PK enzymes suggest cause chronic hemolysis depends mainly decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate, thermolability, increased inhibition adenosine triphosphate, low activation fructose-1, 6-diphosphate.
