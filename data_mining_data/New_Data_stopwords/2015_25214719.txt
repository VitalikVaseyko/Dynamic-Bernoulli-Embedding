 products oxidative stress trigger chronic low-grade inflammation (pathophysiological parainflammation) process AMD patients. early AMD, soft drusen contain many mediators chronic low-grade inflammation C-reactive protein, adducts carboxyethylpyrrole protein, immunoglobulins, acute phase molecules, well complement-related proteins C3a, C5a, C5, C5b-9, CFH, CD35, CD46. complement system, mainly alternative pathway, mediates chronic autologous pathophysiological parainflammation dry exudative AMD, especially Y402H gene polymorphism, causes hypofunction/lack protective complement factor H (CFH) facilitates chronic inflammation mediated C-reactive protein (CRP). Microglial activation induces photoreceptor cells injury leads development dry AMD. Many autoantibodies (antibodies alpha beta crystallin, alpha-actinin, amyloid, C1q, chondroitin, collagen I, collagen III, collagen IV, elastin, fibronectin, heparan sulfate, histone H2A, histone H2B, hyaluronic acid, laminin, proteoglycan, vimentin, vitronectin, aldolase C pyruvate kinase M2) overexpression Fcc receptors play role immune-mediated inflammation AMD patients animal model. Macrophages infiltration retinal/choroidal interface acts protective factor early AMD (M2 phenotype macrophages); however acts proinflammatory proangiogenic factor advanced AMD (M1 M2 phenotype macrophages).
