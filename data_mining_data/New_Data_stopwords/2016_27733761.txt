 OBJECTIVE: investigate whether Cdc2-like kinase 2 (CLK2) expressed hypothalamic neurons is, whether hypothalamic CLK2 role regulation energy balance. SUBJECTS: Swiss mice chow high-fat diet (HFD) db/db mice chow diet used address role CLK2 hypothalamus. RESULTS: Hypothalamic CLK2(Thr343) phosphorylation, induces CLK2 activity, regulated vivo refeeding, insulin leptin, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-dependent manner. reduction CLK2 expression hypothalamus, chronic pharmacological inhibition TG003 chronic knockdown small interfering RNA sufficient abolish anorexigenic effect insulin leptin, increase body weight, fat mass, food intake decrease energy expenditure mice chow. contrast, CLK2(Thr343) phosphorylation hypothalamus response insulin, leptin refeeding impaired mice HFD db/db mice. Chronic CLK2 inhibition hypothalamus associated slight increase fasting blood glucose levels, reduction PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) expression liver enhanced glucose production pyruvate, suggesting regulation hepatic glucose production. Further, overexpressing CLK2 mediobasal hypothalami mice HFD db/db mice adenovirus partially reversed obese phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, results suggest protein CLK2 integrates important hypothalamic pathways, may promising molecule new therapeutic approaches obesity diabetes.
