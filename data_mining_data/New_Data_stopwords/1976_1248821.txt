 Anti human M2 type anti human L type pyruvate kinase sera allowed us distinguish two groups pyruvate kinase man. Erythrocyte liver (L type) enzymes one hand inhibited anti L anti M2 serum; pyruvate kinase tissues hand inhibited anti M2 anti L serum. latter group represent type pyruvate kinase isozymes. type isozymes studied electrofocusing thin layer acrylamide-ampholine gel. adult tissues 4 types isozymes found, designated, acid alkaline pH, M2 (predominant form spleen, leukocytes, lung...), M3, M4 M1 (predominant form muscle brain). foetal tissues extra band M2, called M2f, anodic M2, added previously described isozymes. Except brain (in isozymes M2, M3, M4 M1 found), anodic bands (M2f, M2 M3) predominant foetal tissues. isozymes M2f M2 seem therefore original type pyruvate kinase forms isozymes issue. rate isozyme seems depend tissue factors characterizing state differentiation tissues, indicated ability adult muscle extracts change isozymes M2 M3 cathodic forms.
