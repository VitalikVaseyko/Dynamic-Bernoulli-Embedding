 control pyruvate dehydrogenase activity inactivation activation studied intact mitochondria isolated rabbit heart. Pyruvate dehydrogenase could completely inactivated incubating mitochondria ATP, oligomycin, NaF. loss dehydrogenase activity correlated incorporation 32P [gamma-32P]ATP mitochondrial protein(s) decrease mitochondrial oxidation pyruvate. ATP may supplied exogenously, generated endogenous ADP oxidative phosphorylation, formed exogenous ADP carbonyl cyanid p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-uncoupled mitochondria. coupled mitochondria concentration added ATP required half-inactivate dehydrogenase 0.24 mM. uncoupled mitochondria apparent Km decreased 60 muM ATP. Inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase exogenous ATP sensitive atractyloside, suggesting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase acts internally atractyloside-sensitive barrier. divalent cation ionophore, A23187, enhanced loss dehydrogenase activity. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity regulated additionally pyruvate, inorganic phosphate, ADP. Pyruvate, presence rotenone, strongly inhibited inactivation. suggests pyruvate facilitates oxidation increases pyruvate dehydrogenase activity substrate may provide modulating influence utilization pyruvate via tricarboxylate cycle. Inorganic phosphate protected dehydrogenase inactivation ATP. ADP added incubation mixture together ATP inhibited inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase. protection may result direct action pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, ADP competes ATP, indirect action, ADP competes ATP translocase. suggested intramitochondrial [ATP]:[ADP] ratio effects kinase activity directly, whereas cytosolic [ATP]:[ADP] ratio acts indirectly. Mg2+ enhances rate reactivation inactivated pyruvate dehydrogenase presumably accelerating rate dephosphorylation enzyme. Maximal activation obtained addition 0.5 mM Mg2+..
