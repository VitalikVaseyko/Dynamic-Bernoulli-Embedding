 activating ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated DNA Damage Response (DDR), AMPK agonist metformin might sensitize cells damage, thus mimicking precancerous stimulus induces intrinsic barrier carcinogenesis. Herein, present new hypothesis metformin might function tissue sweeper pre-malignant cells gain stem cell/tumor initiating properties. enhanced glycolysis (the Warburg effect) plays causal role gain stem-like properties tumor-initiating cells protecting pro-senescent effects mitochondrial respiration-induced oxidative stress, metformin's ability disrupt glycolytic metabotype may generate cellular phenotype metabolically protected immortalization. bioenergetic crisis imposed metformin, may involve enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis oxidative stress, lower threshold cellular senescence pre-activating ATM-dependent pseudo-DDR. allows accelerated onset cellular senescence response additional oncogenic stresses. pushing cancer cells use oxidative phosphorylation instead glycolysis, metformin rescue cell surface major histocompatibility complex class (MHC-I) expression downregulated oncogenic transformation, crucial adaptation tumor cells avoid adaptive immune response cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Aside restoration tumor immunosurveillance cell-autonomous level, metformin activate senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) reinforce senescence growth arrest, might trigger immune-mediated clearance senescent cells non-cell-autonomous manner. diminishing probability escape senescence anti-tumor barrier, net effect metformin significant decrease accumulation dysfunctional, pre-malignant cells tissues, including ability initiate tumors. life-long late-life removal senescent cells shown prevent delay onset progression age-related disorders, tissue sweeper function metformin may inhibit malignant/metastatic progression pre-malignant/senescent tumor cells increase human lifespan.
