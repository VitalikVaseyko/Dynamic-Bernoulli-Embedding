 study roles invariant Asn-247, Asp-282, Gly-284, Gly-286 Gly-319 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase investigated site-directed mutagenesis. Recombinant kinases, wild-type, Asn-247Ala, Asp-282Ala, Gly-284Ala, Gly-286Ala Gly-319Ala, expressed bacteria, purified, characterized. Three mutant kinases, Asn-247Ala, Asp-282Ala Gly-286Ala, lacked appreciable activity. Two mutants, Gly-284Ala Gly-319Ala, catalytically active, apparent V(max) values close wild-type kinase (67 85 versus 70 nmol/min per mg, respectively). apparent K(m) value Gly-319Ala nucleotide substrate increased significantly (1500 versus 16 microM). contrast, Gly-284Ala slightly higher K(m) value wild-type enzyme (28 versus 16 microM). ATP-binding analysis showed Asn-247Ala, Asp-282Ala Gly-286Ala could bind nucleotide. K(d) value Gly-284Ala slightly higher wild-type enzyme (7 versus 4 microM, respectively). agreement kinetic analysis, Gly-319Ala mutant bound ATP poorly difficult determine binding constant. Despite fact Asn-247Ala, Asp-282Ala Gly-286Ala lacked enzymic activity, still capable binding protein substrate, shown negative-dominant effect competition assay wild-type kinase. results CD spectropolarimetry indicated major changes secondary structures Asp-282Ala Gly-286Ala. results suggest strongly catalytic domain pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase located C-terminus. Furthermore, catalytic domain likely folded similarly catalytic domains members ATPase/kinase superfamily [molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), DNA gyrase B histidine protein kinases].
