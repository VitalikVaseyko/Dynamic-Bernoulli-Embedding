 1956, Otto Warburg proposed origin cancer cells closely linked permanent respiratory defect bypassed Pasteur effect (i.e., inhibition anaerobic fermentation oxygen). Since then, permanent defects oxygen consumption could explain dependence cancer cells aerobic glycolysis identified. Here, show normoxic conditions exposure leukemia cells bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) promotes accumulation lactate culture medium reduces mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsiM) cell types. Notably, consumption glucose altered cocultures, suggesting accumulation lactate result reduced pyruvate metabolism. Interestingly, decrease DeltaPsiM mediated mitochondrial uncoupling leukemia cells accompanied increased expression uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). HL60 cells fail increase UCP2 expression, uncoupled coculture, exhibit increased aerobic glycolysis, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated suppression UCP2 OCI-AML3 cells reversed mitochondrial uncoupling aerobic glycolysis elicited MSC. Taken together, data suggest microenvironment activation highly conserved mammalian UCPs may facilitate Warburg effect absence permanent respiratory impairment.
