 Proteins 14-3-3 Rho-GTPase families functionally conserved eukaryotic proteins participate many important cellular processes signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, malignant transformation, stress response, apoptosis. However, exact role(s) proteins processes entirely understood. Using fungal maize pathogen, Ustilago maydis, able demonstrate functional connection Pdc1 Rho1, U. maydis homologues 14-3-3epsilon Rho1, respectively. experiments suggest Pdc1 regulates viability, cytokinesis, chromosome condensation, vacuole formation. Similarly, U. maydis Rho1 also involved three essential processes exerts additional function mating filamentation. Intriguingly, yeast two-hybrid epistasis experiments suggest Pdc1 Rho1 could constituents regulatory cascade(s) controlling cell growth filamentation U. maydis. Overexpression rho1 ameliorated defects cells depleted Pdc1. Furthermore, found another small G protein, Rac1, suppressor lethality Pdc1 Rho1. addition, deletion cla4, encoding Rac1 effector kinase, could also rescue cells Pdc1 depleted. Inferring data, propose model Rho1 Pdc1 functions U. maydis.
