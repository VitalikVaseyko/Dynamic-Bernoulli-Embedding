 network model determination tumor metabolic fluxes (13)C NMR kinetic isotopomer data developed validated perfused human DB-1 melanoma cells carrying BRAF V600E mutation, promotes oxidative metabolism. model generated bonded cumomer formalism describes key pathways tumor intermediary metabolism yields dynamic curves positional isotopic enrichment spin-spin multiplets. Cells attached microcarrier beads perfused 26 mm [1,6-(13)C2]glucose normoxic conditions 37 degrees C monitored (13)C NMR spectroscopy. Excellent agreement model-predicted experimentally measured values rates oxygen glucose consumption, lactate production, glutamate pool size validated model. ATP production glycolytic oxidative metabolism compared hyperglycemic normoxic conditions; 51% energy came oxidative phosphorylation 49% came glycolysis. Even though rate glutamine uptake approximately 50% tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, rate ATP production glutamine essentially zero (no glutaminolysis). De novo fatty acid production approximately 6% tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux 3.6% glycolysis, three non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway exchange fluxes calculated. Mass spectrometry used compare fluxes various pathways hyperglycemic (26 mm) euglycemic (5 mm) conditions. euglycemic conditions glutamine uptake doubled, ATP production glutamine significantly change. new parameter measuring Warburg effect (the ratio lactate production flux pyruvate influx mitochondrial pyruvate carrier) calculated 21, close upper limit oxidative metabolism.
