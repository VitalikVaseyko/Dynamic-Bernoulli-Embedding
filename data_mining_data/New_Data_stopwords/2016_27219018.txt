 Cancer cells adapt cellular metabolism cope high proliferation rate. Instead primarily using oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), cancer cells use less efficient glycolysis production ATP building blocks (Warburg effect). However, tumours uniform, rather functionally heterogeneous harbour subset cancer cells stemness features. cancer cells ability repopulate entire tumour thus termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) tumour-initiating cells (TICs). opposed differentiated bulk tumour cells relying glycolysis, CSCs show distinct metabolic phenotype that, depending cancer type, highly glycolytic OXPHOS dependent. either case, mitochondrial function critical takes centre stage CSC functionality. Remaining controversies young emerging research field may related CSC isolation techniques and/or use less suitable model systems. Still, apparent dependence CSCs mitochondrial function, regardless primary metabolic phenotype, represents previously unrecognised Achilles heel amendable therapeutic intervention. Elimination highly chemoresistant CSCs root many cancers via inhibition mitochondrial function bears potential prevent relapse disease thus improve patients' long-term outcome.
