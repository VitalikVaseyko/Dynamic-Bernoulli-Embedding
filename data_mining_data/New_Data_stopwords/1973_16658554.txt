 number plant species examined presence pyruvate kinase (pyruvate-ATP phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40), phosphatase activity hydrolyzes phosphoenolpyruvate. examined, cotton (Gossypium sp. L.) seeds found sufficiently free phosphatase permit kinetic study pyruvate kinase.During germination cotton seeds, pyruvate kinase activity rises first 3 days, falls back original level. developmental pattern characteristic enzymes involved conversion fat carbohydrate fatstoring seeds. phosphatase also rose rapidly germination, precluded use extracts seedlings study pyruvate kinase. evidence found presence one pyruvate kinase cotton seedlings.In crude extracts ungerminated seeds, enzyme shows slight deviations normal kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate, magnesium, lesser extent, ADP. partial purification enzyme ion exchange chromatography, enzyme shows normal kinetics. enzyme activated AMP, inhibited ATP citrate, crude partially purified preparations. suggested cotton seed pyruvate kinase regulatory enzyme.
