 activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) regulated covalent modification E1 component, catalyzed specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) phosphatases. liver, PDK2 PDK4 abundant PDK isoforms, responsible inactivation PDC glucose availability scarce body. present study, regulatory mechanisms hepatic PDC examined onset type 2 diabetes mellitus Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, using Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats controls. Plasma glucose insulin concentrations normal levels rats aged 8 weeks, significantly higher OLETF LETO rats aged 25 weeks, indicating insulin resistance OLETF rats. Plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) 1.6-fold concentrated, liver PDC activity significantly lower OLETF LETO rats ages, suggesting suppression pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation OLETF rats onset diabetes. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity abundance PDK2 PDK4 proteins, well mRNAs, greater OLETF rats ages. results suggest persistently elevated levels circulating free fatty acid normal diabetic OLETF rats play important role stimulating PDK2 PDK4 expression liver.
