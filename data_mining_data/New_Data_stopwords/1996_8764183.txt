 Fasting inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion. investigated role glucose fatty acid cycle inhibition molecular basis pancreatic islets 48-h fasted rats. fasting-impaired insulin response 27 mM glucose restored 41% carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor, etomoxir. Etomoxir also restored (by 50%) impaired glucose oxidation islets fasted rats increased ratio oxidation glycolytic flux 33 43%. Fasting decreased total pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity (active, unphosphorylated plus inactive, phosphorylated form) 29%, well percentage active form (54 +/- 5 vs. 79 +/- 2% fed rats, P < 0.001). Fasting increased islet PDH kinase activity follows: PDH-bound activity 36% free (not PDH bound) PDH kinase 70%. Fasting failed affect PDH kinase content assayed enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay antibodies raised 45 kDa PDH kinase alpha-chain. conclude fasting impairs B cell function major extent operation glucose fatty acid cycle decreased PDH activity resulting increased specific activity PDH kinase constitutes important molecular mechanism.
