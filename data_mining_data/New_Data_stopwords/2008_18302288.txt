 UNLABELLED: Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (mFAO) considered essential driving gluconeogenesis (GNG) fasting. However, quantitative vivo data de novo synthesis glucose-6-phosphate upon acute inhibition mFAO lacking. assessed hepatic glucose metabolism vivo acute inhibition mFAO 30 mg kg(-1) 2-tetradecylglycidic acid (TDGA) hypoketotic hypoglycemic male C57BL/6J mice infusion [U-(13)C]glucose, [2-(13)C]glycerol, [1-(2)H]galactose, paracetamol 6 hours, followed mass isotopomer distribution analysis blood glucose urinary paracetamol-glucuronide. TDGA treatment, endogenous glucose production unaffected (127 +/- 10 versus 118 +/- 7 micromol kg(-1) minute(-1), control versus TDGA, significant), metabolic clearance rate glucose significantly enhanced (15.9 +/- 0.9 versus 26.3 +/- 1.1 mL kg(-1) minute(-1), control versus TDGA,P < 0.05). comparison control mice, de novo synthesis glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) slightly decreased TDGA-treated mice (108 +/- 19 versus 85 +/- 6 micromol kg(-1) minute(-1), control versus TDGA, P < 0.05). Recycling glucose decreased upon TDGA treatment (26 +/- 14 versus 12 +/- 4 micromol kg(-1) minute(-1), control versus TDGA, P < 0.05). Hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) levels genes encoding enzymes involved de novo G6P synthesis unaltered, whereas glucose-6-phosphate hydrolase mRNA expressions increased TDGA-treated mice. Glucokinase pyruvate kinase mRNA levels significantly decreased, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 expression increased 30-fold; suggested decreased glycolytic activity. CONCLUSION: Acute pharmacological inhibition mFAO using TDGA effect endogenous glucose production marginal effect de novo G6P synthesis. Hence, fully active mFAO essential maintenance hepatic GNG vivo fasted mice.
