 lack cytoskeletal protein dystrophin causes muscle fiber necrosis Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) murine X-linked muscular dystrophy (MDX). However, overt disease symptoms observed dystrophin-less cultured myotubes, biological function dystrophin normal muscle cells still unknown. work, extended studies model system, using hypoosmotic shock determine stress resistance muscle cells. frozen sections control human mouse myotubes, dystrophin shown localized cell periphery mature muscle fibers. Dystrophin-less DMD MDX myotubes susceptible hypoosmotic shock controls, monitored uptake external horseradish peroxidase release soluble enzymes creatinine kinase pyruvate kinase radiolabelled proteins. Control experiments indicated difference due differences metabolism ion fluxes. Treatment cytochalasin drastically increased shock sensitivity myotubes abolished difference dystrophin-less control cells. results lend support suggested stabilizing role dystrophin context membrane-cytoskeletal complex.
