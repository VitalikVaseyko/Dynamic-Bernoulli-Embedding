 present study investigates transduction pathway mediated cadmium isolated digestive gland cells mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. effects cadmium treatment key glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (PK), Na(+)/H(+) exchanger activity examined. Cadmium (50 micro mol l(-1)) caused significant elevation intracellular pH (pHi) rise (176%) Na influx relative control values. amiloride analogue, EIPA (20 nmol l(-1)), Na(+)/H(+) exchanger blocker, together cadmium, significantly reduced effect treatment cadmium alone Na(+) influx pHi. addition, PK activity significantly increased treatment cadmium. PK activity inhibited treatment cells amiloride EIPA together cadmium. Moreover, phorbol-ester (PMA), potent activator protein kinase C (PKC), caused significant rise pHi PK activity, staurosporine calphostin C reversed events. Adrenaline, isoprenaline phenylephrine alone together cadmium also significantly increased pHi PK activity isolated digestive gland cells. latter effectors combination cadmium showed synergistic effect pHi PK. responses seem blocked propranolol, metoprolol prazosin. findings suggest hormone-like effect cadmium digestive gland cells. signal transduction pathway induced cadmium involves stimulation PK, PKC Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isolated digestive gland cells Mytilus galloprovincialis.
