 Trigonella foenum graecum (fenugreek) seed powder suggested potential antidiabetic effects. effect oral administration Trigonella whole seed powder (5% diet) 21 days glycolytic, gluconeogenic NADP-linked lipogenic enzymes studied liver kidney tissues alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Diabetic rats characterised 4-fold higher blood glucose level 0.7-fold lower body weight compared normal controls. activities glycolytic enzymes significantly lower diabetic liver higher diabetic kidney. activities gluconeogenic enzymes higher liver kidney diabetes, however activities lipogenic enzymes decreased tissues diabetes. Trigonella seed powder treatment diabetic rats 21 days brought elevated fasting blood glucose levels control levels. altered enzyme activities significantly restored control values liver kidney Trigonella seed powder treatment. therapeutic role Trigonella seed powder type-1 diabetes exemplified study attributed change glucose lipid metabolising enzyme activities normal values, thus stabilizing glucose homeostasis liver kidney. biochemical effects exerted Trigonella seeds make possible new therapeutic type-1 diabetes.
