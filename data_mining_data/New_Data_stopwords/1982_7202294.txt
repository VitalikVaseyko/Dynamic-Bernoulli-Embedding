 effects methotrexate, actinomycin-D cyclophosphamid oxygen consumption, aerobic CO2-production anaerobic glycolysis human placentas early pregnancy studied Warburg apparatus. mentioned cytostatic agents inhibited oxygen consumption. Aerobic CO2-production increased methotrexate inhibited actinomycin-D cyclophosphamide, blocking effect latter transitional. Anaerobic glycolysis decreased continuously actinomycin-D cyclophosphamide, methotrexate decreasing effect short time.
