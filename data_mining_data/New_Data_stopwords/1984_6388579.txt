 addition glucagon hepatocytes primary culture produced rapid sustained increase Km (1.27 mM phosphoenol pyruvate) pyruvate kinase. low Km (0.4 mM) form enzyme seen cells retreated insulin, demonstrating short-term regulation mechanism. Injections insulin, glucagon glucagon followed insulin demonstrated similar mechanism occurs vivo. Results longer times injection indicated another mechanism occurs altered activity result changes V max Km. Thus, dual mechanism regulation pyruvate kinase occurs. rapid responding system functions modification enzyme, long-term system functions altering rate synthesis, thus changing amount enzyme present.
