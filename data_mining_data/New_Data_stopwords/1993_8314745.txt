 functional role different sites binding transcriptional factors tissue-specific, glucose-responsive promoter L type pyruvate kinase gene (L-PK) investigated transgenic mice. sites able bind, 3' 5', HNF1, NF1, HNF4, MLTF/USF, respectively. compared level chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter transgene expression driven L-PK promoter fragment either -96 base pairs (bp) (containing HNF1 binding site) -150 bp (lacking MLTF/USF binding site) driven -183-bp L-PK promoter fragment without NF1 binding site. results demonstrate that: 1) HNF1 alone sufficient promote efficient L-PK gene transcription vivo; 2) binding sites HNF1, NF1, HNF4, though tissue-specific pattern expression respected, level gene transcription low hormonal control lost; 3) MLTF/USF binding site target hormonal control, required positive response carbohydrates negative response glucagon; 4) role NF1 promoter activity could negatively modulate L-PK gene expression different tissues, without interfering glucose hormone responsiveness.
