 continuous direct spectrophotometric assay deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase developed, based absorption 260 nm characteristic dihydrothiazine moiety cephalosporins. Km values 0.18 mM penicillin N 0.16 mM alpha-ketoglutarate determined. coupled assay using succinate thiokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase showed succinate product deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase hydroxylase reactions. expandase reaction exhibited 1:1.06 stoichiometry deacetoxycephalosporin C succinate.
