 Glucagon L-epinephrine stimulate gluconeogenesis 20 mM L-lactate, effect 3 times greater liver cells fed rats fasted rats. rate pyruvate kinase flux estimated less 10% rate gluconeogenesis lactate hepatocytes fasted rats, neither glucagon epinephrine lowered absolute rate significantly. hepatocytes fed rats, however, rate pyruvate kinase nearly one-half gluconeogenesis. Glucagon caused marked depression pyruvate kinase flux, 1 muM glucagon lowering rate nearly level found cells fasted rats Epinephrine concentrations 10(-8) 10(-6) actually increased pyruvate kinase flux gluconeogenesis lactate cells fed rats. results accord view effects glucagon epinephrine gluconeogenesis identical.
