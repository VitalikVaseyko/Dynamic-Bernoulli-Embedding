 Genetic selection commonly used farm animals manage body fat content. rainbow trout, divergent selection low high muscle fat content leads differences utilization dietary energy sources fat muscle line (FL) lean muscle line (LL). establish whether genetic selection muscle fat content affects hepatic insulin/nutrient signaling pathway, analyzed pathway expression several metabolism-related target genes livers two divergent lines fasting refeeding conditions. Whereas glycemia returned basal level 24 h refeeding FL trout, remained elevated trout. Target rapamycin (TOR) protein abundant livers FL trout trout, refeeding activation hepatic TOR signaling pathway (TOR, S6K1, S6) therefore enhanced. Genes related glycolysis (glucokinase pyruvate kinase) gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) slightly affected refeeding genetic selection. Refeeding stimulated expression lipogenic genes sterol-responsive element binding protein (SREBP1), expression fatty acid synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, serine dehydratase predominant livers FL fish compared fish. agreement recent findings linking TOR lipogenesis control, concluded genetic selection muscle fat content resulted overactivation TOR signaling pathway-associated lipogenesis probably also improved utilization glucose.
