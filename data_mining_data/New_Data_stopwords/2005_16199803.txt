 Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), key enzyme fatty acid mobilization adipocytes, demonstrated also skeletal muscle. gain insight role importance HSL skeletal muscle, transcriptome analysis soleus muscle HSL-null mice performed. total 161 transcripts found differentially expressed. Increased mRNA levels fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, phosphorylase kinase gamma1A suggest higher glycogen flux soleus muscle HSL-null mice. observed increase utilization glycogen stores supports finding. Moreover, increased amount intramyocellular lipid droplets, observed transmission electron microscopy, suggests decreased mobilization lipid stores HSL-null mice. complement transcriptome data, protein expression analysis performed. Five spots found differentially expressed: pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha, creatine kinase (CK), ankyrin-repeat domain 2, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, one protein yet identified. increased protein level CK indicates creatine phosphate degradation increased importance HSL-null mice. results study suggest absence HSL, metabolic switch reliance lipid carbohydrate energy substrates takes place, supporting important role HSL soleus muscle lipid metabolism.
