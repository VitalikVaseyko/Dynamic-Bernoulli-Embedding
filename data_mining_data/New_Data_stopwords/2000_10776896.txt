 Quantifying contribution various skeletal muscle fiber types toward lactate disposal proven elusive. part, attributed lack adequate preparations study potential metabolic pathways involved. Toward end laboratory developed several perfused muscle preparations homogeneous specific fiber types. paper briefly reviews findings regarding influence fiber type lactate disposal resting skeletal muscle metabolic pathways involved. Perfusing range lactate concentrations, 1-12 mM, fiber types shown switch net production low lactate concentrations net consumption higher concentrations. transition occurred lower lactate concentrations Type IIa fibers, compared IIb fibers. Type IIa fibers oxidation observed primary route disposal accounting approximately 50% lactate removed. fiber types, transamination significant pathway disposal lactate carbon, whereas glyconeogenesis primary pathway disposal Type IIb fibers. glyconeogenic capacity quantitatively similar Type IIa IIb fibers negligible Type fibers. pathway glyconeogenesis skeletal muscle shown substantially different employed hepatic glyconeogenesis. Results indicated neither TCA cycle phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase involved skeletal muscle glyconeogenesis. findings suggested PEP formation skeletal muscle glyconeogenesis occurs "reversal" pyruvate kinase reaction.
