 BACKGROUND: aim study explore mechanism amentoflavone (AME) improves insulin resistance human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2). METHODS: model insulin resistant cells established HepG2 treatment high glucose insulin. glucose oxidase method used detect glucose consumption group. determine mechanism AME improves insulin resistance HepG2 cells, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) western blotting used detect expression phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, pAkt; activity enzymes involved glucose metabolism; levels inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: Insulin resistance successfully induced HepG2 cells. treatment AME, glucose consumption increased significantly HepG2 cells compared model group (MG). expression PI3K, Akt, pAkt activity 6-phosphofructokinas (PFK-1), glucokinase (GCK), pyruvate kinase (PK) increased, activity glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) well levels interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), C reactive protein (CRP) decreased. CONCLUSIONS: mechanism treatment AME improves insulin resistance HepG2 cells may involve PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, processes glucose oxygenolysis, glycogen synthesis, gluconeogenesis inflammatory cytokine expression.
