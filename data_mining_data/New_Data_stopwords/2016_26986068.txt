 Alteration cellular energy metabolism principal feature tumors. important role modifying cancer cell metabolism belongs cancer-associated fibroblasts. However, regulation interaction poorly studied date. study monitored metabolic status cell types using optical redox ratio fluorescence lifetimes metabolic co-factors NAD(P)H FAD, addition intracellular pH hydrogen peroxide levels cancer cells, using genetically encoded sensors. co-culture human cervical carcinoma cells HeLa human fibroblasts observed metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis cancer cells, glycolysis toward OXPHOS fibroblasts, starting Day 2 co-culturing. metabolic switch accompanied hydrogen peroxide production slight acidification cytosol cancer cells comparison corresponding monoculture. Therefore, HeLa-huFb system demonstrated metabolic behavior similar Warburg type tumors. knowledge, first time 3 parameters investigated together model tumor-stroma co-evolution. propose determination start-point metabolic alterations understanding mechanisms realization open new ways cancer treatment.
