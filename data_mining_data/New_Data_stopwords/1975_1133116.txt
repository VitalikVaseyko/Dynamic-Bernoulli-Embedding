 structural functional properties ribosomes polysomes helix aggregates Entamoeba invadens compared sucrose gradient analysis assays vitro protein synthesis. Actively growing trophozoites, lacking helices, presented normal polysome profiles sucrose gradients. single large ribosomal helix aggregate (chromoatoid body) cysts diappeared cells disrupted. Gradient profiles cyst extracts contained predominantly large small ribosome subunit peaks evidence remaining helix fragments mRNA-bound polysomes. Sequential profiles trophozoites incubated NaF cycloheximide (which stimulate ribosome aggregation, different rates) showed polysome breakdown occurred aggregates appeared and, again, helices broke subunits vitro. Radioactive ribosomes synthesized vegetative growth collected helices encystation. Subunits ribosomes cosedimented comparable particles isolated trophozoites. Ribosomes trophozoites cysts active cell-free protein synthesis, although activity cyst extracts required addition trophozoite-soluble fraction. concluded ribosomes polysomes helices E. invadens probably identical ability form helices intrinsic property mature mRNA-free ribosomes organism.
