 Chinese pollination-constant non-astringent (C-PCNA) persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) considered important germplasm resource breeding PCNA cultivars, though molecular mechanisms astringency removal remain elucidated. Previously, showed abundance pyruvate kinase gene transcripts increased rapidly astringency removal C-PCNA persimmon fruit. Here, report full-length coding sequences six novel DkPK genes C-PCNA persimmon fruit isolated based complementary DNA (cDNA) library transcriptome data. expression patterns six DkPK genes correlations soluble proanthocyanidin (PA) content analyzed various fruit development stages different types persimmon, DkPK1 showing expression pattern last stage C-PCNA persimmon positively correlated decrease soluble PAs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed DkPK1 belongs cytosolic-1 subgroup, subcellular localization analysis confirmed DkPK1 located cytosol. Notably, tissue expression profiling revealed ubiquitous DkPK1 expression different persimmon organs, highest expression seeds. Furthermore, transient over-expression DkPK1 persimmon leaves resulted significant decrease content soluble PAs significant increase transcript levels pyruvate decarboxylase genes (DkPDC1, -3, -4, -5), catalyze conversion pyruvate acetaldehyde. Thus, propose acetaldehyde-based coagulation effect reduces content soluble PAs. Taken together, results suggest DkPK1 might involved natural removal astringency last developmental stage C-PCNA persimmon. first report identify several novel full-length DkPK genes well potential roles natural loss astringency C-PCNA persimmon.
