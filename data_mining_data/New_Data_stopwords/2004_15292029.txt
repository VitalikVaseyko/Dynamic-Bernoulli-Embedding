 Cardiac skeletal muscle respond elevated fatty acid availability increasing fatty acid oxidation, effect mediated large part peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha). hypothesized cardiac skeletal muscle alter responsiveness fatty acids course day, allowing optimal adaptation availability substrate increases. current study, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (pdk4) utilized representative PPAR alpha-regulated gene. Opposing diurnal variations pdk4 expression observed cardiac skeletal muscle isolated ad libitum-fed rat; pdk4 expression peaked middle dark light phases, respectively. Elevation circulating fatty acid levels high-fat feeding, fasting, streptozotocin-induced diabetes increased pdk4 expression heart soleus muscle. Highest levels induction observed dark phase, regardless muscle type intervention. Specific activation PPAR alpha WY-14643 rapidly induced pdk4 expression heart soleus muscle. Highest levels induction observed dark phase. pattern induction observed PPAR alpha-regulated genes malonyl-CoA decarboxylase uncoupling protein 3. Investigation potential mechanism(s) observations exposed coordinated upregulation transcriptional activators PPAR alpha system night, concomitant downregulation transcriptional repressors muscle types. conclusion, responsiveness cardiac skeletal muscle fatty acids exhibits marked diurnal variation. observations important physiological pathophysiological implications, ranging experimental design pharmacological treatment patients.
