 Changes respiration aging carrot slices correlated characteristic sequence activation irreversible reactions glycolytic pathway. induced "wound" respiration increases two stages; appear correspond period active synthesis, ADP, produced cytoplasm synthetic reactions, activates pyruvate kinase, period readjustment ATP, longer reacting synthetic reactions, activates phosphofructokinase. Although ATP cited frequently negative effector phosphofructokinase, unless concentration ATP site phosphofructokinase 50-fold higher concentration expressed per unit fresh weight tissue, cannot act way carrot slices. activation oxidative pentose phosphate pathway observed ap Rees Beevers restricted first stage induced respiration.
