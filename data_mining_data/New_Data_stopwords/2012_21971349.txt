 Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI), (1)H (13)C High-Resolution-Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) Spectroscopy, genomic approaches used compare cerebral activation neuronal glial oxidative metabolism ad libitum fed C57BL6/J leptin-deficient, genetically obese ob/ob mice. T(1)-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images across hypothalamic Arcuate Ventromedial nuclei acquired kinetically manganese infusion. Neuroglial compartmentation investigated hypothalamic biopsies intraperitoneal injections [1-(13)C]glucose [2-(13)C]acetate. Total RNA extracted determine effects leptin deficiency expression representative genes coding regulatory enzymes hypothalamic energy pathways glutamatergic neurotransmission. Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed enhanced cerebral activation hypothalamic Arcuate Ventromedial nuclei ob/ob mice. (13)C HR-MAS analysis showed increased (13)C accumulation hypothalamic glutamate glutamine carbons ob/ob mice administration [1-(13)C]glucose, primarily neuronal substrate. Hypothalamic expression genes coding glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthase significantly altered pyruvate kinase expression slightly upregulated. conclusion, leptin deficiency associated obesity led increased cerebral activation hypothalamic Arcuate Ventromedial nuclei, concomitant significant increases neuronal oxidative metabolism glutamatergic neurotransmission.
