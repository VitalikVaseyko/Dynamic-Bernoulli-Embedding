 Vasopressin stimulates lactate production hepatocytes fed rats, effect attributed exclusively Ca2+ activation glycogenolysis. provide evidence two actions vasopressin affect lactate formation rat hepatocytes. presence 50 mM glucose, vasopressin inhibited lactate production hepatocytes. inhibition relieved presence alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (alpha-CHC), blocks mitochondrial pyruvate transport. suggests vasopressin stimulates pyruvate utilization presence high concentration glucose. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), also increases lactate formation hepatocytes, similarly decrease lactate accumulation presence high glucose, suggesting stimulation lactate pyruvate utilization hormone. cells depleted Ca2+, vasopressin also stimulated lactate formation. Although vasopressin cause apparent translocation protein kinase C cell spaces, phospholipase C treatment hepatocytes duplicate vasopressin stimulation lactate formation, provided fatty acid oxidation suppressed simultaneous presence inhibitor palmixorate. conclude three actions vasopressin affect lactate pyruvate formation: calcium-linked activations glycogenolysis mitochondrial pyruvate utilization, stimulation glycolysis likely mediated protein kinase C.
