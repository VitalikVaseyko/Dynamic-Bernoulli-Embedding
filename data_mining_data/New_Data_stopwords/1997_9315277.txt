 studied effect cyclic polylactates ranging size degree polymerization number 3 13 pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, anaerobic glycolysis, growth tumor cells survival tumor bearing mice. Pyruvate kinase lactic dehydrogenase activities inhibited cyclic polylactates, inhibition mechanism cyclic polylactates lactic dehydrogenase noncompetitive. half anaerobic glycolytic activity FM3A ascites tumor cells inhibited tumor cell growth also effectively inhibited cyclic polylactates. Mice, treated cyclic polylactates inoculation FM3A ascites tumor cells lived significantly longer mice, treated vehicle non mice.
