 activity beta isoform protein kinase C (PKC beta) reduced diabetic heart. Since isozyme implicated insulin action, tested hypothesis PKC beta contributes development impaired glucose metabolism noninsulin-dependent diabetic heart. Exposure diabetic heart buffer containing protein kinase C activator, phorbol myristate acetate, increased PKC beta activity membrane. Associated improvement PKC beta activity biphasic change glucose metabolism. initial phase characterized breakdown glycogen stores, stimulation glucose oxidation decrease endogenous fatty acid oxidation. followed second phase uptake glucose modestly stimulated. Nonetheless, since phorbol ester overcome diabetes-linked defect pyruvate dehydrogenase, increase glycolytic flux associated rise glucose oxidation. Consequently, nearly 50% triose units diverted lactate pyruvate production generation ATP glucose restricted. Since insulin promotes glucose uptake, also glycogen synthesis glucose oxidation, phorbol ester insulin effects different. Thus, data support role PKC beta development glucose metabolic defects hearts noninsulin-dependent diabetic rats.
