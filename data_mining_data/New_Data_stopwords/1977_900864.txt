 Pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme critical importance glycolytic pathway red cells, deficiency which, whether congenital acquired, results hemolytic anemia. Measurement enzyme rapid simple utilizing preprepared substrate reagents. caution must taken, however, measurement interpretation. Red cells must separated blood cells, particularly granulocytes, since PK white cells different red cells present much higher activity per cell. Sometimes use special techniques measurement [low substrate concentration (phospho-enolpyruvate, known PEP, 0.4 mM place 2 mM) heating 53 degrees C 60 minutes, (to test thermostability)] necessary detect abnormal molecular characteristics PK, particularly acquired form deficiency. Evidence recently presented suggests acquired form PK deficiency may sometimes due inhibitors oxidize sulfhydril bonds enzyme alter substrate binding properties molecular characteristics.
