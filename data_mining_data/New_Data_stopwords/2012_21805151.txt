 Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes final step glycolysis. reports role PK rice. Here, identified novel rice dwarf mutant, designated ospk1, showing dwarfism, panicle enclosure, reduced seed set, outgrowth axillary buds culm nodes. Sequence analyses 5'-RACE indicated single T-DNA inserted transcriptional regulatory region OsPK1 ospk1. Quantitative RT-PCR result showed OsPK1 expression decreased approximately 90% ospk1 compared WT. Enzyme assay transient expression protoplasts indicated OsPK1 encodes cytosolic PK (PK(c)). Complementation OsPK1 demonstrated OsPK1 responsible phenotype ospk1. Quantitative RT-PCR GUS staining analyses exhibited OsPK1 expressed mainly leaf mesophyll cells, phloem companion cells stems, cortical parenchyma cells roots. transcriptions four putative enzymes involved glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway altered ospk1. amount pyruvate decreased ospk1. propose OsPK1 plays important role affecting glycolytic pathway. contents glucose fructose markedly accumulated flag leaf blade panicle ospk1. sucrose level panicle ospk1 decreased approximately 84%. findings indicated monosaccharide metabolism sugar transport altered due decreased expression OsPK1. Together, results provide new insights role PK(c) plant morphological development, especially plant height.
