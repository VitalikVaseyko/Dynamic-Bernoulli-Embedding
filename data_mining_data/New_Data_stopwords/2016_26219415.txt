 OBJECTIVES: investigate impact transient (2-4 h) hypoxia metabolic reprogramming adipocytes. METHODS: impact transient hypoxia metabolic reprogramming investigated 3T3-L1 cells differentiation. Glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis mitochondria examined determine hypoxia effects. Preadipocytes exposed transient hypoxia (4 h day(-1)) course differentiation. Insulin sensitivity triglyceride (TG) accumulation examined cells end differentiation determine reprogramming effects. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity gene expression determined quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR western blotting search mechanism reprogramming. RESULTS: acute response hypoxia, adipocytes exhibited increase insulin-dependent -independent glucose uptake. Fatty acid beta-oxidation pyruvate dehydrogenase activity decreased. Multiple exposures differentiating adipocytes transient hypoxia enhanced insulin signaling, TG accumulation expression antioxidant genes differentiated adipocytes absence hypoxia. metabolic memory associated elevated AMPK activity gene expression (GLUT1, PGC-1alpha, PPARgamma, SREBP, NRF-1, ESRRalpha, LPL). enhanced insulin sensitivity blocked AMPK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated exposure differentiating adipocytes transient hypoxia able reprogram cells increased TG accumulation enhanced insulin sensitivity. metabolic alterations observed postdifferentiated cells normoxia. reprogramming involves AMPK activation gene expression metabolic pathways cytosol mitochondria.
