 BACKGROUND/AIMS: previously shown daily subcutaneous injections naturally occurring phytoestrogen genistein (600 mg genistein/kg body weight/day, 600G) results significantly increased basal intestinal chloride, Cl(-), secretion (Isc, measure transepithelial secretion) intact C57BL/6J female mice 1-week treatment, compared controls (DMSO vehicle injected). Removal endogenous estrogen via ovariectomy (OVX) effect 600G-mediated increase basal Isc. METHODS: Given estrogen-like characteristics genistein, compared effects daily estradiol (E2) injections (10 mg E2/kg body weight/day, 10E2) basal Isc intact OVX mice. intact mice, 10E2 without effect basal Isc, however, OVX mice, 10E2 significantly increased basal Isc (mimicked 600G). goal current study characterize intracellular signaling pathways responsible mediating 600G- 10E2-stimulated increases basal Isc intact female OVX mice. RESULTS: measured total protein expression isolated segments jejunum using western blot following six groups mice; intact OVX with; 600G, 10E2 control. proteins interest were: Akt, p-Akt, p-PDK1, p-PTEN, p-c-Raf, p-GSK-3beta, rap-1 ERK1/2. blots normalized GAPDH levels (n = 6-18/group). CONCLUSION: data suggest presence endogenous sex steroid, estrogen, modifies intracellular signaling pathway required mediate Cl(-) secretion intestine exposed exogenous 600G E2. studies may relevance designing pharmacological tools women intestinal chloride secretory dysfunctions.
