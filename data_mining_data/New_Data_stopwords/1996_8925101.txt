 Carrier rat erythrocytes loaded exogenous substances ([125I] carbonic anhydrase) hypotonic-isotonic dialysis become heterogeneous cell populations fractionated using counter-current distribution (CCD) technique. Two well-defined low- high-partition ratio, G, subpopulations obtained charge-sensitive dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase systems. low-G subpopulation, contains fragile surface-altered cells, deduced osmotic fragility curves partition behaviour, respectively, presents high amount exogenous substance incorporated (134.6 cpm/10(6) cells). high-G subpopulation, contains cells similar control isotonically dialyzed cells presents lower amount exogenous substance incorporated (69.8 cpm/10(6) cells). Cells high-G subpopulation seem fractionated, like controls, according ageing suggested decline pyruvate kinase specific activity left- right-hand side CCD profile.
