 Glycolytic enzymes found bind isolated coated vesicles. preparation rabbit muscle myogen mixed clathrin coated vesicles greater 75% four enzymes, aldolase. glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase found pellet isolated coated vesicles upon centrifugation 60.000 g 1 h. binding purified aldolase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, muscle form heart form lactate dehydrogenase characterized further. Substrates found elute three enzymes binding determined function ionic strength.
