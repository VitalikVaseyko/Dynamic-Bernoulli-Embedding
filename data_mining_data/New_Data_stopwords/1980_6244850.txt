 ATP-depleted human red cells incubated glucose-containing medium [32P]orthophosphate presence absence cyclic 3',5'-AMP dibutyril cyclic 3',5'-AMP. Spectrin, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase hemoglobin A1 purified analyzed sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein-bound radioactivity measured sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins. cytosol, intense phosphorylation found pyruvate kinase whose, presence cyclic AMP, specific radioactivity comparable membrane protein spectrin. absence cyclic nucleotides five times less phosphorylated. Phosphofructokinase phosphorylated red cells incubated cyclic nucleotides; extent phosphorylation four times less pyruvate kinase. Hemoglobin, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase contaminant protein copurified phosphofructokinase phosphorylated: 'background' radioactivity found proteins 100 times less pyruvate kinase spectrin, 20 times less phosphofructokinase (+cyclic AMP).
