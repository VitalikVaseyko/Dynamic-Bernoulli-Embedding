 Protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) homolog, POMT2, responsible catalysis first step O-mannosyl glycan synthesis. Mutations genes associated type congenital muscular dystrophy called Walker-Warburg syndrome. Arg(64), Glu(78) Arg(138) N-terminus region ScPmt1p, POMT homolog Saccharomyces cerevisiae, important transferase activity. Arg(138) also essential complex formation ScPmt2p. examined effects replacing corresponding residues human POMT1 POMT2 Ala complex formation enzymatic activity. human POMT1 mutants lost almost transferase activity POMT2 mutants retained enzymatic activity. Neither mutant lost ability form complexes native counter component. results indicate ScPmtps human POMTs different mechanisms complex formation. also suggest human POMT1 POMT2 discrete functions since effect amino acid substitutions enzymatic activity different.
