 BACKGROUND: following myocardial ischemia, glucose oxidation rates low fatty acids dominate source oxidative metabolism. metabolic phenotype associated contractile dysfunction reperfusion. determine mechanism reliance fatty acid oxidation source ATP generation, functional proteomics approach utilized. RESULTS: 2-D gel electrophoresis mitochondria working rat hearts subjected 25 minutes global flow ischemia followed 40 minutes aerobic reperfusion identified 32 changes protein abundance compared aerobic controls. five proteins greatest change abundance, two increased (long chain acyl-coenzyme dehydrogenase (48 +/- 1 versus 39 +/- 3 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 0.05) alpha subunit ATP synthase (189 +/- 15 versus 113 +/- 23 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 0.05)), two decreased (24 kDa subunit NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (94 +/- 7 versus 127 +/- 9 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 0.05) subunit ATP synthase (230 +/- 11 versus 368 +/- 47 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 05)). Two forms pyruvate dehydrogenase betaE1 subunit, rate-limiting enzyme glucose oxidation, also identified. protein level acidic form pyruvate dehydrogenase reduced reperfusion (37 +/- 4 versus 56 +/- 7 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 05), basic form remained unchanged. acidic isoform found O-palmitoylated, isoforms exhibited ischemia/reperfusion-induced phosphorylation. silico analysis identified putative kinases insulin receptor kinase basic form protein kinase Czeta protein kinase acidic form. modifications pyruvate dehydrogenase associated 35% decrease glucose oxidation reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion induces significant changes number metabolic proteins mitochondrial proteome. particular, ischemia/reperfusion induced post-translational modification pyruvate dehydrogenase, rate-limiting step glucose oxidation, associated 35% decrease glucose oxidation reperfusion. Therefore post-translational modifications may important implications regulation myocardial energy metabolism.
