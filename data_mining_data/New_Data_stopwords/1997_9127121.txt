 Defects muscle glycogen metabolism well documented causes metabolic myopathy, presenting spectrum symptoms show relationship position defective enzyme within glycolytic pathway. present three women metabolic myopathic conditions show features associated glycogen storage disease features mitochondrial defect. Muscle histochemistry electron microscopy showed minor non-specific changes. However biochemical analysis muscle biopsies three cases revealed defect glycolysis level pyruvate kinase (PK), defect yet undescribed. investigation enzyme's properties, revealed residual muscle PK activity due muscle (M1) isoform.
