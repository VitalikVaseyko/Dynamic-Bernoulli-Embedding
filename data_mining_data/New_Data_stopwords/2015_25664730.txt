 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) essential metabolic enzyme catalyzes interconversion pyruvate lactate using NADH/NAD(+) co-substrate. Many cancer cells exhibit glycolytic phenotype known Warburg effect, elevated LDH levels enhance conversion glucose lactate, making LDH attractive therapeutic target oncology. Two known inhibitors human muscle LDH isoform, LDHA, designated 1 2, selected, IC50 values determined 14.4 +/- 3.77 2.20 +/- 0.15 microM, respectively. X-ray crystal structures LDHA complex inhibitor determined; inhibitors bind site overlapping NADH-binding site. Further, apo LDHA crystal structure solved new space group reported, well complex NADH substrate analogue oxalate bound seven eight molecules oxalate bound eighth molecule asymmetric unit. latter structure, kanamycin molecule located inhibitor-binding site, thereby blocking NADH binding. structures provide insights LDHA enzyme mechanism inhibition framework structure-assisted drug design may contribute new cancer therapies.
