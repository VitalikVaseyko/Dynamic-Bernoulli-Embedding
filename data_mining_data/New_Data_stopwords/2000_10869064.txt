 metabolic consequences two insertions, iscR1::MudJ iscA2::MudJ, isc gene cluster Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium studied. insertions polar effects caused nutritional requirement thiazole moiety thiamine. Data showed IscS required synthesis nicotinic acid thiazole moiety thiamine one additional isc gene products required distinct step thiazole biosynthetic pathway. Strains isc lesions reduced succinate dehydrogenase aconitase activities. Furthermore, isc mutants accumulated increased levels pyruvate growth medium response exogenously added iron (FeCl(3)), response required functional ferric uptake regulator, Fur.
