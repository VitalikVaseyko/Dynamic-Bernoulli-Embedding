 activities pyruvate kinase (PK), pyruvate: formate-lyase (PFL), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), citrate synthase (CS) involved anaerobic glycerol conversion Klebsiella pneumoniae studied continuous culture conditions steady states sustained oscillations. vitro vivo activities PK, PFL, PDH strongly affected substrate concentration uptake rate, vitro activity CS. flux phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate found mainly regulated genetic level synthesis rate PK, particularly low substrate concentration low growth rate. contrast, conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA mainly regulated metabolic level vivo activities PFL PDH. ratio vitro vivo activities range 1 1.5 PK, 5 17 PFL 5 80 PDH experimental conditions. regulation vivo activity synthesis enzymes sensitive fluctuations culture conditions, leading oscillations vitro vivo activities. particular, PFL strongly affected oscillations; average vitro activity half corresponding steady-state value similar environmental conditions. average vitro activities PDH PK oscillations close corresponding steady-state values. contrast enzymes measured glycerol metabolism K. pneumoniae PFL PDH effectively vivo utilized oscillations steady state, underlining peculiar role pyruvate metabolism dynamic responses culture.
