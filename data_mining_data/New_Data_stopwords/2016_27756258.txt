 BACKGROUND: Solid tumors, hepato-pancreato-biliary cancer, develop tumor hypoxia tumor growth. Despite advances surgery, majority patients unresectable condition. stage standard cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens applied limited success. Novel biological treatment options based antiangiogenic mechanism action neglect hypoxia mediated mechanisms (e.g. epithelial-mesenchymal transition, Warburg effect, immunological response) leading increased invasiveness poor outcome. novel antihypoxic molecule myo-inositoltrispyrophosphate (ITPP, OXY111A) acts allosteric effector hemoglobin promotes normoxia hypoxic tumors. preclinical studies, tumor growth reduced survival prolonged. Additionally, beneficial side effect profile observed. METHODS: first Ib/IIa clinical trial assess safety tolerability OXY111A well proof concept regarding efficacy patients non-resectable primary secondary tumors liver, pancreas, biliary tract. study design exploratory, prospective, open-labelled mono-centric. study divided dose escalation part maximum 48 subjects extension part, 21 subjects included. DISCUSSION: novel antihypoxic compound OXY111A tested several cancer animal models showing beneficial effects survival low side effect profiles. first patient application OXY111A reveal potential beneficial outcomes anti-hypoxic therapy added standard cytotoxic treatment patients primary secondary hepatopancreatobiliary tumors.
