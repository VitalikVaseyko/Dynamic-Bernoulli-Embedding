 Novel classes antimicrobials needed address challenge multidrug-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Using architecture MRSA interactome, identified pyruvate kinase (PK) potential novel drug target based upon highly connected, essential hub MRSA interactome. Structural modeling, including X-ray crystallography, revealed discrete features PK MRSA, appeared suitable selective targeting bacterial enzyme. silico library screening combined functional enzymatic assays identified acyl hydrazone-based compound (IS-130) potent MRSA PK inhibitor (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] 0.1 muM) >1,000-fold selectivity human PK isoforms. Medicinal chemistry around IS-130 scaffold identified analogs potently selectively inhibited MRSA PK enzymatic activity S. aureus growth vitro (MIC 1 5 mug/ml). novel anti-PK compounds found possess antistaphylococcal activity, including MRSA multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDRSA) strains. compounds also exhibited exceptional antibacterial activities Gram-positive genera, including enterococci streptococci. PK lead compounds found noncompetitive inhibitors bactericidal. addition, mutants significant increases MICs isolated 25 bacterial passages culture, indicating resistance may slow emerge. findings validate principles network science powerful approach identify novel antibacterial drug targets. also provide proof principle, based upon PK MRSA, research platform aimed discovering optimizing selective inhibitors novel bacterial targets human orthologs exist, leads anti-infective drug development.
