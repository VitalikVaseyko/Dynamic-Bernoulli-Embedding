 Equinatoxins purified tentacles bodies sea anemone Actinia equina use acetone precipitation, well column chromatographies Sephadex G-50 CM-cellulose according modified method Macek Lebez (1988). equinatoxins obtained, equinatoxin 1 2, hemolytic glycoproteins relative molecular mass 20000. Equinatoxin 2 found rich glycine, alanine valine. amino acid sequences equinatoxins 1 2 partially determined. portion N-terminal amino acid sequence equinatoxin 2 similar pyruvate kinase sialidase.
