 Background: Cancer cells express M2 isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2). PKM2 expression required cancers, PKM2 loss promote cancer progression; however, PKM2 reported essential tumor contexts, including proposed non-metabolic role beta-catenin nuclear translocation. PKM2 expressed colon cancers loss Apc tumor suppressor results beta-catenin nuclear translocation aberrant activation canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Whether PKM2 required colon cancer context investigated. Results: Colon tumorigenesis induced mice harboring conditional Apc Pkm2 alleles, tumor progression monitored serial colonoscopy. PKM2 deletion effect overall survival, number mice developed tumors, number tumors developed per animal. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated PKM2 expression wild-type tumors expected loss PKM2 expression tumors Pkm2 conditional mice. Loss PKM2 resulted pyruvate kinase M1 expression effect nuclear beta-catenin staining. findings consistent tumor growth activated Wnt signaling despite PKM2 loss model. also found large fraction human colon cancers low undetectable levels PKM2 expression. Conclusions: PKM2 required Apc-deficient colon cancer nuclear translocation beta-catenin Apc-null tumor cells. findings suggest PKM2 expression required colon tumor formation progression.
