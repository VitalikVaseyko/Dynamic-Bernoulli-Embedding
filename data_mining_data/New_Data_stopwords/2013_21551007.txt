 study, compared effects endurance training fasted state (F) vs. fed state [ample carbohydrate intake (CHO)] exercise-induced intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) glycogen utilization 6-wk period hypercaloric ( approximately +30% kcal/day) fat-rich diet (HFD; 50% kcal). Healthy male volunteers (18-25 yrs) received HFD conjunction endurance training (four times, 60-90 min/wk) either F (n = 10) CHO exercise sessions (n = 10). control group (n = 7) received HFD without training increased body weight approximately 3 kg (P < 0.001). HFD, subjects performed 2-h constant-load bicycle exercise test F approximately 70% maximal oxygen uptake rate. HFD, absence (F) presence (CHO) training, elevated basal IMCL content approximately 50% type approximately 75% type IIa fibers (P < 0.05). Independent training F CHO, HFD, such, stimulated exercise-induced net IMCL breakdown approximately twofold type approximately fourfold type IIa fibers. Furthermore, exercise-induced net muscle glycogen breakdown significantly affected HFD. concluded HFD stimulates net IMCL degradation increasing basal IMCL content exercise type especially IIa fibers. Furthermore, hypercaloric HFD provides adequate amounts carbohydrates maintain high muscle glycogen content training impair exercise-induced muscle glycogen breakdown.
