 Rat heart branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDH kinase) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDH kinase) purified respective complexes apparent homogeneity. BCKDH kinase consisted one subunit molecular weight 44,000-45,000 Da, whereas PDH kinase consisted two subunits molecular weight 48,000 Da (alpha) 45,000 Da (beta) previously shown bovine kidney enzyme (Stepp et al., 1983, J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9454-9458). Proteolysis maps BCKDH kinase two subunits PDH kinase different, suggesting subunits different entities. alpha subunit rat heart PDH kinase could cleaved selectively chymotrypsin concomitant loss kinase activity, previously shown bovine kidney enzyme, suggesting catalytic activity PDH kinase resides alpha subunit. beta subunit appeared different entity unique PDH kinase. kinases exhibited marked substrate specificity toward respective complexes would inactivate heterologous complexes. kinases possessed slightly different substrate specificity toward histones. BCKDH kinase preferentially phosphorylated histones order f1 greater f2B much greater f2A much greater f3. relative order PDH kinase same, f2A f3 considerably better substrates BCKDH kinase. observations suggest kinases different requirements structure protein phosphorylation sites.
