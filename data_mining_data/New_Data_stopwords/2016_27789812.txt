 Cellular metabolic fluxes determined enzyme activities metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal impact specific substrates regulators enzyme kinetics capture extent metabolite enzyme concentrations vary across physiological states and, therefore, cellular reactions regulated. measured enzyme metabolite concentrations metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. assessed extent flux explained Michaelis-Menten relationship enzyme, substrate, product, potential regulator concentrations. revealed three previously unrecognized instances cross-pathway regulation, biochemically verified. One involved inhibition pyruvate kinase citrate, accumulated thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate concentrations strongest driver net rates cellular metabolic reactions, metabolite concentrations collectively double physiological impact enzymes.
