 BACKGROUND & AIMS: high-fat diet (HFD) cause serious health problems, including alteration gastrointestinal transit, exact mechanism clear. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) involved energy homeostasis, lipid metabolism, HFD-induced weight gain. investigated role miRNAs HFD-induced damage enteric nervous system. METHODS: Male mice fed HFD (60% calories fat) regular diets (18% calories fat) 11 weeks. Mice regular diets HFDs given intraperitoneal injections Mir375 inhibitor negative control. Body weights, food intake, stool indices, gastrointestinal transit (following Evans blue gavage) measured. enteric neuronal cell line (immorto-fetal enteric neuronal) primary enteric neurons used vitro studies. RESULTS: HFD delayed intestinal transit, associated increased apoptosis loss colonic myenteric neurons. Mice fed low-palmitate HFD develop similar phenotype. Palmitate caused apoptosis enteric neuronal cells associated mitochondrial dysfunction endoplasmic reticulum stress. Palmitate significantly increased expression Mir375 vitro; transfection cells Mir375 inhibitor prevented palmitate-induced enteric neuronal cell apoptosis. Mir375 expression increased myenteric ganglia mice fed HFD associated decreased levels Mir375 target messenger RNAs, including Pdk1. Systemic injection Mir375 inhibitor 5 weeks prevented HFD-induced delay intestinal transit morphologic changes. CONCLUSIONS: HFDs delay colonic transit, partly inducing apoptosis enteric neuronal cells. effect mediated Mir375 associated reduced levels Pdk1. Mir375 might targeted increase survival enteric neurons gastrointestinal motility.
