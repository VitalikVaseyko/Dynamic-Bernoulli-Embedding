 Current drug development oncology non-selective typically focuses pathways essential survival dividing cells. unique metabolic profile cancer, characterized increased glycolysis suppressed mitochondrial glucose oxidation (GO) provides cancer cells proliferative advantage, conducive apoptosis resistance even increased angiogenesis. Recent evidence suggests targeting cancer-specific metabolic mitochondrial remodeling may offer selectivity cancer treatment. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) mitochondrial enzyme activated variety cancers results selective inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase, complex enzymes converts cytosolic pyruvate mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, substrate Krebs' cycle. Inhibition PDK either small interfering RNAs orphan drug dichloroacetate (DCA) shifts metabolism cancer cells glycolysis GO reverses suppression mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. addition, therapeutic strategy increases production diffusible Krebs' cycle intermediates mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species, activating p53 inhibiting pro-proliferative pro-angiogenic transcription factors like nuclear factor activated cells hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha. effects result decreased tumor growth angiogenesis variety cancers high selectivity. small mechanistic clinical trial patients glioblastoma, highly aggressive vascular form brain cancer, DCA decreased tumor angiogenesis tumor growth, suggesting metabolic-targeting therapies translated directly patients. recently, M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), highly expressed cancer, associated suppressed mitochondrial function. Similar DCA, activation PKM2 many cancers results increased mitochondrial function decreased tumor growth. Therefore, reversing mitochondrial suppression metabolic-modulating drugs, like PDK inhibitors PKM2 activators holds promise rapidly expanding field metabolic oncology.
