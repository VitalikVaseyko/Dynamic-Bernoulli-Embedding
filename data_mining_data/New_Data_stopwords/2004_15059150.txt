 Two single-nucleotide substitutions PKLR constituted molecular basis underlying pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency patient severe haemolytic anaemia. One novel mutation, IVS5+1G>A, abolished intron 5 donor splice site. mutation, c.1436G>A, altered intron 10 donor splice site consensus sequence and, moreover, encoded R479H substitution. studied effects PKLR pre-mRNA processing, using ex vivo-produced nucleated erythroid cells patient. Abolition intron 5 splice site initiated two events majority transcripts: skipping exon 5 or, surprisingly, simultaneous skipping exon 5 6 (Delta5,6). Subcellular localization transcripts suggested functional protein produced IVS5+1A allele. unusual Delta5,6 transcript suggests efficient inclusion exon 6 wild-type PKLR mRNA depends presence splice-enhancing elements exon 5. c.1436G>A mutation caused skipping exon 10 mainly associated severe reduction transcripts although were, general, normally processed. Accordingly, low amounts PK detected nucleated erythroid cells patient, thus correlating patient's PK-deficient phenotype. Finally, several low-abundant transcripts detected represent first examples "leaky-splicing" PKLR.
