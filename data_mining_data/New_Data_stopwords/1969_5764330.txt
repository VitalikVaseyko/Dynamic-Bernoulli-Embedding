 Oxygen utilization splenic cells normal BCG-sensitized guinea pigs measured Warburg respirometer absence presence Old Tuberculin (OT). absence OT, normal sensitive cells respired rate; presence OT, normal cell respiration remained unchanged, whereas respiration sensitive cells increased significantly. enhancement oxygen utilization sensitive cells induced OT Purified Protein Derivative pronounced first hour interaction cells antigen. normal splenic cells treated extract hypersensitive cells, respiration enhanced presence OT. Oxygen utilization cells desensitized animals differ cells normal animals. absence reactivity OT splenic cells skin desensitized guinea pigs suggested phenomena expressions antigen-induced biological changes cells animals delayed hypersensitivity.
