 Hansen, Robert W. (University Illinois College Medicine, Chicago) James A. Hayashi. Glycolate metabolism Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 83:679-687. 1962.-This study glycolate-adapted Escherichia coli indicates probable route utilization substrate includes glyceric acid, 3-phosphoglyceric acid, tricarboxylic acid cycle. glyceric acid dehydrogenase, reduces tartronic semialdehyde glycerate presence reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide, kinase, catalyzes formation 3-phosphoglycerate glyceric acid adenosine triphosphate, shown present. Carbon recoveries growing cultures manometric data obtained resting cells showed complete oxidation glycolate carbon dioxide. Measurements oxidation tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates indicated compounds oxidized without lag rate commensurate rate glycolate oxidation. Assays enzymes characteristic known pathways terminal oxidation, isocitratase, malate synthetase, isocitric dehydrogenase, condensing enzyme, provided evidence operating tricarboxylic acid cycle. postulated pathway utilization glycolic acid follows: glycolate --> glycerate --> 3-phosphoglycerate --> pyruvate --> tricarboxylic acid cycle.
