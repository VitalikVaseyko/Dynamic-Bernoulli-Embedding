 Escherichia coli strains (KJ060 KJ073) previously developed succinate production modified malate production. Many unexpected changes observed investigation. initial strategy deleting fumarase isoenzymes ineffective, succinate continued accumulate. Surprisingly, mutation fumarate reductase alone sufficient redirect carbon flow malate even presence fumarase. deletions needed inactivate malic enzymes (typically gluconeogenic) prevent conversion pyruvate. However, deletion genes (sfcA maeB) resulted unexpected accumulation D-lactate despite prior deletion mgsA ldhA absence apparent lactate dehydrogenase activity. Although metabolic source D-lactate identified, lactate accumulation increased supplementation pyruvate decreased deletion either pyruvate kinase gene (pykA pykF) reduce supply pyruvate. Many gene deletions adversely affected growth cell yield minimal medium anaerobic conditions, volumetric rates malate production remained low. final strain (XZ658) produced 163 mM malate, yield 1.0 mol (mol glucose(-1)), half theoretical maximum. Using two-stage process (aerobic cell growth anaerobic malate production), engineered strain produced 253 mM malate (34 g liter(-1)) within 72 h, higher yield (1.42 mol mol(-1)) productivity (0.47 g liter(-1) h(-1)). malate yield productivity equal better known biocatalysts.
