 Proteins shuttle nucleus cytoplasm implicated transport signal transduction processes. Using assays based interspecies heterokaryons microinjection Xenopus oocytes, examined structural features determine nuclear export shuttling proteins. Three classes proteins studied: first, wild-type mutant forms nucleolin, one first shuttling proteins identified; second, artificial nuclear reporter proteins derived cytoplasmic pyruvate kinase; third, wild-type mutant lamins differing abilities incorporated lamina. results show protein require positively acting export signals transported nucleus cytoplasm; instead, shuttling ability limited primarily intranuclear interactions. conclude nucleocytoplasmic shuttling general phenomenon restricted proteins involved nucleocytoplasmic transport.
