 Eighteen unrelated pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient Indian patients identified past 4 years varied clinical phenotypes ranging mild chronic haemolytic anaemia severe transfusion-dependent disorder. identified 17 different mutations PKLR gene among 36 mutated alleles. Ten novel mutations identified: 427G>A, 499C>A, 1072G>A, 1180G>T, 1216G>A, 1220A>G, 644delG, IVS5 (+20) C>A, IVS9 (+44) C>T, IVS9 (+93) A>C. severe syndrome commonly associated mutations, 992A>G, 1436G>A, 1220A>G, 644delG IVS9 (+93) A>C, PKLR gene. Molecular graphics analysis human red blood cell PK (RPK), based crystal structure human PK, shows mutations located near substrate fructose 1,6-diphosphate binding site may change conformation active site, resulting low PK activity severe clinical symptoms. mutations target distinct regions RPK structure, including domain interfaces catalytic allosteric sites. particular, 1216G>A 1219G>A mutations significantly affect interdomain interaction located near catalytic site A/B interface domains. frequent mutations Indian population appear 1436G>A (19.44%), followed 1456C>T (16.66%) 992A>G (16.66%). first study correlate clinical profile molecular defects causing PK deficiency India 10 novel mutations produce non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia identified.
