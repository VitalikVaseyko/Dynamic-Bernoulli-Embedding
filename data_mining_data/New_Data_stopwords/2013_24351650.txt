 lymphocytes, master regulators immunity, unusual lifestyle. Equipped clonally distributed receptor remain resting long periods time go overdrive encountering antigen. Antigen recognition triggers activation program results massive proliferation, differentiation effector/memory cells, egress lymphoid storage sites, production array cytokines. adapt sudden demand energy biosynthetic macromolecules, cells resort aerobic glycolysis, relying Warburg effect provide sufficient ATP precursor molecules. Metabolic adaptation biosynthetic needs includes upregulation autophagy, catabolic process resulting degradation cytoplasmic contents. close connection metabolic switch, proliferative expansion, functional differentiation connects metabolic conditions cell normal pathogenic immunity.
