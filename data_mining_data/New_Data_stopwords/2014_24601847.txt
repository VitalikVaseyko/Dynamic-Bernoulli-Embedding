 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) one common enzymatic defects humans autosomal recessive disorder causing chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. METHODS: two-year-old male baby severe hemolytic anemia low level pyruvate kinase (PK) activity enrolled study. exons PKLR gene flanking sequences amplified patient's genomic DNA using PCR. Bioinformatics software used evaluate functional impacts mutations found study. RESULTS: demonstrated boy harbored previously described mutation (c. 941T>C) exon 7 novel mutation (c. 1183 G>C) exon 9 PKLR gene. mutations led significant structural alterations decreased enzymatic activity PK, predicted tool software. CONCLUSIONS: compound heterozygous mutations PKLR gene cause inherited PKD patient.
