 Oleaginous microalgae emerging third-generation feedstocks biofuel production. Genetic manipulation improving triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation represents promising approach towards economics microalgal biofuels. Acetyl-CoA, essential carbon precursor de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, derived pyruvate catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase, negatively regulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). present study, characterized PDK gene (NsPDK) Nannochloropsis salina. Subcellular localization assay assisted green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion indicated localization NsPDK mitochondria N. salina cells. NsPDK knockdown via RNA interference strategy attenuated NsPDK expression mRNA level enzymatic activity vivo, leading faster TAG accumulation without compromising cell growth high light stress conditions. Interestingly, TAG increase accompanied decline membrane polar lipids. NsPDK knockdown also altered fatty acid profile N. salina. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis suggested carbon metabolic pathways might influenced NsPDK knockdown leading diverted carbon flux towards TAG synthesis. Taken together, results demonstrate role NsPDK regulating TAG accumulation provide valuable insights future manipulation oleaginous microalgae improving biofuel production.
