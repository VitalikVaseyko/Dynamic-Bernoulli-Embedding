 human pyruvate kinase (PK) L-gene organized 12 exons 9.5 kilobases, first second exons specifically transcribed R- L-type PK mRNA. 5'-flanking region upstream first exon two CAC boxes four GATA motifs within 250 bp translational initiation codon. Comparison rat L-gene revealed four well-conserved elements region. transient transfection demonstrated 270-bp upstream region powerful promoter K562 cells, whereas deletion distal 150-bp sequences, included three GATA motifs, resulted drastic reduction activity. hypersensitive site 2 human beta-globin gene locus joined promoter, activity proximal 120-bp region enhanced. concluded proximal 120-bp region basal promoter activity distal 150-bp region acted enhancer erythroid cells.
