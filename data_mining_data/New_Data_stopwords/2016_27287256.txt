 Accelerated glycolysis, common process tumor cells called Warburg effect, associated various biological phenomena. However, role glycolysis induced arsenite, well-established human carcinogen, unknown. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act regulators various cancers, lncRNAs regulate glucose metabolism remains largely unexplored. found that, human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells, arsenite increases lactate production; glucose consumption; expression glycolysis-related genes, including HK-2, Eno-1, Glut-4. L-02 cells exposed arsenite, lncRNA, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs)-alpha, transcriptional regulators cellular response hypoxia, over-expressed. addition, HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, involved arsenite-induced glycolysis, MALAT1 enhances arsenite-induced glycolysis. Although MALAT1 regulates HIF-alpha promotes arsenite-induced glycolysis, MALAT1 promotes glycolysis HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha. Moreover, arsenite-increased MALAT1 enhances disassociation Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor HIF-1alpha, alleviating VHL-mediated ubiquitination HIF-1alpha, causes accumulation HIF-1alpha. sum, findings indicate MALAT1, acting HIF-1alpha stabilization, mediator enhances glycolysis induced arsenite. results provide link induction lncRNAs glycolysis cells exposed arsenite, thus establish previously unknown mechanism arsenite-induced hepatotoxicity.
