 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) overexpressed ovarian cancer thus promising anticancer therapeutic target. previous work suggests coumarin compounds potential inhibitors PDKs. study, used ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 model system examined whether dicumarol (DIC), coumarin compound, could inhibit ovarian cancer targeting PDK1. showed DIC potently inhibited kinase activity PDK1, shifted glucose metabolism aerobic glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation, generated higher level reactive oxygen species (ROS), attenuated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), induced apoptosis, reduced cell viability vitro. phenotypes induced DIC also translated vivo, leading significant suppression xenograft growth. study identifies novel inhibitor PDK1, also reveals novel anticancer mechanisms DIC provides promising anticancer therapy targets Warburg effect.
