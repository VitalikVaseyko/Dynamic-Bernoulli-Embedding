 recent studies SKH-1 hairless mice demonstrated topical exposure nitrogen mustard (NM), analog sulfur mustard (SM), triggers inflammatory response, microvesication apoptotic cell death. Here, sought identify mechanism/s involved NM-induced injury responses. Results obtained show NM exposure SKH-1 hairless mouse skin caused H2A.X p53 phosphorylation increased p53 accumulation, indicating DNA damage. addition, NM also induced activation MAPKs/ERK1/2, JNK1/2 p38 well Akt together activation transcription factor AP1. Also, NM exposure induced robust expression pro-inflammatory mediators namely cyclooxygenase 2 inducible nitric oxide synthase cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha, increased levels proteolytic mediator matrix metalloproteinase 9. NM exposure skin also increased lipid peroxidation, 5,5-dimethyl-2-(8-octanoic acid)-1-pyrroline N-oxide protein adduct formation, protein DNA oxidation indicating elevated oxidative stress. also found NM-induced increase homologous recombinant repair pathway, suggesting involvement repair NM-induced DNA damage. Collectively, results indicate NM induces oxidative stress, mainly bi-phasic response DNA damage activation MAPK Akt pathways, activate transcription factor AP1 induce expression inflammatory proteolytic mediators, contributing skin injury response NM. conclusion, study first time links NM-induced mechanistic changes earlier reported murine skin injury lesions NM, could valuable identify potential therapeutic targets rescue agents.
