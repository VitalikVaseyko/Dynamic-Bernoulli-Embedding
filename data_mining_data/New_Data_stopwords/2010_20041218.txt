 HERC gene family encodes proteins two characteristic domains: HECT RCC1-like. Proteins HECT domains described function ubiquitin ligases, contain RCC1-like domains reported function GTPases regulators. two activities essential number important cellular processes cell cycle, cell signaling, membrane trafficking. Mutations affecting domains found associated retinitis pigmentosa, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer. humans, six HERC genes reported encode two subgroups HERC proteins: large (HERC1-2) small (HERC3-6). giant HERC1 protein first identified. involved membrane trafficking cell proliferation/growth interactions clathrin, M2-pyruvate kinase, TSC2 proteins. Mutations affecting members HERC family found associated sterility growth retardation. Here, report characterization recessive mutation named tambaleante, causes progressive Purkinje cell degeneration leading severe ataxia reduced growth lifespan homozygous mice aged two months. mapped mutation mouse chromosome 9 performed positional cloning. found G<-->A transition position 1448, causing Gly Glu substitution (Gly483Glu) highly conserved N-terminal RCC1-like domain HERC1 protein. Successful transgenic rescue, either mouse BAC containing normal copy Herc1 human HERC1 cDNA, validated findings. Histological biochemical studies revealed extensive autophagy associated increase mutant protein level decrease mTOR activity. observations concerning first mutation Herc1 gene contribute functional annotation encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase underline crucial unexpected role protein Purkinje cell physiology.
