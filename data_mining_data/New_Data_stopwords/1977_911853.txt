 presence SH group protectors, human leukocyte platelet pyruvate kinases demonstrate biphasic kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate substrate. SH group oxidation oxidized glutathione reveals positive cooperativity kinetics purified preparations leukocyte platelet pyruvate kinases. Complete reversal phenomenon may obtained incubation several hours dithiothreitol. communication illustrates existing relationships enzyme conformation, redox state SH groups, observed kinetics.
