 rat pyruvate kinase L (PKL) gene produces L- R-type isozymes alternative transcription regulated tissue-specific manner. investigate DNA elements involved hepatocyte-specific expression L-type isozyme, performed transient DNA transfer experiments PKL/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes. found three positive regulatory regions required expression L-type isozyme adult rat hepatocytes functional analyses series 5' internal deletion constructs fusion genes. regions, designated PKL-I, PKL-II, PKL-III, located nucleotides -76 -94, -126 -149, -150 -170, respectively. PKL-I showed enhancer-like activity alone, whereas PKL-II PKL-III independent effect. Combinations L-I + L-II L-II + L-III, L-I + L-III, showed synergistic enhancer activities oriented direction. inclusion three elements oriented direction maximum synergistic effect, indicating elements function unit. unit enhanced expression heterologous well homologous promoters manner independent orientation position relative cap site. activity unit detected HeLa cells K562 erythroleukemia cells, suggesting unit possessed cell-type specificity. PKL-I consists palindrome sequence 5'-CTGGTTATACTTTAACCAG-3', contain sequence homologous LF-B1-binding site. PKL-II contains sequence 5'-TTCCTGGACTCTGGCCCCCAGTGT-3', similar LF-A1-binding site. PKL-III contains palindrome sequence 5'-CCACGGGGCACTCCCGTGG-3', include sequence homologous binding site adenovirus major late transcription factor. Gel retardation assay indicated different trans-acting factors interacted three elements transacting protein bound PKL-I fact LF-B1. However, trans-acting factors bound PKL-II PKL-III different LF-A1 major late transcription factor, respectively. Thus, conclude three cis-acting elements important specific expression PKL gene hepatocytes LF-B1 two unknown factors bound elements interact cause synergistic effect.
