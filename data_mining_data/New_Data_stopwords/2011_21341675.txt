 Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1(PDK1) master regulator AGC family kinases integral component PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. pathway among commonly deregulated across cancers, selective inhibitor PDK1 might utility anticancer agent. Herein describe lead optimization compound 1 toward highly potent selective PDK1 inhibitors via structure-based design strategy. potent selective inhibitors demonstrated submicromolar activity measured inhibition phosphorylation PDK1 substrates well antiproliferative activity subset AML cell lines. addition, reduction phosphorylation PDK1 substrates demonstrated vivo mice bearing OCl-AML2 xenografts. observations demonstrate utility molecules tools delineate biology PDK1 potential pharmacological uses PDK1 inhibitor.
