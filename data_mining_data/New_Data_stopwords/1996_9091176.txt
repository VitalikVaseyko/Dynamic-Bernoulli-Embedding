 activities 18 enzymes involved intermediary energy metabolism measured certain widely-spread peracarid crustaceans: 3 hypogean (Niphargus virei, Niphargus rhenorhodanensis Stenasellus virei) 2 epigean (Gammarus fossarum Asellus aquaticus) ones. activities numerous enzymes correlated known metabolic rates 5 species. rates reduced hypogean organisms: levels enzymatic activity subterranean species 1.2 8.6 times lower epigean species main key regulatory enzymes involved Krebs cycle glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase citrate synthetase). relative activities phosphofructokinase, glycogen phosphorylase hexokinase clearly indicated glycogen main fuel oxidized epigean hypogean organisms. higher glycogen phosphorylase/hexokinase ratio hypogean epigean crustaceans showed subterranean species greater ability function anaerobically. presence high activities glutamate-pyruvate transaminase lactate dehydrogenase species (and malate dehydrogenase fumarase hypogean species) indicative coupled fermentation glycogen glutamate anaerobiosis, lactate alanine end-products (as well succinate hypogean species). low fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase/phosphofructokinase ratio, associated low level phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, indicated glycolytic pathway active gluconeogenic ability limited epigean crustaceans. contrast, hypogean species, association higher ratio high level phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity suggested low glycolytic activity high gluconeogenic ability.
