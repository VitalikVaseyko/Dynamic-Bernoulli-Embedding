 new reactive adenine nucleotide synthesized: 2-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-adenosine 5'-monophosphate (2-BDB-TAMP). Adenosine 5'-monophosphate 1-oxide synthesized reaction AMP m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Treatment NaOH followed reaction carbon disulfide yielded 2-thioadenosine 5'-monophosphate (TAMP). final product generated reaction TAMP 1,4-dibromobutanedione. structure 2-BDB-TAMP determined UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy well bromide phosphorus analysis. Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase inactivated 2-BDB-TAMP pH 7.0 25 degrees C. inactivation rate exhibits nonlinear dependence reagent concentration KI = 0.57 mM. Protection inactivation provided ADP ATP, presence Mn2+, well phosphoenolpyruvate, presence K+; addition, partial protection provided AMP plus Mn2+. Incubation pyruvate kinase 0.075 mM 2-BDB-TAMP 70 min absence protective ligands leads incorporation 1.55 mol reagent/mol enzyme subunit enzyme 53% inactive. presence ADP Mn2+, 0.96 mol reagent/mol subunit incorporated 70 min, enzyme retains 100% activity. Similar results obtained presence ATP plus Mn2+. Assuming groups modified absence ligands include modified presence nucleotides, 53% inactivation attributed modification 0.59 (1.55-0.96) group per enzyme subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
