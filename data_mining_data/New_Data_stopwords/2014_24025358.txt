 omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3PUFAs) class lipids biologically effective treatment inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular disease cancer. Patients consuming high dietary intake omega3PUFAs shown low incidence metabolic disorders, including cancer. Although effects omega3PUFAs intake shown involved prevention treatment diseases, underlying molecular mechanisms involved well understood. Here, show omega3PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) enhanced tumor suppressor function LKB1. observed LKB1 expressing cells treated DHA, increase LKB1 activity leading phosphorylation AMPK inhibition mTOR signaling. Abrogation LKB1 MCF-7 cells siRNA reversed phenotype. Furthermore, cellular metabolism altered ATP levels reduced response DHA treatment, attenuated cells expressing LKB1. importantly, mammary epithelial cells expressing LKB1, rate glycolysis decreased result diminished expression glycolytic enzymes. Functionally, events lead decrease migration potential cells. Overall, discovery shows first time LKB1 function enhanced response omega3PUFA treatment, thereby resulting regulation cell metabolism.
