 Sustained oscillations investigated open homogeneous enzyme system reconstituted phosphofructokinase, fructose 1,6- biphosphatase , pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase. generation oscillations mainly due antagonistic kinetic effects AMP phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6- biphosphatase experimental conditions applied. Sustained oscillations obtained broad range maximum activities phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6- biphosphatase increased. low maximum activities two enzymes oscillations arise, form folded limit cycle, increasing concentrations phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase sustained oscillations introduced, restricted two dimensions.
