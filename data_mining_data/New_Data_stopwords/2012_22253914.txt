 lean humans, increasing dietary fat intake causes increase whole-body fat oxidation changes genes regulate fat oxidation skeletal muscle, whether occurs obese humans known. compared changes whole-body fat oxidation markers muscle oxidative capacity differ lean (LN) obese (OB) adults exposed 2-day high-fat (HF) diet. Ten LN (BMI = 22.5+/-2.5 kg/m(2), age = 30+/-8 yrs) nine OB (BMI = 35.9+/-4.93 kg/m(2), 38+/-5 yrs, Mean+/-SD) studied room calorimeter 24hr consuming isocaloric low-fat (LF, 20% energy) HF (50% energy) diets. muscle biopsy obtained next morning following overnight fast. 24h respiratory quotient (RQ) significantly differ groups (LN: 0.91+/-0.01; OB: 0.92+/-0.01) LF, similarly decreased HF LN (0.86+/-0.01) OB (0.85+/-0.01). expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) fatty acid transporter CD36 increased LN OB HF. changes mRNA protein observed. However, LN OB, amounts acetylated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-alpha (PGC1-alpha) significantly decreased phosphorylated 5-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) significantly increased. response isoenergetic increase dietary fat, whole-body fat oxidation similarly increases LN OB, association shift towards oxidative metabolism skeletal muscle, suggesting ability adapt acute increase dietary fat impaired obesity.
