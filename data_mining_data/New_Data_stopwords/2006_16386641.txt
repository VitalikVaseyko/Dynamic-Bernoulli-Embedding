 Metabolic alterations characterized various heart diseases. However, data available concerning metabolic changes acute rejection episodes. Heterotopic heart transplantations rats done using Lewis rats donors recipients control group. rejection group included Brown-Norway rat donors Lewis rat recipients. Nonoperated hearts also studied. Enzyme activities determined phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase. alterations control group compared nonoperated hearts. However, rejection cohort hearts showed decreased glycolytic enzymes. Although lactate dehydrogenase maintained similar levels compared control group, phosphofructokinase showed 50% activity, pyruvate kinase showed less 10% activity compared controls. results suggested metabolic alterations rejected hearts differ cardiomyopathies.
