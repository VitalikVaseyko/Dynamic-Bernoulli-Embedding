 Estimates activities (Vmax) six enzymes involved de novo fat synthesis made replicated lines mice differing fat content. lines selected high low 20 generations three replicates Fat, Control Lean lines eight generations high low unreplicated line. activities ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthetase (FAS), cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (MDH), malic enzyme (ME) pyruvate kinase (PK) determined vitro liver gonadal fatpad tissues taken ages five ten weeks. activities ACL, ACC, FAS significantly higher Fat Lean lines, differences pronounced earlier age gonadal fatpad activities Fat lines higher factors 3.5, 2.4, 2.5 3.5 respectively. activity PK unchanged tissue. MDH activity significantly lower adipose tissue Fat lines Lean lines age ten weeks age five weeks liver tissue. Results replicates indicated random genetic drift affected enzyme activities nevertheless significant changes activity associated direction selection. changes enzyme activity reported similar known associated major mutations causing obesity mice.
