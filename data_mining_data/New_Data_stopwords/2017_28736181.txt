 Altered mitochondrial oxidation increases vulnerability cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury metabolic disorders. However, metabolic signaling responsible dysfunction remains partly unknown. sought test whether hypoxic succinate accumulation could inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity subsequently aggravate I/R injury. Results showed saturated fatty acid palmitate stimulation increased fatty acid oxidation induced hypoxia cardiomyocytes, leading succinate accumulation. Intracellular succinate induced hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression impaired PDH activity via upregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) expression. Luciferase reporter assay showed succinate increased PDK4 expression gene promoter induction HIF-1alpha-dependent manner. Palmitate also induced release succinate extracellular space. activating GRP91, extracellular succinate induced translocation PKCdelta mitochondria exacerbated PDH impairment. results demonstrated succinate impaired PDH activity via GPR91-dependent independent pathways. Ginsenoside Rb1 (a major compound isolated ginseng) trimetazidine (fatty acid beta-oxidation inhibitor) prevented hypoxic succinate accumulation cardiomyocytes improved PDH activity blocking succinate-associated HIF-1alpha activation GPR91 signaling. improving PDH activity, Rb1 trimetazidine prevented cardiac acidification, ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction thereby reduced apoptosis hypoxia/reoxygenation insult. isolated working rat hearts perfused palmitate high-fat diet-fed mice, early intervention Rb1 trimetazidine reduced succinate production resultantly increased heart resistance ischemia/reperfusion injury. Taken together, findings demonstrated early intervention targeting inhibition succinate accumulation-induced PDH impairment effective strategy alleviate I/R injury.
