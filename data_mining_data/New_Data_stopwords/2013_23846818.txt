 CONTEXT: Many tumor cells predominantly generate energy high rates glycolysis. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) identified necessary aerobic glycolysis. OBJECTIVE: aim study investigate expression pattern PKM2 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) possible role PKM2 PTC. DESIGN: expression PKM2 human thyroid tissues examined using immunocytochemistry. PKM2 expression PTC correlated clinicopathological features BRAF mutation. PTC cells transfected small interfering RNA PKM2. PKM2 expression cells analyzed Western blotting real-time RT-PCR. Cell growth evaluated vitro vivo. Lactate ATP production glucose consumption cells determined using commercial assay kits. RESULTS: PKM2 aberrantly overexpressed PTC. overexpression associated poor clinicopathological features including advanced tumor stages lymph node metastasis. intensive immunostaining PKM2 detected PTCs harboring BRAF mutation. Specific small interfering RNA PKM2 PTC cell lines retarded cell growth vitro xenograft mouse models. PKM2 knockdown also reduced lactate ATP production glucose consumption PTC cells. CONCLUSIONS: conclude overexpression PKM2 provides selective growth advantage PTC cells activation glycolysis. Aberrant PKM2 overexpression may serve novel biomarker potential treatment target PTC. BRAF mutation may contribute alterations expression pattern glycolytic enzymes PKM2.
