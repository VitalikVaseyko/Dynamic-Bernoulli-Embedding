 Intense interest 'Warburg effect' revived discovery hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) reprogrammes pyruvate oxidation lactic acid conversion; lactic acid end product fermentative glycolysis. aggressive invasive cancers, often hypoxic, rely exacerbated glycolysis meet increased demand ATP biosynthetic precursors also rely robust pH-regulating systems combat excessive generation lactic carbonic acids. Review, present key pH-regulating systems synthesize recent advances strategies combine disruption pH control bioenergetic mechanisms. discuss possibility exploiting, rapidly growing tumours, acute cell death 'metabolic catastrophe'.
