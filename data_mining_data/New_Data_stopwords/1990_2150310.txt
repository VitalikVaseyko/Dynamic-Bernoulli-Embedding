 continuing study interactions glycolytic enzymes cytoskeletal structure, influence variation pH eluting medium investigated. treatment resulted increased degree binding glycolytic enzymes decrease pH, marked increases binding occurring phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, enolase pyruvate kinase. significance data discussed reference relative affinities interaction individual glycolytic components physiological correlations phenomena.
