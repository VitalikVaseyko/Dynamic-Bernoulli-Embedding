 Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) enzyme-catalyzing conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate glycolysis pathway. demonstrated PKM2 interacts tyrosine phosphopeptide, interaction tyrosine phosphopeptide affects pyruvate kinase activity PKM2. experiments suggest PKM2 also active protein kinase (Gao, X., Wang, H., Yang, J. J., Liu, X., Liu, Z. R. (2012) Mol. Cell 45, 598-609). report growth signals reciprocally regulate pyruvate kinase protein kinase activities PKM2 different mechanisms. one hand, growth signals induce protein tyrosine phosphorylations. tyrosine-phosphorylated protein(s) regulates conversion pyruvate kinase protein kinase PKM2 directly interacting PKM2. Binding tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-binding site converts tetrameric PKM2 dimer. hand, growth stimulations also lead PKM2 phosphorylation, consequently regulates conversion protein kinase pyruvate kinase activities. Growth factor stimulations significantly increase dimer/tetramer PKM2 ratio cells consequently activate protein kinase activity PKM2. study suggests conversion pyruvate kinase protein kinase activities PKM2 may important mechanism mediating effects growth signals promoting cell proliferation.
