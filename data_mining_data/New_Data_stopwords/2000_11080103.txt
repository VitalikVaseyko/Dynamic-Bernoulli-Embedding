 previous phylogenetic analysis among 15 taxa teleost fish Fundulus suggested thermal-adaptive differences heart metabolism among populations. test hypothesis, rate oxygen consumption activities 11 glycolytic enzymes measured isolated heart ventricle two populations Fundulus heteroclitus. Heart ventricular metabolism greater northern population versus southern population fish. Analysis amount glycolytic enzymes indicates 87% variation cardiac metabolism within populations explained variation three enzymes (pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase). enzymes three enzymes predicted important based previously determined phylogenetic patterns expression. data indicate near-equilibrium enzymes, well classically defined rate-limiting enzymes, also influence metabolism.
