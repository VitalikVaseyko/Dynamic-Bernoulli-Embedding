 Kluyveromyces-like intergeneric hybrids thermotolerant Kluyveromyces marxianus non-thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae, produced previous study protoplasmic fusion, characterized. molasses, strains produced ethanol excess 6% (v/v) 30 45 degrees C 3% 4.2% (v/v) former parent 30 45 degrees C, respectively. hybrids, increase ethanol production appeared sequel increased activities alcohol dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, derived probably S. cerevisiae parent. Hybrid ADH-isozyme pattern polyacrylamide gel corroborated presence S. cerevisiae ADH tested hybrids. Regression analyses indicated positive correlation ethanol production ADH PK (r approximately 0.76-0.84).
