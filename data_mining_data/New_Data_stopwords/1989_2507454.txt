 study special care taken discriminate direct effect ethanol hepatocarcinogenesis secondary effects choline deficiency fatty liver. Rats divided 2 groups, N. Group initiated using 3'-Me-DAB, control group N initiated. Groups N divided 4 sub-groups. subgroup given, drinking water, one following ethanol solutions: 0, 5, 10 15% 45 weeks. Liver tumors induced groups. Evidence obtained indicates that: (a) N group, ethanol cause apparent disorders histology lipid metabolism, (b) group significant differences observed incidence HCCs liver lesions. Ethanol thus appear enhance hepatocarcinogenesis, least absence liver injury.
