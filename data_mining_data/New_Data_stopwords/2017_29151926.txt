 Reprogramming cellular metabolism hallmark cancers. Cancer cells readily use glycolysis, inefficient metabolic pathway energy metabolism, even sufficient oxygen available. reliance aerobic glycolysis called Warburg effect, promotes tumorigenesis malignancy progression. mechanisms glycolytic shift tumors fully understood. Growing evidence demonstrates many signal molecules, including oncogenes tumor suppressors, involved process, oncogenic signals attenuate mitochondrial function promote switch glycolysis remains unclear. Here, summarize current information several main mediators discuss possible mechanisms triggering Warburg effect.
