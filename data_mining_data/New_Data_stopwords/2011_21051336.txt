 present relational database EDULISS (EDinburgh University Ligand Selection System), stores structural, physicochemical pharmacophoric properties small molecules. database comprises collection 4 million commercially available compounds 28 different suppliers. user-friendly web-based interface EDULISS (available http://eduliss.bch.ed.ac.uk/) established providing number data-mining possibilities. compound single 3D conformer stored along 1600 calculated descriptor values (molecular properties). efficient method unique compound recognition, especially large scale database, demonstrated making use small subgroups descriptors. Many shape distance descriptors held pre-calculated bit strings permitting fast efficient similarity pharmacophore searches used identify families related compounds biological testing. Two ligand searching applications given demonstrate EDULISS used extract families molecules selected structural biophysical features.
