 Oral administration tungstate 15 days normalized glycemia streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Simultaneously, alterations hepatic glucose metabolism due diabetes almost completely counteracted treatment. Thus, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, L-pyruvate kinase, glycogen phosphorylase alpha activities reached levels similar observed healthy animals. Hepatic levels fructose 2,6-bisphosphate glycogen also recovered. However, recovery glucokinase activity hepatic levels glucose 6-phosphate partial. total activity glycogen synthase increased, although activation state recovered. Moreover, mRNA levels hepatic glucokinase, glycogen phosphorylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase also normalized. Tungstate administration healthy animals also affected parameters, although much lesser extent. effects similar previously reported vanadate, suggesting common mechanism action vivo.
