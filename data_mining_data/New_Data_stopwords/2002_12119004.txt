 Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) family detoxification isozymes protect cells conjugating GSH variety toxic compounds, may also play role regulation cellular proliferation apoptosis. previously shown human GST P1-1, widely distributed extrahepatic isozyme, could inactivated catechol estrogen metabolite 4-hydroxyequilenin (4-OHEN) vitro [Chang, M., Shin, Y. G., van Breemen, R. B., Blond, S. Y., Bolton, J. L. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 4811-4820]. present study, found 4-OHEN another catechol estrogen, 4,17beta-hydroxyequilenin (4,17beta-OHEN), significantly decreased GSH levels activity GST within minutes estrogen receptor (ER) negative (MDA-MB-231) ER positive (S30) human breast cancer cells. addition, 4-OHEN caused significant decreases GST activity nontransformed human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) human hepatoma HepG2 cells, lack GST P1-1. also showed GSH partially protected inactivation GST P1-1 4-OHEN vitro, depletion cellular GSH enhanced 4-OHEN-induced inhibition GST activity. addition, 4-OHEN GSH conjugates contributed 27% inactivation GST P1-1 4-OEHN vitro. vitro kinetic inhibition experiments 4-OHEN showed GST P1-1 lower K(i) value (20.8 microM) compared glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 52.4 microM), P450 reductase (PR, 77.4 microM), pyruvate kinase (PK, 159 microM), glutathione reductase (GR, 230 microM), superoxide dismutase (SOD, 448 microM), catalase (562 microM), GST M1-1 (620 microM), thioredoxin reductase (TR, 694 microM), glutathione peroxidase (GPX, 1410 microM). contrast significant inhibition total GST activity human breast cancer cells, 4-OHEN slightly inhibited cellular GAPDH activity, cellular enzymes including PR, PK, GR, SOD, catalase, TR, GPX resistant 4-OHEN-induced inhibition. data suggest GST P1-1 may preferred protein target equine catechol estrogens vivo.
