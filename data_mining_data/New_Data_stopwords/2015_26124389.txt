 BACKGROUND/AIM: Tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) up-regulated proliferating tissues. shown tumor M2-PK detectable quantifiable stool plasma patients colorectal cancer (CRC). Tumor M2-PK extensively studied gastrointestinal tumors role cancer types yet deeply evaluated. aim study determine compare plasma tumor M2-PK levels different cancer types. MATERIALS METHODS: patients undergoing diagnostics cancer Hospital 2011 included study (n=139). Plasma tumor M2-PK concentration analyzed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: different cancer types found study were: 60 colorectal, 43 breast, 8 lung, 5 prostatic, 4 ovarian remaining 19 cases uncommon tumor types. tumors high concentrations tumor M2-PK; prostatic, pharyngeal testicular tumors levels lower near cut-off. Plasma tumor M2-PK levels significantly higher patients distant metastases stage IV TNM. CONCLUSION: Plasma tumor M2-PK specific marker CRC elevated many types cancers, including breast, lung, ovarian, thyroid. Small amounts found prostatic, pharyngeal testicular tumors.
