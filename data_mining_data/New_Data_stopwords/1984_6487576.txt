 mechanism allosteric regulation rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) examined presence allosteric inhibitor phenylalanine (Phe). Steady-state kinetic, equilibrium binding, structural studies conducted provide broad data base establish reasonable model interactions. Phe shown induce apparent cooperativity steady-state kinetic measurements pH 7.5 23 degrees C. apparent Km phosphoenolpyruvate shown increase increasing Phe concentrations. results imply Phe reduces affinity PK phosphoenolpyruvate. conclusion substantiated equilibrium binding studies yielded association constants phosphoenolpyruvate function Phe concentration. binding constant Phe also determined pH 7.0 23 degrees C. effect ligands hydrodynamic properties PK monitored difference sedimentation velocity, sedimentation velocity, equilibrium experiments. results showed PK remains tetrameric presence absence Phe. However, Phe induces small decrease sedimentation coefficient enzyme; hence, suggests loosening protein structure. accessibility sulfhydryl residues enzyme also increases presence Phe. Furthermore, Phe-induced conformational change approximately 90% complete 25% binding sites saturated. result suggested regulatory behavior PK might satisfactorily described two-state model Monod-Wyman-Changeux [Monod, J., Wyman, J., & Changeux, J.-P.
