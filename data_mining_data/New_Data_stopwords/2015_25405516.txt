 Cancer cells prefer metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect. plays crucial role proliferation progression cancer cells. However, complete mechanism remains elusive. recent studies, signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling discovered roles cancerassociated changes metabolism. study, find ginsenoside 20(S)Rg3, pharmacologically active component traditional Chinese herb Panax ginseng, inhibits glycolysis ovarian cancer cells regulating hexokinase 2 (HK2) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). also show 20(S)Rg3 regulates HK2 downregulation pSTAT3 (Tyr705). Furthermore, overexpression STAT3 ovarian cancer cells weakened suppression Warburg effect induced 20(S)Rg3. Importantly, 20(S)Rg3 treatment represses HK2 expression nude mouse xenograft models ovarian cancer. Taken together, results show 20(S)Rg3 inhibits Warburg effect targeting STAT3/HK2 pathway ovarian cancer cells, highlighting potentiality 20(S)Rg3 used therapeutic agent ovarian cancer.
