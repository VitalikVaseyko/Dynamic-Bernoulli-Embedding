 discovery, synthesis, optimization compound 1 high-throughput screening hit highly potent selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) agonists reported. synthesis structure-activity relationship series described detail. basis general schematic PPAR pharmacophore model, scaffold 1 divided headgroup, linker, tailgroup successively optimized PPAR activation using vitro PPAR transactivation assays. (2-methylphenoxy)acetic acid headgroup, flexible linker, five-membered heteroaromatic center ring two hydrophobic aryl substituents required efficient selective PPARdelta activation. fine-tuning aryl substituents led array highly potent selective compounds compound 38c, displaying excellent pharmacokinetic profile mouse. vivo acute dosing model, selected members array shown induce expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3), genes known involved energy homeostasis regulated PPARdelta skeletal muscle.
