 variety genomic proteomic tools used study cancer metabolism metabolomics order understand cancer cells survive environment. Throughout past decade, mass spectrometry routinely used large-scale protein identification complex biological mixtures. review, discuss recent developments cancer metabolism proteomic analysis using mass spectrometric techniques, focusing pyruvate kinase, L-lactate dehydrogenase, Warburg effect, glutamine metabolism oxidative stress.
