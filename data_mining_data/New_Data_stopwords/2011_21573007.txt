 Mycoplasma suis, causative agent porcine infectious anemia, never cultured vitro mechanisms causes disease poorly understood. Thus, objective herein use whole genome sequencing analysis M. suis define pathogenicity mechanisms biochemical pathways. M. suis harvested blood experimentally infected pig. Following DNA extraction construction paired end library, whole-genome sequencing performed using GS-FLX (454) Titanium chemistry. Reads paired-end constructs assembled using GS De Novo Assembler gaps closed primer walking; assembly validated PFGE. Glimmer Manatee Annotation Engine used predict annotate protein-coding sequences (CDS). M. suis genome consists single, 742,431 bp chromosome low G+C content 31.1%. total 844 CDS, 3 single copies, unlinked rRNA genes 32 tRNAs identified. Gene homologies GC skew graph show M. suis typical Mollicutes oriC. predicted metabolic pathway concise, showing evidence adaptation blood environment. M. suis glycolytic species, obtaining energy sugars fermentation ATP-synthase. pentose-phosphate pathway, metabolism cofactors vitamins, pyruvate dehydrogenase NAD(+) kinase missing. Thus, ribose, NADH, NADPH coenzyme possibly essential growth. M. suis generate purines hypoxanthine, secreted RBCs, cytidine nucleotides uracil. Toxins orthologs identified. suggest M. suis may cause disease scavenging competing host' nutrients, leading decreased life-span RBCs. summary, genome analysis shows M. suis dependent host cell metabolism characteristic likely linked pathogenicity. prediction essential nutrients aid development vitro cultivation systems.
