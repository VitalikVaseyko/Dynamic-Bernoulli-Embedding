 nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, associated pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency apparently inherited dominant trait identified family. affected members, residual PK activities 20% normal controls, unusually low level heterozygous subjects. anemia mild except proband, 2-year-old boy suffered severe anemia. PKs proband parents characterized kinetically electrophoretically normal enzymes. Immunoprecipitation tests indicated large amount L-type inactive protein proband father. Moreover, M2 type PK present father's hemolysate, suggesting existence compensatory process derepressed corresponding structural gene. suggest presence one mutated subunits tetrameric forms L-type PK leads inactivation tetramers. hypothesis accounts low residual activity affected heterozygous members family. severity hematological symptoms proband, comparison mild hemolysis observed heterozygous members family points existence large spectrum pathologic expression identical PK defect present family.
