 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms 2 3 produced via co-expression chaperonins GroEL GroES purified high specific activities affinity tag-free forms. using human components, evaluated binding lipoyl domains dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) produces predominant changes rates phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component PDK2 PDK3. E2 assembles 60-mer via C-terminal domain mobile connections E1-binding domain two lipoyl domains, L2 L1 N terminus. PDK3 activated 17-fold E2; majority activation facilitated free L2 domain (half-maximal activation 3.3 microm L2). direct activation PDK3 L2 domain resulted 12.8-fold increase k(cat) along 2-fold decrease K(m) PDK3 E1. PDK3 poorly inhibited pyruvate dichloroacetate (DCA). PDK3 activity stimulated upon reductive acetylation L1 L2 full activation PDK3 E2 avoided (e.g. using free lipoyl domains ADP-inhibited E2-activated PDK3). marked contrast, PDK2 responsive free lipoyl domains, E2-60-mer enhanced PDK2 activity 10-fold. E2 activation PDK2 resulted greatly enhanced sensitivity inhibition pyruvate DCA; pyruvate effective significantly lower levels DCA. E2-activated PDK2 activity stimulated >/=3-fold reductive acetylation E2; stimulated PDK2 retained high sensitivity inhibition ADP DCA. Thus, PDK3 directly activated L2 domain, fully activated PDK3 relatively insensitive feed-forward (pyruvate) feed-back (acetylating) effectors. PDK2 activated assembled E2, activated state beget high responsiveness effectors.
