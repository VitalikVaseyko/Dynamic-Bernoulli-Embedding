 Diabetes vascular calcification intrinsically linked. previously reported advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accelerate calcium deposition vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) via excessive oxidative stress. However, underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) important mitochondrial matrix enzyme cellular energy metabolism. Since hyperactivation PDK4 reported calcified vessels patients diabetes mellitus, inhibition PDK4 expression may strategy prevention diabetic vascular calcification. study, used rat VSMC model investigate role PDK4 diabetic vascular calcification explore underlying mechanisms. observed Nepsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), major immunogen AGEs, accelerated calcium deposition VSMCs PDK4 activation. elevated level reactive oxygen species (ROS) acted signal transduction intermediate increase PDK4 expression. Either inhibition PDK4 expression RAGE (receptor AGEs) blockade attenuated CML-induced VSMC calcification, shown decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Glucose consumption lactate production increased CML-induced VSMC calcification. Importantly, CML accelerates glycolysis VSMCs via PDK4-dependent pathway. conclusion, study demonstrates novel mechanism CML promotes VSMC calcification via PDK4 activation alters glucose metabolism VSMCs.
