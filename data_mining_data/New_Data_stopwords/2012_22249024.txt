 BACKGROUND: Poly-N-acetyl glucosamine nanofibers derived marine diatom used increase cutaneous wound healing. nanofibers exert activity specifically activating integrins, makes useful tool dissecting integrin-mediated pathways. shown short-fiber poly-N-acetyl glucosamine nanofiber (sNAG) treatment endothelial cells results increased cell motility metabolic rate absence increased cell proliferation. RESULTS: Using Seahorse Bioanalyzer measure oxygen consumption real time, show sNAG treatment increases oxygen consumption rates, correlated integrin-dependent activation Akt1. Akt1 activation leads increase expression transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). due increased mitochondrial biogenesis, associated increase expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), suggesting regulation fatty acid oxidation. Blockade fatty acid oxidation etomoxir, O-carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 inhibitor, blocks sNAG-dependent increased oxygen consumption. (3)H-palmitate uptake experiments indicate PDK4-dependent increase fatty acid oxidation, required nanofiber-induced cell motility. CONCLUSIONS: findings imply linear pathway whereby integrin-dependent activation Akt1 leads increased PGC-1alpha PDK4 expression resulting increased energy production fatty acid oxidation.
