 describe new enzymatic determination urinary guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) guanidinoacetate kinase (ATP: guanidinoacetate N-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.3.1), require blank correct endogenous constituents (ADP pyruvate). first step, pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) lactate dehydrogenase (L-lactate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27) used eliminate endogenous constituents (ADP pyruvate) presence phosphoenolpyruvate NADH. second step, urinary GAA phosphorylated presence ATP guanidinoacetate kinase form phosphoguanidinoacetate ADP. resultant ADP sequentially measured 340 nm coupled reaction catalyzed pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. standard curve linear 20 mg/dl standard solutions GAA. Analytical recovery GAA added normal urines ranged 97.0 103.2% (mean 100.7%). within-run between-run studies gave CV values less equal 3.6% less equal 4.8%, respectively. significant interference endogenous urinary compounds observed proposed method study. results obtained present method correlated well obtained high-performance liquid chromatographic method. method accurate simple, less time-consuming previously reported. determined concentrations GAA 24-h urine samples proposed method, observed urinary excretion GAA decreased markedly patients renal failure.
