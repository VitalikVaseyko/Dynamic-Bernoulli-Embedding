 OBJECTIVES: Effect rutin lipophilic derivatives Ca2+-ATPase sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) oxidized hypochloric acid peroxynitrite investigated examine role flavonoids SERCA activity modulation. METHODS: Ca2+-ATPase activity measured spectrophotometrically 37 degrees C using NADH-coupled enzyme pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay. SERCA oxidized HOCl (3 min) ONOO- (30 s) previous treatment flavonoids (2 min) 37 degrees C. Lipophilic rutin derivatives prepared lipase-catalyzed esterification flavonoids fatty acids. RESULTS: hypochloric acid (HOCl) peroxynitrite (ONOO-) decreased ATPase activity concentration-dependently IC50 50+/-10 micromol/l 150+/-15 micromol/l, respectively. Rutin found protective effect SERCA activity oxidation systems concentration range 5 - 250 micromol/l. Lipophilic rutin derivatives (rutin oleate, rutin linoleate, rutin linolenate) exerted inhibitory effect ATPase activity presence absence oxidants. CONCLUSION: results suggest selective lipophilization flavonoid skeleton may represent useful tool SERCA activity modulation.
