 developed simultaneous bioluminescent measurement acetate kinase (AK) pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) activities application tandem enzyme immunoassay. principle proposed assay follows. first step, AK generates ATP ADP acetylphosphate, ATP determined firefly luciferase-luciferin reaction. second step, bioluminescent intensity AK eliminated adding glucose ADP-dependent hexokinase, forms AMP ADP. time, PPDK catalyzes interconversion AMP, diphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate ATP, phosphate pyruvate. ATP formed PPDK also determined firefly luciferase-luciferin reaction. detection limits (at blank + 3SD) AK PPDK 1.03 x 10(-20) 2.05 x 10(-20) mol per assay, respectively. method applicable bioluminescent enzyme immunoassay assay insulin C-peptide sample.
