 method based isothermal calorimetry described direct kinetic assay pyruvate kinase. agreement earlier findings based standard coupled assay system enzyme presence fixed ADP concentration, essentially rectangular hyperbolic dependence initial velocity upon phosphoenolpyruvate concentration rendered sigmoidal allosteric inhibitor phenylalanine. effect phenylalanine countered including high concentration space-filling osmolyte proline reaction mixtures. investigation thus affords dramatic example illustrates need consider potential consequences thermodynamic nonideality kinetics enzyme reactions crowded molecular environments cell cytoplasm.
