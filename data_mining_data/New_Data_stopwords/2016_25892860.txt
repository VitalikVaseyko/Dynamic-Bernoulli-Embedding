 Point-of-care (POC) tests enable rapid results well established medical practice. Recent advances analytical techniques led new generation POC devices alter gastrointestinal diagnostic pathways. review aims identify current new technologies POC diagnosis gastrointestinal cancer. structured search Embase Medline databases performed. Papers reporting diagnostic tests gastrointestinal cancer available POC device containing description feasibility POC application included. Studies recovered heterogeneous therefore results presented narrative review. Six diagnostic methods identified (fecal occult blood, fecal proteins, volatile organic compounds, pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2, tumour markers DNA analysis). Fecal occult blood testing reported sensitivity 66%-85% specificity greater 95%. others range development clinical application. POC devices proven role diagnosis gastrointestinal cancer. Barriers implementation exist transition experimental clinical medicine currently slow. New technologies demonstrate potential provide accurate POC tests ability diagnose gastrointestinal cancer early stage improved clinical outcome survival.
