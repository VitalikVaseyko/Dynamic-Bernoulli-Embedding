 Effects dietary alpha-lipoic acid hepatic serum lipid concentrations activity mRNA levels lipogenic enzymes examined rats. Rats fed experimental diets containing varying amounts lipoic acid (0, 1, 2.5, 5 g/kg) 21 d. Lipoic acid profoundly decreased serum liver concentrations TAG, also lowered serum concentrations phospholipid NEFA, concentration cholesterol liver. hypoglycaemic effect compound also observed. Lipoic acid dose-dependently decreased activity mRNA levels fatty acid synthase, ATP-citrate lyase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme pyruvate kinase liver despite reductions considerably attenuated NADPH-producing enzymes. compound also dose-dependently lowered mRNA levels spot 14, adiponutrin, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, Delta5- Delta6-desaturases. addition, lipoic acid dose-dependently lowered serum concentrations insulin leptin, increased adiponectin. Lipoic acid appeared reduce hepatic lipogenesis hence decreases serum liver lipid levels. Alterations serum concentrations insulin (or) adiponectin may trigger consequence.
