 active site pyruvate kinase (PYK) located AC core enzyme mobile lid corresponding domain B. Many PYK structures already determined, first `effector-only' structure first PEP (the true natural substrate) reported enzyme Trypanosoma brucei. PEP soaked crystals enzyme bound allosteric activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP) Mg(2+) triggers substantial 23 degrees rotation B domain `in crystallo', resulting partially closed active site. interplay side chains Mg(2+) PEP may explain mechanism domain movement. Furthermore, apparent F26BP present PEP absent Mg(2+) occupies position distinct two canonical Mg(2+)-binding sites active site. third site adjacent active site involves amino-acid side chains canonical site 1 altered orientations. Site 3 acts sequester Mg(2+) `priming' position enzyme maintained R-state conformation. way, Mg(2+) cooperates F26BP ensure enzyme conformation high affinity substrate.
