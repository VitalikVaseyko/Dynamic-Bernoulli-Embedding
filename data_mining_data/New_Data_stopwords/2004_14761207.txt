 solid tumors, O(2) partial pressure drops 10 mmHg, ATP levels rapidly decrease due Warburg effect. known certain macrocyclic polyamines catalyze chemical hydrolysis ATP release inorganic phosphate. Since tumor cells diminished ATP levels compared normal cells, attempted deplete cellular ATP macrocyclic polyamines effort inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Five macrocyclic polyamines, related budmunchamine family alkaloids, prepared total synthesis. [17]-N(4) macrocycle 1, [16]-N(4) macrocycle 20, [18]-N(4) macrocycle 13, [20]-N(5) macrocycle 8, [13]-N(3) macrocycle 17. one hydrolyzed ATP vitro release P(i); largest ring macrocycle 8 efficient catalyst, smallest ring macrocycle 17 least efficient (P(i) released runs order 40-100 microM). linear polyamine spermine hydrolytic effect ATP. macrocycles found cytotoxic assessed means MTT assay two human prostate cell lines, DuPro PC-3, resultant ID(50) values ranging 0.5 1.8 microM. Colony forming efficiency (CFE) assays performed DuPro cells, macrocycles used concentration range 1-8 microM, confirmed cytotoxic effect macrocycle. killed 3-4 log DuPro cells. smallest ring 17 least cytotoxic 24 h incubation, although 144 h incubation showed significant cytotoxicity 8 microM. macrocycles equally efficient depleting intracellular ATP pools; 24 h incubation macrocycle 17 1-8 microM concentrations, cellular ATP concentrations decreased 3 orders magnitude. decrease ATP levels pronounced 72 h incubation, even 17 reduced ATP 2 orders magnitude. linear pentamine established cytotoxicity without effect ATP pools. macrocycles depleted almost entirely intracellular pools polyamines efficiently taken cells. rough correlation could established cytotoxic effect macrocyclic polyamines ATP-ase like activity DuPro cell line. ATP scarce metabolite cancer cells, replenished ATP-inefficient glycolytic pathway; macrocyclic polyamines appear promising new anticancer agents.
