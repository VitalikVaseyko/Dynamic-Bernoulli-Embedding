 RAS signalling involved control several metabolic pathways including glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration glutamine metabolism. Importantly, found loss PDHK4, key regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, caused profound cell growth inhibition tumour cells harbouring KRAS mutations. Using isogenic cells panel colorectal lung cell lines demonstrated KRAS mutant cells showed dependency PDHK4 whereas KRAS wild-type cells significantly resistant PDHK4 knockdown. found PDHK4 plays role post-translational regulation mutant KRAS activity. Depletion PDHK4 causes disruption KRAS cellular localization, reduction KRAS activity which, turn, results reduced MAPK signalling. Interestingly, PDHK4 KRAS depletion resulted similar metabolic phenotype consisting reduction glucose fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, stable expression PDHK4 increased localization activated KRAS plasma membrane induced tumour cell growth vitro vivo. Taken together data support model PDHK4 regulates KRAS signalling tumorigenic properties suggest inhibition PDHK4 could represent novel therapeutic strategy target KRAS mutant colorectal lung cancers.
