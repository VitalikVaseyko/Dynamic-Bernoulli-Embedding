 Increased glucose uptake accumulation lactate, even normoxic conditions (i.e., aerobic glycolysis Warburg Effect), common feature cancer cells. phenomenon clearly indicates lactate surrogate tumor hypoxia. Tumor lactate predict metastases overall survival patients, shown several studies different entities. Metastasis tumors promoted lactate-induced secretion hyaluronan tumor-associated fibroblasts create milieu favorable migration. Lactate found induce migration cells cell clusters. Furthermore, radioresistance positively correlated lactate concentrations, suggesting antioxidative capacity lactate. Findings interactions tumor metabolites immune cells indicate contribution lactate immune escape. Furthermore, lactate bridges gap high lactate levels wound healing, chronic inflammation, cancer development. Tumor cells ensure sufficient oxygen nutrient supply proliferation lactate-induced secretion VEGF, resulting formation new vessels. summary, accumulation lactate solid tumors pivotal early event development malignancies. determination lactate enter clinical trials confirm relevance cancer biology.
