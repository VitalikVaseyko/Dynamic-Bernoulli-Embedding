 Bulk-prepared neuronal perikarya glial fractions used study developmental changes enzymic activities concerning glycolysis synthesis neurotransmitters. Somewhat higher pyruvate kinase activity found neuronal perikarya glial cells, rapid rise observed early developmental stages. Increased K(+) concentration orD-glutamate addition incubation medium enhanced consumption phosphoenolpyruvate. activation enzyme small birth, increased parallel development adult level, activation glial fractions twice neuronal fractions. Choline acetyltransferase activity found purified neuronal fractions increased age; glutamate decarboxylase also found high activity purified neuronal fractions increased development. However, enzymic activities also found glial fractions, possibilities contamination synaptosomal, myelin, subfractions discussed.
