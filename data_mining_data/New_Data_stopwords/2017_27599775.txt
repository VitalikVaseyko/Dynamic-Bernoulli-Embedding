 differential availability iron hypoxia presumed affect functioning cardiac skeletal myocytes. Rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes L6G8C5 myocytes cultured 48 h normoxic hypoxic conditions optimal, reduced increased iron concentration. mRNA expression levels markers apoptosis [Bcell lymphoma2 (Bcl2; inhibition) Bcl2activated X protein (Bax; induction)], atrophy (Atrogin), glycolysis (pyruvate kinase 2; PKM2) iron metabolism [transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1; iron importer), ferroportin 1 (FPN1; iron exporter), ferritin heavy chain (FTH; iron storage protein) hepcidin (HAMP; iron regulator)] determined using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction, cell viability measured using tetrazolium reduction assay. Cardiomyocytes myocytes, exposed hypoxia, demonstrated increased Bax/Bcl2 gene expression ratio (P<0.05). Additional deferoxamine (DFO) treatment resulted increases Bax/Bcl2 cell type (P<0.001 each) associated 15% loss viability. analogous alterations observed cell types upon ammonium ferric citrate (AFC) treatment hypoxia; however, increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio associated viability loss lower compared case DFO treatment (P<0.05 each). hypoxic conditions, myocytes demonstrated increased expression PKM2 (P<0.01). Additional DFO treatment caused increase mRNA expression levels PKM2 Atrogin1 (P<0.001 P<0.05, respectively), whereas AFC treatment caused increased mRNA expression PKM2 (P<0.01) accompanied decreased mRNA expression Atrogin1 (P<0.05). expression augmentation PKM2 hypoxia greater upon low iron compared ferric salt treatment (P<0.01). cell types upon DFO hypoxia demonstrated increased expression TfR1 HAMP (all P<0.05), associated increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio (all R>0.6 P<0.05). conclusion, hypoxia iron deficiency impairs viability cardiomyocytes myocytes severely compared iron excess. myocytes, hypoxia iron may act protective manner, since level atrophy decreased ironsalttreated cells.
