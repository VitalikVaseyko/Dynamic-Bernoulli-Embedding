 Critically ill patients experience marked skeletal muscle atrophy, molecular mechanisms responsible largely unresolved. Therefore, investigated key genes proteins, identified cell animal studies control protein synthesis breakdown, vastus lateralis biopsy samples obtained 10 patients 10 age- sex-matched healthy controls. Muscle cytokines IL-6 TNF-alpha mRNA higher patients controls(6.5-fold; P < 0.001 2-fold; P < 0.01). perspective muscle protein breakdown, muscle-specific E3-ligases (MAFbx MuRF1) higher patients mRNA (4.5-fold; P < 0.05 2.5-fold; P < 0.05) protein (5-fold; P < 0.001 4.5-fold; P < 0.001) level. Furthermore, 20S proteasome mRNA protein higher patients (5-fold; P < 0.001 2.5-fold; P < 0.01). Cathepsin-L mRNA 2-fold higher (P < 0.01), whilst calpain-3 mRNA(2-fold; P < 0.01) protein (4-fold; P < 0.01)were lower inpatients. Another novel observation 3-fold (P < 0.05) 8.5-fold (P < 0.001) higher expression myostatin mRNA protein patients. Widespread dephosphorylation (inactivation) proteins regulating translation initiation factor activation protein synthesis (Akt1, GSK3alpha,beta, mTOR, p70S6K 4E-BP1) observed patients, paralleled increases mRNAs. Finally, PDK4 mRNA protein 2-fold (P < 0.05) 2.6-fold (P < 0.01), respectively, higher inpatients. conclusion, showed comprehensive alterations molecular events thought reduce muscle mass carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation critically ill patients. Nevertheless,these catabolic events matched cellular programme anabolic restoration transcriptional level. shows high molecular plasticity muscle patients, strategies preserve muscle mass metabolic function focus maintaining Akt phosphorylation inhibiting myostatin expression.C
