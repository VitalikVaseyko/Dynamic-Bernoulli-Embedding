 tumors primarily rely glycolysis rather mitochondrial respiration ATP production. phenomenon, also known Warburg effect, renders tumors sensitive glycolytic disturbances compared normal cells. 3-bromopyruvate potent inhibitor glycolysis shows promise anticancer drug candidate. Although investigations revealed 3-BP triggers apoptosis ATP depletion subsequent AMPK activation, underlying molecular mechanisms coupling AMPK apoptosis poorly understood. showed 3-BP leads rapid ATP depletion followed growth inhibition Bax-dependent apoptosis HCT116 cells. Apoptosis accompanied activation caspase-9 -3 pretreatment general caspase inhibitor attenuated cell death. AMPK, p38, JNK, Akt phosphorylated immediately upon treatment. Pharmacological inhibition silencing AMPK largely inhibited 3-BP-induced apoptosis reversed phosphorylation JNK. Transcriptional activity FoxO3a dramatically increased subsequent AMPK-mediated phosphorylation FoxO3a Ser413. Cell death analysis cells transiently transfected wt AMPK-phosphorylation-deficient FoxO3 expression plasmids verified contributory role AMPK-FoxO3a axis 3-BP-induced apoptosis. addition, expression proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bim Bax upregulated AMPK-dependent manner. Bim transcriptionally activated association FoxO3a activity, Bax upregulation abolished p53-null cells. Together, data suggest AMPK couples 3-BP-induced metabolic disruption intrinsic apoptosis via modulation FoxO3a-Bim axis Bax expression. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
