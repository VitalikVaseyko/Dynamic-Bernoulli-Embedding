 last stages embryonic development crucial turkeys metabolism shifts accommodate posthatch survival growth. better understand metabolic change occurs perinatal period, focused microarray methodology used identify changes expression key genes control metabolism turkey embryos 20 incubation (E) hatch (E28). Gene expression patterns evaluated liver, pectoral muscle, hatching muscle associated measured embryonic growth tissue glycogen concentration. Within studied period, expression 60 genes significantly changed liver, 53 pectoral muscle, 51 hatching muscle. Genes related lipid metabolism (enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, lipoprotein lipase, thyroxine deiodinase) reduced expression E22 E26, corresponding period expected limited oxygen supply. contrast, genes related opposing pathways carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis gluconeogenesis (hexokinases, glucose-6 phosphatase, phosphofructokinases, glucose 1-6 phosphatase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), glycogenesis glycogenolysis (glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase) rather static expression patterns E22 E26, indicating enzymatic activity must posttranscriptional control. Metabolic survey microarray methodology brings new insights avian embryonic development physiology.
