 global health impact malaria enormous, estimated 300-500 million clinical cases 1 million annual deaths. humans, initial susceptibility infection Plasmodium species, disease severity ultimate outcome malaria (self-healing lethal) complex genetic control. Alleles associated sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia deficiency glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase protective effect malaria may retained positive selection areas endemic malaria. Likewise, genetic variations erythrocyte antigens levels host cytokines affect type severity disease. mouse model infection Plasmodium chabaudi used study genetic component malaria susceptibility. Segregation analyses informative F2 crosses derived resistant C57BL/6J susceptible A/J, C3H SJL strains using extent blood stage replication parasite survival traits mapped three P. chabaudi resistance (Char) loci chromosomes 9 (Char1), 8 (Char2) 17 (Char3, MHC-linked). Recombinant congenic strains AcB55 AcB61 unusually resistant malaria despite carrying susceptibility alleles Char1 Char2. Malaria resistance AcB55 AcB61 associated splenomegaly constitutive reticulocytosis, inherited autosomal recessive fashion controlled locus chromosome 3 (Char4). Sequencing candidate genes Char4 region identified loss-of-function mutation (269T-->A, resulting amino acid substitution I90N) pyruvate kinase gene (Pklr) underlies malaria resistance AcB55 AcB61. results suggest pyruvate kinase deficiency may similarly protect humans malaria.
