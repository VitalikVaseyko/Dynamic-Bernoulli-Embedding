 cancers use glucose substrate aerobic glycolysis preference oxidative phosphorylation. However, variable glucose concentrations within in-vivo tumor microenvironment may necessitate metabolic plasticity. Furthermore, little information exists role estrogen receptors modulating possible metabolic adaptations breast cancer cells. find MCF-7 cells switch metabolic pathways depending glucose availability 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) potentiates adaptation. high glucose conditions E(2) up-regulates glycolysis via enhanced AKT kinase activity suppresses tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. decrease extracellular glucose, mitochondrial pathways activated preference glycolysis. setting, E(2) suppresses glycolysis rescues cell viability stimulating tricarboxylic acid cycle via up-regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. E(2) also increases ATP low glucose-cultured cells, novel phosphorylation PDH AMP kinase required metabolic compensations. Capitalizing metabolic vulnerability, knockdown PDH low-glucose state strongly potentiates ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis reverses cell survival effects E(2). propose lowering glucose substrate inhibiting PDH may augment adjuvant therapies estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
