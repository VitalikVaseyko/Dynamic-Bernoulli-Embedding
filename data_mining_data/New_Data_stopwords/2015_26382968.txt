 review, revisit metabolic shift respiration glycolysis lymphocytes upon activation, known Warburg effect tumour cells. compare situation lymphocytes several cell types, muscle cells, Kupffer cells, microglia cells, astrocytes, stem cells, tumour cells various unicellular organisms (e.g. yeasts). critically discuss compare several explanations put forward literature observation proliferating cells adopt apparently less efficient pathway: hypoxia, poisoning competitors end products, higher ATP production rate, higher precursor supply, regulatory effects, avoiding harmful effects (e.g. reactive oxygen species). conclude case lymphocytes, increased ATP production rate precursor supply main advantages upregulating glycolysis.
