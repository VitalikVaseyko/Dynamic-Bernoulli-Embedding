 present paper, examined effects natural cyclopeptide RA-V human breast cancer cells underlying mechanisms. RA-V significantly inhibited growth human breast cancer MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells murine breast cancer 4T1 cells. addition, RA-V triggered mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indicated loss mitochondrial membrane potential, release cytochrome c, activation caspase cascade. study showed RA-V dramatically inhibited phosphorylation AKT 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) MCF-7 cells. Moreover, RA-V disrupted interaction PDK1 AKT MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, RA-V-induced apoptosis could enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor attenuated over-expression AKT three kinds breast cancer cells. Taken together, study shows RA-V, induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, exerts strong anti-tumor activity human breast cancer. underlying anti-cancer mechanism RA-V related blockage interaction PDK1 AKT.
