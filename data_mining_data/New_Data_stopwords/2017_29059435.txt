 mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) irreversibly decarboxylates pyruvate acetyl coenzyme A, thereby linking glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle defining critical step cellular bioenergetics. Inhibition PDC activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated phosphorylation associated pathobiology many disorders metabolic integration, including cancer. Consequently, PDC/PDK axis long therapeutic target. common underlying mechanism accounting PDC inhibition conditions post-transcriptional upregulation one PDK isoforms, leading phosphorylation E1alpha subunit PDC. perturbations PDC/PDK axis induce "glycolytic shift," whereby affected cells favor adenosine triphosphate production glycolysis mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation cellular proliferation cellular quiescence. Dichloroacetate prototypic xenobiotic inhibitor PDK, thereby maintaining PDC unphosphorylated, catalytically active form. However, recent interest therapeutic targeting PDC/PDK axis treatment cancer yielded new generation small molecule PDK inhibitors. Ongoing investigations central role PDC cellular energy metabolism regulation pharmacological effectors PDKs promise open multiple exciting vistas biochemical understanding treatment cancer diseases.
