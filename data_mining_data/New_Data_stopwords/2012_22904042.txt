 pyridine nucleotides NAD(+) NADP(+) play pivotal role regulating intermediary metabolism heart. intracellular NAD(+)/NADH ratio controls flux various dehydrogenase enzymes involved anaerobic aerobic metabolism also regulates posttranslational protein modification. intracellular NADP(+)/NADPH ratio controls flux pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) polyol pathway, also regulating ion channel function oxidative stress. NAD(+)/NADH ratio regulate rates ATP production, also modify energy substrate preference. instance, many forms heart disease greater contribution fatty acids oxidative energy metabolism increases fatty acid beta-oxidation-derived NADH, activate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase isoforms inhibit PDH subsequent glucose oxidation. such, novel therapies overcome fatty acid beta-oxidation-induced inhibition PDH improve cardiac efficiency subsequent function ischemia/reperfusion heart failure. Furthermore, recent studies implicated pivotal role increased PPP-derived NADPH mediating oxidative stress observed heart failure. article, review multiple actions NAD(+)/NADH NADP(+)/NADPH regulating intermediary metabolism heart. better understanding roles NAD(+)/NADH NADP(+)/NADPH cellular physiology pathology could potentially used exploit pyridine nucleotide modification treatment number different forms heart disease.
