 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), key enzyme implicated metabolic reprogramming tumors, induced several tumors including glioblastoma, breast cancer melanoma. However, role played PDK1 studied retinoblastoma (RB). study, evaluated expression PDK1 RB clinical samples, studied inhibition strategy decrease cell growth migration. show PDK1 specifically overexpressed RB patient samples especially vitreous seeds hypoxic regions cell lines compared control retina using immunohistochemistry real-time PCR. results demonstrate inhibition PDK1 using small molecule inhibitors dichloroacetic acid (DCA) dichloroacetophenone (DAP) resulted reduced cell growth increased apoptosis. also confirm combination treatment DCA chemotherapeutic agent carboplatin enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared single drug treatment. addition, observed changes glucose uptake, lactate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels well decreased cell migration response PDK1 inhibition. Additionally, show DCA treatment led inhibition PI3K/Akt pathway reduction PDK1 protein levels. Overall, data suggest targeting PDK1 could novel therapeutic strategy RB.
