 fraction glucose metabolized lactate dramatically reduced erythroid differentiation mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells induced dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), sodium butyrate treatment. order determine mechanism reduction lactate production, several enzymatic steps glucose catabolism investigated. changes glycolytic enzyme levels found differentiation could account alteration lactate production alterations pyruvate kinase activity known occur MEL cell differentiation. Further, utilizing D-mannoheptulose, specific inhibitor hepatic-/tumor-specific glucokinase, dependence activity enzyme growth differentiation observed. Therefore, possibility entertained decrease lactate production reflected decrease fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P-2) major regulator lactate production due ability allosterically stimulate phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) activity. PFK-1 cannot function absence F-2,6-P-2 suboptimal concentration one substrates, fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P), present. assayed limiting F-6-P concentrations, found following DMSO- HMBA-induced differentiation, PFK-1 activity decreased 7-20-fold. finding suggested F-2,6-P-2 levels might controlling lactate production system. keeping idea, marked decreases F-2,6-P-2 levels found occur DMSO- HMBA-induced differentiation. data suggest decreasing F-2,6-P-2 levels account decrease lactate accumulation occurs MEL cell differentiation.
