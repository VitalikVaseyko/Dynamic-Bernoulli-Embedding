 Using (13)C-labeled glucose fed facultative alkalophilic Bacillus clausii producing alkaline serine protease Savinase, intracellular fluxes quantified continuous cultivation batch cultivation minimal medium. flux pentose phosphate pathway found increase increasing specific growth rate much lower level previously reported Bacillus subtilis. Two futile cycles pyruvate metabolism included metabolic network. substantial flux futile cycle involving malic enzyme estimated, whereas small zero flux PEP carboxykinase estimated, indicating latter enzyme active growth glucose. uptake amino acids semirich medium containing 15 20 amino acids normally present proteins estimated using fully labeled glucose batch cultivations. found leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine taken medium synthesized de novo glucose. contrast, serine threonine completely synthesized metabolites taken medium. Valine, proline, lysine partly taken medium partly synthesized glucose. metabolic network analysis extended include analysis growth semirich medium containing amino acids, metabolic flux distribution medium estimated compared growth minimal medium.
