 Vitamin E activity sesame seed, contains gamma-tocopherol, compound vitamin E activity equal 6-16% alpha-tocopherol, examined two experiments. first experiment, groups rats fed four diets: vitamin E-free control diet, alpha-tocopherol-containing diet, gamma-tocopherol-containing diet sesame seed-containing diet. Changes red blood cell hemolysis, plasma pyruvate kinase activity, peroxides plasma liver, indices vitamin E activity, examined. sesame seed diet high vitamin E activity, whereas activity low gamma-tocopherol diet. plasma liver, alpha-tocopherol found high concentration alpha-tocopherol-fed group, gamma-tocopherol found high concentration sesame seed-fed group, negligible amounts gamma-tocopherol liver gamma-tocopherol-fed group. second experiment, two diets containing sesame lignan (sesaminol sesamin) gamma-tocopherol tested. Results sesame lignan-fed groups comparable observed sesame seed-fed group Experiment 1. experiments indicate gamma-tocopherol sesame seed exerts vitamin E activity equal alpha-tocopherol synergistic interaction sesame seed lignans.
