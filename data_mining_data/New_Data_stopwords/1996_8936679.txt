 Nongenomic actions thyroid hormone definition independent nuclear receptors hormone described plasma membrane, various cell organelles, cytoskeleton, cytoplasm. actions include alterations solute transport (Ca2+, Na+, glucose), changes activities several kinases, including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), effects efficiency specific mRNA translation mRNA t1/2, modulation mitochondrial respiration, regulation actin polymerization (promotion formation F-actin). Iodothyronines also regulate nongenomically state contractile elements vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). physiologic significance cellular level certain actions demonstrated, example, cases myocardiocyte Na+ current, red cell Ca2+ content, control hormone-induced alterations actin solubility cell surface activity iodothyronine 5'-monodeiodinase activity intracellular distribution protein disulfide isomerase activity. physiologic significance actions organ system level less clear, extranuclear effects thyroid hormone myocardial Na+ channel, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, contractile state VSMC may contribute acute effects thyroid hormone cardiac output recently described clinically. molecular mechanisms nongenomic actions incompletely understood; relevant binding sites signal transduction pathways described hormone actions plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, PKM2 monomer known bind T3 and, result, prevent activation kinase via tetramer formation. Nongenomic actions thyroid hormone may different structure-activity relationships iodothyronines effects depend upon nuclear receptors; may different time courses may invoke complex signal transduction pathways action detected.
