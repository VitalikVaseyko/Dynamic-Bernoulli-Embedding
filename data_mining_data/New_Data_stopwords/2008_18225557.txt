 Recently link A-Raf cellular energy homeostasis synthetic pathways suggested identification pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK), key glycolytic enzyme, interaction partner A-Raf study, demonstrated A-Raf important regulator M2-PK function. primary mouse fibroblasts, characterized glutamine production serine degradation, A-Raf induced dimerization inactivation M2-PK, thereby reducing conversion rates glucose lactate. immortalized NIH3T3 fibroblasts, showing glutamine degradation serine production, oncogenic A-Raf increased highly active tetrameric form M2-PK favored glycolytic energy production. High serine levels thus may responsible activation M2-PK A-Raf transformed NIH3T3 cells.
