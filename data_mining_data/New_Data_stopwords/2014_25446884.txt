 recently discovered Warburg effect, defined dramatically enhanced metabolism glucose pyruvate, even well-oxygenated cancer cells, occur consequence mutations enhance lipid biosynthesis expense respiratory capacity. Specifically, mutations E1 subunit either two respiratory enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC) alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDC), change substrate specificity 3-carbon alpha-ketoacid pyruvate, 5-carbon alpha-ketoacid alpha-ketoglutarate, 4-carbon alpha-ketoacid oxaloacetate (OADC). mutations result OADC-catalyzed synthesis malonyl-CoA (MaCoA), essential precursor fatty acids. mutants arose spontaneous suppressors yeast acc1(cs) cold-sensitive mutation encoding altered form AcCoA carboxylase (Acc1) fails produce MaCoA restrictive temperature (16 degrees C). Notably, suppressors respiratory defective result nuclear mutations suppress acc1(cs). mutants also suppress sensitivity Soraphen A, potent inhibitor Acc1 activity, normal temperature (30 degrees C). knowledge, OADC activity never identified eukaryotic cells. results offer novel perspective Warburg effect: reprogramming energy metabolism cancer cells consequence mutational impairment respiration meet fatty acid requirements rapidly proliferating cells. suggest OADC activity common feature cancer cells represents novel target development chemotherapeutics.
