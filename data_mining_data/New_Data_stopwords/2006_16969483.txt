 Stomach cancer still major cause death Asian people despite complete cure resection early cancers, mainly peritoneal dissemination difficult treat. present study, used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) identify specific proteins differentially expressed highly metastatic stomach cancer cell line MKN-45-P parental cell line MKN-45. detected 27 protein spots least 2 3 experiments showed statistically significant differences abundance. 27 protein spots identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) database-searching software. proteomic analysis revealed 13 different proteins isoforms sharing different biochemical characteristics, 8 proteins up-regulated, 5 down-regulated. 13 proteins mainly involved protein synthesis (transfer RNA synthetase), metabolism (flavoprotein subunit, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase), receptor signal transduction (annexins A2), cytoskeleton (keratin 5, cytokeratin 8) cell cycling (ts11). results suggested proteomic approach including 2-D DIGE would efficient way identify proteins responsible specific biological functions. Moreover, observations might novel findings leading prediction postoperative peritoneal recurrence.
