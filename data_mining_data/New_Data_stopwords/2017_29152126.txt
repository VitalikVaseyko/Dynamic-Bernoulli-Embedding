 Cancer cells able uptake extracellular ATP (eATP) via macropinocytosis elevate intracellular ATP (iATP) levels, enhancing survival drug treatment. However, involved drug resistance mechanisms unknown. investigated roles eATP either energy phosphorylating molecule general drug resistance mediated ATP internalization iATP elevation. report eATP increased iATP levels promoted drug resistance various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) chemo-drugs human cancer cell lines five cancer types. A549 lung cancer cells, resistance downregulated macropinocytosis inhibition siRNA knockdown PAK1, essential macropinocytosis enzyme. elevated iATP upregulated efflux activity ABC transporters A549 SK-Hep-1 cells well phosphorylation PDGFRalpha proteins PDGFR-mediated Akt-mTOR Raf-MEK signaling pathways A549 cells. Similar phosphorylation upregulations found A549 tumors. results demonstrate eATP induces different types drug resistance eATP internalization iATP elevation, implicating ATP-rich tumor microenvironment cancer drug resistance, expanding understanding roles eATP Warburg effect offering new anticancer drug resistance targets.
