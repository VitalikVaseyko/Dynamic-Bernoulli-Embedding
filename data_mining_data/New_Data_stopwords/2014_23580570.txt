 selective pressures leading cancers mutations KRAS PIK3CA unclear. Here, show somatic cell knockin KRAS G12V oncogenic PIK3CA mutations human breast epithelial cells results cooperative activation phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways vitro, leads tumor formation immunocompromised mice. Xenografts double-knockin cells retain single copies mutant KRAS PIK3CA, suggesting tumor formation require increased copy number either oncogene, results also observed human colorectal cancer specimens. Mechanistically, cooperativity mutant KRAS PIK3CA mediated part Ras/p110alpha binding, inactivating point mutations within Ras-binding domain PIK3CA significantly abates pathway signaling. addition, Pdk1 activation downstream effector p90RSK also increased combined presence mutant KRAS PIK3CA. results provide new insights mutant KRAS function role carcinogenesis.
