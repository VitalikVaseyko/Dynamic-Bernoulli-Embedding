 Dietary restriction increases life span wide range species, including nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. mechanism remains largely unknown, although commonly thought reduction reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays pivotal role. specifically, C. elegans, proposed food restriction reduces energy expenditure, possibly conjunction anaerobic shift energy production, consequent reduction formation ROS. measured differential transcript abundance 49 genes known play roles energy metabolism axenic culture medium, causes nutritional deficit leads substantial increase life span. found evidence reduction metabolic rate shift anaerobic metabolism axenic culture. Major changes induced growth axenic medium include down-regulation lipid degradation up-regulation glyoxylate cycle activity glyceroneogenesis and, possibly, gluconeogenesis. activities determined worm extracts pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase isocitrate lyase followed similar trend. conclude growth axenic culture marked general up-regulation replenishing pathways.
