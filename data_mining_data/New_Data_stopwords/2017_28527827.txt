 Chitin second abundant organic compound planet thus regarded alternative resource petroleum feedstocks. One key challenges biological conversion biomass-derived polysaccharides, cellulose chitin, close gap optimum temperatures enzymatic saccharification microbial fermentation implement single bioreactor. address issue, present study, aimed perform vitro, one-pot bioconversion chitin pyruvate, precursor wide range useful metabolites. Twelve thermophilic enzymes, including NAD(+) regeneration, heterologously produced Escherichia coli semi-purified heat treatment crude extract recombinant cells. experimentally decided concentrations enzymes incubated 0.5 mg mL(-1) colloidal chitin (equivalent 2.5 mM N-acetylglucosamine unit) adequate set cofactors 70 degrees C, 0.62 mM pyruvate produced 5 h. Despite use cofactor-balanced pathway, determination pool sizes cofactors showed rapid decrease ATP concentration, probably due thermally stable ATP-degrading enzyme(s) derived host cell. Integration additional enzyme set thermophilic adenylate kinase polyphosphate kinase led deceleration ATP degradation, final product titer improved 2.1 mM.
