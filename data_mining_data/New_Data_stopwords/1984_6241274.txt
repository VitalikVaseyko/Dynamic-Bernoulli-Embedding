 study metabolic regulation, frequently useful consider degree enzyme influence rate pathway. productive expression rate-controlling influence fractional change pathway rate per fractional change enzyme activity (called control strength sensitivity coefficient). developed system considering substrate-cycle enzyme's control strength depends flux reaction order related features enzymes pathway. applied system gluconeogenic pathway rat liver glycolytic pathway bovine sperm, enough fluxes reaction orders published allow valid estimates several control strengths. normal fed animals gluconeogenesis slow unidirectional substrate-to-product product-to-substrate fluxes comparable, substrate-cycle limbs high similar control strengths regardless flux rates positions pathway. activity step affects substrate-cycle control strengths similarly affects unidirectional end-to-end fluxes relative net rate. Control strengths non-substrate-cycle enzymes negligible compared substrate cycles. fasting animals, hand, unidirectional Pyr----Glc flux much greater Glc----Pyr flux, upstream enzymes (near Pyr) regulatory advantage downstream enzymes (near Glc). circumstance, control strength substrate-cycle enzyme inversely related rate limitingness substrate pathway substrate. Pyr/PEP cycle significantly rate limiting, control strength Pyr----PEP limb much greater pyruvate kinase downstream enzymes. glycolytic pathway bovine sperm, strong product inhibition hexokinase detracts greatly rate limitingness control strength, small despite position beginning pathway large free energy. glucose-transport-hexokinase segment rate limiting, phosphofructo 1-kinase almost much control strength would first enzyme pathway, F6P/FDP cycle moderately rate limiting, Fru-1,6-P2ase enzymes downstream substantial control strengths. glycolysis accelerated stimulation phosphofructo 1-kinase, control strength shifts phosphofructo-1-kinase downstream enzymes transporthesokinase segment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
