 shown previously glucose-induced insulin release completely absent rat pancreatic islets cultured 1 day low glucose (1 mM) restored culturing islets 2nd day high (20 mM) glucose (MacDonald, M. J., Fahien, L. A., McKenzie, D. I., Moran, S. M. (1991) Am. J. Physiol. 259, E548-E554). suggested incapacitation glucose's insulinotropism due down-regulation synthesis enzymes process glucose's metabolic signal insulin release. current study, results metabolic, enzymic, molecular biologic experiments consistent (an) intramitochondrial site(s) down-regulation islets cultured low glucose. Glucose metabolism inhibited 80% islets cultured 1 mM glucose. suppression release 14CO2 [6-14C]glucose greater [U-14C]glucose greater [3,4-14C]glucose greater [1-14C]glucose islets cultured low glucose indicated mitochondrial site down-regulation C-6 glucose converted CO2 citric acid cycle, whereas C-1 released CO2 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [corrected] reaction, C-6 glucose dwells citric acid cycle longer carbons 2-5 glucose. Since carbons 3 4 glucose decarboxylated pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, incomplete suppression CO2 formation carbons consistent suppression pyruvate carboxylation well decarboxylation. Formation 3HOH [5-3H]glucose equal two groups islets, indicating glycolysis far phosphoenolpyruvate intact. idea supported assays showed activities enzymes glycolytic pathway glucokinase/hexokinase pyruvate kinase equal types islets. Additional studies indicated regulation glucose transcription genes coding mitochondrial enzymes. Glucokinase, malic enzyme, fumarase mRNAs affected glucose, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit pyruvate carboxylase mRNAs decreased 85-90% islets cultured 1 mM glucose. Pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity decreased similar extent islets. 24 h required maximal (de)induction pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha pyruvate carboxylase mRNAs, amounts transcripts proportional concentrations glucose 1 20 mM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
