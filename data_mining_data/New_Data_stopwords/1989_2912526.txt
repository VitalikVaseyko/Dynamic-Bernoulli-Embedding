 compared pyruvate kinase (PK) isoenzyme pattern three rhabdomyosarcomas foetal skeletal muscle tissue 19 23 weeks gestation, together adult muscle relation immunohistochemical morphological criteria. foetal tissue 19 weeks gestation focal immunopositivity desmin myoglobin observed, whereas tissue 23 weeks overall positivity proteins present. Two three neoplasms poorly differentiated alveolar subtype. desmin immunoreactive. large spindle-shaped cells expressed myoglobin. third one differentiated microscopic characteristics cells showed immunoreactivity desmin myoglobin. foetal tissues five forms pyruvate kinase isoenzymes present K2M2 predominant form. adult muscle tissue M4 present. tumors characterized profound shift K-type, whereas M4-type expressed all. difference isoenzyme composition pyruvate kinase found morphologically less differentiated tumors differentiated tumor; latter M-subunits expressed.
