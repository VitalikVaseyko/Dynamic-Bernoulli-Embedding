 tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle plays two essential roles metabolism. First, aerobic conditions cycle responsible total oxidation acetyl-CoA derived mainly pyruvate produced glycolysis. Second, TCA cycle intermediates required biosynthesis several amino acids. Although TCA cycle long considered "housekeeping" pathway Escherichia coli Salmonella enterica, pathway highly regulated transcriptional level. Much control exerted response respiratory conditions. TCA cycle gene-protein relationship mutant phenotypes well studied, although loose ends remain. realization "shadow" TCA cycle exists proceeds methylcitrate cleared prior ambiguities. glyoxylate bypass long known essential growth carbon sources acetate fatty acids pathway allowsnet conversion acetyl-CoA metabolic intermediates. Strains lacking pathway fail grow carbon sources, since acetate carbon entering TCA cycle quantitatively lost CO2 resulting lack means replenish dicarboxylic acids consumed amino acid biosynthesis. TCA cycle gene-protein relationship mutant phenotypes well studied, although identity small molecule ligand modulates transcriptional control glyoxylate cycle genes binding IclR repressor remains unknown. activity cycle also exerted enzyme level reversible phosphorylation TCA cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzed specific kinase/phosphatase allow isocitratelyase compete isocitrate cleave intermediate glyoxylate succinate.
