 need research studies molecular mechanisms underpinning link polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) endometrial cancer (EC) facilitate screening encourage development novel strategies prevent disease progression. objective review identify proteomic biomarkers EC risk women PCOS. eligible published studies proteomic biomarkers EC identified literature evaluated. Proteomic biomarkers EC integrated updated previously published database proteomic biomarkers identified far PCOS women. Nine protein biomarkers similarly either expressed women EC PCOS various tissues. include transgelin, pyruvate kinase M1/M2, gelsolin-like capping protein (macrophage capping protein), glutathione S-transferase P, leucine aminopeptidase (cytosol aminopeptidase), peptidyl-prolyl cis-transisomerase, cyclophilin A, complement component C4A manganese-superoxide dismutase. validated, biomarkers may provide useful framework knowledge base area could developed facilitate future mathematical modelling enhance screening prevention EC women PCOS shown increased risk.
