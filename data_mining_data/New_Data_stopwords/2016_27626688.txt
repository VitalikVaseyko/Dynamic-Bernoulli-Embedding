 Radiotherapy generally applied treatment esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, radioresistance ESCC still remains obstacle curative effect treatment. hypothesized diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), might enhance radiosensitizationin resistant ESCC. clonogenic survival assay revealed DADA sensitized ESCC cells radiotherapy vitro; furthermore, combination DADA radiotherapy increased expression gamma-H2AX, hallmark DNA double-strand breaks. Arrest G2/M phase well induction apoptosis ESCC cells also observed cells treated combination DADA radiotherapy. Notably, xenograft tumor growth significantly suppressed vivo combined radiotherapy DADA administration. proven glycolysis highly correlated radioresistance, could reversed shift glycolysis mitochondrial oxidation. present study, found DADA could modulate oxidative phosphorylation well increase intracellular levels reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, concluded DADA-induced intracellular ROS accumulation identified key factor radiotherapy sensitization ESCC.
