 Diabetes mellitus serious chronic metabolic disorder. develop novel anti-diabetic drugs nature sources always focus research. Red deer (Cervus elaphu Linnaeus) antler one famous Chinese traditional medicines. found peptides 5-10 kDa red deer antlers (PRDA) promoted growth cultured rat islet cells. purpose study investigate anti-diabetic actions PRDA vivo purify pure active peptide. therefore investigated hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic antioxidant effects PRDA streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice isolated pure anti-diabetic peptide. PRDA, given intraperitoneally (75, 150, 300 mug/kg), significantly decreased blood glucose levels, significantly increased insulin concentrations, remarkably improved lipid metabolism diabetic mice. PRDA significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity, catalase activity total antioxidant capacity serum liver, simultaneously decreased malondialdehyde levels. activities hexokinase pyruvate kinase, two important enzymes involved glucose utilization, also significantly increased liver PRDA-treated diabetic mice. Moreover, novel anti-diabetic peptide isolated PRDA significantly promoted viability cultured rat insulinoma cells. molecular mass purified peptide 7064.8 Da mass spectrometry, N-terminal amino acid sequence identified LSPFTTKTYFPHFDLSHGSA. Thus, PRDA may useful managing hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress diabetes, anti-diabetic peptide promising drug treatment diabetes.
