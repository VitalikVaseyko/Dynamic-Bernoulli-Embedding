 considered results early works authors, assumption developed using modern knowledge made possible propose concept Warburg effect mechanism cancer metabolism. concept accents high prevalence anabolic processes cancer metabolism, taking account oncogene operation. explanation Warburg effect mechanism alone provided considering mechanism energy shift anabolic pathway cancer development. basis previous experiments, concept also detected point bifurcation pathways anabolic catabolic processes, made possible ascertain consumption acetyl-CoA anabolic processes lack acetyl-CoA catabolic processes. Thus, results authors' experiments explained using proposed concept. mechanism surviving cancer cells (apoptosis resistance) also explained using concept. addition using Theorell formula proposed concept, explanation also given physical chemistry point view mechanism phenomenon regarding absence contact inhibition proliferating cells malignant tumors. Thus, made possible explain cancer phenomena mechanisms, including metastasis, nonhealing ulcers, irrepressible growth mechanisms. addition, concept made possible also explain experimental results early modern authors could explain. Lastly, distinction mechanisms Pasteur effect Warburg effect explained using proposed concept.
