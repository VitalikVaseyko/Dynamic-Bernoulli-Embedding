 OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) emerged important metabolic regulator glucose lipid metabolism. aims current study evaluate role FGF21 energy metabolism provide mechanistic insights glucose lipid-lowering effects high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) model. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: DIO normal lean mice treated vehicle recombinant murine FGF21. Metabolic parameters including body weight, glucose, lipid levels monitored, hepatic gene expression analyzed. Energy metabolism insulin sensitivity assessed using indirect calorimetry hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp techniques. RESULTS: FGF21 dose dependently reduced body weight whole-body fat mass DIO mice due marked increases total energy expenditure physical activity levels. FGF21 also reduced blood glucose, insulin, lipid levels reversed hepatic steatosis. profound reduction hepatic triglyceride levels associated FGF21 inhibition nuclear sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 expression wide array genes involved fatty acid triglyceride synthesis. FGF21 also dramatically improved hepatic peripheral insulin sensitivity lean DIO mice independently reduction body weight adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: FGF21 corrects multiple metabolic disorders DIO mice potential become powerful therapeutic treat hepatic steatosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes.
