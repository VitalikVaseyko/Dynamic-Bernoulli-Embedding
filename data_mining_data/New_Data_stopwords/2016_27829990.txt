 purpose present study assess ocular surface health status primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients switching topical application preserved latanoprost (LT) preservative-free tafluprost (PFT) tear proteomic monitoring. Tear fluid POAG patients showing dry eye symptoms, using LT switching PFT well tear fluid healthy controls examined. Tear proteome dynamics monitored 24 weeks first mass spectrometric explorative analysis small POAG patient cohort (N = 3). Longitudinal responses candidate proteins well cytokines comparatively analyzed microarray larger cohort POAG patients (N = 16) healthy controls (N = 15). Clinical parameters including tear breakup time (TBUT) basal Schirmer test (BST) recorded. Distinct post-switch level alterations could documented POAG tear proteins (> 1000). Cellular leakage proteins, dry eye related candidates cytokines showed predominantly level diminishment POAG patients approximation tear protein level healthy controls response PFT. Tear proteins like pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 galectin 7 displayed linear tear film level decline POAG patients (R(2)>/=0.9; P < 0.05) distinctly converging healthy level. Proteomic outcome fit well improved clinical parameters, TBUT BST. conclusion, tear proteomic alterations indicated ocular surface recovery regarding epithelia leakage inflammation recession. Together improved clinical parameters study output proposes beneficial effects PFT glaucoma therapy.
