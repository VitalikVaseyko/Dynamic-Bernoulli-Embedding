 aim study test whether transient inhibition glucose uptake could precondition rabbit heart. Rabbit hearts experienced 30 min regional ischemia followed either 120 min (isolated heart protocol) 180 min (in situ protocol) reperfusion. Infarct size determined tetrazolium staining. isolated heart experiments, 15 min perfusion glucose-free Krebs buffer starting 30 min prior ischemia significantly limited infarct size 9.9 +/- 2.6% risk zone compared 29.4 +/- 1.7% infarction controls. protection could blocked (30.8 +/- 3.4%) polymyxin B (50 microM), protein kinase C inhibitor, 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline, adenosine receptor inhibitor, suggesting mechanism similar ischemic preconditioning without involvement adenosine receptors. Pyruvate acetate inhibit glucose uptake without incurring metabolic deficit. 20 mM pyruvate 1 mM acetate added glucose-containing buffer 15 min prior ischemia, protection evident (12.0 +/- 3.0% 10.0 +/- 3.7% infarction, respectively). However, acetate (1 mM) present perfusate throughout experiment, neither omission glucose addition pyruvate caused protection (26.1 +/- 2.2% 28.9 +/- 4.7% infarction, respectively). Furthermore, situ hearts preferably utilize lipid substrates treated pyruvate (2 g/kg i.v. 20 min ischemia), infarct size 40.3 +/- 3.0%, differ untreated hearts (38.6 +/- 3.2%). Hence transient inhibition glucose uptake precondition heart, substrates utilized preference glucose absent.
