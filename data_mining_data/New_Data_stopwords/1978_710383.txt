 Despite presence marked decrease liver protein content 48 h single injection D-galactosamine, increased activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, low-Km hexokinase pyruvate kinase type M2 observed injured liver. Microsomal aniline hydroxylase activity cytochrome P-450 content liver decreased significantly 48 h galactosamine treatment first 2 h contrast carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) intoxication. extents changes great CCl4-treated rats. disaggreation polyribosomes liver observed 24 h galactosamine treatment. However, formation microsomal lipoperoxidation increase entire course acute liver injury amino sugar. results taken together previous observations indicate dysregulation protein synthesis essential biochemical event hepatocyte injury induced treatment rats galactosamine well CCl4.
