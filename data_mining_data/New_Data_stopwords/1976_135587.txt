 patient unclassified form acquired dyserythropoiesis found multiple defects erythrocyte enzyme activity, involving especially pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), phosphofructokinase (PFK). PK activity defect associated normal concentration PK-related antigen, enzyme could reactivated procedure partial purification enzyme. concentration GPI-related antigen reduced GPI enzymatic activity, defect improved treatment (cross-incubation red cells treatment hemolysate SH reagents); residual enzyme normal stability heat, normal electrophoretic electrofocusing pattern. PFK activity defect improved either cross-incubation red cells treatment SH reagents. Immunologic data antimuscle antileukocyte antisera seemed indicate defect involved especially muscle-type subunit erythrocyte PFK. agreement assumption fact deficient PFK markedly inhibited ATP normal enzyme. Changes similar deficient PFK herein studied noted PFK unfractionated erythrocytes premature newborns "old" erythrocytes full-term infants. appeared three enzyme defects detected patient could due different mechanism, involving post-translational changes, decreased synthesis, possible reversion genetic regulation mechanisms abnormal erythroid precursors toward fetal type. possible relationships various phenomena nature hypothetical common underlying cause discussed.
