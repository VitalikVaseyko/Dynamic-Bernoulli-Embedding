 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK), negative regulator mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (mtPDC), plays pivotal role controlling mtPDC activity, hence, TCA cycle cell respiration. report describes cloning pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase cDNA (AtPDHK) Arabidopsis thaliana focuses effects antisense down-regulation expression plant growth development. deduced amino acid sequence AtPDHK exhibits extensive similarity plant mammalian PDHKs, containing conserved domains typical two-component histidine protein kinases. Escherichia coli expressed AtPDHK specifically phosphorylated mammalian PDH E1 time-dependent manner. Antisense expression AtPDHK cDNA led marked elevation mtPDC activity transgenic plants increases ranging 137% 330% compared control plants. Immunoblot analyses performed monoclonal antibody E1alpha mtPDH component (the subunit phosphorylated PDHK) indicated increased mtPDC activity result increase level PDH protein. MtPDC transgenic plants showed reduced sensitivity ATP-dependent inactivation compared observed wild-type plants. Collectively, data suggest antisense partial silencing negative regulator, PDHK, responsible increased mtPDC activity observed antisense PDHK plants. Transgenic plants partially repressed AtPDHK also displayed altered vegetative growth reduced accumulation vegetative tissues, early flower development shorter generation time. potential role AtPDHK gene manipulation crop improvement discussed.
