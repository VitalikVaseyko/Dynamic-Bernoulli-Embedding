 mechanism implicated differentiation endogenous cardiac stem cells cardiomyocytes regenerate heart tissue upon insult remains elusive, limiting therapeutical goals exogenous cell injection and/or gene therapy. shown previously cardiac specific overexpression insulin-like growth factor 1 propeptide IGF-1Ea induces beneficial myocardial repair infarct. Although mechanism still investigation, possibility propeptide may involved promoting stem cell differentiation cardiac lineage yet explored. investigate whether IGF-1Ea promote cardiogenesis, initially modified P19 embryonal carcinoma cells express IGF-1Ea. Taking advantage cardiomyogenic nature, analyzed whether overexpression propeptide affected cardiac differentiation program. data herein presented showed first time constitutively overexpressed IGF-1Ea increased cardiogenic differentiation program undifferentiated DMSO-differentiated cells. details, IGF-1Ea overexpression promoted localization alpha-actinin finely organized sarcomeric structure compared control cells upregulated cardiac mesodermal marker NKX-2.5 ventricular structural protein MLC2v. Furthermore, activated IGF-1 signaling promoted cardiac mesodermal induction undifferentiated cells independently cell proliferation. analysis suggests IGF-1Ea may good candidate improve vitro production cardiomyocytes pluripotent stem cells vivo activation differentiation program cardiac progenitor cells.
