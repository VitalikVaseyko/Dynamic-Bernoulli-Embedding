 Recent studies revealed newly emerging transformed cells often apically extruded epithelial tissues. process, normal epithelial cells recognize actively eliminate transformed cells, process called epithelial defence cancer (EDAC). Here, show mitochondrial membrane potential diminished RasV12-transformed cells surrounded normal cells. addition, glucose uptake elevated, leading higher lactate production. mitochondrial dysfunction driven upregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), positively regulates elimination RasV12-transformed cells. Furthermore, EDAC surrounding normal cells, involving filamin, drives Warburg-effect-like metabolic alteration. Moreover, using cell-competition mouse model, demonstrate PDK-mediated metabolic changes promote elimination RasV12-transformed cells intestinal epithelia. data indicate non-cell-autonomous metabolic modulation crucial regulator cell competition, shedding light unexplored events initial stage carcinogenesis.
