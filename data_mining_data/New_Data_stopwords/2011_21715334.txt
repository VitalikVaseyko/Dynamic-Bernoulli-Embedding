 Conformational changes acutely control protein kinase C (PKC). previously shown autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate must removed active site order 1) PKC phosphorylated upstream kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1), 2) mature enzyme bind phosphorylate substrates, 3) mature enzyme dephosphorylated phosphatases. show additional level conformational control; binding active site inhibitors locks PKC conformation priming phosphorylation sites resistant dephosphorylation. Using homogeneously pure PKC, show active site inhibitor Go 6983 prevents dephosphorylation pure protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) hydrophobic motif phosphatase, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP). Consistent results using pure proteins, treatment cells competitive inhibitors Go 6983 bisindolylmaleimide I, uncompetitive inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide IV, prevents dephosphorylation down-regulation PKC induced phorbol esters. Pulse-chase analyses reveal active site inhibitors affect net rate priming phosphorylations PKC; rather, inhibit dephosphorylation triggered phorbol esters. data provide molecular explanation recent studies showing active site inhibitors stabilize phosphorylation state protein kinases B/Akt C.
