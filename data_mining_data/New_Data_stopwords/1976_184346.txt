 detection enzyme deficiencies glycolytic nucleotide metabolism human red blood cells enriched pathophysiological knowledge origin nonspherocytic hemolytic anemias (NSHA). far 11 13 glycolytic enzymes deficiencies described connected alterations biochemical enzymatic properties. frequent enzyme deficiencies GPI PK. performance special electrophoretic techniques genetic studies allow demonstration homozygote double heterozygote defect carriers. adenylate kinase pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase deficiencies detected genetically determined altered nucleotide metabolism. metabolic alterations several enzymopathies characterized well, pathophysiological relations enzyme deficiency NSHA probably found sufficient explanation.
