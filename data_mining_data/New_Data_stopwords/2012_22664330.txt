 Contrary conventional belief, mitochondria cancer cells usually function normally, i.e., respiratory capacity fundamentally impaired compared normal cells. Strong evidence misconception mitochondrial dysfunction provided vivo data clearly showing O(2) availability major determinant O(2) consumption rate cancer cells, independent means increasing availability (e.g., increasing blood flow elevating arterial O(2) content, latter accomplished either increase hemoglobin level and/or arterial hyperoxia). Additional support Warburg effect original concept comes normal temperature coefficients (Q(10)) O(2) consumption rates malignant cells. Thus, Warburg hypothesis postulating mitochondrial dysfunction cancer cells forces generate energy poor ATP yield glycolysis appears elusive. Instead, due "reprogrammed" cancer cell metabolism, glycolysis used produce intermediates building blocks various biosynthetic pathways cancer cells.
