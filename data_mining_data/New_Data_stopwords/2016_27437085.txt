 half century since Warburg effect described, atypical metabolism standing true almost every type cancer, exhibiting higher glycolysis lactate metabolism defective mitochondrial ATP production. phenomenon attracted many scientists problem elucidating mechanism of, reason for, effect. Several models based oncogenic studies proposed, accumulation mitochondrial gene mutations, switch oxidative phosphorylation respiration glycolysis, enhancement lactate metabolism, alteration glycolytic genes. Whether Warburg phenomenon consequence genetic dysregulation cancer cause cancer remains unknown. Moreover, exact reasons physiological values peculiar metabolism cancer remain unclear. Although pharmacological compounds, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, dichloroacetic acid, 3-bromopyruvate, therapeutic strategies, including diet, developed based targeting Warburg effect. review, revisit Warburg effect determine much scientists currently understand phenomenon treat cancer based targeting metabolism.
