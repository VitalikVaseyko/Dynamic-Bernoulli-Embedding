 Escherichia coli, branch point Krebs cycle glyoxylate bypass regulated phosphorylation isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Phosphorylation inactivates IDH, forcing isocitrate bypass. bypass essential growth acetate serve useful function alternative carbon sources, glucose pyruvate, also present. pyruvate glucose added culture growing acetate, cells responded dephosphorylating IDH thus inhibiting flow isocitrate glyoxylate bypass. effort identify primary rate-limiting step response IDH phosphorylation alternative carbon sources, examined response rates congenic strains E. coli express different levels IDH kinase/phosphatase, bifunctional protein catalyzes phosphorylation cycle. rate pyruvate-induced dephosphorylation IDH proportional level IDH kinase/phosphatase, indicating IDH kinase/phosphatase primarily rate-limiting dephosphorylation. However, identity primary rate-limiting step appears depend stimulus, since rate dephosphorylation IDH response glucose independent level IDH kinase/phosphatase.
