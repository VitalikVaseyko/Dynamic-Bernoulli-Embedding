 Postmortem changes pork muscle protein phosphorylation relation RN(-) genotype investigated using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis phosphor specific staining. phosphorylation levels several protein bands found affected RN(-) genotype change postmortem development. Glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase found protein bands affected RN(-) genotype, phosphorylation profile indicates part increased rate extended pH decline RN(-) genotype could consequence phosphorylation key enzymes postmortem metabolism. results illustrate protein phosphorylation level muscle proteins could interpreted global metabolic fingerprint containing information activity status enzymes postmortem metabolism.
