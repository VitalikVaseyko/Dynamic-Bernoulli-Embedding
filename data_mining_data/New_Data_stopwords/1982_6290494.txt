 Recent studies demonstrated angiotensin II, catecholamines, vasopressin stimulate phosphorylation hepatic cytosolic proteins via Ca2+-linked cyclic AMP-independent mechanism. present study used high resolution, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis determine proteins phosphorylated response Ca2+-linked hormones distinct affected glucagon acting via cyclic AMP-dependent pathway. Intact hepatocytes labeled [32P]PO4(3-) stimulated glucagon, angiotensin II, l-norepinephrine, vasopressin 100 phosphorylated proteins resolved two-dimensional electrophoresis autoradiography. Six important enzymes known regulated covalent modification positively identified, including phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-6-phosphate, 2-kinase, phenylalanine hydroxylase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Computer analysis autoradiograms control hormone-treated cells demonstrated glucagon increased phosphorylation state 12 phosphoproteins reduced phosphorylation one protein Mr = 21,000 pI = 5.9. Ca2+-linked hormones stimulated phosphorylation 7 phosphoproteins also reduced phosphorylation state 21,000-dalton protein. Angiotensin II, l-norepinephrine, vasopressin equivalent effects protein phosphorylation. six protein substrates uniquely affected glucagon one phosphoprotein uniquely stimulated Ca2+-linked hormones. Seven substrates affected stimulation cell either glucagon Ca2+-linked hormones. results demonstrate that, overlap substrates affected glucagon Ca2+-linked hormones, pathway able affect phosphorylation unique substrates. finding suggests two types hormones may distinct effects hepatic function.U
