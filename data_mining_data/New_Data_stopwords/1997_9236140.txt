 Previous studies demonstrated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) activity extracts rat cardiac mitochondria increased @two-fold providing high-fat diet 28 days. present study sought establish factor(s) might underlie response cardiac PDHK provision high-fat diet. ELISA assays PDHKII, conducted range PDHK activities, demonstrated increase cardiac PDHK activity due increase mitochondrial immunoreactive PDHKII concentration. pyruvate concentration giving 50% active PDHC (PDHa) mitochondria incubated respiratory substrates unaffected high-fat feeding, demonstrating dissociation increased PDHK activity altered sensitivity PDHK suppression pyruvate. cardiac myocytes cultured (25 h) n-octanoate (1 mm) plus dibutyryl cAMP (50 microM), insulin 12.5 microU/ml, 25 microU/ml 75 microU/ml, suppressed PDHK activities cells prepared control rats, insulin concentrations <100 microU/ml failed suppress PDHK activities cardiac myocytes prepared high-fat-fed rats. vivo, cardiac insulin sensitivity (assessed euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp combination 2-[3H] deoxyglucose administration) suppressed high-fat feeding. sustained (24 h) two- four-fold elevation plasma insulin concentration (achieved insulin infusion via osmotic pumps) affect PDHK activity hearts control rats. contrast, PDHK activity hearts high-fat-fed rats suppressed values significantly different (insulin-infused) control rats. Basal agonist-stimulated cAMP concentrations unaffected high-fat-feeding insulin. Furthermore, rates palmitate oxidation (to CO2) cardiac myocytes (in absence presence insulin adrenergic agonists) statistically significantly affected high-fat-feeding. results indicate impaired action insulin suppress PDHK participates mechanism increased PDHK activity achieved response high-fat feeding, insulin act decreasing cAMP concentrations suppressing fatty acid oxidation.
