 Using mice lack retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 gene (Raldh1-/- mice), Kierfer et al demonstrated retinoids (metabolites Vitamin A) play important role regulation cellular metabolisms energetics. Aldh1a1-/- mice leaner less prone accumulate subcutaneous visceral fat, acquire insulin resistance high fat diet. lower fasting glucose levels concomitant reduced hepatic expression glucose 6-phosphatase phosphoenol pyruvate carboxy kinase genes indicated Aldh1a1-/- mice defective gluconeogenesis. mice also lower plasma levels triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein low-density lipoprotein-triacylglycerol, skeletal muscles elicited higher expression carnitine palmatoyl transferase, medium chain acyl-A dehydrogenase, peroxisome proliferation activated receptor (PPARalpha PPARdelta. Thus, improved lipid lipoprotein profiles Raldh1a1-/- mice resulted combination reduced lipogenesis enhanced fatty acid oxidation retinoids. mechanistic details retinoids integrate fasting glucose, hepatic gluconeogenesis adaptive thermogenesis independent body mass deserve study.
