 Open reading frames longer 300 bases observed antisense strands genes coding glycolytic enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase alcohol dehydrogenase I. open reading frames strands codon register. suggested proteins coded codon register complementary DNA strands bind other. Consequently, interesting investigate whether open reading frames antisense strands glycolytic enzyme genes functional. used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis PGI1 phosphoglucose isomerase gene introduce pairs closely spaced base substitutions resulted stop codons one strand silent replacements other. Introduction two stop codons PGI1 sense strand caused physiological defects already observed pgil deletion mutants. detectable effects caused two stop codons antisense strand. deletion removed section -31 bp +109 bp PGI1 gene left 83 bases 3' region beyond antisense open reading frame phenotype deletion removing reading frames. similar pair deletions PYK1 gene antisense reading frame showed identical defects. Northern experiments reported authors using double-stranded probes detected one transcript gene. observations indicate antisense reading frames functional. hand, evidence provided show rather long reading frames antisense strands glycolytic enzyme genes could arise strongly selective codon usage highly expressed yeast genes, reduces frequency stop codons antisense strand.
