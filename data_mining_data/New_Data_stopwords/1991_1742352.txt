 turnover EF-Tu.GTP poly-U programmed ribosomes measured presence absence N-acetylated Phe-tRNA(Phe) P-site. reaction uncoupled protein synthesis omitting Phe-tRNA(Phe) A-site. reaction, ribosome considered enzyme catalysing transition EF-Tu.GTP EF-Tu.GTP. constant EF-Tu.GTP concentration maintained regenerating GDP GTP expense phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. rate constants determined using procedure corrects reduction specific activity GTP due regeneration nucleotide. Ribosomes occupied P-site efficient stimulating GTPase EF-Tu.GTP ribosomes empty P-site. data suggest mainly caused increased affinity EF-Tu.GTP ribosomes filled P-site rather enhanced reactivity GTPase centre.
