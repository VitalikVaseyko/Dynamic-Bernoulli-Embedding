 Breast cancer frequently diagnosed cancer females. Warburg effect could enhance tumorigenesis garnered attention target tumor treatment. study, found mRNA protein levels hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1) breast cancer tissues higher corresponding noncancerous tissues. HK2, PKM2, PDK1 expression correlated statistically survival rate patients breast cancer. also demonstrated shorter fragment KISS1, Kisspeptin-10 (KP-10), inhibited Warburg effect induced mitochondrial injury human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. confirmed KP-10-inhibited Warburg effect activating Smad pathway. effects related mechanisms treatments also confirmed murine xenografts. However, additional studies needed confirm results cell types.
