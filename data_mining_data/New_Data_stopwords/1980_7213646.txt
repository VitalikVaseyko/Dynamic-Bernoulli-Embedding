 Effect several phosphoenolpyruvate analogs activity enoylpyruvate (phosphoenolpyruvate: UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose 2-enoyl-1-carboxyethyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.7) transferase examined. results suggest phosphoenolpyruvate binding site transferase similar pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40). Evidence presented show binding UDP-GlcNAc transferase enhances reactivity active site SH group.
