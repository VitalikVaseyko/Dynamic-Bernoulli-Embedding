 work prompted earlier findings beneficial effect increased oxygen supply wound healing. Enzyme activities limiting step glycolysis, citric acid cycle pentose phosphate cycle determined cellulose sponge implants rats chronically, breathing 12% O(2), air 55% O(2.) Respiratory gas tensions concentrations pyruvate lactate measured wound fluid aspirated implants. Significant portions repair tissue exist conditions extremely low oxygen tension. Probably added oxygen readily consumed, wound fluid PO(2) increased slightly hyperoxic environment. wound PCO(2) increased parallel inspired PO(2), probably due enhanced production carbon dioxide. Hyperoxia shifted wound metabolism anaerobic towards aerobic glycolysis. occurred concurrently activation citric acid cycle. Succinic dehydrogenase, linking enzyme citric acid cycle electron transfer chain, also increased increasing oxygen tension. oxygen-induced metabolical change previously observed many tissues.
