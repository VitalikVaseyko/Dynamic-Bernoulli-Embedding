 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-catalyzed inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex studied using dialyzed, soluble proteins mitochondria purified green leaf tissue Pisum sativum L. seedlings. subsaturating ATP concentrations, K+ NH4+, Na+, stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase lowering Km(ATP). Micromolar concentrations NH4+ required produce effect millimolar concentrations K+. apparent observations activation constant (Kact) NH4+ 0.1 mM, whereas Kact(K+) 0.7 mM. Maximal pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase velocities attained NH4+ higher K+, and, therefore, NH4+ able stimulate PDH kinase presence saturating K+. result supports conclusion photorespiratory NH4+ production plant mitochondria may involved regulating entry carbon Krebs cycle way pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
