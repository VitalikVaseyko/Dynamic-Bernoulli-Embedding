 Inflammatory changes major component normal tissue response ionizing radiation, increased nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity important mediator inflammatory responses. Here, used zebrafish embryos assess capacity two different classes pharmacologic agents known target NF-kappaB modify radiation toxicity vertebrate organism. proteasome inhibitors, including lactacystin, MG132, PS-341 (Bortezomib/VELCADE), direct inhibitors NF-kappaB activity, including ethyl pyruvate (EP) synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-TFEA (RTA401), among others. proteasome inhibitors either significantly affect radiation sensitivity zebrafish embryos (MG132, lactacystin) rendered zebrafish embryos sensitive lethal effects ionizing radiation (PS-341). Radiosensitization PS-341 reduced fish impaired p53 expression function associated enhanced expression select p53 target genes. contrast, direct NF-kappaB inhibitors EP CDDO-TFEA significantly improved overall survival lethally irradiated zebrafish embryos. addition, direct NF-kappaB inhibition reduced radiation-induced apoptosis central nervous system, abrogated aberrations body axis development, restored metabolization secretion reporter lipid gastrointestinal system, improved renal clearance compromised radiation. contrast amifostine, EP CDDO-TFEA protected also mitigated radiation toxicity given 1 2 hours postexposure. Finally, four additional IkappaB kinase inhibitors distinct mechanisms action similarly improved overall survival lethally irradiated zebrafish embryos. conclusion, inhibitors canonical pathways NF-kappaB activation may useful alleviating radiation toxicity patients.
