 Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) transcription factor mediates glucose signaling mammalian liver, leading expression different glycolytic lipogenic genes, pyruvate kinase (L-PK) fatty acid synthase (FAS). current model ChREBP activation response sugar phosphates holds glucose metabolization xylulose 5-phosphate (X-5-P) triggers activation protein phosphatase 2A, dephosphorylates ChREBP leads nuclear translocation activation. However, evidence indicates glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) likely signal metabolite glucose-induced transcription genes. glucose derivative responsible carbohydrate-dependent gene expression remains identified. difficulties measuring G-6-P X-5-P concentrations simultaneously changing independently hindered identification. discriminate possibilities, adapted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method identify quantify sugar phosphates human hepatocarcinoma cells (Hep G2) rat hepatocytes response different carbon sources presence/absence glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor. also used method demonstrate cells could metabolize 2-deoxyglucose beyond 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate. simultaneous quantification sugar phosphates FAS L-PK expression levels demonstrated X-5-P G-6-P play role modulation gene expression. conclusion, report presents first time single mechanism incorporates effects X-5-P G-6-P enhancement expression carbohydrate-responsive genes.
