 Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) activity subject complex allosteric regulation. Recently, serine SAICAR (succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribose-5'-phosphate) identified previously unrecognized activators PKM2. findings add additional complexity PKM2 regulated cells support notion modulating PKM2 activity enables cells adapt metabolic state specific physiological contexts.
