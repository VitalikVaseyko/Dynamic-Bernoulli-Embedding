 OBJECTIVE: diagnosis mitochondrial disorders (MDs) occasionally difficult patients often present solitary, combination of, symptoms caused organ insufficiency, may result respiratory chain enzyme deficiency. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) reported elevated serum patients MDs. study, investigated whether GDF-15 useful biomarker MDs several conventional biomarkers. METHODS: measured serum levels GDF-15 fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), well biomarkers, 48 MD patients 146 healthy controls Japan. GDF-15 FGF-21 concentrations measured enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay compared lactate, pyruvate, creatine kinase, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. calculated sensitivity specificity also evaluated correlation based two rating scales, including Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Rating Scale (NMDAS). RESULTS: Mean GDF-15 concentration 6-fold higher MD patients compared healthy controls (2,711 +/- 2,459 pg/ml vs 462.5 +/- 141.0 pg/mL; p < 0.001). Using receiver operating characteristic curve, area curve significantly higher GDF-15 FGF-21 conventional biomarkers. date suggest GDF-15 useful biomarker MDs biomarkers examined, associated MD severity. INTERPRETATION: results suggest measurement GDF-15 useful first-line test indicate patients mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency.
