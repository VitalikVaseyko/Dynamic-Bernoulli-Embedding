 Two kinetically distinct forms pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) isolated rabbit liver using differential ammonium sulphate fractionation. L liver form, allosterically activated fructose 1,6-diphosphate, partially purified DEAE-cellulose chromatography give maximum specific activity 20 units/mg. L form allosterically activated K(+) optimum activity recorded 30mm-K(+), 4mm-MgADP(-), MgADP(-)/ADP(2-) ratio 50:1, inhibition occurred K(+) concentrations excess 60mm. inhibition occurred either ATP GTP excess Mg(2+) added counteract chelation ligands. Alanine (2.5mm) caused 50% inhibition low concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate (0.15mm). homotropic effector, phosphoenolpyruvate, exhibited complex allosteric pattern (n(H)=2.5), negative co-operative interactions observed presence low concentrations substrate. degree co-operative interaction pH-dependent, Hill coefficient increasing 1.1 3.2 pH raised 6.5 8.0. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate interfered activation univalent ions, markedly decreased apparent K(m) phosphoenolpyruvate 1.2mm 0.2mm, transformed phosphoenolpyruvate saturation curve hyperbola. Concentrations fructose 1,6-diphosphate excess 0.5mm inhibited stimulated reaction. muscle-type form enzyme activated fructose 1,6-diphosphate gave maximum specific activity 0.3 unit/mg. Michaelis-Menten response obtained phosphoenolpyruvate variable substrate (K(m)=0.125mm), form inhibited ATP, well alanine, even presence excess Mg(2+).
