 Warburg effect metabolic hallmark cancer cells; cancer cells, unlike normal cells, exclusively activate glycolysis, even presence enough oxygen. hand, intratumoral heterogeneity currently interest cancer research, including involving cancer stem cells (CSCs). present study, attempted gain understanding metabolism CSCs distinct non-CSCs. forming spheroids OVTOKO (ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma) SiHa (cervical squamous cell carcinoma) cell lines, metabolites cells compared metabolites cancer cells cultured adherent plates. principle components analysis clearly divided metabolic features. Amino acids participate tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reactions, serine glutamine, significantly increased spheroids. Indeed, spheroids cell line contained total adenylates corresponding cells adherent cultures. study demonstrated cancer metabolism limited aerobic glycolysis (i.e. Warburg effect), flexible context-dependent. addition, activation TCA cycles suggested metabolic feature CSCs distinct non-CSCs. amino acid metabolic pathways discussed already considered targets cancer therapy, additionally proposed potential targets CSC treatment.
