 Several mixed-function oxidation systems catalyze inactivation Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase. Inactivation involves modification single histidine residue enzyme subunit makes enzyme susceptible proteolytic degradation. show 10 key enzymes metabolism inactivated bacterial NADH oxidase oxidase system comprised NADPH, cytochrome P-450 reductase, cytochrome P-450 isozyme 2 rabbit liver microsomes. inactivatable enzymes require divalent cation activity one (enolase) possess nucleotide binding site. Glutamine synthetase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase protected inactivation substrates; substrate protection enzymes tested. propose inactivation involves mixed-function oxidization system-catalyzed synthesis H(2)O(2) reduction Fe(III) Fe(II) followed oxidation enzyme-bound Fe(II) H(2)O(2) generate oxygen radicals attack histidine (or oxidizable amino acid) metal binding site enzyme. supported following: (i) inactivation reactions inhibited EDTA catalase, (ii) mixed-function oxidation systems reduce Fe(III), (iii) H(2)O(2) together Fe(II) catalyzes nonenzymic inactivation glutamine synthetase. view fact inactivation glutamine synthetase makes susceptible proteolytic degradation, possible mixed-function oxidation system-catalyzed inactivation enzymes regulatory step enzyme turn-over. addition, implication oxidative inactivation reactions ageing suggested fact many enzymes inactivated mixed-function oxidation systems known accumulate inactive forms ageing.
