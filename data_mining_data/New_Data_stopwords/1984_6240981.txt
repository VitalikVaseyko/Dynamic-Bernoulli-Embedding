 effect alloxan glucokinase isolated rat hepatocytes studied. Exposure hepatocytes alloxan (3 mM) 30 degrees C 5 min produced marked inhibition (77%) glucokinase activity altered slightly phosphofructokinase activity (32% inhibition). Pyruvate kinase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, however, inhibited all. Alloxan induced concentration-dependent inhibition glucokinase activity detectable inhibition alloxan concentration 1 mM. inhibition glucokinase activity alloxan protected simultaneous presence 15 mM hexose D-glucose, 3-O-methylglucose, D-mannose. D-Galactose showed protective effect. results suggest alloxan may exert cytotoxic action inhibition glucokinase activity liver also pancreatic islets, since liver islet glucokinases known quite similar various properties.
