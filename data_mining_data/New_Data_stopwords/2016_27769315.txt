 BACKGROUND: Accumulating researches shown epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes tumor metastasis. Leptin, key adipokine secreted adipocytes, shapes tumor microenvironment, potentiates migration breast cancer cells angiogenesis, also involved EMT. However, potential mechanism remains unknown. study aims explore effect leptin EMT breast cancer cells underlying mechanism. METHODS: assessment EMT-associated marker expression MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468 cells, effect leptin breast cancer cells analyzed. Besides, array pathway inhibitors well RNA interference targeting pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) used clarify underlying mechanism leptin-mediated EMT vitro vivo. RESULTS: results demonstrated leptin promoted breast cancer cells EMT, visibly activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, upregulated PKM2 expression. antibody leptin receptor (anti-ObR) PI3K/AKT signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002 significantly abolished leptin-induced PKM2 expression EMT-associated marker expression. SiRNA targeting PKM2 partially abolished leptin-induced migration, invasion, EMT-associated marker expression. vivo xenograft experiments indicated RNA interference PKM2 suppressed breast cancer growth metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: data suggest leptin promotes EMT breast cancer cells via upregulation PKM2 expression well activation PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, PKM2 might one key points potential targets breast cancer therapy.
