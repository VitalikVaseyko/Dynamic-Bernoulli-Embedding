 Normal proliferating cells tumour cells particular express pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK, PKM2). quaternary structure M2-PK determines whether glucose carbons degraded pyruvate lactate production energy (tetrameric form) channelled synthetic processes, debranching glycolytic intermediates nucleic acid, amino acid phospholipid synthesis. tetramer:dimer ratio M2-PK regulated metabolic intermediates, fructose 1,6-P2 direct interaction different oncoproteins, pp60v-src kinase, HPV-16 E7 A-Raf. metabolic function interaction M2-PK HERC1 oncoprotein remains unknown. Thus, M2-PK meeting point different oncogenes metabolism. tumour cells, dimeric form M2-PK predominant therefore termed Tumour M2-PK. Tumour M2-PK released tumours blood gastrointestinal tumours also stool tumour patients. quantification Tumour M2-PK EDTA plasma stool tool early detection tumours therapy control.
