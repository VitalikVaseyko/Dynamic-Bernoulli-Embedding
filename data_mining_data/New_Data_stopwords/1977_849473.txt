 order assess extent metabolism within sheep placenta may influence transfer metabolites mother foetus different stages gestation activities enzymes concerned aspects carbohydrate, amino acid keton body metabolism determined placental cotyledons resected ewes last three months pregnancy. activities pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), ATP citrate (pro-3S)-lyase (EC 4.1.3.8), citrate (si)-synthase (EC 4.1.3.7), acetyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.1), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.9) 3-keto acid CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.5) per gram wet weight cotyledon change period studied. activities alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2), aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.42), ornithine-oxoacid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13) 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) show increase activity third fourth months pregnancy whilst activities arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) possibly pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) show increase activity fourth final months pregnancy. Ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) activity declines one tenth activity later period. absence detectable activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) indicate gluconeogenesis urea synthesis ammonia occur sheep placenta. appears ability placenta metabolise several substrates achieved time placenta reaches maximum size approximately 90 days.
