 transcription factor carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) emerged central regulator lipid synthesis liver required glucose-induced expression glycolytic enzyme liver-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) acts synergy SREBP induce lipogenic genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) fatty acid synthase (FAS). Liver X receptors (LXRs) also important regulators lipogenic pathway, recent finding ChREBP direct target LXRs glucose bind activate LXRs prompted us study role LXRs induction glucose-regulated genes liver. Using LXR agonist wild-type mice, found LXR stimulation promote ChREBP phosphorylation nuclear localization absence increased intrahepatic glucose flux. Furthermore, induction ChREBP, L-PK, ACC glucose high-carbohydrate diet similar LXRalpha/beta knockout compared wild-type mice, suggesting activation genes glucose occurs LXR-independent mechanism. used fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrate glucose failed promote interaction LXRalpha/beta specific cofactors. Finally, siRNA silencing ChREBP LXRalpha/beta knockout hepatocytes abrogated glucose-induced expression L-PK ACC, demonstrating central role ChREBP glucose signaling. Taken together, results demonstrate glucose required ChREBP functional activity LXRs necessary induction glucose-regulated genes liver.
