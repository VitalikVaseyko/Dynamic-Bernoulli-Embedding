 Dichloroacetate (DCA) potential environmental hazard investigational drug. Repeated doses DCA result reduced drug clearance, probably inhibition glutathione transferase zeta1 (GSTZ1), cytosolic enzyme converts DCA glyoxylate. DCA known taken mitochondria, inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, major pharmacodynamic target. tested hypothesis mitochondrion also site DCA biotransformation. Immunoreactive GSTZ1 detected liver mitochondria humans rats, identity confirmed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis tryptic peptides. Study rat submitochondrial fractions revealed GSTZ1 localized mitochondrial matrix. specific activity GSTZ1-catalyzed dechlorination DCA 2.5- 3-fold higher cytosol whole mitochondria directly proportional GSTZ1 protein expression two compartments. Rat mitochondrial GSTZ1 2.5-fold higher (App)K(m) glutathione cytosolic GSTZ1, whereas (App)K(m) values DCA identical. Rats administered DCA dose 500 mg/kg/day 8 weeks showed reduced hepatic GSTZ1 activity expression approximately 10% control levels cytosol mitochondria. conclude mitochondrion novel site DCA biotransformation catalyzed GSTZ1, enzyme colocalized cytosol mitochondrial matrix.
