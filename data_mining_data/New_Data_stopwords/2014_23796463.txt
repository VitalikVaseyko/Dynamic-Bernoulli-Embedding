 widening recognition cancer cells products complex developmental processes. Carcinogenesis metastasis formation increasingly described systems-level, network phenomena. propose malignant transformation two-phase process, initial increase system plasticity followed decrease plasticity late stages carcinogenesis model cellular learning. describe hallmarks increased system plasticity early, tumor initiating cells, increased noise, entropy, conformational phenotypic plasticity, physical deformability, cell heterogeneity network rearrangements. Finally, argue large structural changes molecular networks cancer development necessitate rather different targeting strategy early late phase carcinogenesis. Plastic networks early phase cancer development need central hit, rigid networks late stage primary tumors established metastases attacked network influence strategy, edgetic, multi-target, allo-network drugs. Cancer stem cells need special diagnosis targeting, since dormant rapidly proliferating forms may rigid, plastic networks, respectively. extremely high ability cancer stem cells change rigidity/plasticity networks may key hallmark. application early stage-optimized anti-cancer drugs late-stage patients may reason many failures anti-cancer therapies. hypotheses presented underlie need patient-specific multi-target therapies applying correct ratio central hits network influences - optimized sequence.
