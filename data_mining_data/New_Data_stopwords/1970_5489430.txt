 Peripheral hyphae separated remaining thallus Rhizoctonia solani exponential stationary phases growth. QO(2) whole cells peripheral hyphae young fungal colonies average 2.6 times protein content 1.6 times greater peripheral hyphae old fungal colonies. overall rate amino acid uptake less old young fungal colonies. polyuridylic acid-polyphenylalanine incorporating system, two kinds peripheral hyphae required ribosomes, supernatant fraction, polyuridylic acid, soluble ribonucleic acid, adenosine triphosphate, pyruvate kinase. rate polyphenylalanine synthesis old fungal colonies slower young fungal colonies. ribosomes supernatant fraction young old fungal colonies interchangeable active. factor responsible deficient protein synthesis old fungal colonies appears soluble fraction mycelium.
