 Fungal dimorphism important survival different environments related virulence. ascomycete Yarrowia lipolytica grow yeast, pseudomycelial mycelial forms. used Y. lipolytica parental strain Deltahoy1 mutant, unable form hypha, set model dimorphism characterize depth yeast hypha transition proteomic techniques. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) based differential expression analysis Y. lipolytica yeast hyphal cells performed, 45 differentially expressed proteins detected; nine decreased expression hyphal cells identified. corresponded S. cerevisiae homologues Imd4p, Pdx3p, Cdc19, Sse1p, Sol3p, Sod2p, Xpt1p, Mdh1p unknown protein YALIOB00924g. Remarkably, proteins involved metabolic pathways, four showing oxidoreductase activity. Furthermore, taking account first report 2-DE analysis Y. lipolytica protein extracts, 35 proteins 2D map soluble yeast proteins, involved metabolism, cell rescue, energy protein synthesis, identified.
