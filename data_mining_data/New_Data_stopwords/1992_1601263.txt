 Injection pharmacological doses dexamethasone (5 mg/kg) and/or bovine glucagon (1 mg/kg) exerts pronounced effects toadfish liver compared vehicle-treated control fish. Affected parameters include hepatic levels glycogen activities glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, malate dehydrogenase, enzymes involved NADPH generation well kinetics pyruvate kinase. Activities tyrosine aminotransferase, however, prime target hormonal induction mammals, remain unchanged Opsanus. subsequently isolated toadfish hepatocytes, metabolite concentrations flux gluconeogenesis altered vitro responses epinephrine catfish glucagon previously injected fish. Contrary existing mammalian models, short-term regulation urea cycle activity ruled toadfish, since hormone treatments fail influence activity two ornithine-urea cycle enzymes rate hepatocyte-urea synthesis. Treatment-dependent increases hepatic glutamine synthetase, unique feeder enzyme ammonia "nitrogen" fish urea cycle, indicate potentially pivotal role enzyme longer-term regulation ureogenesis.
