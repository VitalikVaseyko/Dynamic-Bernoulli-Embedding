 Common terns (Sterna hirundo), sooty terns (S. fuscata) brown noddies (Anous stolidus) phylogenetically related seabirds differ field activity levels daily energy expenditure. test whether muscle metabolic capacities co-evolve activity levels energy expenditure, collected pectoral muscle biopsies members species, measured activities key enzymes oxidative metabolism (citrate synthase, CS), anaerobic metabolism (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, PK), fatty acid oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase) phosphocreatine hydrolysis (creatine phosphokinase, CPK). hypothesized temperate-breeding common terns would higher enzyme activities two tropical species (sooty terns brown noddies); consistent higher activity level common terns. differences enzyme activities among adults three species. Common tern chicks within 2-3 days flight two-fold higher pyruvate kinase activity adults, suggesting increased glycolytic capacity chicks. Given lack difference among species enzymatic level, results support notion behavior whole organism performance evolve considerably detectable changes underlying lower-level physiological/biochemical traits.
