 Activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase studied rat heart emotional-painful stress development myocardium necrosis. stress caused activation hexokinase phosphofructokinase within 2 7 days, activity pyruvate kinase altered. myocardium necrosis developed emotional-painful stress activity phosphofructokinase decreased within 2 days compared animals, myocardial necrosis produces using routine procedures.
