 OBJECTIVE: determine: (a) whether active pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) activity interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) acutely regulated altered insulin status euglycaemia; (b) relationship glucose uptake/phosphorylation PDHa activities IBAT vivo; (c) impact increased dietary lipid regulation glucose uptake oxidation insulin IBAT comparison exerted various white adipose tissue depots. DESIGN: Rats provided either standard diet (8% fat, 72% carbohydrate, energy) diet moderately high saturated fat (47%, energy) low carbohydrate (33%, energy) four weeks. Rats studied absorptive state, post-absorptive state 2.5 h euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia. Tissues sampled included IBAT four white adipose tissue depots, two abdominal (parametrial (PM) perirenal (PR)) two superficial (subcutaneous (SC) interscapular (IS)). MEASUREMENTS: Whole-body glucose disposal estimated using [3-3H]glucose. Glucose uptake/phosphorylation vivo estimated using 2-deoxy[1-3H]-D-glucose. Insulin action evaluated using euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique. PDHa activity assayed spectrophotometrically freeze-clamped tissue extracts. PDH kinase (PDK) activities assayed mitochondrial extracts rates ATP-dependent PDHa inactivation. RESULTS: Whole-body glucose disposal decreased high-fat-feeding post-absorptive state (P < 0.05) euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (P < 0.01). Glucose transport/phosphorylation IBAT decreased high-fat feeding absorptive (P < 0.001) post-absorptive states (by 84%, P < 0.05) steady-state euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (by 73%, P < 0.001). IBAT PDHa activities suppressed high-fat feeding. Euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia post-absorptive control rats increased PDHa activities IBAT (P < 0.001) values comparable found absorptive state. Although IBAT PDHa activities increased euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia post-absorptive high-fat-fed rats, remained lower (by 55%; P < 0.01) controls. failure hyperinsulinaemia normalise IBAT pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) activities high-fat-fed rats associated stable 1.4-fold increase IBAT PDK activity. High-fat feeding decreased glucose utilisation rates post-absorptive state IS, SC, PM PR white adipose tissue depots. Euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia significantly increased glucose utilisation three four depots control rats, elicit statistically-significant changes high-fat-fed rats. High-fat feeding influenced PDHa activity PR, without significant effect PDHa activity PM, SC IS. CONCLUSIONS: results demonstrate PDHa activity IBAT rats maintained standard diet responds changes insulin concentrations low physiological range, inactivation PDHa IBAT feeding diet moderately high saturated fat consequence induction tissue insulin resistance. Effects dietary regime PDHa activity paralleled changes insulin-stimulated glucose uptake/phosphorylation IBAT vivo, IBAT specifically targeted, moderate effects white adipose tissue. finding impaired activation BAT glucose transport/phosphorylation PDHa activity response insulin may contribute impaired thermogenesis rats maintained diets containing relatively high proportion saturated fat.
