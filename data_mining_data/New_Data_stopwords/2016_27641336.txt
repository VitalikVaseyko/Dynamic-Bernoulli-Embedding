 Reprogrammed metabolism one hallmarks cancer. dysregulation glycolysis cancer heavily studied. However, remains largely unclear metabolic processes regulated cancer cells. show microRNA-182 (miR-182) suppresses pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4 (PDK4) promotes lung tumorigenesis. miR-182 dysregulated inversely correlated PDK4 human lung adenocarcinomas. miR-182-PDK4 axis regulates lung cancer cell growth modulating activity PDH, gatekeeping enzyme pyruvate flux acetyl-CoA, subsequently de novo lipogenesis cancer cells. Suppression lipogenesis silencing ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) fatty acid synthase (FASN) chemical inhibitors diminishes effects miR-182-PDK4 tumor growth. Alteration de novo lipogenesis also affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) production downstream JNK signaling pathway. Hence, work suggests miR-182-PDK4 axis crucial regulator cancer cell metabolism potential target antitumor therapy.
