 Metal pollution causes disturbances various levels biological organization species. Important physiological functions could affected exposed individuals among main physiological functions, immunity may provide one (or more) effector(s) whose expression directly affected metal exposure various macroinvertebrates. Protein expressions studied order test molecular biomarkers metal exposure Eisenia fetida. Selected effectors calmodulin, heat shock proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, metallothionein, beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, pyruvate carboxylase, transcriptionally controlled tumor protein, protein kinase C, ubiquitin cyclophilin-A. level expression gene analysed whole organism following exposures cadmium soil using real-time PCR. Metallothionein, transcriptionally controlled tumor protein cyclophilin-A expression also measured following copper exposures soil genes seemed sensitive copper. work enabled distinguish metallothionein cyclophilin-A among 15 selected effectors. strong decrease number transcripts also detected effectors soon exposure cadmium suggesting trade-off mechanism occurs.
