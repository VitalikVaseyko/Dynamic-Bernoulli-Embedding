 Disordered cancer metabolism described almost century ago abnormal adaptation cancer cells glucose utilization especially hypoxic conditions; so-called Warburg effect. Greater research interest area past two decades led recognition critical coupling specific malignant phenotypes increased proliferation resistance programmed cell death (apoptosis) altered metabolic handling key molecules essential normal cellular metabolism. altered glucose metabolism frequently encountered cancer cells already exploited cancer diagnosis treatment. role glycolytic pathway intermediates alternative pathways energy generation macromolecular synthesis cancer cells become recognized recently. Especially, important role altered glutamine metabolism malignant behavior cancer cells potential exploitation cellular adaptation therapeutic targeting emerged important area cancer research. Expectedly, attempts exploit understanding diagnostic therapeutic ends running apace elucidation complex metabolic alterations accompany neoplastic transformation. lung cancer leading cause cancer death limited curative therapy options, careful elucidation mechanism consequences disordered cancer metabolism lung cancer warranted. review provides concise, systematic overview current understanding role altered glutamine metabolism cancer, findings intersect current future approaches lung cancer management.
