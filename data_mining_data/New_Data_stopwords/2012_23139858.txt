 investigate whether altered energy metabolism induces Warburg effect results tumor malignancy, respiratory enzyme citrate synthase (CS) examined, silenced, effects analyzed. human cervical carcinoma cells, RNAi-mediated CS knockdown induced morphological changes characteristic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). switch accelerated cancer cell metastasis proliferation vitro assays vivo tumor xenograft models. Notably, CS knockdown cells exhibited severe defects respiratory activity marked decreases ATP production, great increases glycolytic metabolism. malignant progression due activation EMT-related regulators; altered energy metabolism resulted deregulation p53/TIGAR SCO2 pathways. phenotypic change completely reversed p53 reactivation via treatment proteasome inhibitor MG132 co-knockdown E3 ligase HDM2 partially suppressed ATP treatment. study directly links Warburg effect tumor malignancy via induction EMT phenotype.
