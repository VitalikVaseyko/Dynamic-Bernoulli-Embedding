 goal present study determine whether loss insulin receptor alters molecular landscape intestinal mucosa, using intestinal-epithelial insulin receptor knockout (IE-irKO) mice genetic (IRfl/fl Villin-cre) controls. Quantitative proteomic analysis liquid chromatography mass spectrometry applied jejunal colonic mucosa mice fed normal chow diet mice fed Western diet (WD). Jejunal mucosa IE-irKO mice demonstrated alterations intestinal cell lineages: Paneth, goblet, absorptive, enteroendocrine cells. goblet absorptive cells affected colon. Also, marked effect WD consumption found gut proteome. substantial reduction detected Paneth cell proteins antimicrobial activity, including lysozyme C-1, angiogenin-4, cryptdin-related sequence 1C-3 -2, alpha-defensin 17, intelectin-1a. key protein expressed goblet cells, mucin-2, also reduced IE-irKO mice. Proteins involved lipid metabolism, including aldose reductase-related protein 1, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, apolipoprotein A-II, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4, increased mucosa WD-fed IE-irKO mice compared controls. contrast, expression nutrient-responsive gut hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide neurotensin, reduced jejunal mucosa IE-irKO mice, expression proteins P-type adenosine triphosphatases solute carrier-transporter family reduced colon WD-fed IE-irKO mice. conclusion, IE-irKO mice display distinct molecular phenotype, suggesting biological role insulin receptor determining differentiated cell specificity intestinal epithelium.
