 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) noncoding RNAs specific regulatory role gene expression. Recent reports suggested involvement human malignancies. Currently, information concerning miRNA expression functions squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tongue. study, evaluated expression patterns 156 mature miRNAs tongue SCC using Taqman-based microRNA assays. 156 miRNAs, miR-133a miR-133b significantly reduced tongue SCC cells comparison paired normal epithelial cells. Tongue SCC cell lines transfected miR-133a miR-133b precursors displayed reduction proliferation rate. addition, number apoptotic cells increased response introduction precursors. Computational target gene prediction suggested miR-133a miR-133b targeting transcript pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2), potential oncogene solid cancers. tongue SCC cell lines, PKM2 expression reduced response miR-133a miR-133b precursors transfection. Immunohistochemical staining results tongue SCC tissues suggested PKM2 overexpressed tongue SCC associated downregulation miR-133a miR-133b. results suggested aberrant reduction miR-133a miR-133b associated dysregulation PKM2 SCC tongue.
