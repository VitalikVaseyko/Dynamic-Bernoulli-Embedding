 effect chronic administration 6 weeks anabolic steroid, nandrolone phenylpropionate (Durabolin), studied three predominantly glycolytic muscles, three oxidative muscles sedentary female rats. Mean blood pressure resting heart rate (HR) lower anabolic-treated group, increase HR stimulation EDL reduced. change noted aerobic capacity ventricular myocardium, although increase skeletal muscles due combination increased capillary supply and/or TCA cycle enzyme activity. Capillary:fibre ratio (C:F) increased around 10% glycolytic muscle little effect resting blood flow (BF). EDL C:F 1.1 +/- 0.02 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.01 BF 7.0 +/- 1.45 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.82 ml min-1 100 g-1 control Durabolin treated animals, respectively (means +/- SEM, n = 7). increase citrate synthase (CS) activity evident. soleus, C:F significantly different groups, CS activity increased 3.9 +/- 0.34 5.9 +/- 0.40 microM g-1 min-1 (means +/- SEM, n = 7). Glycolytic capacity, indicated pyruvate kinase activity, increased diaphragm. data demonstrate total oxidative metabolism striated muscle necessarily increase greater proportion FOG fibres, always correlated capillary supply. positive myotrophic effect Durabolin represents sum modest changes different levels organisation.
