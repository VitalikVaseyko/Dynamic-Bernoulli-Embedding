 activities Na+,K(+)-ATPase plasma membrane, cytosolic enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase (GlGD) mitochondria measured leukocytes (WBC) dogs cats clarify differences energy metabolism cells. Feline WBC significantly higher activities hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK) LDH pyruvate substrate canine WBC. Canine WBC significantly higher activities glucokinase (GK) GlDH feline WBC. Feline WBC unique characteristics energy metabolism activities cytosolic enzymes anaerobic conditions significantly higher canine WBC. therefore appears distinct differences glucose-metabolism WBC dogs cats. WBC enzyme activities considered reflect metabolic state whole body animal. therefore suggested changes activities certain glycolytic enzymes WBC may useful diagnostic indicator types metabolic disease dogs cats.
