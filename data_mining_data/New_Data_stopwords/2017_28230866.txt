 Warburg effect important characteristic tumor cells, making attractive therapeutic target. Current anticancer drug development strategies predominantly focus inhibitors specific molecular effectors involved tumor cell proliferation. drugs natural compounds, many target Warburg effect underlying mechanisms, still need characterized. elucidate anticancer effects natural diterpenoid, oridonin, first demonstrated anticancer activity oridonin vitro vivo colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. miRNA profiling SW480 cells revealed intracellular signaling related energy supply affected oridonin, suggesting glucose metabolism potential target CRC therapy. Moreover, results indicated oridonin induced metabolic imbalances significantly inhibiting glucose uptake reducing lactate export significantly downregulating protein levels GLUT1 MCT1 vitro vivo. However, ATP level oridonin-treated CRC cells decreased oridonin blocked glucose supply, indicating oridonin induced autophagy process, important ATP source cancer cells. observation supported results LC3-II detection transmission electron microscopy analysis, confirmed presence autophagy. Furthermore, p-AMPK rapidly deactivated following oridonin treatment, resulting downregulation GLUT1 induction autophagy cancer cells. Thus finding helped clarify anticancer mechanisms oridonin suggested could applied glucose metabolism-targeting agent cancer treatment.
