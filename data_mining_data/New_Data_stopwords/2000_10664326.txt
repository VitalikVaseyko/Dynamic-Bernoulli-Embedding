 aim study estimate influence transplantation neonatal pancreas singenic donors glucose production utilisation alloxan diabetic mice. alloxan diabetic mice, 20 days alloxan, received neonatal pancreas singenic donors kidney capsule. Enzymes involved glycolytic, gluconeogenic, lipogenic pentose phosphate pathway examined liver experimental mice. fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase (FDPase) activity liver diabetics increased 60%, pyruvate inase (PK) ATP-citrate lyase (CEE) activity decreased 40% values healthy mice. values glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGDH) statistically different diabetic liver compared liver healthy animals. pancreas transplantation diabetic animals become normoglycaemic, others remained hyperglycaemic. FDPase activity hyperglycaemic diabetic recipients similar diabetic mice received transplant, normoglycaemic recipients FDPase activity returned normal values. However, activities PK CCE hyperglycaemic recipients similar healthy animals, normogglycaemic recipients enzyme activities much higher. Results obtained showed glycolytic, gluconeogenic lipogenic enzyme activities liver normoglycaemic mice received pancreas transplant reached approximate physiological values within 30 days transplantation.
