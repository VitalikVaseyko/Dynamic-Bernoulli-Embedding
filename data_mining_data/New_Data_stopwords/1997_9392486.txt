 Glucose, potent insulin secretagogue, stimulates insulin secretion aerobic glycolysis, secretagogues stimulate insulin release exclusively mitochondrial metabolism. well known intact pancreatic beta-cell, either kind secretagogue induce oscillations metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, ATP/ADP, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H ratios) occur periodicity similar oscillations membrane electrical potential insulin secretion. study, pancreatic islet cytosol mitochondrial fractions incubated presence physiological concentrations substrates. Repeated additions physiological effectors caused oscillations activities three enzymes studied. Succinate dehydrogenase activity islet mitochondrial extracts made oscillate adding oxaloacetate (5 micromol/l) inhibit enzyme. enzyme reactivated adding acetyl-CoA (3 micromol/l), combines oxaloacetate citrate synthase reaction lowers concentration oxaloacetate, thus beginning another oscillation. Pyruvate kinase activity made oscillate adding fructose bisphosphate (10 micromol/l). Fructose bisphosphate degraded triose phosphates fairly rapidly, and, degraded, parallel decrease pyruvate kinase activity. enzyme reactivated made oscillate subsequent additions fructose bisphosphate. mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase made oscillate adding EGTA chelate calcium, activates enzyme. concentration free calcium raised >0.1 micromol/l adding calcium, activity enzyme increased. Repeated additions chelator calcium caused enzyme activity oscillate. results three enzymes physiological concentrations naturally occurring effectors raise possibility activities enzymes numerous enzymes oscillate vivo response levels allosteric effectors substrates. case, pacemaker activity may result complex effects distributed across multiple regulatory sites cytosol mitochondria, rather single enzyme acting primary pacemaker.
