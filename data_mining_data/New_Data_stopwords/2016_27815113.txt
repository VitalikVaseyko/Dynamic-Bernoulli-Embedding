 Myopathy commonly reported adverse effect statins. statins associated myopathy, though different rates. Rosuvastatin potent statin reported induce myopathy comparable earlier statins. However, clinical practice patients could tolerate rosuvastatin statins. study aimed evaluate myopathic pattern rosuvastatin rats using biochemical, functional histopathological examinations. possible deleterious effects rosuvastatin muscle mitochondria also examined. obtained results compared myopathy induced atorvastatin equimolar dose. Results showed rosuvastatin induced rise CK, slight increase myoglobin level together mild muscle necrosis. Motor activity, assessed rotarod, showed rosuvastatin decreased rats' performance. manifestations obviously mild compared prominent effects atorvastatin. Parallel results obtained mitochondrial dysfunction parameters. Rosuvastatin induced slight increase LDH minor decrease ATP ( approximately 14%) pAkt ( approximately 12%). hand, atorvastatin induced increase LDH, lactate/pyruvate ratio pronounced decline ATP ( approximately 80%) pAkt ( approximately 65%). findings showed rosuvastatin associated mild myotoxic effects rats, especially compared atorvastatin.
