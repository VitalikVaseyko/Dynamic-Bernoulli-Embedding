 Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase catalyzes one first reactions biosynthesis carbohydrates. Apart physiologically important reaction, enzyme also presents low oxaloacetate decarboxylase pyruvate kinase-like activities. Data crystalline structure homologous Escherichia coli PEP carboxykinase suggest Arg(333) may involved stabilization enolpyruvate, postulated reaction intermediate. work, equivalent Arg(336) S. cerevisiae enzyme changed Lys Gln. Kinetic analyses varied enzymes showed positive charge position 336 critical catalysis main reaction, suggested different rate limiting steps main reaction secondary activities. Arg336Lys altered enzyme showed increased oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity developed ability catalyze pyruvate enolization. last results support proposal enolpyruvate intermediate PEP carboxykinase reaction suggest Arg336Lys PEP carboxykinase proton donor group appeared.
