 mechanism activation inorganic phosphate ATP cardiac muscle pyruvate kinase studied aid steady-state kinetics. enzyme purified homogeneity final specific activity 400 units/mg (phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 25 degrees C). pH 7.6 enzyme displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics respect substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate ADP. Substrate kinetic constants are: app.Km(phosphoenolpyruvate) = 0.04 mM, app.Km(ADP) = 0.22 mM. conditions used standard assay specific activity greatly enhanced inorganic phosphate (50 mM) ATP (2.5 mM). modifiers, acting separately, increases Vmax without seriously affecting Michaelis constants Hill coefficients. presence Pi ATP, decrease Vmax observed. kinetics activation inorganic phosphate pyruvate kinase examined. Studying effect varying concentrations Pi initial rate obtained hyperbolic saturation curve app.Km(Pi) = 20 mM Vmax = 167 units/mg. evidence presented inorganic phosphate substrate side reaction catalyzed cardiac pyruvate kinase. shown presence pyruvate, inorganic phosphate ATP assay system, Pi incorporated acid-labile products reaction, inorganic pyrophosphate one them. findings indicate existence alternative reaction catalyzed pyruvate kinase energy may stored form inorganic pyrophosphate.
