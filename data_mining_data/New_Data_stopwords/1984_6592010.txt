 investigate erythroid nature two human erythroleukemia cell lines, K562 HEL-60, define ontogeny pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes (R, M2) developing human erythroid cells, studied isozymic alterations, any, differentiation cell lines vitro normoblasts isolated fetal liver vivo. PK activity erythroleukemic cell lines intermediate observed leukocytes fetal liver erythroblasts. cell lines contained high level M2-PK, R-PK always present, albeit low concentrations, clones subclones studied. Erythroblasts fetal liver separated according density Stractan gradient. R-PK levels nearly constant different fractions, whereas M2-PK levels markedly decreased erythroblasts became mature almost completely disappeared late erythroid cells. Thus, results clearly demonstrate erythroid origin cell lines.
