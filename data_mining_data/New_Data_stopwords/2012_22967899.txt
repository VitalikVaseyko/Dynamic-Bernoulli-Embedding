 N-alpha-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) anti-tumorigenic properties, direct cellular targets unknown. Previously, showed TPCK inhibited PDKl-dependent AGC kinases RSK, Akt S6K1 without inhibiting PKA, ERK1/2, PI3K, PDK1 itself. show TPCK-inhibition RSK-related kinases MSK1 2, activated independently PDK1. Mass spectrometry analysis RSK1, Aktl, S6K1 MSK1 immunopurified TPCK-treated cells identified TPCK adducts cysteines located conserved activation loop Phenylalanine-Cysteine (Phe-Cys) motifs. Mutational analysis Phe-Cys residues conferred partial TPCK resistance. studies elucidate primary mechanism TPCK inhibits several AGC kinases, inviting consideration TPCK-like compounds chemotherapy given potential broad control cellular growth, proliferation survival.
