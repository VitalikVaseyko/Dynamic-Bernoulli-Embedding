 regulatory properties type L pyruvate kinase Rana pipiens intermediate mammalian K L isozymes. mammalian type L, levels frog isozyme affected animal's nutritional state. mammalian amphibian isozymes show similar sensitivities fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activation amino acid inhibition. contrast, frog L isozyme shares several properties K class: i.e. irreversible inactivation oxidized glutathione lack response cyclic AMP stimulated phosphorylation. Furthermore, mammalian K isozymes, frog type L shows high PEP affinity low cooperativity PEP binding. Insofar properties present day enzyme reflect counterpart amphibian ancestor higher vertebrates, results suggest first expression, type L resembled type K. Many important regulatory properties L isozyme, especially sensitivity phosphorylation, acquired recently perhaps association increased importance constant blood glucose.
