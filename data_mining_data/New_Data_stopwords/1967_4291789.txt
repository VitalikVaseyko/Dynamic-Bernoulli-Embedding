 1. Rats two strains kept three different diets; one commercial diet rat pellets, one contained 80% sucrose 20% casein supplemented corn oil, third similar diet without corn oil. 2. commercial diet, specific activities pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase fructose 1,6-diphosphatase livers one strain rats (strain A) 1.5-3 times strain (strain B). diet high sucrose supplemented corn oil given, large increases specific activity pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase fructose 1,6-diphosphatase livers strain rats. strain B rats increases much smaller. Omission corn oil diet caused threefold increase specific activity glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase strain B rats, little effect enzymes. 3. enzymes kidneys hearts strain rats also active strain B rats. strain rats, specific activities pyruvate kinase fructose 1,6-diphosphatase kidney increased sucrose content diet high, kidneys strain B rats little change. 4. strain rats, specific activity pyruvate kinase heart doubled high-sucrose-corn oil diet increased threefold corn oil omitted. changes seen strain B rats. 5. strain rats, omission corn oil diet increased ability kidneys synthesize glucose lactate. 6. strain B rats, addition corn oil diet resulted decrease liver specific activity ATP citrate lyase ability incorporate acetate lipid.
