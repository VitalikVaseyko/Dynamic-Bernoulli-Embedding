 effect fructose induction L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA diabetic rat liver studied using cloned cDNA probe. Fructose feeding resulted 5- 6-fold increase L-type enzyme mRNA level 1 3 days. changes approximately proportional changes level translatable mRNA enzyme. significant increase total cellular L-type enzyme mRNA level observed within 2 h fructose feeding level reached maximum 8 h. Dietary glycerol also markedly increased L-type mRNA level. alterations essentially due changes cytosolic mRNA. Northern blot analysis total cellular RNA revealed two L-type enzyme mRNA species molecular sizes 2.1 3.6 kilobases proportionally increased fructose induction. two mRNA forms found immunopurified L-type enzyme mRNA directed synthesis L-type subunit vitro; therefore functional mature forms. contrast, analysis nuclear RNA showed five putative precursor RNA species enzyme, 9.4 kilobases length, liver fructose-fed rats, band RNA species found nuclei control liver. changes number bands RNA species intensities fructose feeding preceded changes level total cellular L-type enzyme mRNA sequences. results indicate dietary fructose causes rapid increase level L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA sequences acting nuclear level.
