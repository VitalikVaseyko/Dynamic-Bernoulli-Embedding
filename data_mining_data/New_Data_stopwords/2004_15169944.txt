 C(4) succulent plant Portulaca oleracea shifts photosynthetic metabolism crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) 23 withholding water. accounted diurnal acid fluctuation, net nocturnal day CO(2) uptake drastic changes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) kinetic regulatory properties [Lara et al. (2003) Photosynth: Res. 77: 241]. goal present work characterize CAM activity leaves P. oleracea water stress study enzymes involved carbon fixation carbohydrate metabolism. drought stress, general decrease photosynthetic metabolism, accounted decrease net CO(2) fixation activity enzymes ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, PEPC, pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase NAD-malic enzyme observed. also found changes day/night activities level immunoreactive protein enzymes correlated night CO(2) fixation, occurs CAM metabolism. Based results obtained, including situ immunolocalization studies, propose scheme possible CO(2) fixation pathways used P. oleracea conditions sufficient limiting water supply.
