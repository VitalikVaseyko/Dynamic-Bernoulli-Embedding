 Cyanate, equilibrium urea, combines alpha-amino group aminoterminal valine hemoglobin irreversible, specific carbamylation reaction. Partial carbamylation (0.72 residues/hemoglobin tetramer) determined cyanate-(14)C incorporation hydantoin analysis diminishes vitro sickling phenomenon. Since cyanate may react hemoglobin also functional groups red blood cell proteins, vitro effect cyanate studied sickle cells. Cells incubated 10 mM KCl (control) 10 mM KNCO (carbamylated) 1 hr, washed, resuspended autologous plasma. Glycolysis, ATP 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (DPG) stability, autohemolysis, osmotic fragility affected carbamylation. Potassium loss carbamylated cells (2.8 mmol/liter) less control cells (9.0 mmol/liter). Pyruvate kinase activity carbamylated cells decreased ( approximately 25%) activities glycolytic enzymes similar control cells. Oxygen affinity carbamylated sickle, normal, DPG-depleted normal cells increased, sensitive index degree duration reaction cyanate. reactivity carbamylated cells DPG similar control cells. DPG-depleted carbamylated cells regenerated DPG increased P(50) incubated pyruvate, inosine, phosphate. Bohr effect normal sickle cells affected (Deltalog P(50)/Delta pH=-0.48 -0.53, respectively) carbamylation. reserve buffering capacity plasma offset slightly diminished ( approximately 15%) CO(2) capacity carbamylated cells whole blood CO(2) capacity, pH, P(CO2) normal. studies provide support potential clinical use cyanate treating preventing anemia painful crises sickle cell disease.
