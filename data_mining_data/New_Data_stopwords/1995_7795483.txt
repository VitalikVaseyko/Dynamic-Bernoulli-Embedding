 Two main hormones regulate water balance amphibian. First, mesotocin (MT) acting diuretic agent, second arginine vasotocin (AVT) anti-diuretic hormone. addition, prolactin (PRL), aldosterone, corticosterone, angiotensin II atriunatriuretic hormones, play role regulating water ion balance. hormones affect epidermis bladder permeability water ions well kidney control glomerular filtration rate (GFR). main questions concern presence action hormones amphibian's life history. present larval adult stages? hormones synthesized aquatic terrestrial adult phases? circumstances stored released? Would target organs (epidermis, bladder, kidney) respond similar way periods? problem fact circumstances amphibian aquatic environment responds physiologically differently land. partial information concerning hormone presence, release control water balance available moment, even fragmentary based small number amphibian species.
