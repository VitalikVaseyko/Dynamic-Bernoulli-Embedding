 NADPH oxidases important sources reactive oxygen species (ROS) act signaling molecules regulation protein expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration cell death. NOX1 subunit over-expressed several cancers NOX1 derived ROS repeatedly linked tumorigenesis tumor progression although underlying pathways ill defined. engineered NOX1-depleted HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells employed differential display 2DE experiments order investigate changes NOX1-dependent protein expression profiles. total 17 protein functions identified dysregulated NOX1-depleted cells. proteomic results support connection NOX1 Warburg effect role NOX regulation glucose glutamine metabolism well lipid, protein nucleotide synthesis hepatic tumor cells. Metabolic remodeling common feature tumor cells understanding underlying mechanisms essential development new cancer treatments. results reveal manifold involvement NOX1 metabolic remodeling hepatoblastoma cells towards sustained production building blocks required maintain high proliferative rate, thus rendering NOX1 potential target cancer therapy.
