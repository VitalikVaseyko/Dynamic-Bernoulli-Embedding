 Rat heart mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate (in presence 20% much malate) took nearly amount oxygen required complete oxidation CO2. Thus pyruvate, physiological substrate citrate cycle, oxidized entire cycle mitochondria, seem suitable study regulation integrated mitochondrial energy transduction. addition graded amounts hexokinase pyruvate kinase suspending medium (in presence excess glucose phosphoenolpyruvate), wide range steady-state values ATP/ADP concentration ratio obtained. constant concentration phosphate, steady-state rate oxygen uptake rat heart mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate function adenylate energy charge ATP/ADP ratio, relatively independent absolute concentrations nucleotides. oxygen uptake rates typically spanned range 20-fold. high values ATP/ADP ratio, rate oxygen uptake much lower "state 4" rate seen added ADP phosphorylated. result suggests "state 4" respiration, least freshly prepared mitochondria, measures rate ADP made available ATPase activity, rather indicating uncoupling electron transport phosphorylation. concentration orthophosphate affected rate oxygen uptake pattern response ATP/ADP ratio energy charge, effects seem interpretable terms mass-action expression hydrolysis ATP, (ATP)/ (ADP) (Pi).
