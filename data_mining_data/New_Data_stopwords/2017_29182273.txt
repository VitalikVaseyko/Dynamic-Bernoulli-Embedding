 Pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) catalyzes terminal step glycolysis, transferring phosphoryl group phosphoenolpyruvate ADP, produce pyruvate ATP. PKM2 activity allosterically regulated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), upstream glycolytic intermediate. FBP stabilizes tetrameric form enzyme. absence, PKM2 tetramers dissociate, yielding dimer-monomer mixture lower enzymatic activity. S437Y variant PKM2 incapable binding FBP. Consistent defect, find S437Y exists monomer-dimer equilibrium solution, Kd approximately 20 muM. Interestingly, however, protein crystallizes tetramer, providing insight structural basis impaired FBP binding S437Y.
