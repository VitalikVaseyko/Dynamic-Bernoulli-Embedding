 Enhanced glycolysis cancer, called Warburg effect, well-known feature cancer metabolism. Recent advances revealed Warburg effect coupled many cancer properties, including adaptation hypoxia low nutrients, immortalisation, resistance oxidative stress apoptotic stimuli, elevated biomass synthesis. linkages mediated various oncogenic molecules signals, c-Myc, p53, insulin/Ras pathway. Furthermore, several regulators glycolysis recently identified oncogene candidates, including hypoxia-inducible factor pathway, sirtuins, adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase, glycolytic pyruvate kinase M2, phosphoglycerate mutase, oncometabolites. interplay glycolysis oncogenic events focus review.
