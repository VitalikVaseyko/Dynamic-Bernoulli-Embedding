 Owing rarity adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) prognostic markers established beyond stage resection status. Accelerated glycolysis characteristic feature cancer cells variety tumour entities key factors glucose metabolism like glucose transporter 1 3 (GLUT1 -3), transketolase like-1 enzyme (TKTL1) pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK) overexpressed prognostic value. Therefore, investigated role factors ACC. Immunohistochemical analysis performed tissue microarrays paraffin-embedded tissue samples 167 ACCs, 15 adrenal adenomas 4 normal adrenal glands. Expression correlated baseline parameters clinical outcome. GLUT1 -3 expressed 33 17% ACC samples respectively, none benign tumours normal adrenals glands. contrast, TKTL1 M2-PK detectable benign tissues vast majority ACCs. GLUT1 expression strongly associated prognosis univariate multivariate analysis (P<0.01), whereas GLUT3, TKTL1 M2-PK correlate clinical outcome. Patients strong GLUT1 staining showed considerably higher overall mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 6.34 (95% confidence interval 3.10-12.90) compared patients GLUT1 staining. analysing patients early stages advanced disease separately, similar results obtained. HR survival 5.31 (1.80-15.62) patients metastatic ACC patients radical resection HR disease-free survival 6.10 (2.16-16.94). conclusion, GLUT1 highly promising stage-independent, prognostic marker ACC.
