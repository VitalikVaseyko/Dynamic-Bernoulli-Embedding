 Pancreatic islet beta cells regulate rate insulin gene transcription response number nutrients, potent glucose. test regulation glucose, promoter sequence isolated human insulin gene. linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transfected primary islet cultures, human insulin promoter activated glucose. parallel islet transfections, glucose also activates L-pyruvate kinase islet amyloid chain ketoacid dehydrogenase E1a promoter, affect beta cell glucose kinase promoter. Using deletion substitution mutations proximal human insulin promoter, mapped metabolic response element E box, E1, -100 base pairs relative transcription start site. Although isolated E1 element responds glucose, inclusion either two AT-rich sequences, A1 A2/C1 either side E1, results dramatic synergistic activation. Inclusion A2/C1 also increases response glucose. A2-E1-A1 region alone, however, explain activity human insulin promoter cultured islets, transcriptionally important elements likely contribute glucose response well.
