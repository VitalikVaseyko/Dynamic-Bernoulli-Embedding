 OBJECTIVE: Based proteomic reference map important probiotic organism Bifidobacteria longum NCC2705 constructed previous research, compared proteomic profiles Bifidobacteria longum strain NCC2705 grown lactose glucose identify catabolic route allowing lactose fermentation. METHODS: considered proteins differentially expressed relative volume deviated 3-fold ImageMaster 2D Elite version 5.0 software. Interesting spots identified matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis, phosphorylation analysis proteins mobility changes Pro-Q Diamond Stain. RESULTS: identified spots represent 31 protein entries, 14 up-regulated proteins, 17 down-regulated proteins. identified proteins, hydrophilic proteins genes CAI value 0.5 represented abundant proteins, included key stress proteins, metabolism-related proteins, proteins related translation. Two proteins including Tal (BL0715, transaldolase, L3) Pyk (BL0988, pyruvate kinase, G9) exhibited clear post-translational modification. CONCLUSION: Proteomic comparison glucose- lactose-grown cells revealed lactose glucose catabolized via degradation pathway, rate glucose assimilation higher lactose. Spot protein analysis revealed post-translational modifications might common proteins. Pro-Q Diamond staining analysis revealed lactose trigger Tal phosphorylation 43 /47 S, inhibited Pyk phosphorylation 65 S. proteins identified first time bifidobacterial phosphoproteins.
