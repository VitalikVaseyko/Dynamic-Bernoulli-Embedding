 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) cDNA cloned brain greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). deduced amino acid sequence shares strong homology PDK4 mammals. Moreover, partially cloned homologues dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated regulated protein kinase 1A (DYRK1A), forkhead box protein O1A (FOXO1A) greater horseshoe bat. Among five different tissues tested, PDK4 mRNA highly expressed heart, white adipose tissue muscle, weakly expressed brain liver, DYRK1A FOXO1A expressed five tissues. Moreover, transcript levels PDK4, DYRK1A, FOXO1A measured heart, white adipose tissue muscle hibernating arousal greater horseshoe bats Northern blot real time PCR. results showed transcript level PDK4 significantly higher white adipose tissue. Expression level DYRK1A significantly higher hibernating state white adipose tissue, expression level FOXO1A significantly higher muscle aroused state. results suggest up-regulation transcript levels PDK4 hibernation regulated via DYRK1A FOXO1A white adipose tissue muscle, possible presence another isoenzyme PDK responsible tissue-specific regulation Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity bat heart hibernation.
