 disinfection drinking water major public health achievement. However, haloacetic acids (HAAs), generated byproducts water disinfection, cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic. Previous studies monoHAA-induced genotoxicity cell stress demonstrated toxicity due inhibition glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), leading disruption cellular metabolism energy homeostasis. DiHAAs triHAAs also produced water disinfection, whether share mechanisms action monoHAAs unknown. study, evaluated effects mono-, di-, tri-HAAs cellular GAPDH enzyme kinetics, cellular ATP levels, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity. Here, treatments conducted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells revealed differences among mono-, di-, triHAAs molecular targets. monoHAAs, iodoacetic acid bromoacetic acid, strongest inhibitors GAPDH greatly reduced cellular ATP levels. Chloroacetic acid, diHAAs, triHAAs weaker inhibitors GAPDH increased levels cellular ATP. HAAs also affected PDC activity, HAAs activating PDC. primary finding work mono- versus multi-HAAs address different molecular targets, results generally consistent model monoHAAs activate PDC GAPDH inhibition-mediated disruption cellular metabolites, including altering ATP-to-ADP NADH-to-NAD ratios. monoHAA-mediated reduction cellular metabolites results accelerated PDC activity way metabolite-ratio-dependent PDC regulation. DiHAAs triHAAs weaker inhibitors GAPDH, many also increase cellular ATP levels, suggest increase PDC activity inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.
