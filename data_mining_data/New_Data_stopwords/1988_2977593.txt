 hepatocytes isolated fed rats incubated either basal conditions presence glucagon, tolbutamide reduced gluconeogenesis (U-14C) pyruvate increasing cellular concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Furthermore, sulfonylurea enhanced inhibitory action insulin glucagon-stimulated gluconeogenesis; effect accompanied marked increase cellular concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate elicited either insulin sulfonylurea alone. connection this, tolbutamide--without significant modification cellular cyclic AMP levels--raised proportion 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase active form hepatocytes incubated either basal conditions presence glucagon, reinforced action insulin antagonizing glucagon-mediated inactivation enzyme.
