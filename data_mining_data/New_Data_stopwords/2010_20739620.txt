 Fatty acid reesterification adipose tissue dependent generation glycerol 3-phosphate, and, least rodent adipose tissue, appears occur primarily glyceroneogenesis. key enzyme process pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). PDK4 induced white adipose tissue thiazolidinediones (TZDs) inhibition knockdown PDK4 inhibits TZD-induced increases glyceroneogenesis. Since TZDs many unwanted side effects, interested identifying alternative mechanisms could regulate PDK4 mRNA expression white adipose tissue. regard hypothesized exercise, fasting, epinephrine would increase PDK4 mRNA levels rat epididymal adipose tissue. postulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways would control PDK4 mRNA expression cultured adipose tissue. Exercise, fasting, ex vivo epinephrine treatment increased PDK4 mRNA levels. perturbations increase expression PDK1, -2, -3. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation increased overnight fast 4 h cessation exercise. cultured adipose tissue, epinephrine increased p38 AMPK signaling; however, direct activation AMPK AICAR metformin led reductions PDK4 mRNA levels. p38 inhibitor SB202190 reduced epinephrine-mediated increases p38 MAPK activation without altering hormone-sensitive lipase AMPK phosphorylation attenuating epinephrine-induced increases lipolysis. Reductions p38 MAPK signaling associated decreases PDK4 mRNA expression. inhibition peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) also attenuated induction PDK4. results first demonstrate epinephrine-mediated regulation PDK4 mRNA levels white adipose tissue suggest p38 MAPK PPARgamma could involved pathway.
