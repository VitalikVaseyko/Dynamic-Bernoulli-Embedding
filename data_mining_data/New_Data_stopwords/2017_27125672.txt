 Alternative splicing Pkm gene product generates PKM1 PKM2 isoforms pyruvate kinase (PK), PKM2 expression closely linked embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, cancer. interrogate functional requirement PKM2 development tissue homeostasis, generated germline PKM2-null mice (Pkm2(-/-)). Unexpectedly, despite primary isoform expressed wild-type adult tissues, found Pkm2(-/-) mice viable fertile. Thus, PKM2 required embryonic postnatal development. Loss PKM2 leads compensatory expression PKM1 tissues normally express PKM2. Strikingly, PKM2 loss leads spontaneous development hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) high penetrance accompanied progressive changes systemic metabolism characterized altered systemic glucose homeostasis, inflammation, hepatic steatosis. Therefore, addition role cancer metabolism, PKM2 plays role controlling systemic metabolic homeostasis inflammation, thereby preventing HCC non-cell-autonomous mechanism.
