 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Microorganisms Peptostreptococcus micros asaccharolytic, anaerobic gram-positive cocci frequently isolated human oral sites periodontal pockets. Preliminary study showed several amino acids, including serine, enhanced slightly growth P. micros. Therefore, investigated degradation serine serine-containing oligopeptides. METHODS: Metabolic end products determined high-performance liquid chromatography. related enzymatic activities cell-free extract also assayed. RESULTS: Washed P. micros degraded serine-tripeptides (Ser-Ser-Ser), produced formate, pyruvate, acetate, ammonia. also degraded serinyl-tyrosine (Ser-Tyr) products. Related enzymatic activities, serine dehydratase, pyruvate formate-lyase, formate dehydrogenase, pyruvate oxidoreductase, phosphate acetyltransferase, acetate kinase, detected cell-free extract, indicating organisms produced ATP serine metabolism. CONCLUSION: P. micros utilized serine-containing oligopeptides exogenous metabolic substrates rather serine itself, degraded Ser-Ser-Ser Ser-Tyr formate, pyruvate, acetate, ammonia ATP generation.
