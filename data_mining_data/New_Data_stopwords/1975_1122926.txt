 Human blood platelets contain detectable activity enzymes fructose diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11), phospho-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1.). Glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) activity low. Phosphofructokinase present human blood platelets, catalyzes reaction stimulated AMP platelet homogenate, due presence endogenous ADP myokinase. enzymes responsible formation fructose-6-phosphate fructose-1, 6-diphosphate. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) human blood platelets belongs M-type, inhibited ATP, least conditions applied. results obtained indicate gluconeogenesis human blood platelets present way established liver kidney.
