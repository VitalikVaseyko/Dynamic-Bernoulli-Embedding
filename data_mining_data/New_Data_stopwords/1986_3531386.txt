 Twenty four hour urine samples male control streptozotocin-diabetic Wistar rats analysed series commonly known kidney-specific enzymes, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, total protein urine volume. examination done two periods 5 days 25th 30th 32nd 36th day streptozotocin application. first period animals free access food water, whereas second period days 32, 34 36 food withdrawn. first observation period diabetic rats showed increased excretion rates 15 measured urinary parameters, alanine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.1.2) gamma-glutamyltransferase (EC 2.3.2.2) activities lowered inorganic phosphate unchanged. removal food resulted decreased excretion values alanine aminopeptidase, gamma-glutamyltransferase total protein compared fasted nondiabetic animals. activities N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.30), acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), C1-fructose 1.6-diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) excretion values sodium, calcium, magnesium, chloride glucose higher fasted nondiabetic rats. beta-Glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), potassium, inorganic phosphate, creatinine, urine volume showed differences fasted diabetic fasted control animals. enzymes renal cortex end experiment showed decreased activity alanine aminopeptidase diabetic rats. Lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, beta-glucosidase, C1-fructose 1.6-diphosphatase glucose 6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) showed change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
