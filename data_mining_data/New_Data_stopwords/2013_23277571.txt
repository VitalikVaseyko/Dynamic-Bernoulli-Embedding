 Regulation metabolic operation response extracellular cues crucial cells' survival. Next canonical nutrient sensors, measure concentration nutrients, recently intracellular "metabolic flux" proposed novel impetus metabolic regulation. According concept, cells would molecular systems ("flux sensors") place regulate metabolism function actually occurring metabolic fluxes. Although resembles appealing concept, experimental evidence existence flux sensors also known flux sensors would work detail. Here, show experimental evidence supports hypothesis Escherichia coli indeed able measure glycolytic flux uses signal metabolic regulation. Combining experiment theory, show flux-sensing function could emerge aggregate several molecular mechanisms: First, system reactions lower glycolysis feedforward activation fructose-1,6-bisphosphate pyruvate kinase translate flux information concentration metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. interaction "flux-signaling metabolite" transcription factor Cra leads flux-dependent regulation. responding glycolytic flux, rather concentration individual carbon sources, cell may minimize sensing regulatory expenses.
