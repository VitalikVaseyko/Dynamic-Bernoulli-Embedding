 Lipids actively involved many cellular processes. roles pivot toward determining membrane structure, compartment targeting, membrane fusion also regulation cell signaling via interactions proteins production second messengers. play key role cell signaling, study protein-protein interaction protein conformation change relationship interaction lipids major importance. recently, ability detect situ real time dynamics various biological events signals without perturbing cellular environment real challenge. However, emergence fluorescence imaging cells tissues allowed dynamic aspects cell investigated physiological context disassembled model systems employed traditional biochemical analysis. chapter highlights many biological applications uses frequency- time-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) applied detection Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). first part describes FRET system, second part discusses study FLIM, third part describes application methods panel biological questions (1) spatio-temporal interaction protein kinase B (PKB) 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), (2) PKB conformation change, (3) dynamics PKB activation, (4) interaction phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) phospholipase (PLD) lipids.
