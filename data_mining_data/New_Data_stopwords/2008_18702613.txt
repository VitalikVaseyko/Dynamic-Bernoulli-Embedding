 Acute insulin-releasing actions amino acids studied detail, comparatively little known beta-cell effects long-term exposure amino acids. present study examined effects prolonged exposure beta-cells metabolizable amino acid L-alanine. Basal insulin release cellular insulin content significantly altered alanine culture, acute alanine-induced insulin secretion suppressed 74% (P<0.001). Acute stimulation insulin secretion glucose, KCl KIC (2-oxoisocaproic acid) following alanine culture affected. Acute alanine exposure evoked strong cellular depolarization control culture, whereas AUC (area curve) analysis revealed significant (P<0.01) suppression action culture alanine. Compared control cells, prior exposure alanine also markedly decreased (P<0.01) acute elevation [Ca(2+)](i) (intracellular [Ca(2+)]) induced acute alanine exposure. diminished stimulatory responses partially restored 18 h culture absence alanine, indicating reversible amino-acid-induced desensitization. (13)C NMR spectra revealed alanine culture increased glutamate labelling position C4 (by 60%; P<0.01), result increase singlet peak, indicating increased flux pyruvate dehydrogenase. Consistent this, protein expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases PDK2 PDK4 significantly reduced. accompanied decrease cellular ATP (P<0.05), consistent diminished insulin-releasing actions amino acid. Collectively, results illustrate phenomenon beta-cell desensitization amino acids, indicating prolonged exposure alanine induce reversible alterations metabolic flux, Ca(2+) handling insulin secretion.
