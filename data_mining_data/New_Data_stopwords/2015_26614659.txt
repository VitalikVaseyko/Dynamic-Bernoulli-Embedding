 producing ATP, tumour cells rely glycolysis leading lactate extent respiration. Thus, ATP synthesis flux glycolysis considerably higher corresponding healthy cells. known Warburg effect (named German biochemist Otto H. Warburg) also applies striated muscle cells, activated lymphocytes, microglia, endothelial cells several cell types. similar phenomena several yeasts many bacteria, terms Crabtree effect overflow metabolism respectively, used. Warburg effect paradoxical first sight molar ATP yield glycolysis much lower respiration. Although straightforward explanation glycolysis allows higher ATP production rate, question arises cells re-allocate protein high-yield pathway respiration. Mathematical modelling help explain phenomenon. Here, review several models various scales proposed literature explaining Warburg effect. models support hypothesis glycolysis allows higher proliferation rate due increased ATP production precursor supply rates.
