 activity 22 enzymes energy metabolism determined m. vastus lateralis quadricipitis 14 adolescents aged 13-15 years (7 girls) 14 adults aged 22 42 years (7 female subjects). measurements performed kinetically, 37 degrees C, using optimal near-to-optimal procedures. exception one enzyme, enolase, differences sexes observed two age groups. Glycolytic enzymes, including fructose-6-phosphate kinase, showed significant differences activity adults compared adolescents. activity enolase lower females age groups, difference due age found respect. oxidative enzymes studied, citrate synthase showed significant difference adults vs adolescents, whereas activities lipoamide dehydrogenase (+ 40%), NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase (+ 44%), fumarase (+ 24.5%), total malate dehydrogenase (+ 42.2%) NADH-dehydrogenase (+ 39%) significantly higher latter group. Aspartate aminotransferase also 44% higher adolescents. possible physiological importance observations discussed regard functional capacity skeletal muscle. hypothesis considered adolescents age may glycolytic capacity comparable adults, may oxidize pyruvate rate higher adults.
