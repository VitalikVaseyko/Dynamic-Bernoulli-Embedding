 Dietary polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) reduce hepatic content SREBP-1 65-75%, paralleled comparable decrease expression fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene. close association nuclear content SREBP-1 FAS transcription led conclusion PUFA inhibit lipogenic gene transcription suppressing SREBP-1 expression, conclusion based upon correlative data. fact SREBP-1/USF sites insulin response element FAS mutated, 25% PUFA inhibition FAS promoter activity lost. hand, mutating -99/-93 NF-Y site reduced overall promoter activity 85%, eliminated 50% PUFA suppression FAS promoter activity. addition, extended cloning transfection-reporter assays revealed FAS gene contains second PUFA response region (PUFA-RR) distal area -7382/-6970. Interestingly, distal PUFA-RR(FAS) many similarities PUFA-RR l-pyruvate kinase gene proximal PUFA-RR(FAS) comparable PUFA-RR S14 stearoyl-CoA desaturase genes.
