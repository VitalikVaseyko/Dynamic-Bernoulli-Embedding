 Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase plays important role erythrocyte metabolism. Mutation gene results pyruvate kinase deficiency important cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. difficulties isolating mutant enzymes patients, mutations fully studied. study, complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase generated. cDNA cloned several expression vectors, protein expressed purified. tetrameric protein exhibited properties characteristic authentic human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase, including response substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, activation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, inhibition adenosine triphosphate (ATP). N-terminal segment protein highly susceptible proteolysis, 2 4 subunits cleaved lacked 47 N-terminal amino acid residues. mutant protein, R510Q, frequently occurring mutation among Northern European population, also generated purified. mutant protein retained binding capacity could activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate showed similar kinetics toward phosphoenolpyruvate adenosine diphosphate wild-type enzyme. Conversely, mutant protein dramatically decreased stability toward heat susceptible ATP inhibition. enzyme instability decreases enzyme level cell, accounting clinically observed "pyruvate kinase deficiency" patients homozygous mutation. study provides first detailed functional characterization human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase. findings allow establishment fine correlation molecular abnormalities clinical expression disease.
