 global escalation antibiotic resistance cases means alternative antimicrobials essential. aim study investigate antimicrobial capacity apple cider vinegar (ACV) E. coli, S. aureus C. albicans. minimum dilution ACV required growth inhibition varied microbial species. C. albicans, 1/2 ACV strongest effect, S. aureus, 1/25 dilution ACV required, whereas E-coli cultures, 1/50 ACV dilution required (p < 0.05). Monocyte co-culture microbes alongside ACV resulted dose dependent downregulation inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-6). Results expressed percentage decreases cytokine secretion comparing ACV treated non-ACV treated monocytes cultured E-coli (TNFalpha, 99.2%; IL-6, 98%), S. aureus (TNFalpha, 90%; IL-6, 83%) C. albicans (TNFalpha, 83.3%; IL-6, 90.1%) respectively. Proteomic analyses microbes demonstrated ACV impaired cell integrity, organelles protein expression. ACV treatment resulted absence expression DNA starvation protein, citrate synthase, isocitrate malate dehydrogenases E-coli; chaperone protein DNak ftsz S. aureus pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, fructose bisphosphate among enzymes absent C.albican cultures. results demonstrate ACV multiple antimicrobial potential clinical therapeutic implications.
