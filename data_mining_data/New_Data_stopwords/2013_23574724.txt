 role PPARgamma cancer therapy controversial, studies showing either pro-tumorigenic antineoplastic effects. debate clinically relevant, PPARgamma agonists used antidiabetic drugs. Here, evaluated effects PPARgamma tumorigenesis determined cell type PPARgamma activated. Second, examined metabolic changes induced PPARgamma, glycolysis autophagy, play role tumorigenic process. end, PPARgamma overexpressed breast cancer cells stromal cells. PPARgamma-overexpressing cells examined respect (1) tumorigenic potential, using xenograft models, (2) regarding metabolic features. xenograft models, show PPARgamma activated cancer cells, tumor growth inhibited 40%. However, PPARgamma activated stromal cells, growth co-injected breast cancer cells enhanced 60%. Thus, effect(s) PPARgamma tumorigenesis dependent cell compartment PPARgamma activated. Mechanistically, stromal cells activated PPARgamma display metabolic features cancer-associated fibroblasts, increased autophagy, glycolysis senescence. Indeed, fibroblasts overexpressing PPARgamma show increased expression autophagic markers, increased numbers acidic autophagic vacuoles, increased production L-lactate, cell hypertrophy mitochondrial dysfunction. addition, PPARgamma fibroblasts show increased expression CDKs (p16/p21) beta-galactosidase, markers cell cycle arrest senescence. Finally, PPARgamma induces activation two major transcription factors promote autophagy glycolysis, i.e., HIF-1alpha NFkappaB, stromal cells. Thus, PPARgamma activation stromal cells results formation catabolic pro-inflammatory microenvironment metabolically supports cancer growth. Interestingly, tumor inhibition observed PPARgamma expressed epithelial cancer cells also associated increased autophagy, suggesting activation autophagic program pro- antitumorigenic effects depending cell compartment occurs. Finally, PPARgamma expressed epithelial cancer cells, suppression tumor growth associated modest inhibition angiogenesis. conclusion, data support "two-compartment tumor metabolism" model, proposes metabolic coupling exists catabolic stromal cells oxidative cancer cells. Cancer cells induce autophagy, glycolysis senescence stromal cells. return, stromal cells generate onco-metabolites mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate, ketones, glutamine/aminoacids fatty acids) used cancer cells enhance tumorigenic potential. Thus, researchers design new therapies, must conscious cancer cell-autonomous disease, rather tumor ecosystem many different cell types, engage metabolic symbiosis.
