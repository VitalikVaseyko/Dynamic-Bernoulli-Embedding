 1. aerial exposure, pyruvate kinase inactivated various organs M. edulis; decrease activity slower muscle non-muscular tissue. 2. Anoxic vitro incubation gills results rapid inactivation pyruvate kinase. change occurs aerated medium. 3. Enzyme inactivation mimicked part oxic incubation acidified medium containing 5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione, action calcium ionophore A23187. 4. Incubation supernatant gill homogenate results slow inactivation pyruvate kinase inhibited trifluoperazine EGTA stimulated exogenous calmodulin. 5. Addition ATP plus cAMP stimulates pyruvate kinase inactivation supernatant homogenized muscle high molecular weight fraction thereof.
