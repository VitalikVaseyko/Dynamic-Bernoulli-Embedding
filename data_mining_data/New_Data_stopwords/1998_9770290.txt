 enzymic interconversion Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) catalytically active inactive forms mediated activities ICDH-kinase/phosphatase response changes metabolic environment. study, use mutant strains devoid isocitrate lyase (aceA:: Tn10) pyruvate dehydrogenase activities revealed signal triggers reversible inactivation ICDH vivo directly related acetate itself, rather need maintain high intracellular levels isocitrate free co-enzyme A. use mutants also revealed, rather unexpectedly, acetate grown cells contain ICDH protein grown carbon sources catalytic activity ICDH kinase/phosphatase excess cellular demands. Furthermore, study also revealed presence 50-kDa (+/- 2 kDa) acetate-specific polypeptide, identity yet established.
