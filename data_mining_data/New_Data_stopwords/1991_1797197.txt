 Lonidamine (LND) new drug interferes mitochondrial functions, thereby inhibiting cellular oxygen consumption energy metabolism normal neoplastic cells. metabolic actions LND seem increase cytotoxic effect antitumor agents doxorubicin (Dx). Dx widely used antitumor agent, specific cardiac toxicity develops critical cumulative dose major limiting factor long term use. far, nothing known possible synergic action LND Dx metabolism cardiac cells. purpose study verify experimental model vivo, whether LND could increase toxicity Dx rat heart. Groups consisting 10 female Wistar rats (weighing 100-150 g) injected ip single dose Dx (10 mg/kg), LDN (50 mg/kg), Dx plus LND dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (ratio LND:DMSO = 1/10). 24 h, oxygen uptake (QO2) intracellular concentrations ATP GTP indices cardiac metabolic impairment, measured heart slices Warburg apparatus high-pressure liquid chromatography. Dx, significantly (p less 0.01), reduced QO2 (34%) intracellular concentration ATP GTP (32-57%). LND alone partially reduced cardiac QO2 (23%) intracellular ATP-GTP concentration (16-31%). contrast, combination two agents enhance Dx-related metabolic cardiac toxicity.
