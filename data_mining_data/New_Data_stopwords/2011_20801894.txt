 study undertaken elucidate effects dietary protein deprivation glucose metabolism hepatic insulin signaling rats. results glucose pyruvate tolerance tests rats fed 12% casein diet (12C) protein-free diet (PF) indicated protein deprivation enhanced clearance blood glucose suppressed gluconeogenesis. Correspondingly, mRNA level hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, key gluconeogenic enzyme, suppressed dietary protein deprivation. PF-fed rats, total tyrosine phosphorylation insulin receptor (IR) liver induced insulin injection enhanced compared 12C pair-fed rats due increase IR protein level. addition, protein deprivation caused increase protein levels IR substrate 1 (IRS1) IRS2, leading marked enhancement insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation IRS2 binding p85 regulatory subunit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Based results, conclude protein deprivation suppresses gluconeogenesis mechanism primarily mediated enhancement insulin signals IR/IRS/PI3K/mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 pathway liver. Taken together previous report, findings suggest tissue-specific potentiation insulin action liver skeletal muscle plays important roles maintaining glucose homeostasis even energy usage reduced dietary protein deprivation.
