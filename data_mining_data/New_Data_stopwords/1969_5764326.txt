 Cells Staphylococcus aureus MF-31 heat-injured 52 C altered metabolic activity. Analyses whole-cell preparations means Thunberg technique Warburg manometry showed decreased dehydrogenase activity oxygen uptake variety substrates. cell-free extracts prepared injured cells, demonstrated specific activity fructose diphosphate aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, butanediol dehydrogenase less extracts prepared normal unheated cells. Recovery heat-injured cells suitable medium supported return dehydrogenase activity oxygen uptake, activity enzymes cell-free extracts prepared partially recovered cells fully return level normal (unheated) preparations. Addition chloramphenicol actinomycin recovery medium, singly combination, retarded return normal metabolic activity. Radiorespirometric experiments indicated percentage participation Embden-Meyerhoff Parnas hexose monophosphate pathways remained normal heat-injured cells. sublethal heat treatment decreased catabolic capabilities S. aureus production selected end products associated metabolism glucose.
