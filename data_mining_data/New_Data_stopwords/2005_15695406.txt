 Cancer cells generally exhibit increased glycolysis ATP generation (the Warburg effect) due part mitochondrial respiration injury hypoxia, frequently associated resistance therapeutic agents. Here, report inhibition glycolysis severely depletes ATP cancer cells, especially clones cancer cells mitochondrial respiration defects, leads rapid dephosphorylation glycolysis-apoptosis integrating molecule BAD Ser(112), relocalization BAX mitochondria, massive cell death. Importantly, inhibition glycolysis effectively kills colon cancer cells lymphoma cells hypoxic environment cancer cells exhibit high glycolytic activity decreased sensitivity common anticancer agents. Depletion ATP glycolytic inhibition also potently induced apoptosis multidrug-resistant cells, suggesting deprivation cellular energy supply may effective way overcome multidrug resistance. study shows promising therapeutic strategy effectively kill cancer cells overcome drug resistance. Warburg effect hypoxia frequently seen human cancers, findings may broad clinical implications.
