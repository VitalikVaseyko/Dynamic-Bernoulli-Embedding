 1. Preincubation partially purified rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase 25 degrees 10min. causes marked increase co-operativity respect substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, allosteric activator, fructose 1,6-diphosphate. 2. results consistent existence two forms liver L-type pyruvate kinase, designated forms L(A) L(B). postulated form L(A) low K(m) phosphoenolpyruvate (about 0.1mm) allosterically activated, whereas form L(B) allosterically activated fructose 1,6-diphosphate, exhibiting absence activator sigmoidal kinetics half-maximal activity 1mm-phosphoenolpyruvate. presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate, form L(B) gives Michaelis-Menten kinetics K(m) less 0.1mm. postulated preincubation converts form L(A) form L(B). 3. influence pH preincubation effect studied. 4. inhibition pyruvate kinase Cu(2+) studied detail. Though phosphoenolpyruvate fructose 1,6-diphosphate readily protect enzyme Cu(2+) inhibition, little evidence significant reversal inhibition compounds could found. 5. effects starvation, fructose feeding preincubation pyruvate kinase activity crude homogenates various tissues rat also studied.
