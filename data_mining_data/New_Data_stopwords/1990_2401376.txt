 1. activity pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carbonoxykinase pyruvate carboxylase measured muscle tissue. 2. enzyme assays critically evaluated. 3. Muscle tissue possesses residual activities pyruvate carboxylase PEP carboxykinase. 4. pyruvate kinase activity significantly lowered 24 hr fast. 5. Malic enzyme activity increased fast.
