 Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis. phenomenon, known Warburg effect, characteristic glucose metabolism cancer cells. PKM2 reported imply important role glycolysis. However, whether PKM2 cause mitochondrial dysfunction, subsequently forcing cancer cells using glycolysis instead oxidation phosphorylation poorly understood. reported overexpression PKM2 disrupted mitochondrial dynamics enhancing fusion. PKM2 overexpression increased expression fusion protein Mfn2. Simultaneously, PKM2 overexpression induced mitochondrial dysfunctions shown decreased ATP level increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Reduction Mfn2 expression siRNA attenuated PKM2-enhanced mitochondrial fusion restored functions. Quantitative morphological analyses showed expression microRNA-106b (miR-106b) decreased PKM2 overexpressed cells, reduction Mfn2 expression recovery mitochondrial functions induced treatment miR-106b mimics, demonstrating miR-106b played important roles down-regulation Mfn2 expression PKM2 mediation mitochondrial fusion. Clinical investigation performed results showed higher expression levels PKM2 corresponded higher expression levels Mfn2 breast cancer tissues comparison expression adjacent normal tissues. Taken together, data demonstrate overexpression PKM2 Mfn2 causes mitochondrial dysfunction via enhancing mitochondrial fusion miR-106b play crucial roles PKM2 mediated mitochondrial function regulation Mfn2 expression, provides new insights molecular mechanisms underlying glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation.
