 BACKGROUND: Accumulating preclinical clinical evidence implicates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) acquired resistance anticancer drugs; however, mechanisms mesenchymal state determines drug resistance remain unknown. RESULTS: explore potential role altered cellular metabolism EMT associated drug resistance, analyzed metabolome transcriptome three lung cancer cell lines rendered drug resistant following experimental induction EMT. analysis revealed evidence metabolic rewiring EMT diverts glucose TCA cycle. rewiring least partially mediated reduced expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), serves gatekeeper TCA cycle inactivating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Overexpression PDK4 partially blocked TGFbeta-induced EMT; conversely, PDK4 inhibition via RNAi-mediated knockdown sufficient drive EMT promoted erlotinib resistance EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. identified novel interaction PDK4 apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), inner mitochondrial protein appears play role mediating resistance. addition, analysis human tumor samples revealed PDK4-low predictor poor prognosis lung cancer PDK4 expression dramatically downregulated tumor types. CONCLUSIONS: Together, findings implicate PDK4 critical metabolic regulator EMT associated drug resistance.
