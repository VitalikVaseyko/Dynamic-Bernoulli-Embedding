 properties pyruvate kinase soybean (Glycine max L.) nodule cytosol examined determine influence N(2) fixation process might supposed key control enzyme. crude enzyme preparation prepared chromatography cytosol extract diethylaminoethyl-cellulose column. ATP citrate 5 mm concentrations inhibited pyruvate kinase 27 34%, respectively. Enzyme activation hyperbolic respect K(+) NH(4) (+) concentrations. presence physiological concentrations K(+) high phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentrations, NH(4) (+) inhibited enzyme activity. Comparisons kinetic parameters (V(max) apparent K(a)) NH(4) (+) K(+) inhibition curves indicated inhibition likely result competition ions activation site(s) pyruvate kinase. addition, apparent K(a) (monovalent cation) K(m) (PEP) influenced PEP monovalent cation concentrations, respectively. effect may reflect fundamental difference plant animal pyruvate kinases. concluded control cytosol pyruvate kinase may closely related reactions involved assimilation NH(4) (+).
