 previously shown SIS/platelet-derived growth factor B chain contains nuclear targeting signal near C terminus. show platelet-derived growth factor chain also contains nuclear targeting signal encoded exon subject alternative splicing. sequence capable targeting nonsecreted form chain nucleus also target cytoplasmic proteins dihydrofolate reductase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, pyruvate kinase nucleus.
