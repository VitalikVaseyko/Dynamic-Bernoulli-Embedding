 membrane elastic shear modulus mu determined micropipette technique found elevated 25% 200% red blood cells (RBC) 7 patients glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) 9 patients pyruvate-kinase (PK) enzymopathies mean value normal controls. patients exhibit chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemias. negative linear correlation (r = -0.72) mu number reticulocytes obtained G-6-PD deficiencies. contrast, positive correlation (r = 0.88) found red blood cells patients PK deficiency. mechanically induced swelling RBC observed deficient cells. results discussed framework structural alterations RBC membrane due disturbed pentose-phosphate pathway diminished ATP supply glycolysis, respectively.
