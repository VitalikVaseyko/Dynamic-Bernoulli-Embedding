 Cancer cell metabolism often characterized shift oxidative glycolytic bioenergetics pathway, phenomenon known Warburg effect. miR-378( *) embedded within PPARGC1b encodes PGC-1beta, transcriptional regulator oxidative energy metabolism. show miR-378( *) expression regulated ERBB2 induces metabolic shift breast cancer cells. miR-378( *) performs function inhibiting expression two PGC-1beta partners, ERRgamma GABPA, leading reduction tricarboxylic acid cycle gene expression oxygen consumption well increase lactate production cell proliferation. situ hybridization experiments show miR-378( *) expression correlates progression human breast cancer. results identify miR-378( *) molecular switch involved orchestration Warburg effect breast cancer cells via interference well-integrated bioenergetics transcriptional pathway.
