 ATP hydrolysis activity proton pumping ATP synthase Escherichia coli isolated native membranes measured compared function ADP Pi concentration. ATP hydrolysis activity inhibited Pi half-maximal effect 140 microM, increased progressively millimolar range ADP concentration progressively decreased increasing amounts ADP trap. addition, relative extent inhibition decreased decreasing ADP. half-maximal inhibition ADP found submicromolar range, extent inhibition enhanced presence Pi. parallel measurement ATP hydrolysis activity proton pumping indicated that, rate ATP hydrolysis decreased function either ligand, rate proton pumping increased. latter showed biphasic response concentration Pi, inhibition followed initial stimulation. Similarly previously found ATP synthase Rhodobacter caspulatus [P. Turina, D. Giovannini, F. Gubellini, B.A. Melandri, Physiological ligands ADP Pi modulate degree intrinsic coupling ATP synthase photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, Biochemistry 43 (2004) 11126-11134], data indicate E. coli ATP synthase operate different degrees energetic coupling hydrolysis proton transport, modulated ADP Pi.
