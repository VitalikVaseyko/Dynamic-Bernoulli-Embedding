 Fiber type specificity expression three rat skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms (PDK1, 2, 4) determined fed 24-h fasted rats. PDK activity isoform protein mRNA contents determined white gastrocnemius (WG; fast-twitch glycolytic), red gastrocnemius (RG; fast-twitch oxidative), soleus (Sol; slow-twitch oxidative) muscles. PDK activity lower WG compared oxidative muscles (RG, Sol) fed fasted rats. PDK activities fed muscles 0.12 +/- 0.04, 0.30 +/- 0.01, 0.36 +/- 0.08 min(-1) WG, Sol, RG, respectively, increased fasted muscles (0.36 +/- 0.09, 0.68 +/- 0.18, 0.80 +/- 0.14 min(-1)). correlated increased PDK4 protein lesser extent PDK4 mRNA. PDK2 protein different fiber types fed fasted rats, PDK2 mRNA content twofold greater RG fasted rats compared fed rats. PDK1 unaltered fasting muscle types protein mRNA level, fed fasted rats much greater protein mRNA content oxidative vs. glycolytic muscles. conclusion, PDK activity PDK1 4 protein mRNA lower glycolytic vs. oxidative muscles fed fasted rats. Fasting 24 h induced two- threefold increase PDK activity mainly due increases PDK4 protein mRNA. PDK1 2 protein mRNA generally unaltered fasting fiber types, except increased PDK2 mRNA fast oxidative fibers. PDK isoforms vary greatly kinetic properties, relative proportions three fiber types given time fasting could significantly alter acute regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
