 1. Adenine nucleotide concentrations normal one day hypertrophied hearts untreated, orotic acid (OA), uridine, uracil, dihydroorotate reserpine pretreated rats measured. OA treatment increased ADP concentration 5-fold one day hypertrophied hearts. Neither uracil, uridine, dihydroorotate reserpine treatments changed ADP total adenylate concentrations one day hypertrophy. 2. adenine nucleotide ratio (ANR) 0.263 x 10(3) M-1 energy charge (0.66) lowest values OA reserpine treated one day hypertrophying hearts. temporal decline indices energy metabolism corresponded OA induced maximum stimulation contractility maximum rates protein, RNA glycogen synthesis. 3. phosphorylation state adenine nucleotides (PSAN) sensitive best predictive index cellular energy status normal hypertrophying hearts. pronounced ability OA treatment energize myocyte cytoplasm shown 9- 6-fold greater values PSAN ANR one three day hypertrophied hearts. enhanced PSAN may key factor mechanism OA induced enhancement contractile synthetic functions heart compensatory hypertrophy. 4. development myocardial hypertrophy untreated rats resulted 36% reduction cytoplasmic NAD/NADH ratio. rats treated OA redox couple hypertrophying heart oxidized increased 30% restore value range normal heart. 5. regulatory status glycolytic pathway untreated OA treated hypertrophying hearts assessed comparisons mass action ratio (MAR) equilibrium constants individual glycolytic reactions. OA induced 2.7-fold increase glycogen, UDP-glucose total uridine nucleotides hypertrophied hearts. concentrations seven ten glycolytic intermediates, including pyruvate lactate increased consequence OA treated hypertrophy. Glycolytic flux stalled, rather pathway "more open" permitting greater throughput intermediates individually increased levels selected metabolites. OA stimulated hypertrophy change canonical control glycolysis activities individual MAR values phosphofructokinase pyruvic kinase. 6.
