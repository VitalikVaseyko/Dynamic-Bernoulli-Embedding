 Patients pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) face clinically intractable disease poor survival rates, attributed exceptionally high levels metastasis. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pronounced inflammatory foci within tumor; however, immunological mechanisms promoting tumor dissemination remain unclear. well established tumors exhibit Warburg effect, preferential use glycolysis energy production, even presence oxygen, support rapid growth. hypothesized metabolic pathways utilized tumor-infiltrating macrophages altered PDAC, conferring pro-metastatic phenotype. generated tumor-conditioned macrophages vitro, human peripheral blood monocytes cultured conditioned media generated normal pancreatic PDAC cell lines obtain steady-state tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), respectively. Compared steady-state macrophages, TAMs promoted vascular network formation, augmented extravasation tumor cells blood vessels, induced higher levels EMT. TAMs exhibited pronounced glycolytic signature metabolic flux assay, corresponding elevated glycolytic gene transcript levels. Inhibiting glycolysis TAMs competitive inhibitor Hexokinase II (HK2), 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), sufficient disrupt pro-metastatic phenotype, reversing observed increases TAM-supported angiogenesis, extravasation, EMT. results indicate key role metabolic reprogramming tumor-infiltrating macrophages PDAC metastasis, highlight therapeutic potential using pharmacologics modulate metabolic pathways.
