 BACKGROUND: frequency intensity flood events expected increase result global climate change upcoming decades, potentially resulting increased re-suspension sediments fluvial systems. Contamination re-suspended sediments legacy contaminants, including dioxins dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), well polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) great ecotoxicological concern. DLCs, extent also PAHs, exhibit toxicity activation aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). However, interactions DLCs pathways known mediated AhR fully understood date. METHODS: study aimed investigate molecular biochemical effects roach (Rutilus rutilus) 10 days exposure suspensions three natural sediments differed level DLC contamination. Concentrations biliary PAH metabolites hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity quantified exposed fish. Furthermore, abundance transcripts several genes related energy metabolism, response oxidative stress, apoptosis, well cytochrome P450 1A (cyp1a) quantified. RESULTS: Biliary PAH metabolites activation AhR confirmed suitable early warning biomarkers exposure suspended sediments containing DLCs PAHs corresponded well analytically determined concentrations contaminants. Although abundances transcripts superoxide dismutase (sod), protein kinase c delta (pkcd), ATP-binding cassette transporter c9 (abcc9) altered treatment compared unexposed control fish, none showed time- concentration-dependent response. abundance transcripts pyruvate carboxylase (pc) transferrin variant (tfd) remained unaltered treatments. CONCLUSIONS: shown contaminated sediments become risk fish re-suspension events (e.g., flooding dredging). also demonstrated roach, native European freshwater systems, suitable sentinel species due great sensitivity ecological relevance. Roach may particularly suitable future field studies assess toxicological concerns associated release DLCs PAHs sediment re-suspension.
