 new method directly measuring 18O isotope effects decarboxylation reactions developed. running reaction high vacuum (10(-5) torr), CO2 leaves solution exchange oxygens water extent greater 2%. Thus, method permits determination 18O isotope effects precision isotope ratio mass spectrometer, without necessity resorting remote label method attendant required syntheses. method used determine 18O isotope effects decarboxylation oxalacetate (OAA) Mg2+, enzymatically OAA decarboxylase Pseudomonas putida; 13C isotope effects also reported enzyme, well decarboxylation OAA pyruvate kinase. Initial velocity patterns pH profiles reported P. putida enzyme, available data used discuss kinetic chemical mechanism decarboxylation.
