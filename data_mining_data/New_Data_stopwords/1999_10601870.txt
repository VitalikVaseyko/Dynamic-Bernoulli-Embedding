 aroA gene (Escherichia coli nomenclature) encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae identified, cloned overexpressed E. coli, enzyme purified homogeneity. shown catalyze reversible conversion shikimate 3-phosphate (S3P) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) EPSP inorganic phosphate. Activation univalent cations observed forward reaction, NH+4, Rb+ K+ exerting greatest effects. Km(PEP) lowered increasing [NH+4] [K+], whereas Km(S3P) rose increasing [K+], fell increasing [NH+4]. Increasing [NH+4] [K+] resulted overall increase kcat. Glyphosate (GLP) found competitive inhibitor PEP, potency inhibition profoundly affected [NH+4] [K+]. example, increasing [NH+4] [K+] reduced Ki(GLP versus PEP) 600-fold. reverse reaction, enzyme catalysis less sensitive univalent cations. analysis included univalent cation concentrations comparable found bacterial cells. Therefore, observed effects metal ions likely reflect physiological behavior EPSP synthase also add understanding inhibit enzyme host organism. much evidence suggest EPSP synthase essential bacterial survival, discovery serious gram-positive pathogen S. pneumoniae inhibition GLP indicate potential broad-spectrum antibacterial target.
