 aim study assess whether endosperm-specific carotenoid biosynthesis influenced core metabolic processes maize embryo endosperm global seed metabolism adapted expanded biosynthetic capacity. Although enhancement carotenoid biosynthesis targeted endosperm maize kernels, concurrent up-regulation sterol fatty acid biosynthesis embryo measured. Targeted terpenoid analysis, non-targeted metabolomic, proteomic, transcriptomic profiling revealed changes especially carbohydrate metabolism transgenic line. In-depth analysis data, including changes metabolite pools increased enzyme transcript concentrations, gave first insight metabolic variation precipitated higher up-stream metabolite demand extended biosynthesis capacities terpenoids fatty acids. integrative model put forward explain metabolic regulation increased provision terpenoid fatty acid precursors, particularly glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate pyruvate acetyl-CoA imported fructose glucose. model supported higher activities fructokinase, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase indicating higher flux glycolytic pathway. Although pyruvate acetyl-CoA utilization higher engineered line, pyruvate kinase activity lower. sufficient provision metabolites may supported by-pass reaction sequence involving phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme.
