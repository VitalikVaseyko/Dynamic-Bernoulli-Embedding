 short sequence predominantly basic amino acids Pro-Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val SV40 Large responsible normal nuclear location protein. Alteration Lys-128 six different residues Arg renders Large cytoplasmic, whereas single amino acid changes surrounding region impair prevent nuclear accumulation. transposed amino terminus cytoplasmic Large species, Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase chicken muscle pyruvate kinase, sequence around Lys-128 Large able direct recipient protein nucleus. demonstrates amino acids sufficient nuclear location act nuclear location signal. computer search 2500 proteins reveals nuclear proteins (for example, BK virus Large T, SV40 VP2 adenovirus 72kDa DNA binding protein) contain similar basic tracts, presumed non-nuclear proteins (for example, poliovirus VP3). suggest related sequence acts nuclear location signal nuclear proteins sequence function cases, perhaps accessible. similar, shorter less basic sequence, detected number nuclear proteins, example, polyoma virus Large T, SV40 VP1 several histones. However, sequences also found many proteins. Perhaps shorter basic sequences also act nuclear location signals, functional need exposed (for example, amino terminus protein SV40 VP1) present multiple copies.
