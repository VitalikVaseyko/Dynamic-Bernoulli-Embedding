 Severe hemolytic anemia Basenji dogs secondary pyruvate kinase deficiency corrected allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) littermates normal hematopoiesis conventional myeloablative nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. levels donor chimerism low (<20%) nonmyeloablative HCT, partial correction hemolytic anemia. next addressed whether allogeneic cell therapy nonmyeloablative HCT would convert mixed full hematopoietic chimerism, achieve sustained remission hemolysis, prevent progression marrow fibrosis liver cirrhosis. Three pyruvate kinase-deficient dogs given HCT respective dog leukocyte antigen-identical littermates nonmyeloablative conditioning 200 cGy total body irradiation. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted mycophenolate mofetil cyclosporine. 3 dogs engrafted mixed hematopoietic chimerism donor levels ranging 12% 55% bone marrow. 2 3 dogs, decreases levels donor chimerism 25 weeks nonmyeloablative HCT, hemolysis recurred associated increased reticulocyte counts. 3 dogs 2 serial infusions donor lymphocytes (DLI) respective donors least 20 weeks apart convert mixed full donor chimerism. dogs recurrence hemolytic anemia nonmyeloablative HCT achieved higher levels donor chimerism, donor contributions ranging 47% 62% bone marrow 50% 69% 16% 25% granulocyte mononuclear cell fractions peripheral blood, respectively, remission hemolytic anemia. One dog responded first DLI, 5 weeks second DLI, dog converted full donor chimerism. last follow-up, dogs showed clinical improvement, determined increasing hematocrits normal reticulocyte counts. Analysis marrow 3 years HCT showed normal cellularity, normal myeloid-erythroid ratio, minimal marrow fibrosis. Liver biopsies demonstrated normal histologies minimal fibrosis. conclude DLI nonmyeloablative HCT increase levels donor cells contributing hematopoiesis recipients, inducing remissions hemolytic process preventing complications associated iron overload.
