 relation activation (phosphorylation) state pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC; EC 1.2.4.1, EC 2.3.1.12, EC 1.6.4.3) rate pyruvate oxidation examined isolated, metabolically active, tightly coupled mitochondria rat cerebral cortex. pyruvate malate substrates, activation state PDHC decreased addition ADP, rates oxygen uptake 14CO2 formation [1-14C]pyruvate increased. lack correlation activation state PDHC rate pyruvate oxidation seen media containing 5, 30, 100 mM KCl. activation state PDHC pyruvate oxidation increased, however, KCl increased 5 100 mM. Although PDHC inactivated ATP-dependent kinase (EC 2.7.1.99), direct measurement ATP ADP failed show consistent relationship activation state PDHC either ATP levels ATP/ADP ratios. Comparison activation state PDHC uncoupled oligomycin-treated mitochondria also failed correlate PDHC activation state adenine nucleotides. brain mitochondria, unlike tissues, activation state PDHC seem related clearly rate pyruvate oxidation, mitochondrial adenylate energy charge.
