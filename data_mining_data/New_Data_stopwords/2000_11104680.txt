 Activation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (PDHC) promotes glucose disposal, whereas inactivation conserves glucose. PDH kinases (PDHKs) regulate glucose oxidation inhibitory phosphorylation PDHC. adult rat heart contains three PDHK isoforms PDHK1, PDHK2 PDHK4. Using Western-blot analysis, specific antibodies raised individual recombinant PDHK1, PDHK2 PDHK4, present study investigated PDHK isoform expression developing rat heart adulthood. identified clear differences patterns protein expression PDHK isoforms first 3 weeks post-natal development, marked up-regulation isoforms PDHK1 PDHK4. Distinctions three cardiac PDHK isoforms also demonstrated respect post-neonatal maturational up-regulation; greatest up-regulation PDHK1 least up-regulation PDHK4 post-neonatal period maturity. study also examined role thyroid hormone status lipid supply PDHK isoform expression. observed marked selective increases amount PDHK4 protein present relative total cardiac protein hyperthyroidism high-fat feeding. Overall, data identify PDHK isoform PDHK1 potential regulatory importance glucose oxidation adult compared neonatal heart, cardiac PDHK4 PDHK isoform whose expression specifically responsive changes lipid supply, suggesting up-regulation early post-natal life may perinatal switch use fatty acids energy source. also identify regulation pyruvate sensitivity cardiac PDHK physiological variable, change requires factors addition change lipid supply.
