 Selective glycolytic inhibition (GI) promotes electromechanical alternans triggered beats isolated cardiac myocytes. sought determine whether GI promotes triggered activity early afterdepolarization (EAD) delayed afterdepolarizations intact hearts isolated adult aged rats. Dual voltage intracellular calcium ion (Ca(i)(2+)) fluorescent optical maps single cell glass microelectrode recordings made left ventricular (LV) epicardium isolated Langendorff-perfused adult ( approximately 4 mo) aged ( approximately 24 mo) rat hearts. GI induced replacing glucose 10 mM pyruvate oxygenated Tyrode's. Within 20 min, GI slowed Ca(i)(2+) transient decline rate shortened action potential duration groups. changes associated ventricular fibrillation (VF) aged hearts (64 66) adult hearts (0 18; P < 0.001). VF preceded transient period focal ventricular tachycardia caused EAD-mediated triggered activity leading VF within seconds. VF suppressed ATP-sensitive K (K(ATP)) channel blocker glibenclamide (1 muM) (0 7) mitochondrial K(ATP) block. Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) blocker KN-93 (1 muM) prevented GI-mediated VF (P < 0.05). Block Na-Ca exchanger (NCX) SEA0400 (2 muM) prevented GI-mediated VF (3 6), provided significant bradycardia occur. Aged hearts significantly greater LV fibrosis reduced connexin 43 adult hearts (P < 0.05). conclude aged fibrotic unlike adult rat hearts, GI promotes EADs, triggered activity, VF activation K(ATP) channels CaMKII NCX.
