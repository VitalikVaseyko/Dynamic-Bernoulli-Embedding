 Cyclic AMP plays major, primary, role regulation hepatic gluconeogenesis. cyclic nucleotide acts two levels. First, cAMP levels determine phosphorylation state key regulatory enzymes including pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Regulation cAMP levels glucagon, insulin, catecholamines accounts large part minute-to-minute hormonal control pathway flux fed animals transition fed starved; second, cAMP plays key role regulation gene transcription phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, glucokinase, probably 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Cyclic AMP acts induce synthesis mRNA phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase probably fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase suppresses transcription genes pyruvate kinase glucokinase. role regulation gene transcription bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase remains defined. Insulin important hormone restraining level cAMP. Insulin acts oppose acute actions cAMP enzyme phosphorylation, presumably activating phosphodiesterase thereby lowering cAMP levels. Insulin also opposes action hormones (alpha-adrenergic agonists, angiotensin, vasopressin) act liver via cAMP-independent phosphorylation. However, systems studied, cAMP-independent effects gluconeogenic/glycolytic pathway flux small comparison cAMP-dependent regulation. Insulin also opposes action cAMP gene transcription yet unknown mechanism. effect appear involve changes level cAMP hormone also acts cultured cells added alone presence dexamethasone. ability insulin lower hepatic cAMP levels modulate gene expression important restoration acute regulatory hormone responsiveness starved diabetic animals could occur insulin unable lower cAMP levels dominant factor modulating gene expression key regulatory enzymes. Clearly, hepatic gluconeogenic/glycolytic pathway undergoes complex extremely well-integrated regulation hormones accounts large part major role organ plays control glucose homeostasis.
