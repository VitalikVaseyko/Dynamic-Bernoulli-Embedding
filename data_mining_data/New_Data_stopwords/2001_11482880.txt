 evaluated iron status searched mutations C282Y H63D hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) 34 pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient patients 29 unrelated families. Nine received multiple transfusions. Thirteen 25 nontransfused patients displayed increased serum ferritin concentration, absence conditions known raise parameter. HFE genotype abnormal 9 34 patients. allele frequency 1.8% mutation 845G--> (C282Y) 16.1% mutation 187C-->G (H63D). Nontransfused subjects abnormal genotype serum ferritin transferrin saturation values significantly higher wild-type genotype. 12 adult nontransfused patients increased iron status parameters, 1 C282Y homozygous, 1 compound heterozygous C282Y H63D, 3 H63D heterozygous, 7 normal HFE genotype. Serum ferritin transferrin saturation related hemoglobin, reticulocytes, bilirubin concentration. multivariate analysis serum ferritin independently associated age gender, splenectomy HFE genotypes. retrospective evaluation iron status profile 10 patients (3 abnormal 7 wild-type HFE genotype) least 10 years follow-up showed overt iron accumulation requiring iron chelation occurred 3 patients (2 splenectomized) mutated HFE gene.
