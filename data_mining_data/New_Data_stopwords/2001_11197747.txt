 abundance mRNAs pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoenzymes four brain regions young (10 wk) aged (50 wk) rats investigated reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). mRNAs PDK1, 2, 4 detected regions examined. level PDK2 mRNA abundant among isoenzymes brain regions judged PCR cycles. level PDK1 mRNA relatively high cerebellum cerebral cortex compared medulla oblongata hippocampus. Aging decreased levels mRNAs PDK1 2 cerebellum increased PDK2 mRNA hippocampus cerebral cortex. level PDK4 mRNA affected aging. results provide first evidence suggesting regional difference abundance mRNAs PDK isoenzymes rat brain levels mRNAs isoenzymes affected aging.
