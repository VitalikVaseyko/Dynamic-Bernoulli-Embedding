 HAMLET first member new family tumoricidal protein-lipid complexes kill cancer cells broadly, sparing healthy, differentiated cells. Many diverse tumor cell types sensitive lethal effect, suggesting HAMLET identifies activates conserved death pathways cancer cells. Here, investigated molecular basis difference sensitivity cancer cells healthy cells. Using combination small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibition, proteomic metabolomic technology, identified c-Myc oncogene one essential determinant HAMLET sensitivity. Increased c-Myc expression levels promoted sensitivity HAMLET shRNA knockdown c-Myc suppressed lethal response, suggesting oncogenic transformation c-Myc creates HAMLET-sensitive phenotype. Furthermore, HAMLET sensitivity modified glycolytic state tumor cells. Glucose deprivation sensitized tumor cells HAMLET-induced cell death shRNA screen, hexokinase 1 (HK1), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 1 hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha modified HAMLET sensitivity. HK1 shown bind HAMLET protein array containing approximately 8000 targets, HK activity decreased within 15 min HAMLET treatment, morphological signs tumor cell death. parallel, HAMLET triggered rapid metabolic paralysis carcinoma cells. Tumor cells also shown contain large amounts oleic acid derivatives already 15 min. results identify HAMLET novel anti-cancer agent kills tumor cells exploiting unifying features cancer cells oncogene addiction Warburg effect.
