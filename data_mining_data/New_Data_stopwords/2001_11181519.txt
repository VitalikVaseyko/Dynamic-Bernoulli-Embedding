 Pyruvate kinase L (PK-L) key regulatory enzyme hepatic glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway dephosphorylated activated response insulin. However, signaling cascades involved insulin effect established. work investigated potential involvement phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways short-term modulation PK-L insulin primary cultures rat hepatocytes. Wortmannin, concentration 100 nM, caused marked inhibition PI 3-K/protein kinase B pathway, became complete 500 nM wortmannin. Likewise, wortmannin 100 500 nM, elicited partial total inhibitions insulin-mediated activation PK-L, respectively. However, PI 3-K inhibitor also reduced insulin-mediated phosphorylation p44/p42 MAPK cultured rat hepatocytes, indicating PI 3-K MAPK pathways could involved PK-L activation insulin. Three facts appear reinforce hypothesis: 1) selective complete inhibition PI 3-K/protein kinase B pathway LY294002 (50 microM) accompanied partial blockade insulin-induced PK-L activation; 2) signaling MAPK cascade selectively suppressed presence PD98059 (50 microM), 50% reduction insulin-induced activation PK-L observed; 3) effect PD98059 (50 microM) PK-L activation reinforced additional presence 100 nM wortmannin. also observed blockade p70 S6-kinase rapamycin affect activation PK-L insulin. findings concluded PI 3-K MAPK pathways, p70 S6-kinase, involved short-term activation PK-L insulin rat hepatocytes.
