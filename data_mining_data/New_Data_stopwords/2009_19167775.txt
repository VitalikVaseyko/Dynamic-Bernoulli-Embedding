 Paramecium tetraurelia protein parafusin (PFUS) Toxoplasma gondii protein parafusin-related protein 1 (PRP1) two covalent modifications (phosphorylation phosphoglucosylation) members phosphoglucomutase superfamily, associating secretory vesicle scaffolds respective cells. study tests hypothesis PRP1 functional ortholog PFUS, functioning identically Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis. Electroporation fluorescently labeled recombinant His-PRP1 live Paramecium cells resulted localization docked, dense-core secretory vesicles (DCSVs) pattern identical endogenous PFUS. tam8 mutants, defective transport DCSVs, fluorescently labeled protein restricted un-transported DCSVs. Specificity PRP1 localization demonstrated electroporating labeled actin pyruvate kinase, failed localize either docked undocked vesicles. wild-type Paramecium, electroporated His-PRP1 dissociated DCSVs upon exocytosis, re-associated new organelles formed. Mutagenized His-PRP1 species (S146A S146E) cannot phosphorylated P2 calcium-dependent kinase vitro. Upon electroporation, molecules remained cytoplasmic un-associated DCSVs, mutation another PRP1 serine residue (S560A) neither affect localization DCSVs phosphorylation pattern. Therefore, heterologous system, localization, transport dissociation/re-association PRP1 substituted PFUS, supporting conclusion proteins functional orthologs. assay also identified strategic residue S146 within PFUS ortholog (S138 PFUS extrapolation) required post-translational modification, DCSV scaffold association exocytosis.
