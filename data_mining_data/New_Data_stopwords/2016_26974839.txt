 Defences bacteria usually infect endometrium postpartum cattle impaired metabolic energy stress, leading endometritis infertility. endometrial response bacteria depends innate immunity, recognition pathogen-associated molecular patterns stimulating inflammation, characterised secretion interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 IL-8. metabolic stress impacts tissue responses pathogens unclear, integration energy metabolism innate immunity means stressing one system might affect other. tested hypothesis homeostatic pathways integrate energy metabolism innate immunity bovine endometrial tissue. Glucose deprivation reduced secretion IL-1beta, IL-6 IL-8 ex vivo organ cultures bovine endometrium challenged pathogen-associated molecular patterns lipopolysaccharide bacterial lipopeptide. Endometrial inflammatory responses lipopolysaccharide also reduced small molecules activate inhibit intracellular sensor energy, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, inhibition mammalian target rapamycin, global metabolic sensor AMPK, little effect inflammation. Similarly, endometrial inflammatory responses lipopolysaccharide affected insulin-like growth factor-1, endocrine regulator metabolism. Interestingly, inflammatory responses lipopolysaccharide increased endometrial glucose consumption induced Warburg effect, could exacerbate deficits glucose availability tissue. conclusion, metabolic energy stress perturbed inflammatory responses pathogen-associated molecular patterns bovine endometrial tissue, fundamental regulators cellular energy, glucose availability AMPK, greatest impact innate immunity.
