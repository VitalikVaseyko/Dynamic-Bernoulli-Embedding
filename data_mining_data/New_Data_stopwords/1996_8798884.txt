 practical study presented influence cell debris polymer recycling upon operation two-stage aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) recovery yeast bulk protein, pyruvate kinase fumarase. Brewers' yeast disrupted using one two types high-pressure homogenisers bead mill. different cell debris suspensions partitioned single PEG-phosphate ATPS extraction efficiency solid-liquid separation examined. continuously operated two-stage ATPS process, using spray columns, presented practical problems polymer recycling discussed. Conclusions drawn concerning generic implementation operational stability ATPS practical protein recoveries.
