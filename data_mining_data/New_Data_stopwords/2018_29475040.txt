 last years, several reports established notion metabolism housekeeping process, instead active effector physiological changes. idea metabolic status may rule wide range phenomena cell biology starting broadly accepted. Thus, current developmental biology begun describe different ways metabolic profile cell developmental programs organism crosstalk. review, discuss mechanisms metabolism impacts processes governing development. review growing body evidence supports notion aerobic glycolysis required cells undergoing fast growth high proliferation, similarly Warburg effect described tumor cells. Glycolytic metabolism explains higher ATP synthesis rate required cell growth, also uncoupling mitochondrial activity bioenergetics needed provide anabolism sufficient precursors. also discuss recent studies, show addition role providing energy carbon chains, metabolic status cell also influence epigenetic regulation developmental processes. Although metabolic aspects development starting explored, doubt ongoing research field shape future landscape Developmental Biology.
