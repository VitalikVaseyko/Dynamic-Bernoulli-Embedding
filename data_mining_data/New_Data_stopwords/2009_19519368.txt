 Glycolysis one principle pathways ATP generation cells present cell tissues; erythrocytes, glycolysis pathway ATP synthesis since mature red cells lack internal structures necessary produce energy vital life. Red cell deficiencies detected erythrocyte glycolytic pathways, although frequencies differ owing diverse causes, affected enzyme severity clinical manifestations. number enzyme deficiencies known endless. frequent glycolysis abnormality pyruvate kinase deficiency, since around 500 cases known, first reported 1961. However, approximately 200 cases due mutations. contrast, one case phosphoglycerate mutase BB type mutation, described 2003, detected. mutations located coding sequences genes, others, missense, deletions, insertions, splice defects, premature stop codons promoter mutations, also frequent. Understanding crystal structure enzymes permits molecular modelling studies which, turn, reveal mutations affect enzyme structure function.
