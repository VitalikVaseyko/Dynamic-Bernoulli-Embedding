 sulfur-containing amino acid, taurine (Tau), regulates glucose lipid homeostasis normal, pre- diabetic conditions. Here, aimed verify whether Tau supplementation exerts beneficial effects obesity, hyperglycemia alterations islet functions, leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob), long period treatment. weaning 12 months age, female ob/ob mice received, not, 5% Tau drinking water (obTau group). period, reduction hypertriglyceridemia improvement glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity observed obTau mice. addition, daily metabolic flexibility restored obTau mice. gastrocnemius muscle obTau mice, activation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased, total AMPK protein content reduced. Finally, isolated islets obTau mice expressed high amounts pyruvate carboxylase (PC) protein lower glucose-induced insulin secretion. Taking evidences together Tau supplementation long-term positive actions glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity, associated reduction glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, ob/ob mice. improvement insulin actions obTau mice due, least part, increased activation AMPK skeletal muscle, increased content PC enzyme pancreatic islets may help preserve glucose responsiveness obTau islets, possibly contributing islet cell survive.
