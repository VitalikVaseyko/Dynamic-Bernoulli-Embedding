 Grb14 belongs Grb7 family molecular adapters identified inhibitor insulin signaling. Grb14 binds activated insulin receptors (IR) inhibits catalytic activity. gain insight Grb14 molecular mechanism action, generated various mutants studied Grb14-IR interaction using coimmunoprecipitation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments. Biological activity analyzed using Xenopus oocyte model functional complementation assay measuring cellular proliferation rate Grb14 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. studies identified two important interaction sites, Grb14 L404-IR L1038 Grb14 R385-IR K1168, involving IR alphaC-helix activation loop, respectively. Interestingly, former involves residues likely crucial specificity IR binding regard members Grb7 family. addition, mutation Grb14-S370 residue suggested phosphorylation status controlled biological activity protein. demonstrated insulin-induced Grb14-PDK1 interaction required addition Grb14-IR binding mediate maximal inhibition insulin signaling. study provides important insights molecular determinants Grb14 action demonstrating Grb14 regulates insulin action two levels, IR binding interfering downstream pathways. Indeed, precise knowledge molecular mechanism insulin signaling inhibition Grb14 prerequisite development insulin-sensitizing molecules treat pathophysiological states obesity type 2 diabetes.
