 Hypoxia, frequently observed liver cancer metastasis, influences tumor progression resistance therapy. Although hypoxia-associated biomarkers use cancers, none recognized surrogate hypoxia liver cancer. study, generated seven unique human single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies (Abs) specific hypoxic liver cancer cells, using normoxia-depleted vs hypoxia-selected phage library panning technology. developing scFv immunoprecipitation-based mass spectrometry method, antigen bound one Abs (H103) identified M2 splice isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), enzyme key regulator aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. Increased expression PKM2 induced hypoxia liver cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed PKM2 highly expressed moderately well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues hypovascular staining pattern. High expression PKM2 also localized perinecrotic area intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) tissues. percentage HCC ICC tumor expressing PKM2 significantly higher tumor necrosis, low microvessel density, advanced stage. Moreover, H103 scFv Ab efficiently internalized hypoxic liver cancer cells could potential targeted drug delivery. CONCLUSION: study, first time, developed hypoxia-specific scFv Ab H103 liver cancer cells, revealed PKM2 promising biomarker hypoxia HCC ICC tissues. allow exploration valuable Ab PKM2 antigen hypoxia targeting liver cancer.
