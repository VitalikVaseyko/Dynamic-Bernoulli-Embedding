 enzymic synthesis utilising arginine kinase preparing arginine phosphate high state purity described. dissociation constant magnesium arginine phosphate, determined gel filtration, 30.0 +/- 0.9 mM. potassium arginine phosphate calculated 63.0 +/- 4.0 mM measured effect potassium apparent magnesium dissociation constant. effect KCl reaction catalysed type-M pyruvate kinase Carcinus maenas (the common shore crab) pincer leg muscle investigated. effect seen C. maenas pyruvate kinase activity, apart due alteration K+ concentration, adding 70 mM potassium arginine phosphate reaction medium. less pure form arginine phosphate found give apparent noncompetitive inhibition enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate varied substrate. apparent inhibition accounted removal ADP assay medium side reaction involving arginine kinase arginine phosphate. results discussed terms possible physiological control type-M pyruvate kinase C. maenas.
