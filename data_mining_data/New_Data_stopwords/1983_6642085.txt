 Data emerging insulin receptor studies performed red blood cells (RBCs) monocytes subject always agreement; dichotomy might occur since variations mean RBC age taken account insulin receptors two cell types behave differently. present investigation RBCs normal male subjects separated five populations different mean age means centrifugation RBCs discontinuous gradient buffered Percoll 10 min 1000 X g. Insulin binding varied significantly depending upon RBC population tested closely correlated activity pyruvate kinase (r2 = 0.86), well-known marker RBC age. data suggested pyruvate kinase assay might helpful studies RBCs. confirm hypothesis, RBCs 10 normal male subjects 13 male patients hemolytic anemia studied; insulin binding correlated pyruvate kinase activity. adjusting insulin binding 2 X 10(9) RBCs/ml range data abnormally high, became acceptable adjusting insulin binding pyruvate kinase activity (0.75 U/2 X 10(9) RBCs). overall data indicated insulin binding highly correlated pyruvate kinase activity (r2 = 0.82) slightly reticulocyte number (r2 = 0.56) since reticulocytes also erythrocytes lose receptors maturation. Pyruvate kinase activity measured RBCs normal men normally menstruating women seventh twenty-fourth days cycle; results demonstrated adjustment data, according mean RBC age, broadens dichotomy monocyte RBC data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
