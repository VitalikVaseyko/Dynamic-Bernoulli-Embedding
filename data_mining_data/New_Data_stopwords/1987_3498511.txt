 MgATP binds active site (site 1) secondary site (site 2) monomer muscle pyruvate kinase previously found binding studies X-ray analysis. Interproton distances MgATP bound site measured time-dependent nuclear Overhauser effect absence presence phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate), blocks ATP binding site 1. Interproton distances site 2 consistent single conformation bound ATP high antiglycosidic torsional angle (chi = 68 +/- 10 degrees) C3'-endo ribose pucker (delta = 90 +/- 10 degrees). Interproton distances site 1, determined absence P-enolpyruvate assuming averaging distances sites, cannot fit single adenine-ribose conformation require contribution least three low-energy structures: 62 +/- 10% low anti (chi = 30 degrees), C3'-endo; 20 +/- 8% high anti (chi = 55 degrees), O1'-endo; 18 +/- 8% syn (chi = 217 degrees), C2'-endo. Although different set ATP conformations might also fit interproton distances, mixture conformations used also fits previously determined distances Mn2+ protons ATP bound site 1 [Sloan, D.
