 Pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) erythrocyte deficiencies induced chemotherapy studied 6 patients. immunological tests may assumed PK PFK deficiencies due different direct mechanisms: disturbance synthesis one PFK subunit; mutation(s) structural gene PK result synthesis mutant proteins. Several molecular mechanisms probably origin disturbances induced chemotherapy red blood cells. study alterations mimic detected preleukaemic leukaemic states, provides information molecular events possible production chemo-induced cancers.
