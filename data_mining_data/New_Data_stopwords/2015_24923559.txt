 Although nitrosative stress known severely impede ability living systems generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, limited information microorganisms fulfill energy needs order survive reactive nitrogen species (RNS). study demonstrate elaborate strategy involving substrate-level phosphorylation enables soil microbe Pseudomonas fluorescens synthesize ATP defined medium fumarate sole carbon source. enhanced activities enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pyruvate phosphate dikinase coupled increased activities phospho-transfer enzymes like adenylate kinase nucleoside diphophate kinase provide effective strategy produce high energy nucleosides O2-independent manner. alternate ATP producing machinery fuelled precursors derived fumarate aid fumarase C fumarate reductase. metabolic reconfiguration key survival P. fluorescens reveals potential targets RNS-resistant organisms.
