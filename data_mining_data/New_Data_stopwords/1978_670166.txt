 31P NMR studies Cd(II) Zn(II) chelates adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPgammaS) Cd(II) chelate adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (ATPbetaS) indicate metal ions chelate sulfur atom thiophosphate group. Since Mg(II) chelates oxygen thiophosphate group diastereoisomer equivalent configuration Cd(II) chelate opposite diastereoisomer. consequence, inversion stereospecificity observed Cd(II) substituted Mg(II) phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed yeast hexokinase rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. Co(II) activating ion yeast hexokinase ATPbetaS substrate, stereospecificity observed. Since absolute configuration diastereoisomer Co(III)(NH3)4ATP active substrate yeast hexokinase established Cornelius Cleland (Cornelius, R. D., Cleland, W. W. (1978) Biochemistry, press), absolute stereochemistry Mg(II) complex B isomer ATPbetaS established stereospecificity hexokinase reaction.
