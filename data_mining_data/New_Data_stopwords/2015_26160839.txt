 Akt/mTORC1 pathway plays central role activation Warburg effect cancer. Here, present first time halofuginone (HF) treatment inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) growth vitro vivo regulation Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. Halofuginone treatment human CRC cells inhibited cell proliferation, induced generation reactive oxygen species apoptosis. expected, reduced level NADPH also observed, least part due inactivation glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pentose phosphate pathway upon HF treatment. Given findings, investigated metabolic regulation HF Akt/mTORC1-mediated aerobic glycolysis found HF downregulated Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. Moreover, metabolomics delineated slower rates glycolytic flux glucose-derived tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Meanwhile, glucose transporter GLUT1 hexokinase-2 glycolysis suppressed CRC cells upon HF treatment, support notion HF regulates Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway dampen glucose uptake glycolysis CRC cells. Furthermore, HF retarded tumor growth nude mice inoculated HCT116 cells, showing anticancer activity HF metabolic regulation Akt/mTORC1 CRC.
