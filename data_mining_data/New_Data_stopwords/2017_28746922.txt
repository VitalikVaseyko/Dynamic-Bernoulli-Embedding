 BACKGROUND/AIMS: paper aims explore effects pyruvate kinase (PK) M2 gene silencing proliferation apoptosis colorectal cancer (CRC) LS-147T SW620 cells. METHODS: CRC LS-147T SW620 cells highly expressing PKM2 randomly selected quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assigned blank (no transfection), PKM2-shRNA (transfection shRNA) empty plasmid (transfection empty plasmid) groups. Immunofluorescence applied detect PKM2 protein expression. qRT-PCR Western blotting conducted assess mRNA protein expression PKM2, p53 p21. cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay used assess cell proliferation. Flow cytometry used assess cell cycle apoptosis rate, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining kit used assess cell senescence. RESULTS: PKM2 exhibited high mRNA expression among CRC LS-147T SW620 cells remarkable protein expression noted cytoplasm nucleus. PKM2-shRNA group exhibited reduced PKM2 mRNA protein expression, whereas p53 p21 expression increased compared blank empty plasmid groups. Cell proliferation PKM2-shRNA cells decreased significantly compared blank group empty plasmid groups. PKM2-shRNA group exhibited cells G1 phase fewer cells G2/M phase compared blank empty plasmid groups. addition, PKM2-shRNA group exhibited significantly increased apoptosis rates beta-galactosidase activity compared blank empty plasmid groups. CONCLUSION: study demonstrates PKM2 gene silencing suppresses proliferation promotes apoptosis LS-147T SW620 cells.
