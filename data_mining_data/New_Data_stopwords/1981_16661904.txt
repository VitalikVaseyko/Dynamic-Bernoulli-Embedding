 Isolated cells leaves Spinacia oleracea maintained state capable high rates photosynthetic CO(2) fixation 60 hours. incorporation (14)CO(2) saturating CO(2) conditions carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids, effect ammonia incorporation studied. Total incorporation, specific radioactivity, pool size determined function time protein amino acids gamma-aminobutyric acid. measurements specific radio-activities approaches (14)C "saturation" amino acids indicate presence relative sizes metabolically active passive pools amino acids.Added ammonia decreased carbon fixation carbohydrates increased fixation carboxylic acids amino acids. Different amino acids were, however, affected different highly specific ways. Ammonia caused large stimulatory effects incorporation (14)C glutamine (a factor 21), aspartate, asparagine, valine, alanine, arginine, histidine. effect slight decreases seen glycine, serine, phenylalanine, tyrosine labeling. case glutamate, (14)C labeling decreased, specific radioactivity increased. production labeled gamma-aminobutyric acid virtually stopped ammonia.The results indicate added ammonia stimulates reactions mediated pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, seen plant systems. data effects added ammonia total labeling, pool sizes, specific radioactivities several amino acids provides number indications intracellular sites principal synthesis carbon skeletons amino acids selective nature effects increased intracellular ammonia concentration synthesis.
