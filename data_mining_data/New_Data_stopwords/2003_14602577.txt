 Carbohydrate depletion precipitates fatigue skeletal muscle, but, pyruvate provides acetyl-CoA mainline oxidation anaplerotic carbon citric acid cycle (CAC), mechanism remains obscure. Thus pyruvate CAC kinetic parameters independently quantified mitochondria isolated rat mixed skeletal muscle. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (Jo) measured polarographically either pyruvate malate added stepwise presence saturating concentration substrate. substrate titrations carried across physiological range fixed extramitochondrial ATP free energy states (DeltaGP), established creatine kinase energy clamp, also saturating [ADP]. apparent Km,malate mitochondrial Jo ranged 21 32 microM, apparent Km,pyruvate ranged 12 26 microM, substrate Km values increasing DeltaGP declined. Vmax substrates also increased DeltaGP fell, reflecting thermodynamic control Jo. Reported vivo skeletal muscle [malate] >10-fold greater Km,malate determined study. marked contrast, K(m,pyruvate) determined near [pyruvate] reported muscle approaching exhaustion associated glycogen depletion. data evaluated context linear thermodynamic force-flow (DeltaGP-Jo) relationship, DeltaGP-Jo slope essentially insensitive changes [malate] range observed vivo decreased markedly declining [pyruvate] across physiological range. Mitochondrial respiration particularly sensitive variations [pyruvate] physiological range. contrast, physiological [malate] exerts little, any, influence mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation measured vitro.
