 Drug development groups close discovering another pot gold-a therapeutic target-similar success imatinib (Gleevec) field cancer biology. Modern molecular biology improved cancer therapy identification pharmaceutically viable targets, yet major problems risks associated late-phase cancer therapy remain. Presently, growing number reports initiated discussion benefits metabolic regulation cancers. Warburg effect, great discovery approximately 70 years ago, addresses "universality" cancer characteristics. instance, cancer cells prefer aerobic glycolysis instead mitochondrial respiration. Recently, cancer metabolism explained metabolites also modern molecular chemical biological techniques. Scientists seeking context-dependent universality among cancer types according metabolic enzymatic pathway signatures. review presents current cancer metabolism studies discusses future directions cancer therapy targeting bio-energetics, bio-anabolism, autophagy, emphasizing important contribution cancer metabolism cancer therapy.
