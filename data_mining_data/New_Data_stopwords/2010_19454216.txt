 Recently, resurgence interest regulatory role cell metabolism tumor biology immunology. assess changes metabolite levels cell populations tissues, especially small clinical samples, highly sensitive assays required. Based reaction glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) diaphorase-resazurin amplifying system, developed fluorescence methodology measure G6P concentrations cell extracts. approach, G6P oxidized G6P dehydrogenase presence NADP+, stoichiometrically generated NADPH amplified diaphorase cycling system produce highly fluorescent molecule-resorufin. limit detection (LOD) assay 10 pmol. assay Z' factor 0.81. usefulness demonstrated experiments pyruvate kinase inhibitor, phenylalanine, added cells. 2h incubation 37 degrees C, G6P levels rose 20%, thereby illustrating vitro Warburg-like effect cell metabolism.
