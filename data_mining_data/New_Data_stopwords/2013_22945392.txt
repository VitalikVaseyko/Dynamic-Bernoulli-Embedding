 Alterations cell metabolism increasingly recognized hallmark cancer exploited development diagnostic tools targeted therapeutics. Recently, (1)(3)C MRS-detectable hyperpolarized pyruvate lactate conversion validated models noninvasive imaging method detection tumors treatment response, successfully passed phase clinical trials. date, response treatment associated decrease hyperpolarized lactate production. study, monitored effect treatment mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 prostate breast cancer cells. Following treatment, observed 31% decrease flux hyperpolarized (1)(3)C label treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells relative controls. contrast, unexpectedly, flux increased 167% treated PC3 prostate cancer cells. mechanistically explain observations, investigated treatment-induced changes different factors known affect pyruvate lactate conversion. NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form) levels remained unchanged, whereas lactate dehydrogenase expression activity, well intracellular lactate, increased cell lines, providing explanation elevated hyperpolarized lactate observed PC3 cells. expression MCT1, mediates pyruvate transport, decreased treated MCF-7, PC3, cells. identifies pyruvate transport rate limiting U0126-treated MCF-7 cells explains decrease hyperpolarized lactate observed cells following treatment. findings highlight complexity interactions MEK metabolism, need mechanistic validation hyperpolarized (1)(3)C MRS used monitor treatment-induced molecular responses.
