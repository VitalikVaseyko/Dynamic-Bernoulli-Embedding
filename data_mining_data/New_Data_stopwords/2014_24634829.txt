 Pairing selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene (BZA) estrogen tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC) novel menopausal therapy. investigated estrogen, BZA TSEC effects preventing diabetisity ovariectomized mice high-fat feeding. Estrogen, BZA TSEC prevented fat accumulation adipose tissue, liver skeletal muscle, improved insulin resistance glucose intolerance without stimulating uterine growth. Estrogen, BZA TSEC improved energy homeostasis increasing lipid oxidation energy expenditure, promoted insulin action enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose disposal suppressing hepatic glucose production. estrogen improved metabolic homeostasis, least partially, increasing hepatic production FGF21, BZA increased hepatic expression Sirtuin1, PPARalpha AMPK activity. metabolic benefits BZA lost estrogen receptor-alpha deficient mice. Thus, BZA alone TSEC produces metabolic signals fasting caloric restriction improves energy glucose homeostasis female mice.
