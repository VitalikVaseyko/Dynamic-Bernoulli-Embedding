 presence glucose ample oxygen, insect form African trypanosomes release pyruvate 100-fold slowly bloodstream forms. rate decrease could accounted simply increased mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation rate inhibiting mitochondrial respiration increases pyruvate efflux rates 2-3% observed bloodstream form trypanosomes. Alternatively, decreased pyruvate efflux insect form trypanosomes could accounted decreased pyruvate transporter activity, which, surprisingly, nearly high insect form trypanosomes reported us earlier bloodstream forms (J.P. Barnard, B. Reynafarje, P.L. Pedersen (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3654-3661). Rather, low pyruvate efflux rate appears due primarily reduced levels enzyme pyruvate kinase, which, contrast conclusions earlier study, readily detected insect form trypanosomes absence added activators activity level 4% found bloodstream forms. Insect form pyruvate kinase seems located cytosol exhibits kinetic profiles constants nearly identical reported us earlier bloodstream form enzyme (J.P. Barnard, P.L. Pedersen (1988) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 31, 141-148). suggested reduced levels pyruvate kinase, hence reduced pyruvate efflux rates, insect form trypanosomes result regulation gene encoding cytosolic enzyme.
