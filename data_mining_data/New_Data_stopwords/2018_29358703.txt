 Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3)-regulated production reactive oxygen species (ROS) positively feeds back tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necroptosis, type programmed necrosis. Glutamine catabolism known contribute RIP3-mediated ROS induction, major contributor unknown. Here, show RIP3 activates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC, also known PDH), rate-limiting enzyme linking glycolysis aerobic respiration, directly phosphorylating PDC E3 subunit (PDC-E3) T135. Upon activation, PDC enhances aerobic respiration subsequent mitochondrial ROS production. Unexpectedly, mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) also required induction aerobic respiration, show required RIP3 translocation meet mitochondria-localized PDC. data uncover regulation mechanism PDC activity, show PDC activation RIP3 likely major mechanism activated TNF increase aerobic respiration by-product ROS, suggest RIP3-dependent induction aerobic respiration contributes pathologies related oxidative stress.
