 Rats exposed 12% O2 (1 atm) 48 hr, 10% O2 duration exposures. Significant elevations enzymes glutathione peroxidase system found lungs rats killed 3.5, 7.5, 12.5 days exposure compared air-breathing controls. Superoxide dismutase also elevated hypoxia nonsignificantly. Animals killed 12.5 days exposures exhibited 75% (P less 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reactive products lungs compared controls. results along significant increases lung lipid peroxidation augmentation protective antiperoxidative lung defense capabilities. Hypoxia also resulted enzyme elevations lung phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, may indicate adaptive increase lung glycolytic capabilities would helpful maintaining lung tissue energy requirements hypoxia. addition, confirmed red blood cell count, hemoglobin hematocrit values increased prolonged hypoxia. results study might also reflect enzyme elevation/induction due cellular reparative-proliferative processes following hypoxia.
