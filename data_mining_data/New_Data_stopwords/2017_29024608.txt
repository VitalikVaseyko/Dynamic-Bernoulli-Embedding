 Warburg metabolism, suppression mitochondrial metabolism contributes low cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio favoring enhanced aerobic glycolysis. Flux metabolites across mitochondrial outer membrane occurs voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC). cancer cells, free dimeric tubulin induces VDAC closure dynamically regulates mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi). Erastin, small molecule binds VDAC, antagonizes inhibitory effect tubulin VDAC hyperpolarizes mitochondria intact cells. Here, aim identify novel compounds ChemBridge DIVERSet library block inhibitory effect tubulin DeltaPsi using cell-based screening. HCC4006 cells treated nocodazole (NCZ) increase free tubulin decrease DeltaPsi presence absence library compounds. Tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) fluorescence assessed high-content imaging determine changes DeltaPsi. Compounds considered positive DeltaPsi increased presence NCZ. Using confocal microscopy, identified validated six lead molecules antagonized depolarizing effect NCZ. Lead compounds erastin promote microtubule stabilization, changes DeltaPsi independent tubulin dynamics. potent lead compound also decreased lactate formation. novel small molecules represent potential new class anti-Warburg drugs.
