 N-terminal portions two forms pyruvate kinase (EC2.7.1.40) Escherichia coli sequenced 48th 43rd residue, respectively. Comparison known primary structures shows bacterial enzymes lack substantial portion N-terminal sequence respect pyruvate kinases vertebrates. makes suggested functional role N-terminal domain unlikely [Muirhead, H. (1990) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 18, 193-196] although elongation domain evolution apparent.
