 Metastasis one main causes breast cancer (BCa)-related deaths female. reported cancer stem cell played important role metastasis. first revealed specific role pyruvate kinase isozymes M2 (PKM2) stemness breast cancer cells. Breast cancer tissue analysis confirmed upregulation PKM2 breast cancer, high PKM2 levels associated poor prognosis breast cancer patients. Holoclone assay colony formation assay significantly elucidated role PKM2 self-renewal breast cancer cells. Moreover, PKM2 elevated proportion stem cell ability sphere formation breast cancer cells. PKM2 played functional role stemness regulating beta-catenin. Collectively, identified critical roles PKM2 stemness breast cancer cells may elevate therapeutic effect breast cancer patients.
