 erythrocyte enzyme activities twenty-six cases myelodysplastic syndromes determined. remarkably abnormal levels seven cases; namely, four cases showed increased hexokinase activity, three cases showed increased pyruvate kinase activity, two cases showed increased adenosine deaminase activity. Among these, one case elevated pyruvate kinase activity showed novel expression M2-type pyruvate kinase activity, addition R-type pyruvate kinase activity normally found erythrocytes. Southern blotting peripheral leucocyte DNA revealed amplified PK-LR genome, derived chromosomal abnormality 1;7 translocation. mechanism responsible switching M2-type R-type erythroid maturation considered partially disrupted case.
