 reported treating cancer cells dichloroacetate (DCA), approved treatment congenital lactic acidosis, reverses Warburg effect inhibits tumor growth). Furthermore, omeprazole (OMP) well-known agent enhances effects anticancer drugs. aim study find clinically-used drugs enhance effects DCA. combination DCA OMP exhibited potent antitumor activity DCA alone HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells RKO colon cancer cells, drugs affect proliferation WI-38 human fibroblasts. inhibitory effect DCA combined OMP reversed vitamin E Z-VAD-FMK; therefore conventional caspase-dependent cell growth inhibition superoxide production suggested mechanism inhibition. combination drugs also effect HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells inoculated mice. Since OMP DCA may administered orally used clinically several years without major side effects, believe combination therapy could readily translated treat malignant tumors.
