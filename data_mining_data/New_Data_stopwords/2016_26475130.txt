 INTRODUCTION: Cinnamon currently marketed remedy obesity, glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus dyslipidaemia. Integrative medicine new concept combines conventional treatment evidence-based complementary therapies. AIM: aim review critically evaluate experimental evidence available cinnamon improving glycaemic targets animal models humans. RESULTS: Insulin receptor auto-phosphorlylation de-phosphorylation, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4 ) receptor synthesis translocation, modulation hepatic glucose metabolism changes Pyruvate kinase (PK) Phosphenol Pyruvate Carboxikinase (PEPCK), altering expression PPAR (gamma) inhibition intestinal glucosidases mechanisms responsible improving glycaemic control cinnamon therapy. reviewed 8 clinical trials used Cinnamomum cassia aqueous powder form doses ranging 500 mg 6 g per day duration lasting 40 days 4 months well 2 clinical trials used cinnamon treatment naive patients pre-diabetes. improvement glycaemic control seen patients received Cinnamon sole therapy diabetes, pre-diabetes (IFG IGT) high pre-treatment HbA1c. animal models, cinnamon reduced fasting postprandial plasma glucose HbA1c. CONCLUSION: Cinnamon potential useful add-on therapy discipline integrative medicine managing type 2 diabetes. present evidence inconclusive long-term trials aiming establish efficacy safety cinnamon needed. However, high coumarin content Cinnamomum cassia concern, Cinnamomum zeylanicum low coumarin content would safer alternate.
