 Metastatic tumors often hypoxic exhibiting decrease extracellular pH (~6.5) due metabolic transition described Warburg Effect. shift tumor cell metabolism alters tumor milieu inducing tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell motility, invasiveness, often resistance common anti-cancer treatments; hence hindering treatment aggressive cancers. result, tumors exhibiting phenotype directly associated poor prognosis decreased survival rates cancer patients. key component tumor microenvironment carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX). Knockdown CA IX expression inhibition activity shown reduce primary tumor growth, tumor proliferation, also decrease tumor resistance conventional anti-cancer therapies. several approaches taken target CA IX tumors via small-molecule, anti-body, RNAi delivery systems. review recent developments exploited approaches provide thoughts future directions CA IX targeting treatment cancer.
