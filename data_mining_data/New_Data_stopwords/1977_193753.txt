 surgical specimen solitary, encapsulated tumor tissue obtained 52-year-old male, diagnosed histologically well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (Grade II, Edmondson Steiner) liver cirrhosis, Type A' (and B parts), found supernormal level pyruvate kinase Type L subnormal level Type M2; activities (units/mg protein) 1.21 0.12 respectively. resulting isozyme pattern apparently "superdifferentiated" compared tumor-bearing, cirrhotic liver (Type L, 0.19; Type M2, 0.67) also normal liver (Type L, 0.47+/-0.05; Type M2, 0.18+/-0.02). electrophoretic kinetic properties type L isozyme identical cirrhotic host liver non-cirrhotic control liver. enzyme levels hepatoma tissue follows: Glucose-6-phosphatase, norma; fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, reduced; glucokinase, absent; hexokinase Types III, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, slightly increased. serum alpha-fetoprotein level 95 ng/ml. whole enzyme profile consistent minimal deviation hepatomas rats. results compared human hepatomas, mechanisms disordered regulation hepatoma gene expression discussed.
