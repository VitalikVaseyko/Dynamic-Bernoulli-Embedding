 Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) functional pollen produced important roles wheat breeding. anther unique organ male gametogenesis abnormal development cause male sterility. However, mechanisms regulatory networks related plant male sterility poorly understood. study, conducted comparative analyses using isobaric tags relative absolute quantification (iTRAQ) pollen proteins CMS line wheat maintainer. Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) analyzed based Gene Ontology classifications, metabolic pathways transcriptional regulation networks using Blast2GO. identified 5570 proteins based 23,277 peptides, matched 73,688 spectra, including proteins key pathways glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructokinase 1 glycolysis pathway, isocitrate dehydrogenase citrate synthase tricarboxylic acid cycle nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dehydrogenase adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) synthases oxidative phosphorylation pathway. proteins may comprise network regulates male sterility wheat. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, ATP assays total sugar assays validated iTRAQ results. DAPs could associated abnormal pollen grain formation male sterility. findings provide insights molecular mechanism related male sterility wheat.
