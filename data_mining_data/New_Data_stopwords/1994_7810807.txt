 Leishmania parasites isolated two patients cutaneous leishmaniasis geographically different localities Paraguay characterized enzyme electrophoresis (zymodeme) digestion profiles kinetoplast DNA restriction enzymes (schizodeme). Paraguayan isolates showed identical zymodeme profiles using 14 enzymes (glutamic pyruvate transaminase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, enolase, fumarate hydratase, glucose phosphate isomerase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, mannose phosphate isomerase, nucleoside phosphorylase, peptidase-D, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase, pyruvate kinase). Although two Paraguayan isolates showed different zymodeme profiles six Leishmania reference strains Old New World Leishmania species, showed identical zymodeme profiles L. major-like parasite Ecuador. observations confirmed schizodeme analysis using three restriction endonucleases (Msp I, Hae III, Taq I). results indicate Leishmania parasites isolated Paraguay identified L. major-like parasite, necessary consider existence L. major-like parasites classifying Leishmania isolates New World.
