 Understanding energy metabolism related proteins influence neural progenitor cells adult tissues critical developing new strategies clinical tissue regeneration therapy. recently reported subtoxic concentration glutamate-induced neural progenitor cells mature ex vivo rat retina. herein explore changes metabolic pathways process. firstly observed increase lactate lactate dehydrogenase concentration glutamate-treated retina. investigated levels glycolytic enzymes confirmed significant upregulation pyruvate kinase type (PKM), especially PKM2, enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH1) glutamate-treated retina compared untreated retina. analysis subcellular localization PKM2 revealed nuclear translocation treated retina, reported regulate cell cycle proliferation glycolytic enzymes. findings indicate mature rat retina undergoes increase aerobic glycolysis. PKM2, cytoplasm nucleus, may thus play important role neural progenitor cell induction, proliferating cells.
