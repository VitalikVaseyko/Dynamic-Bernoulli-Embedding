 Protein investment costs considered major driver choice alternative metabolic strategies. tested premise Lactococcus lactis, bacterium exhibits distinct, anaerobic version bacterial Crabtree/Warburg effect; increasing growth rates shifts high yield metabolic mode [mixed-acid fermentation; 3 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per glucose] low yield metabolic mode (homolactic fermentation; 2 ATP per glucose). studied growth rate-dependent relative transcription protein ratios, enzyme activities, fluxes L. lactis glucose-limited chemostats, providing high-quality comprehensive data set. three- fourfold higher growth rate rerouted metabolism acetate lactate main fermentation product. However, observed hardly changes transcription, protein levels enzyme activities. Even levels ribosomal proteins, constituting major investment cellular machinery, changed slightly. Thus, contrary original hypothesis, central metabolism organism appears hardly regulated level gene expression, rather metabolic level. conclude L. lactis either poorly adapted growth low constant glucose concentrations, protein costs play less important role fitness hitherto assumed.
