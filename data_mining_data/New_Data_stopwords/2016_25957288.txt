 PURPOSE: Myxopapillary ependymoma (MPE) distinct histologic variant ependymoma arising commonly spinal cord. Despite overall favorable prognosis, distant metastases, subarachnoid dissemination, late recurrences reported. Currently, effective treatment MPE gross-total resection. characterized genomic transcriptional landscape spinal ependymomas effort delineate genetic basis disease identify new leads therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling performed 35 spinal ependymomas, copy number profiling done overlapping cohort 46 spinal ependymomas. Functional validation experiments performed tumor lysates consisting assays measuring pyruvate kinase activity (PKM), hexokinase activity (HK), lactate production. RESULTS: gene expression level, demonstrate spinal grade II MPE molecularly biologically distinct. supported specific copy number alterations occurring histologic variant. Pathway analysis revealed MPE characterized increased cellular metabolism, associated upregulation HIF1alpha. findings validated Western blot analysis demonstrating increased protein expression HIF1alpha, HK2, PDK1, phosphorylation PDHE1A. Functional assays performed MPE lysates, demonstrated decreased PKM activity, increased HK activity, elevated lactate production. CONCLUSIONS: findings suggest MPE may driven Warburg metabolic phenotype. key enzymes promoting Warburg phenotype: HK2, PKM2, PDK targetable small-molecule inhibitors/activators, considered evaluation future clinical trials MPE.
