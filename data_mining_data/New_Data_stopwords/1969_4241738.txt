 1. Extracts Acetobacter xylinum found contain glycolytic enzymes involved conversion triose phosphate pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase lowest relative activity. Phosphofructokinase activity detected extracts. 2. slight differences activity pyruvate kinase observed cells grown glucose grown intermediates tricarboxylic acid cycle. 3. Pyruvate kinase, partially purified ultrasonic extracts ammonium sulphate fractionation, required Mg(2+) ions activity. activated K(+) NH(4) (+) ions. 4. plots representing relationship initial velocity phosphoenolpyruvate concentration sigmoidal, suggesting co-operative effect phosphoenolpyruvate. Hill coefficient (n) phosphoenolpyruvate 2. rate reaction changed increasing ADP concentrations according normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 5. enzyme inhibited ATP (K(i)0.9x10(-3)m). inhibition competitive regard ADP regard phosphoenolpyruvate. relieved excess Mg(2+) ions. 6. possible relationship properties pyruvate kinase regulatory mechanisms controlling gluconeogenesis carbohydrate oxidation A. xylinum discussed.
