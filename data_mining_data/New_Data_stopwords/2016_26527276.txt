 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key enzyme glycolysis catalyzes conversion phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate, supplies cellular energy. PKM2 also phosphorylates histone H3 threonine 11 (H3T11); however, largely unknown PKM2 links cellular metabolism chromatin regulation. Here, show yeast PKM2 homolog, Pyk1, part novel protein complex named SESAME (Serine-responsive SAM-containing Metabolic Enzyme complex), contains serine metabolic enzymes, SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) synthetases, acetyl-CoA synthetase. SESAME interacts Set1 H3K4 methyltransferase complex, requires SAM synthesized SESAME, recruits SESAME target genes, resulting phosphorylation H3T11. SESAME regulates crosstalk H3K4 methylation H3T11 phosphorylation sensing glycolysis glucose-derived serine metabolism. leads auto-regulation PYK1 expression. Thus, study provides insights mechanism regulating gene expression, responding cellular metabolism via chromatin modifications.
