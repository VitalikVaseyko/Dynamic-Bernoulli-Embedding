 Control coenzyme (CoA) synthesis studied isolated perfused rat hearts. data obtained support hypothesis phosphorylation pantothenic acid pantothenate kinase flux-generating reaction pathway CoA synthesis. reaction operated cell far removed thermodynamic equilibrium; saturated substrates conditions studied; concentration substrate changed opposite direction flux flux altered. reaction subject control external factors associated oxidation glucose, pyruvate, palmitate. CoA synthesis 4'-phosphopantothenic acid inhibited glucose pyruvate, suggesting pantothenate kinase reaction pathway controlled isolated hearts. Maximum rates CoA synthesis perfused hearts pantothenate kinase stimulation dependent supply exogenous cysteine. Perfusate [14C]cysteine incorporated intermediates pathway CoA. protected oxidation cystine low concentrations dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM cysteine perfusate resulted maximum rates CoA synthesis. Evidence obtained indicates addition cysteine relieves substrate limitation 4'-phosphopantothenyl cysteine synthase reaction.
