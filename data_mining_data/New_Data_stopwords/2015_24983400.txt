 Abstract Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients treated red ginseng, contains protopanxadiol protopanaxatriol ginsenosides main constituents, reported remain healthy >20 years absence highly active antiretroviral therapy. ginsenosides, ginsenoside Rh1, protopanaxatriol ginsenoside, known eliminate cytoprotective HIV-1-infected macrophages inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1 (PDK-1) phosphorylation. study, investigated capacity ginsenoside Rb1, protopanaxadiol ginsenoside, eliminate cytoprotective primary human macrophages. found ginsenoside Rb1 could also eliminate cytoprotective primary human macrophages infected HIV-1 D3. Ginsenoside Rb1 inhibited lipopolysaccharide/cycloheximide-induced AKT glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation D3-transduced macrophages, phosphorylation PDK-1 phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). Furthermore, also observed combined treatment ginsenoside Rb1 miltefosine synergistically abolished cytoprotective CHME5 cells expressing HIV-1 tat. Based findings, conclude ginsenoside Rb1 eliminate cytoprotective macrophages infected HIV-1 inhibiting AKT pathway.
