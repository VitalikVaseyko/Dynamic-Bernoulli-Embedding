 OBJECTIVE: Gliomas common primary brain tumors, ranked fourth leading cause cancer death. Tumor mesenchymal-like stem cells (tMSCs) contribute aggressive behavior glial tumors providing favorable microenvironment malignant cells. aim study identify differential proteome tMSCs derived low vs. high grade glioma tumors. MATERIALS METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed low high grade gliomas included case control study. tMSCs isolated tumors using enzymatic digestion validated flow cytometer analysis sub-culturing. Differential proteomic analysis tMSCs derived low high grade tumors performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry. Protein spots two fold differences P values 0.05 considered differentially expressed ones. RESULTS: tMSCs isolated low high grade gliomas, different isoforms mesenchymal-related proteins vimentin transgelin differentially expressed. Overexpressed proteins tMSCs isolated low grade gliomas mitochondrial manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), 40S ribosomal protein SA, GTP-binding nuclear protein, tMSCs isolated high grade gliomas, cathepsin B, endoplasmin, ezrin, peroxiredoxin1, pyruvate kinase (PK) found significantly overexpressed. CONCLUSION: first time, analyzed differential proteomic profiles tMSCs isolated glioma tumors different grades. found molecules related mesenchymal cells (vimentin transglin), addition related tumor aggressiveness potential secretory behavior (e.g. cathepsin B) among differentially expressed proteins.
