 Anoxia compared ischaemia. abrupt restoration either oxygen flow may accelerate cardiac damage. Anoxic stimulation glycolysis (Pasteur effect) inhibited ischaemia lactate proton accumulation levels phosphofructokinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Anaerobic glycolysis provides lactate ATP; breakdown latter provides protons. partial respiration thought occur partial ischaemia, continued production CO2 factor contributing intracellular acidosis; mitochondrial ATP formed continued respiration also yields protons ultimately broken down. endoproducts aerobic glycolysis (pyruvate NADH) transported mitochondria malate-aspartate cycle pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Adenine nucleotide transferase activity normally transfers mitochondrially-made ATP cytoplasm, acyl CoA accumulates ischaemia (or perfusions high circulating free fatty acids) inhibit transferase. mitochondrial creatine kinase thought transform ATP transported outwards creatine phosphate permeate outer mitochondrial membrane. compartmentation ATP may creatine kinase isoenzymes relation cell membrane. glycogenolytic-sarcoplasmic reticulum complex links glycogen pool sarcoplasmic reticulum. Cyclic AMP may regulate admission calcium cell plateau action potential promote calcium uptake sarcoplasmic reticulum phosphorylation phospholamban. latter promotes activity calcium-transport ATPase. Calcium cyclic AMP may also interact level contractile proteins cyclic AMP phosphrylates troponin. Cyclic GMP generally opposite effects cyclic AMP undergoes opposite changes frog cardiac cycle cyclic AMP. present reasonable suppose physiological effects adrenaline cholinergic agents myocardium mediated cyclic AMP cyclic GMP, respectively, hypothesis still lacks firm support. association tissue cyclic AMP ventricular fibrillation coronary ligation, direct evidence role cyclic AMP promoting arrhythmias obtained studies ventricular fibrillation threshold rat heart. However, mechanisms, involving first effects substrates action potential duration, secondly, fast channel, also give rise development malignant arrhythmias.
