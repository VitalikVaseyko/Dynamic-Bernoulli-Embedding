 Bifidobacteria widely used probiotics several commercial products; however, date little knowledge carbohydrate metabolic pathways. work, studied metabolism glucose lactose widely used probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 vivo (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. metabolism [1-(13)C]glucose characterized cells grown glucose sole carbon source. Moreover, metabolism lactose specifically labeled (13)C carbon 1 glucose galactose moiety determined suspensions cells grown lactose. experiments allowed quantification intermediate end products metabolic pathways, well determination consumption rate carbon sources. Additionally, labeling patterns metabolites derived metabolism glucose specifically labeled (13)C carbon 1, 2, 3 cells grown glucose lactose specifically labeled carbon 1 glucose moiety ([1-(13)Cglucose]lactose), lactose specifically labeled carbon 1 galactose moiety ([1-(13)Cgalactose]lactose), [1-(13)C]glucose lactose-grown cells determined cell extracts (13)C NMR. NMR analysis showed recovery carbon fully compatible fructose 6-phosphate, bifid, shunt. activity lactate dehydrogenase, acetate kinase, fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase, pyruvate formate lyase differed significantly glucose lactose cultures. transcriptional analysis several putative glucose lactose transporters showed significant induction Balat_0475 presence lactose, suggesting role protein lactose permease. report provides first vivo experimental evidence metabolic flux distribution catabolic pathway glucose lactose bifidobacteria shows bifid shunt pathway involved energy recruitment two sugars. basis experimental results, model sugar metabolism B. animalis subsp. lactis proposed.
