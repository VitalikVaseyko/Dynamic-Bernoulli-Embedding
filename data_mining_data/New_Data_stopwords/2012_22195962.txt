 Many tumor cells rely aerobic glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation continued proliferation survival. Myc HIF-1 believed promote metabolic switch by, part, upregulating gene expression pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 1 (PDHK1), phosphorylates inactivates mitochondrial PDH consequently pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). report tyrosine phosphorylation enhances PDHK1 kinase activity promoting ATP PDC binding. Functional PDC form mitochondria outside matrix cancer cells PDHK1 commonly tyrosine phosphorylated human cancers diverse oncogenic tyrosine kinases localized different mitochondrial compartments. Expression phosphorylation-deficient, catalytic hypomorph PDHK1 mutants cancer cells leads decreased cell proliferation hypoxia increased oxidative phosphorylation enhanced mitochondrial utilization pyruvate reduced tumor growth xenograft nude mice. Together, tyrosine phosphorylation activates PDHK1 promote Warburg effect tumor growth.
