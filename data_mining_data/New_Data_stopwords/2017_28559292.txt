 Intracellular bacterial pathogens exploit host cell resources replicate survive inside host. Targeting host systems one promising approach developing novel antimicrobials treat intracellular infections. show human macrophage-like cells infected Brucella abortus undergo metabolic shift characterized attenuated tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism, reduced amino acid consumption, altered mitochondrial localization, increased lactate production. shift aerobic glycolytic state resembles Warburg effect, change energy production well described cancer cells also occurs activated inflammatory cells. B. abortus efficiently uses lactic acid sole carbon energy source requires ability metabolize lactate normal survival human macrophage-like cells. demonstrate chemical inhibitors host glycolysis lactate production affect vitro growth B. abortus axenic culture decrease survival intracellular niche. data support model infection shifts host metabolism Warburg-like state, B. abortus uses change metabolism promote intracellular survival. Pharmacological perturbation features host cell metabolism may useful strategy inhibit infection intracellular pathogens.IMPORTANCEBrucella spp. intracellular bacterial pathogens cause disease range mammals, including livestock. Transmission livestock humans common lead chronic human disease. Human macrophage-like cells infected Brucella abortus undergo Warburg-like metabolic shift aerobic glycolytic state host cells produce lactic acid reduced amino acid catabolism. provide evidence pathogen exploit change host metabolism support growth survival intracellular niche. Drugs inhibit shift host cell metabolism inhibit intracellular replication decrease survival B. abortus vitro infection model; drugs may broadly useful therapeutics intracellular infections.
