 investigated mechanism cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promoting invasion metastasis pancreatic cancer cells non-vascular manner. verified original generation isolated cultured CAFs normal fibroblasts (NFs) based expression alpha-SMA vimentin, examined cell glycolysis level glucose consumption lactate production experiments. mRNA protein expression CAF glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase m2, examined RT-PCR western blotting, respectively. vitro culture first-generation pancreatic CAFs collected cultured together pancreas cancer BxPc-3 Panc-1 cells. Cell invasion migration assessed using Transwell assay scratch test, respectively. Mitochondrial activity assessed experimentally determining oxidative phosphorylation (OP) activity. aerobic oxidation index cancer cells also examined. Succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase (FH), monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expression examined using MCT1-specific inhibitor remove 'tumor-stromal' metabolic coupling observe influence cell interstices pancreas cancer progression. First-generation isolated cultured CAFs NFs grew well, showed active proliferation. Glucose absorption lactate production significantly enhanced CAFs compared NFs. PCR western blotting showed lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase m2 mRNA protein expression levels increased CAFs. indirect co-culture, OP increased BxPc-3 Panc-1 cells; correspondingly, succinate dehydrogenase, FH MCT expression increased. MCT1-specific inhibitor removed 'tumor-stromal' metabolic coupling, migration invasion abilities pancreatic cancer cells decreased. Pancreatic CAFs alter metabolism well communicate respond cancer cell migration invasion. may important mechanism promoting tumor progression non-vascular manner tumor microenvironment. mechanism CAFs reshape metabolic transition requires analysis.
