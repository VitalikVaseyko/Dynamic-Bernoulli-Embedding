 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) may occur tetrameric dimeric form. majority PKM2 molecules highly active tetrameric conformation, glucose primarily degraded pyruvate lactate regeneration energy. tumor suppressor protein, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), interacts PKM2 protein stabilizes PKM2 active tetrameric form normal proliferating cells. However, DAPK widely inactivated cancer cells, leading loss active conformation PKM2. may render PKM2 sensitive cellular oxidants, switching enzyme inactive dimeric form. Consequently, inhibition PKM2 oxidative stress contributes optimal tumor growth allows cancer cells withstand oxidative stress.
