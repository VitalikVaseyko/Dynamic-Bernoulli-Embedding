 Prostate cancer common non-cutaneous cancer men United States. Cancer metabolism emerged contemporary topic great interest improved mechanistic understanding tumorigenesis. Prostate cancer disease model great interest metabolic perspective. Prostatic tissue exhibits unique metabolic activity baseline conditions. Benign prostate cells accumulate zinc, excess zinc inhibits citrate oxidation metabolism within citric acid cycle, effectively resulting citrate production. Malignant cells, however, actively oxidize citrate resume typical citric acid cycle function. interest, prostate cancer exhibit Warburg effect, increase glucose uptake, seen many cancers. cellular metabolic differences others clinical interest present variety potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, understanding metabolic profile differences benign prostate versus low- high-grade prostate cancers also represents avenue better understand cancer progression potentially develop new diagnostic testing. paper, review current state knowledge metabolic phenotypes prostate cancer.
