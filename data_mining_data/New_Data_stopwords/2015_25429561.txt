 Microglia-induced neuroinflammation important pathological mechanism influencing various neurodegenerative disorders. Excess activation microglia produces myriad proinflammatory mediators decimate neurons. Hence, therapeutic strategies aimed suppress activation microglia might lead advancements treatment neurodegenerative diseases. study, synthesized novel ethyl pyruvate derivative, named EOP (S-ethyl 2-oxopropanethioate) studied effects lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production nitric oxide (NO) rat primary microglia mouse BV-2 microglia. EOP significantly decreased production NO, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta tumor necrosis factor-alpha, LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia. phosphorylation levels extracellular regulated kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear translocation NF-kappaB also inhibited EOP LPS-activated BV-2 microglial cells. Overall, observations indicate EOP might promising therapeutic agent diminish development neurodegenerative diseases associated microglia activation.
