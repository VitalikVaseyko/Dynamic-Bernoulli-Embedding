 BACKGROUND AIM: White opaque substance (WOS) novel endoscopic finding gastric neoplasms, indicating intracellular accumulation lipid droplets (LDs). However, gastric lipid metabolism extensively investigated, even normal mucosa. investigated expression profiles lipid-metabolism-associated genes gastric neoplasms. METHODS: Thirty-four patients early gastric cancer adenoma enrolled study. Paired biopsy samples tumor adjacent non-tumor areas obtained analyzed real-time polymerase chain reaction. Endoscopically resected specimens evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS: Genes associated beta-oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), lipoprotein excretion (apolipoprotein B, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2), fatty acid transport (fatty acid-binding protein), construction triglycerides endoplasmic reticulum (acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1), LD degradation/lipolysis (comparative gene identification-58, adipose triglyceride lipase) significantly downregulated neoplasms compared non-tumor areas. Pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 (negative regulator glycolysis) adipophilin (LD surface component) also repressed. Conversely, expression levels genes associated de novo lipogenesis (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2) significantly enhanced neoplasms. significant difference gene expression levels carcinomas adenomas, WOS-positive WOS-negative neoplasms. CONCLUSION: Gene expression profiles neoplasms suggest predominance lipid storage (lipogenesis/LD formation) consumption (beta-oxidation/excretion/lipolysis). Lipid accumulation WOS gastric epithelial neoplasms may caused impaired mitochondrial oxidation, lipoprotein excretion, LD degradation.
