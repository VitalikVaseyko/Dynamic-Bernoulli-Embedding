 Neuroblastoma (NB) pediatric malignancy characterized marked reduction aerobic energy metabolism. Recent preclinical data indicate targeting metabolic phenotype ketogenic diet (KD), especially combination calorie restriction, slows tumor growth enhances metronomic cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy NB xenografts. calorie restriction would contraindicated cancer patients, aim present study optimize KD tumors sensitized CP without need calorie restriction. NB xenograft model, metronomic CP combined KDs different triglyceride compositions fed CD1-nu mice ad libitum. Metronomic CP combination KD containing 8-carbon medium-chain triglycerides exerted robust anti-tumor effect, suppressing growth causing significant reduction tumor blood-vessel density intratumoral hemorrhage, accompanied activation AMP-activated protein kinase NB cells. Furthermore, KDs caused significant reduction serum levels essential amino acids, increased serine, glutamine glycine. data suggest targeting energy metabolism modified KD may considered part multimodal treatment regimen improve efficacy classic anti-NB therapy.
