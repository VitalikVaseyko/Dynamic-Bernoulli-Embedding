 previously observed glucose deprivation induces cell death multidrug-resistant human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7/ADR). follow wished test hypothesis metabolic oxidative stress causative process least link causative processes behind cytotoxicity. studies described here, demonstrate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activated within 3 min glucose-free medium remained activated 3 h. Glucose deprivation 2-4 h also caused oxidative stress evidenced 3-fold greater steady state concentration oxidized glutathione 3-fold increase pro-oxidant production. Glucose glutamate treatment rapidly suppressed MAPK activation rescued cells cytotoxicity. Glutamate peroxide scavenger, pyruvate, rescued cells cell killing well suppressed pro-oxidant production. addition thiol antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, rescued cells glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity suppressed MAPK activation. results suggest glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity alterations MAPK signal transduction mediated oxidative stress MCF-7/ADR. results also support speculation common mechanism glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity mammalian cells may involve metabolic oxidative stress.
