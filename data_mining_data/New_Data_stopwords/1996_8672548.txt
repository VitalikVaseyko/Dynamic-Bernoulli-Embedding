 provision high-fat diet (47% energy fat) 28 days led significant increase hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity, together significant suppression hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase (active form). enhanced hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity continued observed 6 h withdrawal high-fat diet. Significant suppression hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity observed post-absorptive, high-fat-fed rats 2.5 h euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp, differences pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activities control high-fat-fed rats longer evident. Starvation 24 h rats previously maintained standard diet also evoked substantial increase hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity. latter response partially reversed 2.5 h euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia. Suppression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity 2.5 h euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia high-fat-fed rats associated substantial increase hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (active form) whereas significant increase hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (active form) observed 2.5 h euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia 24 h-starved rats. results consistent proposition hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase responds directly increase lipid oxidation facilitated insulin deficiency impaired action insulin.
