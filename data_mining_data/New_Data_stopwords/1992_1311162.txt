 25Mg NMR spectroscopy used study interactions activating cations respective binding sites enzymes yeast enolase rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK). Titration Mg2+ enolase allows calculation 1/T2 Mg2+ bound site 1510 s-1 quadrupolar coupling constant chi = 0.30 MHz. Titration Mg2+ enolase presence 2-phosphoglycerate (PGA) Zn2+, Zn2+ binds specifically site I, gives 1/T2 Mg2+ bound site II 4000 s-1 (chi = 0.49 MHz). Mg2+ site II appears anisotropic Mg2+ site I. titration site enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex Zn2+ Mn2+ shows simple displacement Mg2+. paramagnetic effects Mn2+ 25Mg relaxation observed. Temperature studies 25Mg resonance show fast exchange Mg2+ occurs conditions. lack paramagnetic effect, distance cations sites II must 6-9 A. distance limits location, hence function, cation site II catalytic activity. Titration Mg2+ PK gives 1/T2 bound Mg2+ 2200 s-1 (chi = 0.24 MHz). titration Mg2+ PK presence inhibitor oxalate gives 1/T2 400 s-1. temperature dependence 25Mg relaxation PK-Mg-oxalate complex consistent slow exchange (Ea = 6.1 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol). enzyme-bound cation tightly sequestered addition ligand binds directly cation. investigation 25Mg relaxation PK-Mn-oxalate-Mg-ATP complex, Mg2+ bound nucleotide Mn2+ enzyme bound, successful due precipitation PK experimental conditions short T2 relaxation 25Mg complex. applications 25Mg NMR useful partially describing properties bound Mg2+ two metal-requiring enzymes.
