 Survival near-freezing body temperatures reduced blood flow hibernation likely result changes expression specific genes. study, described comprehensive survey mRNAs heart thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) hibernation. heart chosen study contractile organ must continue work despite body temperatures 5 degrees C lack food periods 5-6 mo. used digital gene expression assay involving high-throughput sequencing directional cDNA libraries hearts active hibernating ground squirrels determine identity frequency 3,532 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Statistical analysis active hibernating heart expression profile indicated differential regulation 48 genes based P < = 0.03 threshold. Several differentially expressed genes identified screen encode proteins likely account uninterrupted cardiac function hibernation, including involved metabolism, contractility, Ca2+ handling, low-temperature catalysis. sampling genes showing higher expression hibernation includes phosphofructokinase, pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), aldolase A, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a), titin, four-and-a-half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2). Genes showing reduced levels expression hibernation include cyclin-dependent kinase 2-associated protein 1 (CDK2AP1), troponin C, phospholamban, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), calmodulin, four subunits cytochrome c oxidase.
