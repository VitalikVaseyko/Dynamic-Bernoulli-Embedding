 Cell proliferation process consumes large amounts energy. reduction nutrient supply lead cell death ATP depletion, cell proliferation limited. key sensor regulation glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase, determines whether glucose carbons channelled synthetic processes used glycolytic energy production. unicellular organisms pyruvate kinase regulated ATP, ADP AMP, ribose 5-P, precursor nucleic acid synthesis, glycolytic intermediate fructose 1,6-P2 (FBP), thereby adapting cell proliferation nutrient supply. mammalian pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK) displays kinetic properties pyruvate kinase enzyme unicellular organisms. mammalian M2-PK isoenzyme switch less active dimeric form highly active tetrameric form regulates channeling glucose carbons either synthetic processes (dimeric form) glycolytic energy production (tetrameric form). Tumor cells usually characterized high amount dimeric form leading strong accumulation glycolytic phosphometabolites pyruvate kinase. tetramer-dimer ratio regulated ATP, FBP serine direct interactions different oncoproteins (pp60v-src, HPV-16 E7). solid tumors sufficient oxygen supply pyruvate supplied glutaminolysis. Pyruvate produced glycolysis glutaminolysis used synthesis lactate, glutamate fatty acids thereby releasing hydrogen produced glycolytic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction.
