 activities three urea cycle enzymes, several nitrogen catabolic, gluconeogenic, lipogenic enzymes measured liver adult cats fed: commercial kibble; 17.5 70% protein purified diet, starved 5 days. Except increase tyrosine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.5) feeding high protein diet, changes activities hepatic enzymes influenced dietary protein level. Likewise, starvation minimal effect activities enzymes compared found similar experiments rats. results indicate cat may minimal capabilities enzyme adaptation compared found many herbivores omnivores may provide explanation cats unusually high protein requirement compared many mammals.
