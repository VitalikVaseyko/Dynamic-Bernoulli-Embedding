 PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling axis centrally involved cellular homeostasis controls cell growth proliferation. Due key function regulator cell survival metabolism, dysregulation pathway manifested several human pathologies including cancers immunological diseases. Thus, current therapeutic strategies target components signaling cascade. recent years, numerous feedback loops identified attenuate PI3K/PDK1/Akt-dependent signaling. Here, report identification additional level feedback regulation depends negative transcriptional control phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) class IA subunits. Genetic deletion 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) pharmacological inhibition downstream effectors, is, Akt mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), relieves suppression leads upregulation PI3K subunits, resulting enhanced generation phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Apparently, transcriptional induction mediated concerted action different transcription factor families, including transcription factors cAMP-responsive element-binding protein forkhead box O. Collectively, propose PDK1 functions cellular sensor balances basal PIP3 generation levels sufficient survival threshold harmful cell. study suggests efficiency therapies targeting aberrantly activated PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway might increased parallel blockade feedback circuits.
