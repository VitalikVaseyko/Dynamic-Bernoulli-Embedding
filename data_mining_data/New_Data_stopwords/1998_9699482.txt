 Glucose-regulated transcription L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene mediated glucose response element (GlRE/L4 box) composed two degenerated E-boxes. Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) component transcriptional glucose response complex built GlRE. Cooperation GlRE contiguous binding site (L3 box) orphan nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) also suggested. compared transient transfection assays effects USF2a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) factors (TFE3, c-Myc, SREBP/ADD1) activity glucose responsiveness minimal L-PK promoter directed oligomerized glucose response units (L4L3 boxes). found that: (i) although USF2a intrinsically moderate transcriptional activator, strong stimulatory effect activity L4L3-based reporter construct hepatocyte-derived cells interferes glucose responsiveness; (ii) despite potent ability transactivator, TFE3 alone barely active GlRE hepatocyte-derived cells; (iii) TFE3 USF2a acts synergistically HNF4 abolishes glucose responsiveness promoter overexpressed; (iv) contrast, overexpression HNF4 alone stimulates activity promoter without interfering glucose responsiveness; (v) SREBP/ADD1 weak activity L4L3 elements, detectable presence HNF4, c-Myc interact GIRE L-PK promoter. studies indicate different bHLH-LZ transcription factors known recognize CACGTG-type E-boxes equivalent acting L-PK glucose response element, USF proteins especially efficient hepatocyte-derived cells.
