 MMP11 overexpression bad prognostic factor various human carcinomas. Interestingly, proteinase expressed malignant cells secreted adjacent non-malignant mesenchymal/stromal cells, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) adipocytes (CAAs), favors cancer cell survival progression. MMP11 negatively regulates adipogenesis vitro, hypothesized may play role whole body metabolism energy homeostasis. used vivo gain- (Mmp11-Tg mice) loss- (Mmp11-/- mice) of-function approach address systemic function MMP11. Strikingly, MMP11 overexpression protects type 2 diabetes Mmp11-/- mice exhibit hallmarks metabolic syndrome. Moreover, Mmp11-Tg mice protected diet-induced obesity display mitochondrial dysfunction, due oxidative stress, metabolic switch oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis. Warburg-like effect observed adipose tissues might provide rationale deleterious impact CAA-secreted MMP11, favouring tumor progression. MMP11 overexpression also leads increased circulating IGF1 levels activation IGF1/AKT/FOXO1 cascade, important metabolic signalling pathway. data reveal major role MMP11 controlling energy metabolism, provide new clues understanding relationship metabolism, cancer progression patient outcome.
