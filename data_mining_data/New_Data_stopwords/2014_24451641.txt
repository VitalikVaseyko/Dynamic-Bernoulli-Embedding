 strong interest developing small molecules modulate protein-protein interactions (PPI), since compounds could serve drug leads probes protein function. Fragment-based ligand discovery particularly useful approach modulating PPI. Fragments typically <250 Da compounds bind proteins weak affinity high ligand efficiency. Here, review method fragment- based ligand discovery using covalent disulfide trapping (Tethering). Tethering uses native engineered cysteine residue select thiol-containing fragments bind protein near tethering cysteine. Taking advantage site-directed nature Tethering, one investigate 'druggability' particular binding sites protein surface; furthermore, Tethering used find new binding sites stabilize allosteric conformations. review principles Tethering discuss two examples disulfide trapping expanded understanding PPI. cytokine interleukin-2 (IL2), Tethering identified binding site adjacent IL2/IL2- receptor new site allosterically coupled PPI. kinase PDK1, Tethering identified ligands activated inhibited enzymatic activity bind-ing single allosteric site. examples provide context successful fragment-discovery projects, complementary technologies work together identify starting points chemical biology drug discovery.
