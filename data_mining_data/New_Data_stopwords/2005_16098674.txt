 study conducted explore relationship two isolates Neospora caninum (N. caninum) (KBA-2 VMDL-1) using proteomics. achieve goal, proteins N. caninum tachyzoite lysates KBA-2 VMDL-1 separated two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), stained silver-nitrate analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) compare protein profiles. addition, proteins separated 2-DE transferred membranes, probed bovine anti-N. caninum KBA-2 immunoglobulin G, reactive proteins visualized compared two isolates. spots 2-DE profiles antigenic spots 2-DE immunoblot profiles located similar locations terms isoelectric point molecular weight. Proteins common isolates included following: heat shock protein 70, subtilisin-like serine protease, nucleoside triphosphatase, heat shock protein 60, pyruvate kinase, tubulin alpha, tubulin beta, enolase, putative protein disulfide isomerase, actin, fructase-1,6-bisphosphatase, putative ribosomal protein S2, microneme protein Nc-P38, lactate dihydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase aldolase, serine threonine phosphatase 2C, 14-3-3 protein homologue, N. caninum dense granule-1 NcGRA2. consequence, even though N. caninum KBA-2 VMDL-1 isolates isolated geographically distinct locations significant homology proteome antigenic proteome profiles. addition, proteomic approach verified useful tool understanding host immune response different isolates protozoa.
