 Besnoitia besnoiti obligate intracellular emerging coccidian parasite cattle significant economic impact cattle industry. acute infection, fast-proliferating tachyzoites continuously formed mainly endothelial host cells infected animals. Given offspring formation highly energy cell building block demanding process, parasite needs exploit host cellular metabolism meet metabolic demands. Here, analyzed metabolic signatures B. besnoiti-infected endothelial host cells aimed influence parasite proliferation inhibitors specific metabolic pathways. following inhibitors tested: fluoro 2-deoxy-D-glucose 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG, DG; inhibitors glycolysis), 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucin (DON; inhibitor glutaminolysis), dichloroacetate (DCA; inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase favorites channeling glucose carbons TCA cycle) adenosine-monophosphate (AMP; inhibitor ribose 5-P synthesis). Overall, B. besnoiti infections bovine endothelial cells induced significant infection rate-dependent increase glucose, lactate, glutamine, glutamate, pyruvate, alanine, serine conversion rates together indicate parasite-triggered up-regulation glycolysis glutaminolysis. Thus, addition DON, FDG, DG cultivation medium B. besnoiti infected endothelial cells led dose-dependent inhibition parasite replication (4 muM DON, 99.5 % inhibition; 2 mM FDG, 99.1 % inhibition; 2 mM DG, 93 % inhibition; 8 mM DCA, 71.9 % inhibition). contrast, AMP significant effects total tachyzoite production concentration 20 mM. Together, data may open new strategies development therapeutics B. besnoiti infections.
