 high proliferative rate tumor cells leads metabolic needs distinct normal counterparts. embryonic- tumor-specific isoform enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) overexpressed cancer cells increase use glycolytic intermediates macromolecular biosynthesis tumor growth. report Cyclosporin (CsA) regulate expression activity PKM2 breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-435 MDA-MB-231. PKM2 found highly expressed three breast cancer cell lines compared normal primary breast cells. Treatment CsA inhibited viability breast cancer cells time- dose-dependent manner. CsA significantly downregulated expression PKM2 breast cancer cells decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, induced cancer cells undergo necrosis. Furthermore, growth suppression effect CsA impaired MCF-7 cells transfected PKM2 overexpression plasmid, suggesting CsA effective inhibitor PKM2-dependent proliferation breast cancer cells. results may provide new insights mechanism CsA cancer therapy.
