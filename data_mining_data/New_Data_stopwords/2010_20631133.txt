 mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) kinase acts cellular rheostat integrates signals variety cellular signal transduction pathways sense growth factor nutrient availability well intracellular energy status. previously reported human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 oncoprotein may activate S6 protein kinase (S6K) binding E6AP-mediated degradation mTOR inhibitor tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) (Z. Lu, X. Hu, Y. Li, L. Zheng, Y. Zhou, H. Jiang, T. Ning, Z. Basang, C. Zhang, Y. Ke, J. Biol. Chem. 279:35664-35670, 2004; L. Zheng, H. Ding, Z. Lu, Y. Li, Y. Pan, T. Ning, Y. Ke, Genes Cells 13:285-294, 2008). results confirmed HPV16 E6 expression causes increase mTORC1 activity enhanced phosphorylation mTOR activation downstream signaling pathways S6K eukaryotic initiation factor binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). However, detect decrease TSC2 levels HPV16 E6-expressing cells. discovered, however, HPV16 E6 expression causes AKT activation upstream kinases PDK1 mTORC2 conditions nutrient deprivation. show HPV16 E6 expression causes increase protein synthesis enhancing translation initiation complex assembly 5' mRNA cap increase cap-dependent translation. increase cap-dependent translation likely results HPV16 E6-induced AKT/mTORC1 activation, assembly translation initiation complex cap-dependent translation rapamycin sensitive. Lastly, coexpression HPV16 E6 E7 oncoproteins affect HPV16 E6-induced activation mTORC1 cap-dependent translation. HPV16 E6-mediated activation mTORC1 signaling cap-dependent translation may mechanism promote viral replication conditions limited nutrient supply differentiated, HPV oncoprotein-expressing proliferating cells.
