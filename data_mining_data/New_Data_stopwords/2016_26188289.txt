 order Candida species adhere colonize human host cells must express cell wall proteins (CWP) adapt reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated phagocytic cells human host respiratory burst. However, pathogens change expression CWP response oxidative stress (OSR) known. Here, fifteen moonlight-like CWP identified expressed differentially four species Candida exposed H2O2 menadione (O2(-)). proteins included: (i) glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba1), phosphoglycerate mutase (Gpm1), phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk), pyruvate kinase (Pk) enolase (Eno1); (ii) heat shock proteins Ssb1 Ssa2; (iii) OSR proteins peroxyredoxin (Tsa1), stress protein Ddr48 (Ddr48) glutathione reductase (Glr1); (iv) metabolic enzymes ketol-acid reductoisomerase (Ilv5) pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1); (v) proteins elongation factor 1-beta (Efb1) 14-3-3 protein homolog. RT-PCR revealed transcription genes coding identified CWP differentially regulated. knowledge first report showing moonlight-like CWP first line defense Candida ROS, differentially regulated pathogens.
