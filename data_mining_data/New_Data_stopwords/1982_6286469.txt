 Activated mouse spleen lymphocytes increased amounts glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. changes found hexokinase gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. Concanavalin A-activated cells give higher activities enzymes lipopolysaccharide-activated B lymphoblasts. Insulin treatment results stronger increment enzyme activity mitogen-activated cells. Insulin inhibits initial proliferation induced either Con LPS, 50% increase antibody-forming cells found LPS-treated cultures. Insulin may favour differentiation activated cells increasing rate glycolytic pathway.
