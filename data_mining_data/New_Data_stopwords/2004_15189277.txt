 AIMS: assessed changes gene expression hypertrophied liver portal vein ligation (PL) test group rats compared control group, size liver PL. METHODS: portal veins left median lobes test group ligated initial operation. Four days PL, liver volume posterior caudate lobe (5%) increased two-fold comprised 10% liver. 90% hepatectomy performed, leaving hypertrophied posterior caudate lobe, leaving normal anterior posterior caudate lobes (10%) control (sham) group. comparison expression profiles two groups performed using cDNA microarrays hepatic ATP level measured. RESULTS: survival rate PL group significantly higher sham group 4 days hepatectomy (56.3% 26.7%, P < 0.05). Gene expression cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin B upregulated, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor downregulated. Increases observed in: (i) pyruvate dehydrogenase, tricarboxylic acid cycle cycle regulator, (ii) acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, oxidation regulator, (iii) cytochrome oxidases, oxidative phosphorylation regulator. Hepatic ATP concentration hepatectomy better maintained PL group sham group (0.48 +/- 0.01 micromol/ml vs. 0.33 +/- 0.01 micromol/ml, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: regenerating liver increased tolerance extended hepatectomy compared normal liver. believed induced rapid regeneration remaining liver hepatectomy increases ATP metabolism.
