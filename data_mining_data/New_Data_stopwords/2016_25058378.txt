 PTEN-induced kinase-1 (PINK1) Ser/Thr kinase implicated familial early-onset Parkinson's disease, first reported growth suppressor. PINK1 loss-of-function compromises mitochondrial autophagy oxidative phosphorylation. report PINK1 deficiency triggers hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha) stabilization cultured Pink1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts primary cortical neurons well vivo. effect, mediated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, led upregulation HIF1 target, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, inhibits PDH activity. Furthermore, show HIF1alpha stimulates glycolysis absence Pink1, promotion intracellular glucose metabolism HIF1alpha stabilization required cell proliferation Pink1(-/-) mice. propose loss Pink1 reprograms glucose metabolism HIF1alpha, sustaining increased cell proliferation.
