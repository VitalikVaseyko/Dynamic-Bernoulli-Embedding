 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) activity decreased acute myelomonoblastic leukaemia (AML) lymphosarcoma cell leukaemia (LSAL) increased patients chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML). difference enzyme activity controls relatives patients AML. PK activity patients complete remission higher untreated relapsed stages. data provided evidence altered enzyme activity acquired rather genetic. positive correlation PK activity red cell creatine levels. red cell creatine low patients AML high patients CML. suggests altered enzyme activity patients least part due red cell age.
