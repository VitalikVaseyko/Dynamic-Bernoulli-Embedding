 Endometriosis prevalent health condition women reproductive age characterized ectopic growth endometrial-like tissue extrauterine environment. Thorough understanding molecular mechanisms underlying disease still incomplete. dissected eutopic ectopic endometrial primary stromal cell proteomes depth nearly 6900 proteins using quantitative mass spectrometry spike-in SILAC standard. Acquired data revealed metabolic reprogramming ectopic stromal cells extensive upregulation glycolysis downregulation oxidative respiration, widespread metabolic phenotype known Warburg effect previously described many cancers. changes metabolism additionally accompanied attenuated aerobic respiration ectopic endometrial stromal cells measured live-cell oximetry altered mRNA levels respective enzyme complexes. results additionally highlight molecular changes ectopic endometriotic stromal cells indicating reduced apoptotic potential, increased cellular invasiveness adhesiveness, altered immune function. Altogether, comprehensive proteomics data refine current understanding endometriosis pathogenesis present new avenues therapies.
