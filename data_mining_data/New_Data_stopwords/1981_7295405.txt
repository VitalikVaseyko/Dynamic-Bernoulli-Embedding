 erythrocyte activities glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase glucose phosphate isomerase decrease first days life. Furthermore level enzymatic activities higher newborn infants higher percentage carboxyhemoglobin. likely premature rapid fall reticulocytes causes decrease enzymatic activities sensitive aging higher hemolysis represent disappearance oldest erythrocytes present lower enzymatic activities. data therefore confirm block erythropoiesis first hours life.
