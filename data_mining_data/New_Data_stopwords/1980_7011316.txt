 Progress curves reaction catalysed pyruvate kinase Escherichia coli K12, designed cover four-dimensional concentration space phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, Mg2+ ATP regulatory region, recorded pH-stat method (pH 7.0 25 degrees C). Additional initial-rate measurement performed assess specific points. Two methods evaluation progress curves used: fitting rate law rates obtained tangents progress curves fitting integrated rate law directly curves. Two models, extensions concerted model given Monod, Wyman & Changeux [(1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88--118] four protomers, could fitted data within experimental error. Model discrimination favour one models possible proper experimental design. selected model one conformational state enzyme forms active complex. active site second conformational state forms abortive complexes Mg2+, causing strong inhibition high Mg2+ concentrations. absence ligands, enzyme third state binds ATP allosteric site.
