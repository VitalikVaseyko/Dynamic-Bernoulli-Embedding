 Mast cells release many inflammatory mediators play important role allergic diseases also chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, others. lot mast cells exist synovium rheumatoid arthritis, known synovitis occur mast cell-deficient mice. Thus, thought mast cells play important role rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. Leflunomide drug used clinically treatment rheumatoid arthritis. used clinical doses 2-cyano-3-hydroxy-N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-butenamide (A77 1726), active metabolite leflunomide, decreased number viable human primary mast cells concentration-dependent manner. decrease reversed uridine. Inhibition pyrimidine synthesis dihydro-orotic acid dehydrogenase inhibition, primary mechanism action A77 1726, involved. A77 1726 dramatically induced apoptosis human mast cells inhibited phosphorylation Akt, important survival signal mast cells, concentration-dependent manner. Caspases 3 9, downstream molecules Akt survival pathway, also fragmented A77 1726. addition, became evident first time mechanism involved result concentration-dependent inhibition PDK1 phosphorylation, controls activation Akt. results indicate new way controlling mast cells may therefore basis innovative approaches treatment various diseases related mast cells.
