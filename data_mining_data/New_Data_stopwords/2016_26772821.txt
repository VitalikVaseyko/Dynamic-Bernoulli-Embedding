 Obesity known poorer prognosis factor breast cancer postmenopausal women. Among diverse endocrine factors associated obesity, leptin received special attention since promotes breast cancer cell growth invasiveness, processes force cells adapt metabolism satisfy increased demands energy biosynthetic intermediates. Taking account, aim explore effects leptin metabolism MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Polarographic analysis revealed leptin increased oxygen consumption rate cellular ATP levels dependent mitochondrial oxidative metabolism leptin-treated cells compared glycolytic control cells. Experiments selective inhibitors glycolysis (2-DG), fatty acid oxidation (etomoxir) aminoacid deprivation showed ATP levels reliant fatty acid oxidation. agreement, levels key proteins involved lipid catabolism (FAT/CD36, CPT1, PPARalpha) phosphorylation energy sensor AMPK increased leptin. Regarding glucose, cellular uptake affected leptin, lactate release deeply repressed. Analysis pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) pyruvate carboxylase (PC) together pentose-phosphate pathway enzyme glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) revealed leptin favors use glucose biosynthesis. results point towards role leptin metabolic reprogramming, consisting enhanced use glucose biosynthesis lipids energy production. metabolic adaptations induced leptin may provide benefits MCF-7 growth give support reverse Warburg effect described breast cancer.
