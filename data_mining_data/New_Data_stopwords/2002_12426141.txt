 Using human rodent cells vitro, characterized hypoxia-inducible signaling pathway one pathways affected carcinogenic nickel compounds. Acute exposure nickel activates hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1), strongly induces hypoxia-inducible genes, including recently discovered tumor marker Cap43. gene cloned based nickel inducibility found highly inducible hypoxia. identify HIF-1-dependent/independent nickel-inducible genes, used cells obtained HIF-1 alpha null mouse embryos analyzed gene expression changes using microarray technique. found genes coding glycolytic enzymes, known regulated HIF-1, also induced nickel-exposed cells. addition, identified number new genes highly induced nickel HIF-dependent manner. Elevated HIF-1 activity acute nickel exposure might selectively advantageous nickel-transformed rodent human cells possess increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Hypoxia plays important role tumor progression. selects cells enhanced glycolytic activity, causing production large amounts lactic acid, one common features tumor cells (Warburg effect). Here, hypothesize exposure nickel activates hypoxia-inducible pathway facilitates selection cells increased transcriptional activity hypoxia-inducible genes, may important nickel-induced carcinogenic process.
