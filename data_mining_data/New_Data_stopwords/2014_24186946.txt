 Approximately 80-90% retinoids body stored retinyl esters (REs) liver. Adipose tissue also contributes significantly storage. present studies, employing genetic nutritional interventions, explored factors responsible regulating accumulation liver adipose tissue influence levels retinoic acid (RA) RA-responsive gene expression. data establish acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) activity involved synthesis liver, even mice nutritionally stressed feeding 25-fold excess retinol diet upon ablation cellular retinol-binding protein type (CRBPI), proposed limit retinol availability ARATs. Unlike liver, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) responsible synthesis, true adipose tissue Lrat-deficient mice display significantly elevated concentrations. However, CrbpI also absent, levels resemble wild-type levels, suggesting role CrbpI accumulation adipose tissue. Although expression several RA-responsive genes elevated Lrat-deficient liver, employing sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry protocol contrary assumed many years, detect elevated concentrations all-trans-RA. elevated RA-responsive gene expression associated elevated hepatic triglyceride levels decreased expression Ppardelta downstream Pdk4 target, suggesting role RA processes vivo.
