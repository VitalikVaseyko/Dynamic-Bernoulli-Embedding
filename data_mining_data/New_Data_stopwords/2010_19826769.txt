 well known free fatty acids (FFAs) play key role implementing insulin resistance type 2 diabetes. Resources chemical compounds intervene derogatory effect FFAs indeed limited. isolated mahanine, carbazole alkaloid, leaves Murraya koenegii prevented palmitate-induced inhibition insulin-stimulated phosphorylation IRbeta, PI3K, PDK1, Akt L6 myotubes. also reflected palmitate-induced inhibition insulin-stimulated [(3)H] 2-DOG uptake L6 myotubes, palmitate adverse effect significantly blocked mahanine. Previous reports indicated one major targets lipid-induced damage insulin signaling pathway resulting impairment insulin sensitivity insulin receptor (IR). Here, observed palmitate significantly increased pPKCepsilon cytosol nuclear region L6 myotubes comparison control. Translocation pPKCepsilon nucleus associated impairment HMGA1, architectural transcription factor IR gene reversed mahanine. Palmitate-induced activation IKK/IkappaBeta/NF-kappaBeta pathway also attenuated mahanine. Taken together, mahanine showed encouraging possibility deal lipid induced insulin resistance. order examine further, mahanine administered nutritionally induced type 2 diabetic golden hamsters; significantly improved hyperglycemia treated animals. results, therefore, suggest mahanine acts two important sites lipid induced insulin resistance (i) impairment IR gene expression (ii) activation NF-kappaBeta pathway, thus, showing promise therapeutic choice type 2 diabetes.
