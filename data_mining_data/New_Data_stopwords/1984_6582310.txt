 activities six different enzymes compared 29 normal, 34 dysplastic, 80 cancerous (both primary metastatic) human breast tissues; MCF-7 cells; primary rat mammary tumors. Benign lesions generally showed enzyme activities similar normal breast tissues. Malignant tumors significantly increased activities lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), creatine kinase. Enzyme activity malignant tumor always higher apparently normal fibrocystic tissue patient. Enzyme activities correlate levels estrogen progesterone receptors. LDH, MDH, HK elevated similar extent tissues examined. Conversely, PK elevated much greater extent cancerous tissues, particularly MCF-7 cells. elevated activities enzymes may diagnostic potential, especially tumor tissue apparently normal tissue patient compared.
