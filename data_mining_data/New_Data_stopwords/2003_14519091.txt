 Type 2 diabetes, glucose homeostasis impaired due either decrease insulin secretion insulin action. symposium, molecular targets could impact either defects discussed data related specific compounds presented. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors relieve negative control insulin action active cell assays, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors raise postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 levels animals humans, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitors increase levels pyruvate dehydrogenase, turn improve insulin sensitivity, discussed. Roche presented first time novel glucokinase activators discussed vitro vivo activity profiles representative glucokinase activators potential therapy Type 2 diabetes. Second generation retinoid X receptor modulators retain desirable effects full agonists, devoid negative attributes, triglyceride accumulation, discussed. Also, clinical efficacy results synthetic exendin-4, Exenatide trade mark, glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue, presented. area obesity, agonists several central (melanocortin type 4, serotonin subtype 2C cannabinoid receptor 1) receptors one peripheral G-protein-coupled receptor, cholecystokinin receptor-A, lead reduced food intake animals, discussed.
