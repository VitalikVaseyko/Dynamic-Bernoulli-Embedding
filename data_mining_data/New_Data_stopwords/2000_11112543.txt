 Aspergillus niger plyA gene encoding pectate lyase (EC 4.2.99. 3) cloned chromosomal lambda(EMBL4) library using Aspergillus nidulans pectate lyase encoding gene [Dean, R. A., Timberlake, W. E. (1989) Plant Cell 1, 275-284] probe. plyA gene overexpressed using promoter fusion A. niger pyruvate kinase promoter. Purification recombinant pectate lyase resulted identification two enzyme forms one appeared N-glycosylated appeared free N-glycosylation. two enzyme forms showed identical specific activities. N-glycosylation free pectate lyase characterized respect product formation polygalacturonic acid (alpha-1,4 linked D-galacturonic acid) mode action oligogalacturonides degree polymerization 2-8. bond cleavage frequencies tetra-, penta-, hexagalacturonides studied function [CaCl(2)]. bond cleavage frequencies changed [CaCl(2)]-dependent way penta- hexagalacturonide. Kinetic studies using tetra- hexagalacturonide revealed strong sigmoidal [CaCl(2)]-dependent relation. role Ca(2+) ions substrate binding discussed.
