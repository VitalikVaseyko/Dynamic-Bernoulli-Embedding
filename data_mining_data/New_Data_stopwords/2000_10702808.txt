 BACKGROUND OBJECTIVE: partial red blood cell (RBC) pyruvate-kinase (PK-R) deficiency found patient concomitant hereditary spherocytosis (HS) chronic hemolytic anemia. Clinical, biological molecular studies performed patient, parents brother, order characterize specific PK-R gene mutation inheritance mechanism transmission red cell defects particular family. DESIGN METHODS: Conventional biological studies used identify PK-LR gene mutation responsible hereditary transmission PK-R deficiency HS. family study completed genotypic RBC membrane protein analyses patient family. RESULTS: Molecular study PK deficiency performed family members demonstrated heterozygous condition 1516 G->A (506Val->Ile) mutation PK-LR gene patient mother. Since mutation reported previously, provisionally named PK "Mallorca". study RBC membrane proteins demonstrated existence partial band 3 protein 4.2 deficiencies propositus father mother brother, also studied. results support dominant mode inheritance HS PK-LR gene family. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSIONS: HS PK deficiency exceptional Spain. co-existence RBC defects patient, however, rare; cases described date. findings suggest performing elementary RBC enzyme survey patients HS would help determine real frequency apparently rare association.
