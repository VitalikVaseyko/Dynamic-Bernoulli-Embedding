 organisms, efficient D-galactose utilization requires highly conserved Leloir pathway converts D-galactose D-glucose 1-phosphate. However, bacterial fungal species alternative routes D-galactose assimilation identified. so-called De Ley-Doudoroff pathway, D-galactose metabolized pyruvate D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate five consecutive reactions carried specific enzymes. penultimate step pathway involves phosphorylation 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate 6-phosphate catalyzed 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate kinase, ATP serving phosphoryl-group donor. Here, crystal structure 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate kinase Klebsiella pneumoniae determined 2.1 resolution reported, first structure enzyme De Ley-Doudoroff pathway. Structural comparison indicates enzyme belongs ASKHA (acetate sugar kinases/hsc70/actin) family phosphotransferases. protein composed two alpha/beta domains, contains core common family members. Additional elements introduced conserved structural motifs define unique features 2-oxo-3-deoxygalactonate kinase possibly determine biological function protein.
