 Metabolic microenvironment tumor cells influenced oncogenic signaling tissue-specific metabolic demands, blood supply, enzyme expression. elucidate tumor-specific metabolism, compared metabolomics normal tumor tissues surgically resected pairwise nine lung seven prostate cancer patients, using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). Phosphorylation levels enzymes involved central carbon metabolism also quantified. Metabolomic profiles lung prostate tissues comprised 114 86 metabolites, respectively, profiles well distinguished tumor normal tissues, also squamous cell carcinoma tumor types lung cancer poorly differentiated tumors moderately differentiated tumors prostate cancer. Concentrations amino acids, especially branched-chain amino acids, significantly higher tumor tissues, independent organ type, essential amino acids particularly higher poorly differentiated moderately differentiated prostate cancers. Organ-dependent differences prominent levels glycolytic tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates associated energy status. Significantly high lactate concentrations elevated activating phosphorylation levels phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase lung tumors confirmed hyperactive glycolysis. highlighted potential CE-TOFMS-based metabolomics combined phosphorylated enzyme analysis understanding tissue-specific tumor microenvironments, may lead development effective specific anticancer therapeutics.
