 origins role Warburg effect remained uncertain many years. Two recent studies demonstrate embryonic- cancer-cell-specific isoform enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) regulated binding phospho-tyrosine motifs promotes increased cell growth tumor development. PKM2 enhances use glycolytic intermediates macromolecular biosynthesis tumor growth. findings illustrate distinct advantages metabolic phenotype cancer cell growth.
