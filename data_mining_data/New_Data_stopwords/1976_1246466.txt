 vivo incorporation radioactivity [U-14C]glucose reduced undernourished rat pups ages 6, 10, 17 days brain lipids, age 10 days brain amino acids. Brain glucose concentrations lower age 20 days (controls 1.58 +/- 0.26 vs. test 1.14 +/- 0.07 mumol/g) alterations brain glucose, glycogen, ATP, phosphocreatine concentrations found. Brain mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase activity 21% 30% lower undernourished animals ages 10 20 days, respectively. Brain mitochondrial supernatant isocitrate dehydrogenase activities pyruvate kinase activity similar undernourished control animals. Brain glycogen levels 2-4 times higher late fetal newborn control animals (13.6 15.3 mumol/g) older animals (4.2-5.7 mumol/g). Brain glucose, ATP, phosphocreatine levels increased 15-day fetus newborn, thereafter showed increase.
