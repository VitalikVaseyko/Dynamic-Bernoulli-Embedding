Characterization defective PK isozymes internationally standardized criteria indicated one (PK-"Gainesville") severely impaired substrate affinity, another (PK-"San Juan") markedly reduced residual activity, third (PK-"Cape Canaveral") combination milder defects. appears representative subsets emerging heterogeneous molecular defects make pyruvate kinase deficiency.
