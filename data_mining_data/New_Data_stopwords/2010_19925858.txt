 Lead intoxication serious occupational disease constitutes major public health problem. Lead, heavy metal, used humans many technological purposes, main reason widespread distribution. toxic mechanisms lead molecular machinery living organisms include metal transport, energy metabolism, diverse enzymatic processes, genetic regulation, membrane ionic channels signaling molecules. Since lead able cross blood-brain barrier may cause neurotoxicity. Creatine kinase pyruvate kinase two thiol-containing enzymes exert key role cellular energy homeostasis brain. main objective investigate vitro effect lead pyruvate kinase creatine kinase activities extracts subcellular fractions brain cortex rats presence thiol-protecting substances glutathione cysteamine. results showed lead inhibited two enzyme activities thiol-protecting substances prevented inhibition. results suggest lead inhibits creatine kinase pyruvate kinase activity interaction thiol groups. Therefore, lead may disrupt energy homeostasis effect may contribute neurological dysfunction found lead exposed individuals.
