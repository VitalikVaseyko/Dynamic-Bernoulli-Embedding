 Prenatal exposure ethanol reported cause developmental defects brain. brain development, sufficient energy source deemed essential glucose regarded primary energy source neurons. study, impact ethanol embryonic malformation cerebral glucose metabolism developing embryo investigated. Different doses ethanol (0, 10, 20, 40 mg/egg) administrated chicken embryos 36 h incubation. Embryonic brain weight found significantly decreased. Moreover, observed obvious reduction neurofilament expression central nervous system (CNS) immunostaining assay. indicated ethanol exposure caused obvious CNS damages resulted malformations developing brain. Mechanism research showed cerebral glucose lactic acid contents, activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase lactic dehydrogenase decreased dose dependently. Meanwhile, mRNA levels glucose transporter 1, glucose transporter 3 insulin-like growth factor brain demonstrated significant decrease gene expression ethanol exposure. results suggested glucose metabolism disorder important risk factor ethanol exposure induced malformation embryonic brain.
