 Despite decades effort, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains intractable clinical challenge. insufficient understanding mechanisms underlying tumor cell responses chemotherapy contributes significantly lack effective treatment regimens. Here, paclitaxel, first-line chemotherapeutic agent, observed interact synergistically birinapant, Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator Caspases mimetic. Therefore, investigated molecular-level drug interaction mechanisms using comprehensive, reproducible, well-controlled ion-current-based MS1 quantification (IonStar). analyzing 40 biological samples single batch, compared temporal proteomic responses PDAC cells treated birinapant paclitaxel, alone combined. Using stringent criteria (e.g. strict false-discovery-rate FDR control, 2 peptides/protein), quantified 4069 unique proteins confidently (99.8% without missing data), 541 proteins significantly altered three treatment groups, FDR <1%. Interestingly, proteins altered combined birinapant/paclitaxel, predominantly represented three biological processes: mitochondrial function, cell growth apoptosis, cell cycle arrest. Proteins responsible activation oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid beta-oxidation, inactivation aerobic glycolysis altered largely combined birinapant/paclitaxel compared single drugs, suggesting Warburg effect, critical survival proliferation cancer cells, alleviated combination treatment. Metabolic profiling performed confirm substantially greater suppression Warburg effect combined agents compared either drug alone. Immunoassays confirmed proteomic data revealing changes apoptosis/survival signaling pathways, inhibition PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK signal transduction, well induction G2/M arrest, showed drug combination induced much apoptosis single agents. Overall, in-depth, large-scale proteomics study provided novel insights molecular mechanisms underlying synergy combined birinapant/paclitaxel, describes proteomics/informatics pipeline applied broadly development cancer drug combination regimens.
