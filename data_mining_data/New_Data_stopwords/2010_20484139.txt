 OBJECTIVE: Insulin-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling interleukin-6 (IL-6)-instigated JAK/STAT3-signaling pathways liver inhibit expression gluconeogenic genes decrease hepatic glucose output. insulin receptor (IR) JAK1 tyrosine kinases STAT3 serve direct substrates T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP). Homozygous TCPTP-deficiency results perinatal lethality prohibiting informative assessment TCPTP's role glucose homeostasis. used Ptpn2+/- mice investigate TCPTP's function glucose homeostasis. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: analyzed insulin sensitivity gluconeogenesis chow versus high-fat-fed (HFF) Ptpn2+/- Ptpn2+/+ mice insulin IL-6 signaling gluconeogenic gene expression Ptpn2+/- Ptpn2+/+ hepatocytes. RESULTS: HFF Ptpn2+/- mice exhibited lower fasted blood glucose decreased hepatic glucose output determined hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps decreased blood glucose levels pyruvate tolerance tests. reduced hepatic glucose output coincided decreased expression gluconeogenic genes G6pc Pck1 enhanced hepatic STAT3 phosphorylation PI3K/Akt signaling fasted state. Insulin-induced IR-beta-subunit Y1162/Y1163 phosphorylation PI3K/Akt signaling IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation also enhanced isolated Ptpn2+/- hepatocytes. increased insulin IL-6 signaling resulted enhanced suppression G6pc Pck1 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Liver TCPTP antagonises insulin STAT3 signaling pathways regulate gluconeogenic gene expression hepatic glucose output.
