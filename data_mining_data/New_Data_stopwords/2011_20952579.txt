 Acetyl phosphate (AcP) small-molecule metabolite act phosphoryl group donor response regulators two-component systems (TCSs). serious human respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) synthesizes AcP conventional pathway involving phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase, encoded pta ackA, respectively. addition, pneumococcus synthesizes copious amounts AcP hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) pyruvate oxidase, encoded spxB. assess possible roles AcP pneumococcal TCS regulation metabolism, constructed strains combinations spxB, pta, ackA mutations determined effects ATP, AcP, H(2)O(2) production. Unexpectedly, DeltaackA mutants unstable readily accumulated primary suppressor mutations spxB positive regulator, spxR, thereby reducing H(2)O(2) AcP levels, secondary capsule mutations cps2E cps2C. DeltaackA DeltaspxB mutants contained half cellular amount ATP DeltaspxB spxB(+) strain. Acetate addition anaerobic growth experiments suggested decreased ATP, rather increased AcP, reason DeltaackA mutants accumulated spxB spxR suppressors, although experimental manipulation AcP amount limited. finding considerations suggest coping endogenously produced H(2)O(2) may require energy. Starting DeltaspxB mutant, constructed Deltapta, DeltaackA, Deltapta DeltaackA mutants. Epistasis microarray experiment results consistent role SpxB-Pta-AckA pathway expression regulons controlled WalRK(Spn), CiaRH(Spn), LiaSR(Spn) TCSs involved sensing cell wall status. However, AcP likely play physiological role TCS sensing S. pneumoniae.
