 Mutations genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha HNF4alpha cause monogenic form diabetes mellitus known maturity-onset diabetes young (MODY). primary cause MODY impairment glucose-stimulated insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells, indicating important roles HNF1alpha HNF4alpha beta-cells. Large-scale genetic studies clarified common variants HNF1alpha HNF4alpha genes also associated type 2 diabetes, suggesting involved pathogenesis diseases. Recent experimental studies revealed HNF1alpha controls beta-cell function growth regulating target genes glucose transporter 2, pyruvate kinase, collectrin, hepatocyte growth factor activator, HNF4alpha. contrast, HNF4alpha mainly regulates function beta-cells. Although direct target genes HNF4alpha beta-cells largely unknown, recently identified Anks4b novel target HNF4alpha regulates beta-cell susceptibility endoplasmic reticulum stress. Studies MODY led better understanding molecular mechanism glucose-stimulated insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells.
