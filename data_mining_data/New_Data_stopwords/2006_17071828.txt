 eukaryotes carry glycolysis, interestingly, using enzymes. Anaerobic eukaryotes face challenge fewer molecules ATP extracted per molecule glucose due lack complete tricarboxylic acid cycle. may pressured anaerobic eukaryotes acquire ATP-efficient alternative glycolytic enzymes, pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, lateral gene transfers bacteria eukaryotes. studies enzymes eukaryotes involve pathogenic anaerobes; Monocercomonoides, oxymonad belonging eukaryotic supergroup Excavata, nonpathogenic anaerobe representing evolutionarily ecologically distinct sampling anaerobic glycolytic pathway. sequenced cDNA encoding glycolytic enzymes previously established cDNA library Monocercomonoides analyzed relationships enzymes organisms spanning major groups Eukaryota, Bacteria, Archaea. established that, firstly, Monocercomonoides possesses alternative versions glycolytic enzymes: fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase, pyruvate kinase pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (class II, type B). Secondly, found evidence monophyly oxymonads, kinetoplastids, diplomonads, parabasalids, major representatives Excavata. also found several prokaryote-to-eukaryote well eukaryote-to-eukaryote lateral gene transfers involving glycolytic enzymes anaerobic eukaryotes, suggesting lateral gene transfer important factor evolution pathway denizens environment.
