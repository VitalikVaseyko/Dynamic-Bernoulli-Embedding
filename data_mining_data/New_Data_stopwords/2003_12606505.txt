 short-term fasting, substrate utilization skeletal muscle shifts predominantly carbohydrate fat means conserving glucose. examine potential influence short-term fasting refeeding transcriptional regulation skeletal muscle, muscle biopsies obtained nine male subjects rest, 20 h fasting, 1 h consuming either high-carbohydrate (CHO trial) low-carbohydrate (FAT trial) meal. Fasting induced increase transcription pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) (10-fold), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) ( approximately 2-fold), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) ( approximately 5-fold), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I) ( approximately 2.5-fold) genes. Surprisingly, transcription PDK4 LPL increased response refeeding (both trials) 50-fold 6- 10-fold, respectively, prefasting levels. However, responses varied among subjects two subjects particular displaying far greater activation PDK4 (>100-fold) LPL (>20-fold) subjects (mean approximately 8-fold approximately 2-fold, respectively). Transcription UCP3 decreased basal levels CHO meal remained elevated FAT meal, whereas CPT remained elevated refeeding meals. present findings demonstrate short-term fasting/refeeding humans alters transcription several genes skeletal muscle related lipid metabolism. Marked heterogeneity transcriptional response fasting/refeeding protocol suggests individual differences genetic profile may play important role adaptive molecular responses metabolic challenges.
