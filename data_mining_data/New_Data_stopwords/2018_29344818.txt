 11-week feeding trial carried investigate effects supplemented chromium picolinate (Cr-Pic) growth, whole-body composition, relative mRNA expression related lipogenesis glucose metabolism juvenile blunt snout bream. Seven isonitrogenous isoenergetic diets graded Cr supplementation levels fed triplicate groups. final weight (FW), feed conversion ratio (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR) improved increasing dietary Cr supplementation levels 0.4 mg/kg, thereafter showed relatively constant. However, 12.0 mg/kg dietary Cr supplementation decreased growth feed utilization. Based SGR FCR, optimal dietary Cr supplementation level juvenile estimated 0.28 mg/kg. Significantly higher plasma insulin levels found juvenile fed diets 0.4 0.8 mg/kg Cr supplementation compared fed diet sans supplemented Cr. Plasma glucose levels decreased increasing dietary Cr supplementation, lowest value remarked group added 3.2 mg/kg Cr. Adding 0.4-0.8 mg/kg Cr enhanced insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), pyruvate kinase (PK) inhibited expression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), glycogen synthase (GS) mRNA levels. High dietary Cr (12.0 mg/kg) supplementation resulted high G6Pase PEPCK expression. highest content whole-body lipid remarked fish fed 0.4 mg/kg dietary Cr, related enhanced gene expression related lipogenesis; thereafter, mRNA levels showed diminishing trend. findings indicate optimum dietary Cr-Pic supplementation positive effect growth blood glucose homeostasis modifying mRNA levels related glucose metabolism lipogenesis juvenile blunt snout bream.
