 substrate specificity rat liver phosphoprotein phosphatases investigated. enzymes resolved three fractions, termed A, B C, elution DEAE-cellulose apparent molecular weights, determined Sephadex G-200 chromatography, approximately 250 000, 250 000 140 000, respectively. fractions catalyzed dephosphorylation calf-thymus phosphohistones, salmon phosphoprotamine rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase a. major portion activity towards substrates found fraction B. activity towards rat liver phosphopyruvate kinase (type L) resided almost exclusively fractions B C. concluded rat liver contains multiple forms phosphoprotein phosphatases phosphatases fraction B C major activities towards phosphopyruvate kinase.
