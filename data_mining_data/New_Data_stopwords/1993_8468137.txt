 Flexibility metabolism Hymenolepis diminuta associated changing intrinsic requirements maturation also influenced extrinsic factors, is, nature host environment. End-products carbohydrate metabolism enzyme activities worm extracts used indicators metabolic regulation H. diminuta recovered various times postinfection. predominant end-product 6-day-old worms lactate, generated cytosolic glycolysis. cestode matures host, lactate production whole worm decreases greater amounts mitochondrial end-products, succinate acetate, detected. stable, dichotomous carbon flow lactate, succinate acetate observed 12 days post-infection. metabolic gradient along length individual strobila also evident. extends glycolysis, anterior region, mitochondrial dismutation posterior region. transition cytosolic mitochondrial pathways maturation along strobilus delayed suppressed worms recovered immunosensitized hosts. Four host environments compared: unsensitized rats, rats immunosensitized primary infection H. diminuta, rats immunosensitized primary infection Nippostrongylus brasiliensis mice concurrently infected Heligmosomoides polygyrus. specific activities PK PEPCK whole worm extracts similar 10-, 21- 35-day-old worms differ worms isolated different host environments. However, PEPCK/PK ratio high worms utilize mitochondrial pathways low worms produce predominantly lactate. LDH activity high lactate producers. concluded pattern metabolism H. diminuta influenced many effectors host environment.
