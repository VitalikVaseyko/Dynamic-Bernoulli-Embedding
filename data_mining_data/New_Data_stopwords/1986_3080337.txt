 Four overlapping cDNA clones L-type pyruvate kinase (PK-L) isolated carbohydrate-induced rat liver cDNA libraries. contained coding sequence enzyme 7th codon entire 3'-untranslated extension poly(A) tail. sequence first 7 codons 5'-untranslated region determined primer extension. analyzed PK-L mRNA 19 5'-untranslated bases, 1629 coding bases 1281 3'-untranslated bases without poly(A) tail; corresponds heavier, 3.2 kb species L-type mRNAs. codons phosphorylatable site located 5'-end messenger. unusually long 3'-untranslated extension contains repetitive element complementary 'brain-specific' identifier sequence described Sutcliffe et al.
