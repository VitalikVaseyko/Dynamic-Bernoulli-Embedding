 Previous work shown GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), aldolase, PFK (phosphofructokinase), PK (pyruvate kinase) LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) assemble GE (glycolytic enzyme) complex inner surface human erythrocyte membrane. effort define molecular architecture complex, undertaken localize binding sites enzymes accurately. report that: (i) major aldolase-binding site erythrocyte membrane located within N-terminal residues 1-23 band 3 consensus sequences D6DYED10 E19EYED23 necessary form single enzyme-binding site; (ii) GAPDH two tandem binding sites band 3, located residues 1-11 residues 12-23 respectively; (iii) PFK-binding site resides residues 12 23 band 3; (iv) GEs bind third consensus sequence (residues D902EYDE906) C-terminus band 3; (v) LDH- PK-binding sites erythrocyte membrane reside band 3. Taken together, results argue band 3 provides nucleation site GE complex human erythrocyte membrane components near band 3 must also participate organizing enzyme complex.
