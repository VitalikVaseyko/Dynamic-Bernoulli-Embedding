 BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) characterized abnormal growth enhanced glycolysis pulmonary artery endothelial cells. However, mechanisms underlying alterations energy production identified. METHODS: Here, examined miRNA proteomic profiles blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) patients heritable PAH caused mutations bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) gene patients idiopathic PAH determine mechanisms underlying abnormal endothelial glycolysis. hypothesized BOECs patients PAH, downregulation microRNA-124 (miR-124), determined tiered systems biology approach, responsible increased expression splicing factor PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), resulting alternative splicing pyruvate kinase muscle isoforms 1 2 (PKM1 2) consequently increased PKM2 expression. questioned whether alternative regulation plays critical role hyperglycolytic phenotype PAH endothelial cells. RESULTS: Heritable PAH idiopathic PAH BOECs recapitulated metabolic abnormalities observed pulmonary artery endothelial cells patients idiopathic PAH, confirming switch oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis. Overexpression miR-124 siRNA silencing PTPB1 restored normal proliferation glycolysis heritable PAH BOECs, corrected dysregulation glycolytic genes lactate production, partially restored mitochondrial respiration. BMPR2 knockdown control BOECs reduced expression miR-124, increased PTPB1, enhanced glycolysis. Moreover, observed reduced miR-124, increased PTPB1 PKM2 expression, significant dysregulation glycolytic genes rat SUGEN-hypoxia model severe PAH, characterized reduced BMPR2 expression endothelial hyperproliferation, supporting relevance mechanism vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary vascular circulating progenitor endothelial cells isolated patients PAH demonstrate downregulation miR-124, leading metabolic proliferative abnormalities PAH ECs via PTPB1 PKM1/PKM2. Therefore, manipulation miRNA targets could represent novel therapeutic approach treatment PAH.
