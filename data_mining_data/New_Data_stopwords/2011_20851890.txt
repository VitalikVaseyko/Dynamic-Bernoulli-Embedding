 Resveratrol (RSV) naturally occurring polyphenol found exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective properties. However, RSV exerts beneficial health effects remains largely unknown. Here, show RSV inhibits insulin- leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling C2C12 fibroblasts via Sirt1-independent mechanism. Treating C2C12 cells RSV dramatically inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt, S6 kinase, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation little effect tyrosine phosphorylation insulin receptor activation p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway. RSV treatment also partially blocked mTOR S6 kinase phosphorylation TSC1/2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting presence inhibitory site downstream TSC1/2. Knocking PDK1 suppressing AMP-activated protein kinase little effect leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling. hand, RSV significantly increased association mTOR inhibitor, DEPTOR. Furthermore, inhibitory effect RSV leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling greatly reduced cells expression levels DEPTOR suppressed RNAi. Taken together, studies reveal RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTORC1 activation promoting mTOR/DEPTOR interaction thus uncover novel mechanism RSV negatively regulates mTOR activity.
