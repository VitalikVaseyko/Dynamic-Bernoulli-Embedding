 influence thyroxine treatment key enzymes involved glycolytic HMP shunt pathways studied caput, corpus cauda epididymides pubertal rats, related serum hormone profile. activity 6-phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase significantly increased 3 segments epididymis, HMP shunt pathway suppressed. Thyroxine treatment found depress serum levels testosterone, LH FSH, although increase prolactin levels observed. Withdrawal hormone treatment resulted restoration normal activity 6-phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase restoration normal serum hormone levels. However, activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase increased following withdrawal treatment. concluded hyperthyroidism exerts influence epididymal enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism.
