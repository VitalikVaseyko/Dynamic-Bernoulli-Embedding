 BACKGROUND: Deregulated energetics property cancer cells. phenomenon, known Warburg Effect aerobic glycolysis, characterized increased glucose uptake, lactate export extracellular acidification, even presence oxygen. beta-alanine non-essential amino acid previously shown metabolized carnosine, functions intracellular buffer. buffering capacity, investigated effects beta-alanine metabolic cancerous phenotype. METHODS: Non-malignant MCF-10a malignant MCF-7 breast epithelial cells treated beta-alanine 100 mM 24 hours. Aerobic glycolysis quantified measuring extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) oxidative metabolism quantified measuring oxygen consumption rate (OCR). mRNA metabolism-related genes quantified qRT-PCR corresponding protein expression quantified immunoblotting, flow cytometry verified confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial content quantified using mitochondria-specific dye measured flow cytometry. RESULTS: Cells treated beta-alanine displayed significantly suppressed basal peak ECAR (aerobic glycolysis), simultaneous increase glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Additionally, cells treated beta-alanine exhibited significantly reduced basal peak OCR (oxidative metabolism), accompanied reduction mitochondrial content subsequent suppression genes promote mitochondrial biosynthesis. Suppression glycolytic oxidative metabolism beta-alanine resulted reduction total metabolic rate, although cell viability affected. beta-alanine treatment reduces extracellular acidity, constituent invasive microenvironment promotes progression, investigated effect beta-alanine breast cell viability migration. beta-alanine shown reduce cell migration proliferation without acting cytotoxic fashion. Moreover, beta-alanine significantly increased malignant cell sensitivity doxorubicin, suggesting potential role co-therapeutic agent. CONCLUSION: Taken together, results suggest beta-alanine may elicit several anti-tumor effects. observations support need investigation mechanism(s) action specificity beta-alanine co-therapeutic agent treatment breast tumors.
