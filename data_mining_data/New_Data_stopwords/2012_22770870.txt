 Cancer cells greater need energy ready supply building blocks necessary synthesis macromolecules (nucleotides, protein, lipids) order duplicate genome biomass. hypothesis postulated precursors synthetic processes, furnished glycolysis, cannot sufficiently recruited external sources (the blood stream) glycolysis necessarily markedly activated. also hypothesized Krebs cycle, also furnishes precursors macromolecule synthesis meet requirements proliferating cells, depleted intermediates. view cyclic nature requiring pyruvate also oxalacetate "last" metabolite reaction sequence sustenance, Krebs cycle may partially inactivated. anaplerotic reactions sources (amino acids fatty acids) could supply cycle intermediates, pathways constitute futile cycles amino fatty acids would partially degraded cycle intermediates thus obtained would exported cytoplasm synthetic processes advantage cell. also hypothesized glutamine, important fuel cancer cells playing critical role anaplerosis, may contribute reinforce cycle; malate alpha-ketoglutarate, two products glutamine metabolism, might exported mitochondria precursors biosynthetic pathways. possible malate, used NADPH production required biosynthetic pathways, glycerol-phosphate, used biosynthetic purposes (lipid biosynthesis), unable sustain mitochondrial redox shuttles reducing respiratory capacity mitochondria. Low shuttle capacity implies NADH generated glycolysis needs continuously re-oxidized cytoplasm via lactate dehydrogenase maintain glycolysis fully activated, causing abnormal lactate production observed cancer. paper goes onto discuss essential role glucose cancer cell proliferation also inducing Crabtree effect. finally hypothesized respiration inhibition cancer cells supplied glucose due reactivation suited medium biosynthetic pathways consequences described above.
