 Cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) remains major barrier human multiple myeloma (MM) therapy. present study, aimed investigating role pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) MM CAM-DR. determined PKM2 expression positively correlated cell proliferation knockdown PKM2 contributed increased cell adhesion rate MM. enhancement adhesion MM cells fibronectin bone marrow stroma cell line HS-5 cells translated increased CAM-DR phenotype. Importantly, showed CAM-DR phenotype correlated phosphorylation Akt ERK MM cells. Taken together, data shed new light molecular mechanism CAM-DR MM, targeting PKM2 may novel therapeutic approach improving effectiveness chemotherapy MM.
