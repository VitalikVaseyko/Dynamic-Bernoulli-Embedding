 Protein kinase C (PKC) agonists including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induce redistribution cytosolic PKC various subcellular compartments also activate kinase domain protein. present study investigated nature mitochondrial PKC pool effects mitochondrial function cells treated PMA. Treatment C2C12 myoblasts, C6 glioma COS7 cells PMA resulted dramatic redistribution intracellular PKCalpha pool, large fraction protein pool sequestered mitochondrial compartment. also observed mitochondrial PKCdelta accumulation cell restricted manner. intramitochondrial localization ascertained using combination protection protease treatment isolated mitochondria immunofluorescence microscopy. PMA-induced mitochondrial localization PKCalpha accompanied increased mitochondrial PKC activity, altered cell morphology, disruption mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased complex pyruvate dehydrogenase activities, increased mitochondrial ROS production. changes could retarded treatment PKC inhibitors. results show direct role PMA-mediated PKCalpha translocation mitochondria inducing mitochondrial toxicity.
