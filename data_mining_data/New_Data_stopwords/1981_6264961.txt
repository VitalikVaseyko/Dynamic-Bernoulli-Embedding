 investigated effects exogenous cyclic GMP stimulants endogenous cyclic GMP accumulation L-form (hepatic) pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) activity isolated rat hepatocytes. Exogenous cyclic GMP (200 muM) reduced pyruvate kinase activity, less potent exogenous cyclic AMP (50 muM) (Ki congruent 120 muM vs. 30 muM, respectively), slower onset action (1.0 vs. 0.3 min, respectively) less rapid maximal effect (5.0 vs. 1.0 min, respectively). Similar results noted dibutyryl cyclic GMP dibutyryl cyclic AMP. 1.0 muM acetylcholine increased cyclic GMP concentrations isolated hepatocytes 233 +/- 16 447 +/- 3 pmol/g cell protein (P less 0.001), alter pyruvate kinase activity. Similar results noted carbamylcholine, NaN3 acetylcholine plus eserine sulfate. results suggest differential effect exogenous vs. endogenous cyclic GMP L-form pyruvate kinase activity, question physiological relevance observations exogenous cyclic GMP system.
