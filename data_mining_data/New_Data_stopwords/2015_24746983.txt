 hypothesized analysis mRNA level activity key enzymes amino acid carbohydrate metabolism feeding/fasting/refeeding setting could improve understanding carnivorous fish, like European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), responds changes dietary intake hepatic level. end cDNA fragments encoding genes cytosolic mitochondrial alanine aminotransferase (cALT; mALT), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) cloned sequenced. Measurement mRNA levels quantitative real-time PCR performed livers fasted seabass revealed significant increase cALT (8.5-fold induction) promoting drastic 45-fold down-regulation PK relation levels found fed seabass. observations corroborated enzyme activity meaning food deprivation increase capacity pyruvate generation happened via alanine offset reduction pyruvate derived via glycolysis. 3-day refeeding period cALT returned control levels PK able rebound. alterations detected expression levels G6PDH 6PGDH revealed sensitive specially fasting, confirmed significant 5.7-fold decrease mRNA levels recovery refeeding. results indicate early stages refeeding, liver prioritized restoration systemic normoglycemia replenishment hepatic glycogen. later stage, regular feeding re-established, dietary fuel may channeled glycolysis de novo lipogenesis.
