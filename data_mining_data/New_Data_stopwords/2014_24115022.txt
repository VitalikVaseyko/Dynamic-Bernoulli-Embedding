 Inflammatory immune cells, activated, display much metabolic profile glycolytic tumor cell. involves shift metabolism away oxidative phosphorylation towards aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known Warburg effect. result change macrophages rapidly provide ATP metabolic intermediates biosynthesis immune inflammatory proteins. addition, rise certain tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates occurs notably citrate lipid biosynthesis, succinate, activates transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible factor. review take look emerging evidence role Warburg effect immune inflammatory responses. reprogramming metabolic pathways macrophages, dendritic cells, cells could relevance pathogenesis inflammatory metabolic diseases might provide novel therapeutic strategies.
