 dynamics fructose 6-phosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate cycle operating open homogeneous system reconstituted purified enzymes extensively studied. addition 6-phosphofructokinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinae glucose-6-phosphate isomerase involved. multi-enzyme system, main source non-linearity reciprocal effect AMP activities 6-phosphofructokinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Depending upon experimental parameter values, stable attractors, various types multiple states sustained oscillations shown occur. present report show irreversible transitions also likely occur realistic operating conditions. Two parameters system, adenylate energy charge influx fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase maximal activity, potential candidates provoke irreversible transitions one steady state other: (a) varying maximal activity fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, system jump irreversibly low high stable steady state, (b) adenylate energy charge influx changing parameter, irreversible transitions occur high stable steady state stable oscillatory state (limit cycle motion). behavior predicted constructing loci limit points Hopf bifurcation points.
