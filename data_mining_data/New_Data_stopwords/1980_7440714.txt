 Monoclonal antibodies prepared pyruvate kinase (PyKi; ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) used quantitate PyKi content L2 lung cells WI-38 fibroblasts cultivated hypoxic normoxic conditions. 96 h hypoxic cultivation, PyKi activity significantly increased cell types (L2: normoxia [Po2 = 142 torr], 0.11 +/- 0.01 [SD]; hypoxia [Po2 = 14 torr], 0.25 +/- 0.04 U/microgram DNA, P < 0.01). PyKi content increased proportionately cell lines (L2: normoxia, 0.44 +/- 0.13; hypoxia, 0.94 +/- 0.13 microgram enzyme protein/microgram DNA). Specific activity significantly different 96 h (L2: normoxia, 261 +/- 11; hypoxia, 261 +/- 14 U/mg enzyme protein). results indicate regulation glycolysis chronic hypoxia occurs level enzyme content. Chronic O2 depletion leads either increased rate biosynthesis decreased rate biodegradation PyKi, causing augmented glycolytic capacity. Monoclonal antibodies provide highly specific, convenient approach charcterizing enzymes, well quantitating cellular enzyme content.
