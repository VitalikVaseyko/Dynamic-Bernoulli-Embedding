 present study, synthesized eight new compounds containing 2-amino-cycloalkyl[b]thiophene acridine moieties (ACT01 ACS01 -ACS07 ). None tested compounds presented human erythrocyte cytotoxicity. new compounds presented antipromastigote activity, ACS01 ACS02 derivatives presented significant antileishmanial activity, better performance reference drugs (tri pentavalent antimonials), respective IC50 values 9.60+/-3.19 10.95+/-3.96 muM. Additionally, two derivatives effective antimony-resistant L. (L.) amazonensis strains. addition, binding fragmentation DNA assays performed. observed antileishmanial activity ACS01 associated DNA fragmentation promastigote forms. However, interacted DNA binding constant 10(4) M(-1) . partial least-squares (PLS) studies, observed active compounds (ACS01 ACS02 ) showed lower values amphiphilic moment descriptor, correlation lipophilicity molecules antileishmanial activity. Furthermore, docking molecular studies showed interactions thiophene-acridine derivatives active site pyruvate kinase enzyme major contribution asparagine 152 residue interaction thiophene moiety. Thus, results suggested new thiophene-acridine derivatives promising molecules potential drug candidates. article protected copyright. rights reserved.
