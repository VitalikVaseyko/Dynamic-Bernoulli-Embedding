 initiated analysis protein kinase (PKA) Drosophila using transgenic techniques modulate PKA activity specific tissues development. constructed GAL4/UAS-regulated transgenes active mutant forms encode PKAc, catalytic subunit PKA, PKI(1-31), competitive inhibitor PKAc. present evidence wild-type transgenes active summarize phenotypes produced number GAL4 enhancer-detector strains. compare effects transgenes encoding PKI(1-31) encoding PKAr*, mutant regulatory subunit constitutively inhibits PKAc inability bind cyclic AMP. inhibitors block larval growth, PKAr* alters pattern formation activating Hedgehog signaling pathway. Therefore, transgenic PKI(1-31) provide tool investigate role PKAc larval growth regulation without concomitant changes pattern formation. different effects PKI(1-31) PKAr* suggest two distinct roles, cytoplasmic nuclear, PKAc Hedgehog signal transduction. Alternatively, PKAr* may target proteins PKAc, suggesting role free PKAr signal transduction, role inhibited PKAc reversal classical relationship subunits.
