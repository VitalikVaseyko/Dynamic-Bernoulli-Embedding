 UNLABELLED: Aerobic glycolysis lactate production brain plays key role memory, yet role metabolism cognitive decline associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains poorly understood. examined relationship cerebral lactate levels memory performance APP/PS1 mouse model AD, progressively accumulates amyloid-beta. vivo (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed age-dependent decline lactate levels within frontal cortex control mice, whereas lactate levels remained unaltered APP/PS1 mice 3 12 months age. Analysis hippocampal interstitial fluid vivo microdialysis revealed significant elevation lactate levels APP/PS1 mice relative control mice 12 months age. age-dependent decline levels key aerobic glycolysis enzymes concomitant increase lactate transporter expression detected control mice. Increased expression lactate-producing enzymes correlated improved memory control mice. Interestingly, APP/PS1 mice opposite effect detected. mice, increased expression lactate producing enzymes correlated poorer memory performance. Immunofluorescent staining revealed localization aerobic glycolysis enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase lactate dehydrogenase within cortical hippocampal neurons control mice, well within astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques APP/PS1 mice. observations collectively indicate production lactate, via aerobic glycolysis, beneficial memory function normal aging. However, elevated lactate levels APP/PS1 mice indicate perturbed lactate processing, factor may contribute cognitive decline AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Lactate recently emerged key metabolite necessary memory consolidation. Lactate end product aerobic glycolysis, unique form metabolism occurs within certain regions brain. detected age-dependent decline expression aerobic glycolysis enzymes concomitant decrease lactate levels within frontal cortex wild-type mice. Improved memory performance wild-type mice correlated elevated expression aerobic glycolysis enzymes. Surprisingly, lactate levels remained elevated age increased aerobic glycolysis enzyme expression correlated poorer memory performance APP/PS1 mice. findings suggest lactate production beneficial memory healthy aging brain, might detrimental Alzheimer's disease context.
