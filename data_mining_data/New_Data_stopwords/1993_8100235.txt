 Targeted oncogenesis allowed us obtain two cell lines derived proximal tubule kidney transgenic mice harbouring simian virus (SV40) large small antigens placed control 5' regulatory sequence rat L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene. cell lines (PKSV-PCT PKSV-PR cells) derived early (PCT) late (Pars Recta, PR) microdissected proximal tubules grown D-glucose-enriched medium. conditions culture, cell lines exhibited L-PK transcripts, stable expression SV40-encoded nuclear large antigen, prolonged life span failed induce tumors injected sub-cutaneously athymic (nu-nu) mice. Confluent cells, grown plastic support porous filters, organized monolayers polarized cuboid cells well developed apical microvilli formed domes. cell lines exhibited morphological features proximal tubule cells villin located apical brush-border substantial amounts hydrolase activity. immunofluorescence studies using specific antibodies, aminopeptidase N appeared restricted apical microvillar domain, whereas H2 histocompatibility antigen distributed cytoplasm lateral membranes. results demonstrate proximal morphological phenotype fully preserved cultured cells derived tissue-specific targeted oncogenesis transgenic mice.
