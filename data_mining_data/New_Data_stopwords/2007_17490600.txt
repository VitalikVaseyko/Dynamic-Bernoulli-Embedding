 developed highly sensitive assay MEK-mediated ATP hydrolysis coupling formation ADP NADH oxidation enzymes pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. Robust ATP hydrolysis catalyzed phosphorylated MEK absence protein substrate ERK. ERK-uncoupled ATPase activity dependent phosphorylation status MEK abrogated selective MEK kinase inhibitor U0126. ADP production concomitant Raf-mediated phosphorylation MEK. Based finding, coupled Raf/MEK assay developed measuring Raf activity. kinetic treatment derived steady-state assumptions presented analysis reaction progress curve generated coupled assay. shown inhibitory potency selective Raf inhibitors determined accurately assay.
