 Adhesion intestinal mucosa crucial property probiotic bacteria. Adhesion thought increase host-bacterial interactions, thus potentially enabling health benefits host. Molecular events connected adhesion surface proteome changes investigated probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM cultured established emerging prebiotic carbohydrates carbon source presence mucin, glycoprotein epithelial mucus layer. Variation adhesion HT29-cells mucin associated carbon source mucin-induced subproteome abundancy differences. Specifically, growth fructooligosaccharides (FOS) stimulated adhesion intestinal HT-29 cells, cellobiose polydextrose addition increased adhesion mucin. Adhesion HT-29 cells increased 2-fold bacteria grown mucin-supplemented glucose. Comparative 2DE-MS surface proteome analysis showed different proteins energy metabolism appearing surface, suggesting exert moonlighting functions. Mucin-supplemented bacteria relative abundance pyruvate kinase fructose-bisphosphate aldolase increased 2-fold six spots 3.2-2.1 fold reduced relative abundance comprised elongation factor G, phosphoglycerate kinase, BipAEFTU family GTP-binding protein, ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase, adenylosuccinate synthetase, 30S ribosomal protein S1, manganese-dependent inorganic pyrophosphatase. Surface proteome cellobiose- compared glucose-grown L. acidophilus NCFM phosphate starvation inducible protein stress-related, thermostable pullulanase, elongation factor G increasing 4.4-2.4 fold, GAPDH, elongation factor Ts, pyruvate kinase reduced 2.0-1.5 fold relative abundance. Addition recombinant L. acidophilus NCFM elongation factor G pyruvate kinase coated mucin layer significantly suppressed subsequent adhesion bacterium. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Human diet important intestinal health food components, especially non-digestible carbohydrates beneficially modify microbiota. present study, effects emerging established prebiotic carbohydrates probiotic potential Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM investigated testing adhesion mucin layer intestinal cells, comparing changes abundancy surface proteins thought important host interactions. Increased adhesion observed following culturing bacterium fructooligosaccharides, cellobiose polydextrose, well mucin-supplemented glucose carbon source. Enhanced adhesion ability prolong bacterial residence GIT yielding positive health effects. Higher relative abundance certain surface proteins various conditions (i.e. grown cellobiose mucin-supplemented glucose) suggested involvement proteins adhesion, confirmed competition case two recombinantly produced moonlighting proteins. Combination Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM different carbohydrates revealed potential bacterial determinants synbiotic interactions, including stimulation adhesion.
