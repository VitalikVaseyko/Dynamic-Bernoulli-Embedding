 measurement faecal tumour M2 pyruvate kinase (tumour M2 PK) proposed novel approach early detection colorectal cancer (CRC). However, regards potential test detect precursors CRC, issue highly relevant estimate use reducing CRC incidence mortality, available evidence scant controversial. aim study determine performance characteristics tumour M2 PK test respect colorectal adenomas target population screening. Among 1082 participants screening colonoscopy Germany, 30% adenoma 10% advanced adenoma, median (interquartile range) tumour M2 PK level whole study population 1.3 U ml(-1) (0.3-3.3). cutoff value 4 U ml(-1), sensitivity 22 23% detection advanced adenomas, respectively, whereas specificity 82%. area receiver-operating characteristics curve (95% confidence interval) 0.54 (0.51-0.58) 0.56 (0.52-0.59) advanced adenomas, respectively. conclusion, tumour M2 PK test limited potential distinguish people bearing precursors CRC people finding colonoscopy.
