 obese hyperglycemic (ob/ob) mice, compared controls, hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) activity enhanced 35.63% (214.75 +/- 13.60 nmol/min/mg protein v 158.33 +/- 10.47, P less 0.01) measured saturating (6.6 mmol/L) concentration substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (total activity), activity recorded subsaturating (1.3 mmol/L) substrate concentration (active fraction) unchanged (86.37 +/- 6.42 v 85.66 +/- 13.59) even decreased expressed percent total activity (40.21 +/- 2.56% v 54.10 +/- 5.07, P less 0.05). Since insulin induces synthesis hepatic PK favors conversion inactive (phosphorylated) active (dephosphorylated) form, findings suggest ob/ob mice striking hyperinsulinemia, although able increase hepatic content PK, fails activate enzyme. may favor gluconeogenesis animals. hepatic concentration PK effectors (fructose-1,6-P2 phosphoenolpyruvate) unchanged ob/ob mice, vitro effect activator fructose-1,6-P2 (15 mumol/L), would favor activation (dephosphorylation) PK, preserved. suggested hepatic PK ob/ob mice resistant activation insulin.
