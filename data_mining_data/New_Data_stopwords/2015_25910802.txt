 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides mechanical circulatory support infants children postoperative cardiopulmonary failure. Nutritional support mandatory ECMO although specific actions substrates heart delineated. Prior work shows enhancing pyruvate oxidation promotes successful weaning ECMO. Accordingly, tested hypothesis prolonged systemic pyruvate supplementation activates pyruvate oxidation immature swine model vivo. Twelve male mixed-breed Yorkshire piglets (age 30-49 days) received systemic infusion either normal saline (group C) pyruvate (group P) final 6 h 8 h ECMO. final hour, piglets received [2-(13)C] pyruvate, reference substrate oxidation, [(13)C6]-l-leucine, indicator amino acid oxidation protein synthesis. significant increase lactate pyruvate concentrations occurred, along increase absolute concentration citric acid cycle intermediates. increase anaplerotic flux pyruvate carboxylation group P occurred compared change pyruvate oxidation. Additionally, pyruvate promoted increase phosphorylation state several nutrient-sensitive enzymes, like AMP-activated protein kinase acetyl CoA carboxylase, suggesting activation fatty acid oxidation. Pyruvate also promoted O-GlcNAcylation hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. conclusion, although prolonged pyruvate supplementation alter pyruvate oxidation, elicit changes nutrient- energy-sensitive pathways. Therefore, observed results support study pyruvate downstream effect cardiac function.
