 major cell classes brain differ developmental processes, metabolism, signaling, function. better understand functions interactions cell types comprise classes, acutely purified representative populations neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, pericytes mouse cerebral cortex. generated transcriptome database eight cell types RNA sequencing used sensitive algorithm detect alternative splicing events cell type. Bioinformatic analyses identified thousands new cell type-enriched genes splicing isoforms provide novel markers cell identification, tools genetic manipulation, insights biology brain. example, data provide clues neurons astrocytes differ ability dynamically regulate glycolytic flux lactate generation attributable unique splicing PKM2, gene encoding glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. dataset provide powerful new resource understanding development function brain. ensure widespread distribution datasets, created user-friendly website (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html) provides platform analyzing comparing transciption alternative splicing profiles various cell classes brain.
