 interaction platinum complexes bovine heart pyruvate kinase (PK) studied absorption, CD, fluorescence spectroscopy enzymic activity test. results showed activity PK reduced cis-DDP potassium tetrachloroplatinate time-and concentration dependent manner. Cis-DDP less effective K2PtCl4 reducing PK activity. native enzyme showed well defined negative Cotton effect 222 208 nm indicating presence alpha-helical beta structure. Platinum binding lowered Cotton effect region 10-20% 30-50% system cis-DDP K2PtCl4, respectively. Fluorescence study showed platinum binding quenched tryptophan fluorescence suggesting binding occurs tryptophan residue proximity. PK modifications induced platinum binding would result greater resistance denaturing agents.
