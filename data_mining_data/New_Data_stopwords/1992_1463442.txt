 activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase purified PDH complex pig kidney sensitive changes ionic strength. enzyme optimum activity within small range ionic strength (0.03-0.05 M). increase ionic strength 0.04 0.2 lowers activity PDH kinase 32% decreases Km ATP 25 microM 10 microM. constant ionic strength (0.15 M) enzyme optimum activity broad pH range (7.2-8.0). PDH kinase stimulated 2.2-fold 20 mM-K+, whereas Na+ even high concentration (80 mM) effect enzyme activity. stimulation PDH kinase K+ dependent pH ionic strength. PDH kinase inhibited HPO4(2-) presence K+, whereas HPO4(2-) effect activity enzyme absence K+. HPO4(2-) concentrations 2 10 mM inhibits PDH kinase 28% 55% respectively. magnitude inhibition dependent ATP/ADP ratio. Inhibition HPO4(2-) concentration range 0-10 mM non-competitive respect ATP, becomes mixed-type concentrations 10 mM. Ki HPO4(2-) 10 mM. HPO4(2-) replaced SO4(2-), effects activity PDH kinase observed. PDH kinase also inhibited Cl-. presence 80 mM-Cl- PDH kinase inhibited 40%. inhibition Cl- dependent K+. conclusion, postulate changes phosphate concentrations may play significant role regulation PDH kinase activity vivo.
