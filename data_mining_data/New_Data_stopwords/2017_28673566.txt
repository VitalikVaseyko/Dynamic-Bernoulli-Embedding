 cancer usually follows reproduction, generally assumed cancer select. Graham however argued juvenile cancer, precedes reproduction, could evolution implemented "cancer selection" resulted novel traits suppress juvenile cancer; example protection UV sunlight-induced cancer, required emergence terrestrial animals sea. modify cancer selection mechanism posited "cancer adaptation" mechanism, juvenile mortality enhanced diminished care received juveniles (grand) parents suffer cancer old age. Moreover, posited cancer adaptation selects germline "dissipative genes", genes result enhanced free energy dissipation. Cancer's progression interpreted cascade increasing scale repeated amplification energy dissipation, cascade involving heat shock, Warburg effect, cytokine IL-6, tumours, hypermetabolism. Disturbance physiological process must enhance energy dissipation animal remains functioning normally, explains multicausality, "everything gives cancer". hypothesis thus comprises two newly invoked partial processes-diminished (grand) parental care dissipation amplification-and results "selection enhanced energy dissipation" gives evolution benefit energy conservation. Due benefit, cancer would essentially adaptation, genetic disease, assumed "somatic mutation theory". Cancer somatic mutations side process. cancer adaptation hypothesis substantiated (1) cancer's extancy, (2) failure somatic mutation theory, (3) cancer's initiation high temperature, (4) interpretation cancer's progression thermal process, (5) interpretation tumours organs implement thermogenesis. hypothesis could principle verified monitoring population several generations (1) presence dissipative genes, (2) incidence cancer, (3) beneficial effect dissipative gene removal cancer starvation/famine survival.
