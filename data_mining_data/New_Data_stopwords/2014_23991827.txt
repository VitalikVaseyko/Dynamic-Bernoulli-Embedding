 role peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) activation global gene expression mitochondrial fuel utilization investigated human myotubes. 21 genes up-regulated 3 genes down-regulated activation PPARdelta agonist GW501516. Pathway analysis showed up-regulated mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, TCA cycle cholesterol biosynthesis. GW501516 increased oleic acid oxidation mitochondrial oxidative capacity 2-fold. Glucose uptake oxidation reduced, total substrate oxidation affected, indicating fuel switch glucose fatty acid. Cholesterol biosynthesis increased, lipid biosynthesis mitochondrial content affected. study confirmed principal effect PPARdelta activation increase mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative capacity. results suggest PPARdelta activation reduced glucose utilization switch mitochondrial substrate preference up-regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 genes involved lipid metabolism fatty acid oxidation.
