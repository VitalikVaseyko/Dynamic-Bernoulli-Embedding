 Pyruvate kinase purified cat trout muscle. enzymes similar amino acid compositions subunit molecular weights. contrast mammalian enzyme, trout muscle pyruvate kinase activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. However, unlike L-type pyruvate kinase mammalian liver phosphorylated cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase. purified enzyme cat muscle carboxymethylated iodo[2-14C]acetic acid conditions led preferential labelling one especially reactive thiol group. labelled enzyme cleaved CNBr, radioactive fragment purified. Amino acid sequence analysis reactive-thiol-containing fragment cat muscle pyruvate kinase showed following sequence: Ile-Gly-Arg-[14C]CmCys-Asn-Arg-Ala-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-Ile-CmCys-Ala-Thr-Gln- Hse. corresponding peptide trout pyruvate kinase one difference amino acid composition sequence around reactive thiol identical.
