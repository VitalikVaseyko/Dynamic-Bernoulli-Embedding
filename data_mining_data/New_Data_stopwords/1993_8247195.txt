 oxidative injury erythrocytes, red blood cell (RBC) rigidity splenic hemolysis assayed 17 chronically hemodialyzed patients recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) treatment. stable hematocrit 30 35% established least 4 months, statistically significant increase RBC volume, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, several RBC enzymes (2,3-diphosphoglycerate, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase) noted. indicated significant RBC rejuvenation influence EPO. However, significant improvement RBC oxidative sensitivity, RBC deformability, splenic RBC volume, slow mixing splenic RBC volume, intrasplenic RBC transit time could disclosed. data confirm existence extra-erythrocytic factor uremic plasma, partly responsible reduced RBC life span hemodialysis patients despite EPO treatment.
