 glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) cell membrane glycoprotein involved glucose uptake. increased expression Glut-1 important cell adaptation mechanism hypoxia. upregulation Glut-1 found several types malignant tumors, able reprogram metabolism oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). However, data regarding melanocytic lesions equivocal. performed comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis Glut-1 expression 225 malignant melanomas (MM) 175 benign nevi. membranous expression Glut-1 regarded positive. expression Glut-1 (the cut-off positivity determined H-score 15) found 69/225 malignant melanomas. number positive cases H-score Glut-1 increased higher Breslow thickness (p < 0.00001) comparing pT1- pT4 MM groups. benign nevi classified negative. conclusion, membranous expression Glut-1 common feature malignant melanoma type expression rare benign melanocytic nevi. results suggest membranous expression Glut-1 used surrogate marker assessing biological nature benign malignant melanocytic lesions. However, despite high specificity, sensitivity marker relatively low. Moreover, due fact increased expression Glut-1 correlates shorter survival period (10-year disease free survival, recurrence free survival metastasis free survival MFS), used prognostically adverse factor.
