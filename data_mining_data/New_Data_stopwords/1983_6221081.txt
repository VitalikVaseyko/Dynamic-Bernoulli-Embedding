 Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) cerebral ischemia produced occlusion right common left external carotid arteries. Gerbils classified according neurological appearance "symptom-negative" (8 animals), "mild symptoms" (unilateral hemiparesis, 10 animals) "severe symptoms" (hemiparesis rolling seizures, 8 animals). Two hours vascular occlusion various substrates enzymes related energy-producing metabolism, assessed tissue samples hemispheres. symptom-negative animals, change slight decrease glycolytic intermediates right hemisphere. animals mild symptoms, right hemisphere additionally exhibited impairment redox energy state enhancement activity enzymes glycolytic pathway, except hexokinase. animals severe symptoms, changes even pronounced affected--to lesser degree--also left hemisphere. results obtained demonstrate neurological appearance animals vascular occlusion correlates biochemical alterations and, therefore, used estimating density graded ischemia.
