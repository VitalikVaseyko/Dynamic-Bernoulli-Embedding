 Light scanning electron microscopic examination fresh erythrocytes blood four patients splenectomized severe pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency haemolytic anaemia revealed three morphologically different cell populations. striking patients presence crenated red cells (30-50% total) fit current criteria definition echinocytes, also unusual surface retraction compatible existence intracellular shrinkage, phenomenon known occur incubation PK deficient red cells vitro. Additional cell types include immature reticulocytes (7-8% total) thin macrocytic discocytes (45-65% total) none considered specific disease. morphological findings sharp contrast paucity red cell shape abnormalities usually described PK deficient patients splenectomy may provide insight mechanisms leading accelerated erythrocyte destruction disease.
