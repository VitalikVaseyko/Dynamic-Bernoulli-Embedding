 Regulation mitochondrial respiration situ muscle cells studied using fully permeabilized muscle fibers cardiomyocytes. results show kinetics regulation mitochondrial respiration situ exogenous ADP different kinetics regulation endogenous ADP. cardiac m. soleus fibers apparent K(m) exogenous ADP regulation respiration equal 300-400 microM. However, ADP production initiated intracellular ATPase reactions, ADP concentration medium leveled 40 microM 70% maximal rate respiration achieved. Respiration rate maintained intracellular ATPases suppressed 20-30% exogenous trapping ADP excess pyruvate kinase (PK, 20 IU/ml) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP, 5 mM). ADP flux via external PK+PEP system decreased half activation mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Creatine (20 mM) activated respiration presence PK+PEP. concluded oxidative muscle cells mitochondria behave incorporated functional complexes adjacent ADP producing systems - MgATPases myofibrils Ca,MgATPases sarcoplasmic reticulum.
