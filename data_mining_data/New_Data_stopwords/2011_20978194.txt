 Unlike normal cells, metabolize glucose oxidative phosphorylation efficient energy production, tumor cells preferentially metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis, produces less energy facilitates incorporation glycolytic metabolites biomass needed rapid proliferation. metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis partly achieved switch splice isoforms glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. Although normal cells express pyruvate kinase M1 isoform (PKM1), tumor cells predominantly express M2 isoform (PKM2). Switching PKM1 PKM2 promotes aerobic glycolysis provides selective advantage tumor formation. PKM1/M2 isoforms generated alternative splicing two mutually exclusive exons. recent study shows alternative splicing event controlled heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family members hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB; also known hnRNPI). findings provide additional evidence alternative splicing plays important role tumorigenesis, also shed light molecular mechanism hnRNP proteins regulate cell proliferation cancer.
