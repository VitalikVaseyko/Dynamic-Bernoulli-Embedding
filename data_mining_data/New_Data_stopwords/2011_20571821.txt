 Little known effect training genetic markers mitochondrial biogenesis elite athletes. tested hypothesis low-volume sprint interval exercise (SIE) would effective high-volume interval exercise (IE). Ten male cyclists competing national elite level (W (max) 403 +/- 13 W, VO(2peak) 68 +/- 1 mL kg(-1) min(-1)) performed two interval exercise protocols: 7 x 30-s "all-out" bouts (SIE) 3 x 20-min bouts ~87% VO(2peak) (IE). IE, work eightfold larger (1,095 +/- 43 vs. 135 +/- 5 kJ) exercise duration 17 times longer (60 vs. 3.5 min) SIE. Muscle samples taken 3 h exercise. mRNA upstream markers mitochondrial biogenesis [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1alpha), PGC-1alpha-related coactivator (PRC) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta)] increased extent SIE IE (6-, 1.5- 1.5-fold increase, respectively). downstream targets PGC-1alpha, mitochondrial transcription factor (Tfam) increased SIE significantly different IE (P < 0.05), whereas others increased extent (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, PDK4) unchanged (nuclear respiratory factor 2, NRF2). conclude upstream genetic markers mitochondrial biogenesis increase similar way elite athletes one exercise session SIE IE. However, since volume duration work considerably lower SIE since Tfam, downstream target PGC-1alpha, increased SIE, conclude SIE might time-efficient training strategy highly trained individuals.
