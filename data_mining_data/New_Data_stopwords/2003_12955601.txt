 Deschampsia antarctica Desv. monocot thrives harsh conditions Antarctic Peninsula represents invaluable resource identification genes associated freezing tolerance. order identify genes regulated low temperature, initiated detailed analysis gene expression. Preliminary 2-D gels vivo-labeled leaf proteins showed qualitative quantitative differences cold-acclimated non-acclimated plants, suggesting differential gene expression. Similarly, cold-acclimation-related transcripts screened differential display method. 38 cDNAs initially identified, three cDNA clones characterized protein encoding, expression pattern, response several stresses, tissue-specific expression. Northern blot analysis DaGrx, DaRub1, DaPyk1 encoding glutaredoxin, related-to-ubiquitin protein, pyruvate kinase-like protein, respectively, showed distinct regulation pattern cold-acclimation process, cases, cold response seemed tissue specific. three transcripts seem responsive water stress levels up-regulated polyethyleneglycol treatment. DaRUB1 DaPyk1 expression up-regulated leaf crown, down-regulated roots cold-acclimated plants. significance results cold-acclimation process discussed.
