 renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may alter cardiac energy metabolism heart failure. Angiotensin II (ANG II), main effector RAS heart failure, emerged important regulator cardiac hypertrophy energy metabolism. studied metabolic perturbations insulin response ANG II-induced hypertrophy model. Ex vivo heart perfusion showed hearts ANG II-treated mice lower response insulin significantly reduced rates glucose oxidation association increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) levels. Palmitate oxidation rates significantly reduced response insulin vehicle-treated hearts remained unaltered ANG II-treated hearts. Furthermore, phosphorylation Akt also less response insulin ANG II-treated wild-type (WT) mice, suggestive insulin resistance. evaluated role PDK4 ANG II-induced pathology showed deletion PDK4 prevented ANG II-induced diastolic dysfunction normalized glucose oxidation basal levels. ANG II-induced reduction levels deacetylase, SIRT3, associated increased acetylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) reduced PDH activity. conclusion, findings show combination insulin resistance decrease PDH activity involved ANG II-induced reduction glucose oxidation, resulting cardiac inefficiency. ANG II reduces PDH activity via acetylation PDH complex, well increased phosphorylation response increased PDK4 levels.
