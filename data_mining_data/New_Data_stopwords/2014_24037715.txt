 Solid tumours undergo considerable alterations metabolism nutrients order generate sufficient energy biomass sustained growth proliferation. growth, tumour microenvironment exerts number influences (e.g. hypoxia acidity) affect cellular biology flux utilisation fuels including glucose. tumour spheroid model used characterise utilisation glucose describe alterations activity expression key glycolytic enzymes tissue growth curve. Glucose avidly consumed associated production lactate acidified medium, confirming reliance glycolytic pathways diminution oxidative phosphorylation. expression levels activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase glycolytic pathway measured assess glycolytic capacity. Similar measurements made glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, entry point regulatory step pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, key link TCA cycle intermediates. parameters key enzymes shown undergo considerable variation growth curve tumour spheroids. addition, revealed dynamic alterations influenced transcriptional posttranslational mechanisms.
