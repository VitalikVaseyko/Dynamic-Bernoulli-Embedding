 current study emphasizes crucial role pineal gland effects chronic training different tissues focusing carbohydrate metabolism. investigated maximal oxygen uptake (aerobic power), muscle liver glycogen content, also enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism rat adipose tissue. Pinealectomized sham-operated adult male Wistar rats distributed four groups: pinealectomized (PINX) untrained, pinealectomized trained, control untrained control trained. maximal oxygen uptake capability assayed training protocol indirect open circuit calorimetry. rats killed 8 wk training. Blood samples collected glucose insulin determinations. glycogen content assayed liver muscle. Maximal activities epididymal adipose tissue enzymes (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase malic enzyme) well adipocyte size determined. exercise training control animals promoted increase aerobic power liver glycogen content caused reduction malic enzyme activity adipose tissue. However, PINX trained animals, contrast trained controls, showed decrease aerobic power liver muscle glycogen content, well increase activity adipocyte enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism. conclusion, data show pineal gland integrity necessary homeostatic control energy metabolism among adipose, muscle hepatic tissues. pinealectomized animals showed alterations adaptive responses maximal oxygen uptake training. Therefore, pineal gland must considered influential participant complex adaptation exercise involved improvement endurance capacity.
