 Previous studies linkage enzymatically catalyzed ATP-generating reactions red blood cell membrane sodium potassium transport control overall glycolysis human erythrocytes controversial. study significant amount pyruvate kinase activity shown localized within membrane. Membrane fragments produce 20.5 mumol ATP per 10(10) membranes per hour phosphoenolpyruvate ADP. kinetics membrane-localized pyruvate kinase differ enzyme hemolysates. results clearly document presence second ATP-generating enzyme glycolysis, pyruvate kinase, human red blood cell membranes. main fraction enzyme deeply hidden lipid layers membrane. demasked mechanical desintegration membranes high levels activity. suggested amount membrane-localized fraction pyruvate kinase related clinical severity hemolytic process pyruvate kinase deficiency.
