 Homing endonucleases (HEs) used induce targeted genome modification reduce fitness pathogen vectors malaria-transmitting Anopheles gambiae correct deleterious mutations genetic diseases. describe creation extensive set variants novel DNA cleavage specificities using integrated experimental computational approach. Using computational modeling improved selection strategy, optimizes specificity addition activity, engineered endonuclease cleave gene associated Anopheles sterility another cleave near mutation causes pyruvate kinase deficiency. course work observed unanticipated context-dependence bases need mechanistically understood reprogramming specificity succeed generally.
