 Increased hepatic glucose output one major causes fasting hyperglycemia diabetic patients. study, investigated mechanism action coagulanolide hepatic glucose, regulating enzymes type 2 diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db (db/db) mice. Coagulanolide active component Withania coagulans fruit. Oral administration coagulanolide 3 weeks decreases fasting blood glucose plasma insulin significantly, improves glucose tolerance db/db mice group. enzyme activity protein expression glucokinase pyruvate kinase significantly enhanced coagulanolide-treated db/db group compared untreated one. hand, activities protein expression fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glycogen phosphorylase enzymes significantly lowered treated group. treatment coagulanolide also normalizes concentrations plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acid, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol db/db mice. findings suggested coagulanolide useful control fasting hyperglycemia type 2 diabetes regulating production hepatic glucose.
