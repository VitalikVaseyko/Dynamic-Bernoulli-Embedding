 large part hexokinase activity rat brain 20,000g supernatant became mitochondrial bound incubated rat heart mitochondria pretreated glucose-6-phosphate. binding dependent small-molecular compounds (as yet unidentified) brain supernatant. Divalent cations, spermine, pentalysine strongly stimulated binding brain supernatant hexokinase heart mitochondria. Inorganic phosphate, alpha-glycerophosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate showed stimulatory effect. effect observed insulin glucose. Mitochondria isolated hearts fasted rats less specific hexokinase activity mitochondria fasted carbohydrate refed rats. dietary treatment significant effect total heart hexokinase activity. Oligomycin inhibit formation creatine phosphate glucose-6-phosphate isolated rabbit heart mitochondria incubated presence phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. However, presence creatine inhibited formation glucose-6-phosphate ATP/ADP ratio low, indicating creatine kinase greater access ATP/ADP translocation hexokinase.
