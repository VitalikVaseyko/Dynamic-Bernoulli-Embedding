 diauxic shift Saccharomyces cerevisiae ideal model study eukaryotic cells readjust metabolism glycolytic gluconeogenic operation. work, generated time-resolved physiological data, quantitative metabolome (69 intracellular metabolites) proteome (72 enzymes) profiles. found diauxic shift accomplished three key events temporally organized: (i) reduction glycolytic flux production storage compounds glucose depletion, mediated downregulation phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase reactions; (ii) upon glucose exhaustion, reversion carbon flow glycolysis onset glyoxylate cycle operation triggered increased expression enzymes catalyze malate synthase cytosolic citrate synthase reactions; (iii) later stages adaptation, shutting pentose phosphate pathway change NADPH regeneration. Moreover, identified transcription factors associated observed changes protein abundances. Taken together, results represent important contribution toward systems-level understanding adaptation realized.
