 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) one leading causes mortality related cancer world. better understand molecular mechanisms HCC metastasis, analyzed proteome three HCC cell lines different metastasis potentials quantitative proteomics bioinformatics analysis. result, identified 378 cellular proteins potentially associated HCC metastasis, constructed highly connected protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Functional annotation network uncovered prominent pathways key roles proteins, suggesting metabolism cytoskeleton biological processes greatly involved HCC metastasis. Furthermore, integrative network analysis revealed rich-club organization within PPI network, indicating hub center connections. rich-club nodes include several well-known cancer-related proteins, proto-oncogene non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Moreover, differential expressions two identified proteins, including PKM2 actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (ARPC4), validated using Western blotting. two proteins revealed potential prognostic markers HCC shown survival rate analysis.
