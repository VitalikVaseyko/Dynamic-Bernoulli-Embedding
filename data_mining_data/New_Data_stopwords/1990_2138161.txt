 Changes mRNA levels mammalian myogenesis compared seven polypeptides mitochondrial respiration (the mitochondrial DNA-encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit III, ATP synthase subunit 6, NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1 2, 16S ribosomal RNA; nuclear encoded ATP synthase beta subunit adenine nucleotide translocase) three polypeptides glycolysis (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, triose-phosphate isomerase). Progressive changes conversion myoblasts myotubes monitored atmospheric oxygen (normoxic) hypoxic environments. Northern analyses revealed coordinate, biphasic, reciprocal expression respiratory glycolytic mRNAs myogenesis. normoxic cells mitochondrial respiratory enzymes highest myoblasts, declined 3- 5-fold commitment exist cell cycle, increased progressively myotubes matured. contrast, glycolytic enzyme mRNAs rose 3- 6-fold commitment progressively declined. partially differentiated myotubes switched hypoxic conditions, glycolytic enzyme mRNAs increased respiratory mRNAs declined. Hence, developmental regulation muscle bioenergetic metabolism appears regulated pretranslational level modulated oxygen tension.
