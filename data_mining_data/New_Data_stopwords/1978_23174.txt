 Effects glucose concentration anoxia upon metabolite concentrations rates glycolysis respiration investigated perfused liver fetal guinea pig. cases metabolite concentrations perfused liver similar observed vivo. 50 days term fall respiratory rate concentration ATP fructose 1,6-diphosphate increase concentration glutamate, glycogen glucose. Reducing medium glucose concentration 10 mM 1 mM 0.1 mM depressed lactate production concentration phosphorylated intermediates (except 6-phosphogluconate) liver 50-day fetus. indicates fall glycolytic rate accord known kinetic properties hexokinase fetal liver. Anoxia increased lactate production by, concentrations of, hexose phosphates ADP AMP 50-day term fetal liver, concentration ribulose 5-phosphate, ATP triose phosphates fell. results consistent activation glycolysis, particularly phosphofructokinase reduction pentose phosphate pathway activity, particularly 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. calculated cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio perfused liver similar measured vivo evidence presented suggest dihydroxyacetone phosphate/glycerol 3-phosphate ratio gives better indication cytosolic redox lactate/pyruvate ratio. present observations indicate phosphofructokinase hexokinase possibly pyruvate kinase control glycolytic rate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase equilibrium perfused liver fetal guinea pig.
