 activity following enzymes clinically normal newborn calves investigated: glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (APh), creatine phosphokinase (CPhK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), leucine-aminopeptidase (LAP), aldolase (A), cholinesterase (ChE). studies carried first hour prior offering colostrum well 6th, 12th, 24th hr 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 10th, 15th, 20th day following first intake. Regularly rising values enzyme activity 24th hour observed APh, GOT, GPT, CPhK, LAP. aldolase enzyme (after colostrum given first time) animals showed statistically significant drop activity 6th hour. activity LDH displayed consistently rising trend end experimental period. cholinesterase activity showed high values immediately following birth, reaching found dams end observation period.
