 study expression alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) mRNA affected protein vitamin E status, Long-Evans male weanling rats fed vitamin E-deficient (DE), high vitamin E (HE, 5 g/kg diet all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) control (C) diet 12 wk Experiment 1; fed low-protein (LP) control (C) diet 6 wk Experiment 2. high deficient vitamin E status DE groups Experiment 1 confirmed changes plasma pyruvate kinase activity well concentrations alpha-tocopherol plasma liver. shown Northern Western Blot Analysis, expression alpha-TTP liver DE group significantly lower than, group different from, controls. contrast, alpha-TTP mRNA levels differ among C, DE groups. alpha-Tocopherol peripheral tissues rats fed LP diet Experiment 2 significantly lower C. alpha-TTP mRNA significantly lower LP group C. results suggested dietary vitamin E affect alpha-TTP gene expression except protein levels liver lowered vitamin E deficiency. hand, protein inadequacy appeared down-regulate expression alpha-TTP gene.
