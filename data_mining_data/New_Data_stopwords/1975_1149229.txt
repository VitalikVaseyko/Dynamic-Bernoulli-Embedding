 Kinetic enzymatic methods analysis substrates made optimum sensitive photometric analyzer adjusting activity triggering (catalyzing) enzyme reaction rate maximum time measurement. tat optimum activity, exponential time constant exhaustion substrate equals time triggering rate measurement. scale factor (defined measured activity divided sample concentration reaction mixture) tests. Sensitivity substrate concentration predictable instrumental absorbance uncertainty molar absorptivity absorbing species. predictions Michaelis theory verified experimentally pyruvate lactate triggered lactate dehydrogenase, glucose triggered hexokinase, triglycerides triggered glycerol kinase, reaction rate measured 30 triggering. Sensitivities 1.5 times 10(-7) mol/liter achieved. Serum diluted 1000-fold analyzed glucose gave repeatability 25 mg/liter linearity 4.0 g/liter. Samples diluted 300-fold analyzed triglycerides gave 30 mg/liter repeatability, linearity concentrations exceeding 3.0 g/liter.
