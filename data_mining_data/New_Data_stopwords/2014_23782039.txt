 INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis mitochondrial disorders challenging, highly variable clinical manifestations age-of-onset shortage specific diagnostic tools. Recent molecular studies found serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) potential biomarker muscle-manifesting mitochondrial disease, well follow-up disease progression effect intervention. AREAS COVERED: Serum FGF21 biomarker compared conventional serum diagnostic tools mitochondrial disorders. EXPERT OPINION: Mitochondrial disorders large group different progressive disorders, age-of-onset neonatal life late adulthood, symptoms originating organ system sharing underlying cause mitochondrial dysfunction. prevalence disorders 1:2000, varying somewhat different countries. Serum diagnostic tools include lactate, pyruvate, ratio, creatine kinase amino acids. However, none markers sensitive specific. Increased levels FGF21 cytokine recently found serum patients, muscle-manifesting mitochondrial disease, thus providing promising, novel, sensitive specific biomarker disorders.
