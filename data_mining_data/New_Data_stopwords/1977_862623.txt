 Full activation rat liver pyruvate dehydrogenase vitro ADP prevented palmitoyl-CoA concentration sufficiently low preclude substrate effects secondary oxidation mitochondria. Activation pyruvate dehydrogenase ADP livers fat-fed rats less control animal. results consistent experiments demonstrating inhibition adenine nucleotide translocase increased intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio palmitoyl-CoA could account effect pyruvate dehydrogenase. Inactivation brain pyruvate dehydrogenase ATP also diminished palmitoyl-CoA indicating effect level adenine nucleotides rather either pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase phosphatase enzymes.
