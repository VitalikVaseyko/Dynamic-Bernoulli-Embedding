 1. normal development key enzymes gluconeogenesis rat liver, glucose 6-phosphatase, hexose diphosphatase, phosphopyruvate carboxylase pyruvate carboxylase, measured neonatal period. 2. Glucose 6-phosphatase, hexose diphosphatase pyruvate carboxylase present late foetal liver, enzymes show increase activity birth. 3. Phosphopyruvate carboxylase present liver extracts foetal rats, activity appears immediately birth increases rapidly first day slowly reach maximum fourth postnatal day. 4. fluorinated synthetic glucocorticoid, triamcinolone, administered foetal rats various gestation times intraperitoneal injection utero animals killed intervals 4 48hr. later. 5. administration triamcinolone results slight depression glucose 6-phosphatase, significant depression hexose diphosphatase one-half normal activity foetal rat liver. 6. Triamcinolone injection without effect pyruvate carboxylase activity result premature appearance phosphopyruvate carboxylase foetal rat liver. 7. Pyruvate kinase aspartate amino-transferase activities foetal rat liver depressed triamcinolone treatment, whereas phosphofructokinase activity elevated. 8. Tyrosine amino-transferase activity foetal rat liver markedly elevated animals exposed triamcinolone 10hr. more, effect observed animals close term. 9. results discussed relation mechanisms involved initial synthesis tissue-specific enzymes developing tissues, concluded glucocorticoids initiate synthesis gluconeogenic enzymes.
