 Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) plays critical role reprogramming cancer metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis (i.e., Warburg effect), critical supplying cancer cells biomass needed proliferation. Previous studies shown cetuximab, EGF receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody, downregulates alpha subunit HIF-1 (HIF-1alpha) inhibition EGF receptor downstream cell signaling downregulation HIF-1alpha required cetuximab-induced antiproliferative effects. However, mechanism underlying actions yet identified. study, used Seahorse XF96 extracellular flux analyzer assess effect cetuximab treatment changes glycolysis mitochondrial respiration, two major energy-producing pathways, live cells. found cetuximab downregulated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) inhibited glycolysis cetuximab-sensitive head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells HIF-1alpha downregulation-dependent manner. HNSCC cells acquired cetuximab resistance expressed high level HIF-1alpha highly glycolytic. Overexpression HIF-1alpha mutant (HIF-1alpha/DeltaODD) conferred resistance cetuximab-induced G1 phase cell-cycle arrest, could overcome knockdown LDH-A expression. Inhibition LDH-A activity oxamate enhanced response cetuximab-resistant cells cetuximab. Cetuximab noticeable inhibitory effect glycolysis nontransformed cells. findings provide novel mechanistic insights cetuximab-induced cell-cycle arrest perspective cancer metabolism suggest novel strategies enhancing cetuximab response.
