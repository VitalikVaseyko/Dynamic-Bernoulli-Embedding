 Using several techniques, assessed morphological characteristics malignant thymic tumour SV12 transgenic (Tg) mice expressing SV40 antigens control L-PK promoter. describe development carcinoma originating thymic hyperplasia followed formation benign tumour composed chiefly medullary epithelial cells expressing transgene lymphocytes, pathology rarely reported mice. study SV12 Tg mice represents first description model pure malignant thymic tumour associated extensive angiogenesis maintained numerous descendants. formation large tumoral neovascular network, observed here, never described human and/or experimental thymic tumours. Tumoral transformation angiogenesis demonstrated immunolabelling antibodies various cytokeratins (CKs) different molecular weights, vascular endothelial cell markers VEGF/receptor-2 (Flk-1) present neovascular endothelial cells. Different points raised originality model discussed. include medullary nature cells expressing SV40 transgene relationship tumoral development. subset different molecular weight CK components modifications also considered, well presence type IV epithelial cells, progenitors medullary epithelial cells. Finally, cell signals involved angiogenesis possible action angiogenic factor, probably secreted tumoral cells themselves, discussed.
