 Tumor cells rely mainly glycolysis energy production even presence sufficient oxygen, phenomenon termed Warburg effect, outstanding characteristic energy metabolism cancer cells. metabolic adaptation believed critical tumor cell growth proliferation, number onco-proteins tumor suppressors, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, Myc, hypoxia-inducible factor p53, involved regulation metabolic adaptation. Moreover, glycolytic cancer cells often invasive impervious therapeutic intervention. Thus, altered energy metabolism appreciated hallmark cancer promising target cancer treatment. better understanding biology regulatory mechanisms aerobic glycolysis potential facilitate development glycolysis-based therapeutic interventions cancer. addition, glycolysis inhibition combined DNA damaging drugs chemotherapeutic agents may effective anticancer strategies weakening cell damage repair capacity enhancing drug cytotoxicity.
