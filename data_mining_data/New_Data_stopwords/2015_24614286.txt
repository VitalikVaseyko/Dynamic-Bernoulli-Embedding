 tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle central route oxidative metabolism. Besides responsible production NADH FADH2, fuel mitochondrial electron transport chain generate ATP, TCA cycle also robust source metabolic intermediates required anabolic reactions. particularly important highly proliferating cells, like tumour cells, require continuous supply precursors synthesis lipids, proteins nucleic acids. number mutations among TCA cycle enzymes discovered association tumour types established. review summarise current knowledge regarding alterations TCA cycle tumours, particular attention three germline mutations enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase isocitrate dehydrogenase, involved pathogenesis tumours, aberrant regulation TCA cycle components control oncogenes tumour suppressors.
