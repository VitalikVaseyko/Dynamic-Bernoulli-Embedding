 BACKGROUND: Plasmids reconsidered viable vector alternatives viruses gene therapies vaccines safer, non-toxic, simpler produce. Accordingly, renewed interest production plasmid DNA therapeutic end-product bioprocess. Improvement best current yields productivities emerging processes would help ensure economic feasibility industrial scale. goal, therefore, develop stoichiometric model Escherichia coli metabolism order (1) determine maximum theoretical plasmid-producing capacity, (2) identify factors significantly impact plasmid production. RESULTS: model developed production high copy plasmid conditions batch aerobic growth glucose minimal medium. objective model maximize plasmid production. employing certain constraints examining resulting flux distributions, several factors determined significantly impact plasmid yield. Acetate production constitutive expression plasmid's antibiotic resistance marker exert negative effects, low pyruvate kinase (Pyk) flux generation NADPH transhydrogenase activity offer positive effects. highest theoretical yield (592 mg/g) resulted conditions marker acetate production, nil Pyk flux, maximum allowable transhydrogenase activity. comparison, four fluxes constrained wild-type values, yields order tens mg/g resulted, par best experimental yields reported date. CONCLUSION: results suggest specific plasmid yields theoretically reach 12 times current experimental maximum (51 mg/g). Moreover, imply abolishing Pyk activity and/or transhydrogenase up-regulation would useful strategies implement designing host strains plasmid production; mutations reduce acetate production would also advantageous. results suggest using means plasmid selection antibiotic resistance, least weakening marker's expression, would beneficial would allow precursor metabolites, energy, reducing power put toward plasmid production. Thus far, impact eliminating Pyk activity explored experimentally, significantly higher plasmid yields resulting.
