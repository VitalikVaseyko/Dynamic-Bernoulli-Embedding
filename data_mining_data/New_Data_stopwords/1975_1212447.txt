 Pyruvatekinase (PK) isoenzymes isolated means (NH4)2SO4 fractionation (20-45% 50-70% saturation) DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Two peaks PK activity (I II) discovered chromatography 20-45% saturation precipitate, one peak (I-A)-under chromatography 50-70% saturation precipitate. PK-II properties (two-peaks kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), resistance effectors) like L-type PK, lost allosteric properties process long-term isolation low temperatures. PK-I PK-I-A S-form kinetics PEP. inhibited L-alanine phenylalanine, probably variants initial K(M2) type.
