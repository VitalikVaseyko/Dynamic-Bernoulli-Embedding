 tested hypothesis high-fat diet (75% fat; 5% carbohydrates; 20% protein), 15% fat content substituted n-3 fatty acids, would exhibit diet-induced increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity, normally observed human skeletal muscle. fat content regular high-fat diet (HF) n-3-substituted diet (N3). PDK activity increased high-fat diets, increase attenuated N3 diet (0.051 +/- 0.007 0.218 +/- 0.047 min(-1) pre- post-HF, respectively; vs. 0.073 +/- 0.016 0.133 +/- 0.032 min(-1) pre- post-N3, respectively). However, active form pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) activity decreased similar extent conditions (0.93 +/- 0.17 0.43 +/- 0.09 mmol/kg wet wt pre- post-HF; vs. 0.87 +/- 0.19 0.39 +/- 0.05 mmol/kg wet wt pre- post-N3, respectively). suggested difference PDK activity affect PDHa activation basal state, regulated intramitochondrial effectors, primarily muscle pyruvate concentration. Muscle glycogen content consistent throughout study, diet conditions, whereas muscle glucose-6-phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate, lactate, pyruvate decreased high-fat diets. Plasma triglycerides decreased high-fat diets decreased greater extent N3, whereas plasma free fatty acids increased diets, lesser extent N3. summary, PDK activity decreased high-fat diet rich n-3 fatty acids, although PDHa activity unaltered. addition, data demonstrated hypolipidemic effect n-3 fatty acids occurs earlier (3 days) previously reported evident even diet 75% total energy derived fat.
