 mechanisms lactogenic hormones promote beta-cell expansion remain poorly understood. prolactin (PRL) up-regulates beta-cell glucose transporter 2, glucokinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase activities, reasoned glucose availability might mediate modulate effects PRL beta-cell mass. Here, used male rat islets show PRL glucose differential complementary effects expression cell cyclins, cell cycle inhibitors, various genes known regulate beta-cell replication, including insulin receptor substrate 2, IGF-II, menin, forkhead box protein M1, tryptophan hydroxylase 1, PRL receptor. Differential effects gene expression associated synergistic effects glucose PRL islet DNA synthesis. effects PRL gene expression mirrored beta-cell overexpression signal transducer activator transcription 5b opposed dexamethasone. ad-small interfering RNA specific cyclin D2 attenuates markedly effects PRL islet DNA synthesis. studies suggest new paradigm control beta-cell mass insulin production hormones nutrients. PRL up-regulates beta-cell glucose uptake utilization, whereas glucose increases islet PRL receptor expression potentiates effects PRL cell cycle gene expression DNA synthesis. findings suggest novel targets prevention neonatal glucose intolerance gestational diabetes may provide new insight pathogenesis beta-cell hyperplasia obese subjects insulin resistance.
