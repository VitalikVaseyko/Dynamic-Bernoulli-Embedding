 Human coronavirus 229E, n enveloped, RNA-containing virus, causes respiratory illness man serologically related murine coronavirus JHM, causes acute chronic demyelination rodents. 229E displays species-specific host range restriction whose genetic basis studied human-mouse hybrids. 229E replicated human WI-38 cells three mouse cell lines tested (RAG, LM/TK-, A9). Human coronavirus sensitivity (HCVS) expressed dominant phenotype hybrids, indicating mouse cells actively suppress 229E replication. HCVS segregated concordantly human chromosome 15 enzyme markers mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) muscle form pyruvate kinase (PKM2), analysis hybrids containing X/15 translocation [t(X;15)(p11;q11)] localized HCVS q11 leads qter region chromosome 15. HCVS might code specific surface receptor, allowing 229E absorbed received within host cell.
