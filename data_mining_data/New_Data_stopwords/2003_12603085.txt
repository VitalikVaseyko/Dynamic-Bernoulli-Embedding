 Glycolysis main route provides energy brain functioning. study investigated vitro effects phenylalanine, main metabolite known accumulate phenylketonuria, and/or alanine, pyruvate kinase activity, glucose utilization, lactate release, ADP concentration brain cortex homogenates 30-day-old Wistar rats. found phenylalanine decreased PK activity, glucose utilization, lactate release, increased ADP brain levels. also verified alanine per se modify parameters, prevented effects phenylalanine. data suggest inhibition pyruvate kinase phenylalanine decreases glycolysis energy production, alanine, known competitor phenylalanine enzyme activity, prevents reduction glycolysis energy production caused phenylalanine, probably preventing enzyme inhibition provoked amino acid. results suggest inhibition brain PK activity phenylalanine may related diminution glucose metabolism observed brain phenylketonuric patients may one mechanisms responsible neurological dysfunction found patients.
