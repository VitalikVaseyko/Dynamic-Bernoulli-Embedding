 Astrocytes maintained chemically defined media undergo differentiation parallel increase pyruvate kinase specific activity. changes accompanied shift isoelectrofocusing pattern, expression pyruvate kinase M4, characteristic adult rat brain isozyme. Thus, chemically defined media lacks substance required induce pyruvate kinase synthesis function uncoupled aspects cellular differentiation. uncoupling pyruvate kinase maturation cellular differentiation observation single, 2.3 kilobase, pyruvate kinase mRNA molecule different stages postnatal development rat brain support concept K- M-isoform transformation post-transcriptional event. effect individual components chemically defined medium pyruvate kinase specific activity studied eliminating one component time. increase activity found completely dependent upon fibroblastic growth factor prostaglandin F2 alpha partially dependent simultaneous presence insulin.
