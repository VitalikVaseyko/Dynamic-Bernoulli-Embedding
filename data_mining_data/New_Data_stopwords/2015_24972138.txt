 Cancer metabolism reprogramming alterations epigenetics linked incidence cancer. apparent epigenetic changes found tumors, therefore, complete epigenome entire pathways relevant cell metabolism subject epigenetic dysregulation. Here, review pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform, glycolytic enzyme involved ATP generation pyruvate production, plays essential role tumor metabolism growth, also functions protein kinase phosphorylates histones genes transcription chromatin remodeling. also discuss potential role PKM2 dynamic integration metabolic reprogramming alterations epigenetics carcinogenesis cancer progression.
