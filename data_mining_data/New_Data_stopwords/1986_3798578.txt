 possibility thiamine phosphates participate regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity level isolated mitochondria studied. shown increase thiamine diphosphate concentration incubation medium produces significant changes pyruvate dehydrogenase activity mitochondria. pyruvate dehydrogenase activity decreases mitochondria incubated thiamine triphosphate ATP different conditions. Thiamine triphosphate able replace ATP kinase reaction isolated complex, inhibits reactivation complex exogenase phosphatase; conditions thiamine diphosphate activates phosphatase. Analysis data leads conclusion native conditions increase intramitochondrial thiamine triphosphate concentration produce drop pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity inhibition phosphatase reaction.
