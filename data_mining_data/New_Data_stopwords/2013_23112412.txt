 OBJECTIVES: study planned investigate effects pre post-treatment young inflorescence Cocos nucifera (CnI) alloxan-induced diabetic rats. MATERIALS METHODS: Male albino Sprague Dawely rats divided five groups six animals each. Group normal control, Group II diabetic control, Cocos nucifera Inflorescence (CnI) fed along diet [20% (w/w)] orally (Group III) period 11 days prior alloxan injection (150 mg/kg i.p.). curative effect CnI evaluated feeding levels alloxan-induced diabetic rats (Group IV) period 30 days. effects pretreatment post-treatment (Group V) also evaluated. Biochemical parameters serum glucose, hepatic glycogen, enzymes involving carbohydrate metabolism (hexokinase, phosphoglucomutase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose 1, 6-diphosphatase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogen phosphorylase) assayed along pancreatic histopathology. Data analyzed using one-way analysis variance followed Duncan's post hoc multiple variance test. P < 0.05 considered statistical significant. RESULTS: Diabetic control rats showed significant increase serum glucose (P < 0.05) decrease hepatic glycogen levels (P < 0.05) compared normal rats, reversed near normal CnI pretreated post-treated rats. Treatment CnI resulted significant decrease (P < 0.05) activities gluconeogenic enzymes Group III IV compared diabetic control group, glycolytic enzyme activities improved groups. cytotoxicity pancreatic islets also ameliorated treatment CnI histopathological examination. CONCLUSION: results obtained study indicate protective curative effects CnI alloxan-induced pancreatic cytotoxicity, mediated regulation carbohydrate metabolic enzyme activities islets cell repair.
