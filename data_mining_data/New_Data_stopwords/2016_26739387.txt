 BACKGROUND: Initially identified molecule regulates final step glycolysis, M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) recently reported central role metabolic reprogramming cancer cells well participating cell cycle progression gene transcription. Despite intensive efforts, intricate molecular mechanisms PKM2 regulates tumor progression remain elusive. METHODS: proliferation apoptosis various pancreatic cancer cells using lentiviral-mediated PKM2 abrogation assessed vitro via Western blot flow cytometric assay vivo experiments involved tumor xenograft chicken chorionallantoic membranes immunohistochemistry human tissue specimens. order decipher molecular mechanism HIF-1alpha p65/RelA regulation PKM2 cancer cells cultivated hypoxic atmosphere normoxia involved various biochemical assays Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, reporter gene assay ELISA. RESULTS: Strong expression PKM2 observed 68 % human pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens almost analyzed pancreatic cancer cell lines. Abrogation PKM2 resulted impaired proliferation augmented apoptosis vitro well impaired tumor growth decreased blood vessel formation vivo. Furthermore, deletion PKM2 negatively impacted hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation promoter activity ultimately resulting impaired secretion VEGF. CONCLUSIONS: study suggests hypoxic pancreatic tumors PKM2 interferes NF-kappaB/p65 HIF-1alpha activation ultimately triggers VEGF-A secretion subsequent blood vessel formation.
