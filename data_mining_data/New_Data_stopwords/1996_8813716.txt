 Red blood cells fulfil functions normal period approximately 120 days 1.7 x 10(5) circulatory cycles efficiently withstand external internal loads. requires ATP redox equivalents, permanently regenerated energy redox metabolism. pathways necessary maintain biconcave shape cells, specific intracellular cation concentrations, reduced state hemoglobin divalent iron sulfhydryl groups enzymes, glutathione membrane components. enzyme deficiency one metabolic pathways limits ATP and/or NADPH production, distinct membrane alterations result causing removal damaged cells monocyte-macrophage system. metabolic needs erythrocytes covered glycolysis, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), glutathione cycle, nucleotide metabolism MetHb reductase. Hereditary enzyme deficiencies pathways identified; cause non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia listed Table 4. frequencies differ markedly respect affected enzyme geographic distribution. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymopathies (G6PD) 400 million cases far common deficiency. highest gene frequency found 0.7 among Kurdish Jews. G6PD deficiencies furthermore prevalent frequencies 0.1 among Africans, Black Americans, populations Mediterranean countries South East Asia. Middle Northern Europe frequency G6PD much lower, approximately 0.0005, comparable frequency pyruvate kinase (PK) enzymopathies, frequent enzyme deficiency glycolysis area (Luzzatto, 1987; Beutler Kuhl, 1990). relationship degree enzyme deficiency extent metabolic dysfunction red blood cells tissues depend several factors: importance affected enzyme; expression rate; stability mutant enzyme proteolytic degradation functional abnormalities; possibility compensate deficiency overexpression corresponding isoenzyme use alternative metabolic pathway. Difficulties estimating quantitative degree disorder severe cases due fact populations contain many reticulocytes, generally higher enzyme activities concentrations intermediates erythrocytes. alternative approach predict metabolic changes analysis mathematical modeling. Mathematical modeling main metabolic pathways human erythrocytes reached advanced level (Rapoport et al., 1976; Holzhutter et al., 1985; Schuster et al., 1988). Models successfully employed describe stationary time-dependent metabolic states cell normal conditions well presence enzyme deficiencies. Figure 5 shows computational results erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies. analysis based comprehensive mathematical model energy redox metabolism human erythrocyte presented Fig. 6. Stationary states cell metabolism calculated varying activity participating enzymes several orders magnitude. predict consequences enzyme deficiencies performance function introduced (Schuster Holzhutter, 1995). takes account homeostasis three essential metabolic variables: energetic state (ATP), reductive capacity (reduced glutathione) osmotic state. data given Fig. 5 one conclude generally metabolic impairment resulting deficiencies occurs earlier enzymes high control coefficients catalyzing equilibrium reactions. hand flux curves latter enzymes decrease steeply critica
