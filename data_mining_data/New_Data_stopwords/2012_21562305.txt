 Myocyte differentiation involves complex interactions signal transduction pathways transcription factors. estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) regulate energy substrate uptake, mitochondrial respiration, biogenesis may target structural gene programs striated muscle. However, ERRalpha's role regulating myocyte differentiation known. ERRalpha peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) coordinately upregulated metabolic skeletal muscle-specific genes early myogenesis. analyzed effects ERRalpha overexpression loss function myogenic models. C2C12 myocytes ERRalpha overexpression accelerated differentiation, whereas XCT790 treatment delayed myogenesis resulted myotubes fewer mitochondria disorganized sarcomeres. ERRalpha-/- primary myocytes showed delayed myogenesis, resulting structurally immature myotubes reduced sarcomeric assembly mitochondrial function. However, sarcomeric metabolic gene expression unaffected upregulated ERRalpha-/- cells. Instead, ERRalpha-/- myocytes exhibited aberrant ERK activation early myogenesis, consistent delayed myotube formation. XCT790 treatment also increased ERK phosphorylation C2C12, whereas ERRalpha overexpression decreased early ERK activation, consistent opposing effects treatments differentiation. transient induction MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), mediates ERK dephosphorylation onset myogenesis, lost ERRalpha-/- myocytes XCT790-treated C2C12. ERRalpha-PGC-1alpha complex activates Dusp1 gene, encodes MKP-1, ERRalpha occupies proximal 5' regulatory region early differentiation C2C12 myocytes. Finally, treatment ERRalpha-/- myocytes MEK inhibitors rescued normal ERK signaling myogenesis. Collectively, data demonstrate ERRalpha required normal skeletal myocyte differentiation via modulation MAP kinase signaling.
