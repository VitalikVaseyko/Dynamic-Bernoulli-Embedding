 Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression induced hypoxia (8% O(2)) via PAI-1 promoter region -175/-159 containing hypoxia response element (HRE-2) binding hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) adjacent response element (HRE-1) binding far unknown factor. aim present study identify factor investigate role regulation PAI-1 expression. found supershift assays upstream stimulatory factor-2a (USF-2a) bound mainly HRE-1 PAI-1 promoter lesser extent HRE-2. Overexpression USF-2a inhibited PAI-1 messenger RNA protein expression activated L-type pyruvate kinase expression primary rat hepatocytes normoxia hypoxia. Luciferase (Luc) gene constructs driven 766 276 base pairs 5'-flanking region PAI-1 gene transfected primary hepatocytes together expression vectors encoding wild-type USF-2a USF-2a mutant lacking DNA binding dimerization activity (DeltaHU2a). Cotransfection wild-type USF-2a vector reduced Luc activity 8-fold, whereas cotransfection DeltaHU2a influence Luc activity. Mutation HRE-1 (-175/-168) PAI-1 promoter Luc constructs decreased USF-dependent inhibition Luc activity. Mutation HRE-2 (-165/-158) less effective. Cotransfection HIF-1alpha vector could compete binding USF HRE-2. results indicated balance 2 transcriptional factors, HIF-1 USF-2a, bind adjacent HRE sites, appears involved regulation PAI-1 expression many clinical conditions.
