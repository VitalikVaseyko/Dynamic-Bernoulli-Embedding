 Anti-angiogenic therapy glioblastoma (GBM) unfortunately led anticipated improvement patient prognosis. describe human GBM adapts bevacizumab treatment metabolic level. performing (13)C6-glucose metabolic flux analysis, show first time tumors undergo metabolic re-programming toward anaerobic metabolism, thereby uncoupling glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation. Following treatment, increased influx (13)C6-glucose observed tumors, concomitant increased lactate levels reduction metabolites associated tricarboxylic acid cycle. confirmed increased expression glycolytic enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase treated tumors. Interestingly, L-glutamine levels also reduced. results confirmed assessment vivo metabolic data obtained magnetic resonance spectroscopy positron emission tomography. Moreover, bevacizumab led depletion glutathione levels indicating treatment caused oxidative stress tumors. Confirming metabolic flux results, immunohistochemical analysis showed up-regulation lactate dehydrogenase bevacizumab-treated tumor core well single tumor cells infiltrating brain, may explain increased invasion observed bevacizumab treatment. observations validated panel eight human GBM patients paired biopsy samples obtained bevacizumab treatment. Importantly, show GBM adaptation bevacizumab therapy mediated clonal selection mechanisms, represents adaptive response therapy.
