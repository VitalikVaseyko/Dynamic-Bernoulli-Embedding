 different bacteria, primarily cytosolic metabolic proteins characterized surface localized interacting different host factors. moonlighting proteins include glycolytic enzymes, hypothesized influence virulence pathogenic species. presence surface-displayed glycolytic enzymes interaction human plasminogen important host factor investigated genome-reduced cell wall-less microorganism Mycoplasma pneumoniae, common agent respiratory tract infections humans. successful expression 19 glycolytic enzymes production polyclonal antisera, localization proteins mycoplasma cell characterized using fractionation total proteins, colony blot, mild proteolysis immunofluorescence M. pneumoniae cells. Eight glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenases C (PdhA-C), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA), lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh), phosphoglycerate mutase (Pgm), pyruvate kinase (Pyk), transketolase (Tkt), confirmed surface expressed able interact plasminogen. Plasminogen bound recombinant proteins PdhB, GapA, Pyk converted plasmin presence urokinase plasminogen activator plasmin-specific substrate d-valyl-leucyl-lysine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride. Furthermore, human fibrinogen degraded complex plasminogen recombinant protein PdhB Pgm. addition, surface-displayed proteins (except PdhC) bind human lung epithelial cells, interaction reduced significantly preincubation cells antiplasminogen. results suggest plasminogen binding activation different surface-localized glycolytic enzymes M. pneumoniae may play role successful long-term colonization human respiratory tract.
