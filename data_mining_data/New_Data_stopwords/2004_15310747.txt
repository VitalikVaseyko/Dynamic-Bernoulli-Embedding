 Whole body glucose disposal skeletal muscle hexokinase, glycogen synthase (GS), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), PDH kinase (PDK) activities measured aerobically trained men standardized control diet (Con; 51% carbohydrate, 29% fat, 20% protein total energy intake) 56-h eucaloric, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet (HF/LC; 5% carbohydrate, 73% fat, 22% protein). oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 1 g/kg) administered Con HF/LC diets vastus lateralis muscle biopsies sampled pre-OGTT 75 min ingestion oral glucose load. 90-min area blood glucose plasma insulin concentration vs. time curves increased 2-fold 1.25-fold, respectively, HF/LC diet. pre-OGTT fraction GS active form maximal activity hexokinase affected HF/LC diet. However, HF/LC diet increased PDK activity (0.19 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.02 min(-1)) decreased PDH activation (0.38 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.10 mmol acetyl-CoA.kg wet muscle(-1).min(-1)) OGTT vs. Con. OGTT, GS PDH activation increased magnitude diets, PDH activation remained lower HF/LC OGTT (0.60 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.09 mmol acetyl-CoA.kg(-1).min(-1)). data demonstrate decreased glucose disposal OGTT 56-h HF/LC diet part related decreased oxidative carbohydrate disposal skeletal muscle decreased glycogen storage. rapid increase PDK activity HF/LC diet appeared account reduced potential oxidative carbohydrate disposal.
