 Malignant neoplasms exhibit higher rate glycolysis normal cells; known Warburg effect. target it, galactose-conjugated (trans-R,R-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine)-2-chloromalonato-platinum(II) complex (Gal-Pt) designed, synthesized, evaluated five human cancer cell lines two different xenograft tumour models. Gal-Pt exhibits much higher aqueous solubility (over 25 times) improved cytotoxicity oxaliplatin, especially human colon (HT29) lung (H460) cancer cell lines. safety profile Gal-Pt investigated vivo exploring maximum tolerated dose (MTD) animal mortality rate. ratios animal lethal dosage values cytotoxicity HT29 (LD50/IC50) showed Gal-Pt associated increased therapeutic index 30-fold compared cisplatin oxaliplatin. evaluated vivo antitumor activity single agent intravenous treatment comparison studies Gal-Pt (50 mg/kg 65% MTD) cisplatin (3 mg/kg, 80% MTD) H460 lung cancer xenograft model, oxaliplatin (7 mg/kg, 90% MTD) HT29 colon cancer xenograft model. results show Gal-Pt efficacious H460 cisplatin, superior potency HT29 cells compared oxaliplatin nontoxic dosage conditions. dependency cytotoxicity Gal-Pt glucose transporters (GLUTs) investigated using quercetin inhibitor GLUTs HT29 cells. cytotoxic potency Gal-Pt highly reduced inhibitor, suggesting uptake Gal-Pt regulated glucose transporters. GLUT mediated transportability cellular uptake Gal-Pt also demonstrated using fluorescent glucose bioprobe HT29 competition assay.
