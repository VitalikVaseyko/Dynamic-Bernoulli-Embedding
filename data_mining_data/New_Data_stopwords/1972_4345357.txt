 1. purpose study determine nature metabolic changes associated carbohydrate fat metabolism occurred blood liver lactating dairy cows starvation 6 days. 2. starvation, blood concentrations free fatty acids ketone bodies increased, whereas citrate decreased. initial increase, blood concentration glucose subsequently declined starvation progressed. Starvation caused significant decrease plasma concentration serine significant increase leucine. 3. 6 days starvation hepatic concentrations oxaloacetate, citrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, glucose, glycogen, ATP NAD(+) decreased, hepatic activities phosphopyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.32) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). 4. metabolic changes similar previously found occur cows suffering spontaneous ketosis (Baird et al., 1968; Baird & Heitzman, 1971). 5. Milk yield decreased progressively starvation. 6. marked differences ability individual animals resist onset severe starvation ketosis.
