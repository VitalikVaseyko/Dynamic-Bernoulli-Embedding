 effect severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia activity pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex (PDHC) investigated homogenates frozen rat cerebral cortex burst suppression EEG, 10, 30, 60 min isoelectric EEG, 30 180 min 24 h recovery following 30 min hypoglycemic coma. Changes PDHC activity correlated levels labile organic phosphates glycolytic metabolites. cortex control animals, rate [1-14C]pyruvate decarboxylation 7.1 +/- 1.3 U/mg protein, 35% total PDHC activity. activity unchanged burst suppression EEG whereas active fraction increased 81-87% hypoglycemic coma. Thirty minutes glucose-induced recovery, PDHC activity decreased 33% compared control levels, remained significantly depressed 3 h recovery. decrease activity due decrease total PDHC activity. 24 h recovery, PDHC activity returned control levels. conclude activation PDHC hypoglycemic coma probably result increased PDH phosphatase activity following depolarization calcium influx, allosteric inhibition PDH kinase due increased ADP/ATP ratio. depression PDHC activity following hypoglycemic coma probably due increased phosphorylation enzyme, consequence imbalance PDH phosphatase kinase activities. Since reduction ATP/ADP ratio persisted since lactate/pyruvate ratio normalized 3 h recovery, depression PDHC likely reflects decrease PDH phosphatase activity, probably due decrease intramitochondrial Ca2+.
