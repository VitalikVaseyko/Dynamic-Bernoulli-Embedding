 examined morphometric biochemical effects ventricular hypertrophy male rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sexual maturation. investigation focused characterizing growth ventricular layers, cardiomyocyte dimensions (length, cross-sectional area cell volume) activities enzymes involved intermediary metabolism. Relative ventricle mass (100 x ventricle mass/body mass) increased much 2.4-fold sexual maturation [as defined increasing gonadosomatic index (100 x gonad mass/body mass)], resulted increased proportion epicardium relative endocardium. Ventricular enlargement associated increased length (+31 %) transverse cross-sectional area (+83 %) cardiomyocytes, resulted expansion 2.2-fold mean myocyte volume (from 1233 2751 micron3). results indicate sexual maturation induces ventricular enlargement myocyte hypertrophy. Cell length cross-sectional area similar myocardial layers, myocytes elliptical rather circular transverse cross section. Ventricular hypertrophy alter transverse cell shape, perhaps reflecting maintenance short diffusion distances small molecules cells hypertrophy. Myocyte hypertrophy could account entirely sevenfold range ventricle masses different-sized fish, indicating myocyte hyperplasia contributes substantially ventricular growth trout grow. Measurements maximal activities metabolic enzymes demonstrated ventricular hypertrophy associated (1) higher epicardial endocardial activities citrate synthase (by 23 %) beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (by 20 %); (2) lower activities hexokinase (by 50 %) layers, (3) change lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities, also similar layers. results suggest energetic needs hypertrophied trout ventricle may met increased reliance fatty acid oxidation, particularly endocardium, decreased reliance glucose metabolic fuel layers.
