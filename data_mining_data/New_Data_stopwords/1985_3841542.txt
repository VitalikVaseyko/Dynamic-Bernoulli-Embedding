 Benzoyl- isopentenoyl phosphoric triamides (BPA IPA) strongly inhibited urease activities jack bean, soybean, watermelon seed, Proteus mirabilis, P. rettgeri, P. vulgaris, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum. I50 values (the final concentration causing 50% inhibition), independent enzyme source, 2-21 nM, 1,000-fold lower caprylohydroxamic acid, one potent urease inhibitors. ATP-urea amidolyase activity inhibited 50% BPA higher concentration 0.28 mM, affected IPA even 1.3 mM. Thirteen kinds hydrolases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, leucine aminopeptidase, papain, lipase, alpha-amylase, glucuronidase, asparaginase, arylsulfatase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, true cholinesterase), two oxidoreductases (catalase alcohol dehydrogenase), three transferases (glutamic-oxaloacetic aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, arylsulfotransferase) two kinases (pyruvate kinase creatine kinase) affected even 1 mM BPA IPA. Exceptionally, pseudo-cholinesterase human serum inhibited BPA IPA, whose I50 values 70 nM 10 muM, respectively, using acetylthiocholine substrate. values increased 0.55 muM 54 muM, respectively, acetylcholine used substrate. results show N-acylphosphoric triamides potently specifically inhibit urease activity concentrations nM order.
