 Breast cancer heterogeneous disease genetic factors play important role genesis. Although mutations tumor suppressors oncogenes encoded nuclear genome known play critical role breast tumorigenesis, contribution mitochondrial genome process unclear. Like nuclear genome, mitochondrial genome also encodes proteins critical mitochondrion functions oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), known defective cancer including breast cancer. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) susceptible mutations due limited repair mechanisms compared nuclear DNA (nDNA). Thus changes mitochondrial genes could also contribute development breast cancer. review discuss mtDNA mutations affect OXPHOS. Continuous acquisition mtDNA mutations selection advantageous mutations ultimately leads generation cells propagate uncontrollably form tumors. Since irreversible damage OXPHOS leads shift energy metabolism towards enhanced aerobic glycolysis cancers, mutations mtDNA represent early event breast tumorigenesis, thus may serve potential biomarkers early detection prognosis breast cancer. mtDNA mutations lead defective OXPHOS, development agents target OXPHOS provide specificity preventative therapeutic agents breast cancer minimal toxicity.
