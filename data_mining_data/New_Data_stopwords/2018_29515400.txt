 Lactic acidosis commonly observed clinical condition associated poor prognosis, especially malignancies. describe case 81-year-old patient presented symptoms tachypnea general discomfort. Arterial blood gas analysis showed high anion gap acidosis lactate level 9.5 mmol/L respiratory compensation. CT scanning showed signs pulmonary embolism causes impaired tissue oxygenation. Despite treatment sodium bicarbonate, patient developed adrenalin-resistant cardiac arrest, likely caused acidosis. Autopsy revealed Gleason score 5 + 5 metastatic prostate cancer probable cause lactic acidosis. Next-generation sequencing indicated nonsense mutation TP53 gene (887delA) activating mutation PIK3CA gene (1634A>G) candidate molecular drivers. case demonstrates prevalence clinical relevance metabolic reprogramming, frequently referred "the Warburg effect," patients prostate cancer.
