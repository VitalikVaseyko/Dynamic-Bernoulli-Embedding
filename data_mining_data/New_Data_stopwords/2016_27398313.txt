 Prostate cancer second leading cause cancer-related deaths among men worldwide. Early diagnosis increases survival rates patients survival rate remained relatively poor past years. Increasing evidence shows altered metabolism critical hallmark prostate cancer. strong need explore molecular mechanisms underlying cancer metabolism prostate cancer therapy. Whether aberrant expression microRNA (miRNA) contributes cancer metabolism fully known. study, found microRNA-132 (miR-132) expression reduced thus leads metabolic switch prostate cancer cells. miR-132 performs role increasing Glut1 expression, resulting enhanced rate lactate production glucose uptake. altered metabolism induced decreased miR-132 levels confers rapid growth cancer cells. data indicate miR-132 involved regulating Warburg effect prostate cancer inhibiting Glut1 expression.
