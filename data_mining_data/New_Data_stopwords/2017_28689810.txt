 Hypoxic conditions common solid tumors significant effect tumor progression, therapeutic prognosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) longer 200 nucleotides cannot translated proteins, play important roles diseases including cancer. Although previous analysis showed long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA)-p21 hypoxia-responsive functions new regulator cell cycle, apoptosis warburg effect cervical cancer, biological roles hypoxic hepatoma glioma unknown. work, found X-ray irradiation hypoxia treatment elevated lincRNA-p21 expression SMMC7721 hepatoma U251MG glioma cells. Knockdown lincRNA-p21 induced G2/M phase arrest, promoted apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation motility, reduced autophagy HIF-1/Akt/mTOR/P70S6K pathway hypoxic tumor cells. results delineated novel mechanism lincRNA-p21 enhancing hypoxic tumor cell radiosensitivity, might provide valuable targets radiation therapy solid tumors, hepatoma glioma.
