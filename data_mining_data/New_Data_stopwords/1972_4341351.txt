 rate coefficient (22)Na release previously labeled human erythrocytes determined presence 0.1-10 mM sodium fluoride (F). oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) level end 2 hr incubation tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-Ringer medium also measured. parameters decreased proportionately F concentration raised. F-induced changes immediate reversed 10 mM pyruvate. decrease NAD(+) concentration following enolase inhibition F attributed diminished rate formation reaction catalyzed lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) undiminished continued utilization reaction catalyzed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). postulated NAD(+) lowering limited GAPDH step, resulting proportionate decreases rates phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) Na,K-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase), reaction sequence thought link glycolysis active Na extrusion. Adding pyruvate F increased NAD(+) production LDH step, thus reactivating GAPDH, PGK, Na,K-ATPase leading observed restoration (22)Na release. results suggest, therefore, F inhibits active Na transport intact human erythrocytes indirectly lowering NAD(+), although, direct inhibition Na,K-ATPase F may possibly occur simultaneously.
