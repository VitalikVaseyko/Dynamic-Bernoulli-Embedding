 Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein 1 (PTBP1) essential RNA-binding protein regulates diverse biological events regulating alternative splice mRNA. PTBP1 induces cancer-promoting splice variants related tumorigenesis several cancers. However, expression patterns biological mechanisms PTBP1 clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) unclear. investigated PTBP1 expression 533 ccRCC patients TCGA 30 ccRCC patients immunohistochemistry, found PTBP1 expression levels significantly increased ccRCC tissues high PTBP1 expression closely correlated advanced tumor stage, AJCC stage poor prognosis. Cell biological assays siRNA-mediated knockdown lentivirus vector-mediated over-expression demonstrated PTBP1 promoted proliferation, migration invasion ccRCC cells vitro. Furthermore, PTBP1 increased transformation pyruvate kinase muscle 1 (PKM1) PKM2. Knockdown PKM2 mainly abolished PTBP1-induced proliferation, migration invasion ccRCC cells vitro. conclusion, study indicates PTBP1 plays tumorigenic role ccRCC mediating PKM2 alternative splicing may potential prognostic marker promising target treatment ccRCC.
