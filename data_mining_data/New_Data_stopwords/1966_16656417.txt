 requirements transfer (14)C-phenylalanine yeast soluble ribonucleic acid protein vitro rice (Oryza sativa L. var. Bluebonnet) ribosomes investigated. absolute requirement polyuridylic acid, 2-mercaptoethanol, guanosine triphosphate, magnesium, potassium ammonium ions ribosomes demonstrated. Ribosomes washed 0.5% sodium deoxycholate also required presence rice supernatant. optimum concentration magnesium ion reaction approximately 7 mm, 60 mm either ammonium potassium ion gave maximum transfer phenylalanine heterologous system. optimum concentration guanosine triphosphate required varied presence absence phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase generating system. Without system, optimum concentration 1.5 mm, presence optimum approximately 0.1 mm.
