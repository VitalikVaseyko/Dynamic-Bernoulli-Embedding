 regulation insulin carbohydrates gene expression three key enzymes involved glucose metabolism studied liver Wistar fatty rat, model obese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. high glucose fructose diet, insulin administration caused similar magnitude increase level L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA liver Wistar fatty rats lean littermates. However, induction glucokinase mRNA repression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA dietary glucose insulin impaired fatty rats, whereas fructose caused similar decrease phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA types rats. results indicate regulation gene expression glucokinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, L-type pyruvate kinase, insulin impaired liver Wistar fatty rat.
