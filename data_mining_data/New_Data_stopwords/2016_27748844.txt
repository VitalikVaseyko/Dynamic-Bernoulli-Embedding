 Acceleration glycolysis characteristic neoplasia. Previous studies shown metabolic shift occurs many tumors correlates negative prognosis. present study aimed investigate glycolytic profile thyroid carcinoma cell lines. investigated glycolytic oxidative parameters two thyroid carcinoma papillary cell lines (BCPAP TPC1) non-tumor cell line NTHY-ori. carcinoma cell lines showed higher rates glycolysis efficiency, compared NTHY-ori, assessed higher rate glucose consumption lactate production. BCPAP cell line presented higher rates growth, well elevated intracellular ATP levels, compared TPC1 NTHY-ori cells. found glycolysis activities pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) regulatory enzymes significantly different among carcinoma cell lines, particularly mitochondrial hexokinase (HK) activity higher BCPAP cells TPC1 cell line showed balanced distribution HK activity cytoplasmic mitochondrial subcellular localizations. However, TPC1 higher levels glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, suggesting PPP elevated cell type. Using high resolution respirometry, observed Warburg effect present BCPAP TPC1 cells, characterized low oxygen consumption high reactive oxygen species production. Overall, results indicate thyroid papillary carcinoma cell lines showed glycolytic profile. note, BCPAP cells presented relevant differences cell metabolism compared TPC1 cells, mainly related higher mitochondrial-associated HK activity.
