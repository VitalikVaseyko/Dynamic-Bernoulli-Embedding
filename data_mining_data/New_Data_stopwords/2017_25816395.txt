 Diabetes mellitus (DM) chronic metabolic disorder characterized hyperglycemia due abnormalities either insulin secretion action. range vanadium complexes synthesized demonstrated effective lowering hyperglycemia. Thiamine administration also reported prevent deterioration fasting glucose insulin levels, improve glucose tolerance hyperglycemic patients. study conducted evaluate ionic vanadyl(II) thiamine hydrochloride complex (VC) new anti-diabetic candidate. new complex characterized infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), electronic spectra, magnetic susceptibility, electron spin resonance (ESR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). anti-diabetic effect VC investigated comparison vanadium sulfate streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Treatment diabetic rats VC versus vanadyl sulfate showed potent effect reducing serum glucose cholesterol close normal levels. VC suppressed diabetes-induced upregulation hepatic glucose transporter (GLUT)-2, Phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) significantly vanadyl sulfate. Either vanadyl sulfate VC restored hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factor-1c (SREBP-1c) muscle hexokinase (HK) mRNA expression downregulated diabetic group. Pyruvate kinase (PK) mRNA expression restored significantly VC-treated vanadyl sulfate-treated diabetic rats. results indicate newly synthesized VC could effective anti-diabetic candidate anti-diabetic activity ionic vanadium enhanced modified organic ligand, thiamin. results also suggest VC achieves effect likely modulating transcription energy metabolizing enzymes.
