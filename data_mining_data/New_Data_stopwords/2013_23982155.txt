 LKB1 downstream targets AMP-activated protein kinase family important regulators many aspects skeletal muscle cell function, including control mitochondrial content capillarity. LKB1 deficiency skeletal cardiac muscle (mLKB1-KO) greatly impairs exercise capacity. However, cardiac dysfunction genetic model prevents clear assessment role skeletal muscle LKB1 observed effects. purposes determine whether skeletal muscle-specific knockout LKB1 (skmLKB1-KO) decreases exercise capacity mitochondrial protein content, impairs accretion mitochondrial proteins exercise training, attenuates improvement running performance exercise training. found treadmill voluntary wheel running capacity reduced skmLKB1-KO vs. control (CON) mice. Citrate synthase activity, succinate dehydrogenase activity, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase content lower KO vs. CON muscles. Three weeks treadmill training resulted significantly increased treadmill running performance CON skmLKB1-KO mice. Citrate synthase activity increased significantly training genotypes, protein content activity components mitochondrial electron transport chain increased CON mice. Capillarity VEGF protein lower skmLKB1-KO vs. CON muscles, VEGF increased training skmLKB1-KO. Three hours acute bout muscle contractions, PGC-1alpha, cytochrome c, VEGF gene expression increased CON skmLKB1-KO muscles. findings indicate skeletal muscle LKB1 required accretion mitochondrial proteins early exercise capacity improvements exercise training.
