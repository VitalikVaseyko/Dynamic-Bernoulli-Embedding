 sensitivity glucose production L-lactate isolated liver cells starved rats inhibition alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate studied. small percentage maximal rate gluconeogenesis insensitive inhibition alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, evidence presented show due pyruvate entry mitochondria alanine. subtraction rate, Dixon plots reciprocal rate gluconeogenesis inhibitor concentration linear absence presence glucagon, phenylephrine valinomycin, stimulated gluconeogenesis 30-50%. Pyruvate kinase activity decreased glucagon, phenylephrine valinomycin. Inhibition gluconeogenesis quinolinate (inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) monochloroacetate (probably inhibiting pyruvate carboxylation) caused significant deviation linearity Dixon plot obtained alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate. Amytal, however, inhibited gluconeogenesis without affecting linearity plot. data, coupled computer simulation study, suggest pyruvate transport may control gluconeogenesis L-lactate hormones may stimulate process effect respiratory chain. additional role pyruvate kinase pyruvate carboxylase quite compatible data presented.
