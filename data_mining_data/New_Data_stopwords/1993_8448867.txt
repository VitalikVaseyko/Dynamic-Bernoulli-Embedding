 report new potentiometric method determining pyruvate kinase (PK). Enzymatic activity measured monitoring change pH produced reaction buffer International Committee Standardization Haematology (ICSH) standardized assay conditions, lactate dehydrogenase reaction automatically subtracted measuring cycle. analysis, performed 37 degrees C, requires 10-microL sample (isolated erythrocytes whole blood) completed 2.5 min. intra-assay CV < 4% (PK 3 35 U/g Hb); interassay CV 4.0% (PK 15 U/g Hb); results linear 3 30 U/g Hb. good correlation ICSH reference method (x) found: = 1.011x - 0.05; n = 32; r = 0.9939; Sylx = 0.75 (units: U/g Hb). reference intervals PK activity isolated erythrocytes (RBC-PK) estimated 89 normal subjects. found women possess higher RBC-PK men (P < 0.0001) biological variability (CVb) RBC-PK 13.5%. Applications proposed method hematological routine reported.
