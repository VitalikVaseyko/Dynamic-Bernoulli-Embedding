 studied effects insulin glucagon energy carbohydrate metabolism rat hepatocytes primary culture. aim study elucidate mechanism synergistic action insulin glucagon evaluate combined effects hormones liver injury. Insulin increased level adenosine triphosphate hepatocytes presence glucagon. Insulin increased activities glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) type L glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49). Glucagon antagonistic effect increases. Glucagon increased activity glucose 6-phosphate (EC 3.1.3.9) (G6Pase) presence absence insulin, insulin effects levels G6Pase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) presence absence glucagon. Metabolite analysis cultured hepatocytes indicated insulin glucagon antagonistic effects glycolytic activity hepatocytes. combined effects insulin glucagon may partially explain preventive effects hormones liver injury.
