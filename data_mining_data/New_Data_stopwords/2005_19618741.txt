 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB) family bifunctional enzymes responsible maintaining cellular levels fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, powerful allosteric activator glycolysis. report overexpression PFKFB-1, -2, -3 -4 mRNA human lung cancers compared corresponding normal tissues counterparts well PFKFB-4 -3 protein levels. lung carcinoma cell line A549, conditions normal oxygen tension, also shown increased transcript levels PFKFB-2, -3 -4 compared normal tissues. Moreover, hypoxia highly induced expression PFKFB-2, PFKFB-3 especially PFKFB-4 isozymes highly induced lung carcinoma cells. Thus, results' clearly demonstrated overexpression PFKFB gene family isozymes lung cancers possible role Warburg effect.
