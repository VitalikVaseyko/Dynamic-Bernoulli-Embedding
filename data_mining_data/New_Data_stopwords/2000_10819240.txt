 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) highly expressed pancreatic islets associated insulin secretion vesicles. suppression CaMK II disturbs insulin secretion insulin gene expression. four isoforms CaMK II, alpha delta, expressed different genes mammals. aim identify isoforms CaMK II expressed human beta cells molecular cloning human insulinoma cDNA library assess distribution humans. METHODS: previously unknown complete coding sequences human CaMK IIbeta kinase domain CaMK IIdelta cloned human insulinoma cDNA library. Quantitative determination CaMK II isoform mRNA carried several tissues beta cells purified fluorescence activated cell sorting compared housekeeping enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. RESULTS: found CaMK IIbeta occurred three splice variants highly expressed endocrine tissues adrenals, pituitary beta cells. Liver showed moderate expression adipose tissue lymphocytes low levels CaMK IIbeta-mRNA. human beta cells CaMK IIbeta delta expressed equally pyruvate dehydrogenase whereas tenfold lower expression CaMK IIgamma expression CaMK IIalpha found. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Although CaMK IIdelta ubiquitously expressed, CaMK IIbeta shows preferential expression neuroendocrine tissues. comparison expression key regulatory enzyme glucose oxidation, pyruvate dehydrogenase, two four CaM kinases investigated expressed equally high levels, supports important role beta-cell physiology. results provide basis exploring pathophysiological relevance CaMK IIbeta human diabetes.
