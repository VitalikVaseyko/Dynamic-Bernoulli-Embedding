 two forms pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) present Escherichia coli purified cultures crystallized. modified procedure purification type pyruvate kinase described. Molecular weight, subunit structure, amino acid composition, NH2-terminal amino acid, maps tryptic peptides conditions crystallization determined two forms. comparison data shows two forms different proteins, tetramer identical subunits.
