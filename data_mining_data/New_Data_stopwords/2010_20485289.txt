 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells highly dependent glycolysis. aim determine switching metabolism glycolysis towards mitochondrial respiration would reduce growth preferentially colorectal cancer cells normal cells, examine underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Representative colorectal cancer non-cancerous cell lines treated dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. RESULTS: Dichloroacetate (20 mM) reduce growth non-cancerous cells caused significant decrease cancer cell proliferation (P=0.009), associated apoptosis G(2) phase cell-cycle arrest. largest apoptotic effect evident metastatic LoVo cells, DCA induced ten-fold increase apoptotic cell counts 48 h. striking G(2) arrest evident well-differentiated HT29 cells, DCA caused eight-fold increase cells G(2) phase 48 h. Dichloroacetate reduced lactate levels growth media induced dephosphorylation E1alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex cell lines, intrinsic mitochondrial membrane potential reduced cancer cells (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibition attenuates glycolysis facilitates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading reduced growth colorectal cancer cells non-cancerous cells.
