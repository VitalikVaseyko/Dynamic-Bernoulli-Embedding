 Glutaminase C key metabolic enzyme, unregulated many cancer systems believed play central role Warburg effect, whereby cancer cells undergo changes altered metabolic profile. long-standing hypothesis links enzymatic activity protein oligomeric state, hence study solution behavior general oligomer state particular glutaminase C important understanding mechanism protein activation inhibition. report, extensively investigated correlation enzyme concentration phosphate level, using high-throughput microfluidic-mixing chip SAXS data collection, confirm oligomeric state correlates activity. in-depth solution behavior analysis reveals structural behavior flexible regions protein dimeric, tetrameric octameric state investigates C-terminal influence enzyme solution behavior. data enable SAXS-based rigid body modeling full-length tetramer states, thereby presenting first ever experimentally derived structural model mitochondrial glutaminase C including N- C-termini enzyme.
