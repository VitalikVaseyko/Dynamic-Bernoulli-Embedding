 Cathepsins B rabbit liver lysosomes separated chromatography Ultrogel AcA34 low ionic strength purified homogeneity, catalytic molecular properties compared. Cathepsin relatively inactive synthetic peptide substrates. Thus, hydrolyzed benzoyl arginine naphthylamide one-fifth rate observed cathepsin B, activity detected Gly-Phe naphthylamide relatively good substrate cathepsin B. hand, cathepsin exhibited preference protein substrates. active cathepsin B catalyzing inactivation following enzymes: rabbit muscle liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases, rabbit liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase pyruvate kinase, yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. glucagon substrate, enzymes showed similar peptidyl dipeptidase activities minor differences peptide bond specificity. Cathepsins B similar size, apparent molecular weights 30,200 cathepsin 28,800 cathepsin B, amino acid composition carbohydrate content. contains approximately 2-3 equivalents/mol glucosamine, 3 equivalents/mol mannose, fucose galactosamine. also show similar microheterogeneity sodium dodecylsulfate-gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing; microheterogeneity probably related differences glycosylation. Extensive homology primary structure two proteins indicated similar patterns peptides formed digestion trypsin.
