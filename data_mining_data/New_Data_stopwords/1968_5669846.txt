 1. intracellular distribution hexokinase activity studied mucosa rat guinea-pig small intestine. rat 60% guinea pig 45% hexokinase activity homogenates recovered total particulate fraction contained 5-17% homogenate activity hexose phosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase overall glycolysis (formation lactate glucose). 2. Fractionation homogenates guineapig small intestine showed particulate hexokinase activity chiefly mitochondrial fraction small proportion nuclei plus brush-border fraction. 3. chromatography particle-free supernatants DEAE-cellulose, hexokinase types II determined quantitatively. evidence obtained presence hexokinase type III glucokinase. preparations guinea pigs, hexokinase types II amounted 69% 31% respectively eluted activity; corresponding values preparations rats 5.8% 94.2%. 4. Total specific hexokinase activities decreased significantly homogenates particle-free supernatants prepared intestinal mucosa rats starved 36hr. increased re-feeding. decrease hexokinase activity particle-free supernatant starved rats chiefly due decrease type II enzyme.
