 present study investigated effect ovariectomy parameters energy metabolism, namely Na(+),K(+)-ATPase pyruvate kinase activities, well mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes activities succinate dehydrogenase, complex II cytochrome c oxidase rat striatum. influence soy diet rich isoflavones effects elicited ovariectomy enzyme activities also evaluated. Female adult Wistar rats assigned one following groups: sham (submitted surgery without removal ovaries) ovariectomized. Seven days surgery animals fed 30 days special diet soy protein standard diet casein (control). Rats sacrificed treatment striatum dissected. Results showed rats subjected ovariectomy presented significant increase Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, succinate dehydrogenase complex II activities. Treatment isoflavones-rich soy diet able reverse increase Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, effective reversing changes caused ovariectomy succinate dehydrogenase complex II activities. Since ovariectomy mimics postmenopausal changes, findings suggest dysfunction brain energy metabolism may related neurological symptoms observed postmenopausal women.
