 BACKGROUND: Ethyl pyruvate (EP) shown attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Induction heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) suppression inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression provide cytoprotection lung vascular injury. aim study evaluate whether beneficial effect EP lung inflammation related HO-1 induction rat model LPS-induced ALI. MATERIALS METHODS: Rats administered LPS (30 mg/kg) intravenous infusion 4 h induce ALI. EP (20, 40, 60 mg/kg/4 h i.v. infusion) vehicle given 1 h LPS initiation. RESULTS: EP 40 60 mg/kg attenuated plasma levels TNF-alpha IL-6 caused LPS, increased IL-10 levels compared LPS group. 6 h LPS initiation, iNOS protein expression lungs plasma metabolite levels markedly increased, reduced EP 60 mg/kg. LPS caused significant HO-1 induction, whereas administration EP 60 mg/kg significantly induced higher HO-1 expression compared LPS group. beneficial effects EP cytokines iNOS expression reversed HO-1 inhibitor SnPP. EP significantly suppressed phosphorylated p38 MAPK increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein levels lung tissue. edema infiltration neutrophils lungs reduced EP. CONCLUSION: EP reduced LPS-induced ALI, may mediated induction HO-1. underlying mechanisms associated suppression p38 MAPK increase ERK1/2 signaling pathway activation.
