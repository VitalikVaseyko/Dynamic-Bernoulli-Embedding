 investigate effects ischemia renal metabolites, sequential slices renal cortex removed 5 min renal artery occlusion 5 min release occlusion. ATP concentrations rapidly fell ischemia rose postischemic period. Based rate decline ATP concentrations, rate ATP production estimated 0.5 mumol ATP/g/min. considerably less rate ATP production estimated renal O2 consumption. ischemia, AMP concentrations rose, confirming activity adenylate kinase. control lactate/pyruvate ratio suggested dog kidney cytosol reduced cytosol rat liver kidney. ischemia, lactate concentrations lactate/pyruvate ratio dog renal cortex increased expected, fell restoration blood flow. beta-Hydroxybutyrate concentrations considerably lower previously reported rat liver kidney. beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio measurable ischemia. However, mitochondrial redox state, calculated glutamate/alpha-ketoglutarate . NH+4 ratio, similar previous reports ratio appropriately changed ischemic post-ischemic period.
