 Fasting accompanied decrease collagen biosynthesis. mechanism phenomenon involves inhibition prolidase activity, enzyme plays key role upregulation collagen metabolism. mechanism fasting-induced inhibition prolidase activity known. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) known strong inhibitor prolidase activity. exerts effect inhibition enzyme phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated prolidase inactive. One may expect fasting-associated increase posphoenolpyruvate content animal tissues may factor inactivates prolidase makes inactive collagen biosynthesis. measured levels phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, pyruvate kinase skin control fasted rats correlated parameters prolidase expression, prolidase activity collagen biosynthesis tissue. Significant increase PEP concentration (about 30%) found skin fasted rats. time prolidase activity collagen biosynthesis decreased 50% 30%, respectively, compared controls. known phosphoenolpyruvate converted pyruvate action pyruvate kinase. Since fasting significantly decreases activity enzyme, one may suggest accumulation PEP caused reduced utilisation metabolite. demonstrated Western immunoblot analysis decrease prolidase activity accompanied decrease amount enzyme protein. Instead, decrease enzyme phosphorylation observed. reduction phosphorylation seems responsible decrease prolidase activity. data suggest fasting-evoked accumulation PEP reduces activity prolidase, providing mechanism inhibition collagen biosynthesis skin.
