 context climate change present work aimed illustrate whether energetic metabolic pattern mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis affected increase temperature seawater. Moreover examined whether outbreak Marteilia sp. infestation result increase sea water temperature impair energetic balance mussels. M. galloprovincialis acclimated 18 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 26 degrees C 28 degrees C 30 days energetic pattern tissues estimated determining factor Scope Growth (SFG), metabolic pattern mussels estimated determining activities pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). decrease PK activity decrease ratio PK/PEPCK indicated activation anaerobic component metabolism acclimation mussels temperature 24 degrees C. temperatures higher 24 degrees C values SFG turned negative probably associated significant reduction clearance rate. Compared non infected mussels, SFG values infected mussels significantly lower (P<0.05). differences attributed higher filtration rate lower absorption efficiency detected infected mussels. Also degree SFG reduction dependent intensity levels infection Marteilia sp.
