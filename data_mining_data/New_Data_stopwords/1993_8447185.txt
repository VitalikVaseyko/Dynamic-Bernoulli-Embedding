 Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) potent stimulator 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), key enzyme glycolysis. studied whether regulator involved changes glycolysis induced experimentally isolated working rat heart. glycolytic flux assessed rate detritiation [2-3H]- [3-3H]glucose, lactate output changes glycogen content. 20-40% increase Fru-2,6-P2 content observed glycolysis stimulated increasing either workload (by increasing preload afterload) concentration glucose (from 2 11 mM), adding 7 microM insulin. Anoxia decreased external work developed heart, stimulated glycolysis activating glycogenolysis, increase Fru-2,6-P2. increase Fru-2,6-P2 content observed insulin, high workload glucose load might related stimulation glucose transport, and/or activation 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2), enzyme responsible synthesis Fru-2,6-P2. Addition perfusate 0.5 10 mM lactate, preferred substrate heart, pyruvate 10:1 ratio, induced dose-dependent inhibition glycolytic flux PFK-1, maximal inhibition 75% 5 mM lactate. accumulation hexose 6-phosphates without change fructose 1,6-bisphosphate triose-phosphates concentrations confirmed inhibition glycolysis mainly exerted PFK-1. inhibition resulted doubling citrate concentration, inhibitor, 75% decrease Fru-2,6-P2. Despite inhibition glycolysis, glucose phosphorylation barely affected lactate, suggesting change glucose metabolism. Indeed, lactate induced dose-dependent increase glycogen content, doubled 5 mM lactate, reaching level obtained addition 7 microM insulin. Increased glycogen synthesis explained accumulation UDP glucose, substrate, glucose 6-phosphate, stimulator glycogen synthase. conclude that, aerobiosis, Fru-2,6-P2 regarded glycolytic signal switched glucose availability, workload insulin, switched availability alternative oxidative substrates lactate. latter also controls glucose metabolism diverting glucose glycolysis glycogen synthesis.
