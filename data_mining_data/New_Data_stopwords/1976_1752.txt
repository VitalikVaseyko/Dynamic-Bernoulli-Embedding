 Highly purified platelet glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; D-glucose-6-phosphate:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) modified isoelectric point molecular specific activity extracts leukemic granulocytes. "G6PD modifying factors" relatively small molecules (molecular weight slightly 5000), thermostable, dialyzable, ultrafilterable. molecules destroyed various endo- exopeptidases serine enzymes present crude extracts leukocytes commercial preparations ribonuclease. alterations platelet G6PD due "G6PD modifying factors" stable reversible dialysis chromatography. leukemic extracts able modify G6PD also modify electrophoretic mobility (or) enzymatic activity purified leukocyte pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucosephosphate isomerase. chemical nature modifications relationships post-translational modifications occur leukemic normal cells discussed.
