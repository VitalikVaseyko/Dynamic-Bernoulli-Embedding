 One major effects fluoride oral bacteria reduction acid tolerance, presumably also cariogenicity. reduction appears involve transport protons across cell membrane weak acid HF dissipate pH gradient, also direct inhibition F1F0, proton-translocating ATPases organisms, especially Streptococcus mutans. direct inhibition fluoride found dependent aluminum. dependence aluminum indicated protection fluoride inhibition afforded Al-chelator deferoxamine loss protection addition umolar levels Al3+, inhibitory enzyme absence fluoride. F1 form enzyme dissociated cell membrane previously found resistant fluoride comparison F1F0 membrane-associated form. However, difference appeared depend less aluminum F1 preparation sensitivity F1 enzyme fluoride could increased addition umolar levels Al3+. effects Al fluoride inhibition apparent enzyme activity assayed terms phosphate release ATP ATP-regenerating system containing phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, NADH lactic dehydrogenase. Also, Be2+ metal cations, e.g. Co2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2, Sn2+, Zn2+, served sensitize enzyme fluoride inhibition. differences sensitivities enzymes isolated various oral bacteria found previously appeared also related differences levels Al.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
