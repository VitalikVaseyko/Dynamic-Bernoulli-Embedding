 Cancer cells exhibit altered glucose metabolism, termed Warburg effect, described increased uptake glucose conversion glucose lactate cancer cells adequate oxygen tension. Recent genetic metabolic analyses provided insights molecular mechanisms genes involved Warburg effect tumorigenesis. aim review discuss significant molecular insights clinical impacts Warburg effect oncogenic alterations overexpression transcriptional factors (c-Myc hypoxia-inducible factor), metabolite transporters (glucose transporters) glycolytic enzymes (hexokinases 2, pyruvate kinase M2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 1, lactate dehydrogenase A). Overexpression transcriptional factors, metabolite transporters glycolytic enzymes associated poor prognosis may associated chemoradiotherapy resistance multiple gastrointestinal cancer cell types. Novel small molecules targeting enzymes transporters exert anti-proliferative effects. Glycolytic enzymes metabolite transporters may significant biomarkers predicting cancer prognosis may therapeutic targets gastrointestinal cancer.
