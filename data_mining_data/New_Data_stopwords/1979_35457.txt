 effects pH, season, environmental experimental temperatures activities kinetic parameters D-lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase arginine kinase foot pulmonate snail Helix pomatia analyzed. phosphate Tris buffers D-lactate dehydrogenase enzyme acid maximum, arginine kinase alkaline, whilst pyruvate kinase occupied intermediate position. Pyruvate kinase activity, measured 20 degrees C, positively correlated environmental temperature moment collecting animal, whereas neither arginine kinase D-lactate dehydrogenase showed relationship. seasonal study based approximately 100 specimens established arginine kinase activity remained throughout year. Pyruvate kinase activity slightly lower, D-lactate dehydrogenase activity significantly higher, winter summer animals. Snails subjected spring short warm-up period enzyme extraction showed extreme variability extraordinarily high values pyruvate kinase activity, suggesting either season elevated temperature may immediate effect activity enzyme. Individual variability three enzymes ranges 300 400%. activities pyruvate kinase D-lactate dehydrogenase strongly correlated summer, forming "constant-proportion-group", whereas winter, D-lactate dehydrogenase activity increasing pyruvate kinase activity decreasing two enzymes become "uncoupled". Km value pyruvate kinase independent experimental temperature 10 25 degrees C, whereas D-lactate dehydrogenase arginine kinase increases three-fold within range. Thus temperature relationship single enzymic reaction cannot used arguemnt occurrence temperature compensation whole animal metabolism. possibility modulation enzyme activity environmental temperature discussed.
