 previous studies shown methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oate (CDDO-Me), oleanane synthetic triterpenoid induces apoptosis prostate cancer cells inhibiting Akt/NF-kappaB/mTOR signaling cascade; however, mechanism CDDO-Me inhibits Akt/NF-kappaB/mTOR signaling remained undetermined. Present studies show Akt plays critical role response prostate cancer cells CDDO-Me. Silencing Akt sensitized PC-3 cells CDDO-Me, whereas overexpression rendered resistant CDDO-Me. Evaluation effect CDDO-Me Akt lies upstream NF-kappaB mTOR showed CDDO-Me directly inhibits Akt kinase activity cell-free kinase activity assay vivo without modulating activity PDK1, upstream kinase phosphorylates activates Akt. inhibition Akt activity resulted inhibition phosphorylation/inactivation proapoptotic procaspase-9, Bad Foxo3a. Further, inhibition p-Akt CDDO-Me attributable increase activity protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) PH domain/leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase1 (PHLPP1) dephosphorylate p-Akt. findings show Akt direct target CDDO-Me Akt/NF-kappaB/mTOR prosurvival signaling axis.
