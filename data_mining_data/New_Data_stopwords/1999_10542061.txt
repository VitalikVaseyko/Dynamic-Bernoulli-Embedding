 effect hydrostatic pressure stability tetrameric rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase investigated enzyme activity measurements, size-exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism fluorescence spectroscopies. nonreducing conditions, enzyme activity irreversibly inhibited increasing pressure completely abolished 350 MPa. Inhibition dependent concentration pyruvate kinase, indicating related pressure-induced subunit dissociation. Size-exclusion chromatography pressurized samples confirmed decrease proportion tetramers increase monomers relative native samples. Addition dithiothreitol immediately following pressure release led full recovery enzyme activity native tetramers. Furthermore, irreversible inhibition pyruvate kinase observed pressure treatment carried presence dithiothreitol. data suggest pressure-dissociated monomers undergo conformational changes leading oxidation sulfhydryl groups, prevents correct refolding native tetramers decompression. conformational changes relatively subtle, indicated lack significant changes far-UV circular dichroism intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra previously pressurized samples. effects various physiological ligands pressure stability pyruvate kinase also investigated. slight protection inhibition observed simultaneous presence K+, Mg2+ ADP. phosphoenolpyruvate allosteric inhibitor, phenylalanine, caused marked stabilization pressure, suggesting significant energy coupling binding ligands stabilization tetramer.
