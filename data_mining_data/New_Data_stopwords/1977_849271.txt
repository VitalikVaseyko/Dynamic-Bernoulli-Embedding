 "L"-type pyruvate kinase rabbit liver catalyse exchange phosphoenol[1-14C]pyruvate pyruvate either pH 8.5 6.2. Spectrophotometric experiments pH 8.5 6;2 gel-filtration experiments [32P]phosphoenolpyruvate pH 8,5 also fail demonstrate phosphoenzyme formation. concluded unlikely enzyme phosphoenzyme mechanism.
