 host response infection Coxiella burneti investigated. Infectedyolk sacs harvested embryonated eggs assayed glycolytic activity. Assays glycolytic enzymes included glucose isomerase, aldolase, phosphofructokinase,fructose-1,6-diphoshatase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase. significant differences enzymatic activity normal infected tissues 12th day observed. 13th day 16thday, glycolytic activity normal tissues decreased. Glycolytic activity infected tissues decrease, showed gradual increase time period. Embryos infected eggs demonstrated gradual decrease total weight fromthe 12th day death occurred 16th day.
