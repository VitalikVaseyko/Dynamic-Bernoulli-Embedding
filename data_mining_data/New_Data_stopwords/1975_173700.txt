 Kinetic analysis demonstrated irreversible inhibition nucleoside diphosphate kinase Escherichia coli desdanine proceeds via reversible Enzyme-Inhibitor complex. known pyruvate kinase E. coli becomes inactive upon prolonged dialysis absence reducing reagent, dithiothreitol inactive enzyme reactivated dithiothretiol added. Desdanine inhibits reactivation process. effect discussed relation inhibition relation inhibition growth E. coli desdanine anaerobic conditions. Pyruvate kinase E. coli changes intracellular quantity kinetic characteristics depending growth conditions, aerobic anaerobic. enzyme shows broad specificity nucleside diphosphates, especially presence AMP, thus resembles closely nucleoside diphosphate kinase. vivo role pyruvate kinase supplying nucleoside triphosphates anaerobic conditions discussed.
