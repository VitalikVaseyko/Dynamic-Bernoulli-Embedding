 fraction pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) active form reduced activities dedicated PD kinase isozymes (PDK1, PDK2, PDK3 PDK4). Via binding inner lipoyl domain (L2) dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2 60mer), PDK rapidly access E2-bound PD substrate. E2-enhanced activity widely distributed PDK2 limited dissociation ADP C-terminal catalytic domain, slowed pyruvate binding N-terminal regulatory (R) domain. Via reverse PDC reaction, NADH acetyl-CoA reductively acetylate lipoyl group L2, binds R domain stimulates PDK2 activity speeding ADP dissociation. Activation PDC synthetic PDK inhibitors binding pyruvate lipoyl binding sites decreased damage heart ischemia lowered blood glucose insulin-resistant animals. PDC activation also triggers apoptosis cancer cells selectively convert glucose lactate.
