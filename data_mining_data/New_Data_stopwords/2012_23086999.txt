 Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) plays important role growth metabolic reprogramming cancer cells stress conditions. Here, report SAICAR (succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribose-5'-phosphate, intermediate de novo purine nucleotide synthesis pathway) specifically stimulates PKM2. Upon glucose starvation, cellular SAICAR concentration increased oscillatory manner stimulated PKM2 activity cancer cells. Changes SAICAR amounts cancer cells altered cellular energy level, glucose uptake, lactate production. SAICAR-PKM2 interaction also promoted cancer cell survival glucose-limited conditions. SAICAR accumulation observed normal adult epithelial cells lung fibroblasts, regardless glucose conditions. allosteric regulation may explain cancer cells coordinate different metabolic pathways optimize growth nutrient-limited conditions commonly observed tumor microenvironment.
