 Metabolic alterations accompany parasitism invertebrate animals play important role parasite development. Employing 13C NMR, study examined pyruvate cycling (2-(13)C)pyruvate lepidopteran insect Manduca sexta, effects parasitism hymenopteran Cotesia congregata gluconeogenic formation trehalose, haemolymph blood sugar insects. Larvae maintained semi-synthetic sucrose-free diet, diet sucrose 8.5 g/l. Pyruvate cycling evident 13C enrichment C3 alanine, derived following carboxylation oxaloacetate, similar parasitized normal insects regardless diet. Trehalose formed following de novo synthesis glucose, net synthesis estimated 13C distribution trehalose alanine. 13C-enrichment ratio [2trehalose C6/alanine C3] indicator level gluconeogenesis relative glycolysis, enrichments derived (2-(13)C)pyruvate manner. ratio greater unity insects, regardless diet, significantly greater parasitized larvae, demonstrating enhanced level gluconeogenesis. confirmed analysis 13C distribution trehalose glutamine derived (3-(13)C)alanine. Despite enhanced de novo trehalose formation parasitized insects, haemolymph sugar level similar normal larvae. haemolymph trehalose regulates dietary carbohydrate intake, gluconeogenesis, results suggest accelerated induction gluconeogenesis adaptive response parasitism provides increased carbohydrate parasite growth simultaneously maintains nutrient intake.
