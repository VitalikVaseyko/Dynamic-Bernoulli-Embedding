 Beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta 1,4-GT) Golgi-resident, type II membrane-bound glycoprotein functions coordinate biosynthesis complex oligosaccharides. Additionally, beta 1,4-GT localized cell surface variety cell types tissues proposed function intercellular recognition and/or adhesion. Thus beta 1,4-GT appropriate molecule used analyzing molecular basis retention membrane-bound enzyme Golgi complex subsequent alternative transport cell surface. Previously shown gene bovine murine beta 1,4-GT unusual specifies short (SGT) long (LGT) form enzyme (Russo, R. N., Shaper, N. L., Shaper, J. H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3324-3331). difference two related forms primary structure cytoplasmic domains, LGT NH2-terminal extension 13 amino acids. study, tested hypothesis LGT SGT differentially retained Golgi directed cell surface. LGT, SGT chimeric proteins, containing NH2-terminal cytoplasmic transmembrane domain SGT LGT fused cytoplasmic protein pyruvate kinase, stably expressed Chinese hamster ovary cells. Proteins expressed construct localized immunofluorescence staining exclusively perinuclear region, identified Golgi co-localization wheat germ agglutinin. Furthermore, subcellular distribution SGT LGT restricted trans-Golgi compartment assessed EM immunoelectron microscopy. data suggest forms beta 1,4-GT resident trans-Golgi proteins NH2-terminal segment containing cytoplasmic transmembrane domains SGT (39 amino acids) LGT (52 amino acids) sufficient Golgi retention.
