 Regulatory sequences involved transcriptional induction rat S14 gene response increased glucose metabolism hepatocyte investigated compared liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene. carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) S14 gene found consist two motifs related consensus binding site c-myc family transcription factors, CACGTG. two motifs separated five base pairs, similar arrangement found L-PK ChoRE. natural context, S14 ChoRE requires novel accessory factor support full response glucose. factor, well factor hepatic nuclear factor-4, capable binding L-PK gene enhance carbohydrate regulation. need accessory factor supporting glucose response overcome two ways. First, multimers ChoREs either L-PK S14 genes function independently support glucose response. Second, mutations S14 ChoRE create perfect match consensus CACGTG motif locus longer require accessory factor site. spacing two CACGTG motifs, nature bases within spacer, critical control. observations suggest carbohydrate responsive factor binds motifs highly specific spatial orientation confer response increased carbohydrate metabolism.
