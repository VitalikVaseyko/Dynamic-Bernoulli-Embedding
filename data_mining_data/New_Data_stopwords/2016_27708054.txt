 Aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) metabolic hallmark activated cells implicated augmenting effector cell responses, including expression proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), via 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)-mediated mechanisms. Here, show lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) induced activated cells support aerobic glycolysis promotes IFN-gamma expression independently 3'UTR. Instead, LDHA maintains high concentrations acetyl-coenzyme enhance histone acetylation transcription Ifng Ablation LDHA cells protects mice immunopathology triggered excessive IFN-gamma expression deficiency regulatory cells. findings reveal epigenetic mechanism aerobic glycolysis promotes effector cell differentiation suggest LDHA may targeted therapeutically autoinflammatory diseases.
