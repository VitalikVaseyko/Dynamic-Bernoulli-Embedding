 Regional cerebral ischemia produced common carotid artery occlusion gerbils middle cerebral artery occlusion dogs, cats, squirrel monkeys. Anesthesia induced either pentobarbital halothane maintained two three hours vessel occlusion. acute studies, effect regional cerebral ischemia cerebral concentrations ATP, phosphocreatine, lactate, pyruvate determined end period gerbils, cats, squirrel monkeys. chronic studies, degree neurological deficit size cerebral infarction determined 48 hours two-hour three-hour period vessel occlusion cats squirrel monkeys permanent occlusion dogs. gerbils, dogs, cats, differences metabolis, functional, pathological effects anesthesia pentobarbital halothane. However, squirrel monkey, acute studies metabolic alterations significantly less pentobarbital, chronic studies frequency magnitude functional deficits cerebral infarction significantly less. conclude pentobarbital provide degree protection regional cerebral ischemia effects consistently demonstrable primates. nonprimates, assume variability collateral circulation renders demonstration significant differences difficult impossible.
