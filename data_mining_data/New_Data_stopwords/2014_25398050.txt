 simultaneously maintaining homeostasis reducing harm host, immune system equipped eliminate tumors pathogenic microorganisms. Bifurcated cell-mediated humoral immunity, adaptive immune system requires series complex coordinated signals drive proliferation differentiation appropriate subsets. include signals modulate cellular metabolism. first published 1920s, "the Warburg effect" used describe phenomenon cancer cells relied aerobic glycolysis meet biosynthetic demands. Despite early observations Warburg colleagues, targeting cancer cell metabolism therapeutic purposes still remains theoretical. Notably, many cells exhibit Warburg metabolism cancer cells therapeutic benefit targeting metabolic pathways since reexamined. Emerging evidence suggests specific metabolic alterations associated cells may ancillary subset differentiation influential inflammatory response. Thus, cell lymphocyte activation leads skewing metabolic plasticity, issue subject review.
