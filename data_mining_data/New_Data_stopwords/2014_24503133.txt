 Advances understanding glioma biology led increase targeted therapies preclinical clinical trials; however, cellular heterogeneity often precludes targeted molecules found glioma cells, thus reducing efficacy treatments. contrast, one trait shared virtually tumor cells altered (dysregulated) metabolism. Tumor cells increased reliance glucose, suggesting treatments affecting cellular metabolism may effective method improve current therapies. Indeed, metabolism focus cancer research last years, many pathways long associated tumor growth found intersect metabolic pathways cell. ketogenic diet (high fat, low carbohydrate protein), caloric restriction, fasting cause metabolic change, specifically, reduction blood glucose increase blood ketones. We, others, demonstrated metabolic changes improve survival animal models malignant gliomas potentiate anti-tumor effect chemotherapies radiation treatment. review discuss use metabolic alteration treatment malignant brain tumors.
