 Chronic administration antidepressants required efficacy, suggesting involvement long-term modifications. impact antidepressant treatment brain molecular machinery completely understood, performed proteomic analysis rat hippocampus frontal cortex chronic treatment fluoxetine, NK1 receptor antagonist, GR205171, CRF receptor 1 antagonist, DMP696. 2D electrophoresis, protein expression levels compared univariate multivariate statistical analyses identified mass spectrometry. treatments modified levels actin isoforms, whereas fluoxetine GR205171 reduced synapsin II. Fluoxetine treatment increased ERK2 NP25 decreased vacuolar ATP synthase. GR205171 treatment, protein disulphide isomerase reduced; dynamin 1 aldose reductase increased. DMP696 modulated DRP2, pyruvate kinase, LDH ATP synthase. Although compound induced specific pattern protein modulation, data suggest antidepressants share ability modulating neural plasticity.
