 UhpABC regulatory system enterobacteria controls expression hexose phosphate transporter UhpT. Signaling initiated sensing extracellular glucose 6-phosphate membrane-bound UhpC, turn modulates histidine-protein kinase UhpB. Together cytoplasmic response regulator UhpA, constitute typical two-component regulatory system based His-to-Asp phosphoryl transfer. Activated (i.e., phosphorylated) UhpA binds promoter region uhpT, resulting initiation transcription. investigated contribution transmembrane signaling (through UhpBC) intracellular activation (through UhpA) overall Uhp response (UhpT expression) vivo. UhpA activation could made independent transmembrane signaling (Delta)uhpBC cells grown pyruvate. Inorganic phosphate interfered glucose 6-phosphate-dependent, UhpBC-mediated, well pyruvate-mediated activation UhpA. relationship concentration inducer (glucose 6-phosphate) Uhp induction rate nonhyperbolic, indicating positive cooperativity. degree cooperativity affected carbon energy source available cells growth. pyruvate-mediated activation UhpA (Delta)uhpBC cells could result considerably stronger UhpT expression glucose 6-phosphate-dependent activation UhpBC, observed positive cooperativity overall pathway wild-type cells may reflect previously described cooperative binding UhpA uhpT promoter (J. L. Dahl et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:1910-1919, 1997).
