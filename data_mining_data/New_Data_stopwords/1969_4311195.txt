 Cell-free extracts aerobically grown Streptococcus agalactiae cells possess reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase linked oxygen. inhibited cyanide, although cytochromes evidently involved. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation occurs reaction, 66 75% total ATP formed nonoxidatively. remaining 25 35% ATP formation related oxidation NADH. formation ATP oxidative reaction prevented excluding oxygen adding cyanide prevent NADH oxidation. also prevented adding methylene blue pyruvate, bypasses electron transport oxygen, interfere NADH oxidation. Potential sources ATP, glycolysis, pyruvate oxidase reaction, oxidative pentose cycle, present, high nonoxidative ATP formation ascribed adenylate kinase reaction. reaction requires adenosine diphosphate (ADP) phosphate acceptor. NADH oxidation independent ADP. Antimycin A, amytal, 2,4-dinitrophenol decreased, prevent, oxidative formation ATP. P:O ratios ranged 0.15 0.25. oxidative activity soluble portion cell-free extracts.
