 Converging experimental data indicate neuroprotective action L-Lactate. Using Digital Holographic Microscopy, observe transient application glutamate (100 muM; 2 min) elicits NMDA-dependent death 65% mouse cortical neurons culture. presence L-Lactate (or Pyruvate), percentage neuronal death decreases 32%. UK5099, blocker Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier, fully prevents L-Lactate-mediated neuroprotection. addition, L-Lactate-induced neuroprotection inhibited probenicid carbenoxolone, two blockers ATP channel pannexins, also abolished apyrase, enzyme degrading ATP, suggesting ATP produced Lactate/Pyruvate pathway released act purinergic receptors autocrine/paracrine manner. Finally, pharmacological approaches support involvement P2Y receptors associated PI3-kinase pathway, leading activation KATP channels. set results indicates L-Lactate acts signalling molecule neuroprotection excitotoxicity coordinated cellular pathways involving ATP production, release activation P2Y/KATP cascade.
