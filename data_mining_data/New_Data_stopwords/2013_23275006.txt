 Cells undergoing malignant transformation often exhibit shift cellular metabolism oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis. glycolytic shift, called Warburg effect, provides mechanistic basis targeting glycolysis suppress carcinogenesis use dietary caloric restriction energy restriction-mimetic agents (ERMA). recently reported development novel class ERMAs exhibits high potency eliciting starvation-associated cellular responses epigenetic changes cancer cells though glucose uptake inhibition. lead ERMA class, OSU-CG5, decreases production ATP NADH LNCaP prostate cancer cells. study, examined effect OSU-CG5 severity preneoplastic lesions male transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Daily oral treatment OSU-CG5 100 mg/kg 6 10 weeks age resulted statistically significant decrease weight urogenital tract microdissected dorsal, lateral, anterior prostatic lobes relative vehicle controls. suppressive effect OSU-CG5 evidenced marked decreases Ki67 immunostaining proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression prostate. OSU-CG5 treatment associated evidence systemic toxicity. Microarray analysis indicated central role Akt, Western blot analysis showed reduced phosphorylation and/or expression levels Akt, Src, androgen receptor, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor prostate lobes. findings support investigation OSU-CG5 potential chemopreventive agent.
