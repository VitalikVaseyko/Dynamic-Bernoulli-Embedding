 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) transmembrane proteins detect variety molecular components mostly derived microorganisms. TLR2 TLR4 amongst others present liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle. Extracellular long-chain fatty acids bind TLR2 4 induce downstream signalling cascades implicated cellular stress inflammatory processes. Evidence indicates TLR activation non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) may participate development insulin resistance. Exercise seems induce downregulation TLR expression various tissues, mechanism may take part protective effect exercise insulin resistance. Moreover, TLRs seem mediate activation mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 Jun-amino-terminal kinase extracellular NEFAs endurance exercise. type exercise, circulating NEFAs known regulate expression various genes including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, uncoupling protein 3, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha. Whether events initiated TLR-dependent signal transduction remains investigated.
