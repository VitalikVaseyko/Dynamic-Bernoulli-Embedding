 Despite increasing knowledge specific pathogenicity factors bacteria, contribution metabolic processes virulence largely unknown. Here, elucidate tight connection pathogenicity core metabolism enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis integrated transcriptome [(13)C]fluxome analysis wild type virulence-regulator mutants. aerobic growth glucose, Y. pseudotuberculosis reveals unusual flux distribution high level secreted pyruvate. absence transcriptional post-transcriptional regulators RovA, CsrA, Crp strongly perturbs fluxes carbon core metabolism level pyruvate metabolism tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, perturbations accompanied transcriptional changes corresponding enzymes. Knock-outs regulators metabolic branch point central enzyme, pyruvate kinase (DeltapykF), result mutants significantly reduced virulence oral mouse infection model. summary, work identifies pyruvate-TCA cycle node focal point controlling host colonization virulence Yersinia.
