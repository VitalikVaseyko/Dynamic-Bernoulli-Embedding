 Deficiency R-type pyruvate kinase (R-PK) causes autosomal recessive, hereditary, nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA). screened seven unrelated patients south Italy known mutations found one patient homozygous 1529A (R510Q) mutation, two others bearing 1456T (R486W) mutation, one homozygous another heterozygous, two heterozygotes 994A mutation (G332S). also found three novel mutations heterozygote status: G C transversion position 1010 (1010C; R337P) C transition position 1492 (1492T; R498C), missense, G transversion position 1523 (1523G; L508Z), produces stop codon subsequent loss C-terminal protein domain. structural features R-PK mutation-bearing regions examined. cases mutations altered local conformation enzyme. G332S R337P highly conserved sequence regions. particular, R337P mutation significantly affects intersubunit interactions, located region subjected large conformational change occurs R-->T allosteric transition, essential enzyme activity. R486W mutation affects external pocketlike region, producing local conformational change; R498C mutation changes interactions among neighbouring residues; R510Q mutation involves loss interdomain interactions may reduce enzyme stability activity. data also indicate patients Southern Italy, pyruvate kinase deficiency heterogeneous, 1529A mutation, frequent mutation U.S. Caucasian population, lower frequency.
