 Metastatic tumors generally exhibit aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect). advent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging, coupled recent findings linking hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) overexpression aggressive cancers, rekindled interest aspect tumor metabolism. studies explore role HIF-1alpha human breast cancer lines relationship glycolytic regulation. demonstrate that, normal oxygen conditions, nonmetastatic cells consume less glucose express low HIF-1alpha, whereas metastatic cells constitutively express high glycolysis HIF-1alpha, suggesting dysregulation HIF-1alpha may induce Warburg effect. hypothesis tested renormalizing HIF-1alpha levels renal carcinoma cells, leading inhibition aerobic glycolysis.
