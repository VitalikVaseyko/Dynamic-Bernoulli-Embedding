 Enzymatic activities determined prosencephalon rats exposed repeatedly 8 hrs, either age 1 17 days adulthood, altitude 7,000 barometric chamber (up total 104 hrs). activity enzymes assayed 20 hrs last exposure. results compared values obtained 20 hrs single 8-hour exposure stimulated altitude 7,000 17-day-old adult rats. young rats single exposure hypoxia, elevated activity LDH isoCDH, GPT CPK decreased. repeated hypoxia, significant increasw noted activity PK decrease GPT CPK. adulthood, single exposure hypoxia causes greatest increase CPK, LDH GOT reduced. Following repeated hypoxia, none enzyme activities increased 20%, LDH, GOT, GIDH CPK lower. concluded results single exposure hypoxia increases anaerobic glycolysis immature nervous tissue improves oxygen utilization. relationship glycid amino acid metabolism appreciably altered. hand, general reduction bioenergetics biosynthesis occurs adulthood. Repeated hypoxia, contrary, similar after-effects age groups, namely inhibition aerobic metabolism relations glycid amino acid metabolism.
