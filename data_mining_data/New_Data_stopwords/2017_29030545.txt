 Yeast cancer cells share unusual characteristic favoring fermentation sugar respiration. reveal evolutionary conserved mechanism linking fermentation activation Ras, major regulator cell proliferation yeast mammalian cells, prime proto-oncogene product. yeast mutant (tps1) overactive influx glucose glycolysis hyperaccumulation Fru1,6bisP, shows hyperactivation Ras, causes glucose growth defect triggering apoptosis. Fru1,6bisP potent activator Ras permeabilized yeast cells, likely acting Cdc25. yeast, glucose triggers activation Ras downstream targets MEK ERK mammalian cells. Biolayer interferometry measurements show physiological concentrations Fru1,6bisP stimulate dissociation pure Sos1/H-Ras complex. Thermal shift assay confirms direct binding Sos1, mammalian ortholog Cdc25. results suggest Warburg effect creates vicious cycle Fru1,6bisP activation Ras, enhanced fermentation stimulates oncogenic potency.Yeast cancer cells favor sugar fermentation aerobic conditions. authors describe conserved mechanism yeast mammals glycolysis intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate binds Cdc25/Sos1 couples increased glycolytic flux increased Ras proto-oncoprotein activity.
