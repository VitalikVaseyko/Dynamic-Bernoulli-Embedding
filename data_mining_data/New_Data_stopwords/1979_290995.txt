 addition naturally occurring polyamines inorganic ions vitro protein-synthesizing system improved extent fidelity translation. optimized system, regeneration nucleoside triphosphates phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) reduced missense error frequency vivo level well enhanced extent translation. effect nucleoside triphosphate regeneration shown due primarily increase ratio adenosine guanosine triphosphates hydrolysis products marginally due increase absolute concentrations nucleoside triphosphates.
