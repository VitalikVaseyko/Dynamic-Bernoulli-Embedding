 experimental system developed aquatic plants using mass spectrometry technique infrared gas analysis CO(2), studied responses various O(2) concentrations gas exchanges red macroalga Chondrus crispus S. results follows. (a) Irrespective CO(2) concentration, net photosynthesis O(2) sensitive 45 70% stimulation 2% O(2). Even high CO(2), significant Warburg effect detected. (b) Although photosynthesis CO(2) sensitive, O(2) photoconsumption weakly affected CO(2) even high CO(2) still photodependent. (c) O(2) photoconsumption always sensitive O(2) concentration whatever CO(2) concentration, O(2) exceeding 20% kinetics disagreed Michaelis-Menten model, saturation reached rapidly. various CO(2) concentrations, apparent K(m) (O(2)) ranged 4 16% O(2) relatively constant V(max) (O(2)) one-third V(max) (CO(2)). (d) Dark respiration seemed O(2) insensitive. results discussed relation nature processes able consume O(2) light, seem consistent significant involvement Mehlertype reaction.
