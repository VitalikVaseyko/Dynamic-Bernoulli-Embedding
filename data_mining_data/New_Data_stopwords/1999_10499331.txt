 Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) utilized analytical method perform investigations limited proteolysis proteins. purpose partial proteolysis experiments series proteinases performed, utilizing model protein pyruvate kinase (PK) Escherichia coli, enzyme regulated allosterically fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Data obtained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) MEKC compared; profiles generated submitting digests PK treated different proteinases presence absence FBP electrophoretic analysis provided useful adjunct better understanding effects allosteric activator conformation model enzyme. MEKC also found convenient technique determining kinetics substrate proteolysis.
