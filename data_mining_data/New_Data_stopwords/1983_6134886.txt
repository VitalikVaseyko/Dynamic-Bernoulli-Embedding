 thirteen-year-old boy congenital haemolytic anaemia due pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency aplastic crisis. serum parvovirus-like virus (SPLV) demonstrated blood electron microscopy and, subsequently, IgM IgG antibodies prototype SPLV B19 detected. attempt define level erythropoiesis involved parvovirus-induced bone marrow suppression, levels circulating early erythroid progenitors (burst forming units erythroid, BFU-E) monitored crisis recovery period. virus-containing plasma inhibited formation BFU-Es non-immune subjects effect neutralised convalescent serum. Colony forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) also inhibited probably non-specific since neutralisation reverse effect. experiments, together clinical data, suggest selective effect SPLV stage erythroid progenitors.
