 Stress considerable impact welfare productivity fish, blood glucose level fish may factor modulating stress response. study evaluated effect blood glucose level handling acute stress response grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella. Fish intraperitoneally injected glucose 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 mg g(-1) body mass (BM) exposed handling 5 min. Glucose injection resulted increase plasma glucose level liver glycogen content decrease plasma lactate level. Handling resulted increase plasma levels cortisol, glucose, lactate plasma lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) activity decrease liver glycogen content. 1 h post-stress, plasma cortisol level lower stressed fish injected glucose 0.5 mg g(-1) BM stressed fish injected glucose 0, 0.2, 1.0 mg g(-1) BM. significant differences found activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) pyruvate kinase (PK) liver stressed unstressed fish, regardless dose glucose injection. 1 h post-stress, liver glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity higher fish without glucose injection fish injected glucose. study reveals blood glucose level affect stress response grass carp modulating cortisol release glucose homeostasis glycogen metabolism gluconeogenesis liver.
