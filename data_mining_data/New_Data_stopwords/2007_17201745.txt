 1. Cardiac lipotoxicity characterized hypertrophy contractile dysfunction triggered impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation lipid accumulation. present study investigated effect dietary fatty acid intake alone combination inhibition mitochondrial fatty acid uptake carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT)-I inhibitor oxfenicine. Long-chain fatty acids activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), thus mRNA levels PPAR target genes measured. 2. Rats untreated given CPT-I inhibitor oxfenicine (150 mg/kg per day) fed 8 weeks either: (i) standard low-fat chow (10% energy fat); (ii) long-chain saturated fatty acid diet; (iii) long-chain unsaturated fatty acid diet; (iv) medium-chain fatty acid diet (which bypasses CPT-I). High-fat diets contained 60% energy fat. 3. Cardiac triglyceride content increased absence oxfenicine saturated fat group compared diets. Oxfenicine treatment increased cardiac triglyceride stores saturated fat group caused significant increase unsaturated fat group. Despite elevations triglyceride stores, left ventricular mass, end diastolic volume systolic function unaffected. 4. mRNA levels PPAR-regulated genes increased high saturated unsaturated fat diets compared standard chow medium chain fatty acid chow. Oxfenicine upregulate PPARalpha target genes within dietary treatment group. 5. Taken together, data suggest consuming high-fat diet inhibiting CPT-I result cardiac hypertrophy cardiac dysfunction normal rats.
