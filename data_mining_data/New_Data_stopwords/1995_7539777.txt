 Several phosphoserine, phosphothreonine phosphotyrosine synthons suitable stepwise synthesis phosphopeptides prepared. Treatment methylthiomethyl (MTM) esters either Z-, Boc-, Allocserine threonine phosphochloridate pyridine followed MgBr2 cleavage MTM diethyl ether afforded title compounds good yield. Thiophosphoserine phosphotyrosine synthons also obtained phosphoramidite method using di-(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)-N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite MCPBA oxidizing reagent. Trichloroethyl proved valuable phosphate protecting group especially phosphotyrosine derivatives owing stability acidic conditions. synthons involved liquid-phase synthesis several phospho and/or thiophosphopeptides related either src-protein kinase rat liver pyruvate kinase.
