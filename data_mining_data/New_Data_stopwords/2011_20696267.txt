 roles insulin insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) regulation glucose metabolism assessed European sea bass juveniles fed distinct dietary carbohydrate levels. Three isonitrogenous diets formulated contain 10% (10%PGS) 30% (30%PGS) pregelatinized starch starch (control). highest plasma glucose insulin levels observed 6h feeding fish receiving 30%PGS diet. Although plasma IGF-I higher 6h 24h feeding, effect dietary carbohydrate level noticed within sampling time. Increasing dietary carbohydrate level resulted increase liver muscle glycogen content. Hepatic glucokinase (GK) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities increased dietary carbohydrate content, whereas pyruvate kinase (PK) activity higher fish fed carbohydrate containing diets carbohydrate-free diet. GK activity higher 6h 24h feeding, whereas opposite observed G6PD activity. Data suggest nutritional conditions assayed plasma glucose insulin secretagogue. Furthermore, insulin appears important role IGF-I stimulating hepatic glucose uptake, thus enhancing GK activity leading increase liver glycogen content maintain glucose homeostasis.
