 Experiments carried determine whether pyrophosphate: fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase (PFP) catalyses rapid recycling triose phosphates found cytosol heterotrophic cell cultures Chenopodium rubrum L. (W.-D. Hatzfeld, M. Stitt, 1990, Planta, 180, 198-204). Oxygen uptake, carbohydrate turnover, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru2,6bisP), glycolytic intermediates, adenine uridine nucleotides, pyrophosphate activity PFP glycolytic enzymes monitored 48 h subculturing carbohydrate-depleted cells onto glucose. Immediately transfer increase amount Fru2,6bisP, hexose phosphate. triose phosphates, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate inorganic pyrophosphate increased gradually next 24 h. accompanied tripling extractable activity PFP, phosphofructokinase. activity fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 20-50fold lower PFP. calculated activity PFP high enough catalyse observed rate cycling triose phosphates hexose phosphates, based measured Vmax capacity enzyme, known kinetic properties, measured levels reactants Fru2,6bisP. changes levels Fru2,6bisP correlated rate respiration. Instead, rate O2 uptake inversely related phosphoenolpyruvate level, showing pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase regulating use glucose respiration. also relation Fru2,6bisP, partitioning sucrose starch. proposed main function cycle cells maintain high levels inorganic pyrophosphate triose phosphates, necessary remobilisation sucrose biosynthesis plastid, 'coarse' 'fine' control PFP play important role regulating cycle.
