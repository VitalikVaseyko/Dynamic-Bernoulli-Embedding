 previous phylogenetic study family pyruvate kinase EC (2.7.1.40), cluster Glu117 another Lys117 found (numbered according rabbit muscle enzyme). sequences Glu117 found K+-dependent, whereas Lys117 K+-independent. Interestingly, gamma-proteobacteria exhibit sequences branches tree. context, explored whether phylogenetically distinct pyruvate kinases expressed contribute pyruvate kinase activity Vibrio cholerae. main findings work showed isozyme Glu117 active K+-dependent enzyme. substrate concentration, Vmax absence fructose 1,6 bisphosphate 80% effector. result accordance non-essential activation described allosteric ligands pyruvate kinases. contrast, pyruvate kinase Lys117 K+-independent enzyme displaying allosteric activation ribose 5-phosphate. substrate concentration, activity without effector 0.5% one obtained presence ribose 5-phosphate, indicating sugar monophosphate strong activator enzyme. absolute allosteric dependence novel feature pyruvate kinase activity. Interestingly, K+-independent enzyme, Mn2+ may "mimic" allosteric effect Rib 5-P. Despite different allosteric behavior, isozymes display rapid equilibrium random order kinetic mechanism. intracellular concentrations fructose 1,6-bisphosphate ribose 5-phosphate Vibrio cholerae experimentally verified sufficient induce maximal activation enzymes. addition, Western blot analysis indicated enzymes co-expressed. Therefore, concluded VcIPK VcIIPK contribute activity pyruvate kinase gamma-proteobacterium.
