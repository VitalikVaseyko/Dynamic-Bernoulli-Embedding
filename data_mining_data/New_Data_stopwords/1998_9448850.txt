 accurate determination low concentrations ATP important many areas pure applied biochemistry, particularly hygiene monitoring food industry. Two mathematical models used show luciferase-linked ATP recycling enzyme assay determine sample ATP concentration time taken observed bioluminescence reach half maximum value. time-based assay potential detect low ATP concentrations less 10 min without need sensitive photometer.
