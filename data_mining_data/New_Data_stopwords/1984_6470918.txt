 second third trimesters increasing activities glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase found human amniotic fluid. term (37 42 weeks), steep rise amniotic fluid pyruvate kinase noticed, may serve additional prenatal indicator fetal maturity. presumable main sources enzyme amniotic fluid epithelium cells skin, respiratory tract amnion. meconium stained amniotic fluid pyruvate kinase activity detectable. Addition meconium amniotic fluid samples previously present pyruvate kinase activity leads disappearance enzyme activity.
