 reexamined concept glucagon controls gluconeogenesis lactate-pyruvate isolated rat hepatocytes almost entirely inhibition flux pyruvate kinase, thereby making gluconeogenesis efficient. 1. tested refined 14C-tracer technique previously yielded opposite conclusion, is, inhibition pyruvate kinase relatively unimportant mechanism. tracer procedure, used us, found insensitive size pyruvate pool, experiments using modifications technique obviate number potential errors support earlier conclusion control pyruvate kinase predominant mechanism. 2. stimulation formation glucose results inhibition pyruvate kinase consequence elevation steady-state concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate subsequent intermediates gluconeogenic pathway. ongoing stimulation glucose synthesis glucagon isolated hepatocytes, concentrations measured intermediate compounds phosphoenolpyruvate glucose elevated except triose phosphates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. failure compounds rise control levels indicates gluconeogenic reactions beyond pyruvate kinase accelerated thermodynamically would occur predominant control pyruvate kinase. conclude, therefore, although glucagon inhibits flux pyruvate kinase reaction, account stimulation gluconeogenesis. Major control sites also within pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate segment fructose 1,6-bisphosphate cycle.
