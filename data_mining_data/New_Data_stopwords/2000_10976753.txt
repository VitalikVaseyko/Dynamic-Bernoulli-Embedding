 Transcription L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) S14 genes induced hepatocytes response increased glucose metabolism. regulatory sequences genes responsible induction glucose mapped related E-box containing motifs promoters. Similarly, L-PK promoter activity stimulated differentiated pancreatic beta-cell line, INS-1, response elevated glucose. mutational analysis, demonstrate sequence requirements glucose induction INS-1 cell identical observed hepatocyte, suggesting transcriptional factor(s) responsible regulation L-PK expression two cell types. One nuclear factor binds glucose regulatory sequences genes Upstream Stimulatory Factor (USF), ubiquitous E-box binding protein. Mice deleted USF2 gene display severely delayed response carbohydrate feeding (Vallet et al. [26]). observation, however, differentiate direct indirect role USF process. gain insight possible involvement USF glucose signaling, used recombinant adenoviral construct expresses dominant negative form USF. dominant negative dimerize endogenous USF shown inhibit DNA binding USF hepatocytes INS-1 cells. However, expression dominant negative USF block ability glucose stimulate L-PK S14 gene expression hepatocytes L-PK promoter activity INS-1 cells. conclude USF act binding glucose regulatory sequences S14 L-PK genes role USF process glucose induction indirect.
