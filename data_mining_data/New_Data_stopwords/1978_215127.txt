 1. Comparison maximum activities pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase large number muscles invertebrates vertebrates indicates that, general, individual muscle, activity pyruvate kinase severalfold higher phosphofructokinase. consistent suggestion, based mass-action ratio data, pyruvate kinase reaction non-equilibrium muscle. However, range activities pyruvate kinase muscles considerably larger phosphofructokinase. difference almost disappears enzyme activities muscles known possess anaerobic ;succinate pathway' excluded. suggested that, muscles, phosphofructokinase provides glycolytic residues pyruvate kinase (i.e. glycolysis) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (i.e. succinate pathway). supported negative correlation activity ratio, pyruvate kinase/phosphofructokinase, activities nucleoside diphosphokinase muscles, since high activities nucleoside diphosphokinase considered indicate presence succinate pathway. 2. effect fructose bisphosphate activities pyruvate kinase many different muscles studied. stimulatory effect fructose bisphosphate appears lost whenever efficient system supply oxygen muscles developed (e.g. insects, squids, birds mammals). suggests activation pyruvate kinase important co-ordinated regulation glycolysis anaerobic hypoxic conditions, change glycolytic flux transition rest activity needs large order provide sufficient energy contractile activity. However, lack effect anaerobic muscles birds mammals suggests another metabolic control may exist avian mammalian pyruvate kinase muscles.
