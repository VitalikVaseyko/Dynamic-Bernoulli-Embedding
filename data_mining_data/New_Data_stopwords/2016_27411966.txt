 H2S important signalling molecule involved diverse biological processes. mediates formation cysteine persulfides (R-S-SH), affect activity target proteins. Like thiols, persulfides show reactivity towards electrophiles behave similarly cysteine modifications biotin switch assay. manuscript, report qPerS-SID mass spectrometry-based method allowing isolation persulfide containing peptides mammalian proteome. method, demonstrated H2S donors differ efficacy induce persulfides HEK293 cells. Furthermore, data analysis revealed persulfide formation affects subcellular compartments various cellular processes. Negatively charged amino acids appeared frequently adjacent cysteines forming persulfides. confirmed proteomic data using pyruvate kinase M2 model protein showed several cysteine residues prone persulfide formation finally leading inactivation. Taken together, site-specific identification persulfides proteome scale help identify target proteins involved H2S signalling enlightens biology H2S releasing agents.
