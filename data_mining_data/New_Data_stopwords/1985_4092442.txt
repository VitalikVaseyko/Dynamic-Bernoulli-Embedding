 Pyruvate kinase sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) shows positive cooperativity respect substrates PEP ADP. temperature modulator activity, changing KS0.5 Hill coefficient values PEP. enzyme shows alanine ATP inhibition F-1,6-P2 activation 22 degrees C. F-1,6-P2 eliminates effect alanine ATP. results could indicate regulation enzyme temperature possess kinetic properties similar L-type mammals.
