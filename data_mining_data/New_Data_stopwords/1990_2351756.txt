 Single muscle fibres soleus (SOL) well extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles Wistar male rats relaxing solution divided three types histochemical features--slow-twitch oxidative (SO), fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic (FOG), fast-twitch glycolytic (FG) fibres. relationship ultrastructural profiles (mitochondrial volume, number, Z-line width) metabolic profiles (glycolytic oxidative enzymes' activity) analyzed using types fibres dissected different SOL EDL muscles using stereological biochemical techniques. Z-line width specialized different fibre types. Fast-twitch (FG FOG) fibres narrow Z-line width compared slow-twitch (SO) fibre SOL EDL muscles. significant difference observed SOL muscle FOG fibres EDL muscle FOG fibres. glycolytic (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) creatine kinase (CK) activities FOG fibres EDL muscles significantly higher (p less 0.01) dissected SOL muscles. oxidative enzyme (succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity FOG fibres dissected SOL muscle significantly higher (p less 0.01) dissected EDL muscles. Mitochondrial volume number fibres dissected SOL muscle significantly higher (volume, p less 0.01, number, p less 0.01) dissected EDL muscles. significant difference observed mitochondrial volume FOG fibres SOL EDL muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
