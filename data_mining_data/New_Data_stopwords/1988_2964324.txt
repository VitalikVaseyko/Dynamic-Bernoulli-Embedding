 Peripheral hyperinsulinaemia cause metabolic changes might contribute high incidence macrovascular disease patients diabetes mellitus. order test hypothesis muscle biopsies 12 Type 2 diabetic patients 14 age sex matched non-diabetic patients, undergoing minor surgery, obtained. diabetic patients significantly elevated fasting serum insulin (0.29 +/- 0.05 vs 0.06 +/- 0.03 nmol-1) glucose (8.3 +/- 1.5 vs 4.6 +/- 0.5 mmol-1) HbA1 levels (8.4 +/- 0.4 vs 5.0 +/- 0.2 per cent). fasting 2-h postprandial C-peptide levels 0.99 +/- 0.25 vs 0.39 +/- 0.12 3.12 +/- 0.75 vs 1.09 +/- 0.34 nmol/l, respectively. diabetic patients showed marked elevation triglyceride striated muscle biopsies compared non-diabetic controls (290 +/- 52 vs 48 +/- 6 mumol/g wet weight, p less 0.001). Moreover, activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.25 +/- 0.03 vs 0.13 +/- 0.01 U/g wet weight) malic enzyme (0.15 +/- 0.01 vs 0.05 +/- 0.01 U/g wet weight), necessary lipid synthesis, significantly increased (both p less 0.001) diabetic patients glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase (0.65 +/- 0.09 vs 1.82 +/- 0.11 U/g wet weight), pyruvate kinase (7.3 +/- 0.9 vs 13.2 +/- 0.9 U/g wet weight), phosphofructokinase (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs 2.6 +/- 0.2 U/g wet weight), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (7.3 +/- 0.5 vs 12.5 +/- 0.7 U/g wet weight) decreased (all p less 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
