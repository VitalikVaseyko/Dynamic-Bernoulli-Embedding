 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase deficiency rare cause hemolytic anemia and, severe form, requires splenectomy childhood. pregnancy, severe cases traditionally managed prophylactic blood transfusions keep hemoglobin concentration arbitrary thresholds 7-8 g/dL. CASE: case severe pyruvate kinase deficiency anemia managed conservatively without blood transfusions even though hemoglobin concentration reached nadir 6.8 g/dL. perinatal outcome good. CONCLUSION: cases severe pyruvate kinase deficiency anemia, pregnancy per se might indication prophylactic blood transfusions.
