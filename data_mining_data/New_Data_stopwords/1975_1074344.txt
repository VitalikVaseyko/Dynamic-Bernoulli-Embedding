 Enzyme abnormalities frequently found red cells patients various acquired blood disorders. leukaemias, preleukaemic states bone marrow insufficiencies without sideroblastosis, changes enzyme activity usually characterized coexistence deficiency enzymes increased activity others. frequently decreased activities pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase,2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase adenylate kinase; frequently increased activities hexokinase, aldolase, enolase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. primary myelofibrosis polycythaemia rubra vera, enzyme deficiencies infrequent differ observed leukaemias related disorders. Phosphohexose isomerase phosphoglucomutase deficiencies seem relatively specific polycythaemia rubra vera. Explanations acquired enzymopathies still stage hypothesis. theory multiple genetic damage may explain findings yet proved right. possibility post-translational molecular modification suggested working hypothesis.
