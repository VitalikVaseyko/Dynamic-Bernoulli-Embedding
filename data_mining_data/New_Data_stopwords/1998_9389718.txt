 present novel G1091 mutation human liver red blood cell (RBC) pyruvate kinase (PK) gene causing severe hemolytic anemia. two families, three children severely PK-deficient compound heterozygotes exhibiting G1091 mutation common G1529 mutation allele. one family, mother, G1091 heterozygote, later second baby new husband, also G1091 carrier. baby homozygous G1091 mutation died 6 weeks birth severe hemolysis. mutant alleles expressed RNA level. G1091 mutation results substitution conserved glycine aspartate domain RBC PK, whereas G1529 mutation leads substitution conserved arginine residue glutamine C-domain. Molecular modelling human RBC PK, based crystal structure cat muscle PK, shows mutations located outside catalytic site interface domains C. mutations likely disrupt critical conformation interface introducing alternative salt bridges. way Gly364 Asp Arg510 Gln substitutions may cause PK deficiency influencing allosteric properties enzyme.
