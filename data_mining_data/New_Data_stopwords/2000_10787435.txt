 glycolytic enzyme, L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK), plays important role hepatic glucose metabolism. Insulin glucose induce L-PK gene expression, glucagon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) inhibit L-PK gene expression. interested defining PUFA regulation L-PK. cis-regulatory target PUFA action includes imperfect direct repeat (DR1) binds HNF-4. HNF4 plays ancillary role insulin/glucose-mediated transactivation L-PK gene. fatty acid-activated nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARalpha), binds DR1-like elements reported interfere HNF4 action, examined role PPARalpha plays regulation L-PK gene transcription. Feeding rats either fish oil potent PPARalpha activator, WY14,643, suppressed rat hepatic L-PK mRNA gene transcription. PPARalpha-null mouse used evaluate role PPARalpha hepatic transcriptional control L-PK. WY14,643 control L-PK gene expression required PPARalpha, PUFA regulation L-PK gene expression independent PPARalpha. Transfection studies cultured primary hepatocytes localized cis-regulatory target WY14,643/PPARalpha action L-PK HNF4 binding site. However, PPARalpha/RXRalpha heterodimers bind region. Although WY14,643 PUFA suppress L-PK gene transcription element, PUFA regulation L-PK require PPARalpha PPARalpha/RXRalpha bind L-PK promoter. studies suggest intermediary factors involved PUFA PPARalpha regulation L-PK gene transcription.
