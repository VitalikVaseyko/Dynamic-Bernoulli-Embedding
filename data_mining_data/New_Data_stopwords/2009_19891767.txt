 BACKGROUND: Signal Transducer Activator Transcription 1 (STAT1) traditionally regarded transmitter interferon signaling pro-apoptotic tumour suppressor. Recent data identified new functions STAT1 associated tumourigenesis resistance genotoxic stress, including ionizing radiation (IR) chemotherapy. investigate mechanisms contributing tumourigenic functions STAT1, performed combined transcriptomic-proteomic expressional analysis found STAT1 associated regulation energy metabolism potential implication Warburg effect. METHODS: generated stable knockdown STAT1 SCC61 human squamous cell carcinoma cell line, established tumour xenografts athymic mice, compared transcriptomic proteomic profiles STAT1 wild-type (WT) knockdown (KD) untreated irradiated (IR) tumours. Transcriptional profiling based Affymetrix Human GeneChip(R) Gene 1.0 ST microarrays. Proteomes determined tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data searching human subset UniProt database. Data analysed using Significance Analysis Microarrays ribonucleic acid Visualize software proteins. Functional analysis performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis statistical significance measured Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Knockdown STAT1 led significant growth suppression untreated tumours radio sensitization irradiated tumours. changes accompanied alterations expression genes proteins glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (GG), citrate cycle (CC) oxidative phosphorylation (OP). pathways, GG concordant changes gene protein expression demonstrated STAT1-dependent expression genes proteins consistent tumour-specific glycolysis. addition, IR drastically suppressed GG pathway STAT1 KD tumours without significant change STAT1 WT tumours. CONCLUSION: results identify previously uncharacterized function STAT1 tumours: expressional regulation genes encoding proteins involved glycolysis, citrate cycle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, predominant regulation glycolytic genes. STAT1-dependent expressional regulation glycolysis suggests potential role STAT1 transcriptional modulator genes responsible Warburg effect.
