 sequenced phosphoenolpyruvate synthases (PPS), pyruvate:phosphate dikinases (PPDK) enzymes (EI) phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system comprise PEP family. Linked C terminus sequenced pyruvate kinase Bacillus stearothermophilus (PKBst) domain homologous putative phosphorylation domains PEP family enzymes. report sequence phylogenetic analyses lead following conclusions: (1) phosphorylation domain PKBst derived PPS, late evolutionary process, divergence PPSs PPDKs EIs; (2) domain probably functional phosphoryl transfer; (3) C-terminal phosphorylation domain PKBst probably defines compact domain PEP family proteins linked domains proteins via flexible linkers.
