 Previous evidence indicated increased cancer risk individuals diabetes mellitus (DM). aim study investigate relationship DM (high glucose) tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) high glucose mediated metastatic potential TSCC. relationship DM TSCC assessed retrospective study. role mechanism high glucose proliferation, metastatic potential TSCC investigated vitro vivo. prevalence rate DM patients TSCC 12.84%, significantly higher (9.7%) general population China. Although significant difference observed overall survival (OS) rate, TSCC patients DM 1.38-fold increase relative risk affecting 5-year OS compared patients without DM. High glucose enhanced TSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion upregulated PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) expression. Whereas, effect abolished knockdown PKM2 TSCC cells. High glucose promoted tumour growth lung metastasis TSCC DM animal model. results confirm DM risk factor development TSCC. High glucose enhances metastatic potential TSCC stimulation PKM2 pathway.
