 BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) enigmatic vascular syndrome characterized increased pulmonary arterial pressure adverse remodelling pulmonary arterioles often right ventricle. Drawing parallels tumourigenesis, recent endeavours explored relationship metabolic dysregulation PH pathogenesis. DESIGN: discuss general mechanisms cellular stressors hypoxia inflammation alter cellular metabolism. Based principles, explore development corresponding metabolic pathophenotype PH, focus Groups III, implications alterations may future treatment disease. RESULTS: Investigation metabolic dysregulation pulmonary vasculature right ventricle PH pathogenesis provided unifying understanding disparate disease triggers coordinate end-stage disease manifestations. Namely, defined originally various cancers, Warburg effect describes chronic shift energy production mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis. many cases, Warburg phenotype may serve central causative mechanism PH progression, largely driving cellular hyperproliferation resistance apoptosis. Consequently, new therapeutic strategies increasingly pursued target Warburg phenotype. Finally, new technologies increasingly becoming available probe completely complexities metabolic cellular reprogramming may reveal distinct metabolic pathways beyond Warburg effect drive PH. CONCLUSION: Studies metabolic dysregulation PH emerging may offer powerful therapeutic means prevent even reverse disease progression molecular level.
