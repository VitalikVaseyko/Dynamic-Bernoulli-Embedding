 effects oxalate glycolysis glucose production trioses studied hepatocytes isolated fed fasted rats. 1--In cells fed rats oxalate inhibited glycolysis pyruvate kinase step, shown increased phosphoenolpyruvate concentration, decreased lactate pyruvate production reduction glycolytic flux estimated rate detritiation [6-3H] glucose. plot 1/lactate production versus oxalate concentration showed pyruvate kinase limiting step glycolysis allowed determine apparent inhibition constant oxalate: 3035 microM near physiological concentration blood oxalate. conditions pyruvate kinase glycolytic flux inhibited, oxalate effect synthesis [14C] glucose [14C] triose. 2--In hepatocytes prepared fasted rats incubated lactate pyruvate, oxalate decreased gluconeogenesis. cells isolated fasted rats incubated dihydroxyacetone, oxalate decreased lactate pyruvate production whereas glucose synthesis remained unchanged. concluded inhibition pyruvate kinase cannot increase gluconeogenic flux triose.
