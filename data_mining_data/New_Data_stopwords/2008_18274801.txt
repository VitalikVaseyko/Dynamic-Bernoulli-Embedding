 Chronic hemodynamic overload heart results pathological myocardial hypertrophy, eventually followed heart failure. Phosphatase calcineurin crucial mediator response. Little known, however, role calcineurin response acute alterations loading conditions heart, could mediating beneficial adaptational processes. therefore analyzed proteome changes following short-term increase preload rabbit myocardium absence presence calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A. Rabbit right ventricular isolated papillary muscles cultivated muscle chamber system physiological conditions remained either completely unloaded stretched preload 3 mN/mm(2), performing isotonic contractions (zero afterload). 6 h, proteome changes detected two-dimensional gel electrophoresis ESI-MS/MS. identified 28 proteins upregulated preload compared unloaded group (at least 1.75-fold regulation, P < 0.05). Specifically, mechanical load upregulated variety enzymes involved energy metabolism (i.e., aconitase, pyruvate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, ATP synthase alpha chain, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase). Cyclosporine treatment (1 micromol/l) abolished preload-induced upregulation proteins. demonstrate first time acute increase myocardial preload causes upregulation metabolic enzymes, thereby increasing capacity myocardium generate ATP production. short-term adaptation enhanced mechanical load appears critically depend calcineurin phosphatase activity.
