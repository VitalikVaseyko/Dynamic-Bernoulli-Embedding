 Pyruvate dehydrogenase pig heart exists active inactive forms. Interconversion active (dephospho) form inactive (phospho) form catalyzed ATP-dependent kinase. Conversely enzyme reactivated phosphatase removes phosphate group protein. gradient centrifugation pyruvate dehydrogenase prepared free phosphatase still containing kinase. Reactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase stimulated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate. incorporation (32)P gamma-(32)P-ATP protein fraction containing phosphatase phosphorylation reaction also stimulated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate. participation phosphate pyruvate dehydrogenase interconversion system suggests that, heart muscle, pyruvate oxidation may hormonal control mechanism similar involved regulation glycogen synthesis breakdown.
