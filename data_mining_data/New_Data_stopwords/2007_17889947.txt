 salicylates (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) detected aquatic environment, studies focused mechanism action pharmaceuticals aquatic organisms. reported previously salicylate disrupted acute trophic hormone-stimulated corticosteroidogenesis rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interrenal tissue vitro. Here, tested hypothesis drug inhibit adaptive plasma cortisol response associated metabolic response acute stressor trout. Fish fed salicylate-laced feed (100 mg/kg body weight) 3 days, subjected acute (5 min) handling disturbance sampled 1, 4 24 h stressor exposure. Salicylate treatment attenuated stressor-induced plasma cortisol glucose lactate elevations. disruption cortisol response corresponded significant reduction transcript levels steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage 11beta-hydroxylase. Salicylate modify stressor-induced elevation brain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression, liver GR protein content reduced. Salicylate impact liver metabolic capacity involved depressed liver glycogen content, whereas significant changes liver hexokinase, glucokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase activities observed. Taken together, salicylate impairs stressor-mediated plasma cortisol response associated liver metabolic capacity trout. mode action salicylate involves disruption StAR liver GR, two key proteins critical cortisol production target tissue responsiveness steroid, respectively.
