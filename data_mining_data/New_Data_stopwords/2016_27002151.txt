 mammals, pyruvate kinase (PK) plays key role regulating balance glycolysis gluconeogenesis; however, vivo regulation PK flux gluconeogenic hormones substrates poorly understood. end, developed novel NMR-liquid chromatography/tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method directly assess pyruvate cycling relative mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism (VPyr-Cyc/VMito) vivo using [3-(13)C]lactate tracer. Using approach, VPyr-Cyc/VMito 6% overnight fasted rats. contrast, propionate infused simultaneously doses previously used tracer, increased VPyr-Cyc/VMito 20-30-fold, increased hepatic TCA metabolite concentrations 2-3-fold, increased endogenous glucose production rates 20-100%. physiologic stimuli, glucagon epinephrine, increased hepatic glucose production, glucagon suppressed VPyr-Cyc/VMito data show fasting conditions, hepatic gluconeogenesis stimulated, pyruvate recycling relatively low liver compared VMito flux liver metabolism, particular pyruvate cycling, sensitive propionate making unsuitable tracer assess hepatic glycolytic, gluconeogenic, mitochondrial metabolism vivo.
