 AIM: evaluate safety long term vas occlusion styrene maleic anhydride (SMA) non-invasive reversal level accessory reproductive glands ARGs langurs. METHODS: morphology seminal vesicle ventral prostate evaluated light well transmission electron microscopy. Serum clinical chemistry urine albumin evaluated autoanalyzer using reagent kits. Fructose, acid phosphatase zinc seminal plasma evaluated spectrophotometrically according manual. Serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen sperm antibodies evaluated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using reagent kits hematology estimated according standard procedures. RESULTS: morphological features secretory activity seminal vesicle prostate normal evidenced presence well-developed mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies, secretory granules normal nuclear characteristics throughout course investigation. Serum testosterone prostate specific antigen remained unaltered serum antisperm antibodies level presented negative titres. Urine albumin nil. Total red blood corpuscles (RBC), white blood corpuscles (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb) red cell indices, serum protein, glucose, cholesterol, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), serum glutamate oxalate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, urea, triglycerides high-density lipoprotein (HDL) show appreciable changes following vas occlusion non-invasive reversal. Although fructose, acid phosphatase (ACP) zinc seminal plasma showed significant reduction following vas occlusion, could related morphology seminal vesicle prostate. CONCLUSION: SMA vas occlusion non-invasive reversal damage accessory reproductive organs.
