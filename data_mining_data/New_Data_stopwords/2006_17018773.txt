 Fiber type specificity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphatase (PDP) determined fed (CON) 48-h food-deprived (FD) rats. PDP activity isoform protein content determined soleus (slow-twitch oxidative), red gastrocnemius (RG; fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic), white gastrocnemius (WG; fast-twitch glycolytic) muscles. normalized mitochondrial volume, difference PDP activity muscle types CON FD. expressed per gram wet tissue weight, PDP activity higher RG compared soleus WG CON FD rats. PDP activities CON muscles 1.48 +/- 0.19, 2.68 +/- 0.65, 1.20 +/- 0.33 nmol x min(-1) x g wet tissue wt(-1) soleus, RG, WG, respectively, decreased FD muscles (1.22 +/- 0.22, 2.00 +/- 0.57, 0.84 +/- 0.18 nmol x min(-1) x g wet tissue wt(-1)). correlated increased PDP2 protein, however, RG, PDP2 detectable soleus WG. PDP1 protein responsive food deprivation fiber types. conclusion, PDP activity protein content higher fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic muscles CON FD rats, identifying unique inter- intramuscular distribution. FD induced small significant decrease PDP activity partially due decreases PDP2 protein. result, coordinate changes PDP activity opposite regulatory enzyme, PDH kinase, food deprivation would maximize inactivation skeletal muscle PDH enhance carbohydrate conservation periods limited carbohydrate supply.
