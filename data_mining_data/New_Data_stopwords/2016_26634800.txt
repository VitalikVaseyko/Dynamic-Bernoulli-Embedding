 Glycometabolism, particularly mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) glycolysis, plays central role cell life activities. Glycometabolism reprogrammed maintain stemness induce differentiation stem cells, thereby regulating tissue repair regeneration. However, research glycometabolism human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) remains scarce. Here, investigated relationship glycometabolic reprogramming initiation hDPSC differentiation. found differentiation hDPSCs commenced day 3 cells cultured mineralized medium. cell differentiation commenced, mitochondria became elongated well-developed cristae, oxygen consumption rate mitochondria enhanced, manifested increase basal respiration, mitochondrial ATP production, maximal respiration. Interestingly, glycolytic enzyme activities, glycolysis capacity, glycolysis reserve also upregulated time match powerful bioenergetic demands. importantly, hDPSCs derived different donors cultured various oxygen environments showed similar glycometabolic changes began differentiate. Thus, glycometabolic reprogramming accompanies initiation hDPSC differentiation could potentially play role regulation dental pulp repair.
