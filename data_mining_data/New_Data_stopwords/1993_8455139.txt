 Exposure rat cortical neurons human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coat protein gp120 vitro causes rise intracellular Ca2+ level subsequent translocation protein kinase C (PKC) cytosol membrane. translocation persists least 2 h, cultures media depleted endogenous glutamate. Enzymatic degradation glutamate medium enzyme glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) abolishes long-lasting effect gp120 association state PKC; incubation condition translocation period < 1 h. Memantine ganglioside GM1 prevent N-methyl D-aspartate receptor-mediated long-term translocation PKC gp120-mediated neurotoxicity (in absence GPT); effect short-term translocation PKC. suggest gp120-caused neuronal death involves indirect sensitization step NMDA receptors, ultimately induces neuronal death.
