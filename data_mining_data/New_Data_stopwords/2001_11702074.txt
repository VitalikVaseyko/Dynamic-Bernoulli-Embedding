 hyperthermophilic, sulfate-reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus strain 7324, rather type strain VC16, found grow starch sulfate energy carbon source. Fermentation products enzyme activities determined starch-grown cells compared cells grown lactate sulfate. exponential growth starch, 1 mol glucose-equivalent incompletely oxidized sulfate approximately 2 mol acetate, 2 mol CO2 1 mol H2S. Starch-grown cells contain measurable amounts deazaflavin factor F420 (<0.03 nmol/mg protein) thus show F420-specific green-blue fluorescence. contrast, lactate (1 mol) completely oxidized sulfate 3 mol CO2 strain 7324, lactate-grown cells contained high amounts F420 (0.6 nmol/mg protein). extracts starch-grown cells, following enzymes modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway detected: ADP-dependent hexokinase (ADP-HK), phosphoglucose isomerase, ADP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (ADP-PFK), fructose-1,6-phosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (GAP:FdOR), phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase (PK). Specific activities ADP-HK, ADP-PFK, GAP:FdOR, PK significantly higher starch-grown cells lactate-grown cells, indicating induction enzymes starch catabolism. Pyruvate conversion acetate involved pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase. findings indicate archaeal sulfate reducer A. fulgidus strain 7324 converts starch acetate via modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming). first report growth sulfate reducer starch, i.e. polymeric sugar.
