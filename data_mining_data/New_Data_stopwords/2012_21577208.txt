 Akt, also known protein kinase B, central role various signaling pathways regulate cellular processes metabolism, proliferation survival. stimulation, phosphorylation activation loop (A-loop) hydrophobic motif (HM) Akt kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) mammalian target rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), respectively, results Akt activation. well-conserved threonine turn motif (TM) also constitutively phosphorylated mTORC2 contributes stability Akt. role TM phosphorylation HM A-loop phosphorylation sufficiently evaluated. Using starfish oocytes model system, study provides first evidence TM phosphorylation negative role A-loop phosphorylation. system, maturation-inducing hormone, 1-methyladenine, stimulates Akt reinitiate meiosis activation cyclin B-Cdc2. phosphorylation status Akt monitored via introduction exogenous human Akt (hAkt) starfish oocytes. TM HM phosphorylation inhibited microinjection anti-starfish TOR antibody, rapamycin treatment, suggesting phosphorylation events depend TORC2, reported mammalian cells. single double alanine substitution three phosphorylation residues revealed TM phosphorylation renders Akt susceptible dephosphorylation A-loop. A-loop phosphatase inhibited okadaic acid (OA), TM phosphorylation still reduced A-loop phosphorylation, suggesting effect caused least partially reduction sensitivity PDK1. Negative regulation TM phosphorylation also observed constitutively active Akt functionally reflected meiosis resumption. contrast, HM phosphorylation enhanced A-loop phosphorylation achieved full activation Akt via mechanism least partially independent TM phosphorylation. observations provide new insight mechanism controlling Akt phosphorylation cell.
