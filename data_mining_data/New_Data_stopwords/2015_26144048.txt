 human DEAD/H-box RNA helicase gene DDX6 target t(11;14)(q23;q32) chromosomal translocation observed human B-cell lymphoma, overexpression protein shown cause malignant transformation. DDX6 variety functions translation initiation, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome assembly, more. However, details regulatory mechanism DDX6 functions DDX6 cancer cells largely unknown. hand, Warburg effect well-known feature cancer cells. Pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM), rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, 2 isoforms, PKM1 PKM2. frequently reported PKM2 tumor-specific isoform promotes Warburg effect. However, functions PKM1 gene hardly mentioned. Here, showed DDX6 overexpressed colorectal cancer specimens regulated microRNA (miR)-124 colon cancer cells. Also, DDX6/c-Myc/PTB1 positive feedback circuit regulated miR-124 shown established contribute maintenance Warburg effect. Moreover, showed knockdown DDX6 induced mainly apoptosis imbalance PKM gene expression, especially causing down-regulation PKM1 colon cancer cells. results suggest miR-124 fine tuner Warburg effect DDX6 one key molecules Warburg effect-related miR-124 targeting various genes.
