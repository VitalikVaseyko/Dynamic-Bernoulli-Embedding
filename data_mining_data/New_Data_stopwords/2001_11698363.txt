 Biochemical studies Azoarcus sp. strain demonstrated anaerobic oxidation toluene m-xylene initiated addition aromatic hydrocarbon fumarate, forming benzylsuccinate 3-methyl benzylsuccinate, respectively. Partially purified benzylsuccinate synthase previously shown catalyze addition reactions. study, identified sequenced genes encoding benzylsuccinate synthase Azoarcus sp. strain examined role enzyme anaerobic toluene m-xylene mineralization. Based reverse transcription-PCR experiments transcriptional start site mapping, found structural genes encoding benzylsuccinate synthase, bssCAB, together two additional genes, bssD bssE, organized operon order bssDCABE. bssD believed encode activating enzyme, similar function pyruvate formate-lyase activase. bssE shows homology tutH Thauera aromatica strain T1, whose function currently unknown. second operon upstream bssDCABE divergently transcribed contains two genes, tdiS tdiR. predicted amino acid sequences show similarity sensor kinase response regulator proteins prokaryotic two-component regulatory systems. chromosomal null bssA mutant constructed (the bssA gene encodes alpha-subunit benzylsuccinate synthase). bssA null mutant strain unable grow denitrifying conditions either toluene m-xylene, growth benzoate unaffected. growth phenotype DeltabssA mutant could rescued reintroducing bssA trans. results demonstrate benzylsuccinate synthase catalyzes first step anaerobic mineralization toluene m-xylene.
