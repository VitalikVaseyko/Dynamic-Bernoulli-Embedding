 well known exercise major impact substrate metabolism many hours exercise. However, regulatory mechanisms increasing lipid oxidation facilitating glycogen resynthesis post-exercise period unknown. address this, substrate oxidation measured prolonged exercise following 6 h post-exercise 5 -AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha2 alpha1 knock-out (KO) wild-type (WT) mice free access food. Substrate oxidation similar exercise relative intensity genotypes. post-exercise recovery, lower lipid oxidation (P < 0.05) higher glucose oxidation observed AMPKalpha2 KO (respiratory exchange ratio (RER) = 0.84 +/- 0.02) WT AMPKalpha1 KO (average RER = 0.80 +/- 0.01) without genotype differences muscle malonyl-CoA free-carnitine concentrations. similar increase muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA expression WT AMPKalpha2 KO observed following exercise, consistent AMPKalpha2 deficiency affecting exercise-induced activation PDK4 transcriptional regulators HDAC4 SIRT1. Interestingly, PDK4 protein content increased (63%, P < 0.001) WT remained unchanged AMPKalpha2 KO. accordance lack increase PDK4 protein content, lower (P < 0.01) inhibitory pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E1alpha Ser(293) phosphorylation observed AMPKalpha2 KO muscle compared WT. findings indicate AMPKalpha2 regulates muscle metabolism post-exercise inhibition PDH complex hence glucose oxidation, subsequently creating conditions increased fatty acid oxidation.
