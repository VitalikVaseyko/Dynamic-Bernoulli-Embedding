 cDNA clone selected candidate catalytic subunit phospho-pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) screening Zea mays expressed sequence tag database bovine PDP deduced amino acid sequence. strands cDNA completely sequenced. maize clone contains open reading frame 1098 base pairs encodes polypeptide 40 127 Da, ZMPP2. deduced amino acid sequence ZMPP2 contains five PP2C signature domains, PDP. However, expression pattern ZMPP2, determined reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, different maize pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Additionally, predicted subcellular location ZMPP2 cytoplasmic, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, regulated reversible phosphorylation, mitochondrial. Thus, ZMPP2 PP2C-type protein phosphatase related distinct PDP.
