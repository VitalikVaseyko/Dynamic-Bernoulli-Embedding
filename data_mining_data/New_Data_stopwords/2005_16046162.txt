 present study investigated changes carbohydrate metabolism eggs whitefish, Coregonus spp. embryogenesis (unfertilized eggs embryos eyed stage). Occurrence glycolysis proved activities phosphofructokinase (PFK-1) pyruvate kinase decreasing levels hexose, pentose phosphate pathway transaldolase (non-oxidative path) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities (oxidative path) increasing ribose levels, fructose synthesis (polyol pathway) sorbitol dehydrogenase activities, gluconeogenesis activities glucose-6-phosphatase. Glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway highest activities epiboly stage, gluconeogenesis epiboly stage eyed embryo stage. Coregonus spp. eggs contained hexoses, ketoses, 6-deoxyhexoses, heptoses uronic acids hexoses, ketoses, 6-deoxysugars occurring free bound form. Hexoses found highest quantities, followed ketoses, 6-deoxyhexoses. Levels compounds changed specific way embryogenesis. investigated stages embryogenesis, levels ribose, heptose, ketose correlated percentage eyed stage embryos developing fertilized eggs (egg viability). distinct embryonic stages, levels hexoses 6-deoxyhexoses activities glucose-6-phosphatase also correlated egg quality. ascertains importance carbohydrate metabolism developing eggs.
