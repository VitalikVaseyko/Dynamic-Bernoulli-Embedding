 Suspensions enzymatically prepared hepatocytes starved rats separated according buoyant density 12 degrees C linear, isosmotic gradients metrizamide, centrofuged low speed relatively short time. recovery cell protein 86%. Hepatocytes high viability formed single band around 1.10 g/cm3 recovered four density populations (P1-P4) form low high density, respectively. content protein significantly lower population P1, content neutral fat averaged cell size similar various populations. specific activity alanine aminotransferase increased order P1-P4. distribution enzyme within intact liver acinus obtained others indicate partial separation periportal perivenous hepatocytes occurred. activity patterns lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) pyruvate kinase, also known intra acinar distributions, supported conclusion. hepatocytes showed signs shrinkage separation, since retained normal ultrastructure, enzyme activities viability, present technique regarded superior previous procedures hepatocyte separation density. degree separation calculated equation (see Appendix), periportal/perivenous ratio parameters measured density populations obtained. specific activity phosphofructokinase, alcohol dehydrogenase aldehyde dehydrogenase showed differences populations. However, ratio high-Km/low-Km aldehyde dehydrogenase increased order P4-P1.
