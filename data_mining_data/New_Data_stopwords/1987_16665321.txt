 Activities key enzymes Calvin cycle C(4) metabolism, rates CO(2) fixation, initial products photosynthetic (14)CO(2) fixation determined podwall, seed coat (fruiting structures), subtending leaf (leaf receme) Brassica campestris L. cv ;Toria.' Compared activities ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase Calvin cycle enzymes, e.g. NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase ribulose-5-phosphate kinase, activities phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase enzymes C(4) metabolism, viz. NADP-malate dehydrogenase, NADP-malic enzyme, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, generally much higher seed podwall leaf. Podwall leaf comparable other. Pulse-chase experiments showed seed major product (14)CO(2) assimilation malate (in short time), whereas podwall leaf, label initially appeared 3-PGA. time, label moved sucrose. contrast legumes, Brassica pods able fix net CO(2) light. However, respiratory losses high dark period.
