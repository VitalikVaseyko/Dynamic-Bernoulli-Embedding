 Metabolic reprogramming hallmark cellular transformation, yet little known metabolic changes accompany tumor metastasis. show primary breast cancer cells display extensive metabolic heterogeneity engage distinct metabolic programs depending site metastasis. Liver-metastatic breast cancer cells exhibit unique metabolic program compared bone- lung-metastatic cells, characterized increased conversion glucose-derived pyruvate lactate concomitant reduction mitochondrial metabolism. Liver-metastatic cells displayed increased HIF-1alpha activity expression HIF-1alpha target Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1). Silencing HIF-1alpha reversed glycolytic phenotype liver-metastatic cells, PDK1 specifically required metabolic adaptation nutrient limitation hypoxia. Finally, demonstrate PDK1 required efficient liver metastasis, expression elevated liver metastases breast cancer patients. data implicate PDK1 key regulator metabolism metastatic potential breast cancer.
