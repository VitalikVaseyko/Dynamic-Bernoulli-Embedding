 Physiological changes host cell model membranes (intact human erythrocytes ghosts) consequence bacterial adhesion studied special reference Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Membrane activities examined transport K+, Cl- ions, pyruvate kinase, Na-K-dependent ATPase, cAMP. found K+ Cl- transport affected, membranes attached pilated (P+) organisms apilated (P-) isogenic strains. N. gonorrhoeae several species gram-negative bacteria studied, hemagglutination titres directly correlated effects anion transport, suggesting perturbations anion transport immediate result adhesion. three P+ gonococcus strains tested, two depressed Na-K-ATPase activity membrane, indicating possible effect Na-K pump. Pyruvate kinase activity associated membrane appeared stimulated attached gonococci, P+ strains higher levels P- organisms. Clearly, enzyme properties host membranes intrinsically affected bacterial adhesion. Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils also investigated, exceptions, changes observed leukocyte enzyme activities tended parallel erythrocytes. Since hypochlorous acid production considered important microbicidal mechanism neutrophils, interference Cl- transport could jeopardize role host defense.
