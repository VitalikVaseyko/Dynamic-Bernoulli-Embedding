 Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) caused mutations Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH). proposed "pseudohypoxic" stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) fumarate accumulation contributes tumorigenesis HLRCC. hypothesized additional direct consequence FH deficiency establishment biosynthetic milieu. investigate hypothesis, isolated primary mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) lines Fh1-deficient mice. predicted, MEFs upregulated Hif-1alpha HIF target genes directly result FH deficiency. addition, detailed metabolic assessment MEFs confirmed dependence glycolysis, elevated rate lactate efflux, associated upregulation glycolytic enzymes known associated tumorigenesis. Correspondingly, Fh1-deficient benign murine renal cysts advanced human HLRCC-related renal cell carcinoma manifested prominent progressive increase expression HIF-alpha target genes genes known relevant tumorigenesis metastasis. accord hypothesis, variety different FH-deficient tissues, including novel murine model Fh1-deficient smooth muscle, show striking progressive upregulation tumorigenic metabolic profile, manifested increased PKM2 LDHA protein. Based models assessed herein, infer FH deficiency compels cells adopt early, reversible, progressive protumorigenic metabolic milieu reminiscent driving Warburg effect. Targets identified novel diverse FH-deficient models represent excellent potential candidates mechanistic investigation therapeutic metabolic manipulation tumors.
