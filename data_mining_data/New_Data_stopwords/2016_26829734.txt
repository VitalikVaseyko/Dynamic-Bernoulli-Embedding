 OBJECTIVE: evaluate feasibility genetic prenatal diagnosis family affected pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD). METHODS: Targeted sequence capture high-throughput sequencing technology used detect exons exon-intron boundaries PKLR gene clinically suspected PKD patient. Meanwhile, genotype pedigree validated Sanger sequencing. Prenatal genetic diagnosis performed amniotic fluid sampling genotype mother proband determined. RESULTS: proband found harbor double heterozygous mutations, c.661G>A (Asp221Asn) c.1528C>T (Arg510Ter), resulted amino acid substitution Asp221Asn Arg510Ter. mutations confirmed Sanger sequencing. mother father proband detected respectively carried c.1528C>T (Arg510Ter) c.661G>A (Asp221Asn) mutation. fetus found carried mutations proband. Following selected abortion, analysis fetal tissue consistent result prenatal diagnosis. CONCLUSION: compound mutations c.661G>A c.1528C>T PKLR gene probably underlie PKD family. Prenatal diagnosis mutations analysis facilitate detection affected fetus time.
