 Despite evidence suggesting mouse pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency provides protection malaria rodents, investigation parallel protective effect babesiosis caused Babesia rodhaini. Here, examined whether PK-deficient co-isogenic mouse strain (CBA-Pk-1(slc)) protected B. rodhaini infection. demonstrated deficiency pyruvate kinase correlated significant protective effect, survival rates 50%, 58% 56% groups inoculated 10, 10(3) 10(5) parasitized erythrocytes, respectively. contrast, control CBA (CBA-Pk-1(+)) mice exhibited 100% lethality, regardless infectious dose. addition, CBA-Pk-1(slc) mice showed decreased levels parasitemia compared CBA-Pk-1(+) mice, groups given 10, 10(3) 10(5) parasitized erythrocytes. results indicate similar PK deficiency rodents, PK deficiency mice affects vivo growth B. rodhaini protects mice lethal babesiosis.
