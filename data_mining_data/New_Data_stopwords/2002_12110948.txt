 Mutations HNF4alpha gene correlated maturity-onset diabetes young, characterized mainly pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction also associated mild liver abnormalities. HNF4alpha D126Y D126H mutations found patient early-onset type 2 diabetes, R324H mutation found common type 2 diabetic nephropathic patient. investigated whether mutations, yet functionally characterized, impair HNF4alpha function three cell models: HEK 293 embryonal kidney cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, betaTC3 pancreatic beta-cells. R324H mutation effect HNF4alpha function either HNF1alpha L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) promoters, D126Y D126H mutations impaired HNF4alpha transcriptional activities tested cell lines. impairments D126Y D126H mutations, located box, due loss dimerization loss DNA binding. Interestingly, strongest functional consequences mutations observed HNF1alpha promoter betaTC3 cells. Given key role transcription factor HNF1alpha pancreatic beta-cell function, inferred impairment HNF4alpha function mutations affects metabolic pathways pancreatic beta-cells contributes development diabetes. Moreover, HNF4alpha-mediated activation apolipoprotein CIII promoter HepG2 cells significantly impaired D126Y D126H mutations. results support clinical findings liver function also impaired diabetic patients HNF4alpha mutations.
