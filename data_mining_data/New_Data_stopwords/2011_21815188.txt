 Pyruvate kinase deficiency chronic illness age specific consequences. Newborns suffer life-threatening hemolytic crisis hyperbilirubinemia. Adults risk infections asplenia, pregnancy-related morbidity, may suffer organ damage systemic iron overload. describe 27 Old Order Amish patients (ages 8 months-52 years) homozygous c.1436G>A mutations PKLR. subject predictable neonatal course requiring packed red blood cell transfusions (30 +/- 5 mL/kg) control hemolytic disease intensive phototherapy prevent kernicterus. Hemochromatosis affected 29% (n = 4) adult patients, inappropriately normal serum hepcidin (34.5 +/- 12.7 ng/mL) GDF-15 (595 +/- 335pg/mL) relative hyperferritinemia (769 +/- 595 mg/dL). high prevalence HFE gene mutations exists population may contribute iron-related morbidity. Based observations, present strategy long-term management pyruvate kinase deficiency.
