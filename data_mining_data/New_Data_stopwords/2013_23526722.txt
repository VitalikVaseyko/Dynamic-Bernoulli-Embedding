 Brain tissue highly dynamic terms electrical activity energy demand. Relevant energy metabolites turnover times ranging milliseconds seconds rapidly exchanged cells within cells. recently fast metabolic events inaccessible, standard isotopic techniques require use populations cells and/or involve integration times tens minutes. Thanks fluorescent probes recently available genetically-encoded optical nanosensors, Technology Report shows possible monitor concentration metabolites real-time single cells. combination ad hoc inhibitor-stop protocols, probes revealed key role K(+) acute stimulation astrocytic glycolysis synaptic activity. also permitted detection Warburg effect single cancer cells. Genetically-encoded nanosensors currently exist glucose, lactate, NADH ATP, envisaged metabolite nanosensors soon available. optical tools together improved expression systems vivo imaging, herald exciting era single-cell metabolic analysis.
