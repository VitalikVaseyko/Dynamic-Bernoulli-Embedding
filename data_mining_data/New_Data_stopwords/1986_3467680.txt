 ammonium-sulphate fractionation, phosphocellulose column chromatography, isoelectric focusing, pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) purified pig dental pulps yield homogeneous preparation single protein band approx. 63,000 daltons upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. molecular weight enzyme estimated 250,000 Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, tetrameric structure indicated. isoelectric point purified enzyme 8.0; optimal pH, pH 7.2. pH, substrate inhibition enzyme either phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP, relationship reaction velocity substrate concentration well-explained Michaelis-Menten equation. Km values 53 286 microM PEP ADP, respectively. enzyme different catalytic properties pH 8.0: 0.4 mM ADP, kinetic behaviour gave sigmoidal curve respect PEP fructose-1,6-diphosphate acted allosteric activator. 2.0 mM ADP, hyperbolic curve resulted PEP.
