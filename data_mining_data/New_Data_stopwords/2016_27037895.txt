 Hyperglycemia risk factor variety human cancers. Increased access glucose tumor metabolize glucose glycolytic process even presence oxygen (Warburg effect), provide framework analyze particular set metabolic adaptation mechanisms may explain phenomenon. present work, using mammary stromal cell line derived healthy tissue subjected long-term culture low (5 mM) high (25 mM) glucose, analyzed kinetic parameters lactate transport using FRET biosensor. results indicate glucose pre-culture soluble epithelial factors constitute stimulus lactate stromal production, factors also modify kinetic parameters monocarboxylate transporters expression stromal cells. also observed vectorial flux lactate stroma epithelial cells co-culture setting found uptake lactate epithelial cells correlates degree malignancy. Glucose preconditioning stromal cell stimulated epithelial motility. findings suggest lactate generated stromal cells high glucose condition stimulate epithelial migration. Overall, results support notion glucose provides substrate tumor nutrition also behaves signal promoting malignancy. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 136-144, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
