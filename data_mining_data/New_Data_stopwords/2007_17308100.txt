 Cancer cells often fail respond stimuli normally activate intrinsic apoptotic machinery. Moreover, able adapt hypoxia changing glycolytic rate. Pyruvate kinase (PK) rate-limiting enzyme glycolysis converted less active dimer form PKM2 isoenzyme oncogenesis. Here, show somatostatin structural analogue TT-232 interact PKM subtype. show PKM2 translocated nucleus response TT-232 different apoptotic agents. Nuclear translocation PKM2 sufficient induce cell death caspase independent, isoform specific, independent enzymatic activity. results show tumor marker PKM2 plays general role caspase-independent cell death tumor cells thereby defines glycolytic enzyme novel target cancer therapy development.
