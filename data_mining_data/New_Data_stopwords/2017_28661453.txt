 Liver X receptors (LXRalpha/beta) carbohydrate response element-binding proteins (ChREBPalpha/beta) key players transcriptional control hepatic de novo lipogenesis. LXRalpha/beta double knockout (LXRalpha(-/-)/beta(-/-)) mice reduced feeding-induced nuclear O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling, ChREBPalpha activity, lipogenic gene expression livers, suggesting important roles LXRs linking hepatic glucose utilization lipid synthesis. However, role LXRs fructose-induced ChREBP activation lipogenesis currently unknown. study, studied effects high fructose high glucose feeding hepatic carbohydrate metabolism lipogenic gene expression livers fasted (24 h) fasted-refed (12 h) wild type LXRalpha knockout (LXRalpha(-/-)) mice. Hepatic lipogenic gene expression reduced glucose fed, fructose fed LXRalpha(-/-) mice. associated lower expression liver pyruvate-kinase (L-pk) Chrebpbeta, indicating reduced ChREBPalpha activity glucose fed, fructose fed mice. Interestingly, ChREBP binding L-pk promoter increased fructose fed LXRalpha(-/-) mice, concomitant increased glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) expression O-GlcNAc modified LXRbeta, suggesting role LXRbeta regulating ChREBPalpha activity upon fructose feeding. conclusion, propose LXRalpha important regulator hepatic lipogenesis ChREBPalpha activity upon glucose, fructose feeding mice.
