 Ligation splenic artery performed upon six children variety peripheral cytopenias associated hypersplenism decrease splenic hyperfunction preserving splenic tissue. procedure initially improved peripheral blood values five patients--two patients hereditary spherocytosis, one patient idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, one patient pyruvate-kinase hemolytic anemia one patient posthepatitic cirrhosis splenomegaly--the hematologic derangement gradually recurred four, necessitating eventual splenectomy two. sixth patient, infant histiocytosis-x, died soon ligation splenic artery. Scintiscans spleen corroborated regrowth splenic remnant, principally lower pole vascular supply splenocolic ligament interrupted. Although ligation splenic artery safe promptly reduces splenic overreactivity, operation viewed temporizing definitive treatment hypersplenism. hand, view protective function spleen certain bacteria protozoa, particularly children blood dyscrasia, idea achieving eusplenism mild hyposplenism rather asplenism graded reduction functional splenic mass ischemic treatment hypersplenism seems sound. Alternative methods circulatory control, instance, embolization splenic artery, splenic function cautiously pursued.
