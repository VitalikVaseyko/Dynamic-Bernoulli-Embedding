 longest part sperm flagellum, principal piece, contains fibrous sheath, cytoskeletal element unique spermiogenesis. performed mass spectrometry proteomics isolated human fibrous sheaths identifying unique ADP/ATP carrier protein, SFEC [AAC4], seven glycolytic enzymes previously unreported human sperm fibrous sheath, sorbitol dehydrogenase. SFEC, pyruvate kinase aldolase co-localized immunofluorescence principal piece. homology model constructed SFEC predicted unique residues entrance nucleotide binding pocket SFEC absent human ADP/ATP carriers, suggesting opportunities selective drug targeting. study provides first evidence role ADP/ATP carrier family member glycolysis. co-localization SFEC glycolytic enzymes fibrous sheath supports growing literature principal piece flagellum capable generating regulating ATP independently mitochondrial oxidation mid-piece. model proposed fibrous sheath represents highly ordered complex, analogous electron transport chain, adjacent enzymes glycolytic pathway assembled permit efficient flux energy substrates products SFEC serving mediate energy generating energy consuming processes distal flagellum, possibly nucleotide shuttle flagellar glycolysis, protein phosphorylation mechanisms motility.
