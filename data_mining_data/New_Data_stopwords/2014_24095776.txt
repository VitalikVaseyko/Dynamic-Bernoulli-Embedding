 Chromosome 7q36 microdeletion syndrome rare genomic disorder characterized underdevelopment brain, microcephaly, anomalies sex organs, language problems. Developmental delay, intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorders, BDMR syndrome, unusual facial morphology key features chromosome 2q37 microdeletion syndrome. genetic screening two brothers global developmental delay using high-resolution chromosomal analysis subtelomeric multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed subtelomeric rearrangements sites 2q37.2 7q35, reversed deletion duplication. showed dysmorphic facial features, severe disability physical intellectual development, abnormal genitalia differential abnormalities phenotypes. family abnormal genetic phenotypes. According genetic analysis parents, adjacent-1 segregation mother's suggested mechanism gene mutation. comparing phenotypes patients previous reports similar patients, tried obtain information related genes chromosomal locations.
