 L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression modulated hormonal nutritional conditions. Here, show transient transfections hepatocytes primary culture glucose response element contiguous hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) binding site (L3) promoter negative cyclic AMP (cAMP) response elements cAMP-dependent inhibition L3 requires HNF4 binding. Another HNF4 binding site-dependent construct also inhibited cAMP. However, HNF4 mutants whose putative PKA-dependent phosphorylation sites mutated still conferred cAMP-sensitive transactivation L3-dependent reporter gene. Overexpression CREB binding protein (CBP) increased HNF4-dependent transactivation effect remained sensitive cAMP inhibition.
