 Pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) key enzyme C(4) photosynthesis also found C(3) plants. post-translationally modified PPDK regulatory protein (RP) possesses kinase phosphotransferase activities. Phosphorylation dephosphorylation PPDK lead inactivation activation respectively. Arabidopsis thaliana contains two genes encode chloroplastic (RP1) cytosolic (RP2) isoforms RP, although RP1 kinase phosphotransferase activities, date RP2 shown act kinase. demonstrate RP2 able catalyse dephosphorylation PPDK, although slower rate RP1 conditions assay. yeast two-hybrid analysis propose RP1 binds central catalytic domain PPDK, additional regions towards carboxy amino termini required stable interaction RP2 PPDK. 21 highly conserved amino acids RP1, mutation 15 reduced kinase phosphotransferase activity, mutation six residues impact either activity. found mutant one activity abolished. However, chimaeric fusions comprised amino carboxy termini RP1 RP2 respectively, kinase reaction severely compromised phosphotransferase activity remained unaffected. findings consistent findings RP1 RP2 modulate reversibly activity PPDK, possess one bifunctional active site two separate sites close proximity.
