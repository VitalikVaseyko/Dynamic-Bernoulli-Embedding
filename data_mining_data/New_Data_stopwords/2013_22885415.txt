 BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) remains major cause severe brain damage often associated high mortality lifelong disability. Immature brains extremely sensitive HI, shown prolonged mitochondrial neuronal death. Sodium pyruvate (SP), substrate tricarboxylic acid cycle extracellular antioxidant, considered potential treatment hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, effects evaluated appropriate animal models hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. METHODS: investigation used primary cortical neuron cultures derived neonatal rats subjected oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) well-established neonatal rat HI model. RESULTS: HI caused brain tissue loss impaired sensorimotor function spatial memory whereas SP significantly reduced brain damage improved neurological performance. neuroprotective effects SP likely result improved cerebral metabolism demonstrated maintaining adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels preventing increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. SP treatment also decreased levels Bax, death signal immature neurons, blocked caspase-3 activation, activated key survival signaling kinase, Akt, vitro vivo. CONCLUSION: SP protected neonatal brain hypoxic-ischemic injury maintaining cerebral metabolism mitochondrial function.
