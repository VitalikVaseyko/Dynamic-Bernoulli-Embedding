 aqueous media, muscle pyruvate kinase highly selective K+ Na+. studied selectivity pyruvate kinase water/dimethylsulfoxide mixtures measuring activation inhibition constants K+ Na+, i.e. binding monovalent divalent cation binding sites pyruvate kinase, respectively [Melchoir J.B. (1965) Biochemistry 4, 1518-1525]. 40% dimethylsulfoxide K0.5 app K+ Na+ 190 64-fold lower water. Ki app K+ Na+ decreased 116 135-fold 20 40% dimethylsulfoxide. ratios Ki app/K0.5 app K+ Na+ 34-3.5 3.3-0.2, respectively. Therefore, dimethylsulfoxide favored partition K+ Na+ monovalent divalent cation binding sites enzyme. kinetics enzyme subsaturating concentrations activators show K+ Mg2+ exhibit high selectivity respective cation binding sites, whereas Na+ substitutes K+, Na+ Mg2+ bind high affinity incorrect sites. evident ratio affinities Mg2+ K+ monovalent cation binding site, close 200. Na+ Mg2+ ratio approximately 20. Therefore, data suggest K+ induces conformational changes prevent binding Mg2+ monovalent cation binding site. Circular dichroism spectra enzyme magnitude transfer apparent binding energies K+ Na+ indicate structural arrangements enzyme induced dimethylsulfoxide determine affinities pyruvate kinase K+ Na+.
