 Sudden cardiac death (SCD), primarily caused lethal heart disorders resulting structural arrhythmogenic abnormalities, one prevalent modes death developed countries. Myocardial ischemia, mainly due coronary artery disease, common type heart disease leading SCD. However, postmortem diagnosis SCD frequently complicated obscure histological evidence. Here, show certain mRNA species, namely encoding hemoglobin A1/2 B (Hba1/2 Hbb, respectively) well pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), exhibit distinct postmortem expression patterns left ventricular free wall SCD subjects compared expression patterns corresponding tissues control subjects non-cardiac causes death. Hba1/2 Hbb mRNA expression levels higher ischemic SCD cases acute myocardial infarction ischemic heart disease without recent infarction, even cardiac death subjects without apparent pathological signs heart injuries, control subjects. contrast, Pdk4 mRNA expressed lower levels SCD subjects. conclusion, found altered myocardial Hba1/2, Hbb, Pdk4 mRNA expression patterns employed molecular signatures fatal cardiac dysfunction forensically implicate SCD primary cause death.
