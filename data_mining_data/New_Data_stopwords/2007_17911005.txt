 aim study clarify mechanisms related plasma glucose concentration mice fed diet rich n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs). Male Crlj:CD-1 (ICR) mice fed experimental diets containing 6% lard (LD), 6% fish oil (FO) 4.1% lard plus 1.5% docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester 0.4% eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (DE) 12 weeks. marked differences plasma glucose insulin concentration changes glucose tolerance test three dietary groups. end feeding trial, plasma glucose concentration significantly lower fasted mice FO group LD group (P<.005). Plasma adiponectin concentration significantly higher FO group LD group (P<.05). Hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities skeletal muscle tended lower FO group LD group, differences glucokinase phosphofructokinase activities liver three dietary groups. However, hepatic glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity 53-fold 4.2-fold higher FO group LD DE groups, respectively (P<.0005 P<.05, respectively). results suggest reduction plasma glucose concentration mice fed n-3 PUFAs mainly caused acceleration glucose uptake glycerol synthesis liver rather skeletal muscle.
