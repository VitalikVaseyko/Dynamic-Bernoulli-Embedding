 tumor development switch glycolytic metabolism known Warburg effect may provide cancer cells survival advantage may also provide therapeutic opportunity. number signals contribute aerobic glycolysis including mediated HIF-1, c-Myc, Akt Hexokinase. Recent studies implicated p53 tumor suppressor negative regulator switch. Using inducible p53 gene silencing bioluminescent tumor xenografts initially observed qualitatively similar levels FDG uptake PET small animal imaging wild-type p53-expressing tumor xenografts p53 gene-silenced xenografts. evaluated glucose uptake using FDG-PET/CT fusion imaging green red fluorescently-labeled wild-type p53-null human colon tumor xenografts. results demonstrate wild-type p53-expressing tumor xenografts exhibit high levels glucose uptake, similar observed p53-null tumor xenografts, quantitative PET imaging indicative glycolytic switch. Thus p53 function sufficient suppress glucose uptake cells tumors could theoretically support aerobic glycolysis.
