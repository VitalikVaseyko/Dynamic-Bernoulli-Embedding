 Pyruvate kinase (PK) critical regulation glycolytic pathway. regulatory properties Escherichia coli investigated mutating six charged residues involved interdomain salt bridges (Arg(271), Arg(292), Asp(297), Lys(413)) binding allosteric activator (Lys(382) Arg(431)). Arg(271) Lys(413) located interface C domains within one subunit. R271L K413Q mutant enzymes exhibit altered kinetic properties. K413Q, partial enzyme activation, whereas R271L characterized bias toward T-state allosteric equilibrium. T-state, Arg(292) Asp(297) form intersubunit salt bridge. mutants R292D D297R totally inactive. crystal structure R292D reveals mutant enzyme retains T-state quaternary structure. However, mutation induces reorganization interface creation network interactions similar observed crystal structures R-state yeast M1 PK proteins. Furthermore, R292D structure, two loops part active site disordered. K382Q R431E mutations designed probe binding site fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate, allosteric activator. R431E exhibits slight changes regulatory properties. Conversely, K382Q displays highly altered responsiveness activator, suggesting Lys(382) involved activator binding allosteric transition mechanism. Taken together, results support notion domain interfaces critical allosteric transition. couple changes tertiary quaternary structures alterations geometry fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate substrate binding sites. site-directed mutagenesis data discussed light molecular basis hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, caused mutations human erythrocyte PK gene.
