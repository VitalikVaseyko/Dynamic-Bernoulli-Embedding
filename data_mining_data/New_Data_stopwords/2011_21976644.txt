 Warburg effect abnormal glycolysis response associated cancer cells. present evidence metabolic changes resembling Warburg effect induced nonmammalian virus. shrimp infected white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), changes induced several metabolic pathways related mitochondria. viral genome replication stage (12 h postinfection [hpi]), glucose consumption plasma lactate concentration increased WSSV-infected shrimp, key enzyme pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), showed increased activity. also found 12 hpi alteration ADP/ATP ratio oxidative stress lower uninfected controls. results characteristic Warburg effect present mammals. also significant decrease triglyceride concentration starting 12 hpi. late stage infection cycle (24 hpi), hemocytes WSSV-infected shrimp showed several changes associated cell death. included induction mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP), increased oxidative stress, decreased glucose consumption, disrupted energy production. previous study showed WSSV infection led upregulation voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), known involved Warburg effect MMP. show double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) silencing VDAC reduces WSSV-induced mortality virion copy number. results, hypothesize model depicting metabolic changes host cells early late stages WSSV infection.
