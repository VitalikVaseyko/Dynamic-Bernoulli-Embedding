 normal heart, leptin modulates cardiac metabolism. unknown, however, effect leptin cardiac metabolism outcomes acute myocardial infarction (MI). study performed test hypothesis leptin signaling increases glucose metabolism attenuates injury acutely infarcted heart. Mice (ObR(+/+)) without (ObR(-/-)) cardiomyocyte specific expression leptin receptor (ObR) randomly assigned experimental MI sham procedure, studied 3 days later. ObR(+/+) ObR(-/-) sham mice significantly different measured outcome. However, MI, ObR(-/-) mice greater cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular dilation, levels oxidative stress. worse indices cardiac injury ObR(-/-) mice associated attenuated signal transducer activator transcription (STAT) 3, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Akt signaling, decreased malonyl CoA content, reduced mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase electron transport Complex I, II IV activities. Furthermore, ObR(-/-) mice maintained high rates cardiac fatty acid oxidation MI, whereas ObR(+/+) mice demonstrated switch away fatty acid oxidation glucose metabolism. Restoration cardiac STAT3, PI3K Akt activity mitochondrial function ObR(-/-) mice post-MI accomplished ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), established STAT3 activator, administered immediately MI. Moreover, CNTF therapy resulted mitigation cardiac structural functional injury, attenuated levels oxidative stress, rescued glucose metabolism infarcted ObR(-/-) heart. data demonstrate impaired cardiac leptin signaling results metabolic inflexibility glucose utilization face cardiac stress, greater morbidity MI. Further, studies show cardiac glucose metabolism restored leptin-resistant hearts CNTF-mediated activation survival kinases, resulting multiple improved structural functional outcomes post-MI.
