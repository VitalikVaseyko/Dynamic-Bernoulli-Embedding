 Lactic acidosis occurs orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), especially anhepatic early postreperfusion phases. Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, indirectly activating mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase. This, turn, markedly reduces systemic lactate production and, lesser extent, increases hepatic lactate uptake. result moderation lactic acidosis many clinical conditions. study evaluated efficacy DCA controlling lactic acidosis OLT improving perioperative outcome OLT. informed consent, 250 patients OLT received either intraoperative DCA placebo. DCA (40 mg/kg intravenously) placebo administered anesthesia induction repeated 4 hours later. Intraoperative measures arterial blood gases, lactate, Na+ utilization blood products, CaCl2, NaHCO3. Outcome measures time tracheal extubation, intensive care unit length stay, hospital length stay, requirement postoperative plasma transfusion, retransplantation, perioperative mortality. DCA reduced arterial lactic acid concentration average 44% (1.8 mmol L(-1), P < 0.001), stabilized acid-base balance, reduced NaHCO(3) administration 80% (P < 0.001). Postoperatively, DCA-treated patients required 50% less postoperative plasma transfusion (2 versus 4 units, respectively, P = 0.016), incidence transfusion similar groups (62% versus 60%, P = 0.381). DCA alter time extubation, intensive care unit length stay, hospital length stay. conclusion, DCA attenuated lactic acidosis OLT, stabilizing intraoperative acid-base balance decreasing NaHCO3 use. DCA decreased postoperative plasma transfusion requirement otherwise measurable effect perioperative outcome parameters.
