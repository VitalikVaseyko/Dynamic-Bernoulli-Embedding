 full time courses important metabolites glycolysis human erythrocytes reported following pH-shifts pH 7.4 8.1 8.1 6.9. regulatory enzymes affected pH-transitions identified computer simulation using mathematical model erythrocyte glycolysis. concluded transition pH 8.1 hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system activated pyruvate kinase inhibited. pH 6.9 hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system bisphosphoglycerate mutase inhibited whereas non-glycolytic ATP-consuming processes seem activated.
