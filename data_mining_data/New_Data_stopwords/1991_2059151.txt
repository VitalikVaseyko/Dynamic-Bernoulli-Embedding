 Male Sprague-Dawley rats (240-245 g) dosed ip 5, 15, 25, 125 micrograms/kg -,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) corn oil. Ad libitum-fed pair-fed controls received vehicle (4 ml/kg) alone. Two 8 days dosing five rats group sacrificed, livers removed assayed activities three gluconeogenic enzymes [phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32), pyruvate carboxylase (PC; EC 6.4.1.1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase, EC 3.13.9)], one glycolytic enzyme [pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40)] established procedures. activity PK affected TCDD either time point. activity G-6-Pase tended decreased TCDD-treated animals, compared pair-fed controls, decrease variable without apparent dose-response. activity PEPCK significantly decreased 2 days dosing, clear dose-response apparent 8-day time point. Maximum loss activity highest dose 56% pair-fed control levels. PC activity slightly decreased 2 days TCDD treatment displayed statistically significant, dose-dependent reduction 8 days dosing 49% loss enzyme activity highest dose. concluded inhibition gluconeogenesis TCDD previously demonstrated vivo probably due decreased activities PEPCK PC. data also support prevailing view PEPCK PC rate-determining enzymes gluconeogenesis.
