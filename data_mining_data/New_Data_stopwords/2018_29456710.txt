 present study aimed investigate effect goniothalamin apoptosis induction A375 melanoma cell line. Melanoma type skin cancer increased prevalence potential standard treatment. Goniothalamin plant, bioactive styrly-lactone, various bioactivities including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory anti-cancer. Apoptosis induction goniothalamin studied numerous cancer cell lines, however melanoma cell line A375. results MTT assay demonstrated goniothalamin induced anti-proliferation dose dependent manner. Hoechst staining assay demonstrated goniothalamin induced chromatin condensation apoptotic bodies A375 treated cells, JC-1 staining revealed goniothalamin induced mitochondrial membrane dysfunction A375 cells. addition, goniothalamin decreased level anti-apoptotic proteins myeloid cell leukemia 1, B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 Bcl-extra large, whereas increased level pro-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 Associated X, apoptosis regulator, t-BID Bim A375 treated cells. addition, goniothalamin also increased active caspase-9, -7 cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase expression A375 treated cells. Furthermore, phosphorylated (p)-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1 (Ser241) p-RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt; Ser473) decreased, however c-Jun p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 increased upon goniothalamin treatment. results suggest goniothalamin effect, anti-proliferation apoptosis induction A375 cells associated upregulated p-ERK1/2, c-Jun downregulated p-PDK1 (Ser241), p-Akt (Ser473) A375 cells. Therefore, goniothalamin may potential candidate anti-cancer drug development melanoma treatment.
