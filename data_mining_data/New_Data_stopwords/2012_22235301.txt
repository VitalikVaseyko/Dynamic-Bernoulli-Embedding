 BACKGROUND: multitude articles published diversity journals providing information genes, proteins, pathways, diseases. article investigates subsets biological process, gain insight functioning system whole, must integrate information multiple publications. Particularly, unraveling relationships extra-cellular inputs downstream molecular response mechanisms requires integrating conclusions diverse publications. METHODOLOGY: present automated approach biological knowledge discovery PubMed abstracts, suitable "connecting dots" across literature. describe storytelling algorithm that, given start end publication, typically little overlap content, identifies chain intermediate publications one other, neighboring publications significant content similarity. quality discovered stories measured using local criteria size supporting neighborhoods link strength individual links connecting publications, well global metrics dispersion. ensure story stays coherent meanders one publication another, demonstrate design novel coherence overlap filters use post-processing steps. CONCLUSIONS: DEMONSTRATE APPLICATION STORYTELLING ALGORITHM THREE CASE STUDIES: i) many-one study exploring relationships multiple cellular inputs molecule responsible cell-fate decisions, ii) many-many study exploring relationships multiple cytokines multiple downstream transcription factors, iii) one-to-one study showcase ability recover cancer related association, viz. Warburg effect, past literature. storytelling pipeline helps narrow scientist's focus several hundreds thousands relevant documents around hundred stories. argue approach serve valuable discovery aid hypothesis generation connection exploration large unstructured biological knowledge bases.
