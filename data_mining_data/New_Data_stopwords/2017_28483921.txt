 Disruption Gys2 gene encoding liver isoform glycogen synthase generates mouse strain (LGSKO) almost completely lacks hepatic glycogen, impaired glucose disposal, pre-disposed entering fasted state. study investigated lack liver glycogen increases fat accumulation development liver insulin resistance. Insulin signaling LGSKO mice reduced liver, muscle, suggesting organ-specific defect. Phosphorylation components hepatic insulin-signaling pathway, namely IRS1, Akt, GSK3, decreased LGSKO mice. Moreover, insulin stimulation phosphorylation significantly suppressed, temporally insulin dose response. Phosphorylation insulin-regulated transcription factor FoxO1 somewhat reduced insulin treatment elicit normal translocation FoxO1 nucleus. Fat overaccumulated LGSKO livers, showing aberrant distribution acinus, increase explained reduction hepatic triglyceride export. Rather, administered orally fasted mice, glucose directed toward hepatic lipogenesis judged activity, protein levels, expression several fatty acid synthesis genes, namely, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, SREBP1c, chREBP, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase. Furthermore, using cultured primary hepatocytes, found lipogenesis increased 40% LGSKO cells compared controls. note, hepatic insulin resistance associated increased levels pro-inflammatory markers. results suggest loss liver glycogen synthesis diverts glucose toward fat synthesis, correlating impaired hepatic insulin signaling glucose disposal.
