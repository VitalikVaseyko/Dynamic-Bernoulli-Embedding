 Improvements understanding metabolic cross-talk cancer microenvironment expected lead novel therapeutic approaches. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells increased mitochondria compared nonmalignant CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, contrary Warburg hypothesis, AML relies oxidative phosphorylation generate adenosine triphosphate. report human AML, NOX2 generates superoxide, stimulates bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) AML blast transfer mitochondria AML-derived tunneling nanotubes. Moreover, inhibition NOX2 able prevent mitochondrial transfer, increase AML apoptosis, improve NSG AML mouse survival. Although mitochondrial transfer BMSC nonmalignant CD34(+) cells occurs response oxidative stress, NOX2 inhibition detectable effect nonmalignant CD34(+) cell survival. Taken together, identify tumor-specific dependence NOX2-driven mitochondrial transfer novel therapeutic strategy AML.
