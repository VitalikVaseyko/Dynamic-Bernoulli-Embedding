 Several low virulent Candida albicans mutant strains: CM1613 (deleted Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase MKC1), CNC13 (deleted MAP-kinase HOG1) morphological mutant 92' used vaccines employing murine model systemic candidiasis. vaccination trial, CNC13 strain able induce protection subsequent infection lethal dose wild-type strain. protection induced CNC13 vaccinated animals resulted 60-70% percent survival. results demonstrate collaboration cellular humoral responses, induced CNC13 mutant, elicited long lasting effective protection. Using proteomic approach (two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed Western blotting), twenty-five C. albicans immunogenic proteins detected identified matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and/or tandem mass spectrometry. able define antibody pattern sera nonvaccinating strains (92' CM1613), different profile detected sera surviving animals (vaccinated CNC13 mutant). utility proteomic approach allowed us identify antigens induce protective IgG2a antibody isotype sera vaccinated animals: enolase (Eno1p), pyruvate kinase (Cdc19p), pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc11p), component 40S ribosomal subunit (Bel1p), triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi1p), DL-glycerol phosphatase (Rhr2p), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba1p) two new protective antigens: IMP dehydrogenase (Imh3p), acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs2p). antigenic proteins promote protective antibodies described work excellent candidates future fungal vaccine; heterologous expression vaccine design currently underway.
