 Incubation isolated hepatocytes fasted rats 20 mM LiCl 1 h decreased glucose production lactate, pyruvate, alanine. addition, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene expression FTO-2B rat hepatoma cells inhibited treatment LiCl. Lithium also able counteract increased PEPCK mRNA levels caused Bt2cAMP dexamethasone, concentration-dependent manner. chimeric gene containing PEPCK promoter (-550 +73) linked amino-3-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo) structural gene transduced FTO-2B cells using Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus. infected cells, 20 mM LiCl decreased concentration neo mRNA transcribed PEPCK-neo chimeric gene mRNA endogenous PEPCK gene. Lithium also inhibited stimulatory effect Bt2cAMP dexamethasone genes. stability neo mRNA altered lithium, since cells infected retrovirus containing neo gene transcribed via retroviral 5'-LTR treated 20 mM LiCl, change neo mRNA levels observed. intraperitoneal administration LiCl rats caused decrease hepatic PEPCK mRNA, indicating lithium could also modify gene expression vivo. effects lithium due increase concentration insulin blood correlated increase hepatic glycogen fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. results indicate lithium ions, concentrations normally used therapeutically depression humans, inhibit glucose synthesis liver mechanism selectively modify expression hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.
