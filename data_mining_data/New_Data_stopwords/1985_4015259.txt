 Muscular glycolytic fuels, intermediates end-products (glycogen, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate), Krebs cycle intermediates (citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate), related free amino acids (glutamate, alanine), ammonia, energy store (creatine phosphate), energy mediators (ATP, ADP, AMP) energy charge potential evaluated. Furthermore maximum rate (Vmax) following muscular enzyme activities evaluated crude extract and/or mitochondrial fraction: anaerobic glycolytic pathway: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; tricarboxylic acid cycle: citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase; electron transfer chain: total NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome oxidase. rat gastrocnemius muscles analyzed normoxia repeated, alternate hypoxic normoxic exposures (12 hours hypoxia daily; 5 days). Naftidrofuryl administered daily three different doses: 10, 15 22.5 mg/kg i.m., 30 min beginning experimental hypoxia. biochemical adaptation intermittent normobaric hypoxic-normoxic exposures characterized decrease muscular contents creatine phosphate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate glutamate. adaptation occurred absence significant changes Vmax muscle enzymes tested. naftidrofuryl treatment, gastrocnemius muscle hypoxic rats alpha-ketoglutarate creatine phosphate contents maintained normal values, glutamate concentration remained reduced subnormal values. exception hexokinase, naftidrofuryl treatment modify Vmax marker enzymes related energy transduction.
