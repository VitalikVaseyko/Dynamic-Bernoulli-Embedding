 BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) leading cause death globally, atherosclerosis main cause. Main risk factors known current effort much dedicated improve prevention. However, asymptomatic silent course atherosclerosis hampers accurate individualized risk evaluation. OBJECTIVES: investigate subjacent molecular changes taking place arterial tissue ultimately translated measurable fingerprint plasma. METHODS: First, applied combined approach find main molecular alterations protein metabolite level response early atherosclerosis development rabbit model. potential reflection alterations observed aortic tissue investigated rabbit plasma analyzed translational study human plasma 62 individuals. RESULTS: Data link structural remodeling taking place atherosclerotic arteries terms loss contractile properties favored cellular migration, up-regulation integrin linked kinase, tropomyosin isoform 2 capping protein gelsolin-like, down-regulation vinculin. molecular response oxidative stress evidenced, involving changes glucose metabolism enzymes pyruvate kinase (PKM) phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), pyruvate. Up-regulation aspartate connects different changes observed amino acid metabolism and, additionally, alterations phosphatidylcholine route glycerophospholipid metabolism found. CONCLUSIONS: specific molecular marker panel composed PKM, valine pyruvate shown linked cardiovascular risk.
