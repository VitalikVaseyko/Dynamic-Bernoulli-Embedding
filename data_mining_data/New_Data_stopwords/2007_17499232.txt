 OBJECTIVE: aim investigate regulation glucose fatty acid metabolism cardiomyocytes globular (gAd) full-length (fAd) forms adiponectin. METHODS: produced fAd (consisting high, medium low molecular weight oligomers) mammalian expression system gAd bacteria. used treat primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (up 48 h), employed 3H- 14C-labeled substrates monitor glucose uptake subsequent metabolism via oxidation, glycogen synthesis lactate production fatty acid uptake oxidation. Enzymatic assay acetyl CoA carboxylase activity employed, protein phosphorylation expression determined immunoblotting cell lysates. role adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) isoforms determined via siRNA-mediated knockdown. RESULTS: initial (1 h) increase glucose uptake oxidation response gAd fAd. Fatty acid uptake stimulated gAd fAd, 24 h decrease acetyl CoA carboxylase activity elevated fatty acid oxidation observed. 48 h increased fatty acid oxidation correlated decreased glucose oxidation pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, glycogen synthesis lactate production increased. gAd fAd elicited phosphorylation AMP kinase, insulin receptor substrate-1, Akt glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Knockdown AdipoR1 AdipoR2 attenuated effect gAd fAd fatty acid uptake oxidation. AdipoR1 knockdown prevented ability gAd (1 h) increase glucose uptake oxidation; however, reducing either AdipoR1 AdipoR2 expression attenuated long-term (24 h) effects gAd. CONCLUSIONS: results clearly demonstrate gAd fAd mediate distinct time-dependent effects cardiomyocyte energy metabolism via AdipoR1 AdipoR2.
