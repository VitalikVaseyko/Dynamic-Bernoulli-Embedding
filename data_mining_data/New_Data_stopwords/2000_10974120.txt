 Mortierella alpina, fungus used commercially source arachidonic acid, 20:4(n-6), examined see growth lipid-based carbon sources leads repression either fatty acid biosynthesis and/or fatty acid desaturation elongation. Changes activities ATP:citrate lyase, isocitrate lyase, carnitine acetyltransferase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase fungus grown fatty-acid-based (Tween) carbon sources consistent (i) cells using fatty acyl portion substrate sole carbon source, (ii) pyruvate kinase source pyruvate biosynthesis conditions (iii) malic enzyme's major function provider NADPH lipid biosynthesis. abolition fatty acid synthase activity cells grown Tweens indicated cessation de novo fatty acid biosynthesis conditions. fatty acyl composition lipid accumulated fungus grown Tweens 20, 40 80 showed desaturation elongation substrate lipid still occurred. absolute amount arachidonic acid synthesized Tween-grown cells cells grown glucose. transformation incorporated fatty acids 20:4(n-6) was, appeared, limited elongation 18:3(n-6) 20:3(n-6) as, every case, 18:1, 18:2 18:3(n-6) increased amount Tween-grown cells. data show first time fatty acid synthesis regulated separately fatty acid desaturation/elongation latter reactions repressed growth fungus simple fatty acids. Furthermore, data strongly implicate elongation 18:3(n-6) 20:3(n-6) limiting step arachidonic acid biosynthesis Mort. alpina.
