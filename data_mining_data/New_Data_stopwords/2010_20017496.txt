 metabolism cancer cells altered support rapid proliferation. Pharmacological activators tumor cell specific pyruvate kinase isozyme (PKM2) may approach altering classic Warburg effect characteristic aberrant metabolism cancer cells yielding novel antiproliferation strategy. manuscript, detail discovery series substituted N,N'-diarylsulfonamides activators PKM2. synthesis numerous analogues evaluation structure-activity relationships presented well assessments mechanism selectivity. Several agents found good potencies appropriate solubility use chemical probes PKM2 including 55 (AC(50) = 43 nM, maximum response = 84%; solubility = 7.3 microg/mL), 56 (AC(50) = 99 nM, maximum response = 84%; solubility = 5.7 microg/mL), 58 (AC(50) = 38 nM, maximum response = 82%; solubility = 51.2 microg/mL). small molecules described represent first-in-class activators PKM2.
