 BACKGROUND: primary purpose study investigate significance pretreatment glycemic parameters prognosis head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: Plasma samples 71 patients untreated HNSCC obtained time diagnosis. prognostic value fasting insulin, glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin levels, homeostatic model risk assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) evaluated toward disease-free survival. RESULTS: High HOMA-IR levels associated poor disease-free survival intermediate-advanced stage tumors. Kaplan-Meier curves showed lower disease-free survival rates patients high HOMA-IR patients low levels. patients intermediate-advanced stage tumors, multivariate analysis revealed HOMA-IR >2.974 presented 2.7 times higher risk poor outcome (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.023-7.341; P = .045). CONCLUSION: HOMA-IR independently associated disease-free survival patients HNSCC. found optimal HOMA-IR cutoff value disease-free survival patients intermediate-advanced HNSCC.
