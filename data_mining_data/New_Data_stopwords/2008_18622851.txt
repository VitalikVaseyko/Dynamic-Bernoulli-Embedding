 present study examined possible role reactive oxygen species pathogenesis heart failure broilers. Data collected three groups birds various risk heart failure: Leghorn chickens (resistant heart failure), slow-growing feed-restricted broilers (low risk heart failure), fast-growing ad libitum fed broilers (high risk heart failure), broilers congestive heart failure (CHF). first part study, basic clinical parameters ultrastructural changes examined context lipid peroxidation ventricular myocardium. followed study vitro changes activity selected cytosolic enzymes (creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase) mitochondrial enzymes (pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) presence oxidants (hydrogen peroxide tertiary butyl hydroperoxide). distinctive clinical feature fast-growing broilers broilers CHF compared slow-growing broilers Leghorn chickens significantly lower heart rate (P <0.05). Electron microscopy revealed marked morphological changes myocardial mitochondria broilers (i.e. fast-growing broilers broilers CHF). level malondialdehyde equivalents, indicator lipid peroxidation subsequent generated oxidative stress, significantly higher (P <0.05) ad libitum fed broilers highest (P <0.01) broilers CHF. vitro, presence oxidants detrimental effect creatine kinase alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity increased. activity pyruvate dehydrogenase altered oxidants. results indicate deterioration heart function fast-growing commercial broilers experimental model associated oxidative stress leading lipid peroxidation cellular mitochondrial membranes, decreased activity myocardial creatine kinase alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase enzymes critical energy synthesis transformation pathways.
