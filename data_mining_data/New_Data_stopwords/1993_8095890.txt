 1. Glycogen accumulated liver rats given histidine-excess diet. 2. order know regulatory point, activities eight hepatic key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism measured feeding either basal histidine-excess diet 0, 3 7 days. 3. active glycogen synthase level 2.6- 3.0-fold higher feeding 3 7 days, respectively, total activity enzyme affected feeding 3 days increased feeding 7 days. 4. active glycogen phosphorylase, glucose 6-phosphatase pyruvate kinase activities significantly decreased, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity increased histidine-excess diet 3 days. 5. Thus, enzymatic changes, mainly enhancement active glycogen synthase might lead substantial accumulation hepatic glycogen. 6. vivo incorporation radioactive glucose liver glycogen stimulated rats given histidine-excess diet.
