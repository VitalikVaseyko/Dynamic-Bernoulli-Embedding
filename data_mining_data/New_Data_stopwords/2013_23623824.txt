 Pfkfb (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) enzymes bi-functional enzymes encoded four different genes (pfkfb1, pfkfb2, pfkfb3, pfkfb4) vertebrates. involved regulation glycolysis: catalyze synthesis degradation F-2,6-BP (fructose-2,6-bisphosphate), potent allosteric activator phosphofructokinase 1 (Pfk1), key glycolytic enzyme. producing F-2,6-BP, Pfkfb enzymes allow glycolysis proceed, degrading F-2,6-BP block glycolysis. major regulators glycolysis, Pfkfb enzymes involved cancer: tumor cells higher glycolytic rate compared normal cells, even presence adequate oxygen levels (Warburg effect) several cancer cell lines express elevated levels Pfkfb enzymes. Glycolysis also important energy metabolite production proliferating cells. embryos, however, role glycolysis expression glycolysis regulators remain explored. Here, provide phylogenetic analysis Pfkfb enzymes vertebrates, detail expression pattern pfk1, pfkfb1, pfkfb2, pfkfb3, pfkfb4 genes Xenopus laevis embryos. show pfkfb transcripts expression overlapping blastula gastrula stages neurulation tadpole stages, display tissue-specific, complementary dynamic expression patterns.
