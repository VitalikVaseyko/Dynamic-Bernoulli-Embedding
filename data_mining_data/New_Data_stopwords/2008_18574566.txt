 low-energy nitrogen ion beam implantation technique used breeding mutant D(-)-lactic-acid-producing strains. wild strain Sporolactobacillus sp. DX12 mutated N(+) ion beam energy 10keV doses ranging 0.4 x 10(15) 6.60 x 10(15) ions/cm(2). Combined efficient screening method, efficient mutant Y2-8 selected two times N(+) ion beam implantation. using mutant Y2-8, 121.6g/l D-lactic acid produced molar yields 162.1% glucose. yield D-lactic acid strain Y2-8 198.8% higher wild strain. Determination anaerobic metabolism Biolog MT2 used analyze activities concerned enzymes lactic acid metabolic pathway. results showed activities key enzymes responded substrates 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, D-lactate dehydrogenase considerably higher mutants wild strain. might affected ion beam implantation.
