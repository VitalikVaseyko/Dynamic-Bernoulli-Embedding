 endocannabinoids, recently discovered endogenous, lipid derived, signaling system regulating energy metabolism, effects central peripheral energy metabolism predominantly via cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). CB1 expressed centrally hypothalamus nucleus accumbens peripherally adipocytes skeletal muscle. study determined effect endocannabinoids expression genes regulating energy metabolism human skeletal muscle. Primary cultures myotubes (lean obese; n=3/group) treated cannabinoid receptor agonist, anandamide (AEA) (0.2 5microM) CB1 specific antagonist AM251 (0.2 5microM) separately combination 24h. expression mRNA AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha 1 (alpha1) alpha 2 (alpha2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) determined using 'Real Time' RT-PCR. AMPKalpha1 mRNA increased lean obese myotubes response AM251 (P<0.05). AEA inhibited effect AM251 AMPKalpha1 mRNA levels myotubes lean obese subjects (P<0.05); dose-response curve shifted left obese. response AM251, irrespective presence AEA, PDK4 expression decreased lean obese myotubes (P<0.05). Taken together data suggest endocannabinoids regulate pathways affecting skeletal muscle oxidation, effects particularly evident myotubes obese individuals.
