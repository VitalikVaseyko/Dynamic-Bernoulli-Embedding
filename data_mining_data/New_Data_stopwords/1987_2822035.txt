 Rat hearts perfused 32Pi made hypoxic perfusion medium gassed N2/CO2 (19:1). rapid decrease tension development (25% control within 40 s), little change frequency contraction, time peak tension, rate relaxation. phosphorylation troponin-I, C-protein myosin P-light chain unaffected 5 min hypoxia, whereas proportions glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate dehydrogenase active form increased slowly. aerobically perfused hearts challenged bolus (70 pmole) D,L-isoprenaline, large increase contractile force, cyclic AMP concentration, phosphorylation troponin-I C-protein activation phosphorylase pyruvate dehydrogenase. Hypoxia 5 min caused slight, progressive decrease response isoprenaline force, cyclic AMP activation phosphorylase pyruvate dehydrogenase. contrast, larger decrease phosphorylation troponin-I C-protein, suggesting activity cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase towards contractile proteins may impaired hypoxia. phosphorylation myosin P-light chain unaltered condition. response hypoxia compared ischaemia, complete loss response isoprenaline occurs 5 min.
