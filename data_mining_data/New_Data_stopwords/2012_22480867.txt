 cell's reaction change endogenous exogenous conditions often involves complex response eventually either leads cell adaptation survival initiation execution (programmed) cell death. molecular decision whether live die, depending cell's genome, fundamentally influenced actual metabolic status. Thus, collection metabolites present biological system certain time point (the so-called metabolome) defines physiological, developmental pathological state determines fate changing stressful conditions. budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae unicellular organism allows easily modify monitor conditions affecting cell's metabolome, instance simple change nutrition source. changes used mimic study (patho)physiological scenarios, including caloric restriction longevity, Warburg effect cancer cells changes mitochondrial mass affecting cell death. addition, disruption single genes generation respiratory deficiency (via abrogation mitochondrial DNA) assists revealing connections metabolism apoptosis. minireview, discuss recent studies using potential yeast model provide new insights processes stress defense, cell death longevity.
