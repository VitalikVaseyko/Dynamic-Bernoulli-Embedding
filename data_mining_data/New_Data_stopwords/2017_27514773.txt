 Glycolysis observed predominant process cancer cells utilize glucose, referred "Warburg Effect". Targeting critical enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inversely regulating process glycolysis could promising approach work alone combination treatments cancer therapy. EGFR inhibitors Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) treatment applied decades clinical practices great success, also clinical benefits somewhat hampered rising acquired-resistance. Combination drug therapy effective strategy cope challenge. study, utilized Dichloroacetate (DCA), widely regarded PDK inhibitor, together Erlotinib Gefitinib, two well-known EGFR inhibitors, demonstrated applications DCA combination either Erlotinib Gefitinib significantly attenuated viability EGFR mutant NSCLC cells (NCI-H1975 NCI-H1650) synergistic manner. synergistic outcome appears combination effect promoting apoptosis, rather co-suppression either EGFR PDK signaling pathways. Moreover, shown combination treatment exhibit synergistic effect NSCLC cell lines without EGFR mutations (A549 NCI-H460). Together, observations suggested combined targeting EGFR PDK NSCLC cells exerted synergistic effects EGFR mutation-dependent fashion.
