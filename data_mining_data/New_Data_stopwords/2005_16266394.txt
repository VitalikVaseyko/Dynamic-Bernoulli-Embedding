 aim work study effect nitric oxide acrosome reaction (AR) participation protein kinases reactive oxygen species AR cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa. Spermatozoa capacitated Tyrode's albumin lactate pyruvate medium heparin (10 IU ml(-1)) incubated different concentrations sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (1-200 micromol l(-1)). Methylene blue haemoglobin used confirm role nitric oxide inducer AR. participation protein kinase (PKA) , protein kinase C (PKC) protein tyrosine kinase evaluated using specific inhibitors enzymes (H-89, 50 micromol l(-1); bisindolylmaleimide I, 0.1 micromol l(-1) genistein, 3 micromol l(-1)). role hydrogen peroxide superoxide anion evaluated incubation catalase superoxide dismutase respectively. AR percentages determined fluorescence technique chlortetracycline. highest levels AR obtained capacitated spermatozoa treated 5-200 micromol l(-1) SNP (24.8 +/- 1.8%). presence PKA, PKC protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors likewise decreased AR percentages. addition superoxide dismutase effect AR level catalase completely blocked it. results indicate nitric oxide induces AR capacitated spermatozoa involving hydrogen peroxide participation PKA, PKC protein tyrosine kinase part signal transduction mechanism lead AR cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa.
