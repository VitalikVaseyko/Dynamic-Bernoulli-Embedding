 study evaluated cytosolic P(i) independent regulator cardiac adenosine formation dissociating changes P(i) changes AMP ADP. Myocardial high-energy phosphates (HEP), measured (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, depleted acutely perfusing isolated guinea pig hearts 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), effects 2-DG compared norepinephrine infusion producing similar changes HEP. 2-DG treatment resulted lower adenosine release (R(ado)) (54 +/- 18 vs. 622 +/- 199 pmol x min(-1) x g(-1)) P(i) concentration ([P(i)]) (0.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 6.0 +/- 0.9 mM) norepinephrine despite similar AMP concentration ([AMP]). Chronic phosphocreatine depletion produced beta-guanidinopropionic acid feeding also reduced R(ado) P(i) hypoxia. Replacement perfusate glucose pyruvate acetate increased R(ado) (from 39 +/- 12 356 +/- 100 pmol x min(-1) x g(-1)) [P(i)] (from 2.0 +/- 0.5 5.1 +/- 0.6 mM) change cytosolic [AMP]. Adenosine kinase isolated guinea pig hearts inhibited [P(i)] values seen hypoxia hypoperfusion. conclude cytosolic [P(i)] important regulator cardiac adenosine formation inhibition adenosine kinase.
