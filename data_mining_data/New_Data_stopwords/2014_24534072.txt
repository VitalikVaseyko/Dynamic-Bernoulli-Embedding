 mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) multi-component mitochondrial enzyme plays key role conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA connecting glycolysis citric acid cycle. Recent studies indicate targeting regulation PDC enzymatic activity might offer therapeutic opportunities inhibiting cancer cell metabolism. facilitate drug discovery area, well defined PDC sample needed. Here, report new method producing functional, recombinant, high quality human PDC complex. five components co-expressed cytoplasm baculovirus-infected SF9 cells deletion mitochondrial localization signal sequences components E1a FLAG-tagged facilitate purification. protein FLAG tagged E1a complex purified using FLAG-M2 affinity resin, followed Superdex 200 sizing chromatography. E2 E3BP components Lipoylated using enzyme based vitro process. resulting PDC 90% pure homogenous. non-phosphorylated, lipoylated human PDC demonstrated produce robust detection window used develop enzyme coupled assay PDHK.
