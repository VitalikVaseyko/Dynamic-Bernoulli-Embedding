 Sedimentation velocity studies presence absence inert space-filling solute, sucrose, used establish preexistence isomerization equilibrium responsible allosteric behavior rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. Whereas inclusion phenylalanine (5 mM) enzyme gives rise decrease 0.3 sedimentation coefficient pyruvate kinase, corresponding effect phosphoenolpyruvate increase sedimentation coefficient 0.03 S. Consideration findings signify existence isomeric equilibrium compact expanded forms enzyme substantiated finding inclusion sucrose (0.1 M) also brings change sedimentation coefficient effected phosphoenolpyruvate. demonstrating rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase undergoes isomerization absence substrate, study removes necessity consider existence isomerization equilibrium substrate-induced; thereby provides experimental support adoption Monod model allostery interpret enzyme kinetic data pyruvate kinase [R.
