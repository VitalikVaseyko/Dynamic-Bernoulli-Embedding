 Cancer cells undergo genetic changes allowing adaptation environmental changes, thereby obtaining advantage long metastatic route, disseminated several changes surrounding environment. particular, plasticity cell motility, mainly due epigenetic regulation cancer cells environmental insults, engage adaptive strategies aimed essentially survive hostile milieu, thereby escaping adverse sites. review focused tumor microenvironment collection structural cellular elements promoting plasticity adaptive programs. analyze role extracellular matrix stiffness, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, acidity, well different cell populations tumor microenvironment.
