 High-throughput screening (HTS) standard approach used pharmaceutical industry identify potential drug-like lead molecules. analysis linking biological data molecular properties major goal academic pharmaceutical research. paper presents Bayesian analysis high-dimensional descriptor data using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations learning classification trees novel method pharmacophore ligand discovery. use experimentally determined binding affinity data protein pyruvate kinase train assess model averaging algorithm apply large database 3.7 million molecules. compare results number variations central Bayesian theme two Neural Network (NN) architectures Support Vector Machines (SVM). main Bayesian algorithm, addition achieving high specificity sensitivity, also lends naturally classifying test sets missing data providing ranking classified compounds. approach used select rank potential biologically active compounds could provide powerful tool compound testing.
