 1. metabolism L-[U-14C]aspartate, L-[1-14C]aspartate L-[4-14C]aspartate studied isolated guinea-pig kidney tubules. 2. Oxidation C-1 plus C-4 aspartate accounted 90-92% CO2 released aspartate, whereas oxidation inner carbon atoms aspartate (which occurs beyond 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase step) represented 8-10% aspartate carbon oxidation. 3. formation [1-14C]glutamine [1-14C]glutamate [1-14C]aspartate [4-14C]aspartate indicated one-third oxaloacetate synthesized aspartate underwent randomization level fumarate. 4. [U-14C]aspartate substrate, percentage C-1 glutamate glutamine found radiolabelled 60 min incubation 92.7% 47.5% absence presence bicarbonate respectively. 5. CO2 fixation occurred high rates presence bicarbonate demonstrated incubating tubules aspartate plus [14C]bicarbonate; condition, label fixed found C-1 glutamate, glutamine aspartate, well C-4 aspartate, demonstrating randomization aspartate carbon also aspartate resynthesis secondary oxaloacetate cycling via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase pyruvate carboxylase. 6. importance CO2 fixation glutamine synthesis aspartate discussed relation possible role guinea-pig kidney systemic acid-base regulation vivo.
