 Carbon destined lysine synthesis Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 21799 diverted toward threonine overexpression genes encoding feedback-insensitive homoserine dehydrogenase (hom(dr)) homoserine kinase (thrB). studied effects introducing two different threonine dehydratase genes threonine-producing system gauge effects isoleucine production. Co-expression hom(dr), thrB, ilvA, encodes native threonine dehydratase, caused isoleucine accumulate final concentration 2.2+/-0.2 g l(-1), five-fold accumulates wild-type strain, approximately twice much accumulates strain expressing hom(dr) thrB. Comparing data previous results, found overexpression three genes, hom(dr), thrB, ilvA, C. glutamicum ATCC 21799 better terms isoleucine production expression single gene, tdcB, encoding catabolic threonine dehydratase Escherichia coli. Co-expression hom(dr), thrB, tdcB, however, caused concentration isoleucine increase 20-fold compared wild-type strain, four times corresponding ilvA-expressing strain. system, apparent yield isoleucine production multiplied factor two [2.1 mmol (g dry cell weight)(-1)]. balance excreted metabolites showed carbon flow strain completely redirected lysine pathway isoleucine pathway, also showed pyruvate diverted amino acid synthesis.
