 Major storage reserves Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds triacylglycerols (seed oils) proteins. Seed oil content severely reduced regulatory mutant wrinkled1 (wri1-1; At3g54320) double mutant two isoforms plastidic pyruvate kinase (pkpbeta(1)pkpalpha; At5g52920 At3g22960). already biochemically well-characterized mutants studied (13)C metabolic flux analysis cultured developing embryos based comparison respective genetic wild-type backgrounds. mutations, seeds well cultured embryos, oil fraction strongly reduced fractions proteins free metabolites increased. Flux analysis cultured embryos revealed changes nutrient uptakes fluxes biomass well increase tricarboxylic acid cycle activity mutations. wild types plastidic pyruvate kinase (PK(p)) provides pyruvate plastidic fatty acid synthesis, flux PK(p) reduced pkpbeta(1)pkpalpha 43% wild-type value. wri1-1, PK(p) flux even reduced (by 82%), although genes PKpbeta(1) PKpalpha still expressed. Along common paradigm metabolic control theory, hypothesized large reduction PK(p) enzyme activity pkpbeta(1)pkpalpha less effect PK(p) flux multiple smaller reductions glycolytic enzymes wri1-1. addition, wri1-1 mutant large reduction PK(p) flux compensated part increased import cytosolic pyruvate plastidic malic enzyme. limited compensatory bypass could observed pkpbeta(1)pkpalpha.
