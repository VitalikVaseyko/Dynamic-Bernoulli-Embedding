 Mitochondrial protein kinases (mPKs) molecular switches down-regulate oxidation branched-chain alpha-ketoacids pyruvate. Elevated levels metabolites implicated disease states insulin-resistant Type II diabetes, branched-chain ketoaciduria, primary lactic acidosis. report three-dimensional structure member mPK family, rat branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCK). BCK features characteristic nucleotide-binding domain four-helix bundle domain. two domains reminiscent modules found protein histidine kinases (PHKs), involved two-component signal transduction systems. Unlike PHKs, BCK dimerizes direct interaction two opposing nucleotide-binding domains. Nucleotide binding BCK uniquely mediated potassium magnesium. Binding ATP induces disorder-order transitions loop region nucleotide-binding site. structural changes lead formation quadruple aromatic stack interface nucleotide-binding domain four-helix bundle domain, induce movement top portion two helices. Phosphotransfer induces ordering loop region, effectively trapping reaction product ADP, explains product inhibition mPKs. BCK structure prototype mPKs provide framework structure-assisted inhibitor design family kinases.
