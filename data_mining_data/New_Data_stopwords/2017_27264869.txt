 mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) oncoprotein recognized major negative regulator p53 tumor suppressor, growing evidence indicates oncogenic activities extend beyond p53. Here, show MDM2 recruited chromatin independently p53 regulate transcriptional program implicated amino acid metabolism redox homeostasis. Identification MDM2 target genes whole-genome level highlights important role ATF3/4 transcription factors tethering MDM2 chromatin. MDM2 recruitment chromatin tightly regulated process occurs oxidative stress serine/glycine deprivation modulated pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) metabolic enzyme. Depletion endogenous MDM2 p53-deficient cells impairs serine/glycine metabolism, NAD(+)/NADH ratio, glutathione (GSH) recycling, impacting redox state tumorigenic potential. Collectively, data illustrate previously unsuspected function chromatin-bound MDM2 cancer cell metabolism.
