 Addition NH(4) (+) photosynthesizing leaf cells Dolichos lab lab L. var. Lignosis Prain leaf discs Vigna sinensis L. savi ex Hassk caused significant increase flow photosynthetic carbon toward amino acids concomitant decrease toward sugars without affecting over-all photosynthetic rate. Similar diversion photosynthetic carbon away sugars also observed photosynthesizing isolated chloroplasts V. sinensis, latter differed accumulated organic acids rather amino acids. effort understand mechanism NH(4) (+)-mediated regulation, specific total activities NAD(P)-glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, pyruvate kinase, alkaline fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, NAD(P)-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cells D. lab lab checked none affected added ammonium salts even prolonged incubation. certain concentrations, ammonium ions abolished light activation NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase alkaline fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase isolated chloroplasts dark-adapted Vigna leaves without interfering basal dark activity enzymes. Based observations, possible mechanism action NH(4) (+) regulating photosynthetic carbon flow postulated.
