 (1) Rat heart mitochondria, permeabilized low Mr solutes toluene treatment, used study regulation situ phosphatase kinase components pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) Ca2+. (2) Inactivation complex, resulting phosphorylation kinase, reactivation induced phosphatase, apparent first-order processes. behaviour phosphatase differs observed toluene-permeabilized adipose tissue mitochondria (Midgley, P.J.W., Rutter, G.A. Denton, R.M. (1987) Biochem. J. 241, 271-377) 'lag phase' preceded reactivation inactive complex. Further, reactivation due phosphatase activity stimulated Ca2+ subsaturating Mg2+ concentrations, contrast extracted enzyme stimulated Ca2+ Mg2+ concentrations. (3) Maximum values half-times observed inactivation reactivation 10 15 s, respectively, 30 degrees C. (4) Mg2+ concentrations effects Ca2+ activity phosphatase apparent, effect Ca2+ activity kinase could detected. (5) sensitivity phosphatase [Ca2+] essentially unchanged presence either ADP ATP, half-maximal effects 0.7 microM case.
