 Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) RV failure contribute morbidity mortality pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). cause RV dysfunction feasibility therapeutically targeting RV uncertain. hypothesized RV dysfunction electrical remodeling RVH result, part, glycolytic shift myocyte, caused activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). studied two complementary rat models: RVH + PAH (induced monocrotaline) RVH + without PAH (induced pulmonary artery banding (PAB)). Monocrotaline RVH reduced RV O(2)-consumption enhanced glycolysis. RV 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose uptake, Glut-1 expression, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation increased monocrotaline RVH. RV monophasic action potential duration QT(c) interval prolonged due decreased expression repolarizing voltage-gated K(+) channels (Kv1.5, Kv4.2). RV working heart model, PDK inhibitor, dichloroacetate, acutely increased glucose oxidation cardiac work monocrotaline RVH. Chronic dichloroacetate therapy improved RV repolarization RV function vivo RV Langendorff model. PAB-induced RVH, similar reduction cardiac output glycolytic shift occurred improved dichloroacetate. PAB-RVH, benefit dichloroacetate cardiac output approximately 1/3 monocrotaline RVH. larger effects monocrotaline RVH likely reflect dichloroacetate's dual metabolic benefits model: regression vascular disease direct effects RV. Reduction RV function electrical remodeling two models RVH relevant human disease (PAH pulmonic stenosis) result, part, PDK-mediated glycolytic shift RV. PDK inhibition partially restores RV function regresses RVH restoring RV repolarization enhancing glucose oxidation. Recognition PDK-mediated metabolic shift contributes contractile ionic dysfunction RVH offers insight pathophysiology treatment RVH.
