 Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) drives diverse gene expression programs necessary dynamic regulation cancer metastasis, inflammation gluconeogenesis, pointing overlapping roles oncoprotein integrator cell metabolic programs. Nutrient utilization intensely studied regard cellular adaptation cancer noncancerous cells. Nonproliferating cells consume glucose citric acid cycle generate NADH fuel ATP generation via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. contrast, cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming support rapid proliferation. generate lipids, nucleotides, proteins necessary cell division, tumors switch oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, phenomenon known Warburg Effect. SRC-1 key coactivator responsible driving hepatic gluconeogenic program fasting conditions, asked whether SRC-1 responds alterations nutrient availability allow adaptive metabolism. show SRC-1 stabilized 26S proteasome absence glucose. RNA profiling used examine effects SRC-1 perturbation gene expression absence presence glucose, revealing SRC-1 affects expression complex mitochondrial electron transport chain, set enzymes responsible conversion NADH NAD(+). NAD(+) NADH subsequently identified metabolites underlie SRC-1's response glucose deprivation. Knockdown SRC-1 glycolytic cancer cells abrogated ability grow absence glucose consistent SRC-1's role promoting cellular adaptation reduced glucose availability.
