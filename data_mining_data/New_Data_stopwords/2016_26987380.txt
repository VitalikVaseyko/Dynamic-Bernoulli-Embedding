 Apigenin natural flavonoid compound inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha expression cultured tumor cells hypoxic conditions. Hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy always accompanied abnormal myocardial glucolipid metabolism due increase HIF-1alpha. However, whether apigenin may ameliorate cardiac hypertrophy abnormal myocardial glucolipid metabolism remains unknown. study aimed examine effects apigenin. Rats cardiac hypertrophy induced renovascular hypertension treated apigenin 50-100 mg kg(-1) (the doses achieved pharmacological dietary supplementation adult person) gavage 4 weeks. results showed treatment apigenin, blood pressure, heart weight, heart weight index, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, serum angiotensin II, serum myocardial free fatty acids reduced. important note apigenin decreased expression level myocardial HIF-1alpha protein. Moreover, apigenin simultaneously increased expression levels myocardial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)-1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-4 proteins decreased expression levels myocardial PPARgamma, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase genes (GPAT), glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 proteins. findings demonstrated apigenin could improve hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy abnormal myocardial glucolipid metabolism rats, mechanisms might associated down-regulation myocardial HIF-1alpha expression and, subsequently increasing expressions myocardial PPARalpha target genes CPT-1 PDK-4, decreasing expressions myocardial PPARgamma target genes GPAT GLUT-4.
