 Biochemical theory, spectacular growth last half-century, finds experimental basis remarkably organisms. rat, ox, pig, hen plus micro-organisms consitute primary source biochemistry's experimental material, while, contrast, modern systematics estimates bewildering often overlooked diversity 10(6) animal species. result highly limited 'sampling' nature, classical biochemistry supplied equally limited insight far biochemical mechanisms extended adapted (1) allowing organism's exploitation environment (2) accommodating environmental change. situation improved recent years, possible decipher least broad strategic outlines biochemical adaptation environment. essay focuses particular attention influence O2 availability muscle metabolic organization control. drawing examples muscle metabolism spanning range obligate-anaerobic obligate-aerobic organization, possible demonstrate certain kinds metabolic features highly conserved, whereas others changed time time again, different combinations permutations. latter properties constitute 'raw material' adapting metabolism specific O2 regimes, include (1) kinds amounts enzymes present muscle, (2) fine regulatory circuitry allowing controlled transition low high work loads (3) compensation mechanisms adjustment enzyme reactions respect external parameters temperature, pressure, salinity forth. Within inescapable limitations phylogenetic origins time available responding specific environmental conditions, adequate adaptations fundamental design muscle metabolism evolved exploit environments differing greatly O2 availability accommodate wide range muscle functions.
