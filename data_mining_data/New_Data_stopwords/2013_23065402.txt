 aim work investigate glycolysis performance lager ale brewer's yeasts different fermentation temperature using combined analysis metabolic flux, glycolytic enzyme activities, flux control. results indicated fluxes glycolytic pathway decreased change fermentation temperature 15 degrees C 10 degrees C, resulted prolonged fermentation times. maximum activities (V (max)) hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) key nodes glycolytic pathway decreased decreasing fermentation temperature, estimated different control extent (22-84 %) glycolytic fluxes exponential flocculent phase. Moreover, decrease V (max) PFK PK displayed crucial role down-regulation flux flocculent phase. addition, metabolic state ale strain sensitive variation temperature lager strain. results metabolic flux nodes control analysis brewer's yeasts different fermentation temperature may provide alternative approach regulate glycolytic flux changing V (max) improve production efficiency beer quality.
