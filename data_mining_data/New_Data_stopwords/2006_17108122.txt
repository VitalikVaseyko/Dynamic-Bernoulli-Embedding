 "Warburg effect," elevation aerobic glycolysis, may fundamental property cancer cells. cancer diagnosis treatment, would valuable elevated glycolytic metabolism could quantified image animals humans. pyruvate molecule metabolic crossroad energy delivery inside cell, noninvasive measurement relative transformation pyruvate lactate alanine within biologically relevant time frame (seconds), may possible quantify glycolytic status cells. examined metabolism i.v. injection hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate rats implanted P22 tumors. strongly enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance signal generated hyperpolarization techniques allows mapping pyruvate, lactate, alanine 5 x 5 x 10 mm(3) imaging voxel using 1.5 magnetic resonance scanner. magnetic resonance scanning (chemical shift imaging) initiated 24 seconds pyruvate injection duration 14 seconds. implanted tumors showed significantly higher lactate content normal tissue. results indicate noninvasive quantification localized Warburg effect may possible.
