 BACKGROUND: Inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) dichloroacetate (DCA) shift tumor cell metabolism anaerobic glycolysis glucose oxidation, activation mitochondrial activity chemotherapy-dependent apoptosis. radiotherapy, DCA could thus potentially enhance frequently moderate apoptotic response cancer cells results mitochondrial dysfunction. aim study investigate tumor-specific radiosensitization DCA vitro human tumor xenograft mouse model vivo. MATERIALS METHODS: interaction DCA photon beam radiation investigated human tumor cell lines WIDR (colorectal) LN18 (glioma), well human normal tissue cell lines HUVEC (endothelial), MRC5 (lung fibroblasts) TK6 (lymphoblastoid). Apoptosis induction vitro assessed DAPI staining sub-G1 flow cytometry; cell survival quantified clonogenic assay. effect DCA vivo investigated WIDR xenograft tumors growing subcutaneously BALB/c-nu/nu mice, without fractionated irradiation. Histological examination included TUNEL Ki67 staining apoptosis proliferation, respectively, well pinomidazole labeling hypoxia. RESULTS: DCA treatment led decreased clonogenic survival increased specific apoptosis rates tumor cell lines (LN18, WIDR) normal tissue cells (HUVEC, MRC5, TK6). However, significant tumor-specific radiosensitization DCA vitro reflected situation vivo: growth suppression WIDR xenograft tumors irradiation reduced upon additional DCA treatment (reflected Ki67 expression levels), although early tumor cell apoptosis rates significantly increased DCA. apparently paradoxical effect accompanied marked DCA-dependent induction hypoxia tumor-tissue. CONCLUSION: DCA induced tumor-specific radiosensitization vitro vivo. DCA also induced development hypoxia tumor tissue vivo. investigations relating interplay tumor cell metabolism tumor microenvironment necessary explain limited success metabolic targeting radiotherapy.
