 Altered glycolytic flux cancer cells (the "Warburg effect") causes proliferation rely upon elevated glutamine metabolism ("glutamine addiction"). requirement met overexpression glutaminase C (GAC), catalyzes first step glutamine metabolism therefore represents potential therapeutic target. small molecule CB-839 reported potent allosteric GAC inhibitors, including parent compound bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl (BPTES), clinical trials. Recently, described synthesis BPTES analogs distinct saturated heterocyclic cores replacement flexible chain moiety, improved microsomal stability relative CB-839 BPTES. Here, show one new compounds, UPGL00004, like CB-839, potently inhibits enzymatic activity GAC, compared BPTES. also compare abilities UPGL00004, CB-839, BPTES directly bind recombinant GAC demonstrate UPGL00004 similar binding affinity CB-839 GAC. also show UPGL00004 potently inhibits growth triple-negative breast cancer cells, well tumor growth combined anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab. Finally, compare X-ray crystal structures UPGL00004 CB-839 bound GAC, verifying UPGL00004 occupies binding site CB-839 BPTES three inhibitors regulate enzymatic activity GAC via similar allosteric mechanism. results provide insights regarding potency inhibitors useful designing novel small-molecules target key enzyme cancer cell metabolism.
