 Cryptococcus neoformans important fungal pathogen immunocompromised individuals, close relative, Cryptococcus gattii, emerging serious threat immunocompetent. initial infection, C. neoformans colonizes airspaces lungs, resulting pneumonia, subsequently migrates central nervous system (CNS). sought understand fungal carbon utilization colonization fundamentally different niches within host, particular roles gluconeogenesis glycolysis. created mutants key points gluconeogenesis/glycolysis metabolic pathways restricted growth lactate glucose, respectively. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mutant (the pck1Delta mutant), blocked entry 2- 3-carbon substrates gluconeogenesis attenuated virulence murine inhalation model, showed wild-type (WT) persistence rabbit cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) model cryptococcosis. Conversely, pyruvate kinase (pyk1Delta) hexose kinase II (hxk1Delta/hxk2Delta) mutants, show impaired glucose utilization, exhibited severely attenuated virulence murine inhalation model cryptococcosis decreased persistence CNS rabbit CSF murine inhalation models displaying adequate persistence lungs mice. data suggest glucose utilization critical virulence C. neoformans persistence yeast CNS.
