 (Z)-and (E)-phosphoenol-2-ketobutyrate synthesized. [3-2H]-2-Ketobutyrates formed isomers pyruvate kinase reaction 2H2O converted chiral propionates. Authentic (2S)-[2-2H]propionic acid also prepared, optical rotatory dispersion curves propionates compared. rotation compared standard propionate 240 nm sodium (2R)-[2-2H]propionate Z isomer 47% (i.e., 53% RS), (2S)-[2-2H]propionate E isomer 29% (i.e., 71% RS). Protonation C-3 2 si, 3 face pseudosubstrates would yielded (2R)- (2S)-[2-2H]propionates Z E analogues, respectively. explanation offered nonstereoselective protonation occurred dissociation enol enzyme subsequent random protonation solution.
