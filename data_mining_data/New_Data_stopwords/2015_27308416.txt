 Cancer cells undergo reprogramming glucose metabolism limit energy production glycolysis-a state known "aerobic glycolysis." Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1alpha) transcription factor regulates many genes responsible switch. discussed here, new data suggest tumor suppressor WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) modulates HIF1alpha, thereby regulating metabolic state.
