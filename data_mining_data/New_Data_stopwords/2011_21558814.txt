 Recently, proposed new mechanism understanding Warburg effect cancer metabolism. new paradigm, cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, extrude lactate "feed" adjacent cancer cells, drives mitochondrial biogenesis oxidative mitochondrial metabolism cancer cells. Thus, vectorial transport energy-rich substrates fibroblastic tumor stroma anabolic cancer cells. prediction hypothesis cancer-associated fibroblasts express MCT4, mono-carboxylate transporter implicated lactate efflux glycolytic muscle fibers astrocytes brain. address issue, co-cultured MCF7 breast cancer cells normal fibroblasts. Interestingly, results directly show breast cancer cells specifically induce expression MCT4 cancer-associated fibroblasts; MCF7 cells alone fibroblasts alone, failed express MCT4. also show expression MCT4 cancer-associated fibroblasts due oxidative stress, prevented pre-treatment anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. contrast results MCT4, see MCT1, transporter involved lactate uptake, specifically upregulated MCF7 breast cancer cells co-cultured fibroblasts. Virtually identical results also obtained primary human breast cancer samples. human breast cancers, MCT4 selectively labels tumor stroma, e.g., cancer-associated fibroblast compartment. Conversely, MCT1 selectively expressed epithelial cancer cells within tumors. Functionally, show overexpression MCT4 fibroblasts protects MCF7 cancer cells fibroblasts cell death, co-culture conditions. Thus, provide first evidence existence stromal-epithelial lactate shuttle human tumors, analogous lactate shuttles essential normal physiological function muscle tissue brain. data consistent "reverse Warburg effect," states cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, thereby producing lactate, utilized metabolic substrate adjacent cancer cells. model, "energy transfer" "metabolic-coupling" tumor stroma epithelial cancer cells "fuels" tumor growth metastasis, via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism anabolic cancer cells. importantly, current findings provide new rationale novel strategy anti-cancer therapies, employing MCT inhibitors.
