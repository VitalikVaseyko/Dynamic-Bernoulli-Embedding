 Alpha-enolase (ENO1) metabolic enzyme involved synthesis pyruvate. also acts plasminogen receptor mediates activation plasmin extracellular matrix degradation. tumor cells, ENO1 up-regulated supports Warburg effect; expressed cell surface, promotes cancer invasion, subjected specific array post-translational modifications, namely acetylation, methylation phosphorylation. ENO1 overexpression post-translational modifications could diagnostic prognostic value many cancer types. Information biochemical, proteomics immunological characterization ENO1, particularly ability trigger strong specific humoral cellular immune response, make ubiquitous protein interesting tumor target; DNA vaccination ENO1 preclinical models efficiently delays development aggressive tumors pancreatic cancer. review aims analyze main stages tumor associated antigen (TAA) ENO1 become promising target opens potential avenues cancer immunotherapy.
