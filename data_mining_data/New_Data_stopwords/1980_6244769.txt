 study made effects phytohaemagglutinin gene expression glycolytic enzymes cultured human lymphocytes. enzymes found show average increase activity 160% 360% stimulated cells, increases greater enzymes comprising second half pathway. enzyme activities stimulated cells, cultured 72 h, similar activities measured long-term lymphoid lines. Starch-gel electrophoresis used examine isozyme patterns enzymes exposure lymphocytes PHA. Six enzymes showed isozyme patterns unchanged stimulation. Four enzymes, aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, enolase lactate dehydrogenase, showed different isozyme patterns stimulated cells seen uncultured unstimulated cells. electrophoretic results showed good correlation isozyme pattern uncultured lymphocytes cultured unstimulated lymphocytes, PHA-stimulated lymphocytes long-term lymphoid lines.
