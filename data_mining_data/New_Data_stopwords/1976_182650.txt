 animal cells utilization sugars involves one three major pathways known occur cells. glycolytic (Embden-Meyerhof) pathway quantitatively important, pathway, coupled citric acid cycle, serves major source energy. Glycolysis citric acid cycle also provide precursors synthesis proteins, nucleic acids lipids. pentose phosphate, hexose monophosphate oxidation, pathway major source NADPH required conversion carbohydrate reduced lipids proteins, also furnishes ribose deoxyribose moieties nucleotides nucleic acids. functions third pathway, uronic acid pathway, less well defined. source glucuronides mucopolysaccharides detoxification mechanisms, also animals, pathway synthesis ascorbic acid. uronic acid pathway may also function point entry glucuronides, pentoses, pentitols.
