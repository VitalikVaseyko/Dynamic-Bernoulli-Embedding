 Acidosis commonly exists tissue microenvironment various pathophysiological conditions tumors, inflammation, ischemia, metabolic disease, respiratory disease. instance, tumor microenvironment characterized acidosis hypoxia due tumor heterogeneity, aerobic glycolysis (the "Warburg effect"), defective vasculature cannot efficiently deliver oxygen nutrients remove metabolic acid byproduct. acidic microenvironment affects function blood vessels, however, well defined. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) member proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors high expression endothelial cells (ECs). previously reported acidosis induces broad inflammatory response ECs. Acidosis also increases expression several endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response genes CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) ATF3 (activating transcription factor 3). current study, examined acidosis/GPR4- induced ER stress pathways human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) types ECs. three arms ER stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways activated acidosis ECs increased expression phosphorylated eIF2alpha (eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha), phosphorylated IRE1alpha (inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha), cleaved ATF6 upon acidic pH treatment observed. expression downstream mediators UPR, ATF4, ATF3, spliced XBP-1 (X box-binding protein 1), also induced acidosis. genetic pharmacological approaches modulate expression level activity GPR4 HUVEC, found GPR4 plays important role mediating ER stress response induced acidosis. ER stress/UPR cause inflammation cell apoptosis, acidosis/GPR4-induced ER stress pathways ECs may regulate vascular growth inflammatory response acidic microenvironment.
