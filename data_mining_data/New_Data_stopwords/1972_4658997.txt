 1. Isolated rat epididymal fat-cell mitochondria showed inverse relationship ATP content pyruvate dehydrogenase activity consistent competitive inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ADP. constant ATP concentration pyruvate rapidly activated pyruvate dehydrogenase fat-cell mitochondria, observation consistent inhibition fat-cell pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pyruvate. Pyruvate dehydrogenase fat-cell mitochondria also activated nicotinate (100mum) extramitochondrial Na(+) (replacing K(+)) ouabain insulin. 2. rat epididymal fat-pads incubated vitro pyruvate dehydrogenase activated addition insulin absence substrate presence glucose (10mm) fructose (10mm). Glucose fructose activated dehydrogenase absence presence insulin, pyruvate also activated absence insulin. concluded extracellular glucose, fructose pyruvate may activate dehydrogenase raising intracellular pyruvate insulin may activate dehydrogenase mechanism. 3. Ouabain (300mum) medium K(+) replaced Na(+), activated pyruvate dehydrogenase epididymal fat-pads. Prostaglandin E(1) (1mug/ml), 5-methylpyrazole-3-carboxylate (10mum) nicotinate (10mum), effective insulin inhibitors lipolysis like insulin lower tissue concentration cyclic AMP (adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate), activate pyruvate dehydrogenase. Higher concentrations prostaglandin E(1) (10mug/ml) nicotinate (100mum) produced activation dehydrogenase. 4. concluded activation pyruvate dehydrogenase insulin due antilipolytic effect hormone action insulin lowering adipose-cell concentrations cyclic AMP afford obvious explanation effect hormone pyruvate dehydrogenase. possibility effects insulin, ouabain K(+)-free medium may mediated Ca(2+) discussed.
