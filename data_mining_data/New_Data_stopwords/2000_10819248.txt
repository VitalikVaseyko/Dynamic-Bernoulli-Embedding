 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha gene cause type 1 form maturity-onset diabetes young (MODY1). R127W mutation missense mutation located T-box region HNF-4alpha first identified Japanese family MODY. examined functional properties mutation order clarify molecular basis MODY1. METHODS: intracellular localisation, DNA binding ability, transactivation activity functional synergism coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) R127W-HNF-4alpha investigated. RESULTS: nuclear import functional synergy CBP R127W-HNF-4alpha normal. DNA binding ability mutant decreased transcriptional activation HNF-1alpha L-type pyruvate kinase (PKL) genes. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: R127W mutation seems loss-of-function mutation.
