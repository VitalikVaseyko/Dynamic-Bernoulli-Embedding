 31P n.m.r. spectroscopy used study nucleotide kinetics UDP-glucuronyltransferase associated reactions liver microsomal fraction. effects Mg2+ EDTA reactions investigated qualitatively. found rabbit microsomal fraction nucleoside pyrophosphatase activity, UDP immediately hydrolysed released microsomal surface. Reverse glucuronyltransferase could demonstrated. results discussed reference functional coupling UDP-glucuronyltransferase enzymes effects Mg2+ EDTA system.
