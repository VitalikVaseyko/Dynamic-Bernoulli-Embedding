 Two heat-stable protein inhibitors protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), tentatively designated I1PP2A I2PP2A, purified apparent homogeneity extracts bovine kidney. purified preparations I1PP2A exhibited apparent M(r) approximately 30,000 250,000 determined sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel permeation chromatography Sephacryl S-300, respectively. contrast, purified preparations I2PP2A exhibited apparent M(r) approximately 20,000 80,000 determined sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel permeation chromatography Sephacryl S-200, respectively. purified preparations I1PP2A I2PP2A inhibited PP2A 32P-labeled myelin basic protein, 32P-labeled histone H1, 32P-labeled pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, 32P-labeled phosphorylase, protamine kinase substrates. contrast, I1PP2A I2PP2A exhibited little effect, any, activity PP2A 32P-labeled casein, prevent autodephosphorylation PP2A incubations autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase [Guo, H., & Damuni, Z. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 2500-2504]. purified preparations I1PP2A I2PP2A little effect, any, activities protein phosphatase 1, protein phosphatase 2B, protein phosphatase 2C, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. 32P-labeled MBP substrate, kinetic analysis according Henderson showed I1PP2A I2PP2A noncompetitive displayed Ki 30 25 nM, respectively. Following cleavage Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, I1PP2A I2PP2A displayed distinct peptide patterns, indicating inhibitor proteins products distinct genes. N-terminal amino acid sequences purified preparations indicate I1PP2A I2PP2A novel proteins.
