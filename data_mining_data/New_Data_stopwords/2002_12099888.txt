 insulin deficiency, increased lipid delivery oxidation suppress skeletal-muscle glucose oxidation inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity via enhanced protein expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoform 4, phosphorylates (and inactivates) PDC. Signalling via peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) important component mechanism enhancing hepatic renal PDK4 protein expression. Activation PPARalpha gastrocnemius, predominantly fast glycolytic (FG) muscle, also increases PDK4 expression, effect that, extended muscles, would predicted drastically restrict whole-body glucose disposal. Paradoxically, chronic activation PPARalpha WY14,643 treatment improves glucose utilization muscles insulin-resistant high-fat-fed rats. resting state, oxidative skeletal muscles quantitatively important glucose disposal FG muscles. evaluated participation PPARalpha regulating PDK4 protein expression slow oxidative (SO) skeletal muscle (soleus) fast oxidative-glycolytic (FOG) skeletal muscle (anterior tibialis) containing high proportion oxidative fibres. fed state, acute (24 h) activation PPARalpha WY14,643 vivo failed modify PDK4 protein expression soleus, modestly enhanced PDK4 protein expression anterior tibialis. Starvation enhanced PDK4 protein expression muscles, greater response anterior tibialis. WY14,643 treatment vivo starvation enhance upregulation PDK4 protein expression either muscle type. Enhanced PDK4 protein expression starvation retained FOG skeletal muscles PPARalpha-deficient mice. data indicate PDK4 protein expression oxidative skeletal muscle regulated lipid-dependent mechanism obligatorily dependent signalling via PPARalpha.
