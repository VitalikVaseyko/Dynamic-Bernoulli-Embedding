 effect zinc ions carbohydrate metabolism intracellular Zn2+ studied hepatocytes fed rats. addition ZnCl2 medium led almost 3-fold increase lactate production increase net glucose production 50%. Half-maximal rates occurred 40 microM ZnCl2. effects seen Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ 80 microM, whereas Cu2+ 80 microM Cd2+ Pb2+ 8 microM exhibited similar effects 80 microM ZnCl2. Changes intracellular Zn2+ followed single cell epifluorescence using zinquin specific probe. Intracellular free Zn2+ isolated hepatocytes 1.26 +/- 0.27 microM, addition ZnCl2 led concentration-dependent increase epifluorescence. CdCl2 PbCl2 8 microM potent ZnCl2 20-80 microM, whereas NiCl2 80 microM without effect. ZnCl2 completely abolished inhibition glycolysis glucagon (cAMP). Glucagon led pronounced drop cytosolic Zn2+. glucagon zinc stimulated glycogenolysis increasing phosphorylation glycogen phosphorylase acted oppositely glycolysis. Zinc overcame inactivation pyruvate kinase glucagon without changing hormone-induced protein phosphorylation. antagonistic action zinc cAMP glycolysis together rapid marked decrease free zinc concentration induced glucagon (cAMP) may indicate yet unknown role zinc important mediator regulation carbohydrate metabolism.
