 Mycoplasma synoviae isolates differ patterns immunogenic proteins, identified yet. main aim study identification two closely related M. synoviae isolates, ULB 02/P4 ULB 02/OV6, recovered recently chickens Slovenia. N-terminal sequencing identified 17 M. synoviae proteins. Amongst 14 major, highly expressed previously unidentified proteins, including enzymes, chaperones putative lipoproteins. ULB 02/P4 proteins increasing molecular weight (M(w)) region lipoprotein MSPB (approximately 40 kDa) elongation factor EF-Tu, enolase, NADH oxidase, haemagglutinin MSPA, ATP synthase beta chain, trigger factor, pyruvate kinase chaperone DnaK. Enolase (approximately 47 kDa) seemed immunogenic chickens infected M. synoviae, whereas EF-Tu, might cross-react antibodies P1 adhesin Mycoplasma pneumoniae, not. ULB 02/OV6 synthesized several immunogenic proteins M(w) approximately 70, 78, 82, 90, 110 160 kDa, cross-reacted antibodies Mycoplasma gallisepticum. remain identified, besides putative lipoproteins, protein bands 78, 82, 85 110 kDa contained also dehydrogenase PdhD, elongation factor EF-G, enzyme PtsG putative neuraminidase, respectively.
