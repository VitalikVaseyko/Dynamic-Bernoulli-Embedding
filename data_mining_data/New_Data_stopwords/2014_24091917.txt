 Baicalin flavonoid derived root Scutellaria baicalensis exhibits broad spectrum biological activities including anti-adipogenesis. However, inhibitory role baicalin early stage 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation relevant signaling up-stream peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) expression unclear, subject present investigation. used 3T3-L1 preadipocytes adipocyte differentiation, Oil Red-O staining intracellular lipid accumulation assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assaying expression major adipocyte transcription factors. found baicalin markedly suppressed Akt phosphorylation early stage adipocytes differentiation. addition, observed baicalin LY294002 (as inhibitor Akt phosphorylation) significantly inhibited adipocyte differentiation down-regulating several adipocyte-specific transcription factors, including PPAR-gamma C/EBPs 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Furthermore, observed baicalin significantly suppressed Akt phosphorylation inhibiting phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). results indicate anti-adipogenesis effect baicalin involves down-regulation major transcription factors 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation including PPAR-gamma, C/EBP-beta, C/EBP-alpha down-regulation PDK1/Akt phosphorylation.
