 Previously generated inducible liver tumor models transgenic expression Myc xmrk (activated EGFR homolog) oncogenes zebrafish. investigate interaction two oncogenes, crossed two transgenic lines observed severe faster hepatocarcinogenesis Myc/xmrk double transgenic zebrafish either single transgenic fish. RNA-Seq analyses revealed distinct changes many molecular pathways among three types liver tumors. particular, found dramatic alteration cancer metabolism based uniquely enriched pathways Myc/xmrk tumors. Critical glycolytic genes including hk2, pkm ldha significantly up-regulated Myc/xmrk tumors either single oncogene-induced tumors, suggesting potential Warburg effect. RT-qPCR analyses, specific pkm2 isoformin Warburg effect found highly enriched Myc/xmrk tumors Myc xmrk tumors, consistent observations many human cancers Warburg effect. Moreover, splicing factor genes (hnrnpa1, ptbp1a, ptbp1b sfrs3b) responsible generating pkm isoform also greatly up-regulated Myc/xmrk tumors. Pkm2 isoform generally inactive causes incomplete glycolysis favor anabolism tumor growth, treatment Pkm2-specific activator, TEPP-46, demonstrated activation Pkm2 suppressed growth oncogenic liver well proliferation liver cells. Collectively, Myc/xmrk zebrafish model suggests synergetic effect EGFR MYC triggering Warburg effect HCC formation may provide promising vivo model Warburg effect.
