 Glutaminase, converts glutamine glutamate, involved Warburg effect cancer cells. Two human glutaminase genes identified, GLS (GLS1) GLS2. Two alternative transcripts arise glutaminase gene: first, kidney isoform (KGA) glutaminase C (GAC) GLS; and, second, liver isoform (LGA) glutaminase B (GAB) GLS2. GLS1 considered cancer therapeutic target, potential role GLS2 cancer remains unclear. Here, discovered series alkyl benzoquinones preferentially inhibit glutaminase B isoform (GAB, GLS2) rather kidney isoform glutaminase (KGA, GLS1). identified amino acid residues allosteric binding pocket responsible selectivity. Treatment alkyl benzoquinones decreased intracellular glutaminase activity glutamate levels. GLS2 inhibition either alkyl benzoquinones GLS2 siRNA reduced carcinoma cell proliferation anchorage-independent colony formation, induced autophagy via AMPK mediated mTORC1 inhibition. findings demonstrate amino acid sequences selective inhibition glutaminase isozymes validate GLS2 potential anti-cancer target.
