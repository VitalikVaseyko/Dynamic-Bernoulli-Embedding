 lactate anion currently emerging oncometabolite. Lactate, produced exported glycolytic glutaminolytic cells tumors, recycled oxidative fuel oxidative tumors cells. Independently hypoxia, also activate transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) tumor endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis. protumoral activities lactate depend lactate uptake, process primarily facilitated inward, passive lactate-proton symporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1); conversion lactate NAD(+) pyruvate, NADH H(+) lactate dehydrogenase-1 (LDH-1); competition pyruvate alpha-ketoglutarate inhibits prolylhydroxylases (PHDs). Endothelial cells primarily use lactate oxidative fuel but, rather, signaling agent. addition HIF-1, lactate indeed activate transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) cells, mechanism depending PHD inhibition also NADH alimenting NAD(P)H oxidases generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). NF-kappaB activity endothelial cells promotes angiogenesis, NF-kappaB activation tumor cells known stimulate tumor progression conferring resistance apoptosis, stemness, pro-angiogenic metastatic capabilities. study, therefore tested whether exogenous lactate could activate NF-kappaB oxidative tumor cells equipped lactate signaling. report that, precisely oxidative, HeLa SiHa human tumor cells activate NF-kappaB response lactate. Indeed, lactate-derived pyruvate well-known inhibit PHDs cells, found NADH aliments oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) mitochondria rather NAD(P)H oxidases cytosol. data confirmed using oxidative human Cal27 MCF7 tumor cells. new information positions malate-aspartate shuttle key player oxidative metabolism lactate: similar glycolysis aliments OXPHOS pyruvate produced pyruvate kinase NADH produced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), oxidative lactate metabolism aliments OXPHOS oxidative tumor cells pyruvate NADH produced LDH1.
