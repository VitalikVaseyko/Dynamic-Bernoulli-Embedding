 Infection Group Streptococcus (GAS) result immune mediated brain disease characterised spectrum movement psychiatric disorders. previously described anti-neuronal antibodies patients bind restricted group brain antigens molecular weights 40 kDa, 45 kDa (doublet) 60 kDa. aim study define antigens using 2-dimensional electrophoresis ion exchange hydrophobic interaction chromatography, followed mass spectrometry. findings confirmed using commercial antibodies, commercial antigens recombinant human antigens. autoantigens neuronal glycolytic enzymes--NGE (pyruvate kinase M1, aldolase C, neuronal-specific non-neuronal enolase). multifunctional proteins expressed intracellularly neuronal cell surface. neuronal plasma membrane, NGE involved energy metabolism, cell signalling synaptic neurotransmission. Anti-NGE antibodies common 20 unselected post-streptococcal CNS patients compared 20 controls. vitro experiments using cultured neurons showed commercial anti-NGE antibodies induced apoptosis compared blank incubation control anti-HuD antibody. GAS also expresses glycolytic enzymes cell surfaces 0-49% identity human NGE, suggesting molecular mimicry autoimmune cross-reactivity may pathogenic mechanism post-streptococcal CNS disease.
