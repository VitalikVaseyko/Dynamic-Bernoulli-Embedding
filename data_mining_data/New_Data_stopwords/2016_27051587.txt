 mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) crucial point convergence growth factor signalling, metabolism, nutrient status cellular proliferation. mTOR pathway heavily implicated progression many cancers emerging important driver gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Due central role adapting metabolism environmental conditions, mTOR signalling also believed critical development obesity. Recent research delineated excessive nutrient intake promote signalling mTOR pathway possibly evoke changes cellular metabolism could accelerate obesity related cancers. Acting two effector complexes mTORC1 mTORC2, mTOR dictates transcription genes important glycolysis, lipogenesis, protein translation synthesis recently defined central mediator Warburg effect cancer cells. Activation mTOR pathway involved pathogenesis GI malignancies development resistance conventional chemotherapy radiotherapy. use mTOR inhibitors promising therapeutic option many GI malignancies, greatest clinical efficacy seen combination regimens. Recent research also provided insight crosstalk mTOR pathways could potentially expand list therapeutic targets mTOR pathway. review available strategies targeting mTOR pathway GI cancers. discuss current clinical trials established novel mTOR inhibitors, particular focus combinations drugs conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy targeted therapies.
