 Despite numerous studies report glucose derived glycoconjugates antitumor candidates, using mannose sugar motif specific tumor targeting remains less studied. research, two novel mannose-conjugated platinum complexes 4a 4b target Warburg effect designed, synthesized evaluated antitumor activities vitro vivo. Compared oxaliplatin, complexes exhibited substantial enhancement water solubility well excellent comparative cytotoxicity six human cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity assessments Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) down-regulated overexpressed cells platinum accumulation study demonstrated cellular uptake compound 4a regulated GLUT1. particular, 4a induced apoptosis HT29 cells suppressing expression Bcl-2 Bcl-XL, preliminary explained mechanism origin antitumor effect. indicated maximum tolerated dose-finding assay vivo anticancer activity, compound 4a exhibits better safety efficacy profile oxaliplatin. findings study indicate possibility subjecting mannose-conjugated platinum complexes lead compounds preclinical evaluation.
