 Warburg's observation cancer cells exhibit high rate glycolysis even presence oxygen (aerobic glycolysis) sparked debate role glycolysis normal cancer cells. Although established defects mitochondrial respiration cause cancer aerobic glycolysis, advantages enhanced glycolysis cancer remain controversial. Many cells ranging microbes lymphocytes use aerobic glycolysis rapid proliferation, suggests may play fundamental role supporting cell growth. Here, review glycolysis contributes metabolic processes dividing cells. provide detailed accounting biosynthetic requirements construct new cell illustrate importance glycolysis providing carbons generate biomass. argue major function aerobic glycolysis maintain high levels glycolytic intermediates support anabolic reactions cells, thus providing explanation increased glucose metabolism selected proliferating cells throughout nature.
