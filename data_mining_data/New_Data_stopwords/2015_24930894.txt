 Fermentation xylose, major constituent lignocellulose, important expanding sustainable biofuel production. sought better understand effects intrinsic (genotypic) extrinsic (growth conditions) variables optimal gene expression Scheffersomyces stipitis xylose utilization pathway Saccharomyces cerevisiae using set five promoters simultaneously regulate gene. Three-gene (xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH), xylulokinase) eight-gene (expanded non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway enzymes pyruvate kinase) promoter libraries enriched aerobic anaerobic conditions mutant XDH altered cofactor usage. characterization enriched strains, observed (1) differences promoter enrichment three-gene library depending whether pentose phosphate pathway genes included aerobic enrichment; (2) importance selection conditions, aerobically-enriched strains underperform anaerobic conditions compared anaerobically-enriched strains; (3) improved growth rather improved fermentation product yields optimized strains carrying mutant XDH compared wild-type XDH.
