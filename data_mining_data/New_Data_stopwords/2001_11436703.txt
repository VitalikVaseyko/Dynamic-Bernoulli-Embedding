 Rats chronically fed (15 weeks) sucrose-rich diet (SRD) developed hypertriglyceridemia (hyperTg), increased plasma free fatty acids (FFA), impaired glucose homeostasis insulin insensitivity. increase Tg glycogen (Gly) heart muscle also observed. HyperTg altered glucose metabolism could profound effects myocardial glucose utilization. test hypothesis male Wistar rats fed semi-synthetic SRD (w/w: 62.5% sucrose, 8% corn-oil, 17% protein), control group (CD) received semi-synthetic diet, except sucrose replaced starch 90 days. time, hearts animals isolated perfused 30 min presence absence insulin (30 mU/ml). Levels exogenous substrates similar found plasma animal vivo dietary groups (glucose 8.5 mM, palmitate 0.8 mM SRD glucose 5-5 mM, palmitate 0.3 mM CD). absence insulin glucose uptake reduced (40%) lactate release increased (50%) SRD hearts. Glucose oxidation depressed mainly due both, increase PDH kinase decrease 60% PDHa (active form PDHc). Insulin perfusion medium improved glucose uptake. results suggest least two different mechanisms might contribute insulin resistance impaired glucose metabolism perfused hearts dyslipemic SRD fed rats: 1) reduced basal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake utilization 2) increased availability oxidation lipids (low PDHa PDH kinase activities), turn decreased glucose uptake utilization. Thus, experimental model may useful study impaired glucose homeostasis, increased plasma FFA hyperTg could contribute heart tissue malfunction.
