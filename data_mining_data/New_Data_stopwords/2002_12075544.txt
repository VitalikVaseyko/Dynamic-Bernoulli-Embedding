 Extremely high bicarbonate (HCO3-) anion gap values measured two horses calf using Hitachi 911 automated serum biochemistry analyzer. three animals severe muscle disease evidenced markedly increased aspartate aminotransferase creatine kinase activities. Laboratory error suspected source increased HCO3- values calculated blood gas analysis normal. hypothesized increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity pyruvate concentration overwhelmed oxamate LDH inhibitor enzymatic HCO3- assay, resulting consumption NADH falsely elevated spectrophotometric reading. Serum LDH activity markedly increased three patients. attempt reproduce interference vitro, LDH pyruvate added normal bovine serum. Bicarbonate concentration artifactually increased linear, dose-response relationship proportional amount LDH activity sample; addition pyruvate augmented increase. concluded increased serum LDH activity pyruvate concentration secondary severe muscle disease result artifactual increases serum HCO3- values obtained routine enzymatic assay.
