 BACKGROUND: remnant liver extended liver resection susceptible ischemic injury, resulting failure liver regeneration liver dysfunction. present study aimed investigate protective role liver epithelial cells (LEC), liver progenitor cell, hepatocytes ischemia vitro vivo. METHODS: LECs isolated rats cultured hypoxic conditions (2% O(2)). cell viability intracellular ATP levels measured. activation hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) assessed immunofluorescence. expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) measured. Hepatocytes treated SDF-1 LEC-conditioned medium hypoxia, cell viability assessed. Finally, hemorrhagic shock induced rats vivo induction endogenous LECs, liver damage assessed. RESULTS: LECs, hepatocytes, cellular viability intracellular ATP levels maintained, nuclear translocation HIF-1alpha expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 mRNA increased hypoxic culture conditions. LECs express SDF-1, CXCR4 expression increased hepatocytes hypoxia. survival hepatocytes hypoxic condition significantly increased treatment SDF-1 LEC-conditioned medium. protective effect conditioned medium impaired CXCR4 antagonists. vivo induction endogenous LECs suppressed elevation serum AST ALT levels hemorrhage shock ischemia-reperfusion. CONCLUSION: LECs resistant hypoxia protective role hepatocytes hypoxia. results suggest induction endogenous LECs protected liver lethal insults paracrine signaling SDF-1 differentiation parenchymal cells.
