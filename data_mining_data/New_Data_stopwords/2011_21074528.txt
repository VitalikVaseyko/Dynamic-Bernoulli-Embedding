 examined effects lactate enzymatic activity hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK) various mouse tissues. results showed lactate inhibited PFK activity analyzed tissues. inhibitory effect observed skeletal muscle even presence insulin. Lactate directly inhibited phosphorylation PFK tyrosine residues skeletal muscle, important mechanism enzyme activation. Moreover, lactate indirectly inhibited HK activity, resulted cellular redistribution, attributed alterations HK structure. PK activity affected lactate. activity HK PFK directly related glucose metabolism. Thus, conceivable lactate exposure induce inhibition glucose consumption tissues.
