 Verification candidate protein biomarkers necessary step moving initial discovery application. Here, report results verification exercise involving six candidate endometrial cancer biomarkers previously discovered using mass-tagging multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (DeSouza L., et al. J. Proteome Res. 2005, 4, 377-386) cohort 148 patient samples means immunohistochemistry tissue microarray format. panel three best-performing biomarkers, chaperonin 10, pyruvate kinase M2, alpha-1-antitrypsin, achieved sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.93, predictive value 0.90, positive predictive value 0.88 discriminating malignant benign endometrium. ruggedness panel biomarkers verified 2/3-training-set-1/3-test-set cross-validation analysis randomly splitting cohort 10 ways. roles chaperonin 10 pyruvate kinase M2 tumorigenesis confirm credible cancer biomarkers.
