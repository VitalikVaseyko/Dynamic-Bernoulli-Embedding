 Western-type diet (WD) risk factor colorectal cancer, underlying mechanisms poorly understood. investigated interaction WD heterozygous mutation Apc gene adenoma formation metabolic immunological changes histologically normal intestinal mucosa Apc(Min/+) (Min/+) mice. diet used high saturated fat low calcium, vitamin D, fiber folate. number adenomas twofold higher WD mice compared controls, adenoma size, proliferation apoptosis differ. ratio Min wild-type allele higher WD mice, indicating accelerated loss Apc heterozygosity (LOH). Densities intraepithelial CD3epsilon(+) lymphocytes mucosal FoxP3(+) regulatory cells higher WD mice, implying inflammatory changes. Western blot analyses mucosa WD mice showed suppressed activation ERK AKT pathways tendency reduced activation mTOR pathway measured phosphoS6/S6 levels. expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 up-regulated mRNA protein levels. Gene expression analyses showed changes oxidation/reduction, fatty acid monosaccharide metabolic pathways, tissue organization, cell fate regulation apoptosis. Together, results suggest high-risk Western diet primes intestine tumorigenesis synergistic effects energy metabolism, inflammation oxidative stress, culminate acceleration LOH Apc gene.
