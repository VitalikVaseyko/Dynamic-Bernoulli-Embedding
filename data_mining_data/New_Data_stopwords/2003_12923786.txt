 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tenth common cancer although incidence increasing. main clinical problems stem relatively late presentation many patients due often asymptomatic nature illness, relative insensitivity metastatic disease conventional chemotherapy radiotherapy. Despite increasing knowledge genetic changes underlying sporadic renal cancer involving Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene, many underlying pathophysiological changes ill-defined remains need identification disease markers use diagnosis prognosis potential therapeutic targets. study used proteomic approach, based two-dimensional gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry, compare protein profiles conventional RCC tissue patient-matched normal kidney cortex. Sequencing 32 protein spots significantly increased expression RCC samples (>/= 4/6 patients) 41 proteins whose levels decreased (6/6 patients) confirmed several previously known RCC-associated changes increases Mn-superoxide dismutase, lactate dehydrogenase-A, aldolase C, pyruvate kinase M2, thymidine phosphorylase. Additionally, several previously unknown changes identified, including increased expression three members annexin family increased levels actin depolymerisation factor cofilin. Warburg effect also demonstrated identification increases proteins involved majority steps glycolytic pathway decreases gluconeogenic reactions, together parallel decrease several mitochondrial enzymes. number alterations seen confirmed additional samples immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, laser capture microdissection.
