 method isolation high yield intact chloroplasts unicellular green alga Dunaliella marina (Volvocales) described. procedure uses chemically induced lysis cells polycationic macromolecules, DEAE-dextran (M=500,000) poly-D,L-lysine (M=30,000-70,000). Reaction conditions optimized respect obtaining high yield intact chloroplasts, isopycnic centrifugation linear sucrose density gradient, varying concentration polycation temperature pH incubation. Broken chloroplasts devoid stromal marker enzymes fructosebisphosphate phosphatase ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase, containing mitochondrial (fumarase) microbody (catalase) contamination, banded bouyant density 1.18 g cm(-3). Intact chloroplasts, indicated retention alkaline fructosebisphosphate phosphatase ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase, found 30% yield (chlorophyll intact cells, 100%) equilibrium density 1.24 g cm(-3). Contamination cytoplasmic material (pyruvate kinase), mitochondria, microbodies less 8% each.
