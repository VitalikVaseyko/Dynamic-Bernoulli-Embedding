 1. ratio [ATP]/[ADP][P(i)], measured direct determination three components rat liver, found various nutritional states approximately value ratio [ATP]/[ADP][P(i)] calculated concentrations lactate, pyruvate, glyceraldehyde phosphate 3-phosphoglycerate assumption lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase 3-phosphoglycerate kinase near-equilibrium liver. implies redox state NAD couple cytoplasm linked to, partially controlled by, phosphorylation state adenine nucleotides. 2. combined equilibrium constant glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3-phosphoglycerate kinase reactions 38 degrees C I0.25, found 5.9x10(-6). 3. fall [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio starvation situations taken consequence primary fall [ATP]/[ADP][HPO(4) (2-)] ratio.
