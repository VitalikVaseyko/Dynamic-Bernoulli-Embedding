 Pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase (P5'N) acquired deficiency found several hematologic disorders including beta-thalassemia. previous studies suggested aldehydes produced membrane lipid peroxidation could play role P5'N inactivation thalassemia. evaluate effects thalassemic "environment" transfused red blood cells, tested P5'N, pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PD) activity, creatine content, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) red cells homozygous transfusion-dependent thalassemic children, immediately following one month transfusion. red cells aged thalassemic plasma, P5'N activity, creatine level, GSH stability stimulated HMS flux significantly decreased. results fit presence thalassemic plasma molecules interfering antioxidant red cell defenses. Normal red cells incubated thalassemic plasma display significant stimulation basal HMS (p less 0.01). Transfused red cell metabolic alterations could explained plasma pro-oxidant activity may contribute reducing red cell survival host plasma.
