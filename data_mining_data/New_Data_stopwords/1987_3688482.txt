 Round spermatids (steps 1-8) isolated rat testes kinetic properties pyruvate (PK) extract examined. plot PK activity phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP concentration appeared sigmoidal. Km values PEP ADP 0.12 0.29 mM, respectively. However, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) stimulated enzyme markedly increasing affinity PEP. FBP (0.35 microM) required 50% activation PK, PK activity measured 25 microM PEP 0.2 mM ADP. contrast, ATP (Ki = 6.5 mM) inhibited PK activity. hand, presence 5 mM glucose, level FBP spermatids increased markedly, ATP declined rapidly. level ADP remained constant. activity PK spermatid extract measured intracellular levels FBP, ADP ATP, maximum. results suggest PK becomes probably fully activated glucose metabolized glycolytic pathway spermatids. seems unlikely PK rate-limiting step glycolysis spermatids.
