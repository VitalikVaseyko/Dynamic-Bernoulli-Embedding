 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection shown regulate microRNA 130a (miR-130a) patient biopsy specimens cultured cells. sought identify miR-130a target genes explore mechanisms miR-130a regulates HCV hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. used bioinformatics software, including miRanda, TargetScan, PITA, RNAhybrid, predict potential miR-130a target genes. miR-130a target genes overexpressed knocked use small interfering RNA (siRNA) clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA). Selected gene mRNAs proteins, together HCV replication OR6 cells, HCV JFH1-infected Huh7.5.1 cells, HCV JFH1-infected primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) HBV replication HepAD38 cells, HBV-infected NTCP-Huh7.5.1 cells, HBV-infected PHHs, measured quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) Western blotting, respectively. selected 116 predicted target genes whose expression related viral pathogenesis immunity qPCR validation. these, gene encoding pyruvate kinase liver red blood cell (PKLR) confirmed regulated miR-130a overexpression. miR-130a overexpression (via mimic) knocked PKLR mRNA protein levels. miR-130a inhibitor gRNA increased PKLR expression, HCV replication, HBV replication, miR-130a gRNA PKLR overexpression increased HCV HBV replication. Supplemental pyruvate increased HCV HBV replication rescued inhibition HCV HBV replication miR-130a mimic PKLR knockdown. concluded miR-130a regulates HCV HBV replication targeting PKLR subsequent pyruvate production. data provide novel insights key metabolic enzymatic pathway steps regulated miR-130a, including steps involving PKLR pyruvate, subverted HCV HBV replication.IMPORTANCE identified miR-130a regulates target gene PKLR subsequent effect pyruvate production. Pyruvate key intermediate several metabolic pathways, identified pyruvate plays key role regulation HCV HBV replication. previously unrecognized, miRNA-regulated antiviral mechanism implications development host-directed strategies interrupt viral life cycle prevent establishment persistent infection HCV, HBV, potentially viral infections.
