 Mitochondrial dysfunction implicated cause energy deprivation heart failure (HF). Herein, tested individual combined effects two pathogenic factors nonischemic HF, inhibition nitric oxide synthesis [with l-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME)] hypertension [with angiotensin II (AngII)], myocardial mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, metabolic gene expression. l-NAME AngII administered individually combination mice 5 wk. Although treatments increased blood pressure reduced cardiac contractile function, l-NAME + AngII group associated severe HF, characterized edema, hypertrophy, oxidative stress, increased expression Nppa Nppb, decreased expression Atp2a2 Camk2b. l-NAME + AngII-treated mice exhibited robust deterioration cardiac mitochondrial function, observed reduced respiratory control ratios subsarcolemmal mitochondria reduced state 3 levels interfibrillar mitochondria complex complex II substrates. Cardiac myofibrils showed reduced ADP-supported oligomycin-inhibited oxygen consumption. Mitochondrial functional impairment accompanied reduced mitochondrial DNA content activities pyruvate dehydrogenase complex increased H2O2 production tissue protein carbonyls hearts AngII l-NAME + AngII groups. Microarray analyses revealed majority gene changes attributed l-NAME + AngII group. Pathway analyses indicated significant changes metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial function, cardiac hypertrophy, fatty acid metabolism l-NAME + AngII hearts. conclude l-NAME + AngII associated impaired mitochondrial respiratory function increased oxidative stress compared either l-NAME AngII alone, resulting nonischemic HF.
