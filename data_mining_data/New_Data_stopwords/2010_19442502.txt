 term 'innate resistance' covers mechanisms resistance operate early course infections, preceding adaptive immune responses exert effects several days. first example genetically controlled innate resistance human malaria demonstration 1954 sickle-cell heterozygotes less severe Plasmodium falciparum infections children normal adult hemoglobin. observation repeatedly confirmed, recently independent studies genome-wide associations severe falciparum malaria, identified HBB locus major signal association. abnormal hemoglobins, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency pyruvate kinase deficiency also confer degree resistance falciparum malaria. second early example inherited innate resistance malaria finding nonexpression Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor (DARC) erythrocytes confers resistance P. vivax. However, parasite enter nonhuman primate red cells independently DARC, human populations P. vivax observed persons lacking DARC. Hence DARC receptor P. vivax, likely major one human transmission. Innate resistance malaria rapidly reinforced adaptive immune responses, cell-mediated humoral. Among factors influencing efficacy adaptive immune responses malaria MHC complex constitution hosts. differs among populations, presumably variations structure parasite antigens recognized immune systems hosts.
