 Several hepatocyte mitogens identified, signals triggering G0/G1 transition cell cycle progression hepatocytes remain unknown. Using hepatocyte primary cultures, investigated role epidermal growth factor/pyruvate entry progression G1 phase analyzed expression cell cycle markers. show G0/G1 transition occurs hepatocyte isolation evidenced expression early genes c-fos, c-jun, c-myc. culture, hepatocytes progress G1 regardless growth factor stimulation restriction point (R point) mid-late G1 beyond cannot complete cell cycle without mitogenic stimulation. Changes cell cycle gene expression associated progression G1; cyclin E mRNA level low early G1 increases G1/S boundary, protein constantly detected cell cycle undergoes change electrophoretic mobility mid-late G1 R point. addition, drastic induction cyclin D1 mRNA protein, lesser extent cyclin D2 mRNA, takes place mitogen-stimulated cells R point. contrast, cyclin D3 mRNA appears early G1, remains constant stimulated cells, accumulates unstimulated arrested cells, paralleling cyclin-dependent kinase 4 mRNA expression. results characterize different steps G1 phase hepatocytes.
