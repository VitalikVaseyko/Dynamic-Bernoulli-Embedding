 1. initial rapid phase ATP hydrolysis bovine heart submitochondrial particles soluble F1-ATPase insensitive anion activation (sulphite) inhibition (azide). 2. second slow phase ATP hydrolysis hyperbolically inhibited azide (Ki approximately 10(-5) M); inosine triphosphatase activity submitochondrial particles F1-ATPase insensitive azide sulphite. 3. rate interconversion rapid azide-insensitive slow azide-sensitive phases ATP hydrolysis depend azide concentration, strongly depends ATP concentration. 4. Sulphite prevents interconversion rapid initial phase reaction slower second phase, also prevents slowly reverses inhibition azide. 5. presence sulphite mixture ADP reacts ATPase submitochondrial particles changes pattern following activation process. 6. Azide blocks activation ATP-inhibited ATPase submitochondrial particles phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. 7. results obtained suggest inhibiting effect azide mitochondrial ATPase due stabilization inactive E*.ADP complex formed ATP hydrolysis; activation ATPase sulphite also realized equilibrium intermediate active E.ADP complex inactive E*.ADP complex.
