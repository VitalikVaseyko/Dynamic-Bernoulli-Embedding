 Intracellular mechanisms regulating fat oxidation investigated human skeletal muscle exercise. Eight young, healthy, moderately trained men performed bicycle exercise (60 min, 65% peak O2 consumption) two occasions, ingested either 1) high-carbohydrate diet (H-CHO) 2) low-carbohydrate diet (L-CHO) exercise alter muscle glycogen content well induce, respectively, low high rates fat oxidation. Leg fat oxidation 122% higher exercise L-CHO H-CHO (P < 0.001). keeping this, activity alpha2-AMP-activated protein kinase (alpha2-AMPK) increased twice much L-CHO H-CHO (P < 0.01) 60 min exercise. However, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)beta Ser221 phosphorylation increased extent (6-fold) two conditions. concentration malonyl-CoA reduced 13% exercise conditions (P < 0.05). Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity higher exercise H-CHO L-CHO (P < 0.01). H-CHO only, concentrations acetyl-CoA acetylcarnitine increased (P < 0.001), concentration free carnitine decreased (P < 0.01), exercise. data suggest decrease concentration malonyl-CoA, secondary alpha2-AMPK activation ACC inhibition (by phosphorylation), contributes increase fat oxidation observed onset exercise regardless muscle glycogen levels. also suggest that, high muscle glycogen, availability free carnitine may limit fat oxidation exercise, due increased use acetylcarnitine formation.
