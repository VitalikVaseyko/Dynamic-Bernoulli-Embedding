 wood frog (Rana sylvatica) survive winter frozen state, frog's tissues also exposed dehydration, ischemia, anoxia. Critical wood frog survival conditions global metabolic rate depression, accumulation glucose cryoprotectant, reliance anaerobic glycolysis energy production. Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes final reaction aerobic glycolysis, generating pyruvate ATP phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP. study investigated effect stress condition experienced R. sylvatica freezing, including dehydration anoxia, PK regulation. PK muscle frozen dehydrated frogs exhibited lower affinity PEP (Km = 0.098 +/- 0.003 Km = 0.092 +/- 0.008) PK control anoxic conditions (Km = 0.065 +/- 0.003 Km = 0.073 +/- 0.002). Immunoblotting showed greater serine phosphorylation muscle PK frozen dehydrated frogs relative control anoxic states, suggesting reversible phosphorylation regulatory mechanism PK activity freezing stress. Furthermore, PK frozen animals exhibited greater stability thermal urea-induced denaturing conditions PK control animals. Phosphorylation PK freezing may contribute mediating energy conservation maintaining intracellular cryoprotectant levels, well increase enzyme stability stress.
