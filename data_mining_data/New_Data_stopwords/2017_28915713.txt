 Although survival outcomes cancer patients improved dramatically via conventional chemotherapy targeted therapy last decades, still tough clinical challenges badly needs overcome, anticancer drug resistance, inevitable recurrences, cancer progression metastasis. Simultaneously, accumulated evidence demonstrates aberrant glucose metabolism termed 'the Warburg effect' cancer cell closely associated malignant phenotypes. 2009, novel 'two-compartment metabolic coupling' model, also named 'the reverse Warburg effect', proposed attracted lots attention. Based new model, consider whether new viewpoint exploited improving existent anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. review focuses paradigm shift 'the Warburg effect' 'the reverse Warburg effect', features molecular mechanisms 'the reverse Warburg effect', discuss significance fundamental researches clinical practice.
