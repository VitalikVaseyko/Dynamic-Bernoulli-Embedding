 Energy metabolism early life stages shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis subjected temperature reduction (26 20 degrees C) determined using activities citrate synthase (CS) pyruvate kinase (PK). temperatures, weight-specific activity CS decreased throughout ontogenetic development protozoea II (PZ II) postlarva XII-XIV (PL XII-XIV). PK activity reached pronounced peak PL V-VI, followed decrease PL XII-XIV. Temperature reduction produced variation oxygen consumption rates (QO(2)), ammonia-N excretion enzyme activities. Ammonia-N excretion higher 20 degrees C mysis III (M III), PL V-VI PL XII-XIV, resulting substantially lower O:N ratios stages. QO(2) increased protozoea II (PZ II) mysis (M I) 26 degrees C, difference QO(2) detected subsequent stages either temperature. fact coincided higher CS PK activities III, PL V-VI PL XII-XIV 20 degrees C compared 26 degrees C. Regressions individual enzyme activities dry weight exhibited slope values 0.85-0.92 CS 1.1-1.2 PK temperature reduction reflected higher slope values 20 26 degrees C enzymes. Weight-specific CS activity positively correlated QO(2) 20 26 degrees C, may thus used indicator aerobic metabolic rate throughout early stages F. paulensis. variation enzyme activities discussed relation possible metabolic adaptations specific ontogenetic events F. paulensis life cycle. Here, catalytic efficiency energy-metabolism enzymes reflected ontogenetic shifts behaviour larval settlement adoption benthic existence early postlarvae. cases, enhanced enzyme activities appeared counteract negative effects reduced temperature.
