 levels pyruvate kinase (PYK1), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) phosphoglycerate mutase (GPM1) mRNAs measured batch growth yeast-to-hyphal transition Candida albicans. four mRNAs behaved similar fashion. PYK1, ADH1, PGK1 GPM1 mRNA levels shown increase dramatically exponential growth phase yeast form, decrease relatively low levels stationary phase. dimorphic transition induced using two sets conditions: (i) increase temperature (from 25 degrees C 37 degrees C) combined addition serum medium; (ii) increase temperature (from 25 degrees C 37 degrees C) increase pH growth medium (from pH 4.5 pH 6.5). Additional cultures analysed control addition serum, changes temperature pH. Immediately following dilution late-exponential cells fresh media levels four glycolytic mRNAs decreased rapidly contrast ACT1 mRNA control, level increased conditions. recovery glycolytic mRNA levels depended culture conditions, direct correlation formation germ tubes, addition serum medium, increase culture temperature, medium pH, glucose concentration. indicates changes glycolytic gene expression accompany dimorphic transition C. albicans reflect underlying physiological status cells morphogenesis alterations cell shape.
