 essay, propose embryos express metabolic phenotype necessarily different differentiated somatic cells like rapidly proliferating cancer cells. metabolic adaptation, known Warburg effect, supports rapid cell proliferation. One hallmarks Warburg effect pyruvate directed away tri-carboxylic acid cycle metabolized lactate, resulting buildup glycolytic intermediates. Although comparatively inefficient way generate ATP, adaptation allows cell meet critical metabolic requirements, including biomass production redox regulation. Thus, utilization gives proliferating cells selective growth advantage. model represents completely new understanding embryo metabolism context broad, interconnected network metabolic mechanisms influence viability, versus current dogma carbohydrate metabolism via oxidative phosphorylation. complete understanding embryo metabolism critical better support embryo viability vitro, avoid forcing embryos adapt suboptimal culture conditions significant cost future growth development.
