 present study measured activity cytosolic enzymes involved intracellular glucose metabolism mononuclear leukocytes 77 obese subjects 39 nondiabetic 38 newly-diagnosed untreated type II diabetes mellitus. 28 subjects (19 nondiabetic 18 diabetic) also study insulin binding monocytes. 35 subjects (14 nondiabetic, 21 diabetic) underwent insulin tolerance test evaluation vivo insulin action. Mononuclear leukocytes diabetic obese patients showed significantly lower activities hexokinase (HK), 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) activities similar two groups. whole population HK G6PDH activities inversely correlated fasting 2-h OGTT plasma glucose levels. Neither plasma insulin levels maximal specific insulin binding monocytes significantly correlated enzyme activities measured. Conversely, parameter insulin action generated insulin tolerance test significantly correlated HK, G6PDH 6PGDH. results indicate obese subjects presence diabetes associated reduced activity enzymes glucose metabolism mononuclear leukocytes. multiple enzymatic defect correlated impairment vivo insulin action.
