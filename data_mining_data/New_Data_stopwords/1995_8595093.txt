 Three antischistosomal drugs, praziquantel (CAS 55268-74-1, EMBAY 8440, Prz), oxamniquine (CAS 21738-42-1, Oxa) oltipraz (CAS 64224-21-1, Olt) examined ability reverse disturbances carbohydrate metabolism induced Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection. infected mice screened every 2 weeks 16 weeks body liver weights addition assessment activities liver pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) (glycolysis), citrate synthase (CS) (Krebs' cycle) glycogen phosphorylase (GP) (glycogenolysis), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) (hexose monophosphate shunt). Results study showed infection S. mansoni caused following changes mice livers: 1. significant increase liver weights 6th week infection, coincided schistosomal egg deposition, whereas body weights reduced, 2. remarkable increase activities PK PFK 4th week infection, 3. marked reduction CS, GP, G6PDH 6PGDH. results lead conclusion glycolysis largely stimulated livers infected mice expense metabolic pathways glucose utilization. Administration Prz infected mice caused normalization measured enzyme activities almost 2nd week infection, whereas liver body weights improved 10th week. Oxa less effective regards Olt least. data support selection Prz drug choice S. mansoni infection.
