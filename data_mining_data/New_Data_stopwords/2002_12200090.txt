 effects heavy metals growth, intermediary metabolism enzyme activities investigated yellow perch (Perca flavescens), sampled summer fall lakes situated along contamination gradient Cd, Zn Cu mining region Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. exposure-dependent decrease condition factor observed seasons. Liver glycogen triglyceride reserves higher summer fall fish reference lake, seasonal pattern different fish contaminated lakes. Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) levels also influenced season contamination. Activities malic enzyme (ME) glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) liver higher summer fall reference lakes whereas seasonal variations detected fish contaminated lakes. Activities pyruvate kinase (PyK), aspartate transaminase (AST), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) malate dehydrogenase (MDH), higher fish contaminated lakes fall summer. Chronic exposure yellow perch sublethal levels heavy metals impairs growth alters seasonal cycling liver glycogen triglycerides well activities metabolic enzymes.
