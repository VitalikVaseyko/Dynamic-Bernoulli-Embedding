 BACKGROUND: Warburg effect found wide spectrum human cancers, however underlying mechanisms still unclear. study aims explore role cellular oxidative stress relation glycolysis Warburg effect hepatoma cells. METHODS: Various cell lines combining environmental hypoxia used vitro model mimic tumor microenvironment vivo. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) xanthine oxidase (XO) gene transfection used produce various cellular redox levels. 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCF) fluorescence ESR spectrum used detect cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: found endogenous exogenous interference cellular oxidative stress sensitively regulate glycolysis Warburg effect hepatoma cells. Hepatoma cells displayed high level free radicals compared immortalized normal hepatocyte cells. Increasing level ROS stress hepatoma cells directly upregulate HIF-1 activate glycolysis without requirement hypoxic condition. explains mechanism whereby aerobic glycolysis, i.e. Warburg effect arises. Either endogenously upregulating SOD exogenously administration antioxidant can, downregulating ROS level, effectively regulate energy pathways hepatoma cells inhibit growth tumor cells xenograft tumors. CONCLUSION: study suggests Warburg effect related inherently high level cellular ROS HIF-1. Hepatoma cells adaptation hypoxia survival rapid growth exploits oxidative stress ectopically activated glycolysis compensate energy supply. specific mechanism tumor cells cellular oxidative stress activate glycolysis meet energy metabolism requirement could exploited selectively kill tumor cells.
