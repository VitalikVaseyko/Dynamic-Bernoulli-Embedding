 inflammasome protein complex comprises intracellular sensor (typically Nod-like receptor), precursor procaspase-1 adaptor ASC. Inflammasome activation leads maturation caspase-1 processing substrates, interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) IL-18. Although initially inflammasome described complex affects infection inflammation, subsequent evidence suggested inflammasome activation influences many metabolic disorders, including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, gout obesity. Another feature inflammation general inflammasome specifically activation process profound effect aerobic glycolysis (the 'Warburg effect'). explore Warburg effect might linked inflammation inflammasome activation.
