 Cancer cells use glucose glutamine major sources energy precursor intermediates, enhanced glycolysis glutamimolysis major hallmarks metabolic reprogramming cancer. Oncogene activation tumor suppressor gene inactivation alter multiple intracellular signaling pathways affect glycolysis glutaminolysis. N-Myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) tumor suppressor gene inhibiting cancer growth, metastasis invasion. However, role molecular mechanism NDRG2 cancer metabolism remains unclear. study, discovered role tumor suppressor gene NDRG2 aerobic glycolysis glutaminolysis cancer cells. NDRG2 inhibited glucose consumption lactate production, glutamine consumption glutamate production colorectal cancer cells. Analysis glucose transporters catalytic enzymes involved glycolysis revealed glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) significantly suppressed NDRG2. Analysis glutamine transporter catalytic enzymes involved glutaminolysis revealed glutamine transporter ASC amino-acid transporter 2 (ASCT2) glutaminase 1 (GLS1) also significantly suppressed NDRG2. Transcription factor c-Myc mediated inhibition glycolysis glutaminolysis NDRG2. importantly, NDRG2 inhibited expression c-Myc suppressing expression beta-catenin, transcriptionally activate C-MYC gene nucleus. addition, growth proliferation colorectal cancer cells suppressed significantly NDRG2 inhibition glycolysis glutaminolysis. Taken together, findings indicate NDRG2 functions essential regulator glycolysis glutaminolysis via repression c-Myc, acts suppressor carcinogenesis coordinately targeting glucose glutamine transporter, multiple catalytic enzymes involved glycolysis glutaminolysis, fuels bioenergy biomaterials needed cancer proliferation progress.
