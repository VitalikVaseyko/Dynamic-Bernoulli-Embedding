 present evidence multisite NT closure humans representative examples types NTDs would expected NT closure humans similar experimental mice models. determine majority NTDs classified multisite closure model. evidence multisite closure NT apparent previous epidemiological studies, recognized monogenic disorders, environmental teratogenic exposures. Previous reliance single-site closure model resulted grouping anomalies, obscuring evidence multisite NT closure, etiological heterogeneity, varying recurrence risks, site-specific effects environmental factors. NTDs previously referred multifactorial, due multiple genes environmental factors. Etiological heterogeneity demonstrated previously well. Classification NTDs closure site beneficial better defining etiologies environmental susceptibilities. Similarly, apparent us genetic variations closure sequence, rate, location likely monogenic result affected embryos susceptible specific environmental factors, effect folic acid deficiency. Individual closure sites likely control specific embryonically expressed genes, whose monogenic nature may apparent postnatally. disorders Meckel-Gruber syndrome Walker-Warburg syndrome, monogenic etiology NTDs affected individuals apparent associated malformations. three important implications study: first monogenic mouse models helpful investigating pathogenesis NTDs humans. homologies mouse human genome may allow linkage studies done families recurrence NTDs. Second, order useful results studies NTDs, NT anomalies need accurately described, either classical nomenclature (eg, meroacranium) referring corresponding closure site involvement (eg, closure 2 defect). Special attention needs addressed NTDs appear fit discrete closure site (eg, midthoracic spina bifida cystica) laterally displaced NTDs, since may due etiologies. improved nutrition, particularly folic acid treatment, specific etiologies remaining NTDs may become apparent. Finally, recurrence risks NTDs may vary families based closure site affected, whether associated anomalies present.
