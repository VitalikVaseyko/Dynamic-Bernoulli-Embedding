 Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) highly lethal malignancy often late diagnosis consequent poor prognosis. Chemotherapy therapeutic strategy patients. Compared normal cells, tumor cells preferentially metabolize glucose lactate, even aerobic conditions. metabolic alterations support growth invasion tumor cells, also promote chemoresistance. purpose study explore role metformin regulating metabolism CCA, well investigate whether metformin could act chemosensitizer HDAC3 inhibitor BG45, therefore potential treatment CCA. bioinformatic analysis, found aberrant metabolism contributed proliferation CCA cells. Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer analysis lactate production analysis showed metformin could act suppressor Warburg effect CCA cells. Western blotting showed metformin decreased expression LDHA, plays key role Warburg effect. However, suppression Warburg effect sufficient induce CCA cellular apoptosis. According previous research, showed HDAC3 inhibitor (MI192) involved CCA apoptosis, observed metformin combined BG45 (a novel specific HDAC3 inhibitor) effectively induced apoptosis CCA cells vitro. Furthermore, vivo experiments revealed combined treatment metformin BG45 markedly reduced CCA growth CCA xenograft model. data revealed reversing Warburg effect metformin sensitizes cells antitumor effects HDAC3 inhibitors. provides rationale using combination metformin BG45 new therapeutic strategy treatment CCA.
