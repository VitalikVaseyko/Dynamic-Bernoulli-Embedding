 Sheep treated large amounts copper (20 mg CuSO4,5H2O/kg body wt. per day) 9 weeks examine effect copper excess iron metabolism. addition confirming massive haemolysis accumulation copper occurs liver, kidney plasma 7 weeks exposure excess copper, observed excess copper produced increased plasma iron concentration transferrin saturation within 1 week. Further, iron preferentially accumulated spleen 4 6 weeks copper treatment, producing 3-fold increases iron content ferritin non-ferritin fractions. 3-4 fold increase also observed amount ferritin could isolated spleen. copper treatment little effect concentration iron liver bone marrow. following properties erythrocytes also unaffected copper treatment: size, haemoglobin content pyruvate kinase activity, although erythrocyte concentration copper increased 6 weeks. Copper accumulated spleen 6 9 weeks, probably owing phagocytosis erythrocytes containing high concentrations copper. data suggest copper excess influences iron metabolism, initially causing compensated haemolytic anaemia, later interfering re-utilization iron ferritin reticuloendothelial cells spleen.
