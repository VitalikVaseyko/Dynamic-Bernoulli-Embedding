 ex vivo approach hepatic gene therapy involves several steps, include isolation culture hepatocytes, followed transduction retrovirus. Subsequently, autologous hepatocytes transplanted. number hepatocytes transduced retroviruses bearing therapeutic gene one limiting steps impair success strategy. presently describe experimental approach leads improved transduction efficiency mouse human hepatocytes vitro. using recombinant retrovirus bearing Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene, show addition growth factors cells, namely human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), allows marked increase transduction efficiency mouse (up 80%) human (40%) hepatocytes. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) due mutation low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene results deficiency LDL receptors. Transduction human LDL receptor cDNA transcriptional control L-type pyruvate kinase promoter-activator mouse hepatocytes led elevated tissue-specific expression human protein. results suggest ex vivo approach remains promising alternative hepatic gene therapy.
