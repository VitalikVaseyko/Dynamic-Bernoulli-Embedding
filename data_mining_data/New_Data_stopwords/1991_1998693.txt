 Differential extraction creatine kinase activity (CK, EC 2.7.3.2) rat brain mitochondria graded concentrations digitonin yielded supernates varying CK activity. analyzed isozyme electrophoresis gel permeation chromatography extracts contained different species creatine kinase: (i) one third total CK activity consisting contaminating cytosolic brain-type CK (B-CK) liberated 100 micrograms digitonin/mg mitochondrial protein, (ii) approx. 20% CK activity consisting B-CK, above, plus dimeric octameric mitochondrial CK (Mi-CK), extracted 300 micrograms/mg digitonin, whereas (iii) CK activity, consisting B-CK mainly octameric Mi-CK, liberated 700 micrograms/mg digitonin. contrast Mi-CK, B-CK associated contaminating synaptic vesicles readily extracted even low concentrations digitonin, hand octameric Mi-CK significantly resistant digitonin extraction dimeric enzyme species. appeared Mi-CK resistant treatment 300 micrograms/mg digitonin consisted large percentage octamers organized complex two envelope membranes, activity latent still remained regulated outer membrane pore, is: (i) Mi-CK activity mitoplasts could inhibited reversibly cessation adenine nucleotide transport outer membrane pore polyanion, (ii) ADP produced Mi-CK mitoplasts available external pyruvate kinase, (iii) approx. 50% total CK activity susceptible inhibition iodo acetate phosphocreatine. agreement findings preferential association octameric Mi-CK also found isolated contact site fractions indicating physiological role Mi-CK energy transfer structure-function relationship Mi-CK octamers sites. addition evidence interaction Mi-CK adenylate translocator presented.
