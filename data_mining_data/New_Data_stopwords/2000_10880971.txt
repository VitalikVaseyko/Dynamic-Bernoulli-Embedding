 Cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) Brassica napus suspension cells purified 201-fold electrophoretic homogeneity final specific activity 51 micromol phosphoenolpyruvate utilized per min per mg protein. SDS/PAGE gel filtration analyses final preparation indicated PKc 220-kDa homotetramer composed 56-kDa subunits. enzyme relatively heat-stable displayed broad pH optimum pH 6.8. PKc activity absolutely dependent upon simultaneous presence bivalent univalent cation, Mg2+ K+ fulfilling requirement. Hyperbolic saturation kinetics observed phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, Mg2+ K+ (apparent Km values = 0.12, 0.075, 0.21 0.48 mM, respectively). Although enzyme utilized UDP, CDP IDP alternative nucleotides, ADP preferred substrate. L-Glutamate, oxalate, flavonoids rutin quercetin effective inhibitors (I50 values = 4, 0.3, 0.07, 0.10 mM, respectively). L-Aspartate functioned activator (Ka = 0.31 mM) causing 40% increase Vmax completely reversing inhibition PKc L-glutamate. Reciprocal control L-aspartate L-glutamate specific amino acids provides rationale vivo activation PKc occurs periods enhanced NH +4-assimilation. Allosteric features B. napus PKc compared B. napus phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. model presented highlights pivotal role L-aspartate L-glutamate coordinate regulation key phosphoenolpyruvate utilizing cytosolic enzymes.
