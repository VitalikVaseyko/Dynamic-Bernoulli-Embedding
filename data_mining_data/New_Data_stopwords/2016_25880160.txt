 previously reported Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) extracted Chinese medicine Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge, attenuates hypertrophy neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) induced isoproterenol (Iso). present study designed investigate effects possible mechanism APS Iso-induced hypertrophy rats NRVMs focus tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) signaling mediated energy biosynthesis. 36-Week old rats randomly divided 3 groups: (1) Control, rats received vehicle; (2) Iso, rats received isoproterenol injections; (3) Iso+APS, rats received isoproterenol injections APS. NRVMs divided similar groups rats. results showed combination APS Iso significantly attenuated pathological changes, reduced ratios heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) left ventricular weight/BW (LVW/BW), improved cardiac hemodynamics, down-regulated mRNA protein expression atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), increased ratios ATP/ADP ATP/AMP, decreased content free fatty acid (FFA) heart tissue rats compared Iso alone. addition, pretreatment APS significantly decreased surface area protein content, down-regulated mRNA protein expression ANP, increased ratios ATP/ADP ATP/AMP, decreased content FFA NRVMs compared Iso alone. Furthermore, APS increased protein expressions ATP5D, sigma subunit ATP synthase, PGC-1alpha pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) tissue NRVMs respectively inhibited production TNF-alpha serum culture medium compared Iso alone. results suggested APS attenuates Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy regulating TNF-alpha/PGC-1alpha signaling mediated energy biosynthesis.
