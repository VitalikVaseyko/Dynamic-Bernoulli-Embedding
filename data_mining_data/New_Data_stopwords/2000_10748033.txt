 three distal transcriptional regulatory elements rat pyruvate kinase gene, referred boxes A, B, C, located around -270 base pairs upstream transcriptional initiation site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays specific competitors antibodies show box box B bind Sp1 Sp3 box C binds nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y). Luciferase reporter assays revealed although box box B alone independent effect luciferase activities, box C alone stimulates transcription. However, inclusion three elements lead maximal activity synergistic effect, mainly box B box C, suggesting functional synergism Sp1/Sp3 NF-Y critical pyruvate kinase (PKM) gene distal promoter activity. fact, co-transfection dominant negative mutant NF-YA (NF-YA29) resulted decrease reporter activity box C-dependent manner. addition, overexpression Sp1 Sp3 NF-Y Drosophila SL2 cells synergistically stimulated PKM gene distal promoter activity. Using mammalian two-hybrid system HeLa cells, shown Sp1 Sp3 interacted NF-YA NF-YB NF-YC. Moreover, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed vitro translated (35)S-labeled NF-YA interacted Sp1 Sp3 vitro. subunit interaction domain NF-YA, forms heterotrimer NF-YB NF-YC, required interactions Sp1 Sp3. Thus, conclude Sp1, Sp3, NF-Y stimulate transcription PKM gene via interactions.
