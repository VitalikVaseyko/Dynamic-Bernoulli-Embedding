 BACKGROUND: Signal transducer activator transcription (STAT)3 involved metabolic shift cancer cells, Warburg effect pro-oncogenic activity. develop efficient STAT3 inhibitors cancer cells, novel proteomic metabolic target molecules need explored using multi-omics approaches context STAT3 gene inhibition-mediated tumor growth suppression. MATERIALS METHODS: found short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated STAT3 inhibition suppressed tumor growth highly STAT3-activated lymphoma cell line, SCC-3 cells, investigated effect STAT3 inhibition metabolic switching using 2-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis capillary electrophoresis-time flight-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: identified latexin proteomic marker candidate metabolic enzymes including fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDOA) metabolic marker candidate STAT3-targeting therapy using STAT3-specific shRNA gene transduction. particular, latexin expression up-regulated four STAT3-activated cancer cell lines including SCC-3 transduced STAT3-specific shRNA. up-regulation latexin identified SCC-3 tumors transplanted nude mice treatment STAT3 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: results suggest STAT3 inactivation reverses glycolytic shift down-regulating key enzymes induces up-regulation latexin tumor-suppressor molecule, partially results cancer cell apoptosis tumor growth suppression.
