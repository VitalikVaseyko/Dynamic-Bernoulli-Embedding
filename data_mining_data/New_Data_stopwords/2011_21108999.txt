 One important sites peroxynitrite action affects cellular function known nitration tyrosine residues. However, tryptophan residues could another target peroxynitrite-dependent modification protein function, shown previously using model protein (F. Yamakura et al., J. Biochem. 138:57-69; 2005). Here, report identification several proteins allowed us determine position nitrotryptophan amino acid sequences complex system. modified lysates PC12 cells without nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment peroxynitrite (0.98 4.9 mM). Western blot analyses using anti-6-nitrotryptophan antibody showed several immunoreactive bands spots, subsequently subjected trypsin digestion LC-ESI-MS-MS analysis. identified several tryptic peptides including nitrotryptophan residues, derived L-lactate dehydrogenase A, malate dehydrogenase 1, M2 pyruvate kinase, heat-shock protein 90 alpha, peroxynitrite-treated lysates PC12 cells, l-lactate dehydrogenase A, malate dehydrogenase 1, transaldorase, lactoylglutathione lyase, peroxynitrite-treated lysates NGF/PC12 cells. molar ratio 3-nitrotyrosine 6-nitrotryptophan protease-digested PC12 cell lysates treated peroxynitrite determined 5.8 1 using HPLC-CoulArray system. first report identify several specific sites nitrated tryptophan proteins complex system treated peroxynitrite compare susceptibility nitration tryptophan tyrosine residues proteins.
