 BACKGROUND: Pathogenesis pulmonary hypertension complex involves activation transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) shifts cellular metabolism aerobic respiration glycolysis, part, increasing expression downstream target pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), thereby promoting proliferative, apoptosis-resistant phenotype pulmonary vascular cells. Activation nuclear hormone transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), attenuates pulmonary hypertension pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation. current study, determined whether PPARgamma inhibits HIF-1alpha PDK-1 expression human PASMCs. METHODS: HPASMCs exposed normoxia (21% O2) hypoxia (1% O2) 2-72 hours +/- treatment PPARgamma-ligand, rosiglitazone (RSG, 10muM). RESULTS: Compared normoxia, HIF-1alpha mRNA levels elevated HPASMC 2 hours hypoxia reduced baseline levels 24-72 hours. HIF-1alpha protein levels increased following 4 8 hours hypoxia returned baseline levels 24 72 hours. PDK-1 protein levels increased following 24 hours hypoxia remained elevated 72 hours. RSG treatment onset hypoxia attenuated HIF-1alpha protein PDK-1 mRNA protein levels 4, 8 24 hours hypoxia, respectively. However, RSG treatment final 24 hours 72-hour hypoxia, intervention inhibits HPASMC proliferation, failed prevent hypoxia-induced PDK-1 expression. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia causes transient activation HPASMC HIF-1alpha attenuated RSG treatment initiated hypoxia onset. findings provide novel evidence PPARgamma modulates fundamental acute cellular responses hypoxia HIF-1-dependent HIF-1-independent mechanisms.
