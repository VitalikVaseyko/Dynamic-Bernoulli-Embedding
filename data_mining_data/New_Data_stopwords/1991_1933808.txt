 cellular expression K-type pyruvate kinase studied immunohistochemically several normal neoplastic tissues human origin. authors used monoclonal antibody, designated ES1, raised human K-type pyruvate kinase. contrast normal counterparts, strong immunoreactivity found rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1), carcinoma pancreas (n = 1), neurofibromas (n = 2). Furthermore, staining leiomyosarcomas (n = 2) shown intense compared normal smooth muscle cells leiomyomas (n = 2). findings show knowledge cellular expression K-type pyruvate kinase identifies cell types expression serves oncodevelopmental marker. addition, immunohistochemical studies give information whether shifts toward K-type containing isozymes pyruvate kinase, determined electrophoresis whole cytosolic extracts various tumors, due altered gene expression due proliferation cells normally express already K-type pyruvate kinase. first possibility probably occurs rhabdomyosarcomas. latter possibility seems valid astrocytomas astrocytes express K-type pyruvate kinase normal brain.
