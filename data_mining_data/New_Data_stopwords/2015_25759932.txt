 Cancer cell metabolism often characterized shift oxidative glycolytic bioenergetics pathway, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Whether deregulation microRNAs contributes Warburg effect remains largely unknown. Here, show miR-495 expression decreased thus induces metabolic shift glioma cells. miR-495 performs function increasing expression Glut1, leading increase glucose uptake lactate production. altered metabolism induced miR-495 results rapid growth cancer cells. results identify miR-495 molecular switch involved orchestration Warburg effect glioma cells via targeting expression Glut1.
