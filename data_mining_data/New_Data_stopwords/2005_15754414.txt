 Nonspherocytic hereditary anemias occasionally accompanied significant iron overload significance development chronic liver disease clear. described two cases patients chronic liver disease severe iron overload due chronic hereditary hemolysis. patients signs liver cirrhosis severe hemolysis since childhood. hereditary pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) discovered underlying reason hemolysis. Sequencing pyruvate kinase gene showed mutation within exon 11. Liver histology patients revealed cirrhosis severe iron overload primary hemochromatosis excluded HFE-gene analysis. iron reduction therapy desferrioxamine led significant decrease serum ferritin sustained clinical improvement. PKD-induced hemolysis may cause severe iron overload even absence HFE-genotype abnormalities. secondary iron overload lead chronic liver disease cirrhosis. Therefore, iron metabolism PKD patients closely monitored iron overload consequently treated.
