 BACKGROUND: Dystroglycanopathies group congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) autosomal recessive inheritance, often associated CNS ocular involvement. characterized abnormal glycosylation alpha-dystroglycan, caused mutations least six genes encoding enzymes: FKTN, POMGNT1, POMT1, POMT2, FKRP, LARGE. POMT2 mutations recently identified Walker-Warburg syndrome milder muscle-eye-brain disease-like form. METHODS: studied mentally retarded patients CMD, analyzed POMT2 sequencing coding regions, also performed haplotype analysis patients family members carrying new POMT2 mutation. RESULTS: report three novel POMT2 mutations. One these, p.Tyr666Cys, homozygous two unrelated patients compound heterozygous state others. patients showed severe diffuse muscle weakness, microcephaly, severe mental retardation, marked lordoscoliosis hyperextended head. Elevated CK levels, cerebral cortical atrophy, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia constant findings. Mild cardiac abnormalities, focal white matter abnormalities, partial corpus callosum hypoplasia detected single cases. Eye involvement absent mild. genotype analysis, defined distinct 170kb haplotype encompassing POMT2 shared subjects harboring mutation p.Tyr666Cys. CONCLUSIONS: results broaden clinical spectrum associated POMT2 mutations, considered patients CMD associated microcephaly, severe mental retardation without ocular involvement.
