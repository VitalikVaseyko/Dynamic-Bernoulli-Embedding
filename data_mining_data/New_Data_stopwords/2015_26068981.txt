 nucleophosmin (NPM1) activates cancer development progression many malignant tumors. However, regulatory role underlying mechanisms NPM1 pancreatic cancer unknown. study, showed NPM1 up-regulated PDAC, indicated poor prognosis. also identified NPM1 could stimulate aerobic glycolysis repress fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) pancreatic cancer cells. Restoring FBP1 expression partially reversed tumor-promoting effects NPM1, loss FBP1 PDAC tissues indicative poorer prognosis. sum, NPM1 promotes aerobic glycolysis tumor progression patients pancreatic cancer inhibiting FBP1.
