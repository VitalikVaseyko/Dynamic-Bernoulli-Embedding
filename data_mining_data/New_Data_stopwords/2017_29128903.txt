 Wernicke's encephalopathy, common neurological disease, caused thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Neuropathy resulting thiamine deficiency hallmark Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome chronic alcohol users. underlying mechanisms deficiency progression neuropathy remain understood. uncover unknown mechanisms thiamine deficiency alcohol abuse, used chronic alcohol consumption thiamine deficiency diet ingestion animal models. Observations animal models validated primary human neuronal culture neurodegenerative process. employed radio-labeled bio-distribution thiamine, qualitative quantitative analyses various biomarkers neurodegenerative process. present studies, established disruption thiamine transport across intestinal gut blood-brain barrier axis cause thiamine deficiency brain neurodegeneration. found reduction thiamine transport across interfaces cause reduction synthesis thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), active cofactor pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha (PDHE1alpha). findings revealed decrease levels PDHE1alpha cofactors switched activation PD kinase (PDK) brain, thereby triggering neuronal phosphorylation PDHE1alpha (p-PDHE1alpha). Dysfunctional phosphorylated PDHE1alpha causes reduction mitochondrial aerobic respiration led neurodegeneration. concluded impairment thiamine transport across gut-BBB-axis led insufficient TPP synthesis critical Wernicke-neuropathy, could effectively prevented stabilizing thiamine transporters.
