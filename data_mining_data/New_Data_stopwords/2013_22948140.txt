 previously demonstrated nerve cell lines selected resistance amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide exhibit elevated aerobic glycolysis part due increased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA). Here, show overexpression either PDK1 LDHA rat CNS cell line (B12) confers resistance Abeta neurotoxins. Treatment Abeta-sensitive cells various toxins resulted mitochondrial hyperpolarization, immediately followed rapid depolarization cell death, events accompanied increased production cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). contrast, cells expressing either PDK1 LDHA maintained lower mitochondrial membrane potential decreased ROS production without exposure toxins. Additionally, PDK1- LDHA-overexpressing cells exhibited decreased oxygen consumption maintained levels ATP normal culture conditions following Abeta treatment. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis wild type mouse primary cortical neurons treated Abeta cortical tissue extracts 12-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice showed decreased expression LDHA PDK1 compared controls. Additionally, post-mortem brain extracts patients Alzheimer disease exhibited decrease PDK1 expression compared nondemented patients. Collectively, findings indicate key Warburg effect enzymes play central role mediating neuronal resistance Alphabeta neurotoxins decreasing mitochondrial activity subsequent ROS production. Maintenance PDK1 LDHA expression certain regions brain may explain individuals tolerate high levels Abeta deposition without developing Alzheimer disease.
