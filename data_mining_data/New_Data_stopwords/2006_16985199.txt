 Honeybees, Apis mellifera, gradually increase rate forage uptake gain foraging experience. increase foraging performance proposed occur result learning; however, factors affecting flight ability changes physiological components flight metabolism could also contribute pattern. Thus, purpose study assess contribution physiological changes increase honeybee foraging performance. investigated aspects honeybee flight muscle biochemistry throughout adult life, non-foraging hive bees, young mature foragers, old foragers near end lifespan. Two-dimensional gel proteomic analysis honeybee thorax muscle revealed increase several proteins hive bees mature foragers including troponin 10a, aldolase superoxide dismutase. contrast, activities (V(max)) enzymes involved aerobic performance, phosphofructokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase cytochrome c oxidase, increase flight muscles hive bees, young foragers, mature foragers old foragers. However, citrate synthase activity found increase foraging experience. Hence, results suggest plasticity structural metabolic components flight muscles foraging experience.
