 Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterized neuronal cell death two kinds deposits, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) senile plaques. main component NFT paired helical filaments (PHF), mainly consist hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Tau protein kinases II found candidate enzymes responsible hyperphosphorylation tau induce formation PHF. Since prior phosphorylation tau TPKII strongly enhanced action TPKI, thought TPKII involved formation PHF-tau concert TPKI. cloning, TPKI found identical glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta), TPKII consists novel 23 kDa protein activator catalytic subunit identical cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). phosphorylation sites tau TPKI TPKII could account most, all, major phosphorylation sites fetal tau PHF-tau. antibody site specifically phosphorylated TPKI (Ser413) could identify three neurofibrillary lesions AD brain, double staining either TPKI TPKII NFT brain Down's syndrome patients clearly demonstrated TPKI TPKII associated NFT vivo, suggesting level TPKI TPKII elevated AD brain mechanism. hand, levels TPKs change developmentally, high neonatal period phosphorylation fetal tau proceeds actively, suggesting TPKI/TPKII cooperative system important physiological role formation neural networks. AD brain, aberrant accumulation amyloid-beta protein (A beta) occurs ahead accumulation PHF NFT. primary culture embryonic rat hippocampus treated 20 microM beta, induction TPKI, extensive phosphorylation tau programmed cell death observed, indicating TPKI induced beta phosphorylates tau, followed disruption axonal transportation finally cell death. using yeast two hybrid system, TPKI found interact pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), key enzyme glycolytic pathway. PDH phosphorylated vitro TPKI reduce activity converting pyruvate acetyl-CoA, required acetylcholine synthesis. primary culture rat hippocampal cells treated beta, PDH inactivated inverse relation activation TPKI, resulting accumulation pyruvate lactate, energy failure induced disturbance glucose metabolism, shortage acetylcholine owing deficiency acetyl-CoA, characteristic AD brain. cholinergic neurons septum, non-aggregated beta, specifically beta (1-42), beta (1-40), caused shortage acetylcholine activation TPKI inactivation PDH without cell death.
