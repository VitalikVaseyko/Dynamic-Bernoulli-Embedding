 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) interacts phosphoglycerate kinase (ATP:3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.3) fluorescence enhanced blue shift occurs. evidence ANS binds site nucleotide substrate. work described herein shows various anion inhibitors added ANS-enzyme solution, de-enhancement fluorescence occurs. Extrapolation infinite anion concentration shows pyruvate ions effective quenchers (ca. 90%) nitrate ions least effective, sulfate phosphate ions intermediate. results consistent earlier enzymes kinetic findings suggesting pyruvate ions ANS, competing nucleotide substrate, able bind enzyme simultaneously sulfate, phosphate nitrate ions can, various extents, affect properties active centre phosphoglycerate kinase via conformational changes without sharing ligands nucleotide substrate.
