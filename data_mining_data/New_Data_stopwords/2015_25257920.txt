 Astrocytes releasing glucose- and/or glycogen-derived lactate glutamine play crucial role shaping neuronal function plasticity. Little known, however, metabolic functions astrocytes, e.g., ability degrade glucosyl units, affected presence neurons. address issue carried experiments demonstrated co-culturing rat hippocampal astrocytes neurons significantly elevates level mRNA protein crucial enzymes glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase), glycogen metabolism (glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase), glutamine synthetase astrocytes. Simultaneously, decrease capability neurons metabolize glucose glutamine observed. provide evidence neurons alter expression astrocytic enzymes secretion yet unknown molecule(s) extracellular fluid. Moreover, data demonstrate almost studied enzymes may localize astrocytic nuclei localization affected co-culturing neurons also reduces proliferative activity astrocytes. results provide first experimental evidence astrocyte-neuron crosstalk substantially affects expression basal metabolic enzymes types cells influences subcellular localization astrocytes.
