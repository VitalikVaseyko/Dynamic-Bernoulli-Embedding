 BACKGROUND: Systems biology calls studying system-level properties genes proteins rather individual chemical/biological properties, regarding bio-molecules system components. characterizing critical components system classifying accordingly, study underlying complex mechanisms, facilitating researches drug target selection, metabolic engineering, complex disease, etc. date, studies aiming goal confined topology-based flux-analysis approaches. However, proteins tertiary structures specific functions, especially metabolic systems. Thus topological properties connectivity, path length, etc., good surrogates protein properties. Also, manner individual sensitivity analysis flux-analysis approaches cannot reveal simultaneous impacts collateral components well overall impact system, thus lacking system-level perspective. RESULTS: present work, developed method directly assess protein system-level properties based system dynamics silico knockouts, regarding conceptual term "criticality". Applying method E. coli central carbon metabolic system, found multiple enzymes including phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, transketolase-b, etc., critical roles system terms system states dynamical stability. contrast, another set enzymes including glucose-6-phosphate isomerise, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglucomutase, etc., exerted little influences deleted. finding consistent experimental characterization metabolic essentiality studies E. coli gene essentiality functions. also found enzymes could affect distant metabolites enzymes even greater close neighbour asymmetry system-level properties enzymes catalyzing alternative pathways could give rise local flux compensation. CONCLUSIONS: method creates different angle evaluating protein criticality biological system conventional methodologies. Moreover, method leads consistent results experimental references, showing efficiency studying protein system-level properties. Besides working metabolic systems, application method extended kinds bio-systems reveal constitutive/functional properties system building blocks.
