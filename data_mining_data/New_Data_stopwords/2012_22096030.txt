 Glycolysis catabolic process glucose hydrolysis needed energy biosynthetic intermediates, whereas gluconeogenesis glucose production process important maintaining blood glucose levels starvation. Although share many enzymes, two processes simply reverse instead reciprocally regulated. Two key enzymes regulate irreversible steps two processes pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK), catalyze last first step glycolysis gluconeogenesis, respectively, regulated lysine acetylation. Acetylation Lys305 PKM (muscle form PK) decreases activity also targets chaperone-mediated autophagy subsequent lysosome degradation. Acetylation PEPCK, hand, targets ubiquitylation HECT E3 ligase, UBR5/EDD1, subsequent proteasomal degradation. studies established model acetylation regulates metabolic enzymes via different mechanisms also revealed cross talk acetylation ubiquitination. Given metabolic enzymes acetylated, propose acetylation major posttranslational modifier regulates cellular metabolism.
