 Hemodynamic forces regulate vascular functions. Disturbed flow (DF) occurs arterial bifurcations curvatures, activates endothelial cells (ECs), results vascular inflammation ultimately atherosclerosis. However, DF alters EC metabolism, whether resulting metabolic changes induce EC activation, unknown. Using transcriptomics bioenergetic analysis, discovered DF induces glycolysis reduces mitochondrial respiratory capacity human aortic ECs. DF-induced metabolic reprogramming required hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), downstream NAD(P)H oxidase-4 (NOX4)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). HIF-1alpha increased glycolytic enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), reduces mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Swine aortic arch endothelia exhibited elevated ROS, NOX4, HIF-1alpha, glycolytic enzyme PDK1 expression, suggesting DF leads metabolic reprogramming vivo. Inhibition glycolysis reduced inflammation suggesting causal relationship flow-induced metabolic changes EC activation. findings highlight previously uncharacterized role flow-induced metabolic reprogramming inflammation ECs.
