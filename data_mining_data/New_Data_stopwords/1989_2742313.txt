 Serum muscle enzyme activity assays routinely performed 36 patients glycogen storage diseases (15 types 1a 1b, 12 type III, 9 types VI IX). Creatine phosphokinase serum activity increased type III. Glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, aldolase lactate dehydrogenase serum activities increased forms glycogen storage disease studied. Muscle involvement may least partly explain increased serum enzyme activities type III.
