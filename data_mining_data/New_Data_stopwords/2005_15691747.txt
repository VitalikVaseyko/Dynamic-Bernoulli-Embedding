 effect culture age intra- extracellular metabolite levels well vitro determined specific activities enzymes central carbon metabolism investigated evolution 90 generations Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-7D aerobic glucose/ethanol-limited chemostat specific dilution rate 0.052 h(-1). found fluxes consumed (O2, glucose/ethanol) secreted compounds (CO2) change significantly entire cultivation period. However, morphological changes observed, leading increased cellular surface area. 90 generations chemostat growth residual glucose concentration decreased, also intracellular concentrations trehalose, glycolytic intermediates, TCA cycle intermediates amino acids found decreased factor 5-10. exception glyoxylate showed fivefold increase concentration. addition specific activities glycolytic enzymes also decreased factor 5-10 long-term cultivation. Exceptions hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities remained unchanged. Furthermore, concentrations adenylate nucleotides well energy charge cells change significant manner. Surprisingly, specific activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), malate synthase (MS) isocitrate lyase (ICL) increased significantly 90 generations chemostat cultivation. changes seem indicate pattern metabolic overcapacities (for reversible reactions) storage pools (trehalose, high levels amino acids excess protein enzymes) lost evolution period. driving force proposed growth advantage absence metabolic overcapacities.
