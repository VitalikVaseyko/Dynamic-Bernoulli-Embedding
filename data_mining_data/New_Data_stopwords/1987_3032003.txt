 Carp (Cyprinus carpio) liver maintained normal glycogen content enzyme complement several days organ culture. Epinephrine-stimulated glycogenolysis, phosphorylase activation, cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation concentration-dependent manner EC50s 100, 100, 500 nM, respectively. actions blocked beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. Glycogenolysis tissue cAMP uninfluenced 10(-6) arginine vasotocin, arginine vasopressin, lysine vasotocin, lysine vasopressin, mesotocin, oxytocin, slightly increased 10(-5) isotocin slightly decreased 10(-6) angiotensin II. [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICP), beta-adrenergic ligand, bound isolated carp liver membranes KD 83 pM. Maximum binding 45 fmol/mg protein 600 pM. Propranolol, isoprenaline, epinephrine, phenylephrine, norepinephrine, phenoxybenzamine displaced ICP KDs 100 nM, 2, 20, 20, 60, 200 microM, respectively. alpha-adrenergic antagonists, yohimbine prazosin, showed specific binding. data provide evidence catecholamines act via beta-adrenergic receptors carp liver alpha-adrenergic receptors present. Vasoactive peptides play significant role regulation carp liver glycogenolysis.
