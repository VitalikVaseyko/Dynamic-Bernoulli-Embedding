 important differences short- long-term effects adrenaline determinants glucose tolerance. assess metabolic adaptation tissue level, present study examined effect acute prolonged vivo elevation adrenaline glycogen metabolism glycolysis skeletal muscle. Adrenaline (50 ng.kg-1.min-1) infused 2 h 74 h results compared 1 h 0.9% NaCl infusion six trained dogs. Muscle glycogen content reduced long-term adrenaline (161 +/- 17 vs NaCl 250 +/- 24 mumol/g dry weight; p less 0.05) short-term adrenaline (233 +/- 21) indicating sustained effect adrenaline glycogen metabolism. Acutely, glycogen synthase reduced (short-term adrenaline 12 +/- 6 vs NaCl 22 +/- 7 mumol glycosyl units.g-1.min-1; p less 0.05) returned normal prolonged adrenaline infusion (20 +/- 5). contrast, Km glycogen phosphorylase alpha changed acutely (short-term adrenaline 31 +/- 6 vs NaCl 27 +/- 7 mmol/l inorganic phosphate) reduced long-term infusion (19 +/- 4; p less 0.05 vs short-term adrenaline). Thus, short- long-term adrenaline infusion, different enzyme changes, although likely promote glycogenolysis cases. glycolytic pathway substrates glucose 6-phosphate fructose 6-phosphate change significantly hexokinase inhibited. Acutely, phosphofructokinase reduced Vmax (short-term adrenaline 34 +/- 6 vs NaCl 44 +/- 5 U/g; p less 0.05) still maximal operating rate vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
