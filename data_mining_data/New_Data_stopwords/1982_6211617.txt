 Leishmania mexicana mexicana amastigotes shown contain greater activities promastigotes enzymes catalyse beta-oxidation fatty acids, lower activities several glycolytic enzymes, activity pyruvate kinase especially low. results suggest beta-oxidation fatty acids relatively important Leishmania amastigotes promastigotes, whereas reverse true glycolysis. Succinic dehydrogenase peptidase activities much higher promastigotes amastigotes. activities glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, acid phosphatase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase varied less, although case activity significantly lower mammalian stage. method lysing fractionating L. m. mexicana promastigotes developed. Using procedure established many glycolytic functionally related enzymes located cell organelles, hexokinase intimately connected particulate part parasite, microsomal fraction L. m. mexicana different composition microsomes mammalian liver cells.
