 phosphotransfer network system, enzymes creatine kinase (CK), adenylate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK), contributes efficient intracellular energetic communication cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption production tissues high energetic demand, cerebral tissue. Thus, aim study evaluate whether aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) intoxication diet negatively affects cerebral phosphotransfer network related impairment cerebral ATP levels silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). Brain cytosolic CK activity decreased animals fed diet contaminated AFB1 days 14 21 post-feeding, mitochondrial CK activity increased, compared control group (basal diet). Also, cerebral AK PK activity decreased animals fed diet contaminated AFB1 days 14 21 post-feeding, similarly results observed cerebral ATP levels. Based evidence, inhibition cerebral cytosolic CK activity compensated stimulation mitochondrial CK activity attempt prevent impairment communication sites ATP generation ATP utilization. inhibition cerebral AK PK activity leads impairment cerebral energy homeostasis, decreasing brain's ATP availability. Moreover, absence reciprocal compensatory mechanism enzymes contributes cerebral energetic imbalance, may contribute disease pathophysiology.
