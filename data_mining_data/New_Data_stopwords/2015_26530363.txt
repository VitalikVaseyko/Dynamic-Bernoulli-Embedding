 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) among many biochemical parameters represents valuable enzyme patients cancer possibility easy routine measurement many clinical laboratories. Previous studies mostly based investigated LDH serum patients cancer aims estimate clinical significance. new directions investigation LDH based principle tumor cells release intracellular enzymes trough damaged cell membrane, mostly consequence intracellular mitochondrial machinery alteration, apoptosis deregulation. consideration used in-vitro assays, also respect clinical characteristics tumor patients. Based new techniques molecular biology shown intracellular characteristics LDH enzyme sensitive indicators cellular metabolic state, aerobic anaerobic direction glycolysis, activation status malignant transformation. Using different molecular analyses useful analyzed intracellular LDH activity different cell line tumor tissues obtained patients, understanding complexity cancer biochemistry also early clinical diagnosis. Based understandings LDH altered metabolism, new therapy option created aims blocking certain metabolic pathways stop tumors growth.
