 study undertaken examine effects thyroid hormonal deficiency (1) standard (SMR) maximal (VO2max) rates O2 consumption, (2) tissue glycolytic oxidative capacities (3) submaximal locomotory endurance lizard (Dipsosaurus dorsalis). Surgical thyroidectomy induced hypothyroidism animals determined levels plasma thyroxine. Hypothyroid lizards lower levels SMR (-48%), VO2max (-16%) citrate synthase activity liver, heart skeletal muscle compared controls. correlated decrease locomotory endurance thyroid-deficient animals. Pyruvate kinase activity (an index glycolytic capacity) tissues, myofibrillar ATPase activity (an index contractile velocity) white iliofibularis muscle, showed significant changes thyroid-deficient animals. Thyroid hormones appear important ultimately establishing animal's capacity locomotory endurance. findings suggest new selective context understanding evolution thyroid function.
