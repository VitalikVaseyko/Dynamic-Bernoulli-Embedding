 isotope effect describes mass-dependent variations natural isotope abundances particular element. pilot study, measured (65)Cu/(63)Cu ratios serums 20 breast 8 colorectal cancer patients, correspond to, respectively, 90 49 samples taken different times molecular biomarker documentation. Copper isotope compositions determined multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). compared literature data control group 50 healthy blood donors, abundances Cu isotopes predict mortality colorectal cancer group probability p = 0.018. breast cancer patients group control women probability goes p = 0.0006 AUC ROC curve 0.75. patients considered preliminary study serum delta(65)Cu lower threshold value -0.35 per thousand (per mil) survive. marker, drop delta(65)Cu precedes molecular biomarkers several months. observed decrease delta(65)Cu serum cancer patients assigned extensive oxidative chelation copper cytosolic lactate. potential Cu isotope variability new diagnostic tool breast colorectal cancer seems strong. Shifts Cu isotope compositions fingerprint cytosolic Cu chelation lactate mono- bidentates. simple scheme provides straightforward explanation isotopically light Cu serum isotopically heavy Cu cancer cells: Cu(+) escaping chelation lactate excreted blood stream isotopically light. Low delta(65)Cu values serum therefore reveal strength lactate production Warburg effect.
