 time-consuming procedure isolation pyruvate kinase isoenzymes rabbit kidney cortex (more 5 hrs) 0-2 degrees led obtaining desensitized form "L" type, resembling "M3" type enzyme sceletal muscle. Rapid isolation pyruvate kinase "L" type (within 2.5 hrs) 4-6 degrees provided isoenzyme active (allosteric) form.
