 Cytoplasmic beta-actin five glycolytic enzyme cDNAs isolated rat skeletal muscle cDNA library together genomic clone rat cytochrome c used probes quantitate respective RNA transcription rates isolated nuclei run transcription assays stationary cells cultured normal 2% oxygen. transcription rates lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase aldolase increased 2-5 fold 72 hr exposure 2% oxygen. small increase actin RNA transcription cytochrome c glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA transcription rates decreased. Since previous studies demonstrated increase steady state glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA low O2 exposure concluded level RNA regulated post transcriptionally whereas four glycolytic enzyme RNAs regulated least partially level transcription oxygen availability. relative transcriptional rates RNAs study related cellular RNA protein concentrations.
