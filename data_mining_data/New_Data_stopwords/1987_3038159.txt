 Red cell pyruvate kinase (PK), pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase (P5N) reduced glutathione content (GSH) studied 126 untreated patients acute leukaemia (AL, 80 cases), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL, 38 cases) B-cell lymphoma leukaemic expression (LSCL, eight cases). Acute leukaemias classified lymphoblastic (ALL) non-lymphoblastic (ANLL), latter sub-divided four different variants according FAB morphological criteria (1976). significant decrease PK activity observed ANLL group, leading clear-cut difference group normal value obtained. decrease P5N activity similar morphological variants ANLL abnormalities low PEP assay system fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru 1,6-P2) activation observed. P5N activity found significantly decreased groups patients except B-CLL, normal. regards different morphological groups ANLL, striking decrease P5N activity observed M3 variant. Although red cell GSH content significantly increased groups patients, correlation demonstrated raised GSH levels decreased P5N activities.
