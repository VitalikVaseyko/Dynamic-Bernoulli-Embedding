 Renal cysts clinically genetically heterogeneous conditions. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) frequent life-threatening genetic disease mainly caused mutations PKD1. presence six PKD1 pseudogenes tremendous allelic heterogeneity make molecular genetic testing challenging requiring laborious locus-specific amplification. Increasing evidence suggests major role PKD1 early severe cases ADPKD patients recessive form. Furthermore becoming obvious clinical manifestations mimicked mutations number genes necessity broader genetic testing. established validated sequence capture based NGS testing approach genes known cystic polycystic kidney disease including PKD1. Thereby, demonstrate applied standard mapping algorithm specifically aligns reads PKD1 locus overcomes complication unspecific capture pseudogenes. Employing careful experienced assessment NGS data, method shown specific equally sensitive established methods. additional advantage conventional Sanger sequencing detection copy number variations (CNVs). Sophisticated bioinformatic read simulation increased high analytical depth validation study demonstrated strength approach. raise awareness limitations pitfalls common NGS workflows applied complex regions like PKD1 demonstrating quality NGS needs high coverage target region. this, propose time- cost-efficient diagnostic strategy comprehensive molecular genetic testing polycystic kidney disease highly automatable particular value therapeutic options PKD emerge genetic testing needed larger numbers patients.
