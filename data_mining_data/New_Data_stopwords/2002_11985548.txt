 1. Metabolic processes acutely chronically regulated response changes workload heart. Acute changes cardiac work result activation inactivation existing enzymes altered fluxes existing metabolic pathways. Sustained chronic changes cardiac work result trophic transcriptional alterations. 2. metabolic consequences sustained increase decrease workload heart surprisingly uniform consist switch predominant oxidation fatty acids oxidation glucose. 3. switch reflected changes transcript levels three key regulators mitochondrial function: pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), phosphorylates inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD), regulates malonyl-CoA levels and, therefore, rates beta-oxidation long-chain fatty acids, uncoupling protein 3 (UCP-3), uncouples oxidative phosphorylation ADP. 4. transcript levels three proteins downregulated hypertrophy well atrophy rat heart. three transcripts transcriptionally regulated nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). 5. Diminished expression PPARalpha PPARalpha-regulated genes constitutes adaptive mechanism response altered workload, reactivation PPARalpha hypertrophied heart results severe contractile dysfunction.
