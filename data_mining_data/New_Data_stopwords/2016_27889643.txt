 study alterations tumor metabolism allow identification new targets innovative anticancer strategies. Metabolic alterations generally established vitro, conclusions often extrapolated vivo situation without tumor metabolic phenotyping. highlight key role microenvironment tumor metabolism, studied response glycolytic oxidative tumor models metabolic modulations vitro vivo. MDA-MB-231 SiHa tumor models, characterized vitro glycolytic oxidative, respectively, studied. Theoretically, passing hypoxic state oxygenated state, Warburg phenotype conserve glycolytic metabolism, whereas oxidative phenotype switch glycolytic oxidative metabolism (Pasteur effect). challenge applied vitro vivo evaluate impact different oxic conditions glucose metabolism. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, lactate production, tumor oxygenation, metabolic fluxes monitored vivo using positron emission tomography, microdialysis, electron paramagnetic resonance imaging, (13)C-hyperpolarizated magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. vitro, MDA-MB-231 cells glycolytic hypoxic oxygenated conditions, whereas SiHa cells underwent metabolic shift reoxygenation. contrary, vivo, increase tumor oxygenation (induced carbogen challenge) led similar metabolic shift glucose metabolism tumor models. major discordance metabolic patterns observed vitro vivo highlights extrapolation vitro metabolic profiling vivo situation taken cautiously metabolic phenotyping using molecular imaging mandatory vivo.
