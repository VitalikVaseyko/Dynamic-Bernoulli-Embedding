 current standard care glioblastoma (GBM) surgical resection, radiotherapy, treatment temozolomide (TMZ). However, resistance current therapies recurrence common. improve survival, agents target PI3K signaling pathway, activated approximately 88% GBM, currently clinical trials. challenge therapies tumor shrinkage always observed. New imaging methods therefore needed monitor response therapy predict survival. goal study determine whether hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) used monitor response second-generation dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor voxtalisib (XL765, SAR245409), alone combination TMZ. investigated GS-2 U87-MG GBM orthotopic tumors mice, used MRI, hyperpolarized (13)C MRSI, (1)H MRS monitor effects treatment. study, (1)H MRS could predict tumor response therapy. However, models, observed significantly lower hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio animals treated voxtalisib, TMZ, combination therapy, compared controls. metabolic alteration observed prior MRI-detectable changes tumor size, consistent drug action, associated enhanced animal survival. findings confirm potential translational value hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio biomarker noninvasively assessing effects emerging therapies patients GBM.
