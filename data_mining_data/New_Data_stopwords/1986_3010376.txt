 liver "glucostat" organism serves time "ammonia-sink pH stat". key enzymes involved glucose uptake release urea glutamine formation reciprocally distributed liver parenchyma: glucogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructosebisphosphatase (FBPase) glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) well ureagenic enzyme carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CAPS) predominant periportal zone. glycolytic enzymes glucokinase (GK) pyruvate kinase type L (PKL) well glutaminogenic enzyme glutamine synthetase (GluNS) prevalent perivenous zone. heterogeneity appears prerequisite normal "glucostat, ammonia-sink pH-stat" function liver. birth liver gluconeogenic organ, weaning becomes "glycolytic/gluconeogenic" glucostat. rat zonation PEPCK, G6Pase CAPS developed gradually birth completed weaning, i.e. would functionally required. 2/3 partial hepatectomy liver looses normal glucostat function becomes gluconeogenic organ. change zonation PEPCK PKL also lost; restored second week operation. starvation liver also looses glucostat function become major glucose supplier organism. Zonation PEPCK PKL diminished extent major function perivenous zone altered glucose uptake release. diabetes liver loose glucostat function; however, function severely impaired. Zonation PEPCK increased PKL decreased manner major function perivenous zone, glucose uptake, entirely changed diminished. concluded various physiological states studied zonation enzymes correlated well glucostat function liver.
