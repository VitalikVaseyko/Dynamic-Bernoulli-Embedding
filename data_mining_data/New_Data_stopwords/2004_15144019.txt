 Bone marrow progenitors migrate thymus, proliferate differentiate immunologically competent cells. report show mice transgenic SV40 antigens control L-pyruvate kinase promoter develop, first step, thymic hyperplasia thymocytes epithelial cells. Morphological studies (histology, immunohistolabeling electron microscopy) revealed modifications thymic microenvironment gradual expansion medullary epithelial cells 1 month-old mice, taking cortical region. Then, thymic carcinoma develops. Two-color labeling frozen sections identified transgene medullary epithelial cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated marked increase mature CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes adult mice (39 +/- 10 x 10(6) transgenic mice 12 +/- 5 x 10(6) age-matched controls). Furthermore, thymocyte export disturbed.
