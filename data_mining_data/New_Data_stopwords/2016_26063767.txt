 radiotherapy significantly increases median survival patients glioblastoma, modulation radiation resistance significant interest. High glycolytic states tumor cells known correlate strongly radioresistance; thus, concept metabolic targeting needs investigated combination radiotherapy. Metabolically, elevated glycolysis glioblastoma cells observed postradiotherapy together upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha target pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). Dichloroacetate, PDK inhibitor currently used treat lactic acidosis, modify tumor metabolism activating mitochondrial activity force glycolytic tumor cells oxidative phosphorylation. Dichloroacetate alone demonstrated modest antitumor effects vitro vivo models glioblastoma ability reverse radiotherapy-induced glycolytic shift given combination. vitro, enhanced inhibition clonogenicity panel glioblastoma cells observed dichloroacetate combined radiotherapy. mechanistic investigation revealed dichloroacetate sensitized glioblastoma cells radiotherapy inducing cell-cycle arrest G2-M phase, reducing mitochondrial reserve capacity, increasing oxidative stress well DNA damage glioblastoma cells together radiotherapy. vivo, combinatorial treatment dichloroacetate radiotherapy improved survival orthotopic glioblastoma-bearing mice. conclusion, study provides proof concept dichloroacetate effectively sensitize glioblastoma cells radiotherapy modulating metabolic state tumor cells. findings warrant evaluation combination dichloroacetate radiotherapy clinical trials.
