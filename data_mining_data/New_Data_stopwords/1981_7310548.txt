 Histidine found activator rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase activity K1/2 value 0.6 mM. Carnosine anserine also effective, much higher concentrations. Hyperbolic kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate enzyme found either presence absence histidine. number divalent cations tested, Zn2+ found effective inhibitor enzyme activity low concentrations. kinetic data suggested Zn2+ acted inhibitor well activator enzyme activity; high affinity binding site associated Ki approximately 4.8 microM Zn2+ catalytic site associated Km approximately 80 microM Zn2+ Zn2+, associated high affinity binding site enzyme, removed addition histidine K1/2 approximately 0.6 mM. findings, histidine including anserine carnosine muscle may act chelating agent enzyme activity.
