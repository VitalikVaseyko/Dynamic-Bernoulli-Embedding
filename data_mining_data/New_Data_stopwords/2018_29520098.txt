 Many cancers adeptly modulate metabolism thrive fluctuating oxygen conditions; however, current tools fail image metabolic vascular endpoints spatial resolutions needed visualize adaptations vivo. demonstrate high-resolution intravital microscopy technique quantify glucose uptake, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), SO2 characterize vivo phentoypes three distinct murine breast cancer lines. Tetramethyl rhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) thoroughly validated report MMP normal tumor-bearing mice. Imaging MMP glucose uptake together vascular endpoints revealed metastatic 4T1 tumors maintained increased glucose uptake across SO2 ("Warburg effect"), also showed increased MMP relative normal tissue. Non-metastatic 67NR 4T07 tumor lines displayed increased MMP, comparable glucose uptake, relative normal tissue. 4T1 peritumoral areas also showed significant glycolytic shift relative tumor regions. hypoxic stress test, 4T1 tumors showed significant increases MMP corresponding significant drops SO2, indicative intensified mitochondrial metabolism. Conversely, 4T07 67NR tumors shifted toward glycolysis hypoxia. findings underscore importance imaging metabolic endpoints within context living microenvironment gain insight tumor's adaptive behavior.
