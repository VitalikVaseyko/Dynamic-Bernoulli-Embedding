 Counter-current distribution non charge-sensitive aqueous poly(ethylene glycol)-dextran two phase systems allows fractionation rat bone marrow cells two broad cell subpopulations different distribution coefficients relatively short time. Morphological identification enzymatic studies suggest erythroid cells mainly present subpopulation higher distribution coefficient. distribution coefficient and, therefore, surface hydrophobicity cells, apparently increase parallel increase degree differentiation maturation.
