 O-linked beta-N-actylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) carbohydrate post-translational modification hydroxyl groups serine and/or threonine residues cytosolic nuclear proteins. Analogous phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation plays crucial regulatory roles variety cellular processes. O-GlcNAc termed nutritional sensor, global levels modification elevated response increased glucose glutamine flux hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. unique feature cancer cell energy metabolism shift oxidative phosphorylation less efficient glycolytic pathway (Warburg effect), necessitating greatly increased glucose uptake. Additionally, help meet increased biosynthetic demands, cancer cells also up-regulate glutamine uptake. led us hypothesize universal feature increased glucose glutamine uptake cancer cells might linked increased O-GlcNAc levels. Indeed, recent work many different cancer types indicates hyper-O-GlcNAcylation general feature cancer contributes transformed phenotypes. review, describe known/potential links hyper-O-GlcNAcylation specific hallmarks cancer, including cancer cell proliferation, survival, cell stresses, invasion metastasis, aneuploidy, energy metabolism. also discuss inhibition hyper-O-GlcNAcylation potential novel therapeutic target cancer treatment.
