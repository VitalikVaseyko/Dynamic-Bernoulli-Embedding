 Two-component systems crucial signal perception modulation bacterial behavior. Nevertheless, date, ligands identified directly interact histidine kinases. histidine kinase/response regulator system YehU/YehT Escherichia coli part nutrient-sensing network. demonstrate system senses onset nutrient limitation amino acid rich media responds extracellular pyruvate. Binding radiolabeled pyruvate found full-length YehU right-side-out membrane vesicles well truncated, membrane-integrated variant, confirming YehU high-affinity receptor extracellular pyruvate. Therefore propose rename YehU/YehT BtsS/BtsR, "Brenztraubensaure", name given pyruvic acid first synthesized. function BtsS/BtsR also assessed clinically relevant uropathogenic E. coli strain. Quantitative transcriptional analysis revealed BtsS/BtsR importance acute chronic urinary-tract infections.
