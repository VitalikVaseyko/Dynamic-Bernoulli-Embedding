 Reverting glycolytic metabolism attractive strategy cancer therapy upregulated glycolysis hallmark various cancers. Dichloroacetate (DCA), long used treat lactic acidosis various pathologies, emerged promising anti-cancer drug. inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, DCA reactivates mitochondrial function decreases glycolytic flux tumor cells resulting cell cycle arrest apoptosis. recently documented DCA able induce metabolic switch preferentially glycolytic cancer cells, leading oxidative phenotype decreasing proliferation, oxidative cells remained less sensitive DCA treatment. evaluate relevance observation vivo, aim present study characterize effect DCA glycolytic MDA-MB-231 tumors oxidative SiHa tumors using advanced pharmacodynamic metabolic biomarkers. Oxygen consumption, studied 17O magnetic resonance spectroscopy, glucose uptake, evaluated 18F-FDG PET pyruvate transformation lactate, measured using hyperpolarized 13C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, monitored 24 hours DCA treatment tumor bearing mice. tumor models, clear metabolic shift observed. Surprisingly, imaging parameters concur conclusion glycolytic tumors oxidative tumors presented similar response DCA. results highlight major discordance metabolic cancer cell bioenergetics vitro vivo setups, indicating critical role local microenvironment tumor metabolic behaviors.
