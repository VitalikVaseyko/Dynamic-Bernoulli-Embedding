 potential role dystrophin-mediated control systems integrating mitochondria ATPases assessed muscle cells. Mitochondrial distribution function skinned cardiac skeletal muscle fibers dystrophin-deficient (MDX) wild-type mice compared. Laser confocal microscopy revealed disorganized mitochondrial arrays m. gastrocnemius MDX mice, whereas muscles appeared normal group. Irrespective muscle type, absence dystrophin effect maximal capacity oxidative phosphorylation, coupling oxidation phosphorylation. However, myocardium m. soleus, coupling mitochondrial creatine kinase adenine nucleotide translocase attenuated evidenced decreased effect creatine Km ADP reactions oxidative phosphorylation. m. soleus, low Km ADP compared wild-type counterpart found, implies increased permeability nucleotide across mitochondrial outer membrane. normal cardiac fibers 35% ADP flux generated ATPases accessible external pyruvate kinase-phosphoenolpyruvate system, suggests compartmentalized (direct) channeling fraction ADP mitochondria. Compared control, direct ADP transfer increased MDX ventricles. conclusion, data indicate slow-twitch muscle cells, absence dystrophin associated rearrangement intracellular energy feedback signal transfer systems mitochondria ATPases. mechanisms mediated creatine kinases become ineffective, role diffusion adenine nucleotides increases due higher permeability mitochondrial outer membrane ADP enhanced compartmentalization ADP flux.
