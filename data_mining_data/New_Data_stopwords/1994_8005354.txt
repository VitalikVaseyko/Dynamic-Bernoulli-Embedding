 1. generation C2- C3-deuterated L-lactate monitored 13C NMR human erythrocytes exposed D-[1-13C]glucose, D-[2-13C]glucose D-[6-13C]glucose incubated medium prepared D2O. 2. results suggested deuteration C1 D-fructose 6-phosphate phosphoglucoisomerase reaction, deuteration C1 D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate sequence reactions catalyzed triose phosphate isomerase aldolase deuteration C3 pyruvate reaction catalyzed pyruvate kinase lower expected equilibration D2O. 3. Moreover, 40% molecules pyruvate generated glycolysis apparently underwent deuteration C3 interconversion 2-keto acid L-alanine reaction catalyzed glutamate-pyruvate transaminase. 4. occurrence latter process also documented cells exposed exogenous [3-13C]pyruvate. 5. methodological approach proposed provide new tool assess intact cells extent back-and-forth interconversion selected metabolic intermediates.
