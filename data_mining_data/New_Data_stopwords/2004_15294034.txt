 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) key position skeletal muscle metabolism represents entry carbohydrate-derived fuel mitochondria oxidation. PDC regulated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) phosphorylates inactivates complex. PDK exists four isoforms, PDK4 isoform predominantly expressed skeletal heart muscle. PDK4 transcription PDK4 mRNA markedly increased human skeletal muscle prolonged exercise short-term high-intensity prolonged low-intensity exercise. exercise-induced transcriptional response PDK4 enhanced muscle glycogen lowered exercise, intake low-carbohydrate high-fat diet recovery exercise results increased transcription mRNA content PDK4 compared intake high-carbohydrate diet. activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) increased first 2 h low-intensity exercise, followed decrease towards resting levels, line possibility increased PDK4 expressed influences PDH activity already prolonged exercise. PDK4 expression also increased response fasting high-fat diet. Thus, increased PDK4 expression carbohydrate availability low seems contribute sparing carbohydrates preventing carbohydrate oxidation. impact substrate availability PDK4 expression recovery exercise also underlines high metabolic priority given replenishing muscle glycogen stores re-establishing intracellular homeostasis exercise.
