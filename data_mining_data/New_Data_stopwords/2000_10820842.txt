 effects vitamin D3 (as ingredient preparation "Videchol") activity glycolysis enzymes (lactic dehydrogenase, LDH; pyruvate kinase PK; hexokinase HK) pentose phosphate shunt (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), also changes metabolites concentration levels: ATP, NAD+, pyruvate lactate following administration vitamin control group rats animals irradiated low rate ionizing radiation established. "Videchol" administration leads LDH activity decrease within 10 days, HK activity within 20 days decrease PK activity within 5 20 days experiment beginning. low dose radiation conditions reconnection carbohydrates' metabolism glycolisys pentose phosphate pathway erythrocytes observed. administration vitamin D3 component preparation "Videchol" following low rate radiation background facilitates normalization LDG, PK HK activities comparison parameters irradiated rats. studies LDH--reaction kinetics showed redistribution LDH isozymes pattern different K(m) means pyruvate rats subjected joint action low dose chronical radiation "Videchol" occurred.
