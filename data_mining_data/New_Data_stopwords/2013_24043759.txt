 HLA class II-associated autoimmune syndrome rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CD4 cells critical drivers pathogenic immunity. explored metabolic activity RA cells impact cellular function fate. Naive CD4 cells RA patients failed metabolize equal amounts glucose age-matched control cells, generated less intracellular ATP, apoptosis-susceptible. defect attributed insufficient induction 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), regulatory rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme known cause Warburg effect. Forced overexpression PFKFB3 RA cells restored glycolytic flux protected cells excessive apoptosis. Hypoglycolytic RA cells diverted glucose toward pentose phosphate pathway, generated NADPH, consumed intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). PFKFB3 deficiency also constrained ability RA cells resort autophagy alternative means provide energy biosynthetic precursor molecules. PFKFB3 silencing overexpression identified novel extraglycolytic role enzyme autophagy regulation. essence, cells RA patients, even naive state, metabolically reprogrammed insufficient up-regulation glycolytic activator PFKFB3, rendering energy-deprived, ROS- autophagy-deficient, apoptosis-sensitive, prone undergo senescence.
