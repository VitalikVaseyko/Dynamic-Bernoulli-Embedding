 Although deaminoneuraminic acid KDN glycotope (2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid) expressed glycoconjugates range evolutionary diversity bacteria man, little information novel sugar synthesized. Accordingly, biosynthetic studies initiated trout testis, organ rich KDN, determine sialic acid formed. studies shown pathway consists following three sequential reactions: 1) Man + ATP --> Man-6-P + ADP; 2) Man-6-P + PEP --> KDN-9-P + P(i); 3) KDN-9-P --> KDN + P(i). Reaction 1, catalyzed hexokinase, 6-O-phosphorylation mannose form D-mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P). Reaction 2, catalyzed KDN-9-phosphate (KDN-9-P) synthetase, condenses Man-6-P phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) form KDN-9-P. Reaction 3, catalyzed phosphatase, dephosphorylation KDN-9-P yield free KDN. known kinase specific Man (Reaction 1) phosphatase specific KDN-9-P (Reaction 3) may exist tissues actively synthesizing KDN. study, KDN-9-P synthetase, enzyme previously described, identified least one key enzyme specific KDN biosynthetic pathway. enzyme purified 50-fold rainbow trout testis characterized. molecular weight enzyme estimated 80,000, activity maximum neutral pH presence Mn(2+). N-Acetylneuraminic acid 9-phosphate (Neu5Ac-9-P) synthetase, catalyzes condensation N-acetyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphate phosphoenol-pyruvate produce Neu5Ac-9-P, co-purified KDN-9-P synthetase. Substrate competition experiments revealed, however, syntheses KDN-9-P Neu5Ac-9-P catalyzed two separate synthetase activities. significance studies takes added importance recent discovery level free KDN elevated human fetal cord matched adult red blood cells ovarian cancer cells (Inoue, S., Lin, S-L., Chang, T., Wu, S-H., Yao, C-W., Chu, T-Y., Troy, F. A., II, Inoue, Y. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27199-27204). unexpected finding emphasizes need understand fully role free KDN KDN-glycoconjugates may play normal hematopoiesis malignancy.
