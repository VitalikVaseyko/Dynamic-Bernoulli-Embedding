 phosphotransfer mechanism PYKs (pyruvate kinases) studied detail, mechanism intrinsic decarboxylase reaction catalysed PYKs still unknown. 1H NMR used present study follow OAA (oxaloacetate) decarboxylation trypanosomatid human PYKs confirming decarboxylase activity conserved across distantly related species. Crystal structures TbPYK (Trypanosoma brucei PYK) complexed product decarboxylase reaction (pyruvate), series substrate analogues (D-malate, 2-oxoglutarate oxalate) show OAA analogues bind kinase active site similar binding modes, confirming decarboxylase kinase activities share common site substrate binding catalysis. Decarboxylation OAA monitored NMR TbPYK relatively low turnover values 0.86 s-1 1.47 s-1 absence presence F26BP (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) respectively. Human M1PYK (M1 isoform PYK) measured turnover value 0.50 s-1. X-ray structures explain decarboxylation activity specific OAA general alpha-oxo acid analogues. Conservation decarboxylase reaction across divergent species consequence piggybacking conserved kinase mechanism requires stabilized enol intermediate.
