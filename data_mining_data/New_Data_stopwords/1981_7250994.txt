 Aldolase pyruvate kinase isozymes investigated cultured hepatocytes fetal, regenerating, 2-acetyl-aminofluorene-fed rat liver well epithelial liver cell lines. results show that: (a) cell proliferation prolonged expression specific isozymes found cultured hepatocytes 17-day old fetuses; (b) fetal type pyruvate kinase expressed regenerating carcinogen-treated liver temporarily lost cultured hepatocytes regenerating liver; (c) adult type aldolase pyruvate kinase absent one epithelial cell line derived carcinogen-treated liver hepatoma tissue cell (HTC) line found Faza clone Reuber H35 cell line 50 first passages vitro; (d) isozyme pattern pyruvate kinase always strongly shifted aldolase. observations suggest that: (a) hepatocytes carcinogen-treated liver exhibit lack ability proliferate primary culture normal adult hepatocytes; (b) adult hepatocytes produce fetal isozymes without prior cell division; (c) pyruvate kinase stronger marker dedifferentiation (retrodifferentiation) aldolase; (d) regulatory processes isozyme expression different ontogenesis, regeneration, hepatocarcinogenesis.
