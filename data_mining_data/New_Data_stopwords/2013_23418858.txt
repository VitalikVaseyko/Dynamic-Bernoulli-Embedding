 Mass spectrometry used determine number exchangeable backbone amide protons associated rate constants altered rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (rM1-PYK) binds either allosteric inhibitor (phenylalanine) nonallosteric analogue inhibitor. Alanine used nonallosteric analogue binds competitively phenylalanine elicits negligible allosteric inhibition, i.e., negligible reduction affinity rM1-PYK substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate. experimental design expected distinguish changes protein caused effector binding (i.e., changes common upon addition alanine vs phenylalanine) changes associated allosteric regulation (i.e., elicited addition phenylalanine binding, alanine binding). High-quality peptic fragments covering 98% protein identified. Changes number exchangeable protons per peptide rate constant associated exchange highlight regions protein allosteric roles. set allosterically relevant peptides identified technique includes residues previously identified mutagenesis roles allosteric regulation phenylalanine.
