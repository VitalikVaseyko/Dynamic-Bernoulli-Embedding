 BACKGROUND: Metabolic therapy using ketogenic diets (KD) emerging alternative complementary approach current standard care brain cancer management. therapeutic strategy targets aerobic fermentation glucose (Warburg effect), common metabolic malady cancers including brain tumors. KD targets tumor energy metabolism lowering blood glucose elevating blood ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate). Brain tumor cells, unlike normal brain cells, cannot use ketone bodies effectively energy glucose becomes limiting. Although plasma levels glucose ketone bodies used separately predict therapeutic success metabolic therapy, daily glucose levels fluctuate widely brain cancer patients. create difficulty linking changes blood glucose ketones efficacy metabolic therapy. METHODS: program developed (Glucose Ketone Index Calculator, GKIC) tracks ratio blood glucose ketones single value. termed ratio Glucose Ketone Index (GKI). RESULTS: GKIC used compute GKI data published blood glucose ketone levels humans mice brain tumors. results showed clear relationship GKI therapeutic efficacy using ketogenic diets calorie restriction. CONCLUSIONS: GKIC simple tool help monitor efficacy metabolic therapy preclinical animal models clinical trials malignant brain cancer possibly cancers express aerobic fermentation.
