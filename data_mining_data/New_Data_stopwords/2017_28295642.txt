 OBJECTIVE: Here, present 7-year-old patient suffering severe haemolytic anaemia. common cause chronic hereditary non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia red blood cell pyruvate kinase (PK-R) deficiency. red blood cells rely solely glycolysis generate ATP, PK-R deficiency severely impact energy supply cause reduction red blood cell lifespan. determined underlying cause anaemia investigated erythroid precursors patient survive. METHODS: PK activity assays, Western blot Sanger sequencing employed determine underlying cause anaemia. Patient erythroblasts cultured reticulocytes isolated determine PK-R PKM2 contribution glycolytic activity erythrocyte development. RESULTS: found novel homozygous mutation (c.583G>A) PK-R coding gene (PKLR). Although mutation influence PKLR mRNA production, PK-R protein could detected red blood cells precursors. spite absence PK-R, reticulocytes patient exhibited 20% PK activity compared control. Western blotting revealed patient erythroid precursors, like controls, express residual PKM2. CONCLUSIONS: conclude PKM2 rescues glycolysis PK-R-deficient erythroid precursors.
