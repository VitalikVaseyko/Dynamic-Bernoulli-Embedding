 OBJECTIVE: examine antiobesity effect epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), green tea bioactive polyphenol mouse model diet-induced obesity. METHODS: Obesity induced male New Zealand black mice feeding high-fat diet. EGCG purified green tea (TEAVIGO) supplemented diet (0.5 1%). Body composition (quantitative magnetic resonance), food intake, food digestibility recorded 4-week period. Animals killed mRNA levels uncoupling proteins (UCP1-3), leptin, malic enzyme (ME), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK) analysed different tissues. Also investigated acute effects orally administered EGCG (500 mg/kg) body temperature, activity (transponders), energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry). RESULTS: Dietary supplementation EGCG resulted dose-dependent attenuation body fat accumulation. Food intake affected faeces energy content slightly increased EGCG, indicating reduced food digestibility thus reduced long-term energy absorption. Leptin SCD1 gene expression white fat reduced SCD1 UCP1 expression brown fat changed. liver, gene expression SCD1, ME, GK reduced UCP2 increased. Acute oral administration EGCG 3 days effect body temperature, activity, energy expenditure, whereas respiratory quotient night (activity phase) decreased, supportive decreased lipogenesis increased fat oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary EGCG attenuated diet-induced body fat accretion mice. EGCG apparently promoted fat oxidation, fat-reducing effect could entirely explained effect reducing diet digestibility.
