 mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR), evolutionally conserved serine threonine kinase, plays critical role promotion cell growth proliferation via integration cellular environmental cues. adaptive immunity, mTOR pathway orchestrates multiple physiological processes including development homeostasis cells steady state, subsequent activation differentiation upon antigen recognition. Associated fate decisions dynamic reprogramming cell metabolic pathways, naive, activated memory cells defined distinct bioenergetic biosynthetic activities. Emerging evidence indicates mTOR signaling intersects cell metabolism two major levels constitute critical control mechanism cell fate decisions. First, central environmental sensor, mTOR links immune signaling availability nutrients, especially amino acids. Second, mTOR activates specific metabolic pathways cells aerobic glycolysis (also known "Warburg effect") process dependent upon induction transcription factors MYC HIF1alpha. Understanding mTOR interplays cell metabolism dictate cell fates functions provide fundamental insights mechanism immune responses development novel therapeutics immune-mediated diseases. review, summarize current advances mTOR signaling cell metabolism control development, homeostasis, activation differentiation cells.
