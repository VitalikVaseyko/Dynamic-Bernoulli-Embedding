 Muscles ensure locomotion behavior invertebrate vertebrate organisms. highly specialized form using conserved developmental programs. identify new players muscle development screened Drosophila zebrafish gene expression databases orthologous genes expressed embryonic muscles. selected 100 candidates. Among glycolysis gene Pglym78/pgam2, attenuated expression results formation thinner muscles Drosophila embryos. phenotype also observed fast muscle fibers pgam2 zebrafish morphants, suggesting affected myoblast fusion. Indeed, detailed analysis developing muscles Pglym78 RNAi embryos reveals loss fusion-associated actin foci inefficient Notch decay fusion competent myoblasts, known required fusion. addition Pglym78, screen identifies six genes involved glycolysis pyruvate metabolism (Pfk, Tpi, Gapdh, Pgk, Pyk, Impl3). synchronously activated embryonic muscles attenuation expression leads similar muscle phenotypes, characterized fibers reduced size presence unfused myoblasts. data also show cell size triggering insulin pathway positively regulates glycolysis developing muscles blocking insulin target rapamycin pathways phenocopies loss function phenotypes glycolytic genes, leading myoblast fusion arrest reduced muscle size. Collectively, data suggest setting metabolism glycolysis-stimulated biomass production part core myogenic program operates invertebrate vertebrate embryos promotes formation syncytial muscles.
