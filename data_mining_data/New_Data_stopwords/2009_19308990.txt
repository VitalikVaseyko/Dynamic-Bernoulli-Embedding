 Pyruvate kinase M2 (M2-PK) controls rate-limiting step end glycolytic pathway normal proliferating tumor cells. functions M2-PK addition role glycolysis little understood. aim study identify new cellular interaction partners M2-PK order discover novel links M2-PK cellular functions. show SUMO-E3 ligase protein PIAS3 (inhibitor activated STAT3) physically interacts M2-PK isoenzyme M1-PK. Moreover, demonstrate endogenous SUMO-1-M2-PK conjugates exist mammalian cells. Furthermore, show transient expression PIAS3 RING domain mutant PIAS3 (C299S, H301A) consistent nuclear localization M2-PK PIAS3 M2-PK partially co-localize nucleus cells. study suggests link PIAS3 nuclear pyruvate kinase.
