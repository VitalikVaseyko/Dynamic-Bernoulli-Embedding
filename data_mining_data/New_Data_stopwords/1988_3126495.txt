 Pyruvate kinase (PK) four isozymes (L, R, M1, M2) encoded two different genes. Among isozymes, abnormalities liver (L)-type PK considered associated hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia humans. isolated determined full-length sequence human L-type PK cDNA. cDNA contains 1629 base pairs encoding 543 amino acids, 68 base pairs 5'-noncoding sequence, 734 base pairs 3'-noncoding sequence. similarity human rat L-type PK 86.9% nucleotide sequence level 92.4% amino acid sequence level. full-length L-type PK cDNA placed promoter simian virus 40 introduced monkey COS cells. Human L-type PK activity detected extract COS cells classical PK electrophoresis method.
