 Isolated hepatocytes prepared periportal perivenous regions liver 18-h-starved rats. showed characteristics enzyme patterns enhanced rate ureagenesis periportal cells; however, total cellular ATP content unchanged two cell types. Measurements pyruvate kinase flux showed significant difference overall rate two cell types; however, flux phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase significantly higher periportal cells, percentage PEP metabolized pyruvate kinase enhanced perivenous cells. increase partitioning PEP pyruvate kinase could account small percentage difference gluconeogenic flux two cell types, suggesting rate provision PEP principal limiting factor glucose synthesis. flux pyruvate dehydrogenase showed significant metabolic zonation, whereas pyruvate carboxylase flux enhanced periportal zone. partitioning pyruvate pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate dehydrogenase increase 2.8-fold periportal cells compared perivenous cells suggested this, together possible alterations phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, primarily responsible different gluconeogenic rates two zones liver.
