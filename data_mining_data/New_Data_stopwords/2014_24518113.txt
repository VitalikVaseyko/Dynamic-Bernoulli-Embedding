 Ulceration common negative prognostic marker solid tumors including melanoma. signaling basis ulceration elucidated. PHIP found amplified wild-type melanomas, resulting Akt activation aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), associated ulceration. ulceration phenotype likely represents genotype reactive oxygen driven tumor, reactive oxygen drives angiopoietin-2 production, tumor growth, invasion. phenotype amenable pharmacologic intervention.
