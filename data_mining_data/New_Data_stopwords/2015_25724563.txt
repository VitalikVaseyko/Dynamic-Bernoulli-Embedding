 Liver X receptor (LXR)alpha LXRbeta play key roles hepatic de novo lipogenesis regulation lipogenic genes, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). LXRs activate lipogenic gene transcription response feeding, believed mediated insulin. previously shown LXRs targets glucose-hexosamine-derived O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification enhancing ability regulate SREBP-1c promoter activity vitro. elucidate insulin-independent effects feeding LXR-mediated lipogenic gene expression vivo, subjected control streptozotocin-treated LXRalpha/beta(+/+) LXRalpha/beta(-/-) mice fasting-refeeding regime. show hyperglycemic hypoinsulinemic conditions, LXRs maintain ability upregulate expression glycolytic lipogenic enzymes, including glucokinase (GK), SREBP-1c, ChREBPalpha, newly identified shorter isoform ChREBPbeta. Furthermore, glucose-dependent increases LXR/retinoid X receptor-regulated luciferase activity driven ChREBPalpha promoter mediated, least part, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) signaling Huh7 cells. Moreover, show LXR OGT interact colocalize nucleus loss LXRs profoundly reduced nuclear O-GlcNAc signaling ChREBPalpha promoter binding activity vivo. summary, study provides evidence LXRs act nutrient glucose metabolic sensors upstream ChREBP modulating GK expression, nuclear O-GlcNAc signaling, ChREBP expression activity.
