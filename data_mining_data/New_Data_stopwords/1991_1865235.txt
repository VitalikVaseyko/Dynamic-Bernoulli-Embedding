 differential clinical diagnosis X-linked muscular dystrophies (DMD BMD) autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), extremely important genetic counseling, may difficult. aim present report describe clinical laboratory findings patients large families, AR inheritance, attempt characterize better cases diagnosed LGMD compared X-linked forms. main features analysed are: age onset confinement wheelchair, reproductive performance, serum enzymes (CK PK) dystrophin assessment (through immunohistochemistry Western blot). Twenty-two families, 62 affected patients diagnosed limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, included report. 19 families, patients milder clinical course, remaining 3, progression disease continuous clinically similar X-linked DMD ("DMD-like"). high consanguinity rate observed among parents affected patients (77%). major clinical difference observed X-linked AR forms. However, muscle dystrophin found qualitatively quantitatively normal autosomal forms absent abnormal X-linked ones. reproductive performance significantly higher male female patients. addition, surprising finding significantly greater fitness estimated male LGMD cases compared Becker patients comparable age studied center. implications findings discussed.
