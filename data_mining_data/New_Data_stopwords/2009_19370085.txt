 Comparative analysis bioenergetic parameters adult rat cardiomyocytes (CM) HL-1 cells different structure similar cardiac phenotype carried aim revealing importance cell structure regulation energy fluxes. Confocal microscopic analysis showed different mitochondrial arrangement cells. cytochrome content per milligram cell protein decreased HL-1 cells factor 7 compared CM. parallel, respiratory chain complex activities decreased 4-8 times HL-1 cells. contrary, activities glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK) increased HL-1 cells, cells effectively transformed glucose lactate. time, creatine kinase (CK) activity significantly decreased HL-1 cells. conclusion, results study comply assumption contrast CM oxidative phosphorylation predominant provider ATP CK system main carrier energy mitochondria ATPases, HL-1 cells energy metabolism based mostly glycolytic reactions coupled oxidative phosphorylation HK.
