 Cancer cells consume glucose glycolytic fermentation lactate respiration, characteristic known Warburg effect. contrast 36 moles ATP produced respiration, fermentation produces two moles ATP per mole glucose consumed, poses puzzle regard function Warburg effect. production free energy (DeltaG), enthalpy (DeltaH), entropy (DeltaS) per mole linearly varies fraction (x) glucose consumed fermentation frequently estimated around 0.9. Hence, calculation shows that, respect pure respiration, predominant fermentative metabolism decreases around 10% production entropy per mole glucose consumed cancer cells. hypothesize increased fermentation could allow cancer cells accomplish Prigogine theorem trend minimize rate production entropy. According theorem, open cellular systems near steady state could evolve minimize rates entropy production may reached modified replicating cells producing entropy low rate. Remarkably, CO2 concentrations 930 ppm, glucose respiration produces less entropy fermentation, suggests experimental tests validate hypothesis minimization rate entropy production Warburg effect.
