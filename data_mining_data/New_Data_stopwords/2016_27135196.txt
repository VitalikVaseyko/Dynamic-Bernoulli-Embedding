 Methyl 6-aminodeoxy-d-pyranoside-derived platinum(II) glycoconjugates designed synthesized based clinical drug oxaliplatin glucose transporter (GLUT)-mediated tumor targeting. addition substantial improvement water solubility, conjugates exhibited cytotoxicity similar higher oxaliplatin six different human cancer cell lines. GLUT-mediated transport complexes investigated cell-based fluorescence competition assay GLUT-inhibitor-mediated cytotoxicity analysis GLUT-overexpressing human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT29) cell line. antitumor effect aminodeoxypyranoside-conjugated platinum(II) complexes found depend significantly GLUT inhibitor, cellular uptake molecules regulated GLUT-mediated transport. results study demonstrate potential advantages aminodeoxypyranosides sugar motifs glycoconjugation Warburg-effect-targeted drug design. fundamental results also support potential aminodeoxypyranoside-conjugated platinum(II) complexes lead compounds preclinical evaluation.
