 studied three children chronic gastrointestinal disease intravenous hyperalimentation periods time ranging 4 23 months. child found low plasma red blood cell glutathione peroxidase activity. associated, two children tested, marked deficiency serum selenium. plasma glutathione peroxidase levels ranged 4 24% normal red blood cell levels ranged 4 14% normal. intravenous alimentation supplemented sodium selenite (240 micrograms Se/d). Within 4-5 weeks, plasma glutathione peroxidase activity returned normal. Red cell glutathione peroxidase activity remained essentially unchanged 4-6 weeks, increased following 3-4 months. Red cells separated density continuous Percoll-diatrizoate gradient. normal individuals, specific activity glutathione peroxidase differ across gradient despite 2.5-fold difference specific activity pyruvate kinase. studied initially, glutathione peroxidase activity deficient patients change across gradient. red cell enzyme activity increased selenium repletion, highest specific activity initially found top gradient (youngest cells). 3-4 months supplementation, specific activity became equal across gradient. Thus, selenium repletion, rapid increase plasma glutathione peroxidase activity, 4-6 week lag prior increase red cell enzyme activity, increase red cell activity due newly synthesized red cells made presence selenium.
