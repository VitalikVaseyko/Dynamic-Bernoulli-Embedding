 hepatocytes starved streptozocin-induced diabetic rats, vanadate increases glycolytic flux raises levels fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), main regulatory metabolite pathway. effect vanadate Fru-2,6-P2 levels time dose dependent, remains cells incubated calcium-depleted medium. Vanadate also able counteract decrease Fru-2,6-P2 levels produced glucagon, colforsin, exogenous cAMP. However, vanadate modify 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase pyruvate kinase activities, counteract inactivation enzymes induced glucagon. Likewise, Fru-2,6-P2ase activity also affected vanadate. addition, vanadate able increase production lactate CO2 hepatocytes streptozocin-induced diabetic rats incubated presence glucose medium. Vanadate behaves glycolytic effector cells, effect may related ability normalize blood glucose levels diabetic animals.
