 activity serum enzymes, as, creatine kinase (CK), pyruvate kinase (PK), aldolase (ALD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SbDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glutamate-aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamate-alanine aminotransferase (ALT), myokinase (MK), glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI), alkaline phosphatase (AlkP), pseudocholinesterase (PsCHE) isocitrate dehydrogenase gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GTP), determined 256 patients progressing myodystrophy (PMD) (Duchenne's form 125, Becker's form 14, pelvicohumeral form 36, humeroscapulofacial form 19, ocular form 10, rare forms 34, nonidentified forms 13 patients). control group (64 men, 56 women 50 children), activity enzymes found depend patients' sex age. regard parameters, i. e. degree enzyme activity rise frequency pathological values informative CK, PK ALD, enzymes. PMD forms enzymatic activity appeared highest patients pseudohypertrophic malignant form. determining activity five enzymes (CK, ALD, LDH, AST ALT) taking consideration patient's age, onset duration disease one distinguish sick healthy subjects, well various forms PMD.
