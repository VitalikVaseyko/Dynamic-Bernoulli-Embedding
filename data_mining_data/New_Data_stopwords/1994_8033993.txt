 Mitochondria gravid non-gravid guinea pig uteri isolated respiratory rates examined determine responses ATP, ADP creatine. found mitochondria isolated gravid uterus (i) markedly higher respiration rate state 3; (ii) greater activation respiration creatine presence 0.1 mM ATP (iii) elevated specific activity mitochondrial creatine kinase. shown competitive enzyme method, using pyruvate kinase trap ADP, despite presence creatine kinase mitochondria, functional coupling mitochondrial creatine kinase oxidative phosphorylation shown striated muscle. suggested function uterine Mi-CK favour high energy phosphate turnover conditions increased metabolic demand gestating uterine smooth muscle.
