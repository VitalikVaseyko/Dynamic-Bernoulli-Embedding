 effect centpiperalone [2-piperazino-4(3H)-quinazolinone monoacetate], potent hypoglycemic compound glucose oxygen uptake, lactic acid formation rat hemidiaphragms suspended glucose-phosphate buffer Warburg bath 37 degrees C 80 shakes/min studied vitro. Although centpiperalone enhanced glucose oxygen uptake itself, increment parameters seen insulin added simultaneously along centpiperalone. Preincubation hemidiaphragms centpiperalone subsequent incubation insulin indicate potentiation insulin action indicated uptake oxygen glucose. However 16 times diluted serum centpiperalone-treated rats added hemidiaphragms suspended glucose-phosphate buffer, significant increase glycogen content observed compared seen hemidiaphragms addition serum normal untreated alloxanized centpiperalone-fed rats. Definite degranulation B-cells seen centpiperalone-fed rats using aldehyde fuchsin staining technique. data strongly suggest centpiperalone induces hypoglycemia liberation insulin B-cells.
