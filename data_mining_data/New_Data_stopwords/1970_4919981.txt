 Streptococcus diacetilactis required acetate, contained acetate kinase phosphotransacetylase, incorporated radioactive exogenous acetate acetate citrate cell lipids. dl-alpha-Lipoic acid replaced acetate required oxidation pyruvate. Stimulation S. diacetilactis citrate found depend pyruvate oxidation. Resting cells organism produced acetate 73% pyruvate utilized. However, molar growth yields glucose greater aerobic compared anaerobic conditions lipoic acid citrate plus lipoic acid used medium place acetate. Data indicate growth S. diacetilactis limited rate acetyl-coenzyme synthesis, rate synthesis pyruvate higher rate acetate, lack acetyl-coenzyme required growth limits production diacetyl precludes formation adenosine triphosphate acetyl-coenzyme A.
