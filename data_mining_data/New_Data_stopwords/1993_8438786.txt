 Beutler's screening procedure used detect pyruvate kinase deficiency local population. test, hemolysate reagent mixture incubated placed spot filter paper examined fluorescence. Complete nonfluorescence marks reaction endpoint, fluorescence beyond 30 minutes indicates pyruvate kinase deficiency. difficult determine endpoint due uneven sedimentation unhemolyzed red cells spot. modified technique, leukocyte-depleted red cell suspension frozen thawed complete red cell lysis used test. Using techniques, 493 health individuals 126 anemic patients screened pyruvate kinase deficiency. conventional technique, 3.7% remained fluorescent 30 minutes, whereas modified technique, none fluorescent 30 minutes. Quantitative assay indicated samples pyruvate kinase activity levels greater lower limit reference range. also demonstrated blood samples individuals thalassemia trait primarily responsible aberrant results conventional screening procedure.
