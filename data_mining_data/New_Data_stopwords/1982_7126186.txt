 Purified pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex denuded intrinsic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity sedimentation dilute solution (60 munits/ml). Kinase activity restored supernatant fraction prepared high-speed centrifugation rat heart mitochondrial extracts; factor responsible referred kinase/activator. Kinase/activator also assayed ability accelerate NgATP-induced inactivation dilute solutions unprocessed complex (50 munits/ml). assay shown activity kinase/activator heart mitochondria increased 3-6 fold starvation rats 48 h. increase prevented completely cycloheximide treatment prevented partially puromycin treatment rats starvation. concentration kinase/activator heart mitochondria fell 20 h re-feeding 48 h-starved rats; fall correlated increase proportion complex active form. Kinase/activator also extracted ox kidney mitochondria, gel filtration (Sephadex G-100, superfine grade) eluted close void volume. Kinase/activator (ox kidney rat heart) thermolabile, non-diffusable dialysis, inactivated trypsin. results study appear show increased cytoplasmic synthesis starvation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and/or activator kinase.
