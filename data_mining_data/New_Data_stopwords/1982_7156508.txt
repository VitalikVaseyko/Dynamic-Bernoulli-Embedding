 activities (per g tissue) hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase unchanged throughout lactation liver kidney cortex. tissues glucose 6-phosphatase activity decreased late lactation. time fructose diphosphatase activity increased kidney cortex liver. Activities pentose cycle dehydrogenases aspartate aminotransferase tended increase mid lactation. enzymes activities peak lactation similar dry, non-pregnant cows specific response gluconeogenic enzymes. Total hepatic contents enzymes tended increase mid lactation, changes clear cut result increase liver size.
