 Two experimental systems applied study PK-deficient red cells attempt reveal possible membrane abnormalities erythrocytes: (1) glycoprotein self-digestion intact erythrocytes vitro incubation 37 degrees C; (2) red cell sensitivity lytic action mouse macrophages. PK-deficient erythrocytes display precocious normal membrane glycoprotein self-digestion much susceptible normal cytotoxic activity mouse macrophages. latter effect pronounced young old PK-deficient red cells. observations indicate existence membrane abnormality PK-deficient red cells far suspected.
