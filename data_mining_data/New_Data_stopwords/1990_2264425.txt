 Altered glucose metabolism one commonly observed sequelae sepsis septic shock. present investigation undertaken determine role endotoxin (ET) upon hepatocyte glucoregulation, measuring activity pyruvate kinase (PK), key glycolytic enzyme. Hepatocytes exposed endotoxin concentrations known occur vivo sepsis, i.e., 1 X 10(-14) 1 X 10(-8) g/ml. alteration enzyme activities addition epinephrine, glucagon, insulin calcium ionophore A23187 without ET preincubation also examined. ET alone decreased PK activity 12% concentrations tested. basal inhibition enzyme caused epinephrine (-48%) partially blocked ET preincubation 1 X 10(-10) g/ml. ET-(glucagon, calcium ionophore, insulin) interaction. vitro results support pyruvate kinase site hepatic enzyme regulation defect endotoxaemia.
