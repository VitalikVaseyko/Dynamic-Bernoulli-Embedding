 Signal transduction gene regulation determine major reorganization metabolic activities order support cell proliferation. Protein Kinase B (PKB), also known Akt, participates PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, master regulator aerobic glycolysis cellular biosynthesis, two activities shown normal cancer proliferating cells. surprisingly considering relevance cellular metabolism, Akt/PKB often found hyperactive cancer cells. last decade, many efforts made improve understanding control glucose metabolism identification therapeutic window proliferating cancer cells proliferating normal cells. context, modeled link PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, glycolysis, lactic acid production, nucleotide biosynthesis. used computational model compare two metabolic states generated two different levels signaling PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway: one two states represents metabolism growing cancer cell characterized aerobic glycolysis cellular biosynthesis, state represents metabolic network reduced glycolytic rate higher mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. Biochemical reactions link glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway revealed importance controlling dynamics cancer glucose metabolism.
