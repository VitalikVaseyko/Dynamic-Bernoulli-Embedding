 OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) chronic fibrotic disease characterized fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, matrix remodeling lamina propria larynx and/or trachea. Current medical therapies limited poor understanding effector cell's (fibroblasts) cellular biology metabolism. purpose study compare cellular proliferation, function, metabolism normal LTS-derived fibroblasts vitro. hypothesize LTS-derived fibroblasts demonstrate aberrant behavior faster proliferation, increased collagen production, altered metabolic allocation compared normal fibroblasts. STUDY DESIGN: vitro comparative analysis. METHODS: Human biopsies normal iatrogenic LTS tissue (n = 7) obtained, fibroblasts isolated cultured vitro. Cellular proliferation, cellular histology, gene expression, metabolic analyses performed. Statistical analyses comparing normal scar-derived fibroblasts performed. RESULTS: LTS fibroblast proliferation rate, cellular surface area, collagen-1 expression increased compared normal fibroblasts. Cellular metabolic analysis LTS-derived fibroblasts demonstrated reduced oxidative phosphorylation increased glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation ratio compared normal fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Human iatrogenic LTS-derived fibroblasts demonstrated aberrant behavior compared normal fibroblasts. Warburg-like effect revealed, suggesting human iatrogenic LTS fibroblasts drive proliferation aerobic glycolysis. distinct metabolism suggests metabolic inhibitors could reduce fibroblast hyperplasia hypertrophy LTS fibrosis general.
