 Aggressive carcinomas ferment glucose lactate even presence oxygen. particular metabolism, termed aerobic glycolysis, glycolytic phenotype, Warburg effect, discovered Nobel laureate Otto Warburg 1920s. Since times, controversial discussions relevance fermentation glucose tumours took place; however, majority cancer researchers considered Warburg effect non-causative epiphenomenon. Recent research demonstrated, several common oncogenic events favour expression glycolytic phenotype. Moreover, suppression phenotypic features either substrate limitation, pharmacological intervention, genetic manipulation found mediate potent tumour-suppressive effects. discovery transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) enzyme aggressive cancers may deliver missing link interpretation Warburg effect. TKTL1-activity could basis rapid fermentation glucose aggressive carcinoma cells via pentose phosphate pathway, leads matrix acidification, invasive growth, ultimately metastasis. TKTL1 expression certain non-cancerous tissues correlates aerobic formation lactate rapid fermentation glucose, may required prevention advanced glycation end products suppression reactive oxygen species. evidence, activity enzyme Warburg effect protective destructive organism. results place glucose metabolism centre pathogenesis several civilisation related diseases raise concerns high glycaemic index various food components commonly consumed western diets.
