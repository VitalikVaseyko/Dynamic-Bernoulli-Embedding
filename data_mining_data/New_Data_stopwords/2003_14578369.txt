 recently reported pyruvate inhibited translocation activation p53 caused DNA damage due oxidant injury (Lee YJ, Kang IJ, Bunger R, Kang YH. Microvasc Res 66: 91-101, 2003); associated increased expression apoptosis-related bcl-2 decreased expression bax gene. study attempted delineate possible regulatory sites mechanisms antiapoptotic pyruvate, focusing reactive oxygen species-mediated signaling human umbilical vein endothelial cell model. compared effects cytosolic reductant l-lactate malate-aspartate shuttle blocker aminooxyacetate, increase cytosolic NADH, downstream signaling pathway. Hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM H2O2) depleted intracellular total glutathione prevented pyruvate l-lactate aminooxyacetate. Activation caspase-3 cleavage procaspase-6 procaspase-7 strongly inhibited pyruvate markedly enhanced l-lactate aminooxyacetate, implicating redox-related antiapoptotic mechanisms pyruvate. Western blot analysis immunochemical data revealed H2O2-induced transactivation nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) also inhibited pyruvate l-lactate aminooxyacetate. addition, H2O2 downregulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), effects fully reversed pyruvate within 2 h. Collectively, findings indicate pyruvate protect cellular glutathione, thus enhancing cellular antioxidant potential, enhanced antioxidant potential desensitize NF-kappaB transactivation due reactive oxygen species, suggesting possible metabolic redox relations NF-kappaB. Furthermore, pyruvate blocked p38 MAPK pathway activated ERK pathway apparently redox-sensitive manner, may regulate expression genes believed prevent apoptosis promote cell survival. Thus pyruvate may therapeutic potential reducing endothelial dysfunction improving survival oxidative stress.
