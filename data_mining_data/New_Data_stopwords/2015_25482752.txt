 review focuses energy metabolism pollen maturation tube growth updates current knowledge. Pollen tube growth essential male reproductive success extremely fast. Therefore, pollen development tube growth high energy-demanding processes. last years, various publications (including research papers reviews) emphasize importance mitochondrial respiration fermentation male gametogenesis pollen tube elongation. pathways obviously contribute satisfy high energy demand, many studies suggest respiration fermentation pathways generate needed energy. Here, review data show first time addition plastidial glycolysis balancing ATP/NAD(P)H ratio (by malate valves NAD(+) biosynthesis) contribute satisfy energy demand pollen development. Although importance energy generation plastids discounted last years (possibly due controversial opinion existence pollen grains pollen tubes), available data underline prime role pollen maturation tube growth.
