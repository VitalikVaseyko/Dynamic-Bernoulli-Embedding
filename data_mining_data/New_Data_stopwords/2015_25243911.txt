 BACKGROUND: 70% low-grade gliomas carry heterozygous R132H mutation gene coding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). confers enzyme novel ability convert alpha-ketoglutarate 2-hydroxyglutarate, ultimately leading tumorigenesis. major source 2-hydroxyglutarate production glutamine, which, cancer, also source tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) anaplerosis. alternate source anaplerosis pyruvate flux via pyruvate carboxylase (PC), common pathway normal astrocytes. goal study determine whether PC serves source TCA anaplerosis IDH1 mutant cells wherein glutamine used 2-hydroxyglutarate production. METHODS: Immortalized normal human astrocytes engineered express heterozygous mutant IDH1 wild-type IDH1 investigated. Flux pyruvate via PC via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) determined using magnetic resonance spectroscopy probe labeling [2-(1)(3)C]glucose-derived (1)(3)C-labeled glutamate glutamine. Activity assays, RT-PCR western blotting used probe expression activity relevant enzymes. Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data analyzed assess expression enzymes human glioma samples. RESULTS: Compared wild-type cells, mutant IDH1 cells significantly increased fractional flux PC. associated significant increase PC activity expression. Concurrently, PDH activity significantly decreased, likely mediated significantly increased inhibitory PDH phosphorylation PDH kinase 3. Consistent observation cells, analysis TCGA data indicated significant increase PC expression mutant IDH-expressing human glioma samples compared wild-type IDH. CONCLUSIONS: findings suggest changes PC PDH may important part cellular adaptation IDH1 mutation may serve potential therapeutic targets.
