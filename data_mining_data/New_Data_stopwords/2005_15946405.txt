 investigated effect different types dietary protein glycogen content liver skeletal muscle exercise-trained rats. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 100 g; n 6 per group) divided sedentary exercise-trained groups group fed either casein whey protein source dietary protein. Rats exercised groups trained 2 weeks using swimming exercise 120 min/d, 6 d/week. Exercise training resulted increase skeletal muscle glycogen content. Furthermore, whey protein group significantly increased skeletal muscle glycogen content compared casein group. increase glycogen content liver significantly greater rats fed whey protein diet compared fed casein diet. also found whey protein diet increased activity liver glucokinase, whereas decreased activities 6-phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase compared casein diet. However, hepatic total glycogen synthase activity mRNA expression similar two diets. skeletal muscle, whey protein decreased 6-phosphofructokinase activity compared casein. Total glycogen synthase activity skeletal muscle whey protein group significantly higher casein group. present study first demonstrate diet based whey protein may increase glycogen content liver skeletal muscle exercise-trained rats. also observed whey protein regulated glycogen metabolism two tissues different mechanisms.
