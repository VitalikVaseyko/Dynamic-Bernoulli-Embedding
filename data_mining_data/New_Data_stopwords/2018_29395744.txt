 BACKGROUND: Whether arterial tourniquet total knee arthroplasty (TKA) friend foe still debated. Longer ischemia causes hypoxic damage; yet short duration tourniquet may influence outcome. Understanding time-dependent influence tourniquet TKA patients could improve overall outcome safety. purpose study measure tourniquet-induced time-dependent alterations skeletal muscle metabolism TKA establish 'safe tourniquet time.' METHODS: femoral quadriceps muscle 12 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty tourniquet (TKA) measured ischemic response using microdialysis. Lactate, pyruvate, glucose glycerol measured muscle underneath tourniquet, ischemic muscle distally tourniquet opposite muscle reference. RESULTS: Lactate pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) increased time-dependently 15min ischemia. L/P ratio increased faster underneath tourniquet compared ischemic tissue distal tourniquet. Glycerol elevated underneath tourniquet compared ischemic tissue distal tourniquet correlated individual ischemic response. minor increases creatine-kinase, asparagine-aminotransferase, lactate-dehydrogenase observed. Thirty minutes reperfusion normalized lactate levels. CONCLUSIONS: muscle underneath tourniquet suffered ischemia ischemic tissue distal tourniquet. Less 15min ischemia increase ischemic markers. muscle damage occurs longer tourniquet time, likely reversible occurs mainly underneath tourniquet. Fifteen minutes ischemia appears safe.
