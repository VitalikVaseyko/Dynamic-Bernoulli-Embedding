 lowest contents ATP lowest ATP/AMP concentration ratios observed molluscan muscles low rates energy expenditure contraction. highest contents ATP observed extremely aerobic insect flight muscle extremely anaerobic pectoral muscle pheasant domestic fowl. general, lowest ATP/AMP concentration ratios observed muscle variation rate energy utilization small (e.g. molluscan muscles, heart muscle); highest ratios observed muscles variation large (lobster abdominal muscle, pheasant pectoral muscle, insect flight muscles). finding consistent proposed role AMP adenylate kinase reaction regulation glycolysis. However, flight muscle honey-bee ATP/AMP ratio low, glycolysis may regulated factors variation AMP concentration. variation contents arginine phosphate muscle invertebrates much larger variation creatine phosphate muscle vertebrates. contents hexose monophosphates pyruvate are, general, higher muscles vertebrates invertebrates. contents phosphoenolpyruvate similar muscles investigated, except honey-bee 4-10-fold higher. mass-action ratios reactions catalysed phosphoglucoisomerase adenylate kinase similar equilibrium constants reactions. Further, variation mass-action ratios muscles small. concluded enzymes catalyse reactions close equilibrium. However, mass-action ratios reactions catalysed phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase much smaller equilibrium constants. variation ratios different muscles large. concluded enzymes catalyse nonequilibrium reactions. Since variation mass-action ratios reactions catalysed phosphagen kinases (i.e. creatine arginine phosphokinases) small, suggested reactions close equilibrium.
