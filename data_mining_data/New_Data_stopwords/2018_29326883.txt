 Research cancer metabolism recently re-surfaced major focal point cancer field reprogrammed metabolism longer considered mere consequence oncogenic transformation, hallmark cancer. Reprogramming metabolic pathways nutrient sensing elaborate way cancer cells respond high bioenergetic anabolic demands tumorigenesis. Thus, inhibiting specific metabolic pathways defined steps provide potent ways arresting tumor growth. However, animal models clinical observations revealed approach seriously limited extraordinary cellular metabolic plasticity. classical example cancer metabolic reprogramming preference aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, cancers increase glycolytic flux produce lactate regardless presence oxygen. allows cancer cells meet metabolic requirements high rates proliferation. Here, discuss benefits limitations disrupting fermentative glycolysis impeding tumor growth three levels pathway: (i) upstream block level glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), (ii) downstream block level lactate dehydrogenases (LDH, isoforms B), (iii) endpoint block preventing lactic acid export (MCT1/4). Using examples genetic disruption targeting glycolysis studied lab, discuss responses different cancer cell lines terms metabolic rewiring, growth arrest, tumor escape compare broader literature.
