 Skeletal muscle displays enormous plasticity respond contractile activity muscle strength- (ST) endurance-trained (ET) athletes representing diverse states adaptation continuum. Training adaptation viewed accumulation specific proteins. Hence, altered gene expression allows changes protein concentration major importance training adaptation. Accordingly, aim present study quantify acute subcellular responses muscle habitual unfamiliar exercise. 24-h diet/exercise control, 13 male subjects (7 ST 6 ET) performed random order either resistance (8 x 5 maximal leg extensions) endurance exercise (1 h cycling 70% peak O2 uptake). Muscle biopsies taken vastus lateralis rest 3 h exercise. Gene expression analyzed using real-time PCR changes normalized relative preexercise values. cycling exercise, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (ET approximately 8.5-fold, ST approximately 10-fold, P < 0.001), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4; ET approximately 26-fold, ST approximately 39-fold), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; ET approximately 4.5-fold, ST approximately 4-fold), muscle atrophy F-box protein (MAFbx) (ET approximately 2-fold, ST approximately 0.4-fold) mRNA increased groups, whereas MyoD (approximately 3-fold), myogenin (approximately 0.9-fold), myostatin (approximately 2-fold) mRNA increased ET ST (P < 0.05). resistance exercise PDK-4 (approximately 7-fold, P < 0.01) MyoD (approximately 0.7-fold) increased, whereas MAFbx (approximately 0.7-fold) myostatin (approximately 0.6-fold) decreased ET ST. conclude prior training history modify acute gene responses skeletal muscle subsequent exercise.
