 BACKGROUND: tumor microenvironment characterized regions hypoxia acidosis linked poor prognosis. occurs due aberrant vasculature well high rates glycolysis lactate production tumor cells even presence oxygen (the Warburg effect), weakens spatial linkage hypoxia acidosis. METHODS: Five different human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SiHa, FaDuDD, UTSCC5, UTSCC14 UTSCC15) treated hypoxia, acidosis (pH 6.3), combination, gene expression analyzed using microarray. SiHa FaDuDD chosen characterization cell energetics protein synthesis. Total cellular ATP turnover relative glycolytic dependency determined simultaneous measurements oxygen consumption lactate synthesis rates total protein synthesis determined autoradiographic quantification incorporation 35S-labelled methionine cysteine protein. RESULTS: Microarray analysis allowed differentiation genes induced low oxygen normal extracellular pH (pHe), genes induced low oxygen normal low pHe, genes induced low pHe independent oxygen concentration. Several genes found upregulated acidosis independent oxygenation. Acidosis resulted wide-scale change gene expression profiles hypoxia including upregulation genes involved translation process, example Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A, isoform 2 (EIF4A2), Ribosomal protein L37 (RPL37). Acidosis suppressed overall ATP turnover protein synthesis 50%. Protein synthesis, total ATP production, also suppressed hypoxic conditions. dramatic decrease ATP turnover (SiHa) protein synthesis (both cell lines) observed hypoxia low pHe combined. CONCLUSIONS: demonstrate influence hypoxia acidosis causes different responses, gene expression de novo protein synthesis, depending whether two factors induced alone overlapping, important vivo studies take account.
