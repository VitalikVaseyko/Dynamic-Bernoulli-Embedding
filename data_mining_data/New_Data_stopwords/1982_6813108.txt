 effects intravenous salmon calcitonin tissue carbohydrate redox metabolism studied rat kidney situ compared effects EGTA infusion. Calcitonin (0.8 MRC U, bous) caused, 10-20 min, reductive shift cytosolic NAD redox pair, oxidative shift mitochondrial NAD redox pair. also caused stimulation glycolysis cross-over phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate. results reproduced treatments hypocalcemia EGTA thyroparathyroidectomy. effects opposite direction reported effects CaCl2 parathyroid hormone. results suggest kidney calcitonin causes stimulation pyruvate kinase, and/or inhibition phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, effects related changes intracellular calcium.
