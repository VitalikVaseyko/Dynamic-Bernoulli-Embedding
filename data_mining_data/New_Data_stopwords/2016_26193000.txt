 UNLABELLED: Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) extensively studied due promising potential therapeutic agents wide variety diseases, including cancer. However, efficient delivery siRNAs target cells tissues problematic due lack suitable delivery vehicles. work, developed layer-by-layer assembled chitosan-gold nanorods (Chit-Au NRs) siRNA delivery system overcome biological barriers upon systemic injection. platform able protect siRNAs form degradation upon exposure ribonuclease (RNase) serum. Confocal intravital microscopy reveals Chit-Au NRs/siRNAs successfully delivered target cells tissue, efficiently escape endosomal/lysosomal structures. Furthermore, Chit-Au NRs/siRNA found accumulate high levels tumor tissue. delivery system able inhibit oncogene expression (pyruvate kinase isozymeM2, PKM2) MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells, resulting suppression cell proliferation migration. Moreover, anticancer efficacy enhanced NR-mediated photothermal ablation. conclusion, synergistic therapeutic properties Chit-Au NRs/siRNA enable effective suppression cancer growth. STATEMENT SIGNIFICANCE: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy promising therapeutic applications, since expression protein suppressed. However successful implementation siRNA challenging, due rapid degradation, poor intracellular uptake insufficient endosomal escape. Here, developed gold nanorod/chitosan-based delivery vehicle siRNA therapy. platform successfully overcomes afore-mentioned challenges simultaneously used photothermal therapy, due optical properties gold nanorods. show anticancer activity dramatically improved combining thermal therapy gene silencing. Furthermore, Au NRs carrier shows high accumulation tumor tissue high transfection efficiency. manuscript reviewed approved co-authors. research disclosed published consideration publication elsewhere. would appreciate manuscript could reviewed considered publication Acta BIOMATERIALIA.
