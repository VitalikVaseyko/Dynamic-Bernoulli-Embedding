 Recent epidemiological studies suggested link cancer pathophysiological conditions associated hyperinsulinemia. report, address possible role insulin exposure melanocyte transformation. aim, normal melanocytes exposed chronic insulin glucose supplementation (twice standard medium concentration) least 3 wk. 3-wk treatment, melanocytes increased proliferation (doubling time: 2.7 vs. 5.6 days, P < 0.01). 3-wk treatment 3-wk treatment followed 4-wk reculture standard medium, melanocytes able grow soft agar colonies. Treated melanocytes increased DNA content (+8%, P < 0.05), chromosomal aberrations, modified oncoprotein profile: p-Akt expression increased (+32%, P < 0.01), Akt decreased, c-Myc increased (+40%, P < 0.05). PP2A protein expression increased (+42, P < 0.05), PP2A methylation decreased (-42%, P < 0.05), PP2A activity reduced (-27%, P < 0.05). PP2A transcription level increased (ppp2r1a, PP2A subunit A, +44%, P < 0.05). Also, transcriptomic data revealed modifications insr (insulin receptors, +10%, P < 0.05) Il8 (inflammation protein, +99%, P < 0.01). Glycolysis modified increased transcription Pgk1 Hif1a (P < 0.05), decreased transcription Pfkfb3 (P < 0.05), decreased activity pyruvate kinase (P < 0.01), decreased pyruvate cell content assessed (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. addition, methyl group metabolism altered decreased global DNA methylation (-51%, P < 0.01), increased cytosolic protein methylation (+18%, P < 0.05), consistent changes methylated species (1)H-NMR spectra. conclusion, exposure chronic insulin glucose supplementation induces oncogenic changes methyl group metabolism redistribution, may biomarker transformation.
