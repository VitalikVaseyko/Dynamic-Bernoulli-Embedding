 1. pathway synthesis hexose succinate Rhodospirillum rubrum proposed. 2. 2,3-(14)C(2)-labelled succinate fumarate substrates experiments chromatophores soluble enzyme fraction R. rubrum found products succinate metabolism extracts whole cells. also found light-dependent oxidation succinate catalysed chromatophores, enzymes involved soluble fraction. 3. using specific assays presence enzymes required proposed pathway demonstrated extracts specific activities measured. 4. overall rate succinate assimilation measured manometrically. activities enzymes assayed sufficient account overall rate assimilation. concluded proposed pathway represents major mechanism synthesis hexose succinate R. rubrum. 5. formation alanine aspartate observed experiments isotopically labelled substrates, possible synthetic pathways compounds discussed.
