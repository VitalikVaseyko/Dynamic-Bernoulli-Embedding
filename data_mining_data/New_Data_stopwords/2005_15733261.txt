 Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) severe group multiple congenital anomaly disorders known cobblestone lissencephalies. characterized congenital muscular dystrophy conjunction severe brain malformation ocular abnormalities. last 3 years, important progress made towards elucidation genetic causes disorders. Mutations three genes, POMT1, fukutin FKRP, described WWS, together account approximately 20% patients Walker-Warburg. become evident underlying genes may cause broad spectrum phenotypes, ranging limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I WWS. cases, genotype-phenotype correlation recognized. line known proposed functions resolved genes, patients cobblestone lissencephaly show defects O-linked glycosylation glycoprotein alpha-dystroglycan. Perhaps, missing genes underlying remainder unexplained WWS patients also sought pathways involved O-linked protein glycosylation.
