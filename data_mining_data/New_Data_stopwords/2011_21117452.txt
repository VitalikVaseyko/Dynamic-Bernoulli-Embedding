 Mechanism action GII (100 mg/kg body weight, po 15 days) purified fenugreek (T. foenum-graecum) seeds studied sub-diabetic moderately diabetic rabbits. sub-diabetic rabbits change much content total lipids, glycogen proteins liver, muscle heart (glycogen studied heart). However, moderately diabetic rabbits treatment decreased total lipids liver (21%) heart muscle. Total protein content increased (14%) liver negligible change (5-7%) observed heart muscle. Glycogen increased (17%) liver muscle moderately diabetic rabbits (glycogen estimated heart). Among enzymes glycolysis, activity glucokinase affected liver sub-diabetic moderately diabetic rabbits. Phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activity sub-diabetic moderately diabetic rabbits increased (13-50%) indicating stimulation glycolysis. activity gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6-diphosphatase sub-diabetic rabbits decreased liver (15-20%) kidneys. moderately diabetic rabbits treatment GII, glucokinase liver affected much (-9%) increased well muscle (40%). Phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase moderately increased liver muscle (18-23%). gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase decreased reasonably well liver kidneys (22, 32%). Fructose-1,6-diphosphatase decreased slightly (10, 9%) moderately diabetic rabbits. Thus GII seems decrease lipid content liver stimulate enzymes glycolysis (except glucokinase) inhibit enzymes gluconeogenesis liver diabetic especially moderately diabetic rabbits.
