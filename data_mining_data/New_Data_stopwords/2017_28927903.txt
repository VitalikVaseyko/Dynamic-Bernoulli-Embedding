 Nitrogen mustards, chlorambucil (CLB), cause adverse side-effects due ubiquitous distribution non-target organs. minimize toxicity, strategies tumor-targeting drug delivery developed, cytotoxic warhead linked tumor-cell-specific small ligand. Malignant cells exhibit marked glucose avidity accelerated metabolism aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect, recognized hallmark cancer. targeting approach exploiting Warburg effect conjugation CLB 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) previously reported identified two peracetylated glucoconjugates 2 3 promising antitumor activities vivo. results prompted us investigate importance spacer tumor-targeting glucose-based conjugates. report chemical synthesis vitro cytotoxicity evaluation, using 5-member panel human tumor cell lines human fibroblasts, 16 new CLB glucoconjugates alkylating drug attached C-1 position FDG via different linkages. studied structure-activity relationships linker, evidenced positive impact aromatic linker vitro cytotoxicity: compound 51 proved active FDG-CLB glucoside, characterized bis-aromatic spacer tethered CLB amide function.
