 study, possible link innate immune recognition receptor TLR3 metabolic reprogramming Head Neck carcinoma (HNC) cells investigated. effects TLR3 stimulation/knock-down assessed several culture conditions 4 HNC cell-lines cell growth assays, targeted metabolomics, glycolysis assays based time-resolved analysis proton release (Seahorse analyzer). stimulation TLR3 synthetic agonist Poly(A:U) resulted faster growth HNC cells low foetal calf serum conditions. Targeted analysis glucose metabolism pathways demonstrated tendency towards shift tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs cycle) glycolysis anabolic reactions cells treated Poly(A:U). Glycolysis assays confirmed TLR3 stimulation enhanced capacity malignant cells switch oxidative phosphorylation extra-mitochondrial glycolysis. found evidence HIF-1alpha involved process: addition TLR3 agonist resulted higher cell concentration HIF-1alpha protein, even normoxia, whereas knocking-down TLR3 resulted lower concentration, even hypoxia. Finally, assessed TLR3 expression immunohistochemistry series 7 HNSCC specimens found TLR3 detected higher levels tumors displaying hypoxic staining pattern. Overall, results demonstrate TLR3 stimulation induces Warburg effect HNC cells vitro, suggest TLR3 may play role tumor adaptation hypoxia.
