 Oval cells observed experimental models hepatocarcinogenesis function stem cells capable differentiating hepatocytes bile ductular cells. Using markers characterise embryonic hepatocytes, showed oval cells display different patterns gene expression, suggesting mature others. study looked oval cells developing liver, predicting abundant embryonic liver decline number development. Albumin (ALB) serves liver-specific marker, isoenzymes pyruvate kinase, M2-PK L-PK, used identify immature mature hepatocytes, respectively. Small oval-shaped cells expressing ALB, M2-PK L-PK found near vascular spaces portal areas 20-day gestation (E20), E21, newborn, 3-day 1-week-old rat liver. Similar cells expressing ALB M2-PK, L-PK seen periportally adult liver. abundant early embryonic liver decrease number development few, located periportally, persist adult. Oval cells, located periportally days commencing choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet, co-express ALB M2-PK. similarity respect markers, morphology location suggests oval-shaped cells may progenitors oval cells.
