 Despite broad medical application, induction artificial hypometabolism vitro biochemical consequence rarely addressed. study aimed elucidate whether 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM) induces hypometabolism vitro model activation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) whether leads switch primary fuel carbohydrates lipids observed vivo models. Mouse C2C12 myotube T1AM, natural derivative thyroid hormone, used study. oxygen consumption rate (OCR) decreased dose-dependent manner response 0-100 muM T1AM 10 h. Upon 6-h exposure 75 muM T1AM, OCR reduced 60 vs. ~ 95% control. intracellular [AMP]/[ATP] 1.35-fold higher T1AM-treated cells. RT-PCR immunoblotting analyses revealed treated cells upregulated p-AMPK/AMPK (1.8-fold), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 mRNA, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, downregulated acetyl CoA carboxylase (0.4-fold) pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. treated cells darker periodic acid-Schiff staining 1.2-fold greater glycogen content controls. Taken together, hypometabolic response myotubes T1AM dramatic accompanied increases relative abundance AMP AMPK activation, fuel choice favoring lipids carbohydrates. results consistent general trends observed rodent models true hibernators.
