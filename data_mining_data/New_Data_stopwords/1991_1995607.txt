 Insulin action gene expression glucose-dependent -independent. Accumulation aldolase B mRNA unidentified 5.4-kilobase mRNA well accumulation L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs (Decaux, J.F., Antoine, B., Kahn, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11584-11590) cultured hepatocytes isolated fasted rats require presence glucose insulin, agents effective individually. contrast, maintaining amount albumin transferrin mRNAs hepatocytes requires presence insulin alone, glucose effect itself. Transcription albumin gene, investigated run-on assay, active presence insulin alone, without glucose, whereas transcription aldolase B gene stimulated glucose insulin together, insulin glucose alone. addition, stability albumin aldolase B mRNAs cultured hepatocytes lowered absence glucose insulin together compared stability presence one agents. results confirm transduction insulin signal occurs via distinct pathways; one pathways could involve secondary insulin-dependent modification metabolite concentration, whereas pathways could directly related activity(ies) occupied insulin receptor.
