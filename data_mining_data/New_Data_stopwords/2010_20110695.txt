 BACKGROUND: Different works suggested hypertrophied heart energy metabolic pathway shifts glycolysis. aim evaluate using proteomics expression proteins associated different energetic metabolic pathways hypertrophied left ventricles spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). METHODS: 24-weeks-old SHR stable hypertension established left ventricle hypertrophy used. Normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats used control. Proteins left ventricles analyzed 2-dimensional electrophoresis identified comparison virtual rat heart proteomic map mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Enoyl-CoA hydratase expression, enzyme involved fatty acid beta-oxidation, reduced whereas expression beta-oxidation enzymes, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase mitochondrial precursor acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase, increased hypertrophied left ventricles. expression two enzymes involved first steps glycolysis, fructose bisphosphate aldolase triosephosphate isomerase, reduced left ventricle SHR. Pyruvate dehydrogenase expression, enzyme involved glucose oxidation, enhanced hypertrophied ventricles whereas proteins tricarboxylic acid cycle modified. Proteins involved mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation overexpressed whereas alpha-subunit mitochondrial precursor ATP synthase downexpressed. CONCLUSIONS: Several proteins involved main energy metabolic pathways downexpressed. Moreover, results seem suggest probably neither fatty acid beta-oxidation glycolysis sources energy hypertrophied left ventricle.
