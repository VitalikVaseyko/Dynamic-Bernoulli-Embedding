 morpheein model allosteric regulation draws attention proteins exist equilibrium functionally distinct assemblies where: one subunit conformation assembles one multimer; different subunit conformation assembles different multimer; various multimers dynamic equilibrium whose position modulated ligands bind multimer-specific ligand binding site. case study porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) illustrates equilibrium holds lessons disease mechanisms, drug discovery, understanding drug side effects, identifying proteins wherein drug discovery efforts might focus quaternary structure dynamics. morpheein model allostery proposed applicable wide assortment disease-associated proteins (Selwood, T., Jaffe, E., (2012) Arch. Bioch. Biophys, 519:131-143). Herein discuss quaternary structure dynamics aspects drug discovery disease-associated putative morpheeins phenylalanine hydroxylase, HIV integrase, pyruvate kinase, tumor necrosis factor alpha. Also highlighted quaternary structure equilibrium transthyretin successful drug discovery efforts focused controlling quaternary structure dynamics.
