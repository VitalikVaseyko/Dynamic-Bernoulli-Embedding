 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) important mitochondrial enzyme blocks production acetyl-CoA selectively inhibiting activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation. PDK effectively therapeutic target cancer cells, physiological roles PDK phytopathogens largely unknown. address gaps, PDK gene (FgPDK1) isolated Fusarium graminearum economically important pathogen infecting cereals. deletion FgPDK1 F. graminearum resulted increase PDH activity, coinciding several phenotypic defects, growth retardation, failure perithecia conidia production, increase pigment formation. DeltaFgPDK1 mutants showed enhanced sensitivity osmotic stress cell membrane-damaging agent. Physiological detection indicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation plasma membrane damage (indicated PI staining, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage) occurred DeltaFgPDK1 mutants. deletion FgPDK1 also prohibited production deoxynivalenol (DON) pathogenicity F. graminearum, may resulted decrease expression Tri6. Taken together, study firstly identified vital roles FgPDK1 development phytopathogen F. graminearum, may provide potentially novel clue target-directed development agricultural fungicides.
