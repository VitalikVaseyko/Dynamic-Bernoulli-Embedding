 Effect adrenaline (A) noradrenaline (NA) release enzymes studied isolated human adipocytes incubated Krebs-Hanseleit buffer albumins saturated fatty acids albumins, fatty acids partly removed, added. incubation fluid activity lactic dehydrogenase, malic dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase determined. Besides that, effects adrenaline noradrenaline content non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) adipocytes release glycerol incubation fluid studied. NA stimulated release examined enzymes incubation medium. amount released enzymes, determined basis changes activity incubation medium, depended degree albumin saturation fatty acids. Increased release enzymes incubation fluid associated rise content NEFA adipocytes. Gycerol release incubation medium independent degree albumin saturation fatty acids.
