 Escherichia coli strain expressing three recombinant enzymes, i.e., cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP) kinase, sialic acid aldolase cytidine 5'-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) synthetase, utilized biocatalyst production CMP-NeuAc. recombinant E. coli extract whole cells catalyzed production CMP-NeuAc CMP (20 mM), N-acetylmannosamine (40 mM), pyruvate (60 mM), ATP (1 mM), acetylphosphate (60 mM), resulting 90% conversion yield based initial CMP concentration used. confirmed endogenous acetate kinase catalyze ATP regeneration conversion CMP CDP also conversion CDP CTP. hand, endogenous pyruvate kinase polyphosphate kinase could regenerate ATP efficiently. addition exogenous acetate kinase reaction mixture containing cell extract increased conversion rate CMP CMP-NeuAc 1.5-fold, addition exogenous inorganic pyrophosphatase influence reaction. E. coli strain could also employed enzyme source situ regeneration CMP-NeuAc sialyltransferase catalyzed reaction. 90% conversion yield alpha2,3-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine obtained N-acetyllactosamine (20 mM), CMP (2 mM), N-acetylmannosamine (40 mM), pyruvate (60 mM), ATP (1 mM), acetyl phosphate (80 mM) using recombinant E. coli extract alpha2,3-sialyltransferase.
