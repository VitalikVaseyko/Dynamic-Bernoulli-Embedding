 substrate specificity preparation phosphoprotein phosphatase (Mr = 32 000) rat liver investigated. Phosphopeptides based structure Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala-Glx-Leu Ala-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-Ser-Gly-Ser(P)-Val-Tyr-Glu-Pro-Leu-Lys used. phosphopeptides correspond phosphorylation sites rat liver pyruvate kinase (type L) beta subunit rabbit muscle phosphorylase b kinase, respectively. decrease apparent Km values concomitant increase Vmax values observed number amino acyl residues phosphoseryl residue respective phosphopeptides increased 2 4, 5, 6. phosphopeptides investigated generally showed apparent Km values higher values obtained phosphopyruvate kinase. Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala Gly-Ser(P)-Val-Tyr appeared shortest phosphopeptides could dephosphorylated rapidly. findings support hypothesis small part phosphoprotein may sufficient fulfill minimal requirements dephosphorylation.
