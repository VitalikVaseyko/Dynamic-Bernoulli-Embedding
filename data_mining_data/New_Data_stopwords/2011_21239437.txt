 Obesity-dependent insulin resistance type 2 diabetes mellitus closely associated decreased glucose utilization down-regulation hepatic glycolytic enzymes expression. Previously, showed DNA hypermethylation involved age-dependent susceptibility hepatic insulin resistance diabetes. However, cannot distinguish whether age-related obesity contributes DNA hypermethylation natural aging rats. present study, hypothesize DNA methylation plays crucial role regulation glycolytic enzymes high-fat diet-induced obesity. Here, report DNA hypermethylation correlated decline hepatic glucokinase (Gck) L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) expression high-fat diet-induced obese rats compared control diet group. Down-regulation Gck LPK expression reversed 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine cell model steatosis. novel observations indicate DNA methylation involved development metabolic diseases, obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, suggesting hypermethylation level Gck LPK promoters may useful parameter evaluation obesity-induced insulin resistance fatty liver.
