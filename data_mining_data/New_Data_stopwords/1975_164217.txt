 kinetics glycerol uptake perfused rat liver determined according model includes membrane transport, intracellular phosphorylation competitive inhibition glycerol phosphorylation L-glycerol 3-phosphate. membrane transport obeys first-order kinetics concentrations 10 mM affluent medium. K-m glycerol phosphorylation 10 muM K-i L-glycerol 3-phosphate inhibition 50 muM. maximum activity (V) 3.70 mumoles/min per g liver wet wt. results similar vitro kinetics glycerol kinase, except K-i found somewhat lower intact organ. low glycerol concentrations, steep concentration gradient exists across liver cell membrane. increase lactate pyruvate concentration ratio glycerol metabolism related actual concentration L-glycerol 3-phosphate, rate glycerol uptake.
