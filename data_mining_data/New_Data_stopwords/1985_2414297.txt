 Regulation expression hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase gene insulin dietary fructose studied diabetic rats. Insulin increased levels putative nuclear RNA precursor species enzyme parallel total cellular pyruvate kinase L mRNA. changes occurred slowly induced dietary fructose. Insulin caused 3-fold increase transcription pyruvate kinase L gene 6 h 6-fold increase 16 h. increase caused insulin inhibited glucagon, adrenalectomy. Cycloheximide inhibited induction caused insulin, suggesting insulin may stimulate transcription pyruvate kinase L gene stimulating synthesis unknown protein. hand, feeding fructose effect transcription pyruvate kinase L gene. previously showed increases levels putative nuclear RNA precursor species pyruvate kinase L fructose feeding preceded changes levels cytosolic pyruvate kinase L mRNA (Inoue, H., Noguchi, T., Tanaka, T. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 96, 1457-1462). Thus, dietary fructose may increase levels pyruvate kinase L mRNA stabilizing nuclear RNA species. Glucagon inhibited increase pyruvate kinase L mRNA caused dietary fructose. However, plasma levels glucagon thyroid hormones decreased diabetic rats fructose feeding. addition, treatment triiodo-L-thyronine caused change pyruvate kinase L mRNA level. Furthermore, adrenalectomy impair enzyme induction fructose diabetic rats. Thus, effect fructose pyruvate kinase L seems directly liver.
