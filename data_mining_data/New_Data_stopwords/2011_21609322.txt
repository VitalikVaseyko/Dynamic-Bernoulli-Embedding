 LXR (liver X receptor) PPARalpha (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha) nuclear receptors control expression genes involved glucose lipid homoeostasis. Using wild-type PPARalpha-null mice fed LXR-agonist-supplemented diet, present study analysed impact pharmacological LXR activation expression metabolically important genes skeletal muscle, testing hypothesis LXR activation modulate PPAR action skeletal muscle manner dependent nutritional status. fed state, LXR activation promoted gene profile favouring lipid storage glucose oxidation, increasing SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1) expression down-regulating PGC-1alpha (PPARgamma co-activator-1alpha) PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) expression. PPARalpha deficiency enhanced LXR stimulation SCD1 expression, facilitated elevated SREBP-1 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1) expression. However, LXR-mediated down-regulation PGC-1alpha PDK4 opposed reversed PPARalpha deficiency. fasting, prior LXR activation augmented PPARalpha signalling heighten FA (fatty acid) oxidation decrease glucose oxidation augmenting fasting-induced up-regulation PGC-1alpha PDK4 expression, effects opposed PPARalpha deficiency. Starvation-induced down-regulation SCD1 expression opposed antecedent LXR activation wild-type mice, effect enhanced PPARalpha deficiency, may elicit increased channelling FA triacylglycerol limit lipotoxicity. results also identified potential regulatory links protein deacetylases SIRT1 (sirtuin 1) SIRT3 PDK4 expression muscle fasted mice, requirement PPARalpha. summary, therefore propose LXR-PPARalpha signalling axis acts metabolostatic regulatory mechanism optimize substrate selection disposition skeletal muscle according metabolic requirement.
