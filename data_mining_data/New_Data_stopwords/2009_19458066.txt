 cancer cells predominantly produce energy glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation via tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, even presence adequate oxygen supply (Warburg effect). However, little reported regarding direct measurements global metabolites clinical tumor tissues. Here, applied capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry, enables comprehensive quantitative analysis charged metabolites, simultaneously measure levels tumor grossly normal tissues obtained 16 colon 12 stomach cancer patients. Quantification 94 metabolites colon 95 metabolites stomach involved glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA urea cycles, amino acid nucleotide metabolisms resulted identification several cancer-specific metabolic traits. Extremely low glucose high lactate glycolytic intermediate concentrations found colon stomach tumor tissues, indicated enhanced glycolysis thus confirmed Warburg effect. Significant accumulation amino acids except glutamine tumors implied autophagic degradation proteins active glutamine breakdown energy production, i.e., glutaminolysis. addition, significant organ-specific differences found levels TCA cycle intermediates, reflected dependency tissue aerobic respiration according oxygen availability. results uncovered unexpectedly poor nutritional conditions actual tumor microenvironment showed capillary electrophoresis coupled mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, capable quantifying levels energy metabolites tissues, could powerful tool development novel anticancer agents target cancer-specific metabolism.
