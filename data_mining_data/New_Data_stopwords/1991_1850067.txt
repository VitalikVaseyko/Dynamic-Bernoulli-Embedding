 Homogenates prepared temporal cortex hippocampus individuals histopathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease exhibited reduced vitro cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation synapsin I, neuronal phosphoprotein. One specific phosphorylation site (site 1) affected two sites, phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin kinase II, exhibited differences. phosphoproteins pyruvate dehydrogenase, show differences. reductions observed either cerebellum thalamus Alzheimer's disease brain. Analysis immunoblots indicated reductions caused decrease absolute amounts protein. reduced AD synapsin phosphorylation overcome addition purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. differences detected total cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity control Alzheimer samples. However, dephosphorylation synapsin prior vitro phosphorylation reversed differences observed control AD homogenates. Thus, reduced vitro phosphorylation synapsin Alzheimer homogenate reflects reduced phosphorylatability protein due either increased phosphate content alteration phosphorylation site.
