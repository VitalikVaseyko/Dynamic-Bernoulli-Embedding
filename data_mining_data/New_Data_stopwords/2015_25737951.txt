 OBJECTIVE: Dysregulated muscle metabolism cardinal feature human insulin resistance (IR) associated diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, specific reactions contributing abnormal energetics metabolic inflexibility IR unknown. METHODS: utilize flux balance computational modeling develop first systems-level analysis IR metabolism fasted fed states, varying nutrient conditions. systematically perturb metabolic network identify reactions reproduce key features IR-linked metabolism. RESULTS: reduced glucose uptake major hallmark IR, model-based reductions either extracellular glucose availability uptake alter metabolic flexibility, thus sufficient fully recapitulate IR-linked metabolism. Moreover, experimentally-reduced flux single reactions reproduce key features IR-linked metabolism. However, dual knockdowns pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), combination reduced lipid uptake lipid/amino acid oxidation (ETFDH), reduce ATP synthesis, TCA cycle flux, metabolic flexibility. Experimental validation demonstrates robust impact dual knockdowns PDH/ETFDH cellular energetics TCA cycle flux cultured myocytes. Parallel analysis transcriptomic metabolomics data humans IR T2D demonstrates downregulation PDH subunits upregulation inhibitory kinase PDK4, would predicted decrease PDH flux, concordant model. CONCLUSIONS: results indicate complex interactions multiple biochemical reactions contribute metabolic perturbations observed human IR, PDH complex plays key role metabolic phenotypes.
