 Macromolecules components physiological mitochondrial environment substituted dextrans different molecular weight. addition 10% dextran (molecular weights varying 20 500 kDa) affected neither basic mitochondrial parameters (state 4 state 3 respiration) kinetic properties soluble kinases. significant increase 10% dextran however observed voltage sensitivity isolated porin reconstituted planar bilayers. pores adapted low conducting state already voltage 10 mV. effect macromolecules may explain higher diffusion resistance adenine nucleotides across outer membrane observed different experiments: (i) Michaelis constant adenylate kinase inter-membrane space increased, contrast soluble enzyme, 118 +/- 10 microM 193 +/- 20 microM ADP, (ii) presence competing external pyruvate kinase, mitochondrial utilization ADP, produced adenylate kinase inter-membrane space, improved 3-fold suggesting reduced ADP diffusion outer mitochondrial compartment. influence various dextrans correlated increase molecular weight dextrans. effect kinetic constants dependent dextran concentration terms weight molarity. oncotic pressure viscosity dextran solutions different molecular weight showed comparable dependence. general, data indicate outer membrane pore responds increased oncotic pressure reducing adenine nucleotide permeability. suggests physiological existence third adenine nucleotide compartment two envelope membranes may important especially high metabolic fluxes.
