 pyruvate kinase isoforms PKM1 PKM2 alternatively spliced products PKM2 gene. PKM2, PKM1, alters glucose metabolism cancer cells contributes tumorigenesis mechanisms explained known biochemical activity. show PKM2 gene transcription activated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). PKM2 interacts directly HIF-1alpha subunit promotes transactivation HIF-1 target genes enhancing HIF-1 binding p300 recruitment hypoxia response elements, whereas PKM1 fails regulate HIF-1 activity. Interaction PKM2 prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) enhances PKM2 binding HIF-1alpha PKM2 coactivator function. Mass spectrometry anti-hydroxyproline antibody assays demonstrate PKM2 hydroxylation proline-403/408. PHD3 knockdown inhibits PKM2 coactivator function, reduces glucose uptake lactate production, increases O(2) consumption cancer cells. Thus, PKM2 participates positive feedback loop promotes HIF-1 transactivation reprograms glucose metabolism cancer cells.
