 found pyruvate kinases two different regulatory characteristics distributed among oral streptococci. pyruvate kinases Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus bovis activated glucose 6-phosphate, whereas enzymes Streptococcus sanguis Streptococcus mitis activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) S. sanguis NCTC 10904 purified, giving single band sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. enzyme molecular weight 250,000 260,000 consisted four identical subunits. Whereas pyruvate kinase S. mutans completely dependent glucose 6-phosphate (K. Abbe T. Yamada, J. Bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), enzyme S. sanguis activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. presence 0.5 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, saturation curves substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate ADP, hyperbolic, Km values 0.13 0.30 mM, respectively. Without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves substrates sigmoidal. GDP, IDP, UDP could replace ADP. Like enzyme S. mutans, enzyme S. sanguis required divalent cation, Mg2+ Mn2+, monovalent cation, K+ NH4+, activity, strongly inhibited Pi. concentration Pi increased, half-saturating concentration Hill coefficient fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increased. remarkable fluctuation intracellular levels fructose 1,6-bisphosphate phosphoenolpyruvate observed cells growing glucose limitation nitrogen limitation implies intracellular concentration fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, cooperation Pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity S. sanguis vivo.
