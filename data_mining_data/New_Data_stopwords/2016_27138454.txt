 Despite success colonoscopy screening, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one common deadly cancers, CRC incidence rising countries screening routine populations recently switched traditional diets western diets. Diet energy balance influence CRC multiple mechanisms. modulate composition function gut microbiota, prodigious metabolic capacity produce oncometabolites tumor-suppressive metabolites depending, part, dietary factors digestive components present GI tract. Gut microbiota also profound effect immune cells lamina propria, influences inflammation subsequently CRC. Nutrient availability, outcome diet energy balance, determines abundance certain energy metabolites essential co-factors epigenetic enzymes therefore impinges upon epigenetic regulation gene expression. Aberrant epigenetic marks accumulate CRC, epimutations selected drive tumorigenesis causing transcriptome profiles diverge cell origin. instances, mechanisms intertwined exemplified dietary fiber metabolized colonic bacteria butyrate, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor epigenetically upregulates tumor-suppressor genes CRC cells anti-inflammatory genes immune cells.
