 activity several enzymes regulatory importance pathways glycolysis, gluconeogenesis lipogenesis investigated placenta liver pregnant rats liver non-pregnant female rats. rats received daily hormonal treatments Days 15 17 pregnancy enzyme activities measured Day 18. Chorionic gonadotropin induced minor changes enzyme activity, apart decrease activity hepatic enzymes lipogenesis non-pregnant rats. Triamcinolone induced marked increase enzymes gluconeogenesis decrease activity pyruvate kinase liver pregnant non-pregnant rats; contrast, inverse changes activity, enzymes observed placenta. response placenta considered arise direct hormone effect, accompanying hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia. Triamcinolone also increased activity hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase pregnant non-pregnant rats, whereas reduced activity enzyme placenta. Estrogen produced changes similar triamcinolone liver placenta, except depressed activity acetyl-CoA carboxylase tissues. Progesterone little effect placental hepatic enzymes. general, changes induced hormones placenta affected fewer enzymes liver, less extensive magnitude necessarily direction liver. indicates regulatory placental enzymes subject specific control mechanisms necessarily influenced direct hormone action.
