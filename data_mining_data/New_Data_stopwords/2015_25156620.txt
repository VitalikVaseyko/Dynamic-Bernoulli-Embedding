 Protein histidine phosphorylation increasingly recognized critical posttranslational modification (PTM) central metabolism cell signaling. Still, detection phosphohistidine (pHis) proteome remained difficult due scarcity tools enrich identify labile PTM. address this, report first global proteomic analysis pHis proteins, combining selective immunoenrichment pHis peptides bioinformatic strategy based mechanistic insight pHis peptide gas-phase fragmentation LC-MS/MS. show collision-induced dissociation (CID) pHis peptides produces prominent characteristic neutral losses 98, 80, 116 Da. Using isotopic labeling studies, also demonstrate 98 Da neutral loss occurs via gas-phase phosphoryl transfer pHis peptide C-terminal alpha-carboxylate Glu/Asp side chain residues present. exploit property, developed software tool screens LC-MS/MS spectra potential matches pHis-containing peptides based neutral loss pattern. tool integrated proteomics workflow identification endogenous pHis-containing proteins cellular lysates. illustration strategy, analyzed pHis peptides glycerol-fed mannitol-fed Escherichia coli cells. identified known number previously speculative pHis sites inferred homology, predominantly phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar transferase system (PTS). Furthermore, identified two new sites histidine phosphorylation aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE) pyruvate kinase (PykF) enzymes, previously known bear modification. study lays groundwork future pHis proteomics studies bacteria organisms.
