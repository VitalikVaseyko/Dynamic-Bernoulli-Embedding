 radioimmunoassay specific liver pyruvate kinase used determine mechanism(s) involved insulin stimulation enzyme activity chronically diabetic rats. Rats, made diabetic alloxan, fed high-carbohydrate (50%-sucrose) fat-free diet treated insulin 12, 36 60 h. Livers removed various times, piece kept determination glycogen, remainder homogenized. 100000 g supernatant prepared used determination pyruvate kinase activity quantity. Glycogen increased maximum approx. 7% 12 h insulin treatment, maintained elevated value 60 h. Liver pyruvate kinase activity, depressed diabetes, respond insulin 36 h treatment, substantial increase occurring 60 h. Radioimmunoassay data indicated increase activity concomitant substantial increase quantity enzyme moderate increase specific activity. results demonstrate dual mechanism, i.e. increase quantity specific activity enzyme, regulates insulin-mediated stimulation liver pyruvate kinase diabetic rat.
