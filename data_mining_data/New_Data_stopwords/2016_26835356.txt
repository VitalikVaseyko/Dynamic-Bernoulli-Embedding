 support high proliferation, majority cancer cells undergo fundamental metabolic changes increasing glucose uptake shifting glycolysis ATP production expense far efficient mitochondrial energy production oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), first glance paradox. phenomenon known Warburg effect. However, enhanced glycolysis necessary provide building blocks anabolic growth. Apart generation ATP, intermediates glycolysis serve precursors variety biosynthetic pathways essential cell proliferation. last 10-15 years field tumor metabolism experienced enormous boom interest. well established tumor suppressor genes oncogenes often play central role regulation cellular metabolism. Therefore, significantly contribute manifestation Warburg effect. much attention focused adult solid tumors, far comparatively little effort directed elucidation mechanism responsible Warburg effect childhood cancers. review focus metabolic pathways neuroblastoma (NB) Wilms tumor (WT), two frequent solid tumors children. tumor types show alterations OXPHOS system glycolytic features. Chromosomal alterations activation oncogenes like MYC inactivation tumor suppressor genes like TP53 part explain changes energy metabolism cancers. strict dependence cancer cells glucose metabolism fairly common feature among otherwise biologically diverse types cancer. Therefore, inhibition glycolysis starvation cancer cells glucose deprivation via high-fat low-carbohydrate diet may promising avenue future adjuvant therapeutic strategies.
