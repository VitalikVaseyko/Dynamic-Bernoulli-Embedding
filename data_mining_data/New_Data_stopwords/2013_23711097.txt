 ability modulate production wild-type transcript cells bearing splice-altering familial dysautonomia (FD) causing mutation IKBKAP gene prompted study impact panel pharmaceuticals splicing transcript, revealed ability cardiac glycoside digoxin increase production wild-type, exon-20-containing, IKBKAP-encoded transcript full-length IkappaB-kinase-complex-associated protein FD-derived cells. Characterization cis elements trans factors involved digoxin-mediated effect splicing reveals response dependent SRSF3 binding site(s) located intron 5' alternatively spliced exon digoxin mediates effect suppressing level SRSF3 protein. Characterization digoxin-mediated effect RNA splicing process facilitated identification several RNA splicing events digoxin treatment mediates enhanced inclusion exonic sequence. Moreover, demonstrate ability digoxin impact splicing process neuronal cells, cell type profoundly impacted FD. study represents first demonstration digoxin possesses splice-altering capabilities capable reversing impact FD-causing mutation. findings support clinical evaluation impact digoxin FD patient population.
