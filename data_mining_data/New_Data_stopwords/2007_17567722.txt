 aimed support vitro glucosensing capacity observed vivo rainbow trout hypothalamus, hindbrain, Brockmann bodies (BB) obtain preliminary evidence mechanisms involved. response parameters involved glucosensing capacity [hexokinase, hexokinase IV (glucokinase), pyruvate kinase activities glucose glycogen levels] assessed tissues incubated 1 h 2, 4, 8 mM D-glucose alone (control) specific agonists/inhibitors steps involved glucosensing capacity mammals. agents competitor glucose phosphorylation (15 mM mannose), sulfonylurea receptor-1 effectors (500 microM tolbutamide diazoxide), glycolytic intermediates (15 mM glycerol, lactate, pyruvate), inhibitors glucose transport (10 microM cytochalasin B), glycolysis [20 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG)], L-type calcium channel (1 microM nifedipine). Control incubations three tissues displayed increased glucose glycogen levels glucokinase activities response increased medium glucose, thus supporting previous vivo studies. Furthermore, critical components glucosensing mammalian machinery apparently functioning three tissues. responses brain regions substances tested (except 2-DG nifedipine) similar observed mammals, suggesting similar glucosensing machinery. contrast, BB, effects 2-DG, lactate, pyruvate, diazoxide, nifedipine similar mammalian beta-cells, suggesting components piscine glucosensing model different mammals. differences may relate importance amino acids rather glucose signaling trout BB.
