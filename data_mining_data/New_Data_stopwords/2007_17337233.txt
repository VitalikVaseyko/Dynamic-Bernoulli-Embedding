 Protein kinase C (PKC) family members implicated numerous cellular processes. However, identifying substrates PKC isozyme remains challenge. Here, describe method using two-dimensional (2D) isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis identify substrates delta PKC (deltaPKC) MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. show M2 pyruvate kinase substrate deltaPKC, characterize interaction M2 pyruvate kinase deltaPKC MCF-7 cells immunoprecipitation. deltaPKC activation vitro cells appear alter enzyme activity polymerization M2 pyruvate kinase.
