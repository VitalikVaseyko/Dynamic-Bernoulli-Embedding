 early landmark discoveries cancer metabolism research uncovered metabolic processes support rapid proliferation, aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), glutaminolysis, increased nucleotide biosynthesis. However, limitations effectiveness specifically targeting metabolic processes support rapid proliferation. First, normal proliferative tissues also share similar metabolic features, may also affected treatments. Secondly, targeting proliferative metabolism may target highly proliferating "bulk tumor" cells slower-growing, clinically relevant cancer stem cell subpopulations may required effective cure. emerging body research indicates altered metabolism plays key roles supporting proliferation-independent functions cancer cell survival within ischemic acidic tumor microenvironment, immune system evasion, maintenance cancer stem cell state. aspects cancer cell metabolism critical tumor maintenance yet less likely relevant normal cells, represent attractive targets cancer therapy.
