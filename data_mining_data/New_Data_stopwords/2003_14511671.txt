 Fyn Src kinase known essential role mast cell degranulation induced following aggregation high affinity IgE-receptor. Although Fyn possesses SH2 SH3 protein binding domains, molecules interact Fyn characterized mast cells. thus analyzed Fyn-binding proteins MC/9 mast cells explore Fyn-mediated signaling pathway. mass spectrometric analysis proteins binding SH2 SH3 domains Fyn, identified six proteins bind Fyn including vimentin, pyruvate kinase, p62 ras-GAP associated phosphoprotein, SLP-76, HS-1, FYB. Among proteins, vimentin pyruvate kinase shown bind Fyn. IgE-receptor mediated stimulation, binding vimentin Fyn increased; interaction via binding SH2, SH3, domain Fyn. Mast cells vimentin-deficient mice showed enhanced mediator release tyrosine phosphorylation intracellular proteins including NTAL LAT. observation vimentin pyruvate kinase bind Fyn provides additional insight Fyn-mediated signaling pathways, suggests critical role Fyn mast cell degranulation interacting cytosolic structural proteins.
