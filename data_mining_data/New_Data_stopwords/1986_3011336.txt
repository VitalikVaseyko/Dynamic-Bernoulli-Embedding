 Morphology, urinary enzyme excretion mitochondrial function studied rats fed period 30 days 20 40 mg CsA/kg body weight. Already day 8 vacuolisation augmentation autophagic vacuoles, lipid droplets loss microvilli observed S-3 segment proximal nephron using lower CsA dose. effects enhanced treatment period. overall effect, however, subtle one. dose 40 mg/kg produces pronounced cellular alterations, severe vacuolisation, also focal prenecrotic damage proximal tubular S-2 S-3 cells. cells altered manner amount roughly 5% total proximal tubular epithelium. Enhanced urinary excretion proximal cytosolic enzymes, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glutathione S-transferase, pyruvate kinase lysosomal N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase appear parallel morphologic changes, whereby excretion pyruvate kinase significantly elevated day 30 using 40 mg/kg. Decrease oxidative phosphorilation capacity (ADP:O ratio) found CsA doses, however, result seems dissociated changes morphology enzyme excretion. Studies isolated tubular fragments vitro, exposed CsA exhibited inhibition cytosolic malate dehydrogenase isoenzyme, could interpreted possible source CsA induced tubular alteration.
