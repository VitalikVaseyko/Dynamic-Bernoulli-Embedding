 Nearly virulence factors Bordetella pertussis activated master two-component system, BvgAS, composed sensor kinase BvgS response regulator BvgA. BvgS active, BvgA phosphorylated (BvgA~P), virulence-activated genes (vags) expressed [Bvg(+) mode]. BvgS inactive BvgA phosphorylated, virulence-repressed genes (vrgs) induced [Bvg(-) mode]. Here, used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) define BvgAS-dependent regulon B. pertussis Tohama I. analyses reveal 550 BvgA-regulated genes, 353 newly identified. BvgA-activated genes include encoding two-component systems (such kdpED), multiple transcriptional regulators, extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor brpL, needed type 3 secretion system (T3SS) expression, establishing importance BvgA~P apex regulator transcriptional networks promoting virulence. Using vitro transcription, demonstrate promoter brpL directly activated BvgA~P. BvgA-FeBABE cleavage reactions identify BvgA~P binding sites centered positions -41.5 -63.5 bprL importantly, show first time genes multiple varied metabolic pathways significantly upregulated B. pertussis Bvg(-) mode. include genes fatty acid lipid metabolism, sugar amino acid transporters, pyruvate dehydrogenase, phenylacetic acid degradation, glycolate/glyoxylate utilization pathway. results suggest metabolic changes Bvg(-) mode may participating bacterial survival, transmission, and/or persistence identify 200 new vrgs tested function.IMPORTANCE Within past 20 years, outbreaks whooping cough, caused Bordetella pertussis, led respiratory disease infant mortalities, despite good vaccination coverage. due, least part, introduction less effective acellular vaccine 1990s. crucial, then, understand molecular basis B. pertussis growth infection. two-component system BvgA (response regulator)/BvgS (histidine kinase) master regulator B. pertussis virulence genes. report first RNA-seq analysis BvgAS regulon B. pertussis, revealing 550 genes regulated BvgAS. show genes multiple varied metabolic pathways highly regulated Bvg(-) mode (absence BvgA phosphorylation). results suggest metabolic changes Bvg(-) mode may participating bacterial survival, transmission, and/or persistence.
