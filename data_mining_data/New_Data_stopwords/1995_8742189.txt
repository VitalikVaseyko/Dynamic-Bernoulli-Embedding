 Mouse renal cell tumors (RCT) induced male CBA male mice 5 subcutaneous injections 8 mg 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) per kg body weight week. lag period two years kidneys removed, serial cryostat sections kidneys histochemically analyzed following parameters: Glycogen content, basophilia, activities glycogen synthase (SYN), glycogen phosphorylase (PHO), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malic enzyme (ME), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT). RCT displayed histochemical profile irrespective size growth pattern. comparison normal kidney epithelium, neoplastic cells exhibited elevated activities enzymes glycolysis (HK, PK LDH) pentose phosphate pathway (G6PDH) negative G6Pase low SDH activity observed cells. majority RCT showed high PHO activity weak staining SYN. Activities ALPase GGT negative RCT. Giant cells detected large RCT. Higher activities glycolytic mitochondrial enzymes G6PDH found giant cells compared tumor cells. Tubular preneoplastic lesions similar neoplastic lesions morphological histochemical characteristics. present study revealed markedly elevated capacity glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway occurred renal cell tumors mice. similar histochemical pattern preneoplastic tubular lesions observed suggests metabolic aberrations emerge early carcinogenesis, studies earlier stages renal carcinogenesis needed substantiate assumption.
