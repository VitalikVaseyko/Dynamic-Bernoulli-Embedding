 Microbial stimuli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce robust metabolic rewiring immune cells known Warburg effect. unknown whether increase glycolysis decrease oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) general characteristic monocytes encountered pathogen. Using CD14(+) monocytes healthy donors, demonstrated microbial stimuli increased glycolysis, stimulation Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 LPS led decrease OXPHOS. Instead, activation TLRs, TLR2 activation Pam3CysSK4 (P3C), increased oxygen consumption mitochondrial enzyme activity. Transcriptome metabolome analysis monocytes stimulated P3C versus LPS confirmed divergent metabolic responses stimuli, revealed significant differences tricarboxylic acid cycle, OXPHOS lipid metabolism pathways following stimulation monocytes P3C versus LPS. functional level, pharmacological inhibition complex mitochondrial electron transport chain diminished cytokine production phagocytosis P3C- LPS-stimulated monocytes. Thus, unlike LPS, complex microbial stimuli TLR2 ligand P3C induce specific pattern metabolic rewiring involves upregulation glycolysis OXPHOS, enables activation host defence mechanisms cytokine production phagocytosis.
