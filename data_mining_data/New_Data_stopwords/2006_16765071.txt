 previously reported formation 6-nitrotryptophan reaction reactive nitrogen species tryptophan residue human Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) (F. Yamakura et al., J. Biochem. 138 (2005) 57-69). Here, report preparation anti-6-nitrotryptophan antiserum using synthesized 6-nitrotryptophan-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin antigen purification antibody using 6-nitrotryptophan-conjugated affinity column. purified antibody immunoreactive 6-nitrotryptophan residue containing Cu, Zn-SOD immunoreactive Cu, Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, bovine serum albumin, 3-nitrotyrosine residue containing Mn-SOD. Nitro group 6-nitrotryptophan reduced sodium hydrosulfite form 6-aminotryptophan major product. reduced 6-nitrotryptophan residues lost immunoreactivity antibody. detected different immunoreactive bands using antibody 6-nitrotryptophan residues 3-nitrotyrosine residues crude extracts neuron-like PC12 cells treated peroxynitrite Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed nine intensively stained immunoreactive spots 6-nitrotryptophan residues peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells, subjected trypsin digestion LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. identified M2 pyruvate kinase, elongation factor 2, mitochondrial aconitase, pyruvate carboxylase, heat shock protein HSP90alpha candidates 6-nitrotryptophan residues containing proteins, peptide coverage 10%, crude extracts peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells.
