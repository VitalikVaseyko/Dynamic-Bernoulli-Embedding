 Metabolic imaging brain tumors using (13)C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate promising neuroimaging strategy which, decade preclinical success glioblastoma (GBM) models, entering clinical trials multiple centers. Typically, presence GBM associated elevated hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate produced [1-(13)C] pyruvate, response therapy associated drop hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate. However, date, lower grade gliomas investigated using approach. prevalent mutation lower grade gliomas isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, which, addition initiating tumor development, also induces metabolic reprogramming. particular, mutant IDH1 gliomas associated low levels lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) monocarboxylate transporters 1 4 (MCT1, MCT4), three proteins involved pyruvate metabolism lactate. therefore investigated potential (13)C MRS hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] pyruvate detection mutant IDH1 gliomas monitoring therapeutic response. studied patient-derived mutant IDH1 glioma cells underexpress LDHA, MCT1 MCT4, wild-type IDH1 GBM cells express high levels proteins. Mutant IDH1 cells tumors produced significantly less hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate compared GBM, consistent metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, hyperpolarized [1-(13)C] lactate production affected chemotherapeutic treatment temozolomide (TMZ) mutant IDH1 tumors, contrast previous reports GBM. results demonstrate unusual metabolic imaging profile mutant IDH1 gliomas, which, combined clinically available imaging methods, could used detect presence IDH1 mutation vivo.
