 myopathic disorders, abnormal serum enzyme activities seen primarily diseases skeletal muscle condition involves muscle fibers themselves. denervation myopathies, serum enzyme activities usually normal. dramatic increases serum enzymes, particularly creatine kinase, found dystrophic diseases, particularly Duchenne dystrophy. review given many causes abnormal serum enzyme activities source enzymes believed skeletal muscle. include dystrophies, various types trauma, exercise, drug- poison-induced causes including alcohol, malignant hyperthermia, inflammatory diseases, miscellaneous causes. Tissue serum activities summarized commonly performed serum enzymes, i.e., CK, LD, AST, aldolase. extensive tabular current description various types dystrophies given along serum CK pyruvate kinase activities.
