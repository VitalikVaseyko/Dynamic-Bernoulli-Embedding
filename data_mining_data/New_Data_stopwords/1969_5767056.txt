 1. pyruvate kinases desert locust fat body flight muscle partially purified ammonium sulphate fractionation. 2. fat-body enzyme allosterically activated low (1mum) concentrations fructose 1,6-diphosphate, whereas flight-muscle enzyme unaffected metabolite physiological pH. 3. Flight-muscle pyruvate kinase activated preincubation 25 degrees 5min., whereas fat-body enzyme unaffected treatment. 4. enzymes require 1-2mm-ADP maximal activity inhibited higher concentrations. fat-body enzyme inhibition ADP prevented presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate. 5. enzymes inhibited ATP, half-maximal inhibition occurring 5mm-ATP. fat-body enzyme ATP inhibition reversed fructose 1,6-diphosphate. 6. fat-body enzyme exhibits maximal activity pH7.2 activity decreases rapidly pH. inactivation high pH observed presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate, i.e. maximum stimulating effects fructose 1,6-diphosphate observed high pH. flight-muscle enzyme exhibits two optima, one pH7.2 fat-body enzyme pH8.5. Stimulation enzyme activity fructose 1,6-diphosphate observed pH8.5 above.
