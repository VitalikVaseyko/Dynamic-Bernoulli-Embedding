 Possible enhancement myocardial protection adding DBcAMP oxygenation crystalloid cardioplegic solution (CCS) evaluated three group study. patients coronary bypass operation valvular operation divided three groups, consisting 15 patients, differing type CCS employed. Group protected nonoxygenated CCS (PO2 190 mmHg, PCO2, 32 mmHg, pH 7.78, K 30 mmEq/L), Group II adding DBcAMP nonoxygenated CCS Group III adding DBcAMP oxygenated CCS (PO2 790 mmHg, PCO2 26 mmHg, pH 7.87). Group III significantly improved CI double product (p less 0.05) compared Group II. However, CPK, CPK-MB, myoglobin serum similar group. Lactate pyruvate ratio (L/P) coronary sinus bloods improved lower value pump pump Group III. Base excess coronary sinus held alkalosis aortic declamp Group III. refunction time significantly shortest Group III groups (p less 0.01, 0.05) Group II significantly shorter Group (p less 0.05). concluded oxygenation adding DBcAMP CCS effectual myocardial metabolism protect myocardial damage cardiac arrest.
