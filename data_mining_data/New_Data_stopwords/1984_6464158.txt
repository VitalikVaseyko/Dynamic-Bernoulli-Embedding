 Red cells fractionated age blood processor (Model 2991, IBM). However, little data exist processing product transfusion. report details method collecting young erythrocyte (YE) units containing mean hemoglobin content 56.43 +/- 1.39 (SEM) grams. Enrichment YEs indicated greater activity enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) aliquots YE units. mean ratio PK activity young red cell product compared unfractionated blood 1.14 +/- 0.03 (SEM). increased PK ratio noted 23 26 units studied. Based PK ratio, mean age erythrocytes 46 days, compared 60 days standard units blood. 6 units assayed, reticulocyte count increased. Collection YE units relatively easy, untoward donor reactions observed, deleterious effects developed recipient. Although data suggest enrichment young population red cells, YE units produced method experimental. Routine use procedure awaits demonstration significant decrease transfusion frequency patients receiving YE units chronic red cell therapy.
