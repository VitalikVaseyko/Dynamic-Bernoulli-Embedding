 study, examined modulatory effect hinokitiol (HK) production tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, critical factor involved skin inflammation hair follicle apoptosis. HK effectively suppressed TNF-alpha production lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated, macrophage-like (RAW264.7) cells. compound also diminished mRNA synthesis TNF-alpha, indicating HK-mediated inhibition may occur transcriptional level. Moreover, compound down-regulated phosphorylation PDK1, Akt/PKB, ERK, resulting loss nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation, detectable immunoblotting reporter gene assays. Therefore, results suggest HK may cure hair loss suppressing factors promote follicular apoptosis, TNF-alpha, addition stimulating new hair growth.
