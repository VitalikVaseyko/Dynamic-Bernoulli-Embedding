 Three measures locomotory performance series variables thought affect performance measured iguanid lizard Ctenosaura similis. Burst speed mass independent; however, endurance time 1 km/h (EN-DUR) maximal distance run (MAX DIS) scale M0.3. Standard maximal rates O2 consumption (VO2max) scale M0.9; VO2max averages 10-fold greater standard metabolic rate (SMR). Three ten enzyme activities measured exhibit significant scaling. statistically removing effects body mass, multiple-regression analysis indicates 1) 89% residual variation ENDUR correlated variation among individuals thigh muscle mass, VO2max, heart mass, liver citrate synthase (CS) activity; 2) maximal CO2 consumption (VCO2max) thigh pyruvate kinase activity statistically explain 64% variation MAX DIS; 3) heart liver masses together predict 35% variation SMR; 4) thigh liver CS activity, heart lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, hematocrit account 67% variation VO2max;5) 97% variation VCO2max statistically related variation liver CS activity, thigh heart masses, heart LDH activity.
