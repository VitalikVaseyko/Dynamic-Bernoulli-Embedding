 PPARbeta/delta activation protects endothelial dysfunction diabetic models. Elevated glucose known impair cAMP-induced relaxation Kv channel function coronary arteries (CA). Herein, aimed analyse possible protective effects PPARbeta/delta agonist GW0742 hyperglycaemic-induced impairment cAMP-induced relaxation Kv channel function rat CA. compared low glucose (LG), incubation high glucose (HG) conditions attenuated relaxation induced adenylate cyclase activator forskolin CA prevented GW0742. protective effect GW0742 supressed PPARbeta/delta antagonist. myocytes isolated CA LG, forskolin enhanced Kv currents induced hyperpolarization. contrast, CA incubated HG, Kv currents diminished electrophysiological effects forskolin abolished. deleterious effects prevented GW0742. protective effects GW0742 forskolin-induced relaxation Kv channel function confirmed CA type-1 diabetic rats. addition, differences relaxation induced forskolin CA incubated LG, HG HG + GW0742 abolished Kv7 channel inhibitor XE991. Accordingly, GW0742 prevented down-regulation Kv7 channels induced HG. Finally, preventive effect GW0742 oxidative stress cAMP-induced relaxation overcome pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA). results reveal PPARbeta/delta agonist GW0742 prevents impairment cAMP-mediated relaxation CA HG. protective effect associated induction PDK4, attenuation oxidative stress preservation Kv7 channel function.
