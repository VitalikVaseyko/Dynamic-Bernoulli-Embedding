 Heat-shocked Xenopus embryos unusually complex heat shock response. dominant heat shock protein (Hsp) relative molecular mass (M(r)) 62,000 (Hsp62). Affinity-purified IgGs glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) specifically immunoprecipitated Hsp62 extracts embryos heat-shocked 37 degrees C 30 min. Thus, Hsp62 pyruvate kinase immunologically cross-reacting. Electrophoretic separation PK isoforms suggests heat-shocked Xenopus embryos increase synthesis isoform PK. Thermal denaturation studies suggest isoform enhanced thermal stability. identification PK Hsp discussed within context physiological requirement elevated levels anaerobic glycolysis heat-stressed cells vital component acquisition thermotolerance.
