 effects phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), master kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, platelet activation unknown. Accordingly, platelet-specific PDK1-deficient mice characterized elucidate platelet-related function(s) PDK1. found PDK1 deficiency caused mild thrombocytopenia. aggregation PDK1(-/-) platelets diminished response low levels thrombin, U46619, adenosine 5'-diphosphate. results demonstrated PDK1 regulates thrombin-induced platelet activation affecting alphaIIbbeta3-mediated outside-in signaling. result provided explanation diminished spreading PDK1(-/-) platelets immobilized fibrinogen (Fg) decreased rate clot retraction platelet-rich plasma (PRP) containing PDK1(-/-) platelets. PDK1 deficiency diminished agonist-induced Akt Ser473 phosphorylation thoroughly abolished Akt Thr308 Gsk3beta Ser9 phosphorylation response agonist treatment platelet spreading, respectively. Gsk3beta inhibitor fully restored aggregation PDK1(-/-) platelets response low levels thrombin, normal spreading PDK1(-/-) platelets Fg, normal clot retraction PRP containing PDK1(-/-) platelets. results indicated Gsk3beta one major downstream effectors PDK1 thrombin-induced platelet activation alphaIIbbeta3-mediated outside-in signaling. addition, vivo data demonstrated PDK1 important regulator arterial thrombosis formation.
