 Clones encoding two different forms plastid pyruvate kinase (PKp; EC 2.7.1.40) isolated castor tobacco seed cDNA libraries. One form, designated PKpA, castor described previous report, tobacco homologue PKpA isolated. addition, second cDNA, designated PKpG, identified sequenced species. Western blot analysis, using antibodies raised protein overexpressed clones, indicates encode two predominant polypeptides plastid pyruvate kinase developing castor endosperm. castor, PKpA PKpG encoded single genes. allotetraploid Nicotiana tabacum, two copies each, one derived progenitors species. expression genes PKpA PKpG examined various tissues castor tobacco. castor, forms expressed developing germinating endosperm root neither expressed leaf. tobacco, forms expressed developing seeds mature tissues, PKpA abundant roots PKpG leaves.
