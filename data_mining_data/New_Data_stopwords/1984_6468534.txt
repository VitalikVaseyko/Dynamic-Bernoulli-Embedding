 diploid epithelial cell line (termed WB-F344) isolated liver adult male Fischer-344 rat phenotypic characteristics cells studied. cells measure approximately two-fifths volume freshly isolated hepatocytes. histochemically negative glucose-6-phosphatase weakly positive gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. produce extensive intercellular reticulin fibers stain immunocytochemically fibronectin, synthesize alpha-fetoprotein albumin, accumulate glycogen particles. Ultrastructurally, polygonal cells numerous intercellular desmosomes nexus junctions, partially surrounded basement membrane-like material. Cytoplasmic organelles include few, sometimes dilated profiles rough endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, abundant free ribosomes, sparse smooth endoplasmic reticulum Golgi membranes, microbodies, small, pleomorphic mitochondria. express C isozymes aldolase, K isozyme pyruvate kinase, LDH2 LDH5 isozymes lactate dehydrogenase, 'fetal liver'-type alkaline phosphatase isozyme. compared phenotypes isolated purified normal hepatocytes, biliary epithelial (ductular) cells 'oval' cells isolated livers treated chemical carcinogens, phenotypic properties liver epithelial cell line culture resemble 'oval' cells.
