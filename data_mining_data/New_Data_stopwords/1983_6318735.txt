 activity pyruvate dehydrogenase extracts pig mesenteric lymphocytes measured different preincubation conditions. mitogens concanavalin ionophore A23187 increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. cases activation required extracellular Ca2+. Digitonin-permeabilized cells required 0.5 microM free Ca2+ half-maximal activation pyruvate dehydrogenase. stimulation concanavalin intact cells probably due changes effectors pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. evidence suggests activation pyruvate dehydrogenase Ca2+ activation pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase supports view cytoplasmic free [Ca2+] rises something less 1 microM stimulation mitogens.
