 Protection cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) hypoxia injury important therapeutic strategy treating ischaemic cardiovascular disease. study, investigated effects qiliqiangxin (QL) primary rat CMECs exposed hypoxia underlying mechanisms. Rat CMECs successfully isolated passaged second generation. CMECs pre-treated QL (0.5 mg/mL) and/or HIF-1alpha siRNA cultured three-gas hypoxic incubator chamber (5% CO2 , 1% O2 , 94% N2 ) 12 hours. Firstly, demonstrated compared hypoxia group, QL effectively promoted proliferation attenuated apoptosis, improved mitochondrial function reduced ROS generation hypoxic CMECs HIF-1alpha-dependent manner. Meanwhile, QL also promoted angiogenesis CMECs via HIF-1alpha/VEGF signalling pathway. Moreover, QL improved glucose utilization metabolism increased ATP production up-regulating HIF-1alpha series glycolysis-relevant enzymes, including glucose transport 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 2 (HK2), 6-phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA). findings indicate QL protect CMECs hypoxia injury via promoting glycolysis HIF-1alpha-dependent manner. Lastly, results suggested QL-dependent enhancement HIF-1alpha protein expression hypoxic CMECs associated regulation AMPK/mTOR/HIF-1alpha pathway, speculated QL also improved HIF-1alpha stabilization down-regulating prolyl hydroxylases 3 (PHD3) expression.
