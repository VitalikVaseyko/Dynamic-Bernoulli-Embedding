 Malignant tumors, colorectal cancer (CRC), heterogeneous diseases characterized distinct metabolic phenotypes. include Warburg- reverse Warburg phenotypes depending differential distribution lactate carrier proteins monocarboxylate transporter-4 -1 (MCT4 MCT1). Here, elucidated role antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) key regulator cellular adaptation inflammatory/environmental stress shaping metabolism toward reverse Warburg phenotype malignant premalignant colonic epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry human CRC tissues revealed reciprocal expression MCT1 MCT4 carcinoma stroma cells, respectively, accompanied strong epithelial Nrf2 activation. colorectal tissue inflammatory bowel disease patients, MCT1 Nrf2 coexpressed well, relating CD68+inflammatory infiltrates. Indirect coculture human NCM460 colonocytes M1- M2 macrophages induces MCT1 well G6PD, LDHB TALDO expression, whereas MCT4 expression decreased. Nrf2 knockdown reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging blocked coculture effects NCM460 cells. Likewise, Nrf2 knockdown inhibited similar effects tBHQ-mediated Nrf2 activation NCM460 HCT15 CRC cells. M1 coculture Nrf2 activation/overexpression greatly altered lactate uptake glucose uptake mitochondrial activities cells, reflecting reverse Warburg phenotype. Depending MCT1-mediated lactate uptake, Nrf2 conferred protection TRAIL-induced apoptosis NCM460 HCT15 cells. Moreover, metabolism-dependent clonal growth HCT15 cells induced Nrf2-dependent activation MCT1-driven lactate exchange. findings indicate Nrf2 impact metabolism already premalignant colonic epithelial cells exposed inflammatory M1 macrophages, effect accompanied growth survival alterations. Favoring reverse Warburg effect, Nrf2-dependent alterations add malignant transformation colonic epithelium.
