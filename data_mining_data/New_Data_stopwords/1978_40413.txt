 picture, emerging experimental results physical association multienzyme systems, true physiological significance aggregated state understood correlated structural functional integration cellular metabolic framework whole. enzyme clusters exhibit two distinct functional properties. first spatial translocation intermediate substrates, effect may viewed metabolic "channelling" "vectorial catalysis" enzyme clusters arrayed manner cell. second coordinate regulation represents efficient economical mean controlling two functionally related enzymes. common element two properties spatial character, potentially present function regulation intermediary metabolism. biological systems, metabolism particular, exhibit stability variability; latter sometimes assumes character periodicity. Whether oscillations definite importance level intermediary metabolism itself, may well questioned; oscillatory faculties may rather serve elements used complex functions biological systems. thorough understanding role clustered multienzyme systems oscillatory phenomena cellular metabolism demands clearer physicochemical picture dynamic state living cell present. reason generalizations derived vitro studies single, isolated enzyme activities justified.
