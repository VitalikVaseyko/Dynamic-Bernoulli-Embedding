 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells simultaneously exhibit glycolysis lactate secretion mitochondrial respiration even presence oxygen, phenomenon known Warburg effect. maintenance mixed metabolic phenotype seemingly counterintuitive given aerobic glycolysis far less efficient terms ATP yield per moles glucose mitochondrial respiration. RESULTS: Here, resolve apparent contradiction expanding notion metabolic efficiency. study reduced flux balance model ATP production constrained glucose uptake capacity solvent capacity cell's cytoplasm, latter quantifying maximum amount macromolecules occupy intracellular space. low glucose uptake rates find mitochondrial respiration indeed efficient pathway ATP generation. threshold glucose uptake rate, however, gradual activation aerobic glycolysis slight decrease mitochondrial respiration results highest rate ATP production. CONCLUSIONS: analyses indicate Warburg effect favorable catabolic state rapidly proliferating mammalian cells high glucose uptake capacity. arises aerobic glycolysis less efficient mitochondrial respiration terms ATP yield per glucose uptake, efficient terms required solvent capacity. results may direct relevance chemotherapeutic strategies attempting target cancer metabolism.
