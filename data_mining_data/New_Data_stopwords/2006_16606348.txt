 PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) strongly inhibited phosphorylation starvation conserve substrates gluconeogenesis. role PDHK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4) regulation PDC mechanism investigated PDHK4-/- mice (homozygous PDHK4 knockout mice). Starvation lowers blood glucose mice lacking PDHK4 wild-type mice. activity state PDC (percentage dephosphorylated active) greater kidney, gastrocnemius muscle, diaphragm heart liver starved PDHK4-/- mice. Intermediates gluconeogenic pathway lower concentration liver starved PDHK4-/- mice, consistent lower rate gluconeogenesis due substrate supply limitation. concentration gluconeogenic substrates lower blood starved PDHK4-/- mice, consistent reduced formation peripheral tissues. Isolated diaphragms starved PDHK4-/- mice accumulate less lactate pyruvate faster rate pyruvate oxidation reduced rate glycolysis. BCAAs (branched chain amino acids) higher blood starved PDHK4-/- mice, consistent lower blood alanine levels importance BCAAs source amino groups alanine formation. Non-esterified fatty acids also elevated blood starved PDHK4-/- mice, consistent lower rates fatty acid oxidation due increased rates glucose pyruvate oxidation due greater PDC activity. Up-regulation PDHK4 tissues liver clearly important starvation regulation PDC activity glucose homoeostasis.
