 Using immunofluorescent antibody techniques, conversion pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes maturation erythroblasts studied. normal subjects, M2-type PK clearly seen proerythroblast stage, markedly declined cell maturation, whereas L-type PK continued increase. classical type PK deficiency, M2-type PK still clearly seen orthochromatic erythroblasts, whereas L-type PK scarcely detected maturation. PK deficiency cases, change L-type PK showed similar pattern normal M2-type PK still clearly seen later stage maturation classical type. K-562 human leukemia cell line, M2-type PK declined L-type PK increased parallel hemoglobin synthesis addition hemin, inducer differentiation erythroblasts. Hemoglobin synthesis L-type PK production appear interrelation differentiation maturation erythroblasts.
