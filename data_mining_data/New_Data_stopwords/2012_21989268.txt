 identify proteins involved 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance, comparison total phosphorylated proteins human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line DLD-1 5-FU-resistant subclone DLD-1/5-FU performed. Using 2-DE MALDI-TOF/TOF-based proteomics, 17 up-regulated 19 down-regulated protein spots identified 5-FU-resistant DLD-1/5-FU cells compared parent cell lines. DLD-1/5-FU cells, 7 anti-apoptotic proteins (HSPB1, proteasome subunit alpha-5, transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, 14-3-3 beta, 14-3-3 gamma, 14-3-3 sigma, phosphoglycerate kinase 1) up-regulated 4 proapoptotic proteins (cofilin-1, pyruvate kinase M2, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, nucleophosmin) down-regulated. results show acquired drug resistance DLD-1/5-FU cells caused prevention drug-induced apoptosis, particular enhanced constitutive expression HSPB1 phosphorylated form. Short interfering RNA knockdown endogenous HSPB1 DLD-1/5-FU cells restored sensitivity 5-FU. Furthermore, MALDI-TOF/TOF 2-DE Western blot analysis identified phosphorylated residues HSPB1 Ser-15 Ser-82 main (diphosphorylated) form Ser-15, Ser-78, Ser-82 minor (triphosphorylated) form. current findings indicate phosphorylated HSPB1 may play important role 5-FU resistance.
