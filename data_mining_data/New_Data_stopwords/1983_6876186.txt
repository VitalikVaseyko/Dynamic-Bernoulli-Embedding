 effects increased cardiac work, pyruvate insulin state pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activation rate pyruvate decarboxylation studied isolated perfused rat heart. low levels cardiac work, 61% PDH present active form glucose substrate provided. actual rate pyruvate decarboxylation 5% available capacity calculated percent active PDH. condition, rate pyruvate decarboxylation restricted slow rate pyruvate production glycolysis. Increasing cardiac work accelerated glycolysis, production pyruvate remained rate limiting pyruvate oxidation 40% maximal active PDH capacity used. Addition insulin along glucose reduced percent active PDH 16% total low cardiac work. effect insulin associated increased mitochondria NADH/NAD acetyl CoA/CoA ratios. glucose insulin calculated maximum capacity active PDH measured rates pyruvate oxidation indicating pyruvate oxidation limited activation state PDH. case, raising level cardiac work increased active PDH 85% although pyruvate oxidation accelerated, measured flux PDH 73% maximal activity active PDH. pyruvate added exogenous substrate, PDH 82% active low cardiac work probably due pyruvate inhibition PDH kinase. case, measured rate pyruvate oxidation 64% capacity active PDH. However, increased cardiac work still caused activation PDH 96% active. Thus, actual rates pyruvate oxidation intact tissue determined (1) supply pyruvate hearts receiving glucose alone, (2) percent active PDH hearts receiving glucose insulin low work (3) end-product inhibition hearts receiving glucose insulin high work levels work pyruvate substrate. increase active PDH higher levels cardia work associated closely reduced mitochondrial NADH/NAD ratios decreased acetyl CoA/CoA ratios insulin pyruvate present.
