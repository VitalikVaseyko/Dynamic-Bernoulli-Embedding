 OBJECTIVES: Three luting cements based zinc oxide phosphate, glass ionomer composite resin compared respect influence anaerobic fermentation sucrose human oral bacteria. METHODS: Fifteen standardized samples three luting cements prepared according manufacturer's instructions stored 72 h 37 degrees C distilled water, also used elution medium. removing samples solutions incubated human fasting saliva, sucrose bicarbonate buffer Warburg apparatus. Intermediary organic acids resulting anaerobic fermentation sucrose quantified indirectly manometric measurement CO2, released buffer. RESULTS: materials indicate either accelerating inhibiting effect formation organic acids sucrose. CONCLUSION: case bacterial microleakage along interface cavity luting cement, inhibition acid induced dentin enamel demineralisation--using materials investigated--cannot expected.
