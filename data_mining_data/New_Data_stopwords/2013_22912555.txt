 AIM: investigate M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) expression gastric cancers evaluate potential prognostic biomarker anticancer target. METHODS: tissue samples derived gastric cancer patients underwent curative gastrectomy primary treatment. Clinical pathological information obtained medical records. Gene expression microarray data 60 cancer 19 non-cancer gastric tissues analyzed evaluate expression level PKM2 mRNA. Tissue microarrays constructed 368 gastric cancer patients. Immunohistochemistry used measure PKM2 expression PKM2 positivity cancer determined proportion PKM2-positive tumor cells staining intensity. Association PKM2 expression clinicopathological factors evaluated correlation PKM2 cancer prognosis evaluated. RESULTS: PKM2 mRNA levels increased 2-fold primary gastric cancers compared adjacent normal tissues patients (log transformed expression level: 7.6 +/- 0.65 vs 6.3 +/- 0.51, P < 0.001). Moreover, differentiated type cancers significantly higher PKM2 mRNA compared undifferentiated type cancers (log transformed expression level: 7.8 +/- 0.70 vs 6.7 +/- 0.71, P < 0.001). PKM2 protein mainly localized cytoplasm primary cancer cells detected 144 368 (39.1%) human gastric cancer cases. PKM2 expression related stage (P = 0.811), strongly correlated gastric cancer differentiation (P < 0.001). Differentiated type cancers expressed PKM2 protein undifferentiated ones. Well differentiated adenocarcinoma showed 63.6% PKM2-positive cells; contrast, signet-ring cell cancers showed 17.7% PKM2-positive cells. Importantly, PKM2 expression correlated shorter overall survival (P < 0.05) independent stage signet-ring cell cancers. CONCLUSION: PKM2 expression might adverse prognostic factor signet-ring cell carcinomas. function potential prognostic marker verified gastric cancer.
