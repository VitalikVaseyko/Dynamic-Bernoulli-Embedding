 Caspase-1 essential effector inflammation, pyroptosis, septic shock. caspase-1 substrates identified date, substrates account wide range actions. understand function caspase-1, initiated systematic identification cellular substrates. Using diagonal gel proteomic approach, identified 41 proteins directly cleaved caspase-1. Among chaperones, cytoskeletal translation machinery proteins, proteins involved immunity. series unexpected proteins along glycolysis pathway also identified, including aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, alpha-enolase, pyruvate kinase. exception latter, identified glycolysis enzymes specifically cleaved vitro recombinant caspase-1, caspase-3. enzymatic activity wild-type glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, non-cleavable mutant, dampened caspase-1 processing. vivo, stimuli fully activated caspase-1, including Salmonella typhimurium infection septic shock, caused pronounced processing proteins macrophage diaphragm muscle, respectively. Notably, stimuli inhibited glycolysis wild-type cells compared caspase-1-deficient cells. systematic characterization caspase-1 substrates identifies glycolysis pathway caspase-1 target provides new insights function pyroptosis septic shock.
