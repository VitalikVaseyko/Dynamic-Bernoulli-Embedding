 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase inactivated 2', 3'-dialdehyde ADP incorporation one molecule reagent per enzyme subunit. inactivated protein digested trypsin reduction carboxymethylation. labeled peptide isolated gel filtration purified HPLC. peptide sequenced liquid-phase gas-phase automatic Edman degradation. 34-residue peptide obtained. peptide identical tryptic peptide labeled trinitrobenzenesulfonate, isolated sequenced Johnson et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1979) 90, 525-530) bovine muscle pyruvate kinase. Available evidence suggests dialdehyde ADP labels enzyme lysine position 25 peptide, found Johnson et al. high homology isolated peptide regions pyruvate kinases low high eukaryotes supports idea peptide related enzyme active site.
