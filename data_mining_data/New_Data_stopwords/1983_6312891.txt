 Glucagon dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibited glucose utilization lowered fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels hepatocytes prepared fed chickens. Partially purified preparations chicken liver 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activated inhibited fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, respectively. sensitivities enzymes changes observed fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels consistent important role allosteric effector hormonal regulation carbohydrate metabolism chicken liver. contrast, oleate inhibition glucose utilization chicken hepatocytes occurred without change fructose, 2,6-bisphosphate levels. Likewise, pyruvate inhibition lactate gluconeogenesis chicken hepatocytes cannot explained changes fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. Exogenous glucose caused marked increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content hepatocytes fasted fed birds. glucagon lactate prevented glucose effect. Fasted chicken hepatocytes responded lower glucose concentrations fasted rat hepatocytes, perhaps reflecting species difference hexokinase isozymes.
