 Pyruvate kinase (PK) one regulatory enzymes glycolysis. present study undertaken determine whether regulation enzyme normally occurring metabolites disturbed leukocytes mothers delivered fetally malnourished (FM) babies. Kinetic studies enzyme regulation physiologic effectors approximated potential regulating mechanism enzyme cellular environment. two isoenzymes PK. Leukocytes contain M2 enzyme intermediate regulatory properties liver (type L) muscle (type M) enzymes. presence cell M2 PK form leads inhibition glycolysis amino acids, alanine, therefore, sparing glucose probably inhibition energy production glucose. study, leukocytes isolated blood six pregnant women 11 women postpartum period Oklahoma parturition 31 women Mexico. Fourteen latter group delivered FM babies. kinetic characteristics nonpurified enzyme PK respect allosteric modulation fructose-1, 6-phosphate (FDP) L-alanine (Ala) studied leukocyte extracts. Data initial reaction velocities (v) vs substrate concentrations (s), double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots, Hill plots presented. equations double reciprocal plots determined linear regression analysis. enzyme constants derived computer, values compared Mann-Whitney U-test. subjects studied, 0.5 mM FDP activated 2 mM L-alanine inhibited enzyme. pregnancy, v vs concentration curves hyperbolic (Hill coefficient, n less 1.0) except Ala-inhibited enzyme pregnancy, sigmoid curve, n=1.54. interaction FDP Ala dependent concentration substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) low [PEP]. net activation, inhibition, high concentrations; switchover 0.5 mM PEP pregnancy. Mexican mothers normal babies (normal mothers) maximum initial velocity, V (micromoles per min per mg DNA), respect PEP, 2.22+/-0.34; FM mothers, V 2.01+/-0.44. respect binding substrate, PEP, V leukocyte enzymes FM mothers vs normal mothers equally inhibited Ala (deltaV=-50% vs -47%), significantly less responsive stimulation FDP (deltaV=+10% vs +75%). Ala FDP present, FDP less effectively overcame inhibition Ala (deltaV=-9% vs +54%). K0.05 enzyme (molar concentration X 10(-4) PEP) significantly reduced FDP, whether Ala present not, pregnancy postpartum period leukocytes Oklahoma mothers term Mexican mothers. K0.5 normal FM mothers similar. Thus, enzyme leukocytes Mexican mothers delivered FM normal babies exhibited different kinetic responses allosteric modulators...
