 synthesized 2'-deoxy-2'-iodoadenosine-5'-triphosphate (2'-IATP), heavy-atom analog adenosine-5'-triphosphate. compound made X-ray structural studies target nucleotide site ATP binding proteins. diffused successfully crystals microtubule-based motor proteins ncd (non-claret disjunctional protein Drosophila melanogaster) kinesin. ncd, nucleotide binding site 70% occupied crystals able diffract X-rays 2.5 A. iodo-analog provided useful isomorphous derivative overall phasing power 1.89 range 25.0-2.5 A. kinesin, 2'-IATP co-crystallized protein. crystals diffracted least 2.8 phasing power 1.73 range 20.0-5.0 A. analog also found substrate enzymes tested, including creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, myosin, values Km Vmax within factor 10 ATP. analog supported muscle contraction, relaxing fibers, producing active tension values statistically different obtained ATP. results suggest analog useful providing heavy-atom derivative crystals enzymes bind ATP.
