 Several studies suggested maternal lifestyle pregnancy may influence long-term health offspring altering offspring epigenome. Whether maternal leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) pregnancy might effect unknown. purpose study determine relationship maternal LTPA pregnancy offspring DNA methylation. Participants recruited Archive Research Child Health study. enrollment, participants' demographic information self-reported LTPA pregnancy determined. High active participants (averaged 637.5 min per week LTPA; n=14) matched age race low active participants (averaged 59.5 min per week LTPA; n=28). Blood spots obtained birth. Pyrosequencing used determine methylation levels long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) (global methylation) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC1-alpha), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4) transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2). found differences offspring high active low active groups LINE-1 methylation. differences candidate gene methylation groups two CpG sites P2 promoter IGF2; offspring low active group significantly higher DNA methylation (74.70+/-2.25% methylation low active v. 72.83+/-2.85% methylation high active; P=0.045). results suggest effect maternal LTPA offspring global candidate gene methylation, exception IGF2. IGF2 previously associated regulation physical activity, suggesting possible role maternal LTPA regulation offspring physical activity.
