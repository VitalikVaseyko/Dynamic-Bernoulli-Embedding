 summarize results study properties two models transimmortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells derived kidneys transgenic mice harboring SV40 large little antigens/L-pyruvate kinase hybrid gene. two cell lines, referred PKSV-PCT PKSV-PR cells, maintained long-term passages main biochemical functional properties convoluted terminal parts proximal tubule, respectively, derived. PKSV-PCT cells, gentamicin induced lysosomal alkalinization, decreased cellular N-acetyl-beta-D-glucuronidase, stimulated secretion dose-dependent manner. results indicate models mouse proximal cultured cells could suitable models study cellular action drugs.
