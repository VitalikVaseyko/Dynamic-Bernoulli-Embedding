 examine effect ethanol hepatocarcinogenesis induced choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet, rats fed either ethanol-supplemented diet ethanol-free, isocaloric diet 2 months, followed CDE diet control diet 8 months. Changes cellular composition pattern gene expression liver determined 0 3 days, 1, 2 3 weeks commencing CDE diet, using histological/immunochemical techniques northern analysis. Oval cells liver identified morphologically expression pi-glutathione S-transferase (pi-GST), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) embryonic isoform pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). Oval cell numbers changes pattern gene expression induced CDE diet accelerated pre-treatment ethanol. stages, proportion oval cells test group exceeded controls. 1 week, oval cells spread sufficiently periportal region observed pericentrally test animals 3 weeks, extensive formation ductal structures apparent, absent controls. Additionally, M2-PK AFP mRNA detected earlier, greater abundance animals pre-treated ethanol. 8 months CDE treatment, one two small hepatic foci (<10 hepatocytes), strongly positive pi-GST, detected liver ethanol-pre-treated animals. foci absent CDE-treated animals; however, animals pre-treated ethanol followed chronic CDE treatment showed increased size (>40 hepatocytes) numbers foci, correlating extent liver damage varying 5 50% liver section. data suggest ethanol pre-treatment potentiates short-term effects CDE diet enhancing oval cell proliferation, chronic CDE administration enhances appearance pre-malignant hepatic foci observed ethanol pre-treatment alone.
