 present study investigated anti-obesity effects pomegranate (Punica granatum) juices two Saudi Arabian, Taif red, Taif white, Egyptian pomegranates high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. Administrating used juices decreased body weight gain, food consumption, serum levels lipid, leptin, glucose, increased serum insulin level. Histologically, types juices decreased number size lipid droplets hepatocytes compared obese, non-treated animals. juices types upregulated hepatic mRNA expression hormone-sensitive lipase, pyruvate kinase, adiponectin obese rats; genes suppressed HFD feeding. Additionally, expression fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase1 also upregulated types juices. Conversely, ghrelin mRNA expression downregulated used juices' types. findings demonstrate types tested juices protect HFD-induced obesity rats.
