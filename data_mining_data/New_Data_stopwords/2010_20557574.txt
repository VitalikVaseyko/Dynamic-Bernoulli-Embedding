 role inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) energy carrier central metabolism extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus investigated. agreement annotated genome sequence, cell extracts shown exhibit PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase pyruvate phosphate dikinase activity. addition, membrane-bound pyrophosphatase activity demonstrated, significant cytosolic pyrophosphatase activity detected. exponential growth phase, high PPi levels (approximately 4 +/- 2 mM) relatively low ATP levels (0.43 +/- 0.07 mM) found, PPi/ATP ratio decreased 13-fold cells entered stationary phase. Pyruvate kinase activity appeared allosterically affected PPi. Altogether, findings suggest important role PPi central energy metabolism C. saccharolyticus.
