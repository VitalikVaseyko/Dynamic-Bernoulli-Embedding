 BACKGROUND: Screening programmes exist many countries colorectal cancer. recent years, drive non-invasive screening marker higher sensitivity specificity. Stool-based pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (M2-PK) one biomarker investigation. aim systematic review meta-analysis determine diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity specificity M2-PK screening tool colorectal cancer. METHODS: literature search Ovid Medline, EMBASE Google Scholar carried out. search strategy restricted human subjects studies published English. Data sensitivity specificity extracted pooled. Statistical analysis conducted using summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve methodology. RESULTS: total eight studies suitable data synthesis analysis. analysis showed pooled sensitivity specificity M2-PK 79% (CI 73%-83%) 80% (CI 73%-86%), respectively. accuracy M2-PK 0.85(0.82-0.88). CONCLUSION: Faecal M2-PK assay relatively good sensitivity specificity high accuracy screening colorectal cancer.
