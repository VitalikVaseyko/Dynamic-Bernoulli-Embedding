 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (RMPK) requires activating cations activity, activity allosterically inhibited. study, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) used examine different effects activating cations (K(+) Mg(2+)) inhibitor (Phe) allosteric regulation RMPK. ITC data reveal enthalpy change greater PEP binding active state compared inactive state. Meanwhile, percentage active state increased increasing concentration K(+) Mg(2+), whereas increasing Phe concentration opposite effect. addition, hypothesize activation RMPK involves two processes. First, interaction Mg(2+) leads exposed active site RMPK. process rapid small quantity Mg(2+) make RMPK transform intermediate state. Second, subsequent binding K(+) causes critical orientation active site, plays decisive role PEP binding RMPK Mg(2+).
