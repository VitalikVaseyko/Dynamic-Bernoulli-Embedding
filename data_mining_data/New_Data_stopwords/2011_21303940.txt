 known circadian rhythm hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression (a limiting catalytic step gluconeogenesis) hepatic glucose production maintained daily oscillation autonomic inputs liver night feeding behavior. However, increased glycemia reduced melatonin (Mel) levels recently shown coexist diabetic patients end night period. parallel, pinealectomy (PINX) known cause glucose intolerance increased basal glycemia exclusively end night. mechanisms underlie metabolic feature completely understood. Here, demonstrate PINX rats show night-time hepatic insulin resistance characterized reduced insulin-stimulated RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase phosphorylation increased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression. addition, PINX rats display increased conversion pyruvate glucose end night. regulatory mechanism suggests participation unfolded protein response (UPR), PINX induces night-time increase activating transcription factor 6 expression prompts circadian fashion immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein, activating transcription factor 4, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein expression Zenith values dark period. PINX also caused night-time increase Tribble 3 regulatory-associated protein mammalian target rapamycin; reduced liver PINX rats treated Mel. Treatment PINX rats 4-phenyl butyric acid, inhibitor UPR, restored night-time hepatic insulin sensitivity abrogated gluconeogenesis PINX rats. Altogether, present data show circadian oscillation UPR occurs liver due absence Mel. nocturnal UPR activation related night-time hepatic insulin resistance increased gluconeogenesis PINX rats.
