 Strain DS988, Azotobacter vinelandii mutant reduced capacity accumulate poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate, isolated mini-Tn5 mutagenesis UW136 strain. Cloning nucleotide sequencing affected locus revealed gene homologous Escherichia coli ptsP encodes enzyme INtr, homologue enzyme phosphoenol pyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system N-terminal domain similar N-terminal domain NifA proteins. Strain DS988 unable grow diazotrophically 10 mM glucose carbon source. Diazotrophic growth alternative carbon sources gluconate slightly affected. Glucose uptake, well glucose kinase glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase activities lead synthesis gluconate-6-phosphate, affected ptsP mutation. inability DS988 grow diazotrophically 10 mM glucose overcome supplying ammonium sources fixed nitrogen. Acetylene reduction activity transcription nitrogenase structural gene nifH shown impaired strain DS988 incubated 10 mM glucose. diazotrophic growth defect DS988 restored either increasing glucose concentration 20 mM lowering oxygen concentration. data suggest mutation ptsP leads failure poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate metabolism respiratory protection nitrogenase carbon-limiting conditions.
