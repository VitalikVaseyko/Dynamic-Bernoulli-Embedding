 study ascribes large steady-state D2O isotope effect kcat pyruvate kinase (PEP + ADP----pyruvate + ATP) reprotonation product form enzyme use forming pyruvate. Previous tritium trapping experiments [Rose, I. A., & Kuo, D. J. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 9579-9585] muscle pyruvate kinase showed proton used ketonization enolpyruvate derived enzyme "pool" contains three kinetically equivalent hydrogens could trapped nontritiated "chase" medium high levels ADP PEP. exchange pool medium rapid free enzyme (approximately 1400 s-1), prior addition PEP, apparently much less completed complex. dissociation rate constant determined using dissociation-competition equation koffT = K1/2kcat/Km, kcat/Km steady-state parameter PEP K1/2 concentration PEP required trap 50% isotope could trapped. present study shows competition constant, K1/2, decreased approximately 5-fold D2O, effect see kcat conditions kcat/Km, measured steady state, changed. common effect D2O kcat steady state koffT pulse/chase suggests forward reaction rate determined hydrogen transfer enzyme. evidence indicates kinetically important proton question proton used ketonization enolpyruvate, substrate proton.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
