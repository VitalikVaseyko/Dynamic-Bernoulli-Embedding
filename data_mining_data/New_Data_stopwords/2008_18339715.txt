 IGF-II, potent stimulator cellular proliferation, differentiation, development, regulates uterine function conceptus growth several species. situ hybridization analyses found IGF-II mRNA abundant caruncular endometrial stroma cyclical pregnant ewes. intercaruncular endometrium, IGF-II mRNA transitioned stroma luminal epithelium 14 20 pregnancy. IGF-II mRNA present cells conceptus particularly abundant yolk sac. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed phosphorylated (p)-protooncogenic protein kinase 1, p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase, p-ERK1/2, p-P38 MAPK proteins present low levels majority endometrial cells abundant nuclei endometrial luminal epithelium conceptus trophectoderm pregnant ewes. mononuclear trophectoderm cells isolated d-15 conceptuses, IGF-II increased abundance p-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, p-protooncogenic protein kinase 1, p-glycogen synthase kinase 3B, p-FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1, p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase protein within 15 min, increase maintained 90 min. IGF-II also elicited rapid increase p-ERK1/2 p-P38 MAPK proteins maximal 15 30 min posttreatment. Moreover, IGF-II increased migration trophectoderm cells. Collectively, results support hypothesis IGF-II coordinately activates multiple cell signaling pathways critical survival, growth, differentiation ovine conceptus early pregnancy.
