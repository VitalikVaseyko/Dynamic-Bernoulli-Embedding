 DNA analysis performed 30 unrelated patients hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) found pyruvate kinase (PK) deficient enzyme assay. 19 different mutations identified among 58 60 alleles risk. 13 missense mutations caused single amino acid changes. Included following nucleotide substitutions: 401A, 464C, 993A, 1022C, 1076A, 1178G, 1179A, 1373A, 1378A, 1456T, 1484T, 1493A, 1529A. remaining six mutations follows: two nonsense mutations, 721T 808T; nucleotide deletion, 307C; nucleotide insertion, 1089GG; three nucleotide frame deletion, 391-392-393 deletion 1149 bp PKLR gene resulted loss exon 11. patients studied two polymorphic sites, nucleotide (nt) 1705 A/C microsatellite intron 11, better understand origin mutations. 1529A mutation, common mutation European population, found 25 alleles. single exception mutation linkage disequilibrium polymorphic markers, i.e., found 1705C 14 repeats microsatellite. finding consistent single origin common mutation. mutations occurring much lower frequency 1529A mutation.
