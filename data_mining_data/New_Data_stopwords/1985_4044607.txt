 using low concentrations cells minimize alterations substrate concentrations, demonstrated lactate/pyruvate ratio incubation medium, determines cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, affects gluconeogenic flux suspensions isolated hepatocytes fasted rats. fixed extracellular pyruvate concentration 1 mM lactate/pyruvate ratio varied 0.6 10 50, glucose production rates increased 2.5 5.5 decreased 1.8 nmol/mg cell protein/min. finding paralleled observation Sugano et al. (Sugano, T., Shiota, M., Tanaka, T., Miyamae, Y., Shimada, M., Oshino, N. (1980) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 87, 153-166) noted similar biphasic response perfused liver system lactate held constant pyruvate varied. biphasic relationship explained influence NADH/NAD+ ratio near-equilibrium reactions catalyzed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase hepatocyte cytosol. shifting equilibrium glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, rise NADH/NAD+ ratio decreases concentration 3-phosphoglycerate which, linkage 3-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate two near-equilibrium reactions, reduces concentration phosphoenolpyruvate therefore causes decline flux pyruvate kinase. decrease pyruvate kinase flux results enhanced gluconeogenic flux. higher NADH/NAD+ ratios, however, oxalacetate concentration drops extent consequent decreased flux phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase exceeds decline flux pyruvate kinase, producing decrease gluconeogenic flux. lactate/pyruvate ratio found influence actions three hormones thought stimulate gluconeogenesis different mechanisms. Except inhibition glucagon seen lowest lactate/pyruvate ratio tested, stimulations hormone relatively insensitive lactate/pyruvate ratios, angiotensin II produced greater stimulations gluconeogenesis lactate/pyruvate ratio increased. Dexamethasone, added vitro, stimulated gluconeogenesis significantly low high lactate/pyruvate ratios.
