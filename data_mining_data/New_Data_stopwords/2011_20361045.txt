 Frequent activation AKT serine-threonine kinase cancer confers resistance therapy. AKT activated multi-step process involving phosphatidylinositide (PtdIns) phosphate-mediated recruitment AKT upstream kinases, including 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), inner surface cell membrane. PDK1 appropriate context phosphorylates AKT threonine 308 (T308) activate AKT. Whether PtdIns(3,4,5)Ps (PtdInsP3) binding AKT membrane translocation mediate functions formation functional PDK1::AKT complex fully elucidated. fused complementary fragments intensely fluorescent protein (IFP) AKT1 PDK1 induce stable complex study prerequisites AKT1 phosphorylation function. stabilized PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex, AKT1 T308 phosphorylation independent PtdIns, demonstrated treatment Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. interaction PtdIns cell membrane prevented creating PH-domain mutants AKT1 (R25A) PDK1 (R474A), AKT1 phosphorylation T308 maintained PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex. PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex sufficient phosphorylation known AKT substrates, conferred resistance inhibitors PI3K (LY294002, PI103, GDC0941 TGX286) inhibitors downstream TORC1 complex (rapamycin). Thus locus action targeted therapeutics elucidated constitutively active AKT1 complex. data indicate PtdIns membrane localization required AKT phosphorylation activation, rather serve induce functional physical interaction PDK1 AKT. PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex provides cell-based platform examine specificity drugs targeting PI3K pathway components.
