 Protein aggregation mostly viewed deleterious irreversible causing several pathologies. However, reversible protein aggregation recently emerged novel concept cellular regulation. Here, characterize stress-induced, reversible aggregation yeast pyruvate kinase, Cdc19. Aggregation Cdc19 regulated oligomerization binding allosteric regulators. identify region low compositional complexity (LCR) within Cdc19 necessary sufficient reversible aggregation. exponential growth, shielding LCR within tetrameric Cdc19 phosphorylation LCR prevents unscheduled aggregation, dephosphorylation necessary reversible aggregation stress. Cdc19 aggregation triggers localization stress granules modulates formation dissolution. Reversible aggregation protects Cdc19 stress-induced degradation, thereby allowing cell cycle restart stress. Several enzymes necessary G1 progression also contain LCRs aggregate reversibly stress, implying reversible aggregation represents conserved mechanism regulating cell growth survival.
