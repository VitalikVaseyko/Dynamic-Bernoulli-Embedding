 Frozen storage fish known enhance lipid oxidation, resulting development unpleasant rancid taste odor. Frozen storage fish also known reduce protein solubility, proteins expected oxidatively modified; however, oxidative mechanisms poorly understood. Generally, protein oxidation leads wide range modifications; studied formation carbonyl groups. present work shows, UV spectrophometric determination protein carbonyl groups rainbow trout muscle, storage -20 degrees C resulted 2-fold increase protein carbonylation compared storage -30 -80 degrees C. Furthermore, low-salt-soluble proteins fish either fresh stored 3 years -80 degrees C found similar extents carbonylation. Proteome analysis two-dimensional immunoblotting rainbow trout low-salt- high-salt-soluble proteins gave detailed description protein carbonylation pattern. Several carbonylated proteins identified LC-MS/MS, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, actin, creatine kinase, tropomyosin, myosin light chains 1 2, myosin heavy chain. Furthermore, results showed reduced solubility nucleoside diphosphate kinase fish stored -20 degrees C 2 years compared fish stored -80 degrees C. observed low-abundant proteins could relatively carbonylated high-abundant proteins, thereby indicating proteins susceptible oxidation others, due either cellular localization, amino acid sequence, biochemical function.
