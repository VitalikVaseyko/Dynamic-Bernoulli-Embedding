 perspective highlights advances understanding role cellular metabolism pathogenesis pulmonary hypertension. Insights gained past 20 years revealed several similarities cellular processes underlying pulmonary vascular remodeling pulmonary hypertension seen cancer processes. line insights, increasing recognition abnormal cellular metabolism, notably aerobic glycolysis (the "Warburg effect"), potential involvement hypoxia-inducible factor process, alterations mitochondrial function, key elements pathogenesis disease. glycolytic shift may underlie resistance apoptosis increased vascular cell proliferation, hallmarks pulmonary hypertension. investigations led novel approaches diagnosis therapy pulmonary hypertension.
