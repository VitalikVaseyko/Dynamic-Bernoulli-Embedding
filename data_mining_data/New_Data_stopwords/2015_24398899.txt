 Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) naturally occurring dipeptide shows antineoplastic effects cell culture well animal experiments. Since mode action targets molecular level yet elucidated, performed qRT-PCR experiments RNA isolated glioblastoma cell lines treated carnosine, beta-alanine, L-alanine, L-histidine dipeptide L-alanine-L-histidine. experiments identified strong induction expression gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase 4 (PDK4) influence carnosine L-histidine, substances employed. addition, inhibition cell viability detected cells treated carnosine L-histidine, latter showing significantly stronger effect carnosine. Since tumor cells expressed tissue form carnosinase (CN2) almost serum carnosinase (CN1), conclude cleavage CN2 prerequisite antineoplastic effect carnosine. addition, enhanced expression PDK4 influence carnosine/L-histidine opens new perspective interpretation ergogenic potential dietary beta-alanine supplementation adds new contribution growing body evidence single amino acids regulate key metabolic pathways important health disease.
