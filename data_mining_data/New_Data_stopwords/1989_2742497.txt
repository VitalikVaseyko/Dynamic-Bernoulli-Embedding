 Liver parenchymal cells periportal centrilobular zones differ morphological, biochemical functional characteristics. effort obtain fractions enriched either periportal centrilobular cells, isolated rat liver parenchymal cells separated five subpopulations centrifugal elutriation. mean diameters cells present fractions I-V 19.6, 21.1, 21.8, 22.7 23.5 micron, respectively. content cytochrome P-450 well benzphetamine N-demethylase 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activities higher larger parenchymal cells smaller ones. administration phenobarbital content cytochrome P-450 approximately two-fold greater cells present fractions 3-5, compared subpopulations isolated untreated rats; activity benzphetamine N-demethylase enhanced similar extent five fractions. 3-Methylcholanthrene treatment resulted significant increase cytochrome P-450 content 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity five fractions: parameters slightly higher fractions 4 5 fractions 1 2. conclusion, elutriated liver parenchymal cells seem preserve biochemical heterogeneity observed intact liver; potential enrichment periportal centrilobular cells different fractions centrifugal elutriation discussed.
