 oomycete genus Phytophthora contains world's devastating plant pathogens. report existence P. cinnamomi four genes encoding pyrophosphate-utilizing glycolytic/gluconeogenic enzyme pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (PPDK). coding regions four genes >99% identical. least three genes comprise small gene cluster, may arisen recent gene duplication inversion events. Levels Pdk mRNA low vegetative hyphae, increase rapidly transiently upon transfer cultures nutrient-free media, conditions trigger asexual sporulation. PPDK protein enzyme activity levels show similar increase sporulation. Assays PPDK activity P. cinnamomi hyphal extracts suggest majority glycolytic flux sporulating hyphae probably occurs via PPDK, rather pyruvate kinase. finding, combined existence Phytophthora-expressed sequence tags encoding two pyrophosphate-utilizing enzymes, indicates pyrophosphate-based metabolism may important Phytophthora. possibility PPDK enzymes pyrophosphate-based metabolism may provide targets development novel control measures Phytophthora oomycete pathogens discussed.
