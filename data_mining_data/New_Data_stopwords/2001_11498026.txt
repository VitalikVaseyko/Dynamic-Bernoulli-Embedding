 Effects insulin expression liver-specific genes part adaptive mechanisms aimed maintaining energy homeostasis mammals. diet rich carbohydrates, secreted insulin stimulates expression genes enzymes involved glucose utilization (glucokinase, L-type pyruvate kinase lipogenic enzymes) inhibits genes enzymes involved glucose production (phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase). mechanisms insulin controls expression genes poorly understood. Recently, transcription factor sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1c proposed key mediator insulin transcriptional effects. review evidence led proposal consequences understanding insulin effects physiological pathological conditions.
