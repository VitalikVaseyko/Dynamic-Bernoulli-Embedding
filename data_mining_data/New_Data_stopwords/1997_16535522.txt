 prior work revealed compared case glucose metabolism, increased carbon yield nil acid formation result Bacillus subtilis grows glucose medium containing citrate. scrutinize citrate addition may alter metabolic flux regulation degree observed carbon yield corresponds maximal value, experimental (by least-squares analysis) optimal (by linear programming) fluxes yields contrasted. Networks differing reaction routes, directionality constraints, transhydrogenase activities examined. attain elevated carbon yield, citrate-glucose utilization need alleviate stoichiometric constraints sometimes interfere attainment network objectives. Rather, high carbon yield nil acid formation attained may linked restriction glycolytic capacity, particularly level pyruvate kinase, consistent hypothesized effect coupled metal-citrate uptake. Allowing malic enzyme activity, hexose monophosphate pathway cycling, transhydrogenase activity may also lead flux distributions underlying high carbon yield observed. Finally, observed carbon yield corresponded well maximum yield provided network alternatives examined. Collectively, results suggest (i) observed carbon yield essentially equal maximal values associated plausible networks (ii), suggested others, nonoptimal flux regulation may contribute significantly apparent cellular maintenance requirements.
