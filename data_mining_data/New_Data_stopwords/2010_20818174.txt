 Previously, proposed new model understanding "Warburg effect" tumor metabolism. scheme, cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis resulting energy-rich metabolites transferred epithelial cancer cells, enter TCA cycle, resulting high ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. termed new paradigm "The Reverse Warburg Effect." Here, directly evaluate whether end-products aerobic glycolysis (3-hydroxy-butyrate L-lactate) stimulate tumor growth metastasis, using MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts model system. specifically, show administration 3-hydroxy-butyrate (a ketone body) increases tumor growth approximately 2.5-fold, without measurable increases tumor vascularization/angiogenesis. 3-hydroxy-butyrate L-lactate functioned chemo-attractants, stimulating migration epithelial cancer cells. Although L-lactate increase primary tumor growth, stimulated formation lung metastases approximately 10-fold. Thus, conclude ketones lactate fuel tumor growth metastasis, providing functional evidence support "Reverse Warburg Effect". Moreover, discuss possibility may unwise use lactate-containing i.v. solutions (such Lactated Ringer's Hartmann's solution) cancer patients, given dramatic metastasis-promoting properties L-lactate. Also, provide evidence up-regulation oxidative mitochondrial metabolism TCA cycle human breast cancer cells vivo, via informatics analysis existing raw transcriptional profiles epithelial breast cancer cells adjacent stromal cells. Lastly, findings may explain diabetic patients increased incidence cancer, due increased ketone production, tendency towards autophagy/mitophagy adipose tissue.
