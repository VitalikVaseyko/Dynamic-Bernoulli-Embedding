 diagnostic value pyruvate-kinase type tumor M2 (Tumor M2-PK) investigated different tumors, showed interesting results cases renal cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer cases gastric cancer. study investigated EDTA-plasma 68 patients gastrointestinal cancer, 22 patients inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 60 healthy controls. Sensitivity Tumor M2-PK 70.6% GI-tumors, CA19-9 55.4% CEA 53.3%. pancreatic cancer CA19-9 showed best sensitivity. oesophageal/gastric cancer Tumor M2-PK sensitive colorectal cancer CEA Tumor M2-PK showed best results. specificity Tumor M2-PK 90-96, 7%. IBD individuals showed elevated Tumor M2-PK levels correlation CRP clinical activity score. results indicated Tumor M2-PK might valuable marker gastrointestinal cancer.
