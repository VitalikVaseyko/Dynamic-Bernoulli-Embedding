 Dendritic cells (DCs) play pivotal role polarising Th lymphocyte subsets unclear molecular events occur DCs generate Th2-type responses. Here, analysed plasma membrane-enriched fractions immature, pro-Th1 pro-Th2 DCs used combination iTRAQ labelling LC-MS/MS quantify changes proteomes. Analysis performed triplicate biological samples changes verified flow cytometry. MHC class II molecules CD29 up-regulated pro-Th1 DCs whilst CD18 CD44 up-regulated pro-Th2 DCs. One down-regulated molecules pro-Th1 DCs YM-1 whilst greatest decrease pro-Th2 DCs NAP-22. molecules up-regulated pro-Th2 DC compared pro-Th1 DCs included potentially involved protein folding antigen processing (clathrin Rab-7), whilst non-membrane proteins enzymes/transporters related cell metabolism (malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, ATPase Na(+)/K(+)) also recorded. suggests pro-Th2 DCs metabolically active pro-Th1 DCs mature 'end state'. Overall, although several molecules preferentially expressed pro-Th2 DCs, proteomics data support view 'limited maturation' pro-Th2 DCs compared pro-Th1 DCs.
