 Carbon glycerol palmitate, significantly five carbon sources tested, incorporated lipids suspensions non-growing Mycobacterium leprae organisms. However, five substrates three-citrate, glucose pyruvate-were taken up. Nongrowing Mycobacterium microti Mycobacterium avium incorporated carbon lipids simple carbon sources tested unless obtained growth media including palmitate experimentally infected animals, incorporation carbon lipids carbon sources except palmitate occurred 20 times slowly. Thus, utilization simple carbon appeared repressible utilization one fatty acid tested, palmitate, appeared constitutive. M. leprae, carbon glycerol incorporated glycerol moiety acylglycerols fatty acid moieties free fatty acids. M. microti M. avium incorporated carbon simple carbon sources fatty acids, even (though slowly) organisms obtained host tissue. Isocitrate lyase, malate synthase acetate kinase detected M. leprae. However acetyl-CoA synthetase detectable phosphoacetylase deficient; thus, M. leprae may incapable making acetyl-CoA acetate. Phosphotransacetylase readily detected host-grown M. avium M. microti.
