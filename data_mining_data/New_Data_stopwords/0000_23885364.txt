 ability cells regulate levels reactive oxygen species (ROS) vital controlling many aspects proliferation survival discovered pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) important cancer cell biology. PKM2 directly oxidized Cys(358) inhibit catalytic activity, allows diversion glucose-6-phosphate pentose phosphate pathway. This, turn, allows synthesis NADPH, critical generating reduced glutathione, necessary ROS detoxification. cellular context, PKM2 activator, ML285 protects enzyme oxidation ROS results sensitization oxidative stress increased apoptosis.
