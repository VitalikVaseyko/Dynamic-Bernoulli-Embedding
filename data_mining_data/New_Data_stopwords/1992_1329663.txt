 Recently reported presence guanylyl cyclase-linked (116 kDa) ANF-C (66 kDa) atrial natriuretic peptide receptors rat liver. Since ANF 103-125 (atriopeptin II) stimulates cGMP production livers cGMP previously shown mimic actions cAMP regulating hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, studies performed investigate effects atriopeptin II hepatic glycolysis gluconeogenesis. Additionally, employing analogs atrial natriuretic hormone [des-(Q116, S117, G118, L119, G120) ANF 102-121 (C-ANF) des-(C105,121) ANF 104-126 (analog I)] bind ANF-C receptors, role ANF-C receptors hepatic actions atriopeptin II evaluated. perfused livers fed rats atriopeptin II, C-ANF analog I, inhibited hepatic glycolysis stimulated glucose production. Moreover, analog alter ability atriopeptin II inhibit hepatic glycolysis. Atriopeptin II, C-ANF analog I, also stimulated cGMP production perfused rat livers. Furthermore, atriopeptin II inhibited activity ratio pyruvate kinase 30%, C-ANF alter hepatic pyruvate kinase activity. Finally, rat hepatocytes, atriopeptin II stimulated synthesis [14C]glucose [2-14C]pyruvate 50% effect atriopeptin II mimicked exogenously supplied cGMP analog, 8-bromo cGMP. Thus atriopeptin II increases hepatic gluconeogenesis inhibits glycolysis, part inhibiting pyruvate kinase activity, effects atriopeptin II mediated via activation guanylyl cyclase-linked ANF receptors elevate cGMP production.
