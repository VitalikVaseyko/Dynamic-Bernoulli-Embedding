 Prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha), precursor thymosin alpha1 thymosin alpha11, 109-111 amino acids protein widely distributed mammalian tissues essential cell proliferation survival implication chromatin remodeling proapoptotic activity. ProTalpha phosphorylated Thr residues M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase process dependent cell proliferation activity, constitutes novel dual functionality enzyme. Thr residues phosphorylated apparently dependent carcinogenic transformation cells. Thus, normal lymphocytes residues Thr11 Thr12 phosphorylated addition Thr7 residue, tumor cells Thr7 residue phosphorylated. Phosphorylation ProTalpha seems related antiapoptotic activity, although possibilities cannot discarded.
