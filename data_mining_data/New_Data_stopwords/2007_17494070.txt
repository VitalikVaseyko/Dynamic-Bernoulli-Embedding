 Relatively little known functional genomic level global host response human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Microarray analyses several laboratories, including own, revealed HIV-1 infection causes significant changes host mRNA abundance regulation several cellular biological pathways. However, remains unclear consequences changes bring protein level. report expression levels approximately 3,200 proteins CD4(+) CEMx174 cell line infection LAI strain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1); proteins assessed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled stable isotope labeling accurate mass time tag approach. Furthermore, found 687 (21%) proteins changed abundance peak virus production 36 h postinfection. Pathway analysis revealed differential expression proteins concentrated select biological pathways, exemplified ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes ubiquitination, carrier proteins nucleocytoplasmic transport, cyclin-dependent kinase cell cycle progression, pyruvate dehydrogenase citrate cycle pathways. Moreover, observed changes abundance proteins known interactions HIV-1 viral proteins. proteomic analysis captured changes host protein milieu time robust virus production, depicting changes cellular processes may contribute virus replication. Continuing analyses expected focus blocking virus replication targeting pathways effector proteins.
