 Changes energy metabolism maternal leukocytes studied longitudinally 33 normal term pregnancies 12, 20 36 weeks gestation 40 days post partum. Nutrient intakes calculated 3-day weighed food records periods. Women tended decrease mean dietary intakes energy nutrients early late pregnancy. Glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (G6P-DH), pyruvic kinase (PK) adenylate kinase (AK) activities rose significantly 12th week pregnancy, reaching maximal values week 20. following period week 36 showed significant decrease continued puerperium, values lowest. Adenine nucleotide contents protein/DNA ratio followed different pattern. significant increase also observed weeks 12 20, remaining without changes second half gestation, falling puerperium. PK AK activities showed positive correlation energy intake 36 weeks gestation AK activity negatively correlated folic acid intake middle pregnancy. week 20, PK activity showed positive correlation head circumference body mass index newborn. also correlation protein/DNA ratio head circumference 36th week gestation. findings may suggest relationship metabolism maternal leukocytes, fetal development utero.
