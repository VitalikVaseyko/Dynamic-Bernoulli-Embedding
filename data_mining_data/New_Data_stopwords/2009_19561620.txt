 describe Scaffold Hunter, highly interactive computer-based tool navigation chemical space fosters intuitive recognition complex structural relationships associated bioactivity. program reads compound structures bioactivity data, generates compound scaffolds, correlates hierarchical tree-like arrangement, annotates bioactivity. Brachiation along tree branches structurally complex simple scaffolds allows identification new ligand types. provide proof concept pyruvate kinase.
