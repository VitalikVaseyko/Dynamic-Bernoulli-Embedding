 Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), universal solvent, frequently used dissolve various classes chemicals evaluation biological activities. one evaluation, noticed DMSO caused cellular proliferation interfered high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI)-mediated degranulation mast cells. DMSO caused cellular proliferation RBL-2H3 cells phosphorylating extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) M2-type pyruvate kinase (M2PK) enzymatic activity M2PK reduced. Allergenic activation FcepsilonRI caused tyrosine phosphorylations signaling components FcepsilonRI, Syk, PLCgamma1, PLCgamma2, ERK, M2PK. allergenic activated RBL-2H3 cells, DMSO specifically inhibited FcepsilonRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation M2PK, blocked FcepsilonRI-mediated inhibition enzymatic activity M2PK, inhibited FcepsilonRI-mediated degranulation. results suggest DMSO causes cellular proliferation mast cell degranulation differential modulation M2PK resting allergenic activated cells.
