 11-year-old female crossbred dog showed signs polyuria, polydipsia, vomiting, posterior weakness ataxia. Clinical laboratory findings suggested diagnosis polycythaemia vera. haematological values shown six-month period presented. four samples aspects erythrocyte function (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] pyruvate kinase [PK] activities, 2,3 diphosphoglycerate [2,3 DPG] concentration, osmotic fragility intracellular sodium potassium concentrations) studied. Variable activities G6PD PK, probably related different reticulocyte number, detected together normal osmotic fragility intracellular sodium potassium concentrations. 2,3 DPG concentration higher normal four samples. could interpreted response low tissue perfusion rather higher content 2,3 DPG red blood cells polycythaemic dog.
