 Cystinosis disorder associated excessive lysosomal cystine accumulation secondary defective cystine efflux. Patients affected disease develop variable degree symptoms depending involved tissues. Accumulation cystine myocardium may lead heart failure. However, mechanisms cystine toxic tissues fully understood. Considering thiolic enzymes like pyruvate kinase (PK) may altered disulfides like cystine, main objective present study investigate effect cystine PK activity heart developing rats. performed kinetic studies investigated effects reduced glutathione (GSH), biologically occurring thiol groups protector, cysteamine, drug used cystinosis treatment, enzyme activity. observed cystine inhibited enzyme activity non-competitively dose- time-dependent way. also observed GSH cysteamine fully prevented reversed inhibition caused cystine, suggesting cystine inhibits PK activity oxidation sulfhydryl groups enzyme. Although definite proof cystine within cytoplasm, indirect proof able escape lysosomes come contact PK. Considering cysteamine used patients cystinosis causes parenchymal organ cystine depletion, present data provide possible new effect drug.
