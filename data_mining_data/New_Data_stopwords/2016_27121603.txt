 KEY POINTS: Intestinal ischaemia causes epithelial death crypt dysfunction, leading barrier defects gut bacteria-derived septic complications. Enteral glucose protects ischaemic injury; however, roles played glucose metabolites pyruvate ATP epithelial death crypt dysfunction remain elusive. novel form necrotic death involves assembly phosphorylation receptor interacting protein kinase 1/3 complex found ischaemic enterocytes. Pyruvate suppressed epithelial cell death ATP-independent manner failed maintain crypt function. Conversely, replenishment ATP partly restored crypt proliferation effect epithelial necroptosis ischaemic gut. data argue traditional view ATP main cytoprotective factor glucose metabolism, indicate novel anti-necroptotic role glycolytic pyruvate ischaemic stress. ABSTRACT: Mesenteric ischaemia/reperfusion induces epithelial death forms apoptosis necrosis, leading villus denudation gut barrier damage. remains unclear whether programmed cell necrosis [i.e. receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP)-dependent necroptosis] involved ischaemic injury. Previous studies demonstrated enteral glucose uptake sodium-glucose transporter 1 ameliorated ischaemia/reperfusion-induced epithelial injury, partly via anti-apoptotic signalling maintenance crypt proliferation. Glucose metabolism generally assumed cytoprotective; however, roles played glucose metabolites (e.g. pyruvate ATP) epithelial cell death crypt dysfunction remain elusive. present study aimed investigate cytoprotective effects exerted distinct glycolytic metabolites ischaemic gut. Wistar rats subjected mesenteric ischaemia enterally instilled glucose, pyruvate liposomal ATP. results showed intestinal ischaemia caused RIP1-dependent epithelial necroptosis villus destruction accompanied reduction crypt proliferation. Enteral glucose uptake decreased epithelial cell death increased crypt proliferation, ameliorated mucosal histological damage. Instillation cell-permeable pyruvate suppressed epithelial cell death ATP-independent manner improved villus morphology failed maintain crypt function. Conversely, administration liposomal ATP partly restored crypt proliferation reduce epithelial necroptosis histopathological injury. Lastly, glucose pyruvate attenuated mucosal-to-serosal macromolecular flux prevented enteric bacterial translocation upon blood reperfusion. conclusion, glucose metabolites protect ischaemic injury distinct modes sites, including inhibition epithelial necroptosis pyruvate promotion crypt proliferation ATP.
