 Tumor cells trends express high level pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). inhibition PKM2 activity needed antioxidant response diverting glucose flux pentose phosphate pathway thus generating sufficient reducing potential. report PKM2 succinylated lysine 498 (K498) succinylation increases activity. SIRT5 binds to, desuccinylates inhibits PKM2 activity. Increased level reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreases succinylation activity PKM2 increasing binding SIRT5. Substitution endogenous PKM2 succinylation mimetic mutant K498E decreases cellular NADPH production inhibits cell proliferation tumor growth. Moreover, inhibition SIRT5 suppresses tumor cell proliferation desuccinylation PKM2 K498. results reveal new mechanism PKM2 modification, new function SIRT5 response oxidative stress stimulates cell proliferation tumor growth, also potential target clinical cancer research.
