 Cerebral ischaemia associated brain damage inhibition neuronal protein synthesis. deficit neuronal metabolism altered excitatory amino acid release may contribute phenomena. present study, demonstrate NMDA metabolic impairment 2-deoxyglucose inhibitors mitochondrial respiration inhibit protein synthesis cortical neurons phosphorylation eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF-2), without change phosphorylation initiation factor eIF-2alpha. eEF-2 kinase may activated Ca(2+)-independent AMP kinase increase cytosolic Ca2+. Although NMDA decreases ATP levels neurons, effects 2-deoxyglucose protein synthesis phosphorylation elongation factor eEF-2 reversed Na(+) pyruvate. Protein synthesis inhibition 2-deoxyglucose result secondary release glutamate cortical neurons prevented NMDA receptor antagonist 5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-(a,d)-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK 801), increase cytosolic-free Ca2+. Conversely, 2-deoxyglucose likely activates eEF-2 kinase process involving phosphorylation AMP kinase. conclusion, provide evidence protein synthesis inhibited NMDA metabolic deprivation two distinct mechanisms involving, respectively, Ca(2+)-dependent Ca(2+)-independent eEF-2 phosphorylation.
