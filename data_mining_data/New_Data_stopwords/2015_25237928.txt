 Survival rate ovarian cancer improved since chemotherapy introduced decades ago. dismal prognosis mostly due disease recurrence majority patients succumb disease. demonstration tumors comprised subfractions cancer cells displaying heterogeneity stemness potential, chemoresistance, tumor repair capacity suggests recurrence may driven chemoresistant cancer stem cells. Thus improve patient survival, novel therapies eradicate cancer cell population. show contrast differentiated ovarian cancer cells, putative CD44+/MyD88+ ovarian cancer stem cells express lower levels pyruvate dehydrogenase, Cox-I, Cox-II, Cox-IV, higher levels UCP2. Together, molecular phenotype establishes bioenergetic profile prefers use glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation generate ATP. bioenergetic profile conserved vivo therefore maintenance regimen 2-deoxyglucose administered Paclitaxel treatment able delay progression recurrent tumors decrease tumor burden mice. findings strongly suggest value maintenance glycolysis inhibitors goal improving survival ovarian cancer patients.
