 1. substantial increase initial rate ATP hydrolysis observed preincubation bovine heart submitochondrial particles phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. 2. activation accompanied increase Vmax, without change Km ATP. 3. activated particles catalysed biphasic hydrolysis ATP presence ATP-regenerating system; initial rapid phase followed second, slower, phase time-dependent fashion. 4. higher ATP concentration used substrate, higher rate transition two phases. 5. particles catalysed hydrolysis ITP lag phase; preincubation phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase, ITP hydrolysed constant rate. 6. Qualitatively phenomena observed soluble mitochondrial ATPase (F1-ATPase) prepared conventional method presence ATP used nucleotide triphosphatase. 7. kinetic scheme proposed, intermediate active enzyme-product complex (E.ADP) formed ATP hydrolysis slow equilibrium inactive E*.ADP complex forming result dislocation ADP active site ATPase site, rapid equilibrium surrounding medium.
