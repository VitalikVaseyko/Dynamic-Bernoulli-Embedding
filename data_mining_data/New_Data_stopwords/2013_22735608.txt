 INTRODUCTION: Colonoscopy workload endoscopy services Western countries increasing markedly implementation faecal occult blood-based mass screening programmes colorectal cancer (CRC). therefore explored possibility using combination faecal tests prioritize access colonoscopy criteria symptoms and/or time referral. AIMS METHODS: tested combination faecal tests [immunochemical faecal occult blood test (i-FOBT), M2-PK, calprotectin] markers advanced neoplasia selected series patients requiring colonoscopy suspicion CRC. tests performed 1-day stool sample patients aged 50-80 years, without dietary restriction, colonoscopy. RESULTS: total 280 patients' stool single samples analysed. Forty-seven patients CRC 85 patients one advanced adenoma(s) colonoscopy/histology. CRCs associated highly significant increase (P<0.001) faecal tumour M2-PK (mean 24.2 kU/l), correlated Dukes' staging. CRC detection, i-FOBT test highest specificity positive predictive value (0.89 0.53), whereas M2-PK highest sensitivity negative predictive value (0.87 0.96). Calprotectin showed performance similar M2-PK terms sensitivity negative predictive value (0.93), lower specificity (0.39). best combination tests predict risk CRC series i-FOBT+M2-PK, patients showing positivity markers, risk cancer high 79%. CONCLUSION: combination i-FOBT M2-PK sensitive tool clinical practice appropriate management waiting lists colonoscopy, allows classification patients different degrees priority investigation, according foreseeable risk CRC.
