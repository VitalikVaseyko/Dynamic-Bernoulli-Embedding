 new reactive fluorescent ADP analog synthesized: 2-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5'-diphosphate (2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP). Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase inactivated 200 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP biphasic manner, initial loss 75% activity followed slow total inactivation. rate constants phases exhibit nonlinear dependence reagent concentration, consistent reversible formation enzyme-reagent complex (KI = 133 microM) prior irreversible reaction. Loss activity prevented substrates. best protection inactivation provided phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), KCl, MnSO4, suggesting reaction occurs region PEP binding site. Incorporation 1.7 mol/mol enzyme subunit accompanies 90% inactivation 200 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP 80 min. However, presence PEP, KCl, MnSO4, 1.0 mol reagent incorporated enzyme 14% inactivated. results indicate 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP reacts two groups enzyme, one near PEP binding site. Incubation pyruvate kinase related nucleotide analogs lacking 5'-diphosphate diketo group suggests diketo group, diphosphate, essential inactivation. enolized form bromodioxobutyl group resembles phosphoenolpyruvate probably directs reagent PEP binding site. Modified enzyme, prepared incubating pyruvate kinase 200 microM 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP absence presence phosphoenolpyruvate, KCl, MnSO4, reduced [3H]NaBH4, carboxymethylated, digested trypsin. Nucleotidyl peptides isolated chromatography phenylboronateagarose followed reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Two radioactive peptides identified: Asn162-Ile-Cys-Lys165 Ile141-Thr-Leu-Asp-Asn-Ala-Tyr-Met-Glu-Lys150. tetrapeptide modified presence PEP, KCl, Mn+ enzyme retained activity. Cys164 thus designated nonessential modified residue, modification Tyr147 near active site pyruvate kinase responsible loss enzymatic activity. observed biphasic kinetics inactivation due negatively cooperative reaction 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP Tyr147 tetramer. new compound, 2-BDB-T epsilon A-5'-DP, may general application affinity label ADP PEP sites proteins.
