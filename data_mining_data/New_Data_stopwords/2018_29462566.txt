 Treatment non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) focuses underlying metabolic syndrome, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) remains one effective options. rodents human patients, RYGB induces increase gene protein expression levels M2 isoenzyme Pyruvate Kinase (PKM2) jejunum. Since PKM2 secreted circulation, hypothesis circulating levels PKM2 increase RYGB. data, however, revealed unexpected finding potential new role PKM2 natural history metabolic syndrome NAFLD. Contrary initial hypothesis, RYGB-treated patients decreased PKM2 blood levels compared well-matched group patients severe obesity prior RYGB. Interestingly, PKM2 serum concentration correlated BMI surgery. prompted us evaluate potential mechanisms sites PKM2 regulation metabolic syndrome RYGB. found patients NAFLD NASH, liver increased PKM2 expression levels, enzyme appears specifically localized Kupffer cells. study murine models metabolic syndrome NASH replicated pattern expression, suggesting metabolic link hepatic PKM2 NAFLD. Therefore, conclude PKM2 serum hepatic levels increase metabolic syndrome NAFLD decrease RYGB. Thus, PKM2 may represent new target monitoring treatment NAFLD.
