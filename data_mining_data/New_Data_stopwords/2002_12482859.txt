 Evidence direct binding pyruvate kinase tubulin/microtubule inhibitory effect phosphoenolpyruvate tubulin-enzyme hetero-association provided surface plasmon resonance pelleting experiments. Electron microscopy revealed pyruvate kinase induces depolymerization paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules large oligomeric aggregates bundles tubules salt concentration-dependent manner. C-terminal "tail"-free microtubules bind pyruvate kinase, suggesting crucial role C-terminal segments binding kinase. Immunoblotting polymerization experiments cell-free brain extract revealed pyruvate kinase specifically binds microtubules, binding pyruvate kinase impedes microtubule assembly, phosphoenolpyruvate counteracts destabilization microtubules induced pyruvate kinase. also showed immunostaining juxtanuclear localization pyruvate kinase intact L929 cells localization influenced treatments paclitaxel vinblastine. findings suggest distribution enzyme may controlled microtubular network vivo.
