 Recent studies vivo roles sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) family indicate SREBP-2 specific cholesterogenic gene expression whereas SREBP-1 targets lipogenic genes. define molecular mechanism involved differential regulation, luciferase-reporter gene assays performed HepG2 cells compare transactivities nuclear SREBP-1a, -1c, -2 battery SREBP-target promoters containing sterol regulatory element (SRE), SRE-like, E-box sequences. results show first cholesterogenic genes containing classic SREs promoters strongly efficiently activated SREBP-1a SREBP-2, SREBP-1c. Second, E-box containing reporter gene much less efficiently activated SREBP-1a -1c, SREBP-2 inactive spite ability bind E-box. Third, promoters lipogenic enzymes containing variations SRE (SRE-like sequences) strongly activated SREBP-1a, modestly equally SREBP-1c -2. Finally, substitution unique tyrosine residue within basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) portion nuclear SREBPs arginine, conserved residue found bHLH proteins, abolishes transactivity SREBPs SRE, conversely results markedly increased activity SREBP-1 activity SREBP-2 E-boxes. data demonstrate different specificity affinity nuclear SREBP-1 -2 different target DNAs, explaining part mechanism behind differential vivo regulation cholesterogenic lipogenic enzymes SREBP-1 -2, respectively.
