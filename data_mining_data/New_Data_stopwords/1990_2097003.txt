 effects vitamin intramuscular distribution total bound calcium, phosphate available cytosolic calcium, investigated skeletal muscle. Total calcium phosphorus measured ashed subcellular fractions muscles vitamin D-repleted vitamin D-deprived rats. variations available calcium followed determining activities calcium-sensitive enzymes isolated cytosol. Bound-calcium revealed ultra-microscopically pyroantimonate. vitamin D-repleted muscles, pyroantimonate method revealed specific areas intense bound-calcium deposition: myofibrils, formed pronounced lines parallel Z-bands. vitamin D-deficient muscles, calcium-pyroantimonate deposits appeared clearly reduced. loss accompanied marked reduction total calcium phosphorus subcellular fractions, compared vitamin D-repleted muscles. Unexpectedly, activity Ca(+)-activated isocitrate-dehydrogenase increased cytosol, Ca2(+)-inhibited pyruvate-kinase decreased. Prolonged vitamin D-administration vitamin D-repleted rats led intensification calcium-pyroantimonate deposits general increase total calcium phosphorus, change cytosolic Ca2(+)-sensitive enzyme activities. Cessation vitamin D-administration vitamin D-repleted rats produced regression calcium-pyroantimonate deposits, general decrease total calcium phosphate levels, stimulation Ca2(+)-activated isocitrate-dehydrogenase accompanied lowering Ca2(+)-inhibited pyruvate-kinase. results clearly indicate correlation vitamin D-repletion total bound calcium content skeletal muscle. addition, demonstrate apparent contradiction decrease total bound calcium, activities cytosolic Ca2+ sensitive enzymes vitamin D-deprivation, explained increase available calcium. suggested vitamin stimulates intramuscular mechanisms tending lower available calcium inactivating cation via formation calcium chelates.
