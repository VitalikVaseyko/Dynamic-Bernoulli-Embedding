 OBJECTIVE: evaluate clinical significance blood fecal expression tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (Tumor M2-PK) patients colorectal cancer. METHODS: 22 healthy subjects controls, 44 patients CRC examined tumor M2-PK serum fecal samples using sandwich enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: sensitivity serum fecal tumor M2-PK detecting CRC 59.1% 63.6% specificity 86.4% 81.8%, respectively. serum fecal levels tumor M2-PK showed significant correlation CRC patients. CONCLUSION: Tumor M2-PK good sensitivity specificity diagnosis CRC.
