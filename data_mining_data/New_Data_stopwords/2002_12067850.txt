 study investigated whether hyperoxic breathing (100% O(2)) increasing oxidative substrate supply [dichloroacetate (DCA) infusion] would increase oxidative phosphorylation reduce reliance substrate phosphorylation onset high-intensity aerobic exercise. Eight male subjects cycled 90% maximal O(2) uptake (VO(2 max)) 90 three randomized conditions: 1) normoxic breathing saline infusion 1 h immediately exercise (CON), 2) normoxic breathing saline infusion DCA (100 mg/kg body wt), 3) hyperoxic breathing 20 min rest exercise saline infusion (HYP). Muscle biopsies vastus lateralis sampled rest 30 90 exercise. DCA infusion increased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activation CON HYP (3.10 +/- 0.23, 0.56 +/- 0.08, 0.69 +/- 0.05 mmol x kg wet muscle(-1) x min(-1), respectively) significantly increased acetyl-CoA acetylcarnitine (11.0 +/- 0.7, 2.0 +/- 0.5, 2.2 +/- 0.5 mmol/kg dry muscle, respectively) rest. However, DCA HYP alter phosphocreatine degradation lactate accumulation and, therefore, reliance substrate phosphorylation 30 (CON, 51.2 +/- 5.4; DCA, 56.5 +/- 7.1; HYP, 69.5 +/- 6.3 mmol ATP/kg dry muscle) 90 exercise (CON, 90.6 +/- 9.5; DCA, 107.2 +/- 13.0; HYP, 101.2 +/- 15.2 mmol ATP/kg dry muscle). data suggest rate oxidative phosphorylation onset exercise 90% VO(2 max) limited oxygen availability active muscle substrate availability (metabolic inertia) level PDH aerobically trained subjects.
