 Subclinical nutritional myopathy induced 5-month-old sheep feeding diet low vitamin E selenium. Subsequently clinical myopathy induced dosing protected polyunsaturated fatty acids. Plasma activities creatine kinase (CK), pyruvate kinase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase aldolase, enzymes muscle origin, remained reference ranges clinically affected sheep, fluctuated widely. Similar fluctuations occurred subclinically affected animals, resulting activities within reference ranges above, different times. Plasma malondialdehyde, indicator lipid peroxidation, proved diagnostic value. Terminal plasma CK activities significantly correlated microscopic damage vastus lateralis (VL), vastus intermedius (VI) tensor fascia lata (TFL) muscles. AST highly correlated damage VI VL. two clinically affected sheep successfully treated oral dose alpha-tocopherol acetate enzymes decreased steadily within reference ranges, rates probably related plasma half-lives. results suggest measurement plasma CK activity would useful monitoring recovery treated sheep.
