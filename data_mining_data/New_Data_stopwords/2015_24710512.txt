 Shikonin, small-molecule natural product inhibits activity pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), studied anti-cancer drug candidate human cancer models. Here, results demonstrate shikonin able sensitize human breast cancer cells chemotherapy paclitaxel (taxol). Human breast adenocarcinoma MBA-MD-231 cells, higher levels PKM2 expression activity compared MCF-7 cells, selected study further. concentrations shikonin taxol first selected significantly induce cytotoxicity treated alone, whereas combination induced apoptosis. Surprisingly, PKM2 activity decreased shikonin, combination treatment. identify potential targets combination, human phospho-kinase antibody array analysis performed results indicated combination treatment inhibited activation ERK, Akt, p70S6 kinases, known contribute breast cancer progression. Finally, combination affects breast cancer cell growth vivo tested using xenograft tumor model. results indicated shikonin plus taxol prolonged animal survival reduced tumor size vehicle treatment group. summary, results suggest shikonin potential adjuvant breast cancer therapy.
