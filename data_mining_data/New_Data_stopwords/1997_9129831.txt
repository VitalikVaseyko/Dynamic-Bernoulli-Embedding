 conformations MgATP AMP bound monomeric tryptic fragment methionyl tRNA synthetase investigated two-dimensional proton transferred nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (TRNOESY). sample protocol chosen minimize contributions adventitious binding nucleotides observed NOE. experiments performed 500 MHz three different complexes, E.MgATP, E.MgATP.L-methioninol, E.AMP.L-methioninol. starter set distances obtained fitting NOE build-up curves (not involving H5' H5") used determine CHARMm energy-minimized structure. positioning H5' H5" protons determined basis conformational search torsion angle obtain best fit observed NOEs superposed resonance. Using structure, relaxation matrix set calculate theoretical build-up curves NOEs compare observed curves. final structures deduced adenosine moieties three complexes similar, described glycosidic torsion angle (chi) 56 degrees +/- 5 degrees phase angle pseudorotation (P) range 47 degrees 52 degrees, describing 3(4)T-4E sugar pucker. glycosidic torsion angle, chi, deduced adenylyl transfer enzyme determined previously three phosphoryl transfer enzymes (creatine kinase, arginine kinase, pyruvate kinase), one pyrophosphoryl enzyme (PRibPP synthetase), range 52 degrees +/- 8 degrees. narrow range values suggests possible common motif recognition binding adenosine moiety active sites ATP-utilizing enzymes, irrespective point cleavage phosphate chain.
