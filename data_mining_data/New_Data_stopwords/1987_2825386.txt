 effect thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) activity rat liver pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulatory enzymes (kinase phosphatase) studied experiments isolated enzyme preparations. shown ThDP caused pronounced activation pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (Ka equal 65.0 nM). ThTP inhibits phosphatase competitively substrate--the phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. thiamine phosphates inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity almost similarly concentrations exceeding 10 microM. physiological significance antagonistic action ThDP ThTP pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase activity discussed.
