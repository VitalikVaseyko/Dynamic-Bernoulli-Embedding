 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency frequent red cell enzymatic defect responsible hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. clinical picture quite variable reasons variability partially clarified. report clinical description extended molecular analysis 3 PK deficient patients clinical phenotype variable severity. studied clinical hematological aspects 3 patients analyzed following genes: pyruvate kinase-R, glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, alpha-globin, uridindiphosphoglucuronil transferase HFE. One patient (A) severe clinical picture resulted homozygote exon 8 nt994A substitution, 2 (brothers) compound heterozygotes exon 8 nt994A exon 11 nt1456T mutation. One two brothers severe phenotype coinherited also G6PD deficiency, microcytosis due homozygosity non-deletional form alpha-thalassemia ATG-->ACG substitution initiation codon alpha2 globin gene. results suggest extended molecular analysis useful studying several interacting gene mutations contribute clinical variability pyruvate kinase deficiency.
