 last decade surge interest activity exploring metabolic links copper iron. review describes century half effort led current understanding. Particular attention given early events since less well-known appreciated. landmark 1928 paper Hart, Elvehjem coworkers generally given credit start copper/iron field, specifically discovery role copper forming hemoglobin overcoming anemia. However, credit ideas, observations, experiments shared several investigators previous century. scientists physicians primarily motivated find causes cures chlorosis, common form anemia time. chemical determination copper red blood cells 1848, Millon proposed form chlorosis due copper deficiency. Likewise, Pecholier Saint-Pierre, observing robust health young women working copper factories, concluded copper helpful preventing overcoming chlorosis. first direct experimental evidence theory provided Italian physician Mendini, 1862 reported supplementation diet copper salts overcame chlorosis young women. 1890s Cervello students Italy, using semi-quantitative hematological measurements, confirmed beneficial effects copper anemia patients animal models. nearly 30-year period inactivity, decade 1930s saw renewed interest exciting developments field. Elvehjem report 1928 quickly verified extended multiple laboratories four continents. 1950s 1960s Wintrobe Cartwright colleagues localized, started systematically evaluate, potential sites copper likely effect iron hemoglobin synthesis, namely, intestinal absorption, release storage, cellular utilization synthesis. copper/iron connection also 'flip-side', i.e., iron status influence copper metabolism first described Warburg Krebs 1927. Thus, opportunities feedback mechanisms cellular physiological level yet understood. evaluation processes continues day, aided modern molecular genetic approaches. Studies two copper proteins, ceruloplasmin recently discovered homologue hephaestin, provided two molecular links connecting pathways copper iron metabolism. recent identification proteins iron copper metabolism, example, copper ATPases membrane iron transporters DCT1/DMT1/Nramp2 IREG1/MTP1/ferroportinl, likely fill crucial pathway gaps. ongoing discovery genes gene mutations involved metabolism copper iron provides important key deeper understanding connections pathways, physiological pathological consequences. hoped historical review, illuminating complex paths led current state knowledge, contribute appreciation, understanding, perhaps continued discovery connections copper iron.
