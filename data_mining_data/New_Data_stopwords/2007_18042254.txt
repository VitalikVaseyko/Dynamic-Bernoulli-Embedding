 Autonomous parvoviruses strongly dependent phosphorylation major non-structural protein NS1 members protein kinase C (PKC) family. Besides accompanied changes overall phosphorylation pattern NS1 acquiring new modifications consensus PKC sites, ongoing minute virus mice (MVM) infections lead appearance new phosphorylated cellular protein species. prompted us investigate whether MVM actively interferes phosphoinositol-dependent kinase (PDK)/PKC signalling. activity, subcellular localization phosphorylation status protein kinases PDK1, PKCeta PKClambda measured A9 cells presence absence MVM infection. Parvovirus infection found result activation PDK1 PKCeta, evidenced changes subcellular distribution overall (auto)phosphorylation. show evidence activation PKCeta PDK1 driven atypical PKClambda. modifying hydrophobic motif PKCeta, PKClambda appeared control docking consecutive phosphorylation PKCeta's activation-loop PDK1, process inhibited vivo presence dominant-negative PKClambda mutant.
