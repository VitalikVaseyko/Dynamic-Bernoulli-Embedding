 determined effect butyrate short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) rates lipolysis 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Prolonged treatment butyrate (5 mM) increased rate lipolysis approximately 2-3-fold. Aminobutyric acid acetate little effect lipolysis, however propionate stimulated lipolysis, suggesting butyrate propionate act shared activity histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Consistent this, HDAC inhibitor trichostatin (1 microM) also stimulated lipolysis similar extent butyrate. Western blot data suggested neither mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation perilipin down-regulation necessary SCFA-induced lipolysis. Stimulation lipolysis butyrate trichostatin glucose-dependent. Changes AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation mediated glucose independent changes rates lipolysis. glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetate prevented butyrate- tumor necrosis factor-alpha-(TNF-alpha) mediated increases rates lipolysis indicating glucose metabolism required. However, unlike TNF-alpha- , butyrate-stimulated lipolysis associated increased lactate release inhibited activation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) dichloroacetate. data demonstrate important relationship lipolytic activity reported HDAC inhibitory activity butyrate, short-chain fatty acids trichostatin A. Given HDAC inhibitors presently evaluated treatment diabetes disorders, work essential determine effects lipolysis due inhibition HDAC.
