 multiple enzyme multisubstrate cycling system described radiometric determination cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) activity crude tissue homogenates. methods employs [14C]acetate coupled enzymes acetate kinase (AK) phosphotransacetylase (PTA) generation [14C]acetyl CoA. recycling possible avoid product inhibition ChAT CoA, ATP maintained constant rephosphorylation ADP. Kinetics individual enzyme reactions studied parameters obtained used select appropriate conditions maintain linearity varying amounts ChAT activity sixty minute time course. sensitivity method limited specific activity commercially available isotope labeled acetate.
