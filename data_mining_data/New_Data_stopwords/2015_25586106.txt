 Metabolic oncology exciting new field cancer research, offering new window cancer's molecular plasticity promise development effective, cancer-selective therapies novel biomarkers. based realization cancer's unique metabolism (known since Warburg's report 1923) suppression mitochondrial glucose oxidation upregulation cytoplasmic glycolysis secondary primary event, offering many growth advantages cancer cells. Many mechanisms revealed, including growth factors, oncogenes, mutations, contributing suppression mitochondria, similar takes place hypoxia. suppression leads inhibition mitochondria-driven apoptosis, promotes proliferation, enhances angiogenesis metastatic potential. number molecular tools small molecules targeting metabolic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, developed, inhibiting cancer growth vitro vivo several cancer types. Several already entered early-phase trials, great translational success considering young age field (less 10 years). review mechanisms effects metabolic modulators rationale development. rapidly accumulating knowledge allows optimism may prove paradigm shift way understand treat cancer.
