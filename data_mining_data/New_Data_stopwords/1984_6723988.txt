 Previous evidence shown M1 L pyruvate kinase isozymes differ markedly kinetic immunological properties, amino acid compositions peptide maps. However, amino acid sequence results present N-terminal region region C domain show M1 L isozymes similar. variable length N-terminal sequences also explains difference regulation phosphorylation M1 L isozymes. M1 isozyme lacks serine residue shown phosphorylated L isozyme.
