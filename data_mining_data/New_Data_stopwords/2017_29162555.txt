 Chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels impair cognition pro-inflammatory brain. Deficiency inhibition 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 (11beta-HSD1), converts inactive active glucocorticoids, protects glucocorticoid-associated chronic stress- age-related cognitive impairment. Here, hypothesised 11beta-HSD1 deficiency attenuates brain cytokine response inflammation. inflammation associated altered energy metabolism, also examined effects 11beta-HSD1 deficiency upon hippocampal energy metabolism. Inflammation induced 11beta-HSD1 deficient (Hsd11b1(Del/Del)) C57BL/6 control mice intraperitoneal injection lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS reduced circulating neutrophil monocyte numbers increased plasma corticosterone levels equally C57BL/6 Hsd11b1(Del/Del) mice, suggesting similar peripheral inflammatory response. However, induction pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs hippocampus attenuated Hsd11b1(Del/Del) mice. Principal component analysis mRNA expression revealed distinct metabolic response LPS hippocampus Hsd11b1(Del/Del) mice. Expression Pfkfb3 Ldha, key contributors Warburg effect, showed greater induction Hsd11b1(Del/Del) mice. Consistent increased glycolytic flux, levels 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dihydroxyacetone phosphate reduced hippocampus LPS injected Hsd11b1(Del/Del) mice. Expression Sdha Sdhb, encoding subunits succinate dehydrogenase/complex II determines mitochondrial reserve respiratory capacity, induced specifically hippocampus LPS injected Hsd11b1(Del/Del) mice, together increased levels product, fumarate. data suggest 11beta-HSD1 deficiency attenuates hippocampal pro-inflammatory response LPS, associated increased capacity aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial ATP generation. may provide better metabolic support neuroprotective systemic inflammation aging.
