 Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) pyruvate kinase (PK) activities studied hemoglobin H (HbH) patients spectrophotometric method, cytochemical method methemoglobin reduction (MR) test detection heterozygous G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency found 7 64 cases (10.9%), including 3 cases genotype alpha 1/alpha 2 4 cases genotype alpha 1/CS. None HbH patients found PK-deficient. Spectrophotometrically determined G6PD PK activities significantly higher HbH patients normals (p less 0.001), whereas MR test yielded significantly lower percentage residual methemoglobin HbH patients normals (p less 0.05). three methods efficient detection hemizygous G6PD deficiency HbH patients, G6PD-deficient females.
