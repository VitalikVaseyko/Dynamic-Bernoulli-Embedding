 Congenital nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia (HA) dogs Basenji breed inherited simple, autosomal recessive trait. Previous results pyruvate kinase (PK) assays suggest causal relationship anaemia PK deficiency erythrocytes. present investigation assays enzyme performed haemolysates 45 Basenji dogs, comprising 3 anaemic 42 non-anaemic individuals 13 known heterozygotes. PK activity haemolysates 42 non-anaemic dogs exhibited bimodal distribution corresponding genotypic classes: heterozygotes normal homozygotes. results indicate heterozygotes partial, detectable enzyme deficiency, reflected clinical disease, thus give evidence gene dosage effect agreement observations man. proposed genotypes PK PK, PK pk pk pk refer normal homozygotes, heterozygotes, anaemic individuals, respectively. findings strengthen genetic hypothesis recessiveness anaemia direct detection heterozygosity parents affected individuals. Moreover, results value comparative studies practical application connection eradication programmes.
