 Aggressive cancers exhibit efficient conversion high amounts glucose lactate accompanied acid secretion, phenomenon popularly known Warburg effect. acidic microenvironment alkaline cytosol create proton-gradient (acid gradient) across plasma membrane represents proton-motive energy. Increasing experimental data physiological relevant models suggest acid gradient stimulates tumor proliferation, also support energy needs. However, direct biochemical evidence linking extracellular acid gradient generation intracellular ATP missing. work, demonstrate cancer cells synthesize significant amounts phosphate-bonds phosphate response acid gradient across plasma membrane. noted phenomenon exists absence glycolysis mitochondrial ATP synthesis, unique cancer. Biochemical assays using viable cancer cells, purified plasma membrane vesicles utilizing radioactive phosphate, confirmed phosphate-bond synthesis free phosphate (Pi), also localization activity plasma membrane. addition ATP, predominant formation pyrophosphate (PPi) Pi also observed plasma membrane vesicles cancer cells subjected trans-membrane acid gradient. Cancer cytosols found capable converting PPi ATP, also stimulate ATP synthesis Pi vesicles. Acid gradient created glucose metabolism cancer cells, observed tumors, also proved critical phosphate-bond synthesis. brief, observations reveal role acidic tumor milieu potential energy source may offer novel therapeutic target.
