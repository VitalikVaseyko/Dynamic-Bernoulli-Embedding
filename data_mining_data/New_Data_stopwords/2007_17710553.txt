 Pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) key enzyme essential glycolytic pathway common perilous parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Inhibiting function enzyme could control wide spread intestinal infections caused Entamoeba histolytica humans. objective, modeled three dimensional structure PPDK protein. used templates 51% identity 67% similarity employ homology-modeling approach. Stereo chemical quality protein structure validated protein structure validation program PROCHECK VERIFY3D. Experimental proof available literature along silico studies indicated Lys21, Arg91, Asp323, Glu325 Gln337 probable active sites target protein. Virtual screening carried using genetic docking algorithm GOLD consensus scoring function X-Score substantiate prediction. small molecule libraries (ChemDivision database, Diversity dataset, Kinase inhibitor database) used screening process. Along high scoring results, interaction studies provided promising ligands future experimental screening inhibit function PPDK Entamoeba histolytica. Further, phylogeny study carried assess possibility using proposed ligands inhibitors related pathogens.
