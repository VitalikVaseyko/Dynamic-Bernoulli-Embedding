 High grade glioma (glioblastoma) common brain tumor. malignancy makes fourth biggest cause cancer death. experiments used several glioblastoma cell lines generated laboratory obtain proteomics information specific disease. study starts developing complete 2DE map glioblastoma proteins. 2DE separation following imaging, immunochemistry, spot picking, mass-spectrometry allowed us detecting identifying 100 proteins. Several prominent differences level norm cancer. Among alpha-enolase (ENOA_HUMAN), pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (KPYM_HUMAN), cofilin 1 (COF1_HUMAN), translationally-controlled tumor protein TCTP_HUMAN, annexin 1 (ANXA1_HUMAN), PCNA (PCNA_HUMAN), p53 (TP53_HUMAN) others. interesting results obtained protein p53. glioblastoma cell lines, level dramatically regulated enriched multiple additional isoforms. distribution well correlated presence proteins inside cells themselves. initial step suggest panel specific brain tumor markers (signature) help creating noninvasive techniques diagnose disease. preliminary data point proteins promising markers glioblastoma.
