 thirty-year lag, serendipitously reestablished contact patient glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency hydrops fetalis first reported 1987. provide clinical update provide results mutation analysis patient, Southern India. patient adult female 36 years age moderate anemia requires transfusions except intercurrent illnesses. Exome sequencing studies showed homozygous c.1018C>T (Pro340Ser) mutation exon 12 glucose phosphate isomerase gene later confirmed direct sequencing. mutation previously described. knowledge, also first known homozygous mutation hydrophobic core protein highly deleterious mutation silico analysis clinical history family. Flow cytometry studies band 3 content eosin maleimide showed unique tail red cells histograms, reflecting dense red cells (presumably ATP depleted) seen blood smears; similar findings seen patients pyruvate kinase phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency.
