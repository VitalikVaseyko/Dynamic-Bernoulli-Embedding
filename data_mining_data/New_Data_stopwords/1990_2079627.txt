 Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate kinase gene (PYK1) transformed yeast using multicopy vector pJDB207. Growth rates PYK1 gene expression levels varied considerably amongst transformants. Yeast transformants expressing PYK1 gene high levels formed small colonies compared expressing gene relatively low levels. Slow-growing transformants 'reverted' high frequency rapid growth, correlated decreases PYK1 gene copy number PYK1 mRNA abundance. apparent selection PYK1 over-expression disrupted introduction stop codon 5'-end PYK1 coding region, thus confirming growth effects mediated PYK1 gene. However, massive overproduction pyruvate kinase yeast, using multiple copies PGK:PYK gene fusion, significant effect upon cell growth. suggests deleterious effect upon host yeast cell mediated abnormally high levels wild-type gene PYK1 mRNA, rather increased pyruvate kinase levels.
