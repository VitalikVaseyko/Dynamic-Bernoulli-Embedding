 key enzyme glycolysis (pyruvate kinase) main enzymes electron transport system (NADH cytochrome c reductase, succinic cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase) measured left ventricular biopsy specimens six hypertrophic (HCM) six congestive (CCM) cardiomyopathy. Pyruvate kinase 104.0 45.0 mU/mg protein HCM CCM, respectively. NADH cytochrome c reductase, succinic cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase 146.0, 9.9, 775.0 mU/mg protein HCM 87.4, 5.2, 502.0 mU/mg protein CCM, respectively. data, evident glycolysis enzyme activities electron transport system increased HCM decreased CCM. Cardiac function reflects state energy metabolism pathways myocardium. changing energy metabolism right ventricle emphysema hamster seems support concept.
