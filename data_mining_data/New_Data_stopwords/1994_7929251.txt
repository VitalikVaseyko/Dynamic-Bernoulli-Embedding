 Metabolic control analyses glucose utilization performed four groups working rat hearts perfused Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 10 mM glucose only, addition 4 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate/1 mM acetoacetate, 100 nM insulin (0.05 unit/ml), both. Net glycogen breakdown occurred glucose group converted net glycogen synthesis presence additions. flux [2-3H]glucose P-glucoisomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) reduced ketones, elevated insulin, unchanged combination. Net glycolytic flux reduced presence ketones combination. flux control coefficients determined portion pathway involving glucose transport branches glycogen synthesis glycolysis. Major control divided glucose transporter hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) glucose group. distribution control slightly shifted hexokinase ketones, control glucose transport step abolished presence insulin. Analysis pathway 3-P-glycerate pyruvate determined major control shared enolase (EC 4.2.1.1) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) glucose group. Addition ketones, insulin, combination shifted control P-glycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.1) pyruvate kinase. results illustrate control metabolic flux glucose metabolism rat heart exerted single enzyme variably distributed among enzymes depending upon substrate availability, hormonal stimulation, changes conditions.
