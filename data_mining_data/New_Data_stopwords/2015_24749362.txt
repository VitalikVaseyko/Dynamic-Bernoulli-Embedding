 OBJECTIVE: construct human protein kinase B (ATK2), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) bcl-2-associated death protein (BAD) lentiviral expression vector, determine expressions 293T cells. METHODS: Total RNA extracted lung cancer tissues. full-length coding regions human ATK2, BAD PDK1 cDNA amplified via RT-PCR using specific primers, subcloned PGEM-Teasy sequenced confirmation. full-length coding sequence cut specific restriction enzyme digest subclone pCDF1-MCS2-EF1-copGFP. plasmids transfected 293T cells using calcium phosphate method. expression AKT2, BAD PDK1 detected Western blot. RESULTS: AKT2, PDK1 BAD subcloned pCDF1-MCS2-EF1-copGFP, efficiency transfection 100%, 95%, 90% respectively. virus titers 6.7 x 10(6) PFU/mL supernatant. infection, proteins AKT2, PDK1 BAD detected Western blot. CONCLUSION: lentivial vector pCDF1-MCS2-EF1-copGFP containing AKT2, BAD PDK1 successfully constructed expressed 293T cells.
