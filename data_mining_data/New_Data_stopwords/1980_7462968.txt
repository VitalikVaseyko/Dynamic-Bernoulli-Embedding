 Despite marked changes crustacean muscle undergoes molt cycle, pyruvate kinase present form throughout molt cycle. pyruvate kinase subject feed-forward activation fructose-1, 6 bisphosphate (FBP) well feed-back inhibition MgATP. enzyme showed high affinity phosphoenolpyruvate (Km = 0.1 mM) showed cooperativity substrate binding. addition 0.05 mM FBP reduced PEP Km 0.05 mM. MgATP inhibition showed Ki 1.8 mM versus PEP. inhibition due MgATP could reversed FBP. Various compounds inhibited enzyme, including citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, tryptophan, malate, although rather high levels. Measurements reversal pyruvate kinase, taken together low levels phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate carboxylase, predict minimal levels gluconeogenic flux crustacean muscle.
