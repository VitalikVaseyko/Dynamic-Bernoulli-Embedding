 Hexokinase II enzyme central glucose metabolism glucose repression yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion HXK2, gene encodes hexokinase II, dramatically changed physiology S. cerevisiae. hxk2-null mutant strain displayed fully oxidative growth high glucose concentrations early exponential batch cultures, resulting initial absence fermentative products ethanol, postponed shortened diauxic shift, higher biomass yields. Several intracellular changes associated deletion hexokinase II. hxk2 mutant higher mitochondrial H(+)-ATPase activity lower pyruvate decarboxylase activity, coincided intracellular accumulation pyruvate hxk2 mutant. concentrations adenine nucleotides, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate comparable wild type hxk2 mutant. contrast, concentration fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, allosteric activator pyruvate kinase, clearly lower hxk2 mutant wild type. results suggest redirection carbon flux hxk2 mutant production biomass consequence reduced glucose repression.
