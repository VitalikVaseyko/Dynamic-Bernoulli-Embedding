 Muscles sampled vascularly isolated autoperfused dog gracilis fast freezing techniques 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 180 initiation twitch contractions 4 Hz analyzed phosphocreatine, creatine, ATP, lactate, pyruvate, 3-phosphoglycerate, dihydroxyacetonephosphate contents. Metabolite concentrations used equilibrium constants triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase estimate cytosolic pH changes rest-to-work transition. Magnesium hydrogen binding taken account. Limits approach include errors intermediate measurements uncertainties values equilibrium constants. former leads maximum errors +/- 0.15 pH units, whereas latter affects absolute pH value estimates changes pH. estimated pH increases resting value 7.05 approximately 7.8 5 stimulation falls pH value approximately 6.5 3 min stimulation. results consistent previous studies permit identification larger early alkaline shift. Potential causes pH changes discussed.
