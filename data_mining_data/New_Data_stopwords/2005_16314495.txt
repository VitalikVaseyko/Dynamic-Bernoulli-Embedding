 transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha key regulator energy metabolism, yet little known role control substrate selection. found physiological stimuli known induce PGC-1alpha expression skeletal muscle coordinately upregulate expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), negative regulator glucose oxidation. Forced expression PGC-1alpha C(2)C(12) myotubes induced PDK4 mRNA protein expression. PGC-1alpha-mediated activation PDK4 expression shown occur transcriptional level mapped putative nuclear receptor binding site. Gel shift assays demonstrated PGC-1alpha-responsive element bound estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha), recently identified component PGC-1alpha signaling pathway. addition, PGC-1alpha shown activate ERRalpha expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed PGC-1alpha ERRalpha occupied mPDK4 promoter C(2)C(12) myotubes. Additionally, transfection studies using ERRalpha-null primary fibroblasts demonstrated ERRalpha required PGC-1alpha-mediated activation mPDK4 promoter. predicted effects PGC-1alpha PDK4 gene transcription, overexpression PGC-1alpha C(2)C(12) myotubes decreased glucose oxidation rates. results identify PDK4 gene new PGC-1alpha/ERRalpha target suggest mechanism whereby PGC-1alpha exerts reciprocal inhibitory influences glucose catabolism increasing alternate mitochondrial oxidative pathways skeletal muscle.
