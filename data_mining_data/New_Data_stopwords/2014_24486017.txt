 Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) crucial glucose homeostasis mammalian cells. current understanding PDC regulation involves inhibitory serine phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) PDH kinase (PDK), whereas dephosphorylation PDH PDH phosphatase (PDP) activates PDC. Here, report lysine acetylation PDHA1 PDP1 common epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells diverse human cancer cells. K321 acetylation inhibits PDHA1 recruiting PDK1, K202 acetylation inhibits PDP1 dissociating substrate PDHA1, important promoting glycolysis cancer cells consequent tumor growth. Moreover, identified mitochondrial ACAT1 SIRT3 upstream acetyltransferase deacetylase, respectively, PDHA1 PDP1, knockdown ACAT1 attenuates tumor growth. Furthermore, Y381 phosphorylation PDP1 dissociates SIRT3 recruits ACAT1 PDC. Together, hierarchical, distinct posttranslational modifications act concert control molecular composition PDC contribute Warburg effect.
