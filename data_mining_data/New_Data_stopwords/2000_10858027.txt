 study designed determine level inhibition gene transcription reduction insulin levels upon onset diabetes spontaneously diabetic B/B rats reducing level polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) diet increase lipogenic enzyme activity. Control (eight animals per group) spontaneously diabetic B/B male weanling rats (25 animals per group) fed semipurified diets containing 20% (w/w) fat either low (0.25) high (1.0) polyunsaturated saturated (P/S) fatty acid ratio. Rats killed onset diabetes [blood glucose level approximately/= 100 mg/dL (5.55 mM)] became highly diabetic [blood glucose level approximately/= 400 mg/dL (22.22 mM)]. Total RNA extracted liver, relative amount mRNA coding fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, malic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase determined. Liver enzyme activities also measured. mRNA levels FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, malic enzyme decreased compared control animals. mRNA level pyruvate kinase decreased onset diabetes compared control animals. Feeding animals low P/S diet treatment elevated level mRNA lipogenic enzyme activity compared animals fed high P/S diet treatment, suggesting effect PUFA lipogenic enzymes direct effect gene expression.
