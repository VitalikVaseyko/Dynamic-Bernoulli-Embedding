 BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism increases heart rate, contractility, cardiac output, metabolic rate. also accompanied alterations regulation cardiac substrate use. Specifically, hyperthyroidism increases ex vivo activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, thereby inhibiting glucose oxidation via pyruvate dehydrogenase. Cardiac hypertrophy another effect hyperthyroidism, increase abundance mitochondria. Although hypertrophy initially beneficial, eventually lead heart failure. aim study use hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigate rate regulation vivo pyruvate dehydrogenase flux hyperthyroid heart establish whether modulation flux pyruvate dehydrogenase would alter cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS RESULTS: Hyperthyroidism induced 18 male Wistar rats 7 daily intraperitoneal injections freshly prepared triiodothyronine (0.2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). vivo pyruvate dehydrogenase flux, assessed hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy, reduced 59% hyperthyroid animals (0.0022 +/- 0.0002 versus 0.0055 +/- 0.0005 second(-1); P=0.0003), reduction completely reversed short- long-term delivery dichloroacetic acid, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor. Hyperpolarized [2-(13)C]pyruvate also used evaluate Krebs cycle metabolism demonstrated unique marker anaplerosis, level significantly increased hyperthyroid heart. Cine magnetic resonance imaging showed long-term dichloroacetic acid treatment significantly reduced hypertrophy observed hyperthyroid animals (100 +/- 20 versus 200 +/- 30 mg; P=0.04) despite change increase observed cardiac output. CONCLUSIONS: work demonstrated inhibition glucose oxidation hyperthyroid heart vivo mediated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Relieving inhibition increase metabolic flexibility hyperthyroid heart reduce level hypertrophy develops maintaining increased cardiac output required meet higher systemic metabolic demand.
