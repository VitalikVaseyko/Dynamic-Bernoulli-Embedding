 Glioblastomas characterized amplification EGFR. Approximately half tumors EGFR over-expression also express constitutively active ligand independent EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII). current treatments emphasize surgery followed radiation chemotherapy Temozolomide (TMZ), acquired chemoresistance universal feature recurrent GBMs. mimic GBM resistant state, generated vitro TMZ resistant model demonstrated dichloroacetate (DCA), metabolic inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), reverses Warburg effect. Microarray analysis conducted TMZ resistant cells subsequent treatment DCA revealed PDK1 sole target. DCA treatment also induced mitochondrial membrane potential change apoptosis evidenced JC-1 staining electron microscopic studies. Computational homology modeling docking studies confirmed DCA binding EGFR, EGFRvIII PDK1 high affinity. addition, expression EGFRvIII comparable PDK1 compared EGFR GBM surgical specimens supporting silico prediction data. Collectively current study provides first vitro proof concept DCA reverses Warburg effect setting EGFRvIII positivity TMZ resistance leading GBM cytotoxicity, implicating cellular tyrosine kinase signaling cancer cell metabolism.
