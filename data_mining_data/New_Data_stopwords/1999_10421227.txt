 studied effects exercise training activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex rat gastrocnemius muscle (experiment 1) response complex glucose insulin infusion (euglycemic clamp) trained sedentary rats (experiment 2). experiment 1, half rats randomly allocated sedentary animals half trained voluntary running exercise 8 weeks. total activity PDH complex affected exercise training, activity state (proportion active form) PDH complex decreased 15.0%+/-2.4% 7.5%+/-1.1% exercise training. activity 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme (CoA) dehydrogenase ([3-HADH] enzyme beta-oxidation) significantly higher trained versus sedentary rats. experiment 2, sedentary trained rats starved 24 hours performing euglycemic clamp. Glucose insulin infusion performed euglycemic clamp (insulin infusion rate, 6 mU/kg/min) 90 minutes. PDH complex inactivated less 1% sedentary trained rats 24 hours starvation. glucose infusion rate (GIR) euglycemic clamp higher trained versus sedentary rats. euglycemic clamp resulted activation PDH complex sedentary trained rats, response PDH complex euglycemic clamp significantly higher trained rats (5.8%+/-0.5%) sedentary rats (2.9%+/-0.5%). results suggest exercise training promotes fatty acid oxidation association suppression glucose oxidation skeletal muscle resting conditions, increases rate carbohydrate oxidation glucose flux muscle cells stimulated insulin.
