 paper reports study reaction phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP Mg(2+) catalysed pig liver pyruvate kinase activated fructose diphosphate K(+). experimental results consistent two non-sequential mechanisms substrates products reaction phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, Mg(2+), pyruvate MgATP. Pyruvate release occurs ADP binding. Two Mg(2+) ions involved, though two Mg(2+)-binding sites cannot occupied simultaneously. isomerized enzyme complex forms release MgATP. Values determined Michaelis constants reaction. Apparent MgATP inhibition constants also given.
