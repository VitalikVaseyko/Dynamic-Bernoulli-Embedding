 Pyruvate kinase-(PK) deficient human reticulocytes incubated 4 hr conditions mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibited become ATP-depleted. Concomitantly, energy-depleted red blood cells (RBC) lose massive amounts potassium water. PK-deficient reticulocyte-rich RBC Basenji dog, incubated conditions, also manifest ATP-depletion K-loss. contrast cation changes human cells, however, K-loss PK-deficient dog reticulocyte-rich RBC balanced equivalent Na gain, consequently canine erythrocytes undergo change cellular hydration. Potassium depletion dehydration, may related membrane injury human RBC, appear involved hemolysis PK-deficient dog erythrocytes.
