 metabolic fluxes central carbon pathways bioprocess serine alkaline protease (SAP) production Bacillus licheniformis calculated metabolic flux-based stoichiometric model based proposed metabolic network contains 102 metabolites 133 reaction fluxes using time profiles citrate, dry cell, organic acids, amino acids, SAP constraints. model solved minimizing SAP accumulation rate cell. effects oxygen-transfer rate (OTR) metabolic fluxes investigated defined medium citrate used sole carbon source. central pathways active growth SAP synthesis periods bioprocess low (LOT), medium (MOT), high (HOT) oxygen-transfer conditions. flux partitioning TCA cycle alpha-ketoglutarate towards glutamate group oxalacetate (OA) toward aspartic acid group amino acids dependent OTR. flux anaplerotic reaction connects TCA cycle either malate OA gluconeogenesis pathway via main branch point pyruvate (Pyr) also influenced OTR. decrease OTR, intracellular flux values glycerate 3-phosphate (PG3) gluconeogenesis pathway specific growth rate decreased. total ATP-generation rate increased increase OTR. pathway towards aspartic acid family amino acids important sporulation precedes SAP synthesis active throughout bioprocess. Metabolic flux analysis results LOT, MOT, HOT conditions encourage design oxygen-transfer strategy bioreactor; moreover, asparagine synthetase aspartate kinase could potential metabolic engineering sites due low value flux branch point aspartate toward asparagine.
