 Sensitive detection extracellular lactate concentrations single cell level importance studying metabolic alterations tumor progression. unique nanoscale optical fiber lactate sensor developed monitor extracellular lactate concentrations cancer cells immobilizing nanotip lactate dehydrogenases, could catalyze lactate conversion generate NADH sensitive fluorescence detection. results demonstrate fabricated nanosensor successfully detect extracellular lactate concentrations single HeLa, MCF-7, human fetal osteoblast (hFOB) cells, showing cancer cells distinctly higher extracellular lactate concentrations normal cells predicted Warburg effect. nanosensor also employed investigate effect monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor lactate efflux cancer cells. Different lactate efflux inhibition profiles obtained HeLa MCF-7 cell lines. work demonstrates nanosensor potential evaluating effect metabolic agents cancer metabolism survival.
