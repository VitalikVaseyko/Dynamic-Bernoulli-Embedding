 mammals, glucose-regulated gene expression best characterized liver, increased glucose metabolism induces transcription genes encoding enzymes involved de novo lipogenesis. ChREBP Mlx dimerize function together glucose-responsive transcription factor regulate target genes, liver-type pyruvate kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, fatty acid synthase. identify additional glucose-responsive genes liver, used microarray analysis compare gene expression patterns low high glucose conditions hepatocytes. Target genes ChREBP.Mlx simultaneously identified gene profiling presence absence dominant negative Mlx. 224 genes induced glucose, 139 genes (62%) also inhibited dominant negative Mlx. Lipogenic enzyme genes involved entire pathway de novo lipogenesis found glucose-responsive target genes ChREBP.Mlx. Genes encoding enzymes metabolic pathways numerous regulators metabolism also identified. determine genes direct targets ChREBP.Mlx, searched ChoRE-like sequences 5'-flanking regions several genes responded rapidly glucose. ChoRE sequences bound ChREBP.Mlx supported glucose response identified two additional genes. Combining known ChoRE sequences, generated modified ChoRE consensus sequence, CAYGNGN(5)CNCRTG. summary, ChREBP.Mlx principal transcription factor regulating glucose-responsive genes liver coordinately regulates family genes required glucose utilization energy storage.
