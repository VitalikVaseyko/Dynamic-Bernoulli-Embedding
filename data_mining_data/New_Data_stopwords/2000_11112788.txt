 Transcription number genes involved lipogenesis stimulated dietary carbohydrate mammalian liver. insulin increased glucose metabolism proposed initiating signals process, pathways effectors act alter transcription resolved. previously defined electrophoretic mobility shift assay factor nuclear extracts rat liver, designated carbohydrate-responsive factor (Cho- RF), binds liver-type pyruvate kinase S(14) promoters sites critical regulation carbohydrate. sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) also emerged major transcription factor involved nutritional response. study, examined relationship SREBP-1c ChoRF lipogenic gene induction. two factors found possess distinct DNA binding specificities vitro hepatocytes. Reporter constructs containing binding sites ChoRF responsive glucose directly insulin. hand, reporter constructs SREBP-1c site responded directly insulin. S(14) gene possesses binding sites ChoRF SREBP, sites found functionally important response promoter glucose insulin hepatocytes. Consequently, propose SREBP-1c ChoRF independent transcription factors mediate signals generated insulin glucose, respectively. many lipogenic enzyme genes, two factors may provide integrated signaling system support overall nutritional response dietary carbohydrate.
