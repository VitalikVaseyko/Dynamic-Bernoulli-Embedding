 Maple syrup urine disease autosomal metabolic disease caused deficiency branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex activity. disease occur accumulation branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, valine corresponding branched-chain alpha-keto acids tissues body fluids. affected patients may present psychomotor development delay mental retardation. pathophysiology maple syrup urine disease entirely understood, leucine seems primary neurotoxic metabolite. Creatine pyruvate energetics antioxidants substances. study, investigated effects leucine administration co-administration creatine plus pyruvate several parameters oxidative stress phosphoryl transfer network cerebral cortex hippocampus Wistar rats treated 8th 21st postpartum day. Leucine induced oxidative stress diminished activities pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, cytosolic mitochondrial creatine kinase. Co-administration creatine plus pyruvate prevented alterations provoked leucine administration oxidative stress enzymes phosphoryltransfer network. results indicate chronic administration leucine may stimulate oxidative stress alters enzymes phosphoryltransfer network cerebral cortex hippocampus rats. possible effects may contribute, along mechanisms, neurological dysfunction found patients affected maple syrup urine disease. case, possible creatine plus pyruvate supplementation could benefit patients.
