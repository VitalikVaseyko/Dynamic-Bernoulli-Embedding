 AIMS: effect ethanol glucose synthesis kidney-cortex tubules control diabetic rabbits investigated. METHODS: freshly isolated grown primary cultures, kidney-cortex tubules incubated alanine aspartate plus lactate glycerol plus octanoate absence presence 100 mmol/l ethanol. RESULTS: freshly isolated renal tubules incubated presence alanine plus lactate glycerol plus octanoate, tubules grown primary culture medium containing alanine plus lactate plus octanoate alcohol, resulted 30% decrease glucose formation. diminished glucose production freshly isolated tubules accompanied by: (i) decrease alanine utilization, (ii) increase lactate glycerol consumptions (iii) decline GSH:GSSG ratio. ethanol action abolished 4-methylpyrazole, inhibitor alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). view ethanol-induced changes gluconeogenic intermediates likely presence alanine plus glycerol plus octanoate ethanol causes decline flux phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, probably due either increase intracellular content 2-oxoglutarate, inhibitor key gluconeogenic enzyme and/or enhanced flux pyruvate kinase, concluded increased lactate formation presence glycerol incubation medium. renal tubules grown primary cultures presence alanine plus lactate plus octanoate decrease GSH:GSSG ratio accompanied elevated generation reactive oxygen species (ROS). Upon replacement alanine aspartate ethanol affected neither glucose production, substrate uptake, ROS accumulation GSH:GSSG ratio. CONCLUSIONS: presence alanine ethanol-induced decrease glucose production elevation ROS might cause limited NADPH generation resulting decrease intracellular GSH:GSSG ratio. contrary, aspartate might protect ROS generation, intensive gluconeogenesis supports NADPH generation consequence high values intracellular GSH:GSSG ratio maintained.
