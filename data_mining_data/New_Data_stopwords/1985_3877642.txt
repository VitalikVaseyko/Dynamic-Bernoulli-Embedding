 LDHk cancer-associated lactate dehydrogenase also found high levels normal mammalian retina. retinas share cancer tissues dependence aerobic glycolysis, leading high production lactate. However, retinas lower vertebrate species significantly less dependent aerobic glycolysis. find retinas species less dependent aerobic glycolysis express significantly lower levels LDHk-like activity, less equal low levels seen brains. enzymes lower species differ mammalian retinal enzyme pH optima responsiveness oxygen; share similar degree inhibition 5'-5'-dinucleoside tetraphosphates. Therefore, expression pattern LDHk brain retina diverse vertebrate species suggests link Warburg effect.
