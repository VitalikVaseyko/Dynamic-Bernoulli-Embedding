 incorporation glycerol lipid measured using SV40 transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) either wild-type (WT) mice mice epsilon isoform diacylglycerol kinase (DGKepsilon) knocked (DGKepsilon(-/-)). present explanation finding DGKepsilon(-/-) MEFs exhibited greater uptake (3)H-glycerol cell greater incorporation lipids compared WT counterparts, change relative amounts various lipids DGKepsilon(-/-) WT MEFs. Glycerol kinase highly expressed DGKepsilon(-/-) cells WT counterparts. addition, activity glycerol kinase greater DGKepsilon(-/-) cells WT counterparts. substrates enter cell independent glycerol kinase, pyruvate acetate, incorporated lipid extent DGKepsilon(-/-) WT cell lines. also show expression p53, transcription factor increases synthesis glycerol kinase, increased DGKepsilon(-/-) MEFs comparison WT cells. conclude increased incorporation glycerol lipids DGKepsilon(-/-) cells consequence up-regulation glycerol kinase result increase rate lipid synthesis. Furthermore, increased expression pro-survival gene, p53, cells knocked DGKepsilon suggests cells over-expressing DGKepsilon would greater propensity become tumorigenic.
