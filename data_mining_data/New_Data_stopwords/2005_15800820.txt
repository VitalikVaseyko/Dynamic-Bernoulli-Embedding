 BACKGROUND OBJECTIVE: Colonoscopy gold standard diagnosis colonic neoplasia. low compliance, discomfort bowel preparation procedure (albeit small) risk perforation bleeding alternative procedures stool tests focused on. PATIENTS METHODS: informed consent stool samples 116 patients (44 male, 72 female, median age 47 years), scheduled colonoscopy 22 patients (17 m, 5 f, 69 y) known colorectal cancer stool samples collected. samples investigated three methods: biochemical (Guajak) test fecal occult blood, immunological test fecal occult blood test determining dimer pyruvat kinase M2 (tumor M2-PK). RESULTS: Sensitivity detection colorectal cancer polyps 27 % 10 % biochemical test, 91 % 19 % immunological test 77 % 48 % M2-PK-test, respectively. Specificity 89 %, 94 % 72 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: methods detection occult blood similar specificity. sensitivity immunological test detection colorectal cancer significantly higher. M2-PK-test markedly lower specificity diagnosing cancer. low sensitivity polyps usefulness stool tests questionable. Reducing incidence mortality colorectal cancer achieved colonoscopy, recommendation requires specific communication public.
