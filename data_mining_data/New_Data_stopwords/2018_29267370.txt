 Limited research data published H+ coefficients metabolites reactions involved non-mitochondrial energy metabolism. purpose investigation compute fractional binding H+, K+, Na+ Mg2+ 21 metabolites skeletal muscle non-mitochondrial energy metabolism, resulting 104 different metabolite-cation complexes. Fractional binding H+ metabolite-cation complexes applied 17 reactions skeletal muscle non-mitochondrial energy metabolism, 8 conditions glycolytic pathway based source substrate (glycogen vs. glucose), completeness glycolytic flux, end-point pyruvate vs. lactate. pH conditions 6.0 7.0, respectively, H+ coefficients (-'ve values = H+ release) creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, AMP deaminase ATPase reactions 0.8 0.97, -0.13 -0.02, 1.2 1.09, -0.01 -0.66, respectively. glycolytic pathway net H+ releasing, regardless lactate production, consumes 1 H+. glycolysis fueled glycogen ending either pyruvate lactate, H+ coefficients pH 6.0 7.0 -3.97 -2.01 (pyruvate), -1.96 -0.01 (lactate), respectively. starting glucose, conditions result H+ coefficients -3.98 -2.67, -1.97 -0.67, respectively. H+ releasing reaction glycolysis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, H+ coefficients pH 6.0 7.0 -1.58 -0.76, respectively. Incomplete flux substrate glycolysis would increase net H+ release due absence pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase reactions, collectively result H+ coefficients pH 6.0 7.0 1.35 1.88, respectively. data presented provide extensive reference source academics researchers accurately profile balance protons metabolites reactions non-mitochondrial energy metabolism, reveal greater role glycolysis net H+ release previously assumed. data also used improve understanding cause metabolic acidosis, reveal mechanistic connections H+ release within muscle electrochemical neutrality concepts refine acid-base balance biological solutions.
