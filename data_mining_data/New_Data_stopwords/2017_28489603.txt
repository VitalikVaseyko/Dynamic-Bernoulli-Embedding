 Positron emission tomography (PET) 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) widely used management lung adenocarcinoma. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays key role glycolysis. therefore investigated whether PKM2 expression affects 18F-FDG uptake retrospective analysis 76 patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) scans staging surgical resection. found PKM2 expression higher tumors peritumoral tissue (p < 0.05). Patients high PKM2 expression reduced overall (p < 0.05) disease-free (p < 0.05) survival compared low PKM2 expression. Comparison primary tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) patients high low PKM2 expression revealed SUVmax higher primary tumors high PKM2 expression low PKM2 expression (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed association SUVmax PKM2 expression (p < 0.05). PKM2 status predicted 81.6% accuracy SUVmax cutoff value 6.4. Thus,18F-FDG PET/CT predictive PKM2 status lung adenocarcinoma patients could aid determining therapeutic strategies.
