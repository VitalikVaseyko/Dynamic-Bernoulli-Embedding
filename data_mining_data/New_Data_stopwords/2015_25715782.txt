 Artemisinin potent antimalarial drug; however, suffers unstable insufficient supply plant source. Here, established novel multivariate-modular approach based experimental design systematic pathway optimization succeeded improving production amorphadiene (AD), precursor artemisinin, Escherichia coli. initially found AD production limited imbalance glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) pyruvate (PYR), two precursors 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway. Furthermore, identified GAP PYR could balanced replacing phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) ATP-dependent galactose permease glucose kinase system (GGS) resulted fivefold increase AD titer (11 60 mg/L). Subsequently, experimental design-aided systematic pathway optimization (EDASPO) method applied systematically optimize transcriptional expressions eight critical genes glucose uptake DXP AD synthesis pathways. genes classified four modules simultaneously controlled T7 promoter variants. regression model generated using four-module experimental data predicted optimal expression ratios among modules, resulting another threefold increase AD titer (60 201 mg/L). EDASPO method may useful optimization pathways products beyond scope study.
