 Keratins 8 18 (K8 K18) heteropolymeric intermediate filament phosphoglycoproteins simple-type epithelia. Mutations K8 K18 predispose affected individual liver disease protect hepatocytes apoptosis. K18 undergoes dynamic O-linked N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation Ser 30, 31 49. investigated function K18 glycosylation generating mice overexpress human K18 S30/31/49A substitution mutants cannot glycosylated (K18-Gly(-)), compared susceptibility mice injury wild-type keratin-mutant mice. K18-Gly(-) mice susceptible liver pancreatic injury apoptosis induced streptozotocin liver injury combined N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase inhibition Fas administration. enhanced apoptosis livers mice express K18-Gly(-) involves inactivation Akt1 protein kinase Ctheta result site-specific hypophosphorylation. Akt1 binds K8, probably contributes reciprocal hyperglycosylation hypophosphorylation Akt1 occurs K18 hypoglycosylation, leads decreased Akt1 kinase activity. Therefore, K18 glycosylation provides unique protective role epithelial injury promoting phosphorylation activation cell-survival kinases.
