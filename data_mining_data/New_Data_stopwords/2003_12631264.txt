 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) subjected multiple interacting levels control plant cells. first level subcellular compartmentation. Plant cells unique two distinct, spatially separated forms PDC; mitochondrial (mtPDC) plastidial (plPDC). mtPDC site carbon entry tricarboxylic acid cycle, plPDC provides acetyl-CoA NADH de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. second level regulation PDC activity control gene expression. genes encoding subunits mt- plPDCs expressed following developmental programs, additionally subject physiological environmental cues. Thirdly, mt- plPDCs sensitive product inhibition, and, potentially, metabolite effectors. Finally, two different forms complex regulated distinct organelle-specific mechanisms. Activity mtPDC regulated reversible phosphorylation catalyzed intrinsic kinase phosphatase components. additional level sensitivity provided metabolite control kinase activity. plPDC regulated reversible phosphorylation. Instead, activity controlled large extent physical environment exists plastid stroma.
