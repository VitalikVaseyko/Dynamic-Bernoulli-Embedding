 underlying anticancer effects butyrate, end-product intestinal microbial fermentation dietary fiber, remain elusive. Here, report butyrate promotes cancer cell apoptosis acting SIRT3 inhibitor. Butyrate inhibits SIRT3 cultured cells vitro. Butyrate-induced PDHA1 hyperacetylation relieves inhibitory phosphorylation PDHA1 serine 293, thereby activating influx glycolytic intermediates tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reversing Warburg effect. Meanwhile, butyrate-induced hyperacetylation inactivates complex electron transfer chain prevents utilization TCA cycle intermediates. metabolic stresses promote apoptosis hyperglycolytic cancer cells, HCT116p53(-/-) cells. SIRT3 deacetylates PDHA1 complex I. Genetic ablation Sirt3 mouse hepatocytes abrogated ability butyrate induce apoptosis. results identify butyrate-mediated anti-tumor mechanism indicate combined activation PDC inhibition complex novel tumor treatment strategy.
