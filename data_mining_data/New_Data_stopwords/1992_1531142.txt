 kinetic influence bound creatine kinase (CK) Ca(2+)-activated myosin ATPase evaluated. ATPase rates measured 0.8 microM 3.2 mM MgATP. control conditions, apparent KmATP 79.9 +/- 13.3 microM. contrast, addition 12.2 mM phosphocreatine (PCr) decreased apparent KmATP value 13.6 +/- 1.4 microM. determine reduction merely result ATP maintenance system, ATP regenerated using either phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase (PEP-PK), PCr soluble bovine cardiac CK. Data obtained PEP + PK indicated apparent KmATP 65.5 +/- 7.3 microM. study effects exogenous CK, endogenous CK irreversibly inhibited 1 mM iodoacetamide. kinetics ATPase examined adding soluble CK incubation medium. conditions, KmATP 56.4 +/- 0.86 microM. Therefore, two ATP regeneration systems could duplicate effects endogenous CK. reduction apparent KmATP endogenous CK result altered inhibition MgADP. MgADP inhibition determined non-competitive, Ki 5.0 +/- 0.1 mM. data suggest observed kinetic effects reflect proximity enzymes myofibrillar bundle, thus emphasizing importance bound CK localized regeneration MgATP utilized myosin ATPase.
