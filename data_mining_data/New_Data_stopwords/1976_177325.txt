 Changes adenine nucleotide metabolism oral glucose load studied liver normal alloxan-diabetic rats. Changes energy charge positively correlated blood glucose plasma immunoreactive insulin levels. One hour oral glucose load plasma immunoreactive insulin levels increased maximally, energy charge increased maximally 0.846 0.867 (P less 0.001). increase energy charge accompanied concomitant decrease ADP levels (P less 0.05). respiratory control ration, state 3 respiration per unit cytochrome (+a3), DNP-induced ATPase activity per unit cytochrome (+a3) increased significantly. adenylate kinase pyruvate kinase activities liver remained unchanged. hand, energy charge liver alloxan-diabetic rats increase significantly oral glucose load. suggested increase energy charge liver attributable rapid flux intermediary metabolism enhanced ADP-phosphorylating reactions mitochondria, owing elevated level insulin available hepatic cells.
