 UNLABELLED: effect hypoglycemia contents glycolytic proteins, activities enzymes/transporters flux HeLa MCF-7 tumor cells experimentally analyzed modeled silico. 24 h hypoglycemia (2.5 mm initial glucose), significant increases protein levels glucose transporters 1 3 (GLUT 1 3) (3.4 2.1-fold, respectively) hexokinase (HKI) (2.3-fold) observed compared hyperglycemic standard cell culture condition (25 mm initial glucose). However, changes bring significant increase total activities (Vmax ) GLUT HK; instead, affinity proteins glucose increased, may explain twofold increased glycolytic flux hypoglycemia. Thus, increase catalytically efficient isoforms two main controlling steps sufficient induce increased flux. Further, previous kinetic model tumor glycolysis updated including ratios GLUT HK isoforms, modified pyruvate kinase kinetics oxidative phosphorylation reaction. updated model robust terms simulating metabolite levels fluxes cells exposed various glycemic conditions. Model simulations indicated main controlling steps glycogen degradation > HK > hexosephosphate isomerase hyper- normoglycemia, GLUT > HK > glycogen degradation hypoglycemia. predictions experimentally evaluated: glycolytic flux hypoglycemic cells sensitive cytochalasin B (a GLUT inhibitor) hyperglycemic cells. results indicated cancer glycolysis inhibited multiple controlling sites, regardless external glucose levels, effectively block pathway.
