 Delayed blastocysts activated injecting oestradiol-17 beta delayed implanting mice exposure culture medium lacking serum. Four enzymes carbohydrate metabolism (phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase) studied different time periods specific time-dependent changes found activation. characteristic feature marked decline 6 h activities phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Blastocyst activation vitro utero showed similar trends metabolic patterns 24-h period studied.
