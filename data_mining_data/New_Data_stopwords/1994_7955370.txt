 developed fully enzymatic method measure 1,5 anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG) serum use pyranose oxidase (PROD: EC 1.1.3.10), glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2), ATP-regenerating system. previous report (Clin Chem 1989;35:2039-43) glucose interfering measurement 1,5-AG removed minicolumn. method used here, glucokinase ATP-regenerating system efficiently convert glucose unreactive compound, glucose 6-phosphate, making method selective 1,5-AG. hydrogen peroxide produced oxidation 1,5-AG PROD detected standard enzymatic color-developing system. within-run day-to-day precision (CV) method 0.52-1.29% 1.17-4.48%, respectively. correlation (r) results obtained proposed method (y) obtained mini-column method (x) 0.998 (y = 1.007x + 0.493 mg/L; n = 100; Sy/x = 0.641 mg/L). newly developed method allows quicker easier measurement serum 1,5-AG previously described methods.
