 PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) plays central role maintenance glucose homoeostasis mammals. carbon flux PDC meticulously controlled elaborate mechanisms involving post-translational (short-term) phosphorylation/dephosphorylation transcriptional (long-term) controls. former regulatory mechanism involving multiple phosphorylation sites tissue-specific distribution dedicated kinases phosphatases dependent interactions among catalytic regulatory components complex also sensitive intramitochondrial redox state metabolite levels indicators energy status. Furthermore, differential transcriptional controls regulatory components PDC add complexity needed long-term tuning PDC activity maintenance glucose homoeostasis normal disease states.
