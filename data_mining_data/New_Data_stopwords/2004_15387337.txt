 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (Tu M2-PK) overexpressed tumor cells measured blood specific immunoenzymatic assay. objective investigate diagnostic value Tu M2-PK comparison CA 19-9 pancreatic cancer. studied 265 subjects: 60 histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer, 43 benign pancreatic diseases (acute chronic pancreatitis), 5 benign cystic neoplasms pancreas, 9 neuroendocrine tumors, 77 abdominal malignancies, 47 benign digestive diseases, 24 healthy controls. Levels plasma Tu M2-PK serum CA 19-9 determined commercially available specific immunoassays. diagnostic sensitivity specificity Tu M2-PK pancreatic cancer 85 41%, respectively, CA 19-9 75 81%. combination two tests significantly increased sensitivity (97%) lowered specificity (38%). discriminating pancreatic cancer acute chronic pancreatitis, Tu M2-PK turned less accurate CA 19-9. patients without pancreatic tumor, cholestasis appeared affect values Tu M2-PK, CA 19-9 found significantly higher. Tu M2-PK also abnormally high majority patients digestive malignancies neuroendocrine tumors. results demonstrate Tu M2-PK satisfactory sensitivity poor specificity diagnosis pancreatic cancer. Used together CA 19-9, sensitivity increases considerably.
