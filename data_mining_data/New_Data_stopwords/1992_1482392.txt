 present study examined effect vanadate activity key enzymes glycolysis level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2, 6-P2) hearts diabetic rats. 20% decrease total hexokinase activity 66% decrease type II isoenzyme found diabetic rat hearts. Vanadate treatment doubled activity type II hexokinase. Pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase 1 activity reduced 20% diabetes, vanadate treatment restored activity enzymes normal. 43% decrease cardiac F-2, 6-P2 level found diabetes four weeks duration. significant inverse correlation blood glucose experimental animals level heart F-2, 6-P2 observed. Vanadate treatment doubled amount F-2, 6-P2 diabetic rat hearts.
