 promoter yeast glycolytic gene encoding phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) contains upstream activation sequence bases -538 -402 upstream initiating ATG. upstream activation sequence contains multiple functional elements, including essential region called activator core (AC) sequence three copies pentamer 5'-CTTCC-3'. AC sequence shows strong homology consensus binding sites yeast proteins RAP1 (GRF1) TUF. demonstrated yeast protein interacts AC sequence DNA-binding protein RAP1. Expression PGK gene found regulated according carbon source growth medium. PGK mRNA levels high yeast cells grown glucose medium low yeast cells grown media containing carbon sources pyruvate acetate. carbon source regulation transcription found mediated, part, via regulation RAP1 binding AC sequence. promoters many yeast glycolytic genes also contain consensus RAP1-binding sites copies CTTCC pentamer. suggests RAP1 may involved transcriptional control many glycolytic genes addition PGK gene.
