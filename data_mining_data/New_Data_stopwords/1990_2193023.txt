 Previous studies shown dietary fructose stimulates expression L-type pyruvate kinase gene mainly post-transcriptional level diabetic liver, effect may mediated metabolite common fructose glycerol. present work, carried studies mechanism fructose induction L-type isozyme mRNA liver, kidney small intestine rats. L-type isozyme mRNA kidney normal diabetic rats increased dietary fructose, time course increase similar observed small intestine liver. mRNA induced kidney dietary glucose insulin. Glycerol also potent inducer mRNA kidney liver, small intestine. results show fructose glycerol induced increase mRNA organs metabolized, thus support metabolite hypothesis. carbohydrates tested increased level mRNA tissues, except glucose, increased level small intestine. Thus molecule increase mRNA level may accumulate significantly metabolism certain carbohydrates. Dietary fructose glycerol slightly stimulated transcription gene L-type isozyme diabetic liver, also normal diabetic kidney, magnitudes increase much lower mRNA, confirming previous findings described above. hand, dietary fructose caused marked stimulation gene transcription normal rat liver, although magnitude induction mRNA similar diabetic liver. Insulin treatment fructose-fed diabetic rats also caused marked increase gene transcription without concomitant change mRNA level. Thus, mechanism fructose induction L-type pyruvate kinase diabetic liver, similar found kidney, different normal liver, difference attributable difference level insulin.
