 importance metabolism cancer becoming increasingly apparent identification metabolic enzyme mutations growing awareness influence metabolism signaling, epigenetic markers, transcription. However, complexity processes challenged ability make sense metabolic changes cancer. Fortunately, constraint-based modeling, systems biology approach, enables one study entirety cancer metabolism simulate basic phenotypes. newness field, rapid evolution scope models applications. review various constraint-based models built cancer metabolism predictions shedding new light basic cancer phenotypes, elucidating pathway differences tumors, dicovering putative anti-cancer targets. field continues evolve, scope genome-scale cancer models must expand beyond central metabolism address questions related diverse processes contributing tumor development metastasis.
