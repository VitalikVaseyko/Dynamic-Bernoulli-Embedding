 question whether M1- M2-type isozymes pyruvate kinase synthesized common mRNA examined isolating total RNA rat skeletal muscle AH-130 Yoshida ascites hepatoma cells, express M1- M2-type isozymes, respectively, translating preparations rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. newly synthesized pyruvate kinase subunits compared sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing denaturing condition. pyruvate kinase subunit synthesized hepatoma cell RNA slightly larger molecular weight higher pI value subunit muscle RNA. mixture two RNAs added lysate, result obtained. Thus, concluded M1- M2-type isozymes translated different messenger RNAs.
