 erythrocytes liver patient hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia increased serum aminotransferases, almost complete deficiency L-type pyruvate kinase detected. parents patient second cousins pyruvate kinase activity erythrocytes decreased half normal values. Pyruvate kinase patient characterized extreme lability. Pyruvate kinase parents' red cells showed molecular abnormalities. cross-reactive material could precipitated monospecific antibody raised L-type pyruvate kinase patient's erythrocytes. red cells parents decreased amount cross-reactive material pyruvate kinase antibodies found, indicating lowered pyruvate kinase activity erythrocytes parents caused decreased level pyruvate kinase protein. liver patient L-type pyruvate kinase activity immunologically recognizable L-type pyruvate kinase could detected. increased lability enzyme protein may explain low residual activity. However, decreased activity shown sufficient perform normal glycolytic flux resulting moderate clinical expression.
