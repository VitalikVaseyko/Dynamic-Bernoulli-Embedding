 Chymotrypsin removed phosphorylated site porcine liver pyruvate kinase without inactivating enzyme. amino acid sequence phosphopeptide obtained analyzed. analysis CNBr fragments containing 33 amino acid residues, information obtained amino acid sequence around phosphorylated sites porcine rat liver pyruvate kinase. found (formula see text) porcine isozyme similar rat isozyme, although order five C-terminal amino acid residues (Leu, Pro, Ala2, Homoserine) fragment resolved Leu exchanged Val position 12 Arg Gln position 26. chymotryptic porcine isozyme phosphopeptide, composed 18 amino acid residues, entirely contained corresponding CNBr fragment (residues 7-24).
