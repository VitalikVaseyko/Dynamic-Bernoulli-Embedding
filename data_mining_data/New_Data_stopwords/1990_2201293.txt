 Immunological methods recommended protein visualization IEF account high sensitivity, good specificity resolution. used indirect immunoassay peroxidase- 125I-labelled antibodies investigate microheterogeneity pyruvate kinase (PK) human red blood cells could show PK pattern 10 single bands. Different methods tested applicability protein fixation subsequent immunological visualization polyacrylamide gel. Beside Western blot, immunofixation ethanolic fixation recommended fixation techniques especially isoelectric focusing ultrathin gels.
