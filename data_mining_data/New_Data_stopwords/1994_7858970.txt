 efficient technique presented integrates cofactor dependent enzymic phosphorylation dehydrogenation single, closed-loop system employing phosphoenolpyruvate sacrificial reagent sequential ATP NAD+ recycling steps. Exemplary applications developed synthesis 6-phosphogluconate glucose, dihydroxyacetone phosphate glycerol. latter system combined exergonic diastereoselective aldol additions one-flask synthesis ketosugar (D-sorbose), thiosugar (L-threo-5-thiopentulose), sugar acid (L-threo-pent-4-ulosonic acid) starting mixture glycerol simple aldehydes.
