 prognosis pancreatic cancer poor, developing new therapeutic strategies cancer needed. Recently, Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) attracted much attention function tumorigenesis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) executes final step aerobic glycolysis reported involved tumor progression. However, function LDHA pancreatic cancer studied. Here, found expression LDHA elevated clinical pancreatic cancer samples. Forced expression LDHA promoted growth pancreatic cancer cells, knocking expression LDHA inhibited cell growth dramatically. Moreover, silencing expression LDHA inhibited tumorigenicity pancreatic cancer cells vivo. Mechanistically, knocking expression LDHA activated apoptosis pathway. Taken together, study revealed oncogenic role LDHA pancreatic cancer suggested LDHA might potential therapeutic target.
