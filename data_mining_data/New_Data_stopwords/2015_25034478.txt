 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) one common cancers worldwide good candidate screening programmes. However, controversy concerning available screening tests used. SUMMARY: general agreement screening CRC asymptomatic population begin age 50. Several different screening methods available separated mainly detect cancers: faecal occult blood tests [guaiac (FOBT) immunochemical (FIT)], genetic stool tests, blood tests M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) test. Methods detect cancers polyps colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, CT-colonography (CT-C) colon capsule endoscopy. tests reduction CRC mortality compared screening proven randomized trials FOBT sigmoidoscopy. Several trials suggest FIT superior FOBT terms detection rates cancers advanced adenomas possibly compliance. indirect evidence suggesting efficacy colonoscopy screening test. role CT-C controversial. data suggesting good sensitivity neoplasia >9 mm lower sensitivity smaller neoplasia. However, radiation exposure considered major limitation countries. Unresolved questions include lesion cut-off referral colonoscopy work-up extracolonic findings. methods, like genetic stool testing using newer markers, blood tests, capsule endoscopy M2-PK, currently insufficient data screening asymptomatic population. Key Messages: Colorectal screening recommended performed form organized programme. detection early-stage cancers aim screening programme, FIT seem superior FOBT. detection removal adenomas aim screening programme, endoscopic methods seem good alternatives. Sigmoidoscopy easier perform likely effect distal cancers. Colonoscopy invasive enables inspection whole colon. role CT-C, capsule endoscopy, genetic stool tests, blood tests M2-PK currently unknown.
