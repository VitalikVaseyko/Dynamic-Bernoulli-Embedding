 Mammalian embryos transiently exhibit aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), metabolic adaptation also observed cancer cells. role particular type metabolism vertebrate organogenesis currently unknown. Here, provide evidence spatiotemporal regulation glycolysis posterior region mouse chicken embryos. show posterior glycolytic gradient established response graded transcription glycolytic enzymes downstream fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. demonstrate glycolysis controls posterior elongation embryonic axis regulating cell motility presomitic mesoderm controlling specification paraxial mesoderm fate tail bud. results suggest glycolysis tail bud coordinates Wnt FGF signaling promote elongation embryonic axis.
