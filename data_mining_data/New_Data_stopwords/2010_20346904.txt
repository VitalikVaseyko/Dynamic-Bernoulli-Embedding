 Homo sapiens Arabidopsis thaliana genomes believed encode 500 1000 protein kinases, respectively. Despite abundance, bona fide kinase-client relationships described detail. describe quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach identifying kinase-client proteins. method development, used dedicated kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) vitro assays. kinase substrate, used synthetic peptide cocktails and, process, demonstrated assay sensitive specific. method also useful characterizing protein kinase-substrate kinetics peptide substrate detected. Applying label-free spectral counting method, activity PDK determined using peptide substrate YHGH(292)SMSDPGSTYR derived pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit sequence. utility spectral counting validated studying negative effect Met oxidation peptide phosphorylation. also measured activity unrelated calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (CPK3), demonstrating utility method protein kinase screening applications.
