 ADP, generated red blood cells believed responsible spontaneous aggregation platelets whole blood. notion based mainly use enzymes remove ADP. studied spontaneous platelet aggregation whole blood autologous platelet rich plasma obtained 12 healthy male female volunteers. Platelet aggregation quantitated measuring fall number single platelets counted using whole blood platelet counter (Ultra Flo 100). rotating tube model, mean fall number platelets due spontaneous aggregation 56% whole blood but, 3% platelet rich plasma prepared blood samples. Spontaneous platelet aggregation whole blood unaffected apyrase grade I, reduced 15% apyrase grade II, 38% creatine phosphokinase/creatine phosphate 9% pyruvate kinase/phosphoenolpyruvate. results study provide additional evidence ADP generated whole blood triggers spontaneous aggregation platelets.
