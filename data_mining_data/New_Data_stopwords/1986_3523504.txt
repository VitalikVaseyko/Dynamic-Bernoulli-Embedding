 demonstrated metabolic responses ingested carbohydrate depend genetic make-up recipient; type ingested carbohydrate molecule, amount nature protein, fat different trace elements diet. elements affect glucose tolerance, insulin response, number insulin receptors blood lipids hepatic content synthesis. metabolic responses differ within species. Experiments selection feeding animals different genetic susceptibility carbohydrate intake may explain individuals groups different sensitivity may develop high blood glucose and/or lipid levels, whereas individuals retain normal values consuming amount carbohydrate. also explains why, community, certain percentage population develop diabetes carbohydrate-induced lipidemia others not.
