 previous study found 30-40% dimethylsulfoxide induces active conformation rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. dimethylsulfoxide known perturb structure function many proteins, explored effect trehalose kinetics thermal inactivation stability pyruvate kinase; trehalose, contrast dimethyl sulfoxide, totally excluded hydration shell proteins. results show 600 mM trehalose inhibits activity pyruvate kinase 20% 25 degrees C, however, trehalose protects pyruvate kinase thermal inactivation 60 degrees C, increases Tm(app) unfolding 7.2 degrees C, induces compact state, stabilizes tetrameric structure. inactivation process irreversible due formation protein aggregates. Trehalose diminishes rate formation intermediates propensity aggregate, affect extent aggregation. Remarkably, trehalose affects aggregation process inducing aggregates amyloid-like characteristics.
