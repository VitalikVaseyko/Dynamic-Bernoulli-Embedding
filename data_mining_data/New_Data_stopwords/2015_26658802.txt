 SUN2, key component LINC (linker nucleoskeleton cytoskeleton) complex located inner nuclear membrane, plays unknown role lung cancer. found SUN2 expression decreased lung cancer tissue compared paired normal tissues higher SUN2 levels predicted better overall survival first progression survival. Overexpression SUN2 inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation migration lung cancer, whereas knockdown SUN2 promotes cell proliferation migration. Additionally, SUN2 increases sensitivity lung cancer cisplatin inducing cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, showed SUN2 exerts tumor suppressor functions decreasing expression GLUT1 LDHA inhibit Warburg effect. Finally, results provided evidence SIRT5 acts, least partly, negative regulator SUN2.Taken together, findings indicate SUN2 key component lung cancer progression inhibiting Warburg effect novel SIRT5/SUN2 axis may prove useful development new strategies treating patients lung cancer.
