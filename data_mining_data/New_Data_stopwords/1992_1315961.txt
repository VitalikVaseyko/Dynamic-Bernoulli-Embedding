 glucose/insulin response element L-pyruvate kinase gene perfect palindrome located nt -168 -144 respect cap site. element (L4) partially homologous MLTF binding sites. full efficiency requires cooperation contiguous binding site HNF4, termed L3 located nt -145 -125. presence L4 element contiguous L3, cyclic AMP inhibits activity L-PK promoter absence, normal L4-L3 contiguity modified, cyclic AMP behaves transcriptional activator seem sequence-specific. Therefore, propose mechanism inhibition L-PK gene cyclic AMP requires precise interactions nucleoprotein complex built sites L4 L3 components L-PK transcription initiation complex.
