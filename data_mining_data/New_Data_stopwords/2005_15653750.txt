 Inbred mouse strains known many years vary degree susceptibility different types infectious diseases. genetic basis interstrain differences sometimes simple often complex. cases, positional cloning used successfully identify single gene effects. natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) gene (Slc11a1) codes metal transporter active phagosomal membrane macrophages, Nramp1 mutations cause susceptibility Mycobacterium, Salmonella, Leishmania. Furthermore, recent advances gene transfer technologies transgenic mice enabled functional dissection gene effects mapping complex, repeated parts genome, Lgn1 locus, causing susceptibility Legionella pneumophila macrophages. Finally, complex traits genetically determined susceptibility malaria sometimes broken multiple single gene effects. One example case pyruvate kinase, loss-of-function mutation recently shown group protective blood-stage infection Plasmodium chabaudi. three cases reviewed, characterization noted gene effect(s) shed considerable light pathophysiology infection, including host response mechanisms.
