 influence caloric restriction (CR) activities hepatic serine metabolizing enzymes young (3 months) old (30 months) mice studied. Serine dehydratase (SDH) activity increased markedly age diet groups old mice higher CR group. effects CR observed young. Serine:pyruvate transaminase (SPT) glycerate kinase activities unaffected age diet. However, glycerate dehydrogenase activity decreased old CR mice young CR. results study show long-term CR influenced serine utilization pathway catalyzed SDH. suggests mouse liver pathway critical serine utilization gluconeogenesis, SPT pathway plays minor role. increase SDH activity long-term CR consistent sustained increase gluconeogenesis.
