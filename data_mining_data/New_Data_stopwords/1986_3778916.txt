 influence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate L-alanine kinetics pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate O2-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) Phycomyces blakesleeanus NRRL 1555 (-) studied pH 7.5. addition fructose 1,6-bisphosphate sigmoid kinetics respect phosphoenol pyruvate Mg2+ abolished velocity curves became hyperbolic. presence L-alanine positive homotropic cooperativity respect phosphoenol pyruvate increased Hill coefficient values close 4, sigmoid kinetics respect Mg2+ became hyperbolic. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate overcomes inhibition produced L-alanine, antagonism phosphoenol pyruvate L-alanine also evident. Inhibition found high Mg2+ concentrations, compatible binding magnesium ions inactive conformational state enzyme. data analysed basis two-states concerted-symmetry model Monod, Wyman Changeux, parameters model calculated. Phosphoenol pyruvate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate appeared show exclusive binding active conformational state (R), whereas magnesium ions bind preferentially, factor 45, R state. L-Alanine binds readily inactive state enzyme.
