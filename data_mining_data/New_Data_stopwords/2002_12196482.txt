 Pyruvate kinase key glycolytic enzyme. Isoforms expressed red cell, liver, pancreatic beta-cells, small intestine, proximal renal tubule encoded 12 exons PKLR gene, maps chromosome 1q23. hypothesized common variants PKLR gene could account linkage diabetes region. screened promoter regions, exons surrounding introns, 3' untranslated region mutations. identified five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one (V506I, exon 11) altered coding sequence. tested five SNPs, poly-T insertion-deletion polymorphism, ATT triplet repeat 131 unrelated diabetic patients 118 nondiabetic control subjects. V506I variant rare associated type 2 diabetes. four SNPs insertion-deletion polymorphism associated diabetes, 10% difference individuals diabetes nondiabetic individuals (P = 0.001-0.011, relative risk minor allele 1.85). trend found ATT repeat (P = 0.029). Common variants PKLR associated increased risk type 2 diabetes, strong linkage disequilibrium variants, actual susceptibility allele may different gene.
