 role pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) tumor progression controversial. Previous studies showed PKM2 promoted tumor growth xenograft models; however, depletion PKM2 Brca1-loss-driven mammary tumor mouse model accelerates tumor formation. Since oncogenic kinases frequently activated tumors PKM2 phosphorylation promotes tumor growth, hypothesized phosphorylation PKM2 activated kinases tumor cells confers PKM2 oncogenic function, whereas non-phosphorylated PKM2 non-oncogenic. Indeed, PKM2 phosphorylated tyrosine 105 (Y105) formed oncogenic dimers MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, whereas PKM2 largely unphosphorylated formed non-tumorigenic tetramers non-transformed MCF10A cells. PKM2 knockdown affect MCF10A cell growth significantly decreased proliferation MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells tyrosine kinase activation. Multiple kinases frequently activated different cancer types identified phosphorylate PKM2-Y105 tyrosine kinase screening. Introduction PKM2-Y105D phospho-mimetic mutant MCF10A cells induced colony formation CD44hi/CD24neg cancer stem-like cell population increasing YAP protein nuclear localization. ErbB2, strong inducer PKM2-Y105 phosphorylation, boosted nuclear localization YAP enhanced cancer stem-like cell population. Treatment ErbB2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib decreased PKM2-Y105 phosphorylation cancer stem-like cells, impeding PKM2 tumor-promoting function. Taken together, phosphorylation PKM2-Y105 activated kinases exerts oncogenic functions part via activation YAP downstream signaling increase cancer stem-like cell properties.
