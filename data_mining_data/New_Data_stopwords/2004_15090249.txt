 simple diagnostic method mechanistic analysis reversible enzyme inhibitors presented. method involves simple experimentation determine inhibition reversible inhibitor changes response substrate concentration varied assay. Four types inhibitors categorized based kinetic characteristic: (1) competitive mutually exclusive inhibitors compete substrate enzyme; (2) noncompetitive inhibitors independent substrate binding enzyme; (3) antagonistic inhibitors binding affinity inhibitor partially reduced substrate binding enzyme; (4) synergistic inhibitors inhibitor binding enhanced substrate binding. equation derived data fitting subsequent determination inhibitor binding mode. method evaluated three model enzyme systems, i.e., PK, adenylate kinase, LDH, known inhibitors. method also used characterize large number unknown Csp3 inhibitors identified HTS compound library consisting 120,000 distinct chemical entities, field test validated utility method. Among 76 Csp3 inhibitors analyzed, 70 found non-mutually exclusive inhibitors, suggesting existence allosteric site(s) Csp3 effective inhibition. implication observation discussed.
