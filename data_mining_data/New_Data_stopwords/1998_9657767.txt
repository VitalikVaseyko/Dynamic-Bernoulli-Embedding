 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency common cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. present 6 previously undescribed mutations PKLR gene associated enzyme deficiency located cDNA nt 476 G-->T (159Gly-->Val), 884 C-->T (295Ala-->Val), 943 G-->A (315Glu-->Lys), 1022 G-->A (341Gly-->Asp), 1511 G-->T (504Arg-->Leu), 1528 C-->T (510Arg-->Ter). Two mutations near substrate binding site: 315Glu-->Lys (943A) mutation may involved Mg2+ binding 159Gly-->Val (476T) mutation possible effect ADP binding. Four six mutations produce deduced changes shape molecule. Two mutations, 504Arg-->Leu (1511T) 510Arg-->Ter (1528T), located interface domains C. One (510Arg-->Ter) deletion C-terminal residues affecting integrity protein. 504Arg-->Leu mutation eliminates stabilizing interaction domains C. Changes amino acid 341(nt 1022) Gly Asp cause local perturbations. mutation 295Ala-->Val (884T) might affect way pyruvate kinase interacts molecules. review previously described mutations conclude yet sufficient data allow us draw conclusions regarding genotype/phenotype relationship.
