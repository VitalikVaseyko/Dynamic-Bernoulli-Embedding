 Three biomimetic dye ligands bearing triazine-linked terminal moiety carboxylated structure, mimics substrates inhibitors L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), immobilized cross-linked agarose Ultrogel A6R. biomimetic dyes purpose-designed analogues commercial monochlorotriazine Cibacron Blue 3GA (CB3GA) parent dichlorotriazine Vilmafix Blue A-R (VBAR). corresponding biomimetic adsorbents, along non-biomimetic adsorbents bearing CB3GA VBAR, evaluated ability purify LDH bovine heart crude extract. compared non-biomimetic adsorbents, biomimetic adsorbents exhibited higher purifying ability. Further, one immobilized biomimetic dye, bearing mercaptopyruvic acid biomimetic moiety, displayed highest purifying ability. concentration immobilized dye affected capacity purifying ability affinity column, exhibiting optimum value 2.2 mumol dye/g moist gel. affinity adsorbent exploited purification LDH bovine heart two-step procedure. procedure consisted biomimetic dye affinity chromatography step (NAD+/sulphite elution, 25-fold purification, 64% step yield), followed DEAE-agarose ion-exchange chromatography (1.4-fold purification, 78% step yield). purified enzyme exhibited specific activity ca. 480 u/mg 25 degrees C (content impurities: pyruvate kinase glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase detected; malate dehydrogenase, 0.01%), compared ca. 250 u/mg commercial bovine heart LDH (malate dehydrogenase, 0.05%) suitable analytical purposes.
