 Reversible phosphorylation proteins regulates numerous aspects cell function, abnormal phosphorylation causal many diseases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) central regulation glucose homeostasis. PDC exists dynamic equilibrium de-phospho-(active) phosphorylated (inactive) forms controlled pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDP1,2) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4). contrast reciprocal regulation phospho-/de-phospho cycle PDC level expression isoforms PDK PDP regulated hormones diet, scant evidence regulatory factors acting vivo reciprocal "on-off" switches. show putative insulin mediator inositol phosphoglycan P-type (IPG-P) sigmoidal inhibitory action PDK addition known linear stimulation PDP. Thus, critical levels IPG-P, sigmoidal/linear model markedly enhances switchover inactive active form PDC, "push-pull" system that, combined developmental hormonal control IPG-P, indicates powerful regulatory function. release IPGs cell membranes insulin significant relation diabetes. chelation IPGs Mn2+ Zn2+ suggests role "catalytic chelators" coordinating traffic metal ions cells. Synthetic inositol hexosamine analogues shown similar linear/sigmoidal reciprocal action PDC exerting push-pull effects, suggesting potential treatment metabolic disorders, including diabetes.
