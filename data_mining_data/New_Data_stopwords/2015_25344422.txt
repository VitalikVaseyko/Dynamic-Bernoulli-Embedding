 BACKGROUND: role M2-PK (pyruvate kinase) bile studied comparison brushings carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 diagnosis malignant biliary strictures. AIM: compare diagnostic accuracy biliary M2-PK cytology serum CA 19-9 METHODS: prospective cross-sectional study, bile aspirated 74 patients (discovery validation cohort) undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Levels M2-PK measured bile compared brushings cytology CA 19-9. RESULTS: discovery cohort, median bile M2-PK levels significantly elevated patients malignant biliary strictures [187.9 U/l (interquartile range (IQR) 3.5, 3626.8)] compared benign biliary conditions primary sclerosing cholangitis [0 U/l (IQR 0, 15)] (P = 0.007). M2-PK cutoff value 109.1 U/l distinguished malignant benign conditions sensitivity specificity 52.9 94.1 %, respectively, area curve (AUC) 0.77. sensitivity CA 19-9 brushings diagnosing cancer 52.9 % 11.1 % specificity 94.1 100 %, respectively. presence elevated M2-PK >109.1 U/l CA 19-9 >33 U/ml positive brushing 88.2 % sensitive 88.2 % specific, AUC 0.89 diagnosis malignancy. diagnostic accuracy confirmed validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: stand-alone factor, none markers able distinguish benign malignant biliary strictures high sensitivity. However, combination highly sensitive diagnosing malignant biliary strictures.
