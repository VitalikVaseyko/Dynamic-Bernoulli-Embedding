 Dendritic cells (DCs) potent antigen-presenting cells (APC) particularly important initiation primary cell-mediated immune responses. Thus, inhibition differentiation function DC could lead suppression immunological hyperresponsiveness. Artemisia iwayomogi, member Compositae, perennial herb easily found Korea used traditional anti-inflammatory medicine. investigated suppressive effects carbohydrate fraction 1 water extracts A. iwayomogi (AIP1) differentiation function bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Bone marrow cells cultured presence granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) interleukin (IL)-4 6-7 days. Then, non-adherent cells harvested subsequent analyses. Percentage(s) CD11c+ MHC II+ cell population(s) mostly composed immature mature DC allogeneic cell stimulating ability cells reduced AIP1. Proteomic analyses along RT-PCR revealed expressions several proteins including TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 5-like protein, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), coactosin-like protein 1 (CLP1) down-regulated upon AIP1 treatment.
