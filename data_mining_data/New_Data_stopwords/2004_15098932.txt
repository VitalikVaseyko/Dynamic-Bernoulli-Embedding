 Manganese (Mn) trace metal required normal growth development. Manganese neurotoxicity rare usually associated occupational exposures. However, cellular molecular mechanisms underlying Mn toxicity still elusive. rats chronically exposed Mn, brain regional Mn levels increase dose-related manner. Brain Mn preferentially accumulates mitochondria; accumulation enhanced Mn treatment vivo. Exposure mitochondria Mn vitro leads uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. observations prompted us investigate hypothesis Mn induces alterations energy metabolism neural cells interfering activities various glycolytic TCA cycle enzymes using human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) astrocytoma (U87) cells. Treatments SK-N-SH U87 cells MnCl2 induced cell death cells, concentration- time-dependent manner, determined MTT assays. parallel Mn-induced, dose-dependent decrease cell survival, treatment cells 0.01 4.0 mM MnCl2 48 h also induced dose-related decreases activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase. Hexokinase SK-N-SH cells affected Mn treatments, even lower range concentrations. Mn treatment SK-N-SH cells affected pyruvate kinase citrate synthase lesser extent compared effect enzymes investigated. However, citrate synthase pyruvate kinase U87 cells vulnerable enzymes investigated effects Mn. results suggest two cell types exhibited differential susceptibility toward Mn-induced effects. Additionally, results may significant implications flux control HK first highly regulated enzyme brain glycolysis. Thus results consistent hypothesis may pathophysiological implications mechanisms underlying Mn neurotoxicity.
