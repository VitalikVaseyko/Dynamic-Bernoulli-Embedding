 Phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase component (E1) muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) E1-kinase inhibits substrate conversion oxidative non-oxidative reactions. Circular dichroism spectra used monitor effect phosphorylation following stages process: holoform formation apo-E1 thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), substrate binding active site deacetylation. shown phosphorylation E1 reduces affinity TPP prevents holo-E1 interaction pyruvate. Phosphorylated dephosphorylated PDC convert 2-hydroxyethyl-TPP similar ways involving half active sites; active sites E1 function presence deacetylating agents. data obtained suggest phosphorylation substrate binding sites interact other.
