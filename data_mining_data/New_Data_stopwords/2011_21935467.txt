 Warburg Effect characterized irreversible injury mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) increased rate aerobic glycolysis. study, utilized breast epithelial cell line lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho(0)) exhibits Warburg Effect associated breast cancer. developed MitoExpress array rapid analysis known nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteome. gene-expression pattern compared among normal breast epithelial cell line, rho(0) derivative, breast cancer cell lines primary breast tumors. Among several genes, study revealed over-expression mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP2 rho(0) breast epithelial cells reflects gene expression changes breast cancer cell lines primary breast tumors. Furthermore, over-expression UCP2 also found leukemia, ovarian, bladder, esophagus, testicular, colorectal, kidney, pancreatic, lung prostate tumors. Ectopic expression UCP2 MCF7 breast cancer cells led decreased mitochondrial membrane potential increased tumorigenic properties measured cell migration, vitro invasion anchorage independent growth. Consistent vitro studies, demonstrate UCP2 over-expression leads development tumors vivo orthotopic model breast cancer. Genipin, plant derived small molecule, suppressed UCP2 led tumorigenic properties, mediated decreased reactive oxygen species down-regulation UCP2. However, UCP1, 3, 4 5 gene expression unaffected. UCP2 transcription controlled SMAD4. Together, studies suggest tumor-promoting function UCP2 breast cancer. summary, studies demonstrate i) Warburg Effect mediated UCP2; ii) UCP2 over-expressed breast many cancers; iii) UCP2 promotes tumorigenic properties vitro vivo iv) genipin suppresses tumor promoting function UCP2.
