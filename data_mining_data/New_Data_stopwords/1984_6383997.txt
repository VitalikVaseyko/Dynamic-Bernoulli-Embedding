 Periportal (pp) perivenous (pv) hepatocyte populations separated using two-directional closed perfusion technique selective addition collagenase either direct retrograde perfusions (Vaananen, H. et al., Liver 1983; 3:131). activity GPT hepatocytes pp-area 1.9 times higher cells pv-area (p less 0.01). distribution glutamate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities reversed; pp/pv ratios 0.7 0.5, respectively, observed (p less 0.001, p less 0.05). Chronic ethanol consumption 12 weeks (mean daily ethanol intake 11.4 gm per body weight corresponding 29% total energy intake) cause histological changes decreased GPT activity, increased glutamate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities alter pp/pv distribution. Alcohol dehydrogenase aldehyde dehydrogenase activities evenly distributed pp- pv-hepatocytes. Chronic ethanol treatment slightly decreased alcohol dehydrogenase activity (p less 0.05) increased activity low Km aldehyde dehydrogenase (p less 0.001, p less 0.05). specific activity NADPH-dependent microsomal ethanol oxidation 50% higher pv-hepatocytes (p less 0.05). Chronic ethanol treatment increase specific activity microsomal ethanol oxidation reduced pp-pv activity difference. results indicate enzymatic capacity oxidize ethanol evenly distributed acinus that, long-term moderate ethanol treatment, despite lack parenchymal lesions, changes activity enzymes involved ethanol metabolism observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
