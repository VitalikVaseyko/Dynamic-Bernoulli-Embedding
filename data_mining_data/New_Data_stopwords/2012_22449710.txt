 combination curcumin TRAIL role enhancing apoptotic cell death reported many studies. However, exact molecular mechanism apoptosis mediated curcumin tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) yet completely understood. study, observed close connection dephosphorylated Akt increase phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) combined treatment curcumin TRAIL. Akt dephosphorylation cumulatively regulated protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), src. PP1 PDK1 directly interacted HSP27, whereas src indirectly interacted HSP27 via tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 complex. conclusion, HSP27 modulated cell survival interactions various binding partners, depending level phosphorylated HSP27.
