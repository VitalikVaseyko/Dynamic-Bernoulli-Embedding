 Phytomonas sp. isolated Euphorbia characias adapted SDM-79 medium. Cells isolated early stationary phase growth analyzed capacity utilize plant carbohydrates energy requirements. cellulose-degrading enzymes amylase, amylomaltase, invertase, carboxymethylcellulase, pectin-degrading enzymes polygalacturonase oligo-D-galactosiduronate lyase present Phytomonas sp. all, except amylomaltase, excreted external medium. Glucose, fructose mannose served major energy substrates. Catabolism carbohydrates occurred mainly via aerobic glycolysis according Embden-Meyerhof pathway, enzymes detected. Likewise, end-products glycolysis, acetate pyruvate, glycerol, succinate ethanol detected culture medium, enzymes responsible production. Mitochondria incapable oxidizing succinate, 2-oxoglutarate, pyruvate, malate proline, high capacity oxidize glycerol 3-phosphate. oxidation completely inhibited salicylhydroxamic acid. cytochromes could detected either intact mitochondria sub-mitochondrial particles. Mitochondrial respiration inhibited antimycin, azide cyanide. glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase phosphoglycerate kinase, enzymes glycerol kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase adenylate kinase, associated glycosomes buoyant density 1.24 g cm-1 sucrose. Cytochemical staining revealed presence catalase organelles. cytosolic enzyme pyruvate kinase activated fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, typical pyruvate kinases Kinetoplastida. energy metabolism plant parasite Phytomonas sp. isolated E. characias resembled bloodstream form mammalian parasite Trypanosoma brucei.
