 Blood patients sickle cell anemia (SS) exhibits decreased affinity oxygen, although oxygen affinity hemoglobin hemoglobin A. SS red cells contain 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) normal erythrocytes. oxygen affinity hemolyzed red cells decreased added DPG, hemolysates prepared SS red cells differ normal hemolysates regard. Reduction oxygen affinity levels found intact SS red cells required DPG concentrations excess found SS patients. true oxygen affinity patients pyruvate kinase deficiency. organic phosphates, well inorganic ions, known alter oxygen affinity dilute solutions hemoglobin. substances, state aggregation hemoglobin molecules, cytoarchitectural factors probably play roles determining oxygen affinity normal SS red cells.
