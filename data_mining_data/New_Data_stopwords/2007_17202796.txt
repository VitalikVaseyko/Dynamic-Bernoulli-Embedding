 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) phosphorylates inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex respond physiologic conditions. response switches energy source glucose fatty acids maintain blood glucose levels. Transcription PDK4 gene activated fasting administration peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligand tissue-specific manner. However, two mechanisms induce PDK4 mRNA well relationship two studied detail. study, show two mechanisms independent, least mouse skeletal muscle, estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) directly involved PPARalpha-independent transcriptional activation PDK4 gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) specific partner. latter conclusion based following evidence: 1) Deletion point mutation analyses cloned mouse PDK4 gene promoter sequence identified exact possible ERRalpha-binding motif PGC-1alpha responsive element. 2) overexpression ERRalpha cotransfection enhanced, knocking specific shRNAs diminished, PGC-1alpha-dependent activation. 3) Specific binding ERRalpha identified PGC-1alpha-responsive sequence mouse PDK4 promoter confirmed electrophoresis mobility shift assay using anti-ERRalpha antibodies. results suggest PGC-1alpha plays essential role regulating amounts energy creating enzymes, also step metabolic switching unevenly distributed tissue transcription factors ERRalpha skeletal muscle, thus harmonizing tissue-specific functions energy metabolism.
