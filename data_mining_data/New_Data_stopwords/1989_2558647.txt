 Following endotoxin administration fasted rats, liver fructose 2,6-bisphosphate level significantly increased within 1 hr, elevated 2.3-fold 3 hrs, remains elevated 2 3-fold least 24 hrs. increase potent allosteric activator phosphofructokinase occurs change liver Glc 6-P, glycogen cAMP concentrations, activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase. increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration accounts increased phosphofructokinase activity previously observed hepatocytes isolated 18 hours following endotoxin administration rats (1). stimulating phosphofructokinase/Fru 1,6-bisphosphate cycle direction glycolysis, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate likely factor responsible decreased gluconeogenesis endotoxemia.
