 OBJECTIVE: observe effects ethyl pyruvate (EP) treatment multiple organ dysfunction mortality following delayed resuscitation burn injury rat, investigate mechanisms protective effect. METHODS: Male Wistar rats subjected 30% full-thickness scald injury followed delayed resuscitation (6 hours postburn). (1) One hundred thirty male Wistar rats randomly divided sham scald group (n=10), scald group (n=60) EP-treatment group (n=60). scald group, 40 ml/kg normal saline injected intraperitoneally 6 hours scald injury resuscitation, repeated periodically. Following delayed resuscitation burn injury, EP injected dose 40 mg/kg every 12 hours EP-treatment group 3 days. According interventional time points, rats scald EP-treatment groups respectively divided three subgroups: 2 hours prior scald (n=20), 2 hours scald (n=20), 12 hours scald (n=20). mortality animals observed 7 days cut point. (2) Seventy male rats randomly divided sham scald group (n=10), scald group (n=30), EP-treatment group (n=30). EP-treatment group, 40 mg/kg EP injected intraperitoneally 2 hours scald. Animals sacrificed 12, 24, 72 hours postburn, serum samples collected determine organ functional parameters, lung tissue obtained measurement myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. RESULT: 7-day mortality scald EP-treatment groups (EP given 12 hours postburn) 75.0% 35.0% respectively (P<0.05). Compared scald group, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) creatine kinase (CK) levels markedly decreased EP-treatment group 12 24 hours postburn (P<0.05 P<0.01), pulmonary MPO activities also significantly declined 12 72 hours following burns (P<0.05 P<0.01). CONCLUSION: EP obviously improve outcome rats delayed resuscitation burn injury, prevent development multiple organ dysfunction secondary major burns.
