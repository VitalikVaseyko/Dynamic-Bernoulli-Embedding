 investigation evaluated adaptive response glycolytic enzymes, fructose-1-phosphate aldolase, fructose-1, 6-diphosphate aldolase, pyruvate kinase, dietary sugars throughout small intestine. addition, effect prior diet adaptive response enzyme distribution pattern along small intestine studied. Rats fed 40% glucose, 68% sucrose carbohydrate-free diets 6 days (baseline diet), followed one three isocaloric test diets (40% glucose, 68% sucrose carbohydrate-free 3 days. groups tats isocaloric diets 68% glucose, 68% fructose 34% glucose + 34% fructose, fed 4 days, compared. Enzymes assayed mucosa duodenum (D),and 5 equal (by length) segments Ligament Treitz ileocecal valve (J1, J2, J3, I1 I2). Enzyme specific activities significantly higher proximal (D-J1-J2) distal segments (J3-I1-I2) diets (P smaller 0.001). Enzyme activities test diet periods determined test diet, independent baseline diet segments. 68% carbohydrate diets increased enzyme activities significantly (P smaller 0.001) 40% glucose carbohydrate free diets, segments. 40% glucose diet, activities significantly higher (P smaller 0.05) carbohydrate free diet J1, distally. data suggest intrinsic gradient enzyme activity proximal distal small intestine persists despite dietary manipulation, segments small bowel show adaptive increases dietary sugars.
