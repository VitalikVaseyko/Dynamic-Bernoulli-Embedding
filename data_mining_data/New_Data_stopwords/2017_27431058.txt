 Although oxidative stress known impede tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidative phosphorylation, nutritionally-versatile microbe, Pseudomonas fluorescens shown proliferate presence hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) nitrosative stress. study demonstrate phospho-transfer system enables organism generate ATP similar irrespective carbon source utilized. Despite diminished activities enzymes involved TCA cycle electron transport chain (ETC), ATP levels appear significantly affected stressed cells. Phospho-transfer networks mediated acetate kinase (ACK), adenylate kinase (AK), nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) involved maintaining ATP homeostasis oxidatively-challenged cells. phospho-relay machinery orchestrated substrate-level phosphorylation aided up-regulation activities enzymes like phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PEPS). enhanced production phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate fuel synthesis ATP. Taken together, metabolic reconfiguration enables organism fulfill ATP need O2-independent manner utilizing intricate phospho-wire module aimed maximizing energy potential PEP participation AMP.
