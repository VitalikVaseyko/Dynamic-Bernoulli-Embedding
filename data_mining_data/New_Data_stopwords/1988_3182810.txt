 first branch point gluconeogenesis occurs conversion pyruvate oxaloacetate. determine amount lactate carbon reaching glucose via direct pyruvate carboxylase pathway versus tricarboxylic acid cycle, adult rat hepatocytes primary culture incubated 2 h one following isotopic substrates: [1-14C]lactate, [U-14C]lactate, [1,2-14C]acetate. Production 14CO2 [14C]glucose substrate assessed. amount lactate carbon 2 3 incorporated glucose oxidized CO2 determined subtracting values using [1-14C]lactate using [U-14C]lactate. quantitation CO2 formed carbons 2 3 lactate, amount carbons incorporated glucose via tricarboxylic acid cycle determined simple proportionality ratio label incorporated glucose CO2 [1,2-14C]acetate. remaining carbons 2 3 lactate incorporated glucose derived pyruvate carboxylase pathway directly. Ethanol oxidation provides NADH acetate decreased lactate oxidation enhanced pyruvate carboxylase pathway. Glucagon increased carbon flux pathways primarily pyruvate carboxylase pathway. summary, simple model presented examine carbon flux lactate via pyruvate carboxylase tricarboxylic acid pathways gluconeogenesis.
