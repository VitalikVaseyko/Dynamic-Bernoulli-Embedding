 Statin use may limited muscle side effects. Although incompletely understood date, pathophysiology may involve oxidative stress impairments mitochondrial function muscle Ca(2+) homeostasis. order simultaneously assess mechanisms, 24 male healthy volunteers randomized receive either simvastatin 80 mg daily placebo 8 weeks. Blood urine samples stress test performed baseline follow-up, mitochondrial respiration Ca(2+) spark properties evaluated muscle biopsy 4 days second stress test. Simvastatin-treated subjects separated according median creatine kinase (CK) increase. Simvastatin treatment induced significant elevation aspartate amino transferase (3.38+/-5.68 vs -1.15+/-4.32 UI/L, P<0.001) CK (-24.3+/-99.1+/-189.3 vs 48.3 UI/L, P=0.01) trend elevation isoprostanes (193+/-408 vs 12+/-53 pmol/mmol creatinine, P=0.09) global change mitochondrial respiration, lactate/pyruvate ratio Ca(2+) sparks. However, among statin-treated subjects, highest CK increase displayed significantly lower Vmax rotenone succinate increase Ca(2+) spark amplitude vs subjects lowest CK increase placebo-treated subjects. Moreover, Ca(2+) spark amplitude positively correlated treatment-induced CK increase whole group (r=0.71, P=0.0045). conclusion, study supports statin induced muscular toxicity may related alterations mitochondrial respiration muscle calcium homeostasis independently underlying disease concomitant medication.
