 pyruvate kinase isozymes M1 M2 structurally immunologically closely related. obtain antibody discriminates two forms, synthetic tetradecapeptide sequence specific pyruvate kinase type M2 rats constructed. Antisera rabbits, immunized peptide, reacted specifically M2-type holoenzyme rat human origin, cross-react M1-type isozyme. established immunoblot analysis, dissociating non-dissociating conditions.
