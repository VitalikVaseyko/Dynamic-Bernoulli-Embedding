 1. Pyruvate kinase isozyme shift regenerating rat liver studied. Rats subjected 70% hepatectomy liver homogenate hepatocyte preparations obtained regenerating liver. 2. Using thin layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, liver homogenates intact normal rat appeared contain L-type isozyme greatest number M2-type lesser extent. 3. ratio M2- L-type increased preparations obtained regenerating liver. 4. hepatocyte preparations prepared regenerating rat liver conventional method, small amount M2-type isozyme detected. 5. However, M2-type isozyme hardly detected highly purified hepatocyte preparations prepared using Percoll. 6. Similar results obtained separation enzyme DEAE cellulose column chromatography. 7. results suggest pyruvate kinase isozyme shift L- M2-type hepatocytes course regeneration. 8. increased M2-type isozyme regenerating rat liver considered originate nonparenchymal cells.
