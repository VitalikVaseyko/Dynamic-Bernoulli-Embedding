 major role corpus luteum biosynthesis progesterone. Luteal function investigated following plasma progesterone concentrations studying ultrastructural histochemical changes corpora lutea. Recently, changes enzyme activities concerned formation degradation progesterone taken investigation order understand regulation luteal function. rat ovaries, progestational potency ovarian secretions regulated activity 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrgoenase (20 alpha-HSD), catabolizes progesterone 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one, progestatinally inert steroid. regressing corpora lutea, extensive conversion progesterone 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one occurred marked increase 20 alpha-HSD activity well decrease plasma progesterone concentrations. hand, histochemical studies glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) delta5-3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) investigated without remarkable changes corporalutea early stages luteolysis. present study activities steroidogenic enzymes corpora lutea pregnant rats measured treatment variety abortifacient drugs, compared corpora lutea 1 day post partum rats showed changes characteristic spontaneous luteolysis. days 7 9 pregnancy, Wistar-strain pregnant rats injected either prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha), aminoglutethimide clomiphene citrate (clomid). Animals sacrificed 15 63 hrs. last injection, implantation sites inspected. Ovaries removed, corpora lutea dissected free, weighed homogenized. homogenate centrifuged 105,000g 60 min. supernatant solution assayed activities G 6 PDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6 PGDH), malic enzyme, ATP citrate lysase, 20 alpha-HSD pyruvate kinase. pellet fraction re-homogenized, centrifugated 2,000 g 5 min. supernatant solution used assay 3 beta-HSD. Complete fetal resorption observed rats treated PGF2alpha, 7 15 rats (47%) treated PGF2alpha LH-RH maintained pregnancy. intact rats treatment drugs, lutein cells showed ultrastructures characteristic luteolysis, although degree luteolysis greatly diminished compared PGF2alpha-treated ones. agreement ultrastructural findings, 20alpha-HSD activity corpora lutea maintained rather low level intact rats, increased moderately aborted ones treatment drugs. PGF2alpha-treated rats, G 6 PDH activity increased 140% malic enzyme activity decreased 27% activity control rats. aminoglutethimide-treated rats, activites G 6 PDH malic enzyme decreased, 2-alpha-HSD activity maintained low level...
