 MCK1 gene Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes protein kinase homologous metazoan glycogen synthase kinase-3. Previous studies implicated Mck1p negative regulation pyruvate kinase. study find purified Mck1p phosphorylate pyruvate kinase, suggesting link indirect. find purified Tpk1p, cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, phosphorylates purified pyruvate kinase vitro, loss cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit, Bcy1p, increases pyruvate kinase activity vivo. find purified Mck1p inhibits purified Tpk1p vitro, presence absence Bcy1p. Mck1p must catalytically active inhibit Tpk1p, Mck1p phosphorylate target. find abolition Mck1p autophosphorylation tyrosine prevents kinase efficiently phosphorylating exogenous substrates, block ability inhibit Tpk1p vitro. find mutant form Mck1p appears retain ability negatively regulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase vivo. propose Mck1p, addition phosphorylating target proteins, also acts separate, novel mechanism: autophosphorylated Mck1p binds directly inhibits, phosphorylate, catalytic subunits cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
