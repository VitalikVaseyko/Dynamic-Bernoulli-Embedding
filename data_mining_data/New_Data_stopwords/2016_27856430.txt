 Angiogenesis energy-demanding process; however, role cellular energy pathways regulation extracellular stimuli, especially extracellular nucleotides, remain largely unexplored. Using metabolic inhibitors glycolysis (2-deoxyglucose) oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (oligomycin, rotenone, FCCP), demonstrate glycolysis OXPHOS essential angiogenic responses vasa vasorum endothelial cell (VVEC). Treatment P2R agonists, ATP, 2-methylthioadenosine diphosphate trisodium salt (MeSADP), P1 receptor agonist, adenosine, increased glycolytic activity VVEC (measured extracellular acidification rate lactate production). Stimulation glycolysis accompanied increased levels phospho-phosphofructokinase B3, hexokinase (HK), GLUT-1, lactate dehydrogenase. Moreover, extracellular ATP MeSADP, lesser extent adenosine, increased basal maximal oxygen consumption rates VVEC. effects potentiated cells cultured 20 mM galactose 5 mM glucose compared 25 mM glucose. Treatment P2R agonists decreased phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E1alpha increased succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochrome oxidase IV, beta-subunit F1F0 ATP synthase expression. addition, P2R stimulation transiently elevated mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration, implying involvement mitochondria VVEC angiogenic activation. also demonstrated critical role phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt pathways lactate production, PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation, expression HK, SDH, GLUT-1 ATP-stimulated VVEC. Together, findings suggest purinergic metabolic regulation VVEC energy pathways essential VV angiogenesis may contribute pathologic vascular remodeling pulmonary hypertension.
