 Streptococcus suis important swine pathogen responsible diverse group diseases. Studies vaccines focused S. suis serotype 2 strains, invasive isolates worldwide. However, China S. suis serotype 9 (SS9) also prevalent serotype, frequently isolated diseased pigs. Little known immunogenic proteins SS9. Therefore, immunoproteomic-based approach developed identify immunogenic proteins SS9. Cell wall proteins extracted SS9 strain GZ0565 isolated diseased pig meningitis screened two-dimensional Western blotting using anti-SS9 sera pooled specific pathogen-free mice. Protein spots excised preparative gels identified matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS (MALDI-TOF-MS) MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS, led identification eight immunogenic proteins (arginine deiminase, extracellular solute-binding protein, translation elongation factor Ts, neprilysin, peptide ATP-binding cassette transporter peptide-binding protein, pyruvate kinase, phosphate acetyltransferase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase). immunogenic proteins, encoded genes reasonably conserved among SS9 strains, could developed vaccine candidates.
