 Dietary fat plays major role obesity, lipid metabolism, cardiovascular diseases. determine whether intake different types dietary fats affect muscle fiber types govern metabolic contractile properties skeletal muscle, fed male Wistar rats 15% fat diet derived different fat sources. Diets composed soybean oil (n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-rich), fish oil (n-3 PUFA-rich), lard (low PUFAs) administered rats 4 weeks. Myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms used biomarkers delineate skeletal muscle fiber types. Compared soybean oil intake, fish oil intake showed significantly lower levels fast-type MyHC2B higher levels intermediate-type MyHC2X composition extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, fast-type dominant muscle. Concomitantly, MyHC2X mRNA levels fish oil-fed rats significantly higher observed soybean oil-fed rats. MyHC isoform composition lard-fed rats intermediate fish oil soybean oil-fed rats. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, porin mRNA showed significantly upregulated levels EDL fish oil-fed rats compared observed soybean oil-fed lard-fed rats, implying activation oxidative metabolism. contrast, changes composition MyHC isoforms observed soleus muscle, slow-type dominant muscle. Fatty acid composition serum muscle significantly influenced type dietary fat consumed. conclusion, dietary fat affects expression genes related contractile metabolic properties fast-type dominant skeletal muscle, activation oxidative metabolism pronounced fish oil intake soybean oil intake.
