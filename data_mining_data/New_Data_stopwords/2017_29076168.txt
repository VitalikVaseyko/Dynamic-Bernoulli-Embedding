 Cation antiporters NHX family widely regarded determinants salt tolerance due capacity drive sodium (Na) sequester vacuoles. Recent work shows, however, NHX transporters primarily involved vacuolar potassium (K) storage. Over-expression K/H antiporter AtNHX1 tomato increases K accumulation vacuoles plant sensitivity K deprivation. show appearance early leaf symptoms K deficiency associated higher concentration polyamines. Transgenic roots exhibited greater sensitivity shoots K deprivation changes composition free amino acids pool, total sugars organic acids. Concentrations amides (glutamine), amino acids (arginine) sugars significantly increased root, together reduction malate succinate concentrations. concentration pyruvate activity pyruvate kinase greater transgenic roots K withdrawal although parameters depressed K deprivation approached wild-type levels. longer term, over-expression NHX1 antiporter affected root growth biomass partitioning (shoot/root ratio). Greater ethylene release produced longer stem internodes leaf curling transgenic line. data show enhanced sequestration K NHX antiporter vacuoles altered cellular K homeostasis deeper physiological consequences expected. Early metabolic changes lead later profound morphological physiological adjustments resulting eventually loss nutrient use efficiency.
