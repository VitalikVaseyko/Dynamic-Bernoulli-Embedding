 important functional structural properties enzymes affected temperature. order maintain critical enzymic properties regulatory sensitivity, catalytic potential structural stability, significant changes made enzymes evolution different thermal regimes. Regulatory function, typified substrate binding ability, especially conservative. given enzyme, substrate binding ability maintained relatively stable level entire temperature range experienced organism (enzyme), spite wide variation substrate affinity temperatures outside biological range. Similarities substrate affinity among homologues analogues enzymes bacteria, invertebrates, fishes mammals, respective physiological temperatures enzymes, demonstrate crucial importance regulatory abilities enzymes. Two facts, (a) enzymes function sub-maximal rates, (b) low temperature compensation effected wholesale reductions apparent Km values, argue regulation outweighs sheer catalytic potential enzymic function. efficiency enzyme catalyze reaction rapid rate appears highest low cell-temperature forms. finding catalytic efficiency inversely correlated enzymic heat stability suggests enzymes relatively great abilities undergo conformational changes catalysis capable supplying energy activation events, energy arising part exergonic formation weak bonds activation step catalysis. Energy changes due conformational changes may also used reduce net enthalpy change occurs ligand binding, mechanism refer "coupled-compensating enthalpy changes." Comparisons amino acid compositions enzyme homologues analogues differently thermally adapted species reveal major differences, example, overall hydrophobicity enzymes. propose observed differences enzyme thermal stability derive quantitative differences, i.e., differences total numbers secondary interactions, quilitative differences, i.e., differences relative importance different classes weak bonds.
