 Dichloroacetate (DCA) administered orally normal (nondiabetic) streptozotocin-diabetic rats dose 1000 mg/day/kg rat wt. One group diabetic animals received DCA orally intraperitoneally. DCA therapy lowered blood glucose values diabetic animals alter values nondiabetic rats. hepatic activity glucokinase pyruvate kinase significantly lower DCA-treated nondiabetic DCA-treated diabetic animals values observed untreated animals. However, DCA therapy accompanied remarkable increases activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase malic enzyme nondiabetic diabetic animals. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3-fold higher DCA-treated nondiabetic animals whereas malic enzyme activity 10-fold higher treated animals observed untreated animals. Similar changes, although smaller magnitude, observed enzymes DCA-treated diabetic animals. Although DCA therapy accompanied significant increase wet weights liver nondiabetic diabetic animals, morphological changes seen light electron microscopy. observations coupled previous investigators suggest DCA therapy may important role pyruvate metabolism may lower blood glucose concentration inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis.
