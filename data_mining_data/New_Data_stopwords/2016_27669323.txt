 Cancer cells often dysregulated metabolism, largely characterized Warburg effect-an increase glycolytic activity expense oxidative phosphorylation-and increased glutamine utilization. Modern metabolomics tools offer efficient means investigate metabolism cancer cells. Currently, number protocols described harvesting adherent cells metabolomics analysis, techniques vary greatly lack specificity particular cancer cell lines diverse metabolic structural features. present optimized method untargeted metabolomics characterization MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells, commonly used study metastatic breast cancer. found approach extracted metabolites single step within culture dish optimally detected polar non-polar metabolite classes higher relative abundance methods involved removal cells dish. show method highly suited diverse applications, including characterization central metabolic flux stable isotope labelling differential analysis cells subjected specific pharmacological interventions.
