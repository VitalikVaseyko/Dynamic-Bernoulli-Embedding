 cellular distribution hexokinase isoenzymes, N-acetylglucosamine Kinase pyruvate kinases rat liver studied. Hepatocytes non-parenchymal cells high viability almost cross-contamination obtained perfusion situ liver collagenase, use enriched cell-culture medium steps cell isolation. Separation hexokinase isoenzymes done DEAE-cellulose chromatography, enzyme activities measured specific radioassay. Cytosol isolated hepatocytes contained high-affinity hexokinases A, B C, addition hexokinase D. last-mentioned represented 95% total glucose-phosphorylating activity. hexokinase found associated particulate fraction. Isolated non-parenchymal cells contained hexokinases A, B C. N-Acetylglucosamine kinase measured specific radioassay found single enzyme form hepatocytes non-parenchymal cells, higher activities former. Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme L present hepatocytes isoenzyme K non-parenchymal liver cells, confirming good cellular markers.
