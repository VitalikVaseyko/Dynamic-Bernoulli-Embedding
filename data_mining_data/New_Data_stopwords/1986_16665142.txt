 Autoradiography total soluble maize (Zea mays) leaf proteins incubated (32)P-labeled adenylates separated denaturing electrophoresis revealed many polypeptides phosphorylated vitro endogenous protein kinase(s). intense band 94 100 kilodaltons observed using either [gamma-(32)P]ATP [beta-(32)P]ADP phosphate donor. band comprised subunits pyruvate, Pi dikinase (PPDK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase). PPDK activity previously shown dark/light-regulated via novel ADP-dependent phosphorylation/Pi-dependent dephosphorylation threonyl residue. identity acid-stable 94 100 kilodalton band phosphorylated ATP established unequivocally PEPCase two-dimensional gel electrophoresis immunoblotting. phosphorylated amino acid serine residue, determined two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis. vitro phosphorylation PEPCase illuminated maize leaves endogenous protein kinase resulted partial inactivation ( approximately 25%) enzyme assayed pH 7 subsaturating levels PEP, effector modulation l-malate glucose-6-phosphate relatively unaffected. Changes aggregation state maize PEPCase (homotetrameric native structure) studied nondenaturing electrophoresis immunoblotting. Enzyme leaves illuminated plants dissociated upon dilution, whereas protein darkened tissue dissociate, thus indicating physical difference enzyme light- versus dark-adapted maize plants.
