 Chromogranin (CHGA/Chga), proprotein, widely distributed endocrine neuroendocrine tissues (not expressed muscle, liver, adipose tissues), generates least four bioactive peptides. One peptides, pancreastatin (PST), reported interfere insulin action. generated Chga knock-out (KO) mouse targeted deletion Chga gene neuroendocrine tissues. KO mice displayed hypertension, higher plasma catecholamine, adipokine levels lower IL-6 lipid levels compared wild type mice. Liver glycogen content elevated, nitric oxide (NO) level diminished. Glucose, insulin, pyruvate tolerance tests hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies established increased insulin sensitivity liver decreased glucose disposal muscle. Despite higher catecholamine ketone body levels muscle insulin resistance, KO mice maintained euglycemia due increased liver insulin sensitivity. Suppressed mRNA abundance phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) KO mice support conclusion. PST administration KO mice stimulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase G6Pase mRNA abundance raised blood glucose level. liver cells transfected G6Pase promoter, PST caused transcriptional activation protein kinase C (PKC)- synthase-dependent manner. Thus, PST action may mediated suppressing IRS1/2-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-FOXO-1 signaling insulin-induced maturation SREBP1c PKC high level NO. combined effects conventional PKC endothelial synthase activation PST suppress insulin signaling. rise blood PST level age diabetes suggests PST negative regulator insulin sensitivity glucose homeostasis.
