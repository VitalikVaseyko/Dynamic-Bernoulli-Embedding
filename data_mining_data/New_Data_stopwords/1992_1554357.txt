 1. effects purified diets containing 70% glucose 70% fructose activation state hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa), activity mitochondrial PDH kinase, plasma triacylglycerols (TG) hepatic lipogenesis de novo rats measured. 2. Plasma TG significantly increased fructose-fed compared glucose-fed group (125 +/- 45 mg/dl versus 57 +/- 19 mg/dl; P less 0.002) 3-5 weeks diet despite less daily food intake. 3. Hepatic PDHa fructose-fed rats 144% value glucose-fed rats (15.4 +/- 1.2% versus 10.7 +/- 0.5%; P less 0.002), whereas cardiac muscle PDHa different (45.5 +/- 6.6% versus 41.0 +/- 7.8%). 4. Intrinsic hepatic PDH kinase activity decreased 34% glucose-fed values fructose feeding (-k = 3.56 +/- 0.39 versus 10.41 +/- 1.85 min-1; P less 0.005). 5. fractional contribution very-low-density-lipoprotein palmitate hepatic lipogenesis de novo, measured stable-isotope mass-spectrometric method, 10.49 +/- 2.42% (n = 8) fructose-fed rats versus 5.55 +/- 1.38% (n = 9) glucose-fed rats (P less 0.05), 2.66 +/- 2.39% (n = 3) chow-fed rats (P less 0.05 versus fructose-fed group). absolute contribution circulating TG lipogenesis de novo also significantly higher fructose-fed glucose-fed group (14.9 +/- 5.1 mg/dl versus 2.9 +/- 0.6 mg/dl; P less 0.05) 6. Portal insulin concentrations significantly higher fructose-fed rats (206 +/- 49 mu-units/ml versus 81 +/- 15 mu-units/ml; P less 0.05). 7. conclusion, dietary fructose appears specific activating effect hepatic PDH, mediated least part inhibition PDH kinase. results consistent increased flux hepatic PDH synthesis new fat, increased re-esterification non-esterified fatty acids.
