 developed new convenient method determination magnesium ion concentrations use magnesium ion-dependent enzymes; pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. method based determination reaction rate pyruvate kinase uses MgADP- substrate. reaction rate pyruvate kinase dependent upon formation complex ADP magnesium ion amount complex dependent upon magnesium ion. reaction rate pyruvate kinase easily spectrophotometrically determined using lactate dehydrogenase NADH decreased amount absorbance 340 nm.
