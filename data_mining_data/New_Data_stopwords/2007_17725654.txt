 IA-2 major autoantigen type 1 diabetes autoantibodies become important diagnostic predictive markers. IA-2 also intrinsic transmembrane component dense core secretory vesicles knock-out studies showed IA-2 regulator insulin secretion. show overexpression IA-2 puts mouse insulinoma MIN-6 beta cells pre-apoptotic state exposure high glucose results G2/M arrest apoptosis. Molecular study revealed decrease phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK)-1 Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation. Treatment IA-2-transfected cells IA-2 siRNA prevented G2/M arrest apoptosis increased Akt/PKB phosphorylation. search IA-2 interacting proteins revealed IA-2 interacts sorting nexin (SNX)19 SNX19, IA-2, inhibits conversion PtdIns(4,5)P2 PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 thereby suppresses phosphorylation proteins Akt signalling pathway resulting apoptosis. conclude IA-2 acts SNX19 initiate pre-apoptotic state. findings point possibility autoimmune diseases, tissue destruction may autoantigen-induced, necessarily immunologically mediated.
