 tested hypothesis nutritional state affects seawater acclimation transferring either fed food-deprived (2 weeks) male tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) fresh water full-strength sea water. Food-deprivation resulted significant increase plasma concentrations Na+, Cl-, cortisol, glucose, total amino acid, glutamate, serine alanine, hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, whereas prolactin-188 prolactin-177 ratio (tPRL188:tPRL177) plasma prolactin-188 (tPRL188), lactate, arginine hepatic glycogen content hepatic alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) 3-hydroxyacyl-Coenzyme dehydrogenase (HOAD) activities lower fed group. Seawater transfer significantly increased tPRL188:tPRL177 ratio plasma concentrations Na+, Cl-, K+, growth hormone (GH), glucose, aspartate, tyrosine, alanine, methionine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine valine levels well gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity hepatic PK LDH activities, whereas plasma tPRL177, tPRL188, glycine lysine concentrations significantly lower fish retained fresh water. significant interaction nutritional state salinity affected tPRL188:tPRL177 ratio plasma concentrations Cl-, GH, glucose, aspartate, tyrosine, serine, alanine, glycine, arginine hepatic PK, LDH, AlaAT, aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase HOAD activities. results, taken together, indicate food-deprived fish regulate plasma Cl- levels, despite enhancement plasma hormonal metabolic responses sea water. study also suggests possibility plasma prolactin essential amino acids may playing important role seawater acclimation process tilapia.
