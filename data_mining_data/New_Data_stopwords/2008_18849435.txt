 transcriptional regulator SugR Corynebacterium glutamicum represses genes phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). Growth experiments revealed overexpression sugR perturbed growth C. glutamicum PTS sugars glucose, fructose, sucrose also led significant growth inhibition ribose, taken via PTS. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined DNA microarray analysis gel retardation experiments performed identify target genes SugR. Gel retardation analysis confirmed SugR bound promoter regions genes glycolytic enzymes 6-phosphofructokinase (pfkA), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (fba), enolase (eno), pyruvate kinase (pyk), NAD-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA). deletion sugR resulted increased mRNA levels eno, pyk, ldhA acetate medium. Enzyme activity measurements revealed SugR-mediated repression affects activities PfkA, Fba, LdhA vivo. deletion sugR led increased LdhA activity aerobic oxygen deprivation conditions, L-lactate production C. glutamicum determined. overexpression sugR reduced L-lactate production 25%, sugR deletion increased L-lactate formation oxygen deprivation conditions threefold. Thus, SugR functions global repressor genes PTS, glycolysis, fermentative L-lactate dehydrogenase C. glutamicum.
