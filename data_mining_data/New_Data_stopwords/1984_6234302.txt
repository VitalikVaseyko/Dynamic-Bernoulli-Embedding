 Production [14C]glucose [14C]lactate perfused livers 24-h fasted adrenalectomized rats stimulated 1 nM glucagon significantly increased 10 nM hormone. Crossover analysis glycolytic intermediates livers revealed significant reduction glucagon action site(s) fructose 6-phosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate result adrenalectomy. Site(s) pyruvate P-enolpyruvate affected. isolated hepatocytes, adrenalectomy reduced glucagon response gluconeogenesis affecting glucagon inactivation pyruvate kinase. distinct lack glucagon action 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity noted cells. hepatocytes incubated 30 mM glucose, lactate gluconeogenesis greatly stimulated glucagon. reduction sensitivity responsiveness hormone gluconeogenesis seen adrenalectomized rat. changes well correlated similar impairment glucagon action 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content hepatocytes adrenalectomized rats incubated 30 mM glucose. results suggest adrenalectomy impaired gluconeogenic action glucagon livers fasted rats level regulation 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and/or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content.
