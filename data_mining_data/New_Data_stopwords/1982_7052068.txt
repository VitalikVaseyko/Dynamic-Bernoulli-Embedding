 Hepatocytes isolated preweaned neonatal adult rats maintained primary monolayer culture. Cells preweaned newborns possessed L-type pyruvate kinase, synthesize enzyme. Incubation 48-72 h culture medium supplemented 2 mM-fructose 0.1 microM-insulin induced synthesis L-type pyruvate kinase, judged increased enzyme activity increased incorporation [3H]leucine immunoprecipitable L-type pyruvate kinase. Hepatocytes isolated 48 h-starved adult rats incorporated less [3H]leucine L-type pyruvate kinase cells isolated high-carbohydrate-diet-fed rats. rate enzyme synthesis cells 48 h-starved rats increased inclusion fructose insulin incubation medium, lag phase 24-48 h. 4 days culture presence fructose insulin, hepatocytes 48 h-starved rats synthesized L-type pyruvate kinase similar rates hepatocytes isolated high-carbohydrate-diet-fed rats.
