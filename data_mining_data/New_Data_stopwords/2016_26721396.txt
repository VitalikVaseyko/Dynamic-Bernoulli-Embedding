 Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) important regulators Ras activation, instrumental tumor development. However, mechanism underlying regulation remains elusive. demonstrate activated EGFR phosphorylates Y593 residue protein known family sequence similarity 129, member B (FAM129B), overexpressed many types human cancer. FAM129B phosphorylation increased interaction FAM129B Ras, resulting reduced binding p120-RasGAP Ras. FAM129B phosphorylation promoted Ras activation, increasing ERK1/2- PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation leading enhanced glycolytic gene expression Warburg effect; promoting tumor cell proliferation invasion; supporting brain tumorigenesis. studies unearthed novel important mechanism underlying EGFR-mediated Ras activation tumor development.
