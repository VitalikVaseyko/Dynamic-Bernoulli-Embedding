 BACKGROUND: proven miR-133b could inhibit cancer cell growth, expression level miR-133b significant reduction lung cancer tissue serum patients, increase radiation sensitivity squamous cell carcinoma targeting PKM2, exist mechanisms clear. aim study explore effect miR-133b proliferation A549 lung cancer stem cells drug sensitivity DDP, explore relationship miR-133b PKM2 gene, well effect cancer stem cells. METHODS: Using miRBase miRNAMap database sequence comparison miR-133b PKM2 gene. Using immune magnetic separation method select CD133+/CD34+ lung cancer stem cells A549 cells, using flow cytometry detect purity. expression miR-133b mRNA detected real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation detected CCK8 assay. 15 mug/mL DDP treated cells transfected miR-133b, apoptosis detected flow Cytometry 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h. expression PKM2 protein detected Western blot. RESULTS: Gene binding site report PKM2 gene may target gene miR-133b; results flow cytometry showed purity CD133+/CD34+ stem cells (92.15+/-4.27)%. qRT-PCR results showed compared control group, overexpression miR-133b, miR-133b up-regulated miR-133b regulated miR-133b inhibition (P<0.05). Compared control group, cell proliferation miR-133b mimics group significantly decreased (P<0.05), PKM2 protein levels significantly lower (P<0.05); cell proliferation miR-133b inhibitor group PKM2 level increased (P<0.05). apoptosis miR-133b mimics group significantly higher control group (P<0.05) DDP treatment 12 h. expression PKM2 protein miR-133b mimics+DDP group significantly lower control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression miR-133b inhibit growth proliferation lung cancer stem cells regulating PKM2, enhance sensitivity lung cancer stem cells DDP.
