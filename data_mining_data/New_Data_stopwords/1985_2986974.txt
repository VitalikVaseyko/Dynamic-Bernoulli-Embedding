 effects polyamines oligomeric forms protein phosphatase-1 (1G), protein phosphatase-2A (2A0, 2A1 2A2) free catalytic subunits (1C 2AC) studied using homogeneous enzymes isolated rabbit skeletal muscle. Spermine increased activity protein phosphatase-2A towards eight nine substrates tested. Half-maximal activation observed 0.2 mM optimal effects 1-2 mM. 2 mM, spermine became inhibitory. impressive activation protein phosphatase-2A obtained glycogen synthase, especially phosphorylated sites-3 (8-15-fold protein phosphatase-2A1) phenylalanine hydroxylase (6-7-fold protein phosphatase-2A1) substrates. Activation protein phosphatases 2A0, 2A1 2A2 greater observed 2AC. Spermine potent activator spermidine, putrescine small effect. Qualitatively similar results obtained five substrates, although maximal activation much less (1.3-3-fold protein phosphatase-2A1). rate dephosphorylation glycogen phosphorylase decreased spermine, inhibition pronounced protein phosphatase-2AC 2A0, 2A1 2A2. Spermine (I50 = 0.1 mM protein phosphatase-2AC) potent inhibitor spermidine (I50 = 0.9 mM) putrescine (I50 = 8 mM). Partially purified preparations protein phosphatases-2A0, 2A1 2A2 rat liver affected spermine similar manner homogeneous enzymes rabbit skeletal muscle. Spermine activate protein phosphatase-1 extent protein phosphatase-2A. Greatest stimulation (2.5-fold) observed glycogen synthase labelled sites-3, half-maximal activation 0.2 mM optimal effects 1-2 mM spermine. Spermine much effective stimulator spermidine, putrescine ineffective. similar results obtained protein phosphatases 1G 1C. four substrates maximal activation spermine less 1.5-fold, dephosphorylation glycogen synthase (labelled site-2), phosphorylase kinase, pyruvate kinase glycogen phosphorylase inhibited. Spermine (I50 = 0.04 mM) potent inhibitor dephosphorylation glycogen phosphorylase spermidine (I50 = 0.9 mM) putrescine (I50 = 9 mM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
