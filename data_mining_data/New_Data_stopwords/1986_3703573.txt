 shown pyruvate kinase (PK) supernatant fraction Calicophoron ijimai able regulate direction metabolic flow glucose break phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) level. enzyme activity required substrate, dinucleotides, cations K+ Mn++. activity Mg++ divalent cation low. addition fructose-1.6-diphosphate (FDP) affect enzyme activity Mn++, however, increased affinity PEP. velocity Mg++ activated reaction increased 8.2 times presence FDP. PK C. ijimai sensitive ATP inhibition, weakly inhibited malate. L-alanine influence enzyme activity. effect anthelminthic preparations PK activity shown.
