 copper-based drug Casiopeina II-gly (CasII-gly) shows potent antineoplastic effect diminishes mitochondrial metabolism several human rodent malignant tumors. elucidate whether CasII-gly also affects glycolysis, (a) flux complete pathway initial segment (b) activities several glycolytic enzymes AS-30D hepatocarcinoma cells determined. CasII-gly (IC(5)(0) = 0.74-6.7 muM) effective inhibit 24-72 h growth several human carcinomas 3-bromopyruvate (3BrPyr) (IC(5)(0) = 45-100 muM) apparent effect normal human-proliferating lymphocytes HUVECs. short-term 60-min experiments, CasII-gly increased tumor cell lactate production glycogen breakdown. CasII-gly 1.3-21 times potent 3BrPyr cisplatin inhibit tumor HK. CasII-gly inhibited soluble mitochondrial HK activities flux HK-TPI glycolytic segment, whereas PFK-1, GAPDH, PGK, PYK activities HPI-TPI segment flux affected, data suggested glycogenolysis activation induced HK inhibition. Accordingly, glycogen-depleted well oligomycin-treated cancer cells became sensitive CasII-gly. inhibition time-course HK CasII-gly slower OxPhos AS-30D cells, indicating glycolytic toxicity secondary mitochondria, primary CasII-gly target. long-term 24-h experiments HeLa cells, 5 muM CasII-gly inhibited OxPhos (80%), glycolysis (40%), HK (42%). present data indicated CasII-gly effective multisite anticancer drug simultaneously targeting mitochondria glycolysis.
