 CONTEXT: Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. (Asteraceae) extract (CME) possesses vasodilator effect vitro. However, use polyphenol-rich CME treatment hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy reported. OBJECTIVE: investigated effect polyphenol-rich CME hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy rats possible mechanism action. MATERIALS METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rat model cardiac hypertrophy induced renovascular hypertension. blood pressure, cardiac weight index, free fatty acids (FFA) serum myocardium, protein expressions myocardial hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) measured treating hypertensive rats polyphenol-rich CME anthodia 75-150 mg/kg daily 4 weeks. myocardial histological examination also conducted. RESULTS: CME treatment, blood pressure, cardiac weight cardiac weight index decreased 5.7-9.6%, 9.2-18.4% 10.9-20.1%, respectively, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area also decreased 8.3-30.4%. CME treatment simultaneously decreased FFA serum myocardium protein expressions myocardial HIF-1alpha GLUT-4, increased protein expressions myocardial PPARalpha, CPT-1a PDK-4, especially CME 150 mg/kg group (p < 0.05 p < 0.01). DISCUSSION CONCLUSION: Polyphenol-rich CME may alleviate hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy rats. mechanisms may related reduction blood pressure amelioration myocardial energy metabolism. latter may attributed inhibition HIF-1alpha expression subsequent modulation PPARalpha-mediated CPT-1a, PDK-4 GLUT-4 expressions.
