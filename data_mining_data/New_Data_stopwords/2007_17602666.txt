 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDHK2) unique mitochondrial protein kinase regulates activity pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDC). PDHK2 integral component PDC tightly bound inner lipoyl-bearing domains (L2) dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component (E2) PDC. association reported bring 10-fold increase kinase activity. Despite central role played E2 maintenance PDHK2 functionality PDC-bound state, molecular mechanisms responsible recognition L2 PDHK2 E2-dependent PDHK2 activation largely unknown. study, used combination molecular modeling site-directed mutagenesis identify amino acid residues essential interaction PDHK2 L2 activation PDHK2 E2. basis results site-directed mutagenesis, appears number PDHK2 residues located R domain (P22, L23, F28, F31, F44, L45, L160) so-called "cross arm" structure (K368, R372, K391) critical determining strength interaction PDHK2 L2. residues L2 essential recognition PDHK2 include L140, K173, I176, E179, lesser extent D164, D172, A174. Importantly, certain PDHK2 residues forming interfaces L2, i.e., K17, P22, F31, F44, R372, K391, also critical maintenance enhanced PDHK2 activity E2-bound state. Finally, evidence blood glucose-lowering compound AZD7545 disrupts interactions PDHK2 L2 thereby inhibits PDHK2 activity presented.
