 BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein (ApoM) constituent high-density lipoproteins (HDL). plays crucial role HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport. Insulin resistance associated decreased ApoM levels. AIMS: assess effects increased free fatty acids (FFAs) levels short-term Intralipid infusion insulin sensitivity hepatic ApoM gene expression. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats infused 20% Intralipid solution 6 h. Glucose infusion rates (GIR) determined hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp Intralipid infusion plasma FFA levels measured colorimetry. Rats sacrificed Intralipid treatment livers sampled. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells transfected lentivirus mediated human apoM overexpression system. Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats injected lentiviral vector insulin tolerance assessed. Gene expression assessed real-time RT-PCR PCR array. RESULTS: Intralipid increased FFAs 17.6 folds GIR decreased 27.1% compared control group. ApoM gene expression decreased 40.4% Intralipid infusion. PPARbeta/delta expression changed Intralipid. Whereas mRNA levels Acaca, Acox1, Akt1, V-raf murine sarcoma 3611 viral oncogene homolog, G6pc, Irs2, Ldlr, Map2k1, pyruvate kinase RBC significantly increased rat liver Intralipid infusion. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) significantly down-regulated 293T cells overexpressing ApoM. Overexpression human ApoM GK rats could enhance glucose-lowering effect exogenous insulin. CONCLUSION: results suggest Intralipid could decrease hepatic ApoM levels. ApoM overexpression may potential role improving insulin resistance vivo modulating apoM expression might future therapeutic strategy insulin resistance type 2 diabetes.
