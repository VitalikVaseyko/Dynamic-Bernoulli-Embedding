 Seedlings castor bean (Ricinus communis cv. Hale) exposed gibberellin A(3) (GA(3)) (100 micromolar) periods 20 hours. Endosperm homogenates fractionated linear sucrose gradients enzymes mitochondria, glyoxysome, cytosol fractions assayed. Gibberellin treatment resulted increases activities enzymes three compartments. also enzymes three compartments affected exogenous applications GA(3). isozymes l-asparate-alpha-ketoglutarate aminotransferase mitochondria glyoxysomes induced coordinately, whereas isozymes citrate synthase malate dehydrogenase not. gluconeogenic enzymes glyoxysomes induced GA(3). exception mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase isozyme, enzymes tricarboxylic acid cycle believed participate glyconeogenesis increased. cytosolic enzymes malate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose bisphosphatase induced, levels pyruvate kinase enolase affected GA(3) treatment.
