 Heterogeneous clinical features inherited hemolytic anemia due pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency observed three related homozygous patients. Erythrocytes separated old young cells means density-layer centrifugation using new supporting medium: Stractan-Urografin gradients. fractions containing older RBC disclosed defective PK resulted impaired metabolism. Following intake chloramphenicol clinical course one female family member converted acute monocytic leukemia. Thus, report PK instability trait, one family member associated pancytopenia converted leukemia, suggests inherited red cell enzyme deficiency might also expression vulnerability hematopoietic stem cells.
