 Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate MRS provides unique imaging opportunity study reaction kinetics enzyme activities vivo metabolism favorable imaging characteristics critical position cellular metabolic pathway, either reduced lactate (reflecting glycolysis) converted acetyl-coenzyme bicarbonate (reflecting oxidative phosphorylation). Cancer tissue metabolism altered way result relative preponderance glycolysis relative oxidative phosphorylation (i.e. Warburg effect). Although strong theoretical basis presuming readjustment metabolic balance towards normal could alter tumor growth, robust noninvasive vivo tool measure balance two metabolic processes yet developed. recently, hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate imaging studies focused solely [1-(13)C]lactate production strong signal. However, without concomitant measure pyruvate entry mitochondria, lactate signal provides information balance glycolytic oxidative metabolic pathways. Consistent measurement (13)C-bicarbonate cancer tissue, provide information, proven difficult, however. study, report reliable measurement (13)C-bicarbonate production healthy brain highly glycolytic experimental glioblastoma model using optimized (13)C MRS imaging protocol. capacity obtain signal tumors, also confirm first time ratio (13)C-lactate (13)C-bicarbonate provides robust metric relative (13)C-lactate assessment metabolic effects anti-angiogenic therapy. data suggest potential application ratio early biomarker assess therapeutic effectiveness. Furthermore, although study needed, results suggest anti-angiogenic treatment results rapid normalization relative tissue utilization glycolytic oxidative phosphorylation tumor tissue.
