 effect insulin hepatic glucose production studied anesthetized rats postabsorptive state. Insulin decreases significantly hepatic glucose production within 5-10 min. also increases level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, via increase Vmax 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase concomitantly decreased activity fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, resulting 5-fold increase ratio kinase/phosphatase. Insulin also increased apparent Kd pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate. changes activity 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase pyruvate kinase measured separation possible modulators, suggest decrease phosphorylation state cannot attributed decrease level cAMP activity cAMP-dependent protein kinase since two parameters modified insulin. addition, neither activity phosphorylase glycogen synthase modified. data strongly suggest increase glycolytic rate plays role effect insulin hepatic glucose production insulin mediates effect activity enzymes via one phosphatases.
