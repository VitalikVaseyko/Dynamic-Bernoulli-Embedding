 Oil palm accumulate 90% oil mesocarp, highest level observed plant kingdom. contrast, closely related date palm accumulates almost exclusively sugars. gain insight mechanisms lead extreme difference carbon partitioning, transcriptome metabolite content oil palm date palm compared mesocarp development. Compared date palm, high oil content oil palm associated much higher transcript levels fatty acid synthesis enzymes, specific plastid transporters, key enzymes plastidial carbon metabolism, including phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase. Transcripts representing ortholog WRI1 transcription factor 57-fold higher oil palm relative date palm displayed temporal pattern similar target genes. Unexpectedly, despite 100-fold difference flux lipids, enzymes triacylglycerol assembly expressed similar levels oil palm date palm. Similarly, transcript levels one cytosolic enzyme glycolysis comparable species. Together, data point synthesis fatty acids supply pyruvate plastid, rather acyl assembly triacylglycerol, major control storage oil mesocarp oil palm. addition greatly increasing molecular resources devoted oil palm date palm, combination temporal comparative studies illustrates deep sequencing provide insights gene expression patterns two species lack genome sequence information.
