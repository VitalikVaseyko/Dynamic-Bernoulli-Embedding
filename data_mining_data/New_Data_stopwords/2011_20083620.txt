 AIMS: Insulin-dependent positive inotropic effects (PIE) partially Ca(2+) independent. mechanism potentially glucose dependent. contrast animal species, human myocardium expresses high levels sodium-glucose-transporter-1 (SGLT-1) mRNA besides common glucose-transporters-1 -4 (GLUT1, GLUT4). METHODS RESULTS: used ventricular myocardium 61 end-stage failing human hearts (ischaemic cardiomyopathy, ICM dilated cardiomyopathy, DCM) 13 non-failing donor hearts. effect insulin isometric twitch force examined without blocking PI3-kinase, GLUT4-translocation, SGLT-1. Substrate-dependent (glucose vs. pyruvate vs. palmitoyl-carnitine) effects tested atrial myocardium. mRNA expression glucose transporters analysed. Insulin increased developed force 122 + - 7.4, 121.7 + - 2.5, 134.1 + - 5.7% non-failing, DCM, ICM (P < 0.05 vs. DCM), respectively. Positive inotropic effect partially blunted inhibition PI-3-kinase, GLUT4, SGLT1. Combined inhibition PI3-kinase glucose-transport completely abolished PIE. Positive inotropic effect significantly stronger glucose-containing solution compared pyruvate palmitoyl-carnitine containing. mRNA expression showed tendency towards elevated GLUT4-expression ICM. CONCLUSIONS: Positive inotropic effect insulin pronounced ICM, underlying mechanisms unaltered. Ca(2+)-independent PIE insulin mediated via glucose-transporters. Together Ca(2+)-dependent PI-3-kinase mediated pathway, responsible entire PIE. Substrate-dependency affirms glucose-dependent part PIE.
