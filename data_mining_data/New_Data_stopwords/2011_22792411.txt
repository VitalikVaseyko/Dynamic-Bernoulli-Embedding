 One common profound biochemical phenotypes animal human cancer cells ability metabolize glucose high rates, even aerobic conditions. alterations lead establishment tumor-specific metabolic machinery sufficient supporting biosynthetic energy requirements tumor cells facilitating rapid tumor growth adaptation new metastatic niches. changes entail rapid glycolysis tumor cells, shifting flux glucose tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle glycolysis, resulting generation vast amounts lactate, secreted outside tumor cells. phenomenon also termed Warburg effect, originally described Otto Warburg. Several oncogenes tumor suppressors implicated altering tumor cell metabolism order facilitate tumor growth metastasis. MicroRNAs mediate fine-tuning cancerassociated glycolytic pathways either directly level oncogenes. article intends review mechanisms pathways miRNAs regulate aerobic glycolysis cancer.
