 RBCs patients hemolytic anemia due pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency characterized decreased total adenine pyridine nucleotide content. phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) precursor adenine pyridine nucleotides, investigated ability intact PK-deficient RBCs accumulate PRPP. rate PRPP formation normal RBCs (n = 11) 2.89 +/- 0.80 nmol/min.mL RBCs. contrast, rate PRPP formation PK-deficient RBCs (n = 4) markedly impaired 1.03 +/- 0.39 nmol/min.mL RBCs. Impaired PRPP formation cells due higher proportion reticulocytes. study mechanism impaired PRPP formation, PK deficiency simulated incubating normal RBCs fluoride. normal RBCs, fluoride inhibited PRPP formation, caused adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, prevented 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) depletion, inhibited pentose phosphate shunt (PPS) activity. results together data suggest impaired PRPP formation mediated changes ATP DPG concentration, lead decreased PPS perhaps decreased hexokinase PRPP synthetase activities. Impaired PRPP formation may mechanism decreased adenine pyridine nucleotide content PK-deficient RBCs.
