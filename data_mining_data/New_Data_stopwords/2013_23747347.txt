 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) considered key checkpoint ensure energy balance cells organisms. AMPK alphabetagamma heterotrimer controlled allosteric regulation AMP, ADP ATP, auto-inhibitory features phosphorylation, threonine-172 phosphorylation catalytic alpha-subunit LKB1, CaMKKbeta Tak1 essential fully activation. AMPK acts protective response energy stress numerous systems, also key player diabetes related metabolic diseases cancer. Pharmacological activation AMPK metformin compounds holds considerable potential reverse metabolic abnormalities associated type 2 diabetes. cancer, correction dysregulated metabolic pathway LKB1/AMPK/mTORC1 lower Warburg effect, suggesting AMPK potential target cancer prevention and/or treatment. commentary, review recent findings support role function AMPK normal pathological conditions. also discuss activation AMPK naturally occurring compounds could help prevent development numerous chronic diseases contributing way well-being ageing population.
