 1. glycolytic flow skeletal muscle considerably depressed hibernation Jaculus orientalis. 2. Although ATP content modified, ATP/AMP ratio twice large homeothermic conditions. 3. Furthermore, hexose phosphates markedly depressed. 4. total activities key enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, regulated adenylates, decreased. 5. vivo conditions, taking account small amount fructose-6-phosphate ATP/AMP ratio, likely phosphofructokinase totally inhibited, explaining undetectable amount fructose 1.6 bisphosphate.
