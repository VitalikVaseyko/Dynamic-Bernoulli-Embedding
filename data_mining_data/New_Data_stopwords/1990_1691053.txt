 Phenotypically altered liver foci produced female Wistar rats single dose N-nitrosomorpholine followed promotion phenobarbital (PB) 20 28 weeks. treatment changed either hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), cyproterone acetate (CPA), nafenopin (Naf) clofibrate (Clof), two hypolipidemic drugs. Foci identified positive reaction gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) cytological markers. HCH CPA could substitute PB foci promoters; contrast, Naf Clof decreased expression GGT foci resulting decline number area detectable foci, effects particularly pronounced Naf. Immunohistochemical investigations serial sections revealed Naf also reduced expression altered phenotype cytochrome P450-PB pyruvate kinase (type L) used foci markers, glutathione-S-transferase B (GST-B) used. Thus, number foci enhanced GST-B decline significantly change PB Naf treatment. Furthermore, reduction GGT decrease foci number Naf treatment associated increased evidence cell death apoptosis foci, contrast situation PB withdrawal. findings strongly suggest disappearance GGT-positive foci Naf due phenotypic change resulting suppression GGT expression rather physical elimination foci.
