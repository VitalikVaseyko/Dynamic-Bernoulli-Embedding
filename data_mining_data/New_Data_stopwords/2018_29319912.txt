 Hibernation adaptive strategy mammals use survive highly seasonal unpredictable environments. present first investigation transcriptomics hibernation natural population primate hibernators: Crossley's dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus crossleyi). Using capture-mark-recapture techniques track animals period 7 months Madagascar, used RNA-seq compare gene expression profiles white adipose tissue (WAT) three distinct physiological states. focus pathway analysis assess biological significance transcriptional changes dwarf lemur WAT and, comparing contrasting known model hibernating species, contribute broader understanding genomic contributions hibernation across Mammalia. hibernation signature characterized suppression lipid biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism mitochondrial-associated functions, accumulation transcripts encoding ribosomal components iron-storage proteins. data support key role pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) regulating shift fuel economy periods severe food deprivation. pattern PDK4 holds true across representative hibernating species disparate mammalian groups, suggesting genetic underpinnings hibernation may ancestral mammals.
