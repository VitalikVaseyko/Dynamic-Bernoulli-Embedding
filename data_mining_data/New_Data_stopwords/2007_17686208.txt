 BACKGROUND: caffeine/halothane contracture test North America vitro contracture test Europe currently validated bioassays diagnosing malignant hyperthermia susceptibility phenotyping families. tests invasive requiring surgical muscle biopsy. Here, report first use selective ryanodine receptor type agonist ryanodine percutaneous microdialysis protocol designed test whether microdialysis-induced local metabolic responses skeletal muscle due ryanodine receptor activation differentiate malignant hyperthermia-sensitive normal pigs. METHODS: Six microdialysis catheters implanted percutaneously adductor muscles right left thighs malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (n = 9) normal (n = 8) anaesthetized (ketamine/propofol) mechanically ventilated swine. Systemic blood gases, haemodynamic parameters creatine kinase levels measured before, microdialysis perfusion ryanodine. post-implantation equilibration period 30 min, one catheter perfused (2 micro min-1) 0.9% NaCl (control) compared remaining five catheters perfused increasing concentrations ryanodine (0.2-100 micromol). Lactate pyruvate levels measured enzymatically. RESULTS: Continuous perfusion ryanodine revealed dose-dependent sigmoidal increases dialysate lactate lactate-pyruvate ratio parameters; effects greatly augmented malignant hyperthermia-susceptible pigs compared normal pigs (two- threefold): estimated EC50 greatly decreased (>19-fold) maximum effect increased (>twofold) malignant hyperthermia-susceptible group. CONCLUSION: vivo percutaneous microdialysis protocol skeletal muscle, using ryanodine ryanodine receptor type agonist dialysed lactate-pyruvate parameters metabolic index, reproducibly differentiate malignant hyperthermia-susceptible normal swine.
