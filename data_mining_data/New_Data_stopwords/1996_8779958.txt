 Molybdenum mimics certain insulin actions vitro. investigated effects oral administration Na2MoO4 (Mo) 8 wk carbohydrate lipid metabolism streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Mo decreased hyperglycemia glucosuria 75% corrected elevation plasma nonesterified fatty acids. Tolerance glucose loads improved, glycogen stores replenished. effects due rise insulinemia. liver, Mo restored blunted mRNA activity glucokinase pyruvate kinase decreased normal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase values. Finally, Mo totally reversed low expression activity acetyl-CoA carboxylase fatty acid synthase liver, white adipose tissue. conclusion, Mo exerts marked blood glucose-lowering effect diabetic rats insulin-like action. effect results part restoration hepatic glucose metabolism associated tissue-specific correction lipogenic enzyme gene expression, processes essentially mediated reversal impaired pretranslational regulatory mechanisms. observations raise new therapeutic perspectives diabetes, particularly insulin-resistant condition.
