 study investigated effects fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (CHS) isolated sea cucumber glucose metabolism insulin signaling liver insulin-resistant C57BL/6 mice fed high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFSD). Male C57BL/6J mice randomly assigned six groups: control; HFSD; 1 mg RSG/kg.body weight (RSG); 80 mg CHS/kg . body weight (CHS); 20 mg CHS+1 mg RSG/kg . body weight (20 CHS+RSG); 80 mg CHS+1 mg RSG/kg . body weight (80 CHS+RSG). Blood glucose, insulin parameters, glucose metabolism-related enzymes activities insulin-signaling transducers liver analyzed 19 weeks. Results showed CHS significantly decreased body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, fasting blood glucose serum insulin levels insulin-resistant mice. Rosiglitazone (RSG) effective thiazolidinedione hypoglycemic agent, CHS synergistically enhanced effect RSG. CHS feeding normalized activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, glucose-6-phosphatase, increased glycogen reserves liver. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed CHS promoted mRNA expression insulin receptors (IR), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB), glycogen synthase (GS) liver insulin resistant mice, inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3beta) mRNA expression. results suggested CHS treatment improved glucose metabolism modulating metabolic enzymes promoting PI3K/PKB/GSK-3beta signaling pathway mediated insulin transcriptional level. results provided strong justification development CHS functional food.
