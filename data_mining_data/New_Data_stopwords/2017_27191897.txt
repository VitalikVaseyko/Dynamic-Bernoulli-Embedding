 PURPOSE STUDY: study investigated whether sarpogrelate hydrochloride (SPG), 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, alleviates chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (CH-PH) rats stimulating apoptosis inhibiting proliferation pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). MATERIALS METHODS: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated SPG (50 mg/kg/day oral gavage) saline vehicle subjected chronic hypoxia (CH) (hypobaric chamber set 380 mmHg, 10% oxygen) normoxia 14 days. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) measured. Hypertensive pulmonary vascular remodeling assayed light microscopy. Terminal deoxynucletidyl transferase dUTP nick end ligase (TUNEL) assays, western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction used assess apoptosis, proliferation underlying signaling pathways PASMCs lung tissue isolated pulmonary artery rings. RESULTS: CH increased mean PAP RVH. CH increased percentage muscularized arteries peripheral pulmonary vasculature medial wall thickness small muscular arteries. CH increased pulmonary protein mRNA levels B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), phosphorylation extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 2 (pERK1/2), cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased protein mRNA levels Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), cleaved caspase-3. Pretreatment SPG, shown previously inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation PDK, countered effects. Isolated pulmonary artery rings incubated 5-HT increased pERK1/2, PDK, Bcl-2 expression, decreased Bax expression. CONCLUSION: Administration SPG ameliorated development CH-PH stimulating apoptosis inhibiting proliferation PASMCs.
