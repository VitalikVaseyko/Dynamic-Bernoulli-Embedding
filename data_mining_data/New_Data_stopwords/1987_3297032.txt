 work investigated mechanisms modulation renal hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activities carbohydrate re-feeding 48 h-starved rats, identified regulatory role tri-iodothyronine. Glucose re-feeding decreased blood concentrations lipid fuels euthyroid hyperthyroid rats. treatment associated re-activation hepatic PDH either group rats, renal PDH hyperthyroid rats (where activity already high), increased renal PDH euthyroid rats. Dichloroacetate (DCA), activator PDH kinase, increased renal PDH activities euthyroid rats, hyperthyroid rats, effects glucose re-feeding hyperthyroidism longer apparent. treatments therefore exert effects renal PDH changes PDH kinase. DCA re-activation hepatic PDH marked hyperthyroid euthyroid rats, suggesting that, conditions inhibited kinase activity, PDH phosphatase active livers hyperthyroid rats. limited effect DCA hepatic PDH euthyroid rats potentiated glucose re-feeding insulin, inhibition lipolysis, demonstrating direct effect insulin increase hepatic PDH phosphatase. Glucose re-feeding, inhibition lipolysis insulin administration increase hepatic PDH DCA-treated hyperthyroid rats, indicating effects hyperthyroidism insulin PDH phosphatase additive.
