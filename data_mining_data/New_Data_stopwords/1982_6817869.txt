 liver, L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) considered major isozyme. Using immunocytometric method, demonstrated labeled LPK (LPK+) hepatocytes largely influenced nutritional status Rat, well addition glucagon vitro. fed Rats, percentage LPK-hepatocytes remained stable least 90 min. decreased one half value fasted Rats. Addition glucagon (114 nM) effect fasted Rats, decreased percentage LPK-hepatocytes half fed Rats. concluded neoglucogenesis status (fasting addition glucagon fed Rats liver cells) induced fall percentage LPK-hepatocytes.
