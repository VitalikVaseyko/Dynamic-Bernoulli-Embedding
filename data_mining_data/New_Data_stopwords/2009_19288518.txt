 Retinal ischemia contributes multiple ocular diseases aminoguanidine (AMG) treatment significantly inhibits neuronal vascular degeneration due acute retinal ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. present study, 2-D DIGE applied profile global protein expression changes due retinal I/R injury, protection effects mediated AMG. Retinal ischemia induced elevated intraocular pressure 80-90 mmHg 2 h, reperfusion established afterward. Retinal tissues collected 2 days I/R injury. 2-D DIGE analysis, total 96 proteins identified. Among them, 28 proteins identified within gel spots whose intensities normalized AMG pretreatment, pathway analysis indicated involved glycolysis carbohydrate metabolism. Selected enzymes identified MS/MS within pathways, including transketolase, triosephosphate isomerase 1, aldolase C, total enolase, pyruvate kinase validated quantitative Western blots. Glycolytic enzymes differentially regulated proteins likely play previously unrecognized roles retinal degeneration I/R injury, inhibition resulting metabolic changes, using pharmacologically agents AMG, serve inhibit changes metabolism mitigate retinal degeneration. Select glycolytic enzymes may provide novel therapeutic targets inhibiting neuronal vascular degeneration retinal I/R injury.
