 BACKGROUND: mosquito A. aegypti vector dengue viruses. New methods vector control needed achieved better understanding life cycle insect. Embryogenesis part A. aegypty life cycle poorly understood. insects general mosquitoes particular energetic metabolism well studied oogenesis, oocyte exhibits fast growth, accumulating carbohydrates, lipids proteins meet regulatory metabolic needs developing embryo. hand, events related energetic metabolism A. aegypti embryogenesis unknown. RESULTS: Glucose metabolism investigated throughout Aedes aegypti (Diptera) embryonic development. cellular blastoderm formation (CBf, 5 h egg laying - HAE) germ band retraction (GBr, 24 HAE) may considered landmarks regarding glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) destination. observed high levels glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity beginning embryogenesis, nevertheless decreased 5 HAE. activity correlated need nucleotide precursors generated pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), G6PDH key enzyme. suggest synchronism egg metabolism carbohydrate distribution based decreasing levels phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity elevation observed protein content 24 HAE. Concomitantly, increasing levels hexokinase (HK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activity observed, PEPCK reached peak around 48 HAE. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) activity also monitored shown inversely correlated glycogen distribution embryogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: results herein support hypothesis glucose metabolic fate changes according developmental embryonic stages. Germ band retraction moment characterized landmark glucose metabolism Aedes aegypti embryogenesis. Furthermore, results also suggest role GSK3 glycogen balance/distribution morphological modifications.
