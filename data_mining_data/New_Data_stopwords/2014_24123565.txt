 Reprogramming somatic cells pluripotent state drastically reconfigures cellular anabolic requirements, thus potentially inducing cancer-like metabolic transformation. Accordingly, others previously showed somatic mitochondria bioenergetics extensively remodeled upon derivation induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), cells transit oxidative glycolytic metabolism. attempt identify possible regulatory mechanisms underlying metabolic restructuring, investigated contributing role hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha (HIF1alpha), master regulator energy metabolism, induction maintenance pluripotency. discovered ablation HIF1alpha function dermal fibroblasts dramatically hampers reprogramming efficiency, small molecule-based activation HIF1alpha significantly improves cell fate conversion. Transcriptional bioenergetic analysis reprogramming initiation indicated transduction four factors sufficient upregulate HIF1alpha target pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) one set motion glycolytic shift. However, additional HIF1alpha activation appears critical early upregulation HIF1alpha-associated metabolic regulators, including PDK3 pyruvate kinase (PK) isoform M2 (PKM2), resulting increased glycolysis enhanced reprogramming. Accordingly, elevated levels PDK1, PDK3, PKM2 reduced PK activity could observed iPSCs human embryonic stem cells undifferentiated state. Overall, findings suggest early induction HIF1alpha targets may instrumental iPSC derivation via activation glycolytic program. findings implicate HIF1alpha pathway enabling regulator cellular reprogramming.
