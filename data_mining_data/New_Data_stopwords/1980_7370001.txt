 extent binding glycolytic enzymes particulate fraction homogenates measured bovine psoas muscle electrical stimulation. association accelerated glycolytic rate stimulation, significant increase binding certain glycolytic enzymes, notable phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. known association glycolytic enzymes I-band muscle proposed electrical stimulation anaerobic muscle increases enzyme binding actin filaments. Calculations extent enzyme binding suggest significant amounts enzyme protein, particularly aldolase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, associated actin filaments. results also imply kinetic parameters derived considerations enzyme activity soluble state may direct application situation muscle fibre, particularly accelerated glycolysis.
