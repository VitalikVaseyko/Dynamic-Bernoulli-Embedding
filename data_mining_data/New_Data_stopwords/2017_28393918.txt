 Abnormalities circadian clock system known affect body's metabolic functions, though molecular mechanisms responsible remain uncertain. study, achieved continuous knockdown B. mori Period (BmPer) gene expression B. mori ovary cell line (BmN), generated Per-KD B. mori model developmental disorders including small individual cells slow growth. conducted cell metabolomics assays gas chromatography/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed knockdown BmPer gene expression resulted significant inhibition glycometabolism. Amino acids used glucose metabolites source also down-regulated, lipid metabolism nucleotide metabolism significantly up-regulated. Metabolite correlation analysis showed pyruvate lactate closely related glycometabolism, well metabolites aspartate, alanine, xanthine pathways. validation experiments showed activities key enzymes glucose metabolism, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, citrate synthase, significantly decreased transcription encoding genes, well pyruvate kinase, also significantly down-regulated. concluded inhibition circadian clock gene BmPer repressed glycometabolism, may associated changes cellular amino acid metabolism, cell growth development.
