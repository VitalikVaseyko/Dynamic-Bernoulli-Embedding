 study, examined whether adenoviral-mediated glycerol kinase (AdV-CMV-GlyK) expression isolated rat pancreatic islets could introduce glycerol-induced proinsulin biosynthesis. AdV-CMV-GlyK-infected islets, specific glycerol-induced proinsulin biosynthesis translation insulin secretion observed parallel islets. threshold concentration glycerol required stimulate proinsulin biosynthesis lower (0.25-0.5 mmol/l) insulin secretion (1.0-1.5 mmol/l), reminiscent threshold differences glucose-stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis versus insulin secretion. dose-dependent glycerol-induced proinsulin biosynthesis correlated rate glycerol oxidation AdV-CMV-GlyK-infected islets, indicating glycerol metabolism required response. However, glycerol significantly increase lactate output AdV-CMV-GlyK-infected islets, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) alpha-glycerophosphate (alpha-GP) ratio significantly increased AdV-CMV-GlyK-infected islets incubated 2 mmol/l glycerol compared basal level 2.8 mmol/l glucose (P < = 0.05). DHAP:alpha-GP ratio unaffected AdV-CMV-GlyK-infected islets incubated 2 mmol/l glycerol added presence alpha-cyanohydroxycinnaminic acid (alpha-CHC), inhibitor plasma membrane mitochondrial lactate/pyruvate transporter. However, alpha-CHC inhibited glycerol-induced proinsulin biosynthesis insulin secretion AdV-CMV-GlyK-infected islets (>75%; P = 0.05), similarly glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis insulin secretion AdV-CMV-GlyK-infected control islets. data indicated AdV-CMV-GlyK-infected islets, importance mitochondrial metabolism glycerol required generate stimulus-response coupling signals induce proinsulin biosynthesis insulin secretion.
