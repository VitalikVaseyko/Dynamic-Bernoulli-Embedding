 Resistance chemotherapy crucial problem clinical situation. overcome issue, many mechanisms chemoresistance elucidated far. However, problem still solved completely. study, investigated mechanism chemoresistance view cancer metabolism-related genes, especially focusing expression profile pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms, rate-limiting enzymes cancer-specific metabolism (Warburg effect). Herein, showed PKM1, promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), commonly up-regulated various chemoresistant cells. clarify functions PKM1 chemoresistance, investigated effects PKM1 expression DLD-1 parental, 5-FU-resistant oxaliplatin-resistant DLD-1 cells. overexpression PKM1 resulted resistance parental cells 5-FU oxaliplatin. Moreover, gene-silencing PKM1 induced apoptosis cells including resistant cells causing decrease mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, combination therapy using 5-FU oxaliplatin siR-PKM1 also effective resistant cells. findings lead development new agents cancel chemoresistance view cancer energy metabolism.
