 Activities glycolytic enzymes aorta investigated female Wistar rats. two groups rats; one served control (sedentary rats), group forced run treadmill 10 weeks. control animals, activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase aldolase relatively lower glycolytic enzymes (phosphoglucose isomerase, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase). exercise, activity phosphofructokinase increased 15%, whereas enzymatic activities much controls. Within limits experiments, increased percentage phosphofructokinase statistically significant (p less 0.05). Since phosphofructokinase putative rate limiting enzyme, enzymatic activation may indicate glycolytic activity rat aorta enhanced running exercise.
