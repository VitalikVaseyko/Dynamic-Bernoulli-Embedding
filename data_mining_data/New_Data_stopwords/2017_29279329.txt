 Expression cell surface glycoprotein MHC class polypeptide-related sequence (MICA) induced dangerous, abnormal 'stressed' cells, including cancer cells, virus-infected cells rapidly proliferating cells. MICA recognized activating immune cell receptor NKG2D, providing mechanism immune cells identify potentially eliminate pathological cells. Immune recognition NKG2D implicated cancer, atherosclerosis, transplant rejection inflammatory diseases rheumatoid arthritis. Despite wide range potential therapeutic applications MICA manipulation, factors control MICA expression unclear. use metabolic interventions metabolomic analyses show transition quiescent cellular metabolism 'Warburg' biosynthetic metabolic state induces MICA expression. Specifically, show glucose transport cell active glycolytic metabolism necessary upregulate MICA expression. Active purine synthesis necessary support effect glucose, increases purine nucleotide levels sufficient induce MICA expression. Metabolic induction MICA expression directly influences NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity immune cells. findings support model MICA regulation whereby purine metabolic activity individual cells reflected cell surface MICA expression subject surveillance NKG2D receptor-expressing immune cells.
