 Dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), recently demonstrated promising nontoxic antineoplastic agent promotes apoptosis cancer cells. present study, aimed investigate antitumor effect DCA combined 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Four human CRC cell lines treated DCA 5-FU, combination DCA 5-FU. cell viability determined 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. interaction DCA 5-FU evaluated median effect principle. Immunocytochemistry bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) carried determine proliferation CRC cells. Cell cycle apoptosis measured flow cytometry, expression apoptosis-related molecules assessed western blot. results demonstrated DCA inhibited viability CRC cells synergistic antiproliferation combination 5-FU. Moreover, compared 5-FU alone, apoptosis CRC cells treated DCA 5-FU enhanced demonstrated changes Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 proteins. results suggest DCA synergistic antitumor effect 5-FU CRC cell lines vitro.
