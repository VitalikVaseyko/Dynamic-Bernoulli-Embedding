 1. Adult, female Xenopus laevis subjected 12 months starvation. 2. Starvation resulted continuous reduction activity hepatic renal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. 3. Fructose-1,6-diphosphatase significantly reduced months 10 12 liver, months 4, 10, 12 kidney. 4. Pyruvate kinase activity muscle liver decreased experimental period whereas renal enzyme remained essentially unchanged. 5. hepatic renal glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) hepatic glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) showed reduction activity 2 4 months starvation followed increase GPT GOT.
