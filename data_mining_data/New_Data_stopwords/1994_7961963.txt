 Purified preparations rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase two polypeptides molecular weights 48,000 (p48) 45,000 (p45). Recently, reported primary structure p48 (Popov, K. M., Kedishvili, N. Y., Zhao, Y., Shimomura, Y., Crabb, D. W., Harris, R. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26602-26606) presented evidence (i) exhibits kinase activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (ii) belongs family mitochondrial protein kinases unique eukaryotic protein kinases. Here, report molecular cloning deduced amino acid sequence p45. protein sequence p45 70% identity protein sequence p48. Minor differences exist throughout protein sequences greatest difference occurring amino termini. Recombinant p45 protein, expressed Escherichia coli purified homogeneity, catalyzed phosphorylation inactivation kinase-depleted pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, indicating p45 p48 correspond different isoforms pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Northern blot analysis revealed single hybridizing species 2.5 kilobases. highest level p45 message expression found heart skeletal muscle lowest spleen lung. Liver, kidney, brain, testis express intermediate amounts p45 mRNA. contrast, p48 mRNA predominantly expressed heart, tissues expressing modest amount message. Tissue-specific expression isoforms pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase may indicate existence tissue-specific mechanisms regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.
