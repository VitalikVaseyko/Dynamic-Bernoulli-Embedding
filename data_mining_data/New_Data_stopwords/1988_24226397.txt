 order determine whether enzymes required convert triose phosphate acetyl CoA present pea (Pisum sativum L.) seed plastids, rapid, mechanical technique used isolate plastids developing cotyledons. plastids intact extraplastidial contamination low. following glycolytic enzymes, though predominantly cytosolic, found present plastids: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), pyruvate kinase(EC 2.7.1.40). Evidence presented indicates plastids also contained low activities enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) phosphoglycerate mutase (EC 2.7.5.3). Pyruvate dehydrogenase, although predominantly mitochondrial, also present plastids. plastidial activities enzymes high enough account rate lipid synthesis observed vivo.
