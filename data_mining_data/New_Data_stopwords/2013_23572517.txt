 Metabolic footprinting supernatants proposed tool assigning gene function. used NMR spectroscopy measure exometabolome 86 single-gene transposon insertion mutant strains (mutants central carbon metabolism regulatory mutants) opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grown medium designed represent nutritional content cystic fibrosis sputum. Functionally related genes similar metabolic profiles. E.g. two-component system mutants, cognate response regulator sensor kinase genes clustered tightly together. strains metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes) could related known gene function. E.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase mutants accumulated large amounts pyruvate medium. cases, metabolic phenotypes easily interpretable. rpoN mutant, lacks alternative sigma factor RpoN (sigma(54)), accumulated high levels gluconate medium. addition, endometabolome profiling intracellular metabolites identified number systemic metabolic changes. linked indirect regulation catabolite repression protein Crc via non-coding RNA crcZ found crcZ (but crc) mutant also shared high-gluconate phenotype. profiled additional set relevant metabolic enzymes transporters, including Crc targets, showed Crc-regulated edd mutant (gluconate-6-phosphate dehydratase) similar gluconate levels rpoN mutant. Finally, set clinical isolates showed patient- random amplification polymorphic DNA (RAPD) type-specific differences gluconate production, associated significantly resistance across four antibiotics (tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, aztreonam, imipenem), indicating potential clinical relevance.
