 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Recent studies shown anti diabetic effects oral sodium tungstate treatment several animal models diabetes based short-term experiments. study, examined effectiveness long-term tungstate treatment streptozotocin-induced-diabetic rats. METHODS: Tungstate administered drinking water rats eight months. RESULTS: treatment resulted reduction serum glucose concentrations diabetic rats, change glycaemia detected healthy rats. Alterations hepatic glucose metabolism due diabetes almost completely counteracted tungstate treatment. partial recovery glucokinase activity, found diabetic animals, normalised glycogen glucose 6-phosphate concentrations. Tungstate treatment also restored pyruvate kinase activity fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentrations. healthy rats, tungstate treatment modify majority hepatic parameters studied. Moreover, tungstate treatment prevented diabetes-induced morphological changes kidney ocular lens also reduced mortality. Furthermore, hypoglycaemic episodes undesirable side effects observed treated diabetic healthy rats. addition, evidence intolerance developing prolonged use. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Tungstate could play helpful part long-term treatment diabetes.
