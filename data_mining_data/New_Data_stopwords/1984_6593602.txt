 26-year-old girl muscle phosphorylase deficiency exercise intolerance experienced occasional "second wind" phenomenon. Muscle glycogen concentration three times normal level, whereas glycolytic intermediate phosphorylase step equivalent 10% normal level. Semi-ischemic forearm exercise tests disclosed elevation venous lactate pyruvate level, showed remarkable increases serum creatine kinase ammonia. Glucagon administration markedly augmented exercise tolerance. Forearm exercise glucagon injection significantly increased venous lactate. Thus, beneficial effect glucagon attributable blood glucose utilization muscle.
