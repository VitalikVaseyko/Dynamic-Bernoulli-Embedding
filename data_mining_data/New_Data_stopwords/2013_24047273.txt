 metabolic adaptations support oncogenic growth also render cancer cells dependent certain nutrients. Along Warburg effect, increased utilization glutamine one metabolic hallmarks transformed state. Glutamine catabolism positively regulated multiple oncogenic signals, including transmitted Rho family GTPases c-Myc. recent identification mechanistically distinct inhibitors glutaminase, selectively block cellular transformation, revived interest possibility targeting glutamine metabolism cancer therapy. Here, outline regulation roles glutamine metabolism within cancer cells discuss possible strategies for, consequences of, impacting processes therapeutically.
