 rate net CO(2) assimilation mature wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves ambient air (21% O(2), 340 microbars CO(2)) declined time illumination temperatures lower 25 degrees C, higher temperatures, rate decline increased maintained air higher CO(2) concentration (700-825 microbars). latter case, decline rate net CO(2) assimilation also occurred high temperatures. Stomatal conductance also declined time cases stomata became sensitive CO(2), primary cause decrease CO(2) assimilation internal partial pressure CO(2) remained constant. Treatments reduced rate translocation (e.g. lower temperatures, chilling base leaf) produced marked decline CO(2) assimilation leaves atmospheric high CO(2) concentrations. decreased net CO(2) assimilation correlated carbohydrate accumulation case, suggesting end product inhibition photosynthesis. Analysis CO(2) assimilation high carbohydrate leaves function intercellular CO(2) partial pressure showed reduction upper part curve. initial slope curve, however, affected. Photosynthetic rates upper part curve generally recovered short period darkness carbohydrates removed leaf. stimulation net CO(2) assimilation 2% O(2) (Warburg effect), apparent quantum yield, decreased several hours light.
