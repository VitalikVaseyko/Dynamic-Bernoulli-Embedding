 Shikimic acid important metabolic intermediate various applications. paper presents novel control strategy construction shikimic acid producing strains, without completely blocking aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Growth phase-dependent expression gene deletion performed regulate aroK gene expression shikimic acid producing Escherichia coli strain, SK4/rpsM. strain, aroL aroK genes deleted, aroB, aroG*, ppsA, tktA genes overexpressed. relative amount shikimic acid accumulated SK4/rpsM 1.28-fold higher SK4/pLac. Furthermore, novel shikimic acid production pathway, combining expression dehydroquinate dehydratase-shikimate dehydrogenase (DHQ-SDH) enzyme woody plants, constructed E. coli strains. results demonstrated growth phase-dependent control aroK gene leads higher SA accumulation (5.33 g/L) SK5/pSK6. novel design achieve higher shikimic acid production using amount medium used current methods also widely used modifying metabolic pathways.
