 Mouse renal cell tumors (RCTs) induced male CBA mice 5 subcutaneous injections 8 mg 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)/kg body weight week. lag period 2 yr kidneys removed, serial cryostat sections kidneys histochemically analyzed following parameters: glycogen content, basophilia, activities glycogen synthase (SYN), glycogen phosphorylase (PHO), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malic enzyme (ME), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT). RCTs displayed histochemical profile irrespective size growth pattern. comparison normal kidney epithelium, neoplastic cells exhibited elevated activities enzymes glycolysis (HK, PK, LDH) pentose phosphate pathway (G6PDH), negative G6Pase low SDH activity observed cells. majority RCTs showed high PHO activity weak staining SYN. Activities ALPase GGT negative RCTs. Markedly enlarged cells atypical nuclei detected advanced RCTs. Higher activities glycolytic mitochondrial enzymes G6PDH found enlarged cells tumor cells. Tubular preneoplastic lesions similar neoplastic lesions morphological histochemical characteristics. present study revealed markedly elevated capacity glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway occurred RCTs mice. similar histochemical pattern preneoplastic tubular lesions observed suggests metabolic aberrations emerge early carcinogenesis, additional studies early stages renal carcinogenesis needed substantiate assumption.
