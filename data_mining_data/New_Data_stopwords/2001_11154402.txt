 Glucose metabolism Prevotella intermedia Prevotella nigrescens investigated. Glucose increased anaerobic growth bacteria promoted accumulation intracellular polysaccharide. polysaccharide confirmed glycogen-like glucan absorption spectrum iodinepolysaccharide complex sugar composition. washed cells consumed glucose anaerobically converted part glucose metabolic end-products acetate, formate succinate. rest glucose confirmed accumulated intracellular polysaccharide. cells grown presence glucose produced acetate, formate succinate without exogenous glucose along consumption intracellular polysaccharide. metabolism glucose intracellular polysaccharide required bicarbonate. Prevotella cells hexokinase set usual enzymes Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway except phosphofructokinase pyrophosphate-dependent. series enzymes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase fumarate reductase, found succinate formation. Another series enzymes, pyruvate oxidoreductase, pyruvate formate-lyase, phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase found acetate formate formation. Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate-dependent phosphoglucomutase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-activated UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase detected glycogen synthesis, glycogen phosphorylase glycogen degradation. capacity intracellular polysaccharide formation addition glucose fermentation could advantageous survival supragingival area well subgingival area.
