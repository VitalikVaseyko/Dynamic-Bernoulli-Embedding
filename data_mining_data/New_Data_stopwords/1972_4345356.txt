 1. activities gluconeogenic glycolytic enzymes concentrations citrate, ammonia, amino acids, glycogen, glucose 6-phosphate, acetyl-CoA, lactate pyruvate measured kidney cortex normal, diabetic, cortisone-treated growth hormone-treated rats. 2. kidney cortex diabetic, cortisone-treated growth hormone-treated rats activities glucose 6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9), fructose 1,6-diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) phosphopyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.32) increased. 3. activities glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3), alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2), aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.10) pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) increased diabetic cortisone-treated rats. growth hormone-treated rats activity aspartate aminotransferase depressed three enzymes unchanged. 4. activity hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) altered conditions. Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) activity depressed growth hormone-treated rats. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activity depressed cortisone-treated growth hormone-treated rats unchanged diabetic rats. 5. Amino acids, acetyl-CoA glucose 6-phosphate contents increased rat kidneys three conditions. Ammonia content increased diabetic cortisone-treated rats markedly diminished growth hormone-treated rats. 6. [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio elevated diabetic cortisone-treated rats unchanged growth hormone-treated rats. Citrate content increased kidney cortex diabetic growth hormone-treated rats unchanged cortisone-treated rats. activity ATP citrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.8) depressed diabetic growth hormone-treated rats increased cortisone-treated rats. 7. Glycogen content moderately elevated growth hormone-treated rats markedly elevated diabetic rats, whereas change glycogen content observed cortisone-treated rats. Glycogen synthetase (EC 2.4.1.11) activity unchanged three conditions. Phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1) activity affected cortisone-treated rats depressed diabetic growth hormone-treated rats.
