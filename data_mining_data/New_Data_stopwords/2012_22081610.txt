 hypothesized aquaporin-9 (AQP9) part unknown route hepatocyte glycerol uptake. previous study, leptin receptor-deficient wild-type mice became diabetic suffered fasting hyperglycemia whereas isogenic AQP9(-/-) knock-out mice remained normoglycemic. reason improvement AQP9(-/-) mice established before. Here, show increased glucose output (by 123% +/- 36% S.E.) primary hepatocyte culture 0.5 mM extracellular glycerol added. increase depended AQP9 absent AQP9(-/-) cells. Likewise, increase abolished 25 muM HTS13286 (IC(50) ~ 2 muM), novel AQP9 inhibitor, identified small molecule library screen. Similarly, AQP9 deletion chemical inhibition eliminated glycerol-enhanced glucose output perfused liver preparations. following control experiments suggested inhibitor specificity AQP9: (i) HTS13286 affected solute permeability cell lines expressing AQP9, cell lines expressing AQPs 3, 7, 8. (ii) HTS13286 influence lactate- pyruvate-dependent hepatocyte glucose output. (iii) HTS13286 affect glycerol kinase activity. experiments establish AQP9 primary route hepatocyte glycerol uptake gluconeogenesis thereby explain previously observed, alleviated diabetes leptin receptor-deficient AQP9(-/-) mice.
