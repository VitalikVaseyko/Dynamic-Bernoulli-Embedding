 Cancer cells exhibit altered metabolism including aerobic glycolysis channels several glycolytic intermediates de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. discovered increased expression phosphoribosyl amidotransferase (PPAT) phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, phosphoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase (PAICS) enzymes de novo purine biosynthetic pathway lung adenocarcinomas. Transcript analyses next-generation RNA sequencing gene expression profiling studies suggested PPAT PAICS serve prognostic biomarkers aggressive lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis PAICS performed tissue microarrays showed increased expression disease progression significantly associated poor prognosis. gene knockdown over-expression studies demonstrate altering PPAT PAICS expression modulates pyruvate kinase activity, cell proliferation invasion. Furthermore identified genomic amplification aneuploidy divergently transcribed PPAT-PAICS genomic region subset lung cancers. also present evidence regulation PPAT PAICS pyruvate kinase activity L-glutamine, co-substrate PPAT. glutamine antagonist, 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) blocked glutamine mediated induction PPAT PAICS well reduced pyruvate kinase activity. summary, study reveals regulatory mechanisms purine biosynthetic pathway enzymes PPAT PAICS, pyruvate kinase activity increased exposes existing metabolic vulnerability lung cancer cells explored pharmacological intervention.
