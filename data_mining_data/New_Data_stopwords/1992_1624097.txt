 determine whether specific hormonal responses involved production cryoprotectant (glucose) liver freeze tolerant wood frog, Rana sylvatica, metabolically active hepatocytes isolated reasonable yields (mean 20.1 +/- 1.30% SEM, n = 29) situ liver perfusion collagenase. Freshly isolated cells autumn-collected frogs contained large amounts glycogen (650 mumol glucosyl units/g packed cells) produced glucose endogenous reserve rate 10 mumol g-1 hr-1 0 degrees. Glucose output cells highly responsive addition hormones; rates glucose release increased 2.1-, 1.7-, 1.7-fold addition 10(-7) bovine glucagon, 10(-7) epinephrine, 5 x 10(-6) dibutyryl-cyclic AMP, respectively. Norepinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, bovine insulin without effect 0.1 microM/l. Hormone stimulation glucose release correlated increase total activity percentage glycogen phosphorylase hepatocytes. However, none hormones tested affected kinetic properties hepatocyte pyruvate kinase, suggesting absence covalent modification control enzyme. data indicate freezing-stimulated production large quantities glucose cryoprotectant R. sylvatica liver involve qualitative differences hormonal control liver glycogenolysis, compared lower vertebrates. However, quantitative differences seen, much greater phosphorylase activity, 4.38 +/- 0.33 mumol min-1 g-1 packed cells, freshly isolated R. sylvatica hepatocytes compared 0.36 +/- 0.06 mumol min-1 g-1 Rana pipiens hepatocytes.
