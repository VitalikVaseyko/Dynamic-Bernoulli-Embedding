 AIM: investigate similarities dissimilarities patients hepatitis B hepatitis C, clinically metabolically. METHODS: Fifty patients hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus infection included study, along fifty healthy controls comparison purposes. Intravenous blood (10 mL) samples patients healthy subjects collected made clot serum separated immediately levels enzymes, alkaline phosphatase (ALK), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (s-GOT) serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (s-GPT) determined kit method. total content metal serum samples analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Levels cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, creatinine uric acid determined using kit method Microlab 300. RESULTS: Serum magnesium copper levels remained unchanged, whereas concentration zinc decreased iron increased significantly groups patients. Total antioxidant activity significantly decreased hepatitis B C. Among enzymes analyzed, ALK, s-GPT, LDH s-GOT significantly increased patients hepatitis B C whereas CPK significantly decreased patients hepatitis B remained unchanged patients hepatitis C. CONCLUSION: information accumulated study help provide better understanding involved metabolic processes order design appropriate therapeutic approaches treating patients, recover lead normal lives.
