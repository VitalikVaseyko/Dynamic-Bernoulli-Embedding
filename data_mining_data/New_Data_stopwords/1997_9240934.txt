 Diets high simple carbohydrates low fats lead mammalian liver induction set enzymes involved lipogenesis. induction occurs, part, transcriptional mechanisms lead elevated levels mRNA enzymes. lipogenic enzymes, increase glucose metabolism required trigger transcriptional response. intracellular mediator signaling pathway unknown, although evidence suggests either glucose-6-phosphate xylulose-5-phosphate. Studies map regulatory sequences lipogenic enzyme genes involved transcriptional response performed L-type pyruvate kinase, S14, acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase genes. studies identified DNA sequences necessary link signal generated carbohydrate metabolism specific nuclear transcription factors.
