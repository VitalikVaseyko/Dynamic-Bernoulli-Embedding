 Iron absorption inadequately increased patients chronic haemolytic anaemia, commonly complicated iron overload. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) identified bone marrow-derived factor abrogates hepcidin-mediated protection iron overload conditions increased erythropoiesis. Increased concentrations GDF15 reported beta-thalassaemia patients GDF15 found suppress hepcidin expression vitro. study interdependencies iron metabolism erythropoiesis vivo, concentrations hepcidin GDF15 determined sera 22 patients pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) 21 healthy control subjects. PKD patients, serum hepcidin levels 13-fold lower controls (2.0 ng/ml vs. 26.2 ng/ml) GDF15 significantly higher (859 pg/ml vs. 528 pg/ml). Serum hepcidin concentrations correlated positively haemoglobin negatively serum GDF15. results suggest GDF15 contributes low hepcidin expression iron loading PKD.
