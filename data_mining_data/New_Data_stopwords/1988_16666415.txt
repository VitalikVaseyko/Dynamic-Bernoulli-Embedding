 requirements reactivation (dephosphorylation) pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaf mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) studied terms magnesium ATP effects intact permeabilized mitochondria. requirement high concentrations magnesium reactivation previously reported partially purified PDC shown affect inactivation rather reactivation. observed rate inactivation catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase always greater reactivation rate catalyzed PDH-P phosphatase. Thus, reactivation would occur ATP becomes limiting. However, pyruvate potent inhibitor inactivation presence thiamine pyrophosphate, results increased PDC activity. Analysis dynamics phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle indicated covalent modification steady state control. steady state activity PDC increased addition pyruvate. PDH kinase activity increased threefold storage mitochondria suggesting may unknown level regulation exerted enzyme complex.
