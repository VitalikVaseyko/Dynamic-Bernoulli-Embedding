 1. Two duplicate groups rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri; mean weight 27 g) given diets differing selenium content (deficient 0.025 mg Se/kg; supplemented 1.022 mg Se/kg) 30 weeks. 2. significant differences treatments weight gain packed cell volume, liver vitamin E liver plasma Se concentrations significantly lower Se-deficient trout. 3. Ataxia occurred 10% Se-deficient trout histopathologies evident nerve cord (damage axon sheath) liver (loss integrity endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria appearance increased vesiculation). 4. Glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) activity significantly reduced liver plasma Se-deficient fish indication, differential assay, non-Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity. Glutathione transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) activity significantly increased Se-deficient trout.
