 Hydrogen/deuterium exchange combination mass spectrometry (H/D MS) sensitive technique detection changes protein conformation dynamics. However, wide application H/D MS hindered, part, lack computational tools necessary efficient analysis large data sets associated technique. report novel web-based application automatic analysis H/D MS experimental data. application relies high resolution mass spectrometers extract isotopic envelopes correlating envelopes individual peptides. Although fully automatic analysis possible, variety graphical tools included aid verification correlations rankings isotopic peptide envelopes. demonstration, rate constants H/D exchange peptides rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase mapped onto structure protein.
