 C(4)-dicarboxylic acids appear metabolized via tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle N(2)-fixing bacteria (bacteroids) within legume nodules. Sinorhizobium meliloti bacteroids alfalfa, NAD(+)-malic enzyme (DME) required N(2) fixation, activity thought required anaplerotic synthesis pyruvate. contrast, pea symbiont Rhizobium leguminosarum, pyruvate synthesis occurs via either DME pathway catalyzed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) pyruvate kinase (PYK). report dme mutants broad-host-range Sinorhizobium sp. strain NGR234 formed nodules whose level N(2) fixation varied 27 83% (plant dry weight) wild-type level, depending host plant inoculated. NGR234 bacteroids significant PCK activity, single pckA single dme mutants fixed N(2) reduced rates, pckA dme double mutant N(2)-fixing activity (Fix(-)). Thus, NGR234 bacteroids appear synthesize pyruvate TCA cycle intermediates via DME PCK pathways. NGR234 data, together reports, suggested completely Fix(-) phenotype S. meliloti dme mutants may specific alfalfa-S. meliloti symbiosis. therefore examined ME-like genes azc3656 azc0119 Azorhizobium caulinodans, azc3656 mutants previously shown form Fix(-) nodules tropical legume Sesbania rostrata. found purified AZC3656 protein NAD(P)(+)-malic enzyme whose activity inhibited acetyl-coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) stimulated succinate fumarate. Thus, whereas DME required symbiotic N(2) fixation A. caulinodans S. meliloti, rhizobia activity bypassed via another pathway(s).
