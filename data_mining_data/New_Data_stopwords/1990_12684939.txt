 macrocytic hypochromic anemia, marked reliculocytosis large numbers circulating nucleated erythrocytes, recognized 3 1/2-year-old male Beagle-cross dog. presumptive diagnosis erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency made, even though PK activity patient within range activities measured normal dogs, PK activity several times normal light large number reticulocytes present. PK activity hemolysate patient heat-labile compared activities hemolysates normal dogs, finding consistent results previous study PK-deficient Basenji dogs. Seven phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates 2,3-diphosphoglycerate measured protein-free extracts erythrocytes patient. present concentrations present normal canine erythrocytes, supporting diagnosis PK deficiency.
