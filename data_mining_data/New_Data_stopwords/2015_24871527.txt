 BACKGROUND: experiment conducted evaluate effects constant heat stress growth performance protein metabolism skeletal muscle Arbor Acres broilers. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy 21-day-old Arbor Acres broilers similar body weight (1298 +/- 28 g) selected 3-week trial (29-49 days age). broilers randomly assigned three groups including control group, constant heat stress group pair-fed group. Up-regulation rectal temperature mRNA expression heat shock protein 70 liver indicate model constant heat stress success. average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, breast thigh muscle weight, percentage breast muscle, crude protein content breast thigh muscle constant heat stress group significantly lower control group pair-fed group. Serum uric acid content glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity significantly higher, protein content glutamic-pyruvate transaminase activity significantly lower liver heat stress group control pair-fed groups. expression insulin-like growth factor 1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p70S6 kinase associated protein synthesis lower breast muscle higher thigh muscle heat stress group compared control fed-pair groups. thigh muscles, expression muscle ring-finger protein-1 MAFbx associated protein degradation higher heat stress group control pair-fed groups. CONCLUSION: Poor performance birds heat stress may due lower synthesis increased degradation proteins.
