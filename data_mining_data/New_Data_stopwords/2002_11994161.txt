 Pyruvate kinase final regulatory point catabolic Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway, controls carbon flux glycolytic intermediates regulates level ATP cell. previous study, identified, cloned sequenced pyruvate kinase obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis demonstrated enzyme active crude extract. Here, report kinetic properties highly purified C. trachomatis pyruvate kinase. results indicate C. trachomatis pyruvate kinase 53.5 kDa pH optima 7.3. Kinetic studies show C. trachomatis pyruvate kinase requires K+ Mg2+ ions activity, exhibits sigmoidal kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate Michaelis-Menten kinetics respect ADP. addition, C. trachomatis pyruvate kinase able use alternative nucleoside diphosphates phosphate acceptors, although shows greatest activity ADP. contrast bacterial pyruvate kinases activated AMP, data show AMP, addition ATP GTP, inhibits C. trachomatis pyruvate kinase. Surprisingly, unlike known bacterial pyruvate kinase, C. trachomatis pyruvate kinase allosterically activated fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, important regulatory metabolite reported eukaryotes.
