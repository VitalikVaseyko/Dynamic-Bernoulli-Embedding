 dynamic response glycolysis investigated using two-enzyme model three different type input flux time dependences: constant, sinusoidal, amplitude frequency modulated (AM FM) input flux. analysis reveals system acts device transduces amplitudes frequencies input function complex remarkably diverse response patterns. device may one response possibilities single input function, owing coexistence attractors phase space. case one response function switched short substrate pulses. Stroboscopic plots reveal chaotic regimes obtained sinusoidal input flux obey stretch-fold-press process, similar baker's transformation, upon change stroboscoping phase. Chaotic oscillations obtained FM conditions often show much higher degree randomness obtained sinusoidal input. expressed quantitatively enhanced Liapunov dimension attractors.
