 Blood patients suffering non-spherocytic chronic haemolytic anemia due individual mutations glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) pyruvate kinase (PK) investigated biochemical rheological methods. enzymopathies characterized strong increase (by factor 2 4) overall RBC-rigidity elastic membrane shear modulus RBC. positive correlation changed elastic shear modulus clinical picture case PK deficiency and, contrast, negative correlation patients G-6-PD enzymopathies. ability RBC change shape static deformability determined excess surface regarding enclosed volume, rheological properties hemoglobin content membrane extension bending moduli. dynamic deformability characterized time constant rapid elastic plastic deformations becomes important entrance discharge processes microcirculation. rheological relevant properties subjected metabolic control. Although enzymopathies mechanism hemolysis understood detail, assumed PK deficient RBC mostly phagocytized hand G-6-PD deficient cells destroyed higher extent intravasal hemolysis. aim study investigate whether expected changes RBC membrane structure due decreased ATP production PK enzymopathies diminished NADPH production G-6-PD deficiencies result abnormal mechanical membrane properties. answer give better understanding premature RBC destruction.
