 Two cDNA clones encoding distinct forms plastid pyruvate kinase (designated Pka Pkg) recently characterized. Pkg found leucoplasts chloroplasts, whereas Pka present leucoplasts. precursors proteins different vitro import characteristics. Pkg precursor behaves like typical stromal protein precusor types plastid. contrast, Pka precursors accumulate outer envelope membrane leucoplasts assay conditions require higher level ATP import organelle. Interestingly, binding Pka precursors chloroplasts cannot detected tested level ATP even though precursors imported organelle higher concentrations ATP. Various N-terminal deletions chimeric fusions used examine translocation signaling mechanism Pka precursor. N-terminal 83-amino-acid segment Pka contains transit peptide capable directing dihydrofolate reductase mature body Pkg types plastid. Unlike complete Pka precursor, fusion proteins behave like typical stromal protein precursors. behavior Pka transit peptide influenced 19-amino-acid domain (-P-S-S-I-E-V-D-A-V-T-E-T-E-L-K-E-N-G-F-) located immediately downstream N-terminal 83-residue segment. Deletion domain Pka alters import properties resembles typical stromal protein precursor. Re-introduction 19-residue domain Dhfr fusion protein alters import characteristics resemble complete Pka precursor. 19-amino-acid domain also influence function transit sequences precursors placed immediately behind transit peptide. results suggest 19-amino-acid domain plays important role governing import characteristics Pka precursor. named 19-residue segment "import modifying domain."
