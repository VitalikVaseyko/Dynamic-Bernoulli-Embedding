 Evidence presented co-immobilized bioluminescent reagents include firefly luciferase, pyruvate kinase adenylate kinase used adenylate assay bacterial cells. changes ATP, ADP AMP content induced irradiation low-power He-Ne-laser depend laser power irradiation dose. data obtained suggest laser irradiation causes activation adenine nucleotide synthesis de novo.
