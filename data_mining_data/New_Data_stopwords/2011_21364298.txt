 dynamic model lactic acid fermentation using Lactococcus lactis constructed, metabolic flux analysis (MFA) metabolic control analysis (MCA) performed reveal intensive metabolic understanding lactic acid bacteria (LAB). parameter estimation conducted COPASI software construct accurate metabolic model. experimental data used parameter estimation obtained LC-MS/ MS analysis time-course simulation study. MFA results reasonable explanation experimental data. parameter estimation, metabolic system lactic acid bacteria thoroughly understood comparisons original parameters. coefficients derived MCA indicated reaction rate L-lactate dehydrogenase activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate pyruvate, pyruvate appeared stronger activator L-lactate dehydrogenase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Additionally, pyruvate acted inhibitor pyruvate kinase phosphotransferase system. Glucose 6-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate showed activation effects pyruvate kinase. Hexose transporter strongest effector flux L-lactate dehydrogenase. concentration control coefficient (CCC) showed similar results flux control coefficient (FCC).
