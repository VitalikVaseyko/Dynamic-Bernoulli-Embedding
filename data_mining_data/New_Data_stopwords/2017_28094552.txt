 Warburg effect states main source energy cancer cells aerobic respiration, glycolysis-even normoxia. shift one governed mutually counteracting enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Anaerobic metabolism cancer cells promotes cell proliferation, local tissue immunosuppression, resistance hypoxic conditions, metastatic processes. switching glucose back oxidative metabolism, effects might reversed. achieved using PDK inhibitors, dichloroacetate. Patients suffering ischemic conditions might benefit effect. hand, beta-blockers (adrenergic beta-antagonists) often used patients appear improve cancer-specific survival, nonselective beta-blockers shown promote glucose oxidation.
