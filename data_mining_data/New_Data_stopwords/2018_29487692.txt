 present application deep neural network (DNN) ensembles trained transcriptomic data identify novel markers associated mammalian embryonic-fetal transition (EFT). Molecular markers process could provide important insights regulatory mechanisms normal development, epimorphic tissue regeneration cancer. Subsequent analysis significant genes behind DNNs classifier independent dataset adult-derived human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived progenitor cell lines led identification COX7A1 gene potential EFT marker. COX7A1, encoding cytochrome C oxidase subunit, up-regulated post-EFT murine human cells including adult stem cells, expressed pre-EFT pluripotent embryonic stem cells vitro-derived progeny. COX7A1 expression level observed undetectable low multiple sarcoma carcinoma cell lines compared normal controls. knockout gene mice led marked glycolytic shift reminiscent Warburg effect occurs cancer cells. DNN approach facilitated elucidation potentially new biomarker cancer pre-EFT cells, embryo-onco phenotype, may potentially used target controlling embryonic-fetal transition.
