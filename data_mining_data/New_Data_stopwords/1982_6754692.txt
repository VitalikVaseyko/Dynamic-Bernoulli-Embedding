 Escherichia coli mutant using NAD-linked dehydrogenase instead ATP-dependent kinase first enzyme glycerol dissimilation excreted dihydroxyacetone initial phase growth. intermediate salvaged growth culture advanced. transient loss intermediate medium appeared partly determined variation level glycerol dehydrogenase growth conditions. 2% casein hydrolysate carbon energy source, cellular level dehydrogenase increased 1 order magnitude end growth. increase probably caused depletion certain metabolites prevented addition pyruvate glucose growth medium. repressive effect compounds lifted addition cyclic AMP. Diminution oxygen tension culture medium increased cell density directly responsible increase enzyme level. Thus, neither catabolite repression respiratory repression implicated important control mechanism synthesis enzyme. Since increases specific activity enzyme cell extracts reflected increases concentration enzyme protein, post-translational control also involved. novel kind regulation gene expression indicated.
