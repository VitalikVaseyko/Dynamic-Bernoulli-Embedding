 heart Python regius functionally divided systemic blood pressure much higher pulmonary pressure (6.6+/-1.0 0.7+/-0.1 kPa, respectively). present study shows force production cardiac strips cavum arteriosum cavum pulmonale exhibits similar force production stimulated vitro. high systemic blood pressure caused, therefore, thicker ventricular wall surrounding cavum arteriosum rather differences intrinsic properties cardiac tissues. Similarly, differences contractile properties right left atria. Force production similar atria ventricle atria contracted relaxed much faster ventricle. Graded hypoxia markedly reduced twitch force four cardiac tissues, pronounced PO(2) 40 kPa. contrast, four cardiac tissues insensitive acidosis normoxia although acidosis increased sensitivity hypoxia. Adrenergic stimulation increased twitch force cardiac tissues, cholinergic stimulation affected atria reduced twitch force markedly. spite different oxygen availability two sides heart, biochemical functional properties alike differences may instead overcome coronary blood supply.
