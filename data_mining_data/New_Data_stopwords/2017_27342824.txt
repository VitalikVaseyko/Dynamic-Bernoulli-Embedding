 BACKGROUND: studies indicated glucose metabolism plays important role pathogenesis rheumatoid arthritis (RA). study aimed find novel genes affecting glucose metabolism RA. MATERIALS/METHODS: Synovial tissues collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) analyzed Rat Glucose Metabolism RT(2) Profiler PCR Array screen genes special expressions glucose metabolism. Real-time PCR, western blotting, ELISA used confirm result synovial tissues blood human RA. Culture synovial fibroblast cells (RASF) treated siRNA suppress expressions target genes. CCK-8 cell proliferation assay two-compartment transwell system performed examine cell proliferation cell migration treated RASF. RESULTS: PCR array real-time PCR detected up-regulation ENO1, HK2, PGK1 down-regulation PCK1 PDK4 synovial tissues CIA rats. Real-time PCR western blotting detected increased expression ENO1 PGK1 RA synovial tissues. ELISA detected high level PGK1 blood RA patients. Decreased cell proliferation cell migration capabilities significantly detected RASF following treatment anti-PGK1 siRNA. IL-1beta IFN-gamma rather TNF-alpha IL-1alpha levels significantly declined supernatants treated RASF. CONCLUSIONS: PGK1, glycolytic enzyme catalyzing conversion 3-phosphoglycerate 2-phosphoglycerate, increased expression synovial tissues blood RA, may involved pro-inflammation synovial hyperplasia disease.
