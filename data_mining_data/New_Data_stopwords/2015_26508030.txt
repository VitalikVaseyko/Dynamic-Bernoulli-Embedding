 High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection may play important role non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) development. However, recent studies proved directly associated lung cancer. aim study evaluate underlying molecular mechanism HPV16 regulate expression GLUT1 may promote development lung cancer. HPV16, HIF-1alpha, GLUT1 detected pleural effusions patients lung cancer (n = 95) benign lung disease (n = 55) immunocytochemistry. Western blotting qRT-PCR used detect expression chances HPV16 E6/E7, HIF-1alpha, GLUT1 lung cancer cells. HPV16, HIF-1alpha, GLUT1 significantly likely expressed malignant group benign group detected immunocytochemistry (ICC), HIF-1alpha significantly correlated HPV16 GLUT1 malignant group (P < 0.01). Expression changes E6 E7 significantly promoted protein expression HIF-1alpha, expression protein mRNA GLUT1, effect expression HIF-1alpha mRNA lung cancer cells. inhibition HIF-1alpha, obviously downregulated expression protein mRNA GLUT1 lung cancer cells. E6 E7 regulated expression GLUT1 may due mediation HIF-1alpha lung cancer cells. results suggest E6 E7 play important role regulation Warburg effect may valuable therapeutic target HPV-related cancer.
