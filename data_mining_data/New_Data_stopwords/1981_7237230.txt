 Reactivity sulfhydryl groups rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase toward 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) studied presence activating divalent metal ions, substrate, substrate analogue, allosteric inhibitor, L-Phe. pattern sulfhydryl modification various complexes pyruvate kinase consistent extent enzyme inactivation DTNB similar conditions. sulfhydryl reactivity Mg(II)-, Co(II)-, Mn(II)-substituted pyruvate kinase toward DTNB depended upon nature activating divalent metal ions used following order increasing potency, Mg(II) less Mn(II) less Co(II), inversely related order catalytic efficiency metal ions alkaline pH. Similar optical spectra patterns sulfhydryl modification DTNB metal derivatives pyruvate kinase observed upon binding substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), substrate analogue, phosphoglycolate, also provided complete protection enzyme inactivation DTNB. L-PHe, eht hand, deprotected enzyme inactivation sulfhydryl modification DTNB presence PEP following order potency depending upon activating metal ions, Mn(II) less Co(II) less Mg(II), parallels order metal dependency L-Phe inhibition enzyme. L-Ala, reverses L-Phe inhibition Mg(II)- Co(II)-activated enzyme, restored protective effect PEP presence L-Phe. different patterns sulfhydryl reactivity toward Mn(II)-enzyme (hyperbolic) Mg(II)-enzyme (sigmoidal) correspond well kinetic patterns presence L-Phe, indicating presence different conformational states two metal-enzyme complexes. results led us conclude enzyme sulfhydryl reactivity toward DTNB used valid index allosteric conformational changes rabbit muscles pyruvate kinase.
