 effect addition different carbohydrates (starch, glucose, fructose) feed investigated using experimental animal. Additionally, admixture cholesterol cholesterol plus cholic acid tested. Fructose (70% feed) causes slight increase serum triglyceride concentration slight increase triglyceride concentration liver. Fructose lesser degree glucose cause increase pyruvate kinase activity liver. activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase increased slightly following high-dosed glucose, whereas increase pronounced following fuctose-rich feed. admixture cholesterol (with cholic acid) causes decrease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity 70%. activity glutamate dehydrogenase decreased also following cholesterol admixture. fructose-rich diet causes slight degree hyperlipemia metabolic situation similar latent diabetic state. effect greatly intensified addition cholesterol cholic acid diet rats. Especially striking increase serum-free-fatty-acid concentrations groups animals. speculated sign insulin deficiency. so-called "carbohydrate-induced hypertriglyceridemia" obviously intensified within short period admixture cholesterol plus cholic acid experimental diet.
