 Pyruvate kinase (PK) key enzyme process glycolysis, catalyzing phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate. Currently, PK isozyme type M2 (PKM2), one subtype PK, proposed new tumor marker high expression various tumor tissues. aimed explore effects siRNA-PKM2 ovarian carcinoma (OC) cell lines SKOV3 OVCAR3, PKM2 notably expressed. PKM2 gene interference lentivirus vectors built miRNA transfection assay. siRNA-PKM2-transfected SKOV3 OVCAR3 cells evaluated cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, cell apoptosis, cell migration, invasion study. addition, expression levels several tumor-related genes measured using real-time PCR Western blot. Results showed siRNA-PKM2 markedly inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, caused cell cycle arrest G0/G1 phase. Cell migration invasion significantly suppressed siRNA-PKM2. Furthermore, tumor-related genes caspase 7, Bad, E-cadherin upregulated, MMP2, HIF1alpha, VEGF, MMP9 depressed siRNA-PKM2. function siRNA-PKM2 biological behavior OC cells indicated PKM2 may also target treatment OC.
