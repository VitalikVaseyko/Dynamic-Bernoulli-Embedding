 present study aimed investigate effect maternal malnutrition offspring glucose tolerance epigenetic mechanisms involved. total, twelve primiparous LandracexYorkshire gilts fed rations providing either 100 % (control (CON)) 75 % (undernutrition (UN)) nutritional requirements according National Research Council recommendations, throughout gestation. Muscle samples offspring collected birth (dpn1), weaning (dpn28) adulthood (dpn189). Compared CON pigs, UN pigs showed lower serum glucose concentrations birth, showed higher serum glucose insulin concentrations well increased area blood glucose curve intravenous glucose tolerance test dpn189 (P<0.05). Compared CON pigs, GLUT-4 gene protein expressions decreased dpn1 dpn189 muscle UN pigs, accompanied increased methylation GLUT4 promoter (P<0.05). alterations methylation concurred increased mRNA levels DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 dpn1 dpn28, DNMT3a dpn189 DNMT3b dpn1 UN pigs compared CON pigs (P<0.05). Interestingly, although average methylation levels muscle GLUT4 promoter decreased dpn189 compared dpn1 pigs exposed poor maternal diet (P<0.05), methylation differences individual CpG sites pronounced age. results indicate utero undernutrition persists silence muscle GLUT4 likely DNA methylation ageing process, may lead amplification age-associated glucose intolerance.
