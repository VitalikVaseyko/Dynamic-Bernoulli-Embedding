 study aimed evaluate effects feeding glycerol-enriched yeast culture (GY) feed intake, lactation performance, blood metabolites, expression key hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes dairy cows transition period. Forty-four multiparous transition Holstein cows blocked parity, previous 305-d mature equivalent milk yield, expected calving date randomly allocated 4 dietary treatments: Control (no additive), 2 L/d GY (75.8 g/L glycerol 15.3 g/L yeast), 150 g/d glycerol (G; 0.998 g/g glycerol), 1 L/d yeast culture (Y; 31.1 g/L yeast). additives top-dressed hand mixed upper one-third total mixed ration morning -14 +28 relative calving. Results indicated DMI, NE intake, change BCS, milk yields affected treatments ( > 0.05). Supplementation GY increased milk fat percentages, milk protein percentages, milk protein yields relative Control G group ( < 0.05). Cows fed GY G higher glucose levels lower beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) NEFA levels plasma cows fed Control ( < 0.05) lower NEFA levels cows fed ( < 0.05). 14 postpartum, cows fed GY G higher enzyme activities, mRNA, protein expression cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C; < 0.05); higher enzyme activities ( < 0.05) tendency toward higher mRNA expression ( < 0.10) glycerol kinase (GK); tendency toward higher enzyme activities pyruvate carboxylase (PC) liver ( < 0.10) compared cows fed Control Y. enzyme activities, mRNA, protein expression PEPCK-C, PC, GK differ cows fed GY G ( > 0.10). conclusion, dietary GY supplementation increased milk fat protein content cows early lactation GY G supplementation improved energy status indicated greater plasma glucose lower plasma BHBA NEFA concentrations upregulated hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes dairy cows transition period. Feeding cows GY mixture peripartum period combined effects yeast lactation performance effects glycerol energy status dairy cows.
