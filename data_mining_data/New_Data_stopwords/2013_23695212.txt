 Melatonin contribute glucose homeostasis either decreasing gluconeogenesis counteracting insulin resistance distinct models obesity. However, precise mechanism melatonin controls glucose homeostasis completely understood. Male Wistar rats administered intracerebroventricular (icv) injection melatonin one following: icv injection phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, icv injection melatonin receptor (MT) antagonist, intraperitoneal (ip) injection muscarinic receptor antagonist. Anesthetized rats subjected pyruvate tolerance test estimate vivo glucose clearance pyruvate load situ liver perfusion assess hepatic gluconeogenesis. hypothalamus removed determine Akt phosphorylation. Melatonin injections central nervous system suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis increased hypothalamic Akt phosphorylation. effects melatonin suppressed either icv injections PI3K inhibitors MT antagonists ip injection muscarinic receptor antagonist. conclude melatonin activates hypothalamus-liver communication may contribute circadian adjustments gluconeogenesis. data suggest physiopathological relationship circadian disruptions metabolism reduced levels melatonin found type 2 diabetes patients.
