 Escherichia coli strains devoid one two pyruvate kinase isoenzymes (PKA PKF), grown minimal media batch fermentations. strain lacking PKs showed 28% decrease specific growth rate compared wild type. However, protein CO2 yields change. Using radioactive 1-C14 glucose collecting CO2 produced cultures, found mutant lacking pyruvate kinases, metabolized glucose mainly pentose pathway (PP). increased participation PP glucose metabolism strain, also reflected levels glucose-6-phosphate 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases.
