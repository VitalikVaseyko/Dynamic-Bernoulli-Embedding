 direct link development insulin resistance presence chronic inflammation, case obesity exists, cytokines playing important role glucose metabolism. Members TGF-beta superfamily, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), shown involved islet morphogenesis, establishment beta-cell mass adipose cell fate determination. Here, demonstrate novel direct role BMP-4 -7 regulation glucose homeostasis insulin resistance. age-dependent increase serum BMP-4 decrease serum BMP-7 levels observed animal models type II diabetes. study, BMP-7 -4 demonstrated antagonistic effects insulin signaling thereby glucose homeostasis. BMP-7 augmented glucose uptake insulin sensitive tissues adipose muscle increasing Glut4 translocation plasma membrane phosphorylation activation PDK1 Akt, phosphorylation translocation FoxO1 cytoplasm liver/HepG2 cells. Restoration BMP-7 levels serum diabetic animals resulted decreased blood glucose levels contrast age matched untreated control groups, opening new therapeutic avenue diabetes. contrary, BMP-4 inhibited insulin signaling activation PKC-theta isoform, resulted insulin resistance attenuation insulin signaling. BMP-7 therefore attractive candidate tackling multifaceted disease diabetes, since reduces body fat, also strengthens insulin signaling, causing improved glucose uptake ameliorating peripheral insulin resistance.
