 active ingredient tumor-promoting croton oil, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), shown increase activity mouse skin epidermal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (+84%), hexokinase (+100%), phosphofructokinase (+158%), pyruvate kinase (+101%). increase activity key enzymes glucose metabolism occurred 2-8 h TPA application due net increase enzyme content. increase activity glycolytic enzymes, well reported TPA-induced increase synthesis RNA DNA cell proliferation, suggest activation glycolytic pathway may involved carcinogenic effects tumor promoters.
