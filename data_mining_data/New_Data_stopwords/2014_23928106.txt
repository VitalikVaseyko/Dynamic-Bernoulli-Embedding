 OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine growth restriction results low birth weight (LBW) linked onset pathological cardiac hypertrophy. altered transition fetal adult energy metabolism phenotype, increased reliance glucose rather fatty acids energy production, could help explain connection. therefore investigated cardiac metabolism relation left ventricular hypertrophy LBW lambs, 21days birth. MATERIALS/METHODS: expression regulatory molecules involved cardiac glucose fatty acid metabolism measured using real-time PCR Western blotting. section left ventricle fixed Periodic Acid Schiff staining determine tissue glycogen content. RESULTS: increased abundance insulin signalling pathway proteins (phospho-insulin receptor, insulin receptor phospho-Akt) glucose transporter (GLUT)-1, change GLUT-4 glycogen content heart LBW compared ABW lambs. was, however, increased abundance cardiac pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK-4) LBW compared ABW lambs. significant changes mRNA expression components peroxisome proliferator activated receptor regulatory complex proteins involved fatty acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: concluded LBW induced left ventricular hypertrophy associated increased GLUT-1 PDK-4, suggesting increased glucose uptake, decreased efficacy conversion glucose ATP. reduced capacity energy conversion could significant implications vulnerability cardiovascular disease adults born LBW.
