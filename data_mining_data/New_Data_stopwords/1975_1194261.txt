 Metal (Me) MeATP interactions adenylate cyclases associated rabbit ventricular particles detergent-dispersed preparation rat cerebellum studied. data simulated fit kinetic models inhibitor (HATP ATP) added constant proportion variable substrate (MeATP). specific models considered enzyme binds (a) MeATP substrate; (b) MeATP substrate HATP ATP inhibitor; (c) MeATP substrate free activator; (d) MeATP substrate, free activator, HATP ATP inhibitor. equilibrium-ordered random (rapid equilibrium assumption) types sequential kinetic models considered. various models tested using cardiac particulate adenylate cyclase presence either phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase creatine phosphate-creatine kinase ATP-regeneration system. Although enzyme either system appeared bind Mg2+ activator, one ATP-regeneration systems also seemed interact directly adenylate cyclase, making clear interpretations difficult. phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase system, kinetic patterns double reciprocal plots linear function MgATP, creatine phosphate-creatine kinase, kinetic patterns concave downward. kinetic models tested using detergent-dispersed cerebellar enzyme, preparation low adenosine triphosphatase activity requiring addition ATP-regeneration system. Reciprocal plots linear intersecting function either MeATP (Me = Mg2+ Mn2+), secondary replots slopes intersecting function either MeATP (Me = Mg2+ Mn2+), secondary replots slopes intercepts also linear. data indicate brain detergent-dispersed enzyme conforms bireactant, sequential mechanism free cation required activator free ATP potent inhibitor.
