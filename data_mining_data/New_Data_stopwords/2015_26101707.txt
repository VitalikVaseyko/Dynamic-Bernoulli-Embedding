 Recent evidence suggests anti-diabetic drug metformin prevents cancer progression, mechanism metformin inhibits tumor growth remains elusive. study, investigated anticancer role metformin gastric cancer explored underlying mechanism. expression hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) different stages gastric cancer tissues detected immunohistochemistry. Gastric cancer cell viability evaluated CCK-8 assay; apoptosis cell cycle analyzed flow cytometry. expression PI3K, Akt, HIF1alpha, PARP, PKM2 COX gastric cancer cells detected immunofluorescence Western blot analysis. found HIF1alpha PKM2 protein expression levels higher advanced gastric cancer tissues gastritis tissues. Metformin reduced gastric cancer cell viability, invasion migration. Metformin induced apoptosis cell cycle arrest part inhibiting PARP expression. Metformin downregulated PI3K, Akt, HIF1alpha, PARP, PKM2 COX expression. Moreover, overexpression HIF1alpha increased gastric cancer cell viability, invasion migration. summary, metformin profound antitumor effect gastric cancer inducing intrinsic apoptosis via inhibition HIF1alpha/PKM2 signaling pathway.
