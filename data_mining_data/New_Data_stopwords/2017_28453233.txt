 Activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) reported disrupt tumour metabolism promote anticancer activity interfering Warburg effect. study investigate whether Warburg effect-related proteins also could identified oral tumour lesions explore functional significance PPARalpha metabolic shift. Five pairs tongue tumour tissues adjacent reference tissues obtained 4-NQO/arecoline induced mouse model analyzed 2-d-gel-electrophoresis LC-MS. Further, hexokinase II level, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, metabolites glycolysis TCA cycle examined order validate effect PPARalpha metabolic shift. Changes protein expression levels revealed seven proteins, involved glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, respiratory chain, down-regulated tumour tissues. found activation PPARalpha fenofibrate could inhibit oral cancer cell growth switch way energy production Warburg effect oxidative phosphorylation. Fenofibrate induced reduction hexokinase II protein levels, increases PDH activity metabolites TCA cycle, impairment ATP production. findings suggested activation PPARalpha reprogram metabolic pathway might impair Warburg effect trigger cancer cell death. study provides novel view changes protein expression profiles involved Warburg effect oral tumourigenesis. Activation PPARalpha impair Warburg effect might offer new strategy oral cancer treatment.
