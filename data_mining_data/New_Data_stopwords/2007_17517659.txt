 Solid tumors frequently contain large regions low oxygen concentrations (hypoxia). hypoxic microenvironment induces adaptive changes tumor cell metabolism, alteration distort local microenvironment. net result tumor-specific changes microenvironment inhibits many standard cytotoxic anticancer therapies predicts poor clinical outcome. Pharmacologic targeting unique metabolism solid tumors could alter tumor microenvironment provide favorable conditions anti-tumor therapy. Here, describe strategy mitochondrial metabolism tumor cells increased pharmacologic inhibition hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) target gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). acute increase oxygen consumption leads corresponding decrease tumor oxygenation. Whereas decreased oxygenation could reduce effectiveness traditional therapies, show dramatically increases effectiveness hypoxia-specific cytotoxin. treatment strategy provide high degree tumor specificity increasing effectiveness hypoxic cytotoxins, depends activation HIF1 presence hypoxia, conditions present tumor, normal tissue.
