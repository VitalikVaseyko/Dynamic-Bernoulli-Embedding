 Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) plays critical roles cancer development progression. Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) contributes greatly tumorigenesis could targeted tumor therapy. However, published data relationship GLUT-1 Warburg effect scarce. study, gastric cancer cell, MKN45, transfected GLUT-1 shRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. Oxygen consumption, LDH activity, lactate production cytoplasmic pyruvate detected MKN45 cells GLUT-1 knockdown. last, hexokinase 1 (HK1), HK2, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression detected using western blot. study, showed inhibition GLUT-1 expression reversed Warburg effect MKN45 cells, induced apoptosis.
