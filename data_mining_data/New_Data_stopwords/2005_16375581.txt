 reported dimeric isoform enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 overexpressed various solid tumor cells. Hence, suggested circulating levels so-called tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (Tu M2-PK) could used tumor marker monitoring systemic therapies various solid tumors. analyzed validity tumor marker comparing plasma levels Tu M2-PK patients different non-malignant diseases levels healthy individuals patients hematological diseases. Plasma levels Tu M2-PK measured using ELISA assay total 284 patients. mean Tu M2-PK concentration 32 U/mL significantly higher group patients hematological malignancies (n = 121) (p < 0.001). However, 37% healthy individuals (n = 63) 44% patients non-malignant diseases (n = 100), especially patients acute inflammatory reaction (67%), found elevated levels Tu M2-PK using cutoff level 15 U/mL. specificity 59% sensitivity 51%. significant correlation prevalence hematological malignancy positive Tu M2-PK result. Thus, data imply Tu M2-PK useful tumor marker hematological malignancies solid tumors, significant number false positive results detected healthy individuals patients non-malignant diseases.
