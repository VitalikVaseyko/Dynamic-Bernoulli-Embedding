 examined metabolic responses hypoxia-tolerant killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) 15 h severe hypoxia recovery emphasis muscle substrate usage regulation mitochondrial protein pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), controls carbohydrate oxidation. Hypoxia survival involved transient activation substrate-level phosphorylation muscle (decreases [creatine phospate] increases [lactate]) time mechanisms reduce overall ATP consumption initiated. metabolic transition affect total cellular [ATP], impact cellular energy status indicated large decreases [ATP]/[ADP(free)] [ATP]/[AMP(free)] significant loss phosphorylation potential Gibbs free energy ATP hydrolysis (DeltafG'). activity PDH rapidly (within 3 h) decreased approximately 50% upon hypoxia exposure remained depressed relative normoxic samples throughout. Inactivation PDH primarily mediated via posttranslational modification following accumulation acetyl-CoA subsequent activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Estimated changes cytoplasmic mitochondrial [NAD(+)]/[NADH] parallel one another, suggesting mitochondrial NADH shuttles function hypoxia exposure. Large increases expression PDK (PDK isoform 2) consistent decreased PDH activity; however, changes mRNA associated changes total PDK-2 protein content assessed using mammalian antibodies. changes expression known hypoxia-responsive genes (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase-A -B) observed either muscle liver.
