 BACKGROUND: insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling axis plays major role tumorigenesis. previous experiment, chronically treated mice several agonists IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). found chronic treatment insulin analogues high affinity towards IGF1R (IGF1 X10) decreased mammary gland tumor latency time p53(R270H/+)WAPCre mouse model. Frequent injections insulin analogues mildly activated IGF1R vivo (glargine insulin) significantly decrease tumor latency time mouse model. METHODS: Here, performed next-generation RNA sequencing (40 million, 100 bp reads) 50 mammary gland tumors unravel underlying mechanisms IGF1R-promoted tumorigenesis. Mutational profiling individual tumors performed screen treatment-specific mutations. transcriptomic data used construct support vector machine (SVM) classifier phenotypic characteristics tumors exposed different insulin analogue treatments could predicted. translational purposes, ran classifiers transcriptomic (micro-array) data insulin analogue-exposed human breast cancer cell lines. Genome-scale metabolic modeling performed iMAT. RESULTS: found chronic X10 IGF1 treatment resulted tumors increased sustained proliferative invasive transcriptomic profile. Furthermore, Warburg-like effect increased glycolysis observed tumors X10/IGF1 groups and, lesser extent, also glargine-induced tumors. metabolic flux analysis revealed enhanced glycolysis programming X10/IGF1 tumors associated increased biomass production programs. Although none treatments induced genetic instability enhanced mutagenesis, mutations Ezh2 Hras enriched X10/IGF1 treatment tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, data suggest decreased mammary gland tumor latency time caused chronic IGF1R activation related modulation tumor progression rather increased tumor initiation.
