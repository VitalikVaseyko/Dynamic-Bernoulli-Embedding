 nine decades since proposal Otto Warburg metabolism cancer cells. Unlike normal cells undergo glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation presence oxygen, proliferating cancer cells exhibit increased uptake glucose increased rate glycolysis predominantly undergo lactic acid fermentation. Whether phenomenon consequence genetic dysregulation cancer cause cancer still remains unknown. However, certainly strong link genetic factors, epigenetic modulation, cancer immunosurveillance Warburg effect, discussed review. Dichloroacetate 3-bromopyruvate among substances studied potential cancer therapies. expanding knowledge cellular metabolism, therapies targeting Warburg effect appear promising. review discusses different aspects emerging therapies.
