 6-Phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) rat placenta purified homogeneity recovery 56% enzyme activity original extract. purified enzyme tetramer Mr value subunit 85,000 +/- 1500 shown gel filtration sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Considering properties native rat placental PFK isoenzyme, clear tissue complex mixture homotetramer heterotetramer. Purified placenta PFK displayed little cooperativity pH 7.0 respect fructose 6-phosphate markedly inhibited high concentrations ATP. affinity enzyme fructose 6-phosphate increased fructose 2,6-biphosphate. purified enzyme highly inhibited citrate, whereas slightly inhibited phosphoenol pyruvate. ADP, AMP fructose 2,6-bisphosphate showed little stimulation towards placental PFK. present study suggests placental PFK relatively active enzymic form also probably characterized high rate glycolysis possibly tissue requires high energy production development maintenance fetus placenta tends semipermeable membrane substances exchanged mother fetus.
