 Chemoresistance anticancer drugs substantially reduces survival epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Here, microarray analysis showed collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1) chemotherapy response-associated gene. Chemoresistant cells expressed higher COL11A1 c/EBPbeta chemosensitive cells. COL11A1 c/EBPbeta downregulation suppressed chemoresistance, whereas COL11A1 overexpression attenuated sensitivity cisplatin paclitaxel.The c/EBPbeta binding site COL11A1 promoter identified major determinant cisplatin- paclitaxel-induced COL11A1 expression. Immunoprecipitation immunofluorescence showed resistant cells, Akt PDK1 highly expressed anticancer drugs enhanced binding activity COL11A1 PDK1 binding attenuated PDK1 ubiquitination degradation. Conversely, chemosensitive cells showed decreased activity COL11A1 binding PDK1 increased PDK1 ubiquitination, reversed COL11A1 overexpression. Analysis 104 EOC patients showed high COL11A1 mRNA levels significantly associated poor chemoresponse clinical outcome.
