 presence glycolytic enzymes GLUT-1-type glucose transporter rod cone outer segments determined enzyme activity assays, glucose uptake measurements, Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy. Enzyme activities six glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, found present purified rod outer segment (ROS) preparations. Immunofluorescence microscopy bovine chicken retina sections labeled monoclonal antibodies glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase confirmed enzymes present rod cone outer segments simply contaminants inner segments cells. Rod outer segments also found contain glucose transport activity detected 3-O-[14C]methylglucose uptake exchange. glucose transporter Km 6.3 mM Vmax 0.15 nmol 3-O-methylglucose/s/mg ROS membrane protein net uptake Km 29 mM Vmax 1.06 nmol 3-O-methylglucose/s/mg ROS membrane protein equilibrium exchange. Km values net uptake equilibrium exchange similar values obtained human red blood cells characteristic GLUT-1-type glucose transporter. transport inhibited cytochalasin B phloretin. Western blot analysis immunofluorescence microscopy using type-specific glucose transporter antibodies indicated rod cone outer segment plasma membranes GLUT-1 glucose transporter Mr 45K found red blood cells brain microsomal membranes. Solid-phase radioimmune competitive inhibition studies indicated rod outer segment plasma membranes contained 15% number glucose transporters found human red blood cell membranes estimated density 400 glucose transporter per micron2 plasma membrane. studies support view outer segments generate energy form ATP GTP anaerobic glycolysis supply least energy requirements phototransduction metabolic processes.
