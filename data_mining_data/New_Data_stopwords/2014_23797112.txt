 Leelamine may applicable treat diabetes known inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4. study, developed validated quantification method using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled tandem mass spectrometry analysis, applied pharmacokinetic investigation mouse plasma. Leelamine transition ions multiple reaction-monitoring modes using positive ionization observed m/z 286.4 m/z 173.2. LC performed using ACE 5 C18 column, mixture acetonitrile water containing 0.1% formic acid used mobile phase flow rate 0.22mL/min. Leelamine internal standard (reserpine) retention times 4.1 3.9min, respectively. Acceptable linearity (r(2)=0.995) observed concentration range 10-3000ng/mL, lower limit quantification 10ng/mL mouse plasma. intra-day inter-day accuracy precision less 15%, sufficient quality-control purposes. method used determine leelamine concentrations mouse plasma showed oral bioavailability leelamine 7.6%.
