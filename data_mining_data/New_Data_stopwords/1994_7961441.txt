 actinomycete Amycolatopsis methanolica found employ normal bacterial set glycolytic pentose phosphate pathway enzymes, except presence PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) 3-phosphoglycerate mutase stimulated 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Screening number actinomycetes revealed PPi-PFK activity members family Pseudonocardiaceae. A. methanolica PPi-PFK 3-phosphoglycerate mutase enzymes purified homogeneity. PPi-PFK appeared insensitive typical effectors ATP-dependent PFK enzymes. Nevertheless, strong N-terminal amino acid sequence homology found ATP-PFK enzymes bacteria. A. methanolica pyruvate kinase purified 250-fold characterized allosteric enzyme, sensitive inhibition P(i) ATP stimulated AMP. using mutants, evidence obtained presence transketolase isoenzymes functioning pentose phosphate pathway ribulose monophosphate cycle growth glucose methanol, respectively.
