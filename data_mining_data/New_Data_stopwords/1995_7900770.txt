 relationship substrate metabolism vascular smooth muscle investigated studying acute energetic effects caused creatine analogue beta-guanidinopropionic acid (beta-GPA) porcine carotid arteries using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Porcine carotid arteries superfused 12 h Krebs-Henseleit buffer 22 degrees C, containing 50 mM beta-GPA, either 11 mM glucose 5 mM pyruvate substrate. beta-GPA enters cells becomes phosphorylated creatine kinase produce beta-GPA-P. Perfusion beta-GPA leads formation NMR observable beta-GPA-P (after 2.5 h). appearance beta-GPA-P time significantly greater glucose used substrate. differentiate oxidative glycolytic metabolism phosphorylation beta-GPA, 1 mM cyanide included perfusion buffer containing 50 mM beta-GPA 11 mM glucose. phosphocreatine (PCr) observed conditions, small significant decrease ATP concentration ([ATP]) compared glucose perfusion without cyanide (0.56 +/- 0.02 0.47 +/- 0.02 mumol/g wet wt), greater concentration pyruvate substrate (0.25 +/- 0.03 mumol/g wet wt). Thus [ATP] cyanide treatment maintained glycolytic metabolism. Despite relatively high [ATP], accumulation beta-GPA-P occurred much slower time course ( > 10 h) without cyanide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
