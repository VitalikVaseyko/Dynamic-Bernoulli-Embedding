 polyglutamine expansion within ataxin-1 protein (ATXN1) underlies spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (SCA1), neurological disorder mainly characterized ataxia cerebellar deficits. SCA1, loss gain ATXN1 biological functions contribute cerebellar pathogenesis. However, critical ATXN1 functions pathways involved remain unclear. investigate early signalling pathways regulated ATXN1, performed unbiased proteomic study Atxn1-KO 5-week-old mice cerebellum. Here, show lack ATXN1 expression induces early alterations proteins involved glycolysis [pyruvate kinase, muscle, isoform 1 protein (PKM-i1), citrate synthase (CS), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GPD2), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), alpha -: enolase (ENO1)], ATP synthesis [CS, Succinate dehydrogenase complex,subunit (SDHA), ATP synthase subunit d, mitochondrial (ATP5H)] oxidative stress [peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A1, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase]. SCA1 mice, several proteins (PKM-i1, ATP5H, PRDX6, proteome subunit A6) down-regulated ATP levels decreased. underlying mechanism involve modulation mitochondrial biogenesis, dysregulation activity metabolic regulators glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3beta), decreased Atxn1-KO increased SCA1 mice, mechanistic target rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) (mTOR), unchanged Atxn1-KO decreased SCA1 mice cerebellum onset ataxic symptoms. Pharmacological inhibition GSK3beta activation mTOR SCA1 cell model ameliorated identified ATXN1-regulated metabolic proteome ATP alterations. Taken together, results point early role ATXN1 regulation bioenergetics homeostasis mouse cerebellum. Moreover, data suggest GSK3beta mTOR pathways modulate ATXN1 function SCA1 pathogenesis could targeted therapeutically prior onset disease symptoms SCA1 pathologies involving dysregulation ATXN1 functions.
