 recent discovery vitamin E (VE) regulates gene activity transcriptional level indicates may exert part biological effects mechanisms may independent well-recognised antioxidant function. objective study identification hepatic vitamin E-sensitive genes examination effects corresponding biological endpoints. Two groups male rats randomly assigned either VE-sufficient diet control diet deficient 290 days. High-density oligonucleotide microarrays comprising 7000 genes used assess transcriptional response liver. Differential gene expression monitored period 9 months, four different time-points, rats individually profiled. experimental strategy identified several VE-sensitive genes, chronically altered dietary VE. supplementation down-regulated scavenger receptor CD36, coagulation factor IX 5-alpha-steroid reductase type 1 mRNA levels hepatic gamma glutamyl-cysteinyl synthetase significantly up-regulated. Measurement corresponding biological endpoints activated partial thromboplastin time, plasma dihydrotestosterone hepatic glutathione substantiated gene chip data indicated dietary plays important role range metabolic processes within liver.
