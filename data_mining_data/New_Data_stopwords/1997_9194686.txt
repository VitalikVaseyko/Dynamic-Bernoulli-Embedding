 Effects aging activities heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase examined using 7, 35 60 wk old rats. Aging affect total activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex decreased activity state (percentage active form) complex rats fed condition (52%, 36% 26% 7, 35 60 wk old rats, respectively). decrease complex activity aging suggested associated age-related decrease blood glucose disposal. Starvation 24 h decreased activity state less 3% age groups. activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase associated complex related alteration activity state complex; kinase activity slightly lower 60 wk old rats younger rats fed condition activation kinase starvation greater younger rats. mechanism decrease activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex discussed basis glucose fatty acid utilization heart muscle cells.
