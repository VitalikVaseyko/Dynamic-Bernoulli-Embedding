 Recent evidence indicates decreased oxidative capacity, lipotoxicity, mitochondrial aberrations contribute development insulin resistance type 2 diabetes. goal study investigate effects peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) activation lipid oxidation, mitochondrial function, insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells. HIT-T15 cells (a beta-cell line) exposed high concentrations palmitate GW501516 (GW; selective agonist PPARdelta), found administration GW increased expression PPARdelta mRNA. GW-induced activation PPARdelta up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2); alleviated mitochondrial swelling; attenuated apoptosis; reduced basal insulin secretion induced increased palmitate HIT cells. results suggest activation PPARdelta plays important role protecting pancreatic beta-cells aberrations caused lipotoxicity metabolic syndrome diabetes.
