 highly pathogenic porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) still serious threat swine industry. However, pathogenic mechanism HP-PRRSV remains unclear. infected host porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) virulent HuN4 strain attenuated HuN4-F112 strain utilized fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) screen intracellular proteins differentially expressed host cells infected two strains. 153 proteins significant different expression (P<0.01) observed, 42 subjected mass spectrometry, 24 proteins identified. PAM cells infected virulent strain showed upregulated expression pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1), proteasome subunit alpha type 6 (PSMA6), downregulated cells infected attenuated strain. upregulation PKM2 provides sufficient energy viral replication, upregulation HSPB1 inhibits host cell apoptosis therefore facilitates mass replication virulent strain, upregulation PSMA6 facilitates evasion immune surveillance virus. Studying molecules mentioned may able help us understand unrevealed details HP-PRRSV infection, help us decrease threat swine industry future.
