 Pyruvate kinase key enzyme glycolytic pathway converts phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) associated cancer. PKM2 reported function independently pyruvate kinase activity, crucial cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, growing evidence indicating dimeric PKM2 released tumor cells circulation cancer patients. However, role secreted PKM2 cancer well understood. Here, found phosphorylation level epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) significantly increased upon exposure cells recombinant PKM2 protein. addition, secreted PKM2 induces EGFR phosphorylation activates EGFR downstream signaling triple-negative breast cancer cells. contrast, knocking PKM2 decreased EGFR phosphorylation. Moreover, expression R399E mutant PKM2, reported preferentially form dimer, enhanced EGFR phosphorylation, cellular transformation, cell proliferation strongly wild-type PKM2. Thus, study revealed novel function extracellular PKM2 promoting cancer cell proliferation EGFR activation.
