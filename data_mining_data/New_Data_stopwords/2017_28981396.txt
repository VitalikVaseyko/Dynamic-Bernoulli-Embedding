 Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) soft tissue sarcoma frequently found children. RMS, two major subtypes, is, embryonal RMS alveolar RMS (ARMS). ARMS exclusively worse prognosis caused formation chimeric PAX3-FOXO1 gene. Regarding cancer, Warburg effect known feature cancer-specific metabolism. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), splicer pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) mRNA, positive regulator cancer-specific energy metabolism. investigated expression effects muscle-specific miR-1 miR-133b RMS cells (RD, KYM-1, Rh30, Rh41) view energy metabolism regulation chimeric gene. result, downregulated miR-1 miR-133b/upregulated PTBP1 found RMS cell lines well RMS clinical cases. Ectopic expression either miR types RMS cells induced autophagic cell death silencing PTBP1. Interestingly, validated miR-133b also knock downed PAX3-FOXO1. Moreover, found PAX3-FOXO1 positively regulated PKM2-dominant expression enhanced expression PTBP1. findings suggest miR-1 miR-133b/PTBP1 axis miR-133b/PAX3-FOXO1/PTBP1 axis contributed maintenance cancer-specific energy metabolism.
