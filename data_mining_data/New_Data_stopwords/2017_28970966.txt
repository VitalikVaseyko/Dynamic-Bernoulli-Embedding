 Rapid proliferation Warburg effect make cancer cells consume plenty glucose, induces low glucose micro-environment within tumor. date, cancer cells keep proliferating condition glucose insufficiency still remains explored. Recent studies revealed close correlation excessive fructose consumption breast cancer genesis progression, convincing evidence showing fructose could directly promote breast cancer development. Herein, found fructose, amino acids, could functionally replace glucose support proliferation breast cancer cells. Fructose endowed breast cancer cells colony formation ability migratory capacity effective glucose. Interestingly, although fructose readily used breast cancer cells, failed restore proliferation non-tumor cells absence glucose. results suggest fructose could relatively selectively employed breast cancer cells. Indeed, observed main transporter fructose, GLUT5, highly expressed breast cancer cells tumor tissues normal counterparts. Furthermore, demonstrated fructose diet promoted metastasis 4T1 cells mouse models. Taken together, data show fructose used breast cancer cells specifically glucose-deficiency, suggest high-fructose diet could accelerate progress breast cancer vivo.
