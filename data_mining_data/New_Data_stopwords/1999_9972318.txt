 use Cyclophosphamide, anti-cancer immunosuppressant drug, accompanied number side effects. Rats injected single dose cyclophosphamide (200 mg kg-1 body weight) showed increase levels serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme 53, 24, 55 135%, respectively. Also ability heart liver mitochondria retain accumulated Ca2+ tetraphenylphosphonium ion sharply affected treated rats. Rats injected dose cyclophosphamide plus cyclosporin (500 micrograms kg-1 body weight) showed reduction levels enzymes 44, 21, 43 57%, respectively compared cyclophosphamide-treated rats. Cyclosporin treatment also restored mitochondrial ability retain accumulated Ca2+ tetraphenyl phosphonium ions nearly level untreated rats. suggest cyclophosphamide induced cardio hepatotoxicity increasing heart liver inner mitochondrial membrane permeability Ca2+. protective effect cyclosporin cyclophosphamide-induced damage also support suggestion.
