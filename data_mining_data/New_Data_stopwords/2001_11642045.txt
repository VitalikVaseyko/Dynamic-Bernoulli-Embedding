 Participation enzyme provides phosphorylation thiamine thiamindiphosphate (TDP) thiaminkinase (thiaminpyrophosphokinase, KF 2.7.6.2) rat brain realization thiamine action syntheses acethylcholine (AC) studied. thiamine structure analogue, differ nature radicals 3-d 5-e positions thiazollium cycle used: 3-[(4-amino-2methylpyrimidinyl-5)methyl]-4-methylthiazolium chloride, 3-decyloxycarbonylmethyl-4-metyl-5-beta-hydrozyethylthiazolium chloride, 3-decyloxycarbonylmethyl-4-methylthiazolium chloride. salts concentrations lower Km render active influence thiaminkinase. analysis data shows presence regulation site enzyme distinguishing active enzyme centre participating interaction hydrophobic fragments thiamine molecule participating. comparative studies thiamine mentioned derivatives influence inclusion labelled carbon [2-(14)C] pyruvate acethylcholine confirm assumption key-role thiamine interaction thiaminkinase (meaning phosphorilation) regarding action acethylcholine syntheses, probably, function nervous cells whole.
