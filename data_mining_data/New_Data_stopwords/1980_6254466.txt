 activities key enzymes glycolysis glucose shunt well capacity lactic acid formation determined high-speed tissue supernatant transplantable Albert hepatoma mouse [originally produced oral application chrysoidin (2,4-diaminoazobenzene) C57 Black mice]. Furthermore, particle-bound hexokinase activity determined. following results obtained: hepatoma activities aldolase, pyruvate kinase lactic dehydrogenase hardly altered compared normal liver. activities hexokinase phosphofructokinase increased 2,5-fold, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 2-fold. capacity lactic acid formation glucose 7 times high hepatoma supernatant. Strong differences emerge liver-to-hepatoma relationship terms intracellular distribution hexokinase (total homogenate 1 : 5, supernatant 1 : 2,5 particle-bound hexokinase activity 1 : 18). summarizing consideration results obtained far Albert hepatoma shows malignoma departss several biochemical parameters "Molecular Correlation Concept" maintained Weber, providing evidence individuality tumors.
