 Warburg effect tumor hypoxia underlie unique cancer metabolic phenotype characterized glucose dependency aerobic fermentation. previously showed two non-toxic metabolic therapies - ketogenic diet concurrent hyperbaric oxygen (KD+HBOT) dietary ketone supplementation - could increase survival time VM-M3 mouse model metastatic cancer. hypothesized combining therapies could provide even greater therapeutic benefit model. Mice receiving combination therapy demonstrated marked reduction tumor growth rate metastatic spread, lived twice long control animals. understand effects metabolic therapies, characterized effects high glucose (control), low glucose (LG), ketone supplementation (betaHB), hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT), combination therapy (LG+betaHB+HBOT) VM-M3 cells. Individually combined, metabolic therapies significantly decreased VM-M3 cell proliferation viability. HBOT, alone combination LG betaHB, increased ROS production VM-M3 cells. study strongly supports investigation metabolic therapy potential non-toxic treatment late-stage metastatic cancers.
