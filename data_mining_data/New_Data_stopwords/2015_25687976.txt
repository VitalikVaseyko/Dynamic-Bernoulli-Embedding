 Solid hematologic cancer colonized bone produces number pathologies. One common complications bone pain. Cancer-associated bone pain (CABP) major cause increased morbidity diminishes quality life affects survival. Current treatments satisfactorily control CABP elicit adverse effects. Thus, new therapeutic interventions needed manage CABP. However, mechanisms responsible CABP poorly understood. observation specific osteoclast inhibitors reduce CABP patients indicates critical role osteoclasts pathophysiology CABP. Osteoclasts create acidic extracellular microenvironment secretion protons via vacuolar proton pumps bone resorption. addition, bone-colonized cancer cells also release protons lactate via plasma membrane pH regulators avoid intracellular acidification resulting increased aerobic glycolysis known Warburg effect. Since acidosis algogenic sensory neurons bone densely innervated sensory neurons express acid-sensing nociceptors, acidic bone microenvironments evoke CABP. Understanding mechanism acidic extracellular microenvironment created cancer-colonized bone expression function acid-sensing nociceptors regulated facilitate development novel approaches management CABP. Here, contribution acidic microenvironment created cancer-colonized bone elicitation CABP potential therapeutic implications blocking development recognition acidic microenvironment described. article part Special Issue entitled: Membrane channels transporters cancers.
