 OBJECTIVE: investigate influence significance gastric bypass surgery hepatic gluconeogenesis type 2 diabetic Goto Kakizaki(GK) rats. METHODS: Forty GK rats randomly divided Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group(group A) sham operation group(group B). Differences glucose tolerance experiment(OGTT) preoperative postoperative 1, 2 4 weeks compared weight recorded. Glycated hemoglobin levels measured preoperatively 4 weeks postoperatively. animals sacrificed 4 weeks surgery liver tissues harvested detect relative expression mRNA protein glucose 6 phosphatase(G-6-P) phosphoenol pyruvate kinase(PEPCK) RT-PCR Western blot. RESULTS: Fasting blood glucose levels 6.5, 4.9, 4.7 mmol/L group A, 10.3, 10.4, 12.5 mmol/L group B, differences two groups statistically significant(P<0.05). blood glucose level 2 h stomach lavage 8.3, 6.4 5.5 mmol/L group A, 21.4, 23.8 24.7 mmol/L group B postoperative 1, 2, 4 weeks, differences two groups statistically significant(P<0.05). glycosylated hemoglobin postoperative 4 weeks was(6.8+/-1.0)%, significantly lower group B[(7.9+/-0.8)%, P<0.05]. Hepatic G-6-P PEPCK mRNA relative expression postoperative 4 weeks reduced 21.0% 25.9% respectively compared group B, protein expression reduced well. Immunohistochemistry showed hepatic glycogen sedimentary group increased significantly. CONCLUSION: relative mRNA protein level key enzymes hepatic gluconeogenesis significantly decreased Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery hepatic gluconeogenesis reduced, may potential mechanism decrease blood glucose.
