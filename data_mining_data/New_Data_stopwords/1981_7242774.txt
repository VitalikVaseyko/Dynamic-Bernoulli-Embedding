 patterns brain enzymes linked energy metabolism determined rats aged 3 21 months compared developing brain estimate senescent energy capacity organ. aging, pyruvate kinase increases, pointing towards enhancement glucose-dependence organ. However, NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase declines, suggesting reduction Krebs cycle activity aged rat brain. increase cytoplasmic NAD-malate dehydrogenase found aging could provide alternative mechanism NAD recovery.
