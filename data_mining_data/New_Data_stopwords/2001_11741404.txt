 Trying decrease production Amyloid beta (Abeta) envisaged promising approach prevent neurodegeneration Alzheimer's disease (AD). chronic inflammatory reaction activated microglia cells astrocytes constant feature AD. participation immune system disease process documented several retrospective clinical studies showing inverse relationship prevalence AD nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Previously, demonstrated combination proinflammatory cytokines TNFalpha IFNgamma induces production Abeta-42 Abeta-40 human neuronal cells. present study, neuronal cell line Sk-n-sh incubated 12 h cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen subsequently stimulated cytokines TNFalpha IFNgamma. Ibuprofen treatment decreased secretion total Abeta conditioned media cytokine stimulated cells 50% prevented accumulation Abeta-42 Abeta-40 detergent soluble cell extracts. Viability neuronal cells measured detection apoptosis neither influenced ibuprofen cytokine treatment. reduction production Abeta ibuprofen presumably due decreased production betaAPP, contrast control proteins M2 pyruvate kinase, beta-tubulin cytokine inducible ICAM-1 detected low concentration ibuprofen treated cells. data demonstrate possible mechanism ibuprofen may decrease risk delay onset AD.
