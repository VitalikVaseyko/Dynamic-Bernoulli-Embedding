 present study, demonstrate SBF-1, synthetic steroidal glycoside, strong antitumor activity melanoma cells vitro vivo. SBF-1 induced cell cycle arrest reduced expression various cell cycle related proteins B16BL6 melanoma cells without causing apoptosis. SBF-1 dramatically inhibited kinase activity 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) thus down-regulated phosphorylation protein kinase B (AKT). Among three known isoforms AKT, PDK1 interacted AKT3 B16BL6 melanoma cells, SBF-1 almost completely blocked interaction. addition, adhesion fibronectin expression integrin alpha4 significantly reduced concentration-dependent manner. Knockdown AKT3 resulted decrease integrin alpha4 expression cell adhesion. Moreover, SBF-1 inhibited growth melanoma xenografts down-regulated phosphorylation AKT vivo. mouse model spontaneous metastasis, SBF-1 low doses 1 3 mug/kg enormously inhibited melanoma metastasis draining popliteal lymph nodes. Taken together, study shows small molecular compound SBF-1 strong anti-melanoma activity vitro vivo. mechanism underlying antitumor effect related blockage interaction PDK1 AKT3.
