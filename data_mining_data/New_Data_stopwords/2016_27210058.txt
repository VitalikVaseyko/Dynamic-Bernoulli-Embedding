 Cancer cells show enhanced glucose consumption lactate production even presence abundant oxygen, phenomenon known Warburg effect, related tumor proliferation, progression drug-resistance cancers. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) several members Phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway positively contribute Warburg effect, whereas AMP activated protein Kinase (AMPK) acts negative regulator. Targeting regulator molecules Warburg effect might useful strategy effectively kill cancer cells. Metformin reported effective various cancers inhibits cell proliferation activating AMPK, inhibiting mTOR HIF-1alpha. Several studies suggested efficacy metformin 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) esophageal colon cancer. study, evaluated efficacy metformin 5-FU combined therapy human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) vitro vivo. MTT assay TUNEL assay revealed metformin (4 mg/ml) 5-FU (2.5 microg/ml) combination treatment effectively inhibited cell growth induced apoptosis OSCC cell lines (HSC2, HSC3 HSC4) compared either agent alone. Lactate colorimetric assay detected decreased level lactate supernatants metformin 5-FU treated cells compared cells treated metformin 5-FU. Western blot analysis showed marked downregulation HIF-1alpha mTOR expression, upregulation AMPKalpha cells treated metformin 5-FU combination treatment. Combination therapy metformin (200 mg/kg, i.p.) 5-FU (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 4 weeks (5 days/week) effectively reduced HSC2 tumor growth (77.6%) compared metformin (59.9%) 5-FU (52%) alone nude mice. findings suggest metformin 5-FU combined therapy could exert strong antitumor effect OSCC inhibition Warburg phenomenon tumor cells.
