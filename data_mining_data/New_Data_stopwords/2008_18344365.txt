 Streptococcus pneumoniae shown possess lactate oxidase addition well-documented pyruvate oxidase. activities H(2)O(2)-forming oxidases wild-type cultures detectable even early exponential phase growth attained highest levels early stationary phase. oxidases, defective mutant constructed compared parent regarding dynamics pyruvate lactate aerobic cultures. results obtained indicated energy-yielding metabolism wild type could best described following scheme. (i) long glucose available, approximately one-fourth pyruvate formed converted acetate sequential action pyruvate oxidase acetate kinase acquisition additional ATP; (ii) rest pyruvate reduced lactate dehydrogenase form lactate, partial achievement redox balance; (iii) lactate oxidized lactate oxidase back pyruvate, converted acetate described above; (iv) sequential reactions mentioned continue occur long lactate present. predicted model, exogenously added lactate shown increase final growth yield presence oxidases.
