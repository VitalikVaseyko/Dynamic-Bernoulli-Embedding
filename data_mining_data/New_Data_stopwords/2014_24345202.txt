 measured plasma levels oxidative DNA damage marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) leucocyte mRNA expression levels genes encoding 8-OHdG repair enzyme human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1), anti-oxidant enzymes copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), GPx-4, glutathione reductase (GR) glutathione synthetase (GS), mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins mtDNA-encoded ND 1 polypeptide (ND1), ND6, ATPase 6, mitochondrial transcription factor (Tfam), nuclear respiratory factor 1(NRF-1), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component alpha subunit (PDHA1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 1 (PDK-1) hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) glycolytic enzymes hexokinase-II (HK-II), glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), phosphofructokinase (PFK), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHa). analysed relevance oxidative damage 85 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, four complicated SLE patients undergoing rituximab treatment 45 healthy individuals. SLE patients higher plasma 8-OHdG levels (P < 0.01) lower leucocyte expression genes encoding hOGG1(P < 0.01), anti-oxidant enzymes (P < 0.05), mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins (P < 0.05) glycolytic enzymes (P < 0.05) healthy individuals. increase plasma 8-OHdG correlated positively elevation leucocyte expression genes encoding hOGG1 (P < 0.05), anti-oxidant enzymes (P < 0.05), several mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins (P < 0.05) glycolytic enzymes (P < 0.05) lupus patients. patients, whose leucocyte mtDNA harboured D310 heteroplasmy, exhibited positive correlation mtDNA copy number expression ND1, ND6 ATPase 6 (P < 0.05) negative correlation mtDNA copy number systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) (P < 0.05), well plasma 8-OHdG (P < 0.05). particular, four complicated SLE patients increased expression genes encoding anti-oxidant enzymes, GAPDH, Tfam PDHA1, experienced better therapeutic outcomes rituximab therapy. conclusion, higher oxidative damage suboptimal increases DNA repair, anti-oxidant capacity, mitochondrial biogenesis glucose metabolism may implicated SLE deterioration, impairment might improved targeted biological therapy.
