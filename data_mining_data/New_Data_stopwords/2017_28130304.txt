 dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans, phosphotransacetylase (Pta) acetate kinase (Ack) convert pyruvate acetate concomitant generation ATP. genes pathway tightly regulated multiple environmental intracellular inputs, basis differential expression genes Pta Ack S. mutans investigated. Here, show inactivation S. mutans ccpA codY reduced activity ackA promoter, whereas ccpA mutant displayed elevated pta promoter activity. interactions CcpA promoter regions genes observed using electrophoretic mobility shift DNase protection assays. CodY bound ackA promoter region presence branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). DNase footprinting revealed upstream region genes contains two catabolite-responsive elements (cre1 cre2) bound CcpA. Notably, cre2 site ackA overlaps CodY-binding site. CcpA- CodY-binding sites promoter region genes defined site-directed mutagenesis. differences reported consensus CodY binding site region protected S. mutans CodY noted. Transcription pta ackA genes ccpA mutant strain markedly different low pH relative transcription neutral pH. Thus, CcpA CodY direct regulators transcription ackA pta S. mutans optimize acetate metabolism response carbohydrate, amino acid availability, environmental pH.IMPORTANCE human dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans remarkably adept coping extended periods carbohydrate limitation fasting periods. phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (Pta-Ack) pathway S. mutans modulates carbohydrate flux fine-tunes ability organisms cope stressors commonly encountered oral cavity. Here, show CcpA controls transcription pta ackA genes via direct interaction promoter regions genes branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), particularly isoleucine, enhance ability CodY bind promoter region ackA gene. working model proposed explain regulation pta ackA genes allosterically controlled regulatory proteins facilitates proper carbon flow energy production, essential functions infection pathogenesis carbohydrate amino acid availability continually fluctuate.
