 aim study investigate selected proteomic markers metabolic phenotype breast carcinomas prognostic markers cancer progression. purpose, series 101 breast carcinomas 13 uninvolved breast samples examined quantitative differences protein expression mitochondrial glycolytic markers. beta-subunit mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase (beta-F1-ATPase) heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase identified immunological techniques. Correlations expression level protein markers ratios derived established clinicopathological information tumors follow-up data patients. metabolic proteome breast cancer specimens revealed pronounced shift towards enhanced glycolytic phenotype concurrent profound alteration mitochondrial beta-F1-ATPase/Hsp60 ratio compared normal samples. Discriminant analysis using markers metabolic signature predictor variables revealed classification sensitivity approximately 97%. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed several proteomic variables significantly correlated overall disease-free survival patients. expression level beta-F1-ATPase per se allowed identification subgroup breast cancer patients significantly worse prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated tumor expression beta-F1-ATPase significant marker independent clinical variables assess prognosis patients. conclude alteration mitochondrial glycolytic proteomes hallmark feature breast cancer providing relevant markers aid prognosis breast cancer patients.
