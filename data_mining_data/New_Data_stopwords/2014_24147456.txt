 Tyroserleutide (YSL) active, low-molecular-weight polypeptide vitro vivo anticancer effects human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 cells. study, studied effects YSL PI3K/AKT BEL-7402 cells explore anti-tumor mechanism. Results showed YSL could up-regulate mRNA protein expression tumor suppressor PTEN increase activities, meanwhile inhibited mRNA protein expression oncogene AKT decreased kinase activities AKT PDK1. resuming balance effect YSL PTEN AKT could prevent transmission tumor cell proliferation signals PI3K/AKT pathway. Inhibition AKT would change status downstream effectors PI3K/AKT pathway: (1) inhibition AKT up-regulated expression cell cycle regulatory factors downstream - P21 P27 repressed cell cycle inhibited proliferation tumor cells. (2) Inhibition AKT decreased phosphorylation level MDM2, increased protein level P53 would accelerate death proceeding tumor cells. (3) Inactivation AKT removed inhibition effect phosphorylation Bad, might decrease protein level apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2 Bcl-XL, damaging mitochondria tumor cells inducing apoptosis.
