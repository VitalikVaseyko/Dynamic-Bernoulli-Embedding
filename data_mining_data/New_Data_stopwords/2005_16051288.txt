 Isolated rat hearts perfused glucose, octanoate glucose + octanoate different concentrations copper-based antineoplastic drugs casiopeina II-gly (CSII) casiopeina III-i-a (CSIII). isolated perfused hearts glucose + octanoate, casiopeinas induced diminution cardiac work O2 consumption half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) 4 (CSII) 4.6 (CSIII) microM, 1 h perfusion. Strong inhibition pyruvate 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases well total creatine kinase casiopeinas suggested ATP generation oxidative phosphorylation transfer towards myofibrils targets drugs. consequence, cellular contents ATP phosphocreatine also lowered casiopeinas. Remarkably, casiopeinas less toxic adriamycin (IC50 = 2.6 microM), well-known potent cardiotoxic antineoplastic drug, wide clinical use. open-chest animal, physiological model isolated heart, femoral administration 1 microM drug revealed CSII innocuous likely due strong binding serum albumin, whereas adriamycin induced potent cardiotoxic effect (diminution heart rate severe depression systolic blood pressure). Thus, seems casiopeinas group new antineoplastic drugs milder secondary toxic effects proven drugs adriamycin.
