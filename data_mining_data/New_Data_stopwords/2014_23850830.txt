 quite important understand basic principle embedded main metabolism interpretation fermentation data. this, may useful understand regulation mechanism based systems biology approach. present study, considered perturbation analysis together computer simulation based models include effects global regulators pathway activation main metabolism Escherichia coli. Main focus acetate overflow metabolism co-fermentation multiple carbon sources. perturbation analysis first made understand nature feed-forward loop formed activation Pyk FDP (F1,6BP), feed-back loop formed inhibition Pfk PEP glycolysis. together effect transcription factor Cra caused FDP level affected glycolysis activity. PTS (phosphotransferase system) acts feed-back system repressing glucose uptake rate increase glucose uptake rate. also shown increased PTS flux (or glucose consumption rate) causes PEP/PYR ratio decreased, EIIA-P, Cya, cAMP-Crp decreased, cAMP-Crp turn repressed TCA cycle acetate formed. verified detailed computer simulation. case multiple carbon sources glucose xylose, shown sequential utilization carbon sources observed wild type, co-consumption multiple carbon sources slow consumption rates observed ptsG mutant computer simulation, verified experiments. Moreover, effect specific gene knockout Deltapyk metabolic characteristics also investigated based computer simulation.
