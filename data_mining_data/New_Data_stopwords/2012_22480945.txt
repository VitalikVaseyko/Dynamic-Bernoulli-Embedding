 Microbial biosynthesis fatty acid like chemicals renewable carbon sources attracted significant attention recent years. Free fatty acids used precursors production fuels chemicals. Wild type E. coli strains produce fatty acids mainly biosynthesis lipids cell membranes accumulate free fatty acids intermediates lipid biosynthesis. However, free fatty acids produced breaking fatty acid elongation overexpression acyl-ACP thioesterase. Since acetyl-CoA might important factor fatty acid synthesis (acetate formation pathways main competitive pathways consuming acetyl-CoA pyruvate, precursor acetyl-CoA), long chain fatty acid CoA-ligase (FadD) plays pivotal role transport activation exogenous fatty acids prior subsequent degradation, examined composition secretion free fatty acids four different strains including wild type MG1655, mutant strain inactivation fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway (fadD mutant (ML103)), mutant strains inactivation two major acetate production pathways (an ack-pta (acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase), poxB (pyruvate oxidase) double mutant (ML112)) fadD, ack-pta, poxB triple mutant (ML115). engineered E. coli cells expressing acyl-ACP thioesterase glucose yield higher 40% theoretical yield. Compared MG1655(pXZ18) ML103(pXZ18), acetate forming pathway deletion strains ML112(pXZ18) ML115(pXZ18) produced similar quantity total free fatty acids, indicated acetyl-CoA availability appear limiting factor fatty acid production strains. However, strains show significant differences composition free fatty acids. Different MG1655(pXZ18) ML103(pXZ18), acetate formation pathway deletion strains ML112(pXZ18) ML115(pXZ18) produced similar level C14, C16:1 C16 free fatty acids, free fatty acid compositions strains change significantly time. addition, strains bearing fadD mutation showed significant differences quantities free fatty acids found broth. Finally, examined two potential screening methods selecting isolating high free fatty acids producing cells.
