 Short time incorporation (32)P carried synchronised algae (young cells) depleted phosphate. separation determination acid-insoluble phosphate fractions cells improved fractionation procedure applied. order exclude competition carbon dioxide experiments done absence CO2.Compared nitrogen, CO2-free air produces increase labelling phosphorylated compounds light. strong white light, high pH, air effects remarkable increase (32)P acid-insoluble phosphate (P u), mainly inorganic polyphosphates (P ul), whereas total phosphate uptake remains almost unchanged. increase labelling acid-insoluble phosphate is, therefore, accompanied substantial decrease labelling acid-soluble compounds (P l). weak white light far-red light, low pH even strong white red light, increase phosphate uptake increased labelling acid-stable organic acid-soluble fraction (P os) observed instead. effect oxygen increases somewhat increasing light intensity light saturation, increases markedly increasing oxygen concentration.An essential contribution oxidative phosphorylation oxygen effect ruled account much higher sensitivity oxygen. Pseudocyclic photophosphorylation also regarded main force higher oxygen affinity. Occurrence photorespiration clearly established far related algae (Chlorella), use phosphorylation unknown. better, although complete explanation given comparing oxygen effect well-known inhibition photosynthesis oxygen (Warburg effect), leads increase glycolate formation simultaneous decrease pool sizes carbon reduction cycle intermediates, even absence CO2. Since photophosphorylation process, well photosynthetic electron flow, seem unaffected high oxygen concentrations whereas formation organic phosphate compounds partially inhibited, excess ATP may available polyphosphate synthesis. explanation would consistent assumption polyphosphate-ADP kinase mediates equilibrium ATP polyphosphates, mainly higher pH. low pH cases excess ATP might available increased phosphate uptake phosphorylation endogenous carbohydrates.
