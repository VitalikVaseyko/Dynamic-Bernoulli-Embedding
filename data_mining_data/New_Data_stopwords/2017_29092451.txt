 report first direct observation glycolytic oscillations HeLa cervical cancer cells, regard primordial oscillations preserved living cells. HeLa cells starved glucose glucose serum exhibited glycolytic oscillations nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), exhibiting asynchronous intercellular behaviors. Also found spatially homogeneous inhomogeneous intracellular NADH oscillations individual cells. results demonstrate starved HeLa cells may induced exhibit glycolytic oscillations either high-uptake glucose enhancement glycolytic pathway (Crabtree effect Warburg effect), both. asynchronous collective behaviors oscillations probably due weak intercellular coupling. Elucidation relationship mechanism glycolytic dynamics cancer cells pathophysiological characteristics remains challenge future.
