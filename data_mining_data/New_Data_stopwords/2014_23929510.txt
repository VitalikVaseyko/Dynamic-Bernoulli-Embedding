 abundant ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) plays pivotal roles plant growth development. work, conducted first time iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis wheat seedling growth different exogenous H2 O2 treatments. growth seedlings roots significantly restrained increased H2 O2 concentration stress. Malondialdehyde, soluble sugar, proline contents well peroxidase activity increased increasing H2 O2 levels. total 3,425 proteins identified iTRAQ, 157 showed differential expression 44 newly identified H2 O2 -responsive proteins. H2 O2 -responsive proteins mainly involved stress/defense/detoxification, signal transduction, carbohydrate metabolism. clear up-regulated expression signal transduction stress/defence/detoxification-related proteins H2 O2 stress, plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein, superoxide dismutase, could contribute H2 O2 tolerance wheat seedlings. Increased gluconeogenesis (phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase) decreased pyruvate kinase proteins potentially related higher H2 O2 tolerance wheat seedlings. metabolic pathway wheat seedling growth H2 O2 stress presented.
