 Recent studies demonstrated overexpression c-myc gene liver transgenic mice leads increase utilization accumulation glucose liver, suggesting c-Myc transcription factor involved control liver carbohydrate metabolism vivo. determine whether increase c-Myc might control glucose homeostasis, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test performed. Transgenic mice showed lower levels blood glucose control animals, indicating overexpression c-Myc led increase blood glucose disposal liver. Thus, increase c-Myc might counteract diabetic hyperglycemia. contrast control mice, transgenic mice treated streptozotocin showed normalization concentrations blood glucose, ketone bodies, triacylglycerols free fatty acids absence insulin. findings resulted normalization liver metabolism animals. low glucokinase activity detected liver diabetic control mice, high levels glucokinase mRNA enzyme activity noted liver streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice, led increase intracellular levels glucose 6-phosphate glycogen. liver mice also showed increase pyruvate kinase activity lactate production. Furthermore, normalization expression genes involved control gluconeogenesis ketogenesis production glucose ketone bodies observed streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice. Thus, results suggested c-Myc counteracted diabetic alterations ability induce hepatic glucose uptake utilization block activation gluconeogenesis ketogenesis.
