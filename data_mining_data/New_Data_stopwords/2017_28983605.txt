 Previous studies indicated high expression lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) exists many human cancers. Recently, several reports showed silencing inhibition LDHA could suppress metastasis human cancer including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, mechanism remains unknown. role LDHA RCC migration invasion investigated using immunohistochemistry, western blotting, Transwell scratch assays, vivo experiment. influence LDHA Warburg effect also investigated LDHA activity lactate production assay. LDHA overexpressed RCC tissues predicted worse survival following renal resection. Correlation analysis demonstrated LDHA negatively correlated Ecadherin positively Ncadherin. Experimentally, vivo vitro experiments found downregulation LDHA suppressed RCC cells migration invasion inhibiting EMT. addition, results indicated LDHA could promote Warburg effect. research presented LDHA inhibitor, oxamate, suppressed tumor metastasis inhibiting LDHA activity EMT. results demonstrated LDHA mediates tumor metastasis promoting EMT RCC, suggesting LDHA could promising therapeutic target RCC therapy.
