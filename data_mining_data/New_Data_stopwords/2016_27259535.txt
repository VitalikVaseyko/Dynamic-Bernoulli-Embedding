 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathways evolutionarily-conserved survival mechanisms responding two fundamental stresses, energy deficiency and/or oxygen deprivation. AMPK HIF pathways regulate function survival network several transcription factors, e.g. FOXO, NF-kappaB, NRF2, p53, well protein kinases factors, mTOR, ULK1, HDAC5, SIRT1. Given AMPK HIF activation enhance healthspan lifespan also cancer growth context-dependent manner; seems cancer cells hijack certain survival factors maintain growth harsh conditions. AMPK activation improves energy metabolism, stimulates autophagy, inhibits inflammation, whereas HIF-1alpha increases angiogenesis helps cells adapt severe conditions. First review AMPK HIF signaling mechanisms control function integrated survival network able improve regulation longevity also support progression tumorigenesis. also describe distinct crossroads regulation longevity cancer, e.g. specific regulation AMPKalpha HIF-alpha isoforms, Warburg effect, mitochondrial dynamics, cellular senescence.
