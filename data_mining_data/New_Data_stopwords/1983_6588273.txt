 Eighteen uremic patients received i.v. infusions mixture amino acids three times per week 3 months effort improve cellular amino acid imbalance related cell bioactivities. subset 42 uremic patients stabilized maintenance hemodialysis characterized reduced cellular levels threonine, isoleucine, methionine, ornithine, increased levels aspartate, glycine, arginine, tyrosine, phenylalanine. Protein synthesis (3H-leucine incorporation), energy level [energy charge = (ATP + 1/2 ADP)-(ATP + ADP + AMP)], activity rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase reduced patients compared 32 control normal subjects. circulating leukocyte (88 +/- 5% granulocytes) used cell model. Previously, multiple regression best-subset analysis showed combination cell levels aspartate, valine, isoleucine, ornithine, lysine, tryptophan could "explain" 40% variance protein synthesis patients. Similarly, combination levels aspartate, glutamic acid, glycine, ornithine, arginine "predictive" level energy charge. hypothesized protein synthesis energy level would improved amino acid infusions normalized intracellular levels amino acids predictive bioactivities. 3 months amino acid infusions, levels predictive intracellular amino acids improved, deviated baseline values. Failure detect significant improvement cell bioactivities attributed inability correct imbalance intracellular amino acid pool.
