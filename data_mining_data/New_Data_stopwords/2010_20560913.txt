 PROBLEM: Emerging evidence suggests metabolism influences immune cell signaling immunoregulation. examine immunoregulatory role glycolysis pregnancy, evaluated properties pyruvate kinase leukocytes non-pregnant women normal pregnancy pre-eclampsia. METHOD STUDY: evaluated pyruvate kinase expression lymphocytes neutrophils non-pregnant, pregnant, pre-eclampsia patients using fluorescence microscopy flow cytometry. Leukocyte pyruvate kinase activity pyruvate concentrations also evaluated. study pyruvate's effect signaling, labeled Jurkat cells Ca(2+) dyes measured cell responses presence agents influencing intracellular pyruvate. RESULTS: expression pyruvate kinase reduced lymphocytes neutrophils normal pregnant women comparison non-pregnant women pre-eclampsia patients. Similarly, activity pyruvate kinase intracellular pyruvate concentration reduced leukocytes normal pregnant women comparison non-pregnant women women pre-eclampsia. Using Jurkat cells model leukocyte signaling, shown perturbations intracellular pyruvate influence Ca(2+) signals. CONCLUSION: Normal pregnancy characterized reduced pyruvate kinase expression within lymphocytes neutrophils. speculate reduced pyruvate kinase expression modifies immune cell responses due reduced pyruvate concentrations.
