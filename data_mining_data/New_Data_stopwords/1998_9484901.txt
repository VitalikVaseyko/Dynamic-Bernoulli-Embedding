 immunological analysis Escherichia coli strain unable synthesize main pyruvate formate-lyase enzyme Pfl revealed existence weak, cross-reacting 85 kDa polypeptide exhibited characteristic oxygen-dependent fragmentation typical glycyl radical enzyme. Polypeptide fragmentation cross-reacting species shown dependent Pfl activase. Cloning sequence analysis gene encoding protein revealed coded new enzyme, termed TdcE, 82% identity Pfl. basis RNA analyses, tdcE gene shown part large operon included tdcABC genes, encoding anaerobic threonine dehydratase, tdcD, coding propionate kinase, tdcF, function unknown, tdcG gene, encodes L-serine dehydratase. Expression tdcABCDEFG operon strongly catabolite repressed. Enzyme studies showed TdcE pyruvate formate-lyase 2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase activity, whereas TdcD protein new propionate/acetate kinase. monitoring culture supernatants various mutants using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), followed anaerobic conversion L-threonine propionate. studies confirmed 2-ketobutyrate, product threonine deamination, converted vivo TdcE propionyl-CoA. studies also revealed Pfl yet unidentified thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme(s) perform reaction. Double null mutants deficient phosphotransacetylase (Pta) acetate kinase (AckA) AckA TdcD unable metabolize threonine propionate, indicating propionyl-CoA propionyl-phosphate intermediates pathway ATP generated conversion propionyl-P propionate AckA TdcD.
