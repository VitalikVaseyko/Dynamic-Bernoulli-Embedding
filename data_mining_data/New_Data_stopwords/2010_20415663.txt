 Tight coupling cytosolic mitochondrial metabolism key GSIS (glucose-stimulated insulin secretion). present study examined regulatory contribution PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) kinase 1, negative regulator PDH, metabolic coupling 832/13 clonal beta-cells. Knockdown PDH kinase 1 siRNA (small interfering RNA) reduced mRNA (>80%) protein level (>40%) 72 h. PDH activity, glucose-stimulated cellular oxygen consumption pyruvate-stimulated mitochondrial oxygen consumption increased 1.7- (P<0.05), 1.6- (P<0.05) 1.6-fold (P<0.05) respectively. Gas chromatography/MS revealed altered metabolite profile upon silencing PDH kinase 1, determined increased levels tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates malate, fumarate alpha-ketoglutarate. metabolic alterations associated exaggerated GSIS (5-fold compared 3.1-fold control cells; P<0.01). Insulin secretion, provoked leucine dimethylsuccinate, feed tricarboxylic acid cycle bypassing PDH, unaffected. oxygen consumption metabolic data strongly suggest knockdown PDH kinase 1 beta-cells permits increased metabolic flux glucose-derived carbons tricarboxylic acid cycle via PDH. Enhanced insulin secretion probably caused increased generation tricarboxylic acid cycle-derived reducing equivalents mitochondrial electron transport generate ATP and/or stimulatory metabolic intermediates. basis findings, suggest PDH kinase 1 important regulator PDH clonal beta-cells PDH kinase 1 PDH important efficient metabolic coupling. Maintaining low PDH kinase 1 expression/activity, keeping PDH dephosphorylated active state, may important beta-cells achieve metabolic flux rates necessary maximal GSIS.
