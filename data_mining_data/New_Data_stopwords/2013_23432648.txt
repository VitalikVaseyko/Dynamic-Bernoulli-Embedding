 Cancer metabolism epigenetics two relatively new areas cancer research. Recent years seen explosion studies implicating either altered tumor metabolism epigenetic mechanisms pathogenesis maintenance brain tumors. new paradigm emerging cancer biology represents convergence themes, metabolic regulation epigenetics. discuss interrelationship context two metabolic enzymes influence pathogenesis gliomas altering epigenetic state. first enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), mutated secondary glioblastomas ~70% grade II/III astrocytomas oligodendrogliomas. Mutant IDH1 results production metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) inhibit DNA histone demethylating enzymes resulting glioma-CpG island phenotype (G-CIMP) increased histone methylation marks. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), enzyme plays critical role glycolytic pathway, second example metabolic enzyme affect histone modifications. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven glioblastoma, PKM2 translocates nucleus phosphorylates histone 3 threonine 11 (H3-T11). causes dissociation HDAC3 CCND1 (Cyclin D1) c-MYC promoters subsequent histone acetylation, leading transcription Cyclin-D1 c-MYC, subsequent cell proliferation. Modification epigenetic state alterations metabolic enzymes novel phenomenon contributes pathogenesis gliomas may help identification new therapeutic targets.
