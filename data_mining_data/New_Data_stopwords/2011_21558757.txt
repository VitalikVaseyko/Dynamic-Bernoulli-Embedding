 examined intracellular pH (pHi) ten cancer cell lines derived different organs two normal cell lines including human embryonic lung fibroblast cells (HEL) human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) vitro, found pHi cancer cells evidently higher (pH 7.5 7.7) normal cells (7.32 7.44 HEL HUVEC, respectively) primary leukemic cells erythrocytes hitherto reported (</=7.2). Higher pHi cancer cells could related Warburg effect cancer cells enhanced glycolytic metabolism. Since reversal Warburg effect may perturb intracellular homeostasis cancer cells, looked compounds cause extensive reduction pHi, major regulator glycolytic pathway associated metabolic pathway. found phenoxazine compounds, 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one (Phx-3) 2-amino-4,4alpha-dihydro-4alpha,7-dimethyl-3H-phenoxazine-3-one (Phx-1) caused rapid drastic dose-dependent decrease pHi ten different cancer cells within 30 min, though extent decrease pHi significantly larger Phx-3 (DeltapHi = 0.6 pH units 100 microM Phx-3) Phx-1 (DeltapHi = 0.1 pH units 100 microM Phx-1). rapid drastic decrease pHi variety cancer cells caused Phx-3 Phx-1 possibly perturbed intracellular homeostasis, extensively affected subsequent cell death, phenoxazines exerted dose-dependent proapoptotic cytotoxic effects cells 72 h incubation, confirming causal relationship DeltapHi cytotoxic effects due Phx-3 Phx-1. Phx-3 Phx-1 also reduced pHi normal cells including HEL HUVEC, although exerted less proapoptotic cytotoxic effects cells cancer cells. Drugs Phx-3 Phx-1 reduce pHi thereby induce cellular apoptosis might serve benevolent anticancer drugs.
