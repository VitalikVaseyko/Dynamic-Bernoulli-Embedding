 BACKGROUND: Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas important marine fishery resource, contains high levels glycogen contributes flavor quality oyster. However, little known molecular chemical mechanisms underlying glycogen content differences Pacific oysters. Using homogeneous cultured Pacific oyster family, explored regulatory networks level metabolome transcriptome. RESULTS: Oysters highest lowest natural glycogen content selected differential transcriptome metabolome analysis. identified 1888 differentially-expressed genes, seventy-five differentially-abundant metabolites, part twenty-seven signaling pathways enriched using integrated analysis interaction differentially-expressed genes differentially-abundant metabolites. Based results, found high expression carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), indicative increased fatty acid degradation, associated lower glycogen content. Together, high level expression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), high levels glucogenic amino acids likely underlie increased glycogen production high-glycogen oysters. addition, higher levels glycolytic enzymes hexokinase (HK) pyruvate kinase (PK), well TCA cycle enzymes malate dehydrogenase (MDH) pyruvate carboxylase (PYC), imply concomitant up-regulation energy metabolism high-glycogen oysters. High-glycogen oysters also appeared increased ability cope stress, since levels antioxidant glutathione peroxidase enzyme 5 (GPX5) gene also increased. CONCLUSION: results suggest amino acids free fatty acids closely related glycogen content oysters. addition, oysters high glycogen content greater energy production capacity greater ability cope stress. findings provide insights molecular mechanisms underlying oyster quality, also promote research molecular breeding oysters.
