 Hitherto unknown protective effect N,alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl vincosamide (VR), isolated Moringa oleifera leaves isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac toxicity evaluated rats. Oral administration VR 40 mg/kg 7 days markedly reduced ISO-induced increase levels serum cardiac markers troponin-T, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase glutamate pyruvate transaminase well cardiac lipid peroxidation parallel increase cellular antioxidants suggesting cardio-protective free radical scavenging potential, latter confirmed vitro study. Rats treated test compound also improved ISO-induced abnormal changes ECG well cardiac histology. reduction myocardial necrosis evidenced tri-phenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain isolated test drug pretreated rats. findings suggest cardio-protective potential isolated alkaloid possibly beneficial action mediated free radical scavenging property.
