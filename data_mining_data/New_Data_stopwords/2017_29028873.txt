 current literature role microRNA (miRNA) tumour metabolism growing, number studies regularly confirm impact miRNA energy reprograming tumours. However, remains lack understanding larger perspective role miRNA metabolism story. first part review, provide comprehensive up-to-date description extensive role miRNAs tumour metabolism including glucose, lipid amino acid metabolism. However, second part, aim provide description multidimensional role miRNA playing tumour metabolism. paramount importance role miRNA responding metabolic cues alter cellular state fate, including cancer stem cells, response cues. addition, exosomal miRNAs provide means cells communicate metabolic signals messages cells within tumour microenvironment, altering therefore phenotype functional capacity cells. expanding area research better understanding role miRNA tumour metabolism mechanistic approach, describing miRNAs effect genes, help exploit therapeutic implications behind extensive role miRNA tumour metabolism.
