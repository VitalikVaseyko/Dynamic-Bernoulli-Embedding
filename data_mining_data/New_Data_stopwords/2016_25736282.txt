 Basilar vascular smooth muscle cells (BASMCs) hyperplasia prominent feature cerebrovascular remodeling stroke development hypertension. Tanshinone IIA (Tan) reported exhibit protective effect pathological features hypertension. Previous studies shown phosphoinostitide-3 kinase (PI3K)/3'-phosphoinostitide dependent kinase (PDK1)/AKT pathway involved regulation proliferation various cell types. Therefore, may crosstalk Tan antihypertension processes PI3K/PDK1/AKT proliferative effect BASMCs. test hypothesis, used 2-kidney, 2-clip hypertension model examine effect Tan PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathway cellular, molecular, biochemical approaches. results revealed abundance PDK1 plasma paralleled increase blood pressure cross-sectional area basilar artery hypertensive rats. Tan decreased blood pressure hypertension-induced PDK1 phosphorylation produced effect phosphorylation PI3K. Moreover, Tan attenuated endothelin 1 induced activation PDK1/AKT pathway rat BASMCs. Tan could inhibit cell cycle transition regulating expression cyclin D1 p27, turn, prevent proliferation BASMCs. study provides novel mechanism Tan prevents cerebrovascular cell proliferation hypertension, thus Tan may potential therapeutic agent cerebrovascular remodeling stroke.
