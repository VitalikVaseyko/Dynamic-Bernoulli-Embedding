 oxidation carbohydrates mammals regulated pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, covalently regulated four PDH kinases (PDK1-4) two PDH phosphatases (PDP1-2) unique PDH complex. investigate role PDK4 plays regulating PDH activation (PDHa) muscle contraction, mouse extensor digitorum muscle removed wild type (WT) PDK4-knockout (PDK4-KO) mice 24 h fast stimulated 3 min either 10 Hz (low-intensity contraction), 40 Hz (moderate-intensity contraction), allowed rest. Force recorded muscle PDHa activity metabolite concentrations measured. PDHa activity approximately 2.5-fold higher rest PDK4-KO mice WT mice (P = 0.009) approximately 2-fold higher PDK4-KO mice 10 Hz (P < 0.001) 40 Hz (P < 0.001). Force relative muscle weight similar 10 Hz, 5.8 +/- 0.7 mN.g(-1) PDK4-KO mice 3.5 +/- 0.7 mN.g(-1) WT mice 40 Hz (P < 0.001), similar rate fatigue genotypes. results concluded PDK4 plays role reducing PDHa activity low moderate-intensity muscle stimulation, absence PDK4 subsequent changes carbohydrate utilization may alter force production.
