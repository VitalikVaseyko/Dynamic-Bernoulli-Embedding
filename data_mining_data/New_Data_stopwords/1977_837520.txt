 1. relatively inexpensive semi-automated enzymatic procedure described determination total glycerol Auto Analyzer. Free glycerol determined without saponification deproteinized supernatant. 2. dilution triglyceride samples preparation samples preparation samples quantified directly free glycerol standards multiplying 100. 3. pyruvate kiluent solution used triglyceride sample preparation increase precision improving accuracy determining blank optical densities. 4. end-point reaction complete eight minutes, assay linear 6 mg% free glycerol 600 mg% triglycerides. within-run between-run coefficients variation 1.5% glycerol assay, 1.0% 4.3% triglyceride assay. mean recovery added glycerol 100.7% 102.3% glycerol triglyceride assays respectively.
