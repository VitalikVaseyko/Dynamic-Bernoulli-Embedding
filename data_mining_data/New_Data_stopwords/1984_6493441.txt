 effect intermittent normobaric hypoxia biological pyrimidines (uridine cytidine) specific activities enzymes related cerebral energy metabolism studied. Measurement carried following: homogenate toto; purified mitochondrial fraction; crude synaptosomal fraction, different areas rat brain: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum, medulla oblongata. Intermittent normobaric hypoxia (12 hours daily 5 days) caused modifications enzyme activities homogenate toto (decrease hexokinase cerebellum; increase pyruvate kinase medulla oblongata), purified mitochondrial fraction (increase succinate dehydrogenase corpus striatum) crude synaptosomal fraction (decrease cytochrome oxidase activity cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum; decrease malate dehydrogenase hippocampus cerebellum; decrease lactate dehydrogenase cerebellum). Daily treatment cytidine uridine altered enzyme activities either affected unaffected intermittent hypoxia.
