 ensure optimal environments replication spread, viruses evolved alter many host cell pathways. last decade, metabolomic studies shown eukaryotic viruses induce large-scale alterations host cellular metabolism. viruses examined date induce aerobic glycolysis also known Warburg effect. Many viruses tested also induce fatty acid synthesis well glutaminolysis. modifications carbon source utilization infected cells increase available energy virus replication virion production, provide specific cellular substrates virus particles create viral replication niches increasing infected cell survival. virus species also likely requires unique metabolic changes successful spread recent research identified additional virus-specific metabolic changes induced many virus species. better understanding metabolic alterations required replication virus may lead novel therapeutic approaches targeted inhibition specific cellular metabolic pathways.
