 Pyruvate kinase plays critical role cellular metabolism glucose serving major regulator glycolysis. tetrameric enzyme allosterically regulated different effector molecules, mainly phosphosugars. response binding effector molecules substrates, significant structural changes identified various pyruvate kinase structures. Pyruvate kinase Cryptosporidium parvum exceptional among known enzymes protozoan origin exhibits allosteric property presence commonly known effector molecules. crystal structure pyruvate kinase C. parvum solved molecular replacement techniques refined 2.5 resolution. active site glycerol molecule located near gamma-phosphate site ATP, protein structure displays partially closed active site. However, unlike structures active site closed, alpha6' helix C. parvum pyruvate kinase unwinds assumes extended conformation. crystal structure sulfate ion found site occupied phosphate effector molecule many pyruvate kinase structures. new feature C. parvum pyruvate kinase structure presence disulfide bond cross-linking two monomers asymmetric unit. disulfide bond formed cysteine residue 26 short N-helix one monomer cysteine residue 312 long helix (residues 303-320) second monomer interface monomers. cysteine residues unique C. parvum, disulfide bond remained intact reduced environment. However, significance bond, any, remains unknown time.
