 BACKGROUND: Muscle-related complaints high creatine phosphokinase (CPK) blood levels reported 15-50% patients acne treated isotretinoin. Clinical investigations CPK levels isotretinoin therapy few, case reports. aim study investigate incidence, course, clinical significance severe hyperphosphokinasemia isotretinoin therapy acne. METHODS: total 89 patients treated isotretinoin moderate severe acne dermatology department. initial visit monthly follow-up visits, hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes, thrombocyte, renal function tests (urea creatinine), direct indirect bilirubin, liver enzymes [serum glutamate oxaloacetate (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), gamma glutamil transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphotase (ALP)], lipid profile [total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides], urine analysis, CPK requested. asked patients muscle-related complaints, weakness, exercise, compared CPK levels. RESULTS: Elevated CPK levels recorded five patients treatment period. Maximum serum CPK values recorded patient ranged 292 569 IU/l. one patient five myalgia four patients completely asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: conclusion, marked hyperCPKemia without muscle-related complaints isotretinoin-treated patients acne benign phenomenon; therefore, logical reserve measurement CPK levels well renal tests cases severe muscle pain.
