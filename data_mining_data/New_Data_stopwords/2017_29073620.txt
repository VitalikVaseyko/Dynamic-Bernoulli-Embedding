 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Atractylodes macrocephula Koidz important ingredient traditional Chinese herbs. One major bioactive compound, atractylenolide-1 (ATL-1), reported anti-inflammatory anti-tumor activities. However, underlying molecular mechanism associated well elucidated. METHODS: Cell viability cell cycle distribution measured using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) flow cytometry assays, respectively. Western blot analysis performed examine phosphorylation protein expression extracellular signaling-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), signal transducer activator transcription 3 (Stat3), 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) transcription factor SP1. QRT-PCR used examine mRNA levels PDK1 gene. Exogenously expressions Stat3, PDK1 SP1 carried transient transfection assays. PDK1 promoter activity measured Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit. nude mice xenograft model used confirm findings vitro. RESULTS: showed ATL-1 inhibited human lung cancer cell growth induced cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, found ATL-1 stimulated phosphorylation ERK1/2, inhibited phosphorylation protein expressions Stat3 SP1; latter abrogated presence MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059. Moreover, ATL-1 reduced protein, mRNA expression promoter activity PDK1. Intriguingly, exogenously expressed Stat3 SP1 overcame ATL-1-inhibited SP1 Stat3, PDK1 protein expressions, respectively. Moreover, overexpression PDK1 resisted ATL-1-inhibited lung cancer cell growth. consistent results vitro, ATL-1 inhibited tumor growth, protein expressions Stat3, SP1 PDK1, induced phosphorylation ERK1/2 vivo. CONCLUSION: summary, results show ATL-1 inhibits lung cancer cell growth activation ERK1/2, followed suppressing SP1 protein expression. ATL-1 also reduces phosphorylation protein levels Stat3. mutual regulation Stat3 SP1 proteins affected ATL-1. ultimately suppresses PDK1 gene expression. study reveals novel mechanism ATL-1 inhibits growth lung cancer cells. Thus, targeting PDK1 pinpoints potential lung cancer treatment.
