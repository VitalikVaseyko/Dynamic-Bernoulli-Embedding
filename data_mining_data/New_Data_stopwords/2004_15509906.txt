 Organ, tissue cell banking currently important method used prevent death cells replacement transplantation therapy. 1975 1985 author performed experimental transplantations islets isolated collagenase digestion injection liver portal vein, transplantation minced neonatal pancreases renal capsule alloxan spreptozotocin severely chronic diabetic rats mice. Seventy 256 transplanted rats mice cured 1 year, i.e. one-third life span, 3rd 15th inbreeding 2 weeks immunosuppression azathioprine cyclosporin A. author compares results achieved later diabetic patients whole pancreas transplantation, including prevention diabetic renal ocular complications, infertility, health progeny cured rats, slow rejection possibility cure repeated transplantation. welcomes return islet transplantation, possibly also immunologically tolerant pancreatic stem cell transplantation, transplantation subcutaneous fibroblasts, transfected complex insulin gene, produce adequate insulin prevent hyperglycemia, hepatic pyruvate kinase insulin analog, therapy need permanent immunosuppression.
