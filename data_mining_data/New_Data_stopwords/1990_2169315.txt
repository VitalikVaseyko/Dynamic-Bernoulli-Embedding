 combination phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) concanavalin induces expression new set glycolytic isozymes human peripheral lymphocytes. induced isozyme enzyme tested (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase) usually muscle form, often associated rapidly dividing tumor cells. Increases specific isozyme account 2-5-fold increase specific activities enzyme induced Con plus PMA. Increased specific activities appearance new isozyme forms occur relatively late, probably associated G1 phase cell cycle.
