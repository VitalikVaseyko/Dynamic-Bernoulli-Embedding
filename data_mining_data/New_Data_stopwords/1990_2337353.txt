 o-Phthaldialdehyde caused irreversible inhibition rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase following preliminary formation enzyme-reagent complex. pH 7.5, 35 degrees C, dissociation constant complex maximal pseudo-first-order rate constant covalent modification 0.32 +/- 0.08 mM 2.54 +/- 0.23 min-1, respectively. inactivation accompanied uv-spectral changes pointing isoindole formation, limiting stoichiometry 1 isoindole linkage per enzyme subunit. Phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, ATP effectively protected enzyme inactivation, suggesting active site target o-phthaldialdehyde action. native modified enzymes indistinguishable respect mobility major band sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, concluded crosslinkage intrasubunit character, amino acid residues involved must closely positioned polypeptide backbone. Lysine 366, previously shown selectively reactive toward 2',3'-dialdehyde ADP (Bezares et al., 1987, Arch, Biochem. Biophys. 253, 133-137), cysteine 325 357 implicated.
