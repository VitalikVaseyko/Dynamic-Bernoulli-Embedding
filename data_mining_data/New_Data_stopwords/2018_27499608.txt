 PURPOSE: homeostatic regulation cellular ATP achieved coordinated activity ATP utilization, synthesis, buffering. Glucose major substrate ATP synthesis glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whereas intermediary metabolism tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle utilizes non-glucose-derived monocarboxylates, amino acids, alpha ketoacids support mitochondrial ATP GTP synthesis. Cellular ATP buffered specialized equilibrium-driven high-energy phosphate (~P) transferring kinases. goals twofold: 1) characterize gene expression, protein expression, activity key synthesizing regulating enzymes energy metabolism whole mouse retina, retinal compartments, and/or cells 2) provide integrative analysis results related function. METHODS: mRNA expression data energy-related genes extracted whole retinal Affymetrix microarray data. Fixed-frozen retinas adult C57BL/6N mice used immunohistochemistry, laser scanning confocal microscopy, enzymatic histochemistry. immunoreactivity levels well-characterized antibodies, major retinal cells compartments, obtained using established semiquantitative confocal imaging techniques. Quantitative cytochrome oxidase (COX) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity determined histochemically. RESULTS: Affymetrix data revealed varied gene expression patterns ATP synthesizing regulating enzymes found muscle, liver, brain. Confocal studies showed differential cellular compartmental distribution isozymes involved glucose, glutamate, glutamine, lactate, creatine metabolism. pattern intensity antibodies COX LDH activity showed high capacity photoreceptors aerobic glycolysis OXPHOS. Competition assays pyruvate revealed LDH-5 localized photoreceptor inner segments. combined results indicate glycolysis regulated compartmental expression hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase M1, pyruvate kinase M2 photoreceptors, whereas inner retinal neurons exhibit lower capacity glycolysis aerobic glycolysis. Expression nucleoside diphosphate kinase, mitochondria-associated adenylate kinase, several mitochondria-associated creatine kinase isozymes highest outer retina, whereas expression cytosolic adenylate kinase brain creatine kinase higher cones, horizontal cells, amacrine cells indicating diversity ATP-buffering strategies among retinal neurons. Based antibody intensities COX LDH activity, Muller glial cells (MGCs) lowest capacity glycolysis, aerobic glycolysis, OXPHOS. However, showed high expression glutamate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate thiokinase, GABA transaminase, ~P transferring kinases. suggests MGCs utilize TCA cycle anaplerosis cataplerosis generate GTP ~P transferring kinases produce ATP supports MGC energy requirements. CONCLUSIONS: comprehensive integrated results reveal adult mouse retina expresses numerous isoforms ATP synthesizing, regulating, buffering genes; expresses differential cellular compartmental levels glycolytic, OXPHOS, TCA cycle, ~P transferring kinase proteins; exhibits differential layer-by-layer LDH COX activity. New insights cell-specific compartmental ATP GTP production, well utilization buffering strategies relationship known retinal cellular functions, discussed. Developing therapeutic strategies neuroprotection treating retinal deficits degeneration cell-specific manner require knowledge. work provides platform future research directed identifying molecular targets proteins regulate processes.
