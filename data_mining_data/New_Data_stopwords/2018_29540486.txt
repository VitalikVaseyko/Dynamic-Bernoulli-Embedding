 Cardiac energy produced primarily oxidation fatty acids glucose, relative contributions nutrient sensitive changes substrate availability energetic demand. major contributor cardiac metabolic flexibility pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converts glucose-derived pyruvate acetyl-CoA within mitochondria. PDH inhibited phosphorylation dependent competing activities pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4) phosphatases (PDP1-2). single high-fat meal increases cardiac PDK4 content subsequently inhibits PDH activity, reducing pyruvate utilization abundant fatty acids available. current study demonstrate diet-induced increases PDK4 reversible characterize novel pathway regulates PDK4 degradation response cardiac metabolic environment. found PDK4 degradation promoted coenzyme (CoASH), levels declined mice fed high-fat diet normalized following transition control diet. conclude CoASH functions metabolic sensor linking rate PDK4 degradation fatty acid availability heart. However, prolonged high fat feeding followed return low fat diet resulted persistent vitro sensitivity PDH fatty acid-induced inhibition despite reductions PDK4 content. Moreover, increases levels proteins responsible beta-oxidation rates palmitate oxidation isolated cardiac mitochondria following long term consumption high dietary fat persisted transition control diet. propose changes prime PDH inhibition upon reintroduction fatty acids.
