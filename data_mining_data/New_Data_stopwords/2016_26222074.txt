 Angiogenesis traditionally studied focusing growth factors proangiogenic signals, endothelial cell (EC) metabolism received much attention. Nonetheless, glycolysis, one major metabolic pathways converts glucose pyruvate, required phenotypic switch quiescent angiogenic ECs. vessel sprouting, glycolytic activator PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3) promotes vessel branching rendering ECs competitive reach tip vessel sprout, whereas fatty acid oxidation selectively regulates proliferation endothelial stalk cells. studies show metabolic pathways ECs regulate vessel sprouting, importantly anticipated. review discusses recently discovered role glycolysis fatty acid oxidation vessel sprouting. also highlight metabolites influence EC behavior signaling molecules modulating posttranslational modification.
