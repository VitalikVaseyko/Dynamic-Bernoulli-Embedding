 BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab, humanized antibody targeting HER2, exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy HER2-positive gastric cancer. However, recurrent therapeutic resistance presents revolutionary claims. Warburg effect AKT signaling pathway involved resistance trastuzumab. previous studies demonstrated overexpression metastasis associated colon cancer 1 (MACC1) predicted poor prognosis GC promoted tumor cells proliferation invasion. study, found MACC1 significantly upregulated trastuzumab-resistant cell lines. Besides, downregulation MACC1 reversed resistance. METHODS: effect trastuzumab glycolysis inhibitor combination cell viability, apoptosis, cell metabolism investigated vitro using established trastuzumab-resistant GC cell lines. assessed impact trastuzumab combined oxamate tumor growth metabolism established xenograft model HER2-positive GC cell lines. RESULTS: Here, found MACC1 significantly upregulated trastuzumab-resistant cell lines. Besides, downregulation MACC1 trastuzumab-resistant cells reversed resistance. Overexpression MACC1-induced trastuzumab resistance, enhanced Warburg effect, activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, downregulation MACC1 presented opposite effects. Moreover, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway inhibited, effects MACC1 resistance glycolysis diminished. findings indicated MACC1 promoted Warburg effect mainly PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, enhanced GC cells trastuzumab resistance. CONCLUSIONS: results indicate co-targeting HER2 Warburg effect reversed trastuzumab resistance vitro vivo, suggesting combination might overcome trastuzumab resistance MACC1-overexpressed, HER2-positive GC patients.
