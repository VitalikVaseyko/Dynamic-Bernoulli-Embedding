 Exposure maize leaves 3-hour photoinhibitory treatment (photon flux rate 2,000 microeinsteins meter(-2) second(-1), CO(2)-free air) resulted lower activities light-activated enzymes NADP malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate, Pi dikinase, ribulose-5-phosphate kinase. activities could recovered partially either incubating enzyme extracts dithiothreitol illuminating treated leaf air. Several enzymes light-activated affected treatment. Ribulose-5-phosphate kinase activity also reduced bean plants grown low light subjected similar photoinhibitory treatment.It suggested that, although reactivation enzymes may correlated short term increase CO(2) uptake capacity observed photoinhibited leaves returned illumination air, inactivation enzymes contribute significantly long term vivo expression photoinhibition observed 2 4 hours.The results provide example partial inactivation light-activated enzymes illumination equivalent full sunlight.
