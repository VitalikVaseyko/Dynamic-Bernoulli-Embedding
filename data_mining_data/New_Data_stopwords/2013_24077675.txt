 Cancers diverse origins exhibit marked glucose avidity high rates aerobic glycolysis. Increased understanding dysfunctional metabolism known Warburg effect led interest targeting cancer therapy. One promising strategy targeting glycoconjugation, linking drug glucose another sugar. review summarizes salient examples glycoconjugates, known cytotoxins targeted anticancer therapeutics linked glucose (or another glucose transporter substrate sugar) improved cancer targeting selectivity. Building examples, review also provides series guidelines design mechanistic evaluation future glycoconjugates.
