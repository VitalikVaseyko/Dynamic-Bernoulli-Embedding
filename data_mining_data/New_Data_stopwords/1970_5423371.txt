 pathways carbohydrate metabolism Spirochaeta stenostrepta, free-living, strictly anaerobic spirochete, studied. organism fermented glucose ethyl alcohol, acetate, lactate, CO(2), H(2). Assays enzymatic activities cell extracts, determinations radioactivity distribution products formed (14)C-labeled glucose indicated S. stenostrepta degraded glucose via Embden-Meyerhof pathway. spirochete utilized clostridial-type clastic reaction metabolize pyruvate acetyl-coenzyme A, CO(2), H(2), without production formate. Acetyl-coenzyme converted ethyl alcohol nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent acetaldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase activities. Phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase catalyzed formation acetate acetyl-coenzyme A. Hydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase activities detected cell extracts. rubredoxin isolated cell extracts S. stenostrepta. Preparations rubredoxin stimulated acetyl phosphate formation pyruvate diethylaminoethyl cellulose-treated extracts S. stenostrepta, indication rubredoxin may participate pyruvate cleavage spirochete. Nutritional studies showed S. stenostrepta fermented variety carbohydrates, ferment amino acids organic acids. unidentified growth factor present yeast extract required organism. Exogenous supplements biotin, riboflavin, vitamin B(12) either stimulatory required growth.
