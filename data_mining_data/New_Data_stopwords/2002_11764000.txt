 Peroxisome proliferators, function peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) agonists, group structurally diverse nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens including fibrate class hypolipidemic drugs induce peroxisome proliferation liver parenchymal cells. Sustained activation PPARalpha agents leads development liver tumors rats mice. understand molecular mechanisms responsible pleiotropic effects agents, utilized cDNA microarray generate molecular portrait gene expression liver mice treated 2 weeks Wy-14,643, potent peroxisome proliferator. PPARalpha activation resulted stimulation expression (fourfold greater) 36 genes decreased expression (fourfold decrease) 671 genes. Enhanced expression several genes involved lipid glucose metabolism many genes associated peroxisome biogenesis, cell surface function, transcription, cell cycle, apoptosis observed. include: CYP2B9, CYP2B10, monoglyceride lipase, pyruvate dehydrogenase-kinase-4, cell death-inducing DNA-fragmentation factor-alpha, peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11beta, well several cell recognition surface proteins including annexin A2, CD24, CD39, lymphocyte antigen 6, retinoic acid early transcript-gamma, among others. Northern blotting total RNA extracted livers PPARalpha-/- mice mice lacking PPARalpha peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), fed control Wy-14,643-containing diets 2 weeks, well time course induction following single dose Wy-14,643, revealed upregulation genes identified microarray procedure dependent upon peroxisome proliferation vis-a-vis PPARalpha. However, cell death-inducing DNA-fragmentation factor-alpha mRNA, increased livers wild-type mice treated peroxisome proliferators, enhanced AOX-/- mice spontaneous peroxisome proliferation. observations indicate activation PPARalpha leads increased decreased expression many genes associated peroxisomes, delayed onset enhanced expression genes may result metabolic events occurring secondary PPARalpha activation alterations lipid metabolism.
