 BACKGROUND: first time, microdialysis used investigate vivo online myocardial metabolism cardiac surgery patients treated two different methods myocardial protection. METHODS: Thirty patients underwent standard CABG one two different methods myocardial protection. patients randomised receive either cold blood (COLD group) warm modified Calafiore cardioplegia (WARM group). Microdialysis probes implanted myocardium left ventricular apical region heart. Cardioplegia given antegrade only. Microdialysis measurements performed time intervals before, 24 h cardiopulmonary bypass analysed glucose, lactate, pyruvate glycerol. RESULTS: Myocardial lactate concentrations significantly higher WARM group compared COLD group, serum lactate comparable. Glycerol significantly higher end clamping time WARM group. time glucose-lactate ratio marker nutritional disorder significantly lower levels WARM group. cumulative CK-MB release 24 h significantly higher hearts protected warm blood. CONCLUSIONS: oxidative stress measured significantly higher patients undergoing CABG using modified Calafiore cardioplegia, whereas cold cardioplegia minimised effects aortic clamping. results indicate cold cardioplegia offers superior protection heart, terms rapid normalisation myocardial metabolism. elective myocardial revascularisation, intermittent antegrade warm blood cardioplegia comparable safe method myocardial protection. However, patients referring long clamping time, advantages cold cardioplegia myocardial revascularisation may magnified.
