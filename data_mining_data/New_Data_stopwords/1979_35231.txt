 method developed enzymatic preparation alpha-(32)P-labeled ribo- deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, cyclic [(32)P]AMP, cyclic [(32)P]GMP high specific radioactivity high yield (32)Pi. method also enables preparation [gamma-(32)P]ATP, [gamma-(32)P]GTP, [gamma-(32)P]ITP, [gamma-(32)P]-dATP high specific activity high yield. preparation various [alpha-(32)P]nucleoside triphosphates relies phosphorylation respective 3'-nucleoside monophosphates [gamma-(32)P]ATP polynucleotide kinase subsequent nuclease reaction form [5'-(32)P]nucleoside monophosphates. [5'-(32)P]nucleoside monophosphates converted enzymatically respective triphosphates. reactions leading formation [alpha-(32)P]nucleoside triphosphates carried reaction vessel, without intermediate purification steps, use sequential reactions respective enzymes. Cyclic [(32)P]AMP cyclic [(32)P]GMP also prepared enzymatically [alpha-(32)P]ATP [alpha-(32)P]GTP partially purified preparations adenylate guanylate cyclases. exception cyclases, enzymes used commerically available. specific activity (32)P-labeled ATP made method ranged 200 1000 Ci/mmol [alpha-(32)P]ATP 5800 6500 Ci/mmol [gamma-(32)P]ATP. Minor modifications method permit higher specific activities, especially [alpha-(32)P]nucleoside triphosphates. Methods use [alpha-(32)P]nucleoside phosphates described study adenylate guanylate cyclases, cyclic AMP- cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, cyclic nucleotide binding proteins, precursors synthesis (32)P-labeled compounds biological interest. Moreover, [alpha-(32)P]nucleoside triphosphates prepared method useful studies nucleic acid structure metabolism [gamma-(32)P]nucleoside triphosphates useful study phosphate transfer systems.
