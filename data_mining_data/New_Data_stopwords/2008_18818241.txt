 Sepsis causes muscle atrophy insulin resistance, underlying mechanisms unclear. Therefore, present study examined effects lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxaemia expression Akt, Forkhead Box (FOXO) downstream targets, identify associations changes FOXO-dependent processes influencing muscle atrophy insulin resistance sepsis. Chronically instrumented male Sprague-Dawley rats received continuous intravenous infusion LPS (15 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) saline 24 h 0.4 ml h(-1). Animals terminally anaesthetized extensor digitorum longus muscles hindlimbs removed snap-frozen. Measurements made mRNA protein expression selected signalling molecules associated pathways regulating protein synthesis degradation carbohydrate metabolism. LPS infusion induced increases muscle tumour necrosis factor-alpha (8.9-fold, P < 0.001) interleukin-6 (8.4-fold, P < 0.01), paralleled reduced insulin receptor substrate-1 mRNA expression (-0.7-fold, P < 0.01), decreased Akt1 protein cytosolic FOXO1 FOXO3 phosphorylation. changes accompanied significant increases muscle atrophy F-box mRNA (5.5-fold, P < 0.001) protein (2-fold, P < 0.05) expression, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA (15-fold, P < 0.001) protein (1.6-fold, P < 0.05) expression. 29% reduction muscle protein: DNA ratio, 56% reduction pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity (P < 0.05), increased glycogen degradation lactate accumulation. findings study suggest potential role Akt/FOXO simultaneous impairment carbohydrate oxidation, level PDC, up-regulation muscle protein degradation, LPS-induced endotoxaemia.
