 mutant pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) human erythrocytes easily separated monomers dimers gel chromatography described. Tht mutant enzyme shows almost pH optimum thermostability normal enzyme, decreased stability shaking air, decreased Km phosphoenolpyruvate loss allosteric properties. apparent Km values phosphoenolpyruvate tetramers monomers same. tetrameric enzyme slightly activated fructose-1,6-diphosphate monomeric form not. tetrameric enzyme found dissociate spontaneously dimeric monomeric forms.
