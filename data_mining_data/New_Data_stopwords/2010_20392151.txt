 echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin) relatively new class antifungal drugs function inhibiting synthesis beta-1,3-glucan cell wall thus lead lysis cell. work effect caspofungin release peptides non-growing cells yeast Candida albicans exposed drug monitored. Exposure 0.19 mug/ml caspofungin resulted release amino acids cells small large molecular weight proteins demonstrated 1- 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry employed identify number escaped peptides found increased intensity upon exposure drug. number wall-associated proteins (e.g., phosphoglycerate kinase) number glycolytic enzymes (phosphoglycerate mutase 1, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase) identified. Importantly, several released proteins (e.g., pyruvate kinase, enolase 1, phosphoglycerate mutase, glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase alcohol dehydrogenase 1) highly immunogenic nature. results presented demonstrate non-growing C. albicans cells susceptible effect caspofungin caspofungin-mediated release proteins cells could lead stronger immune response vivo. report illustrates that, addition hampering cell wall synthesis, caspofungin may also interfere permeability fungal cell wall.
