 Otto Warburg's classic treatise reprogramming tumour metabolism oxidative glycolytic metabolism published London 1930. Although Warburg effect one universal characteristics solid tumours, molecular basis phenomenon recently elucidated studies indicating increased expression genes encoding glucose transporters glycolytic enzymes tumour cells mediated transcription factors c-MYC HIF-1. Whereas c-myc direct target oncogenic mutations, expression hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) indirectly up-regulated via gain-of-function mutations oncogenes loss-of-function mutations tumour suppressor genes result increased HIF-1alpha protein expression and/or increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity cell-type-specific manner. result genetic alterations intratumoral hypoxia, HIF-1alpha overexpressed majority common human cancers relative surrounding normal tissue. human breast cancer brain tumours, HIF-1alpha overexpression strongly correlated tumour grade vascularity.
