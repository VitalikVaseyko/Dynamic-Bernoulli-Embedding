 Many cancer cells metabolize glucose preferentially via pyruvate lactate instead CO(2) H(2)O (oxidative phosphorylation) even presence oxygen (Warburg effect). Dichloroacetate (DCA) drug able shift pyruvate metabolism lactate acetyl-CoA (tricarboxylic acid cycle) indirect activation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). subsequently lead increased flow oxygen respiratory chain, associated enhanced generation reactive oxygen species (ROS) may cause apoptosis. order investigate DCA may suitable neuroblastoma therapy, investigated three human neuroblastoma cell lines whether DCA reduce lactate production enhance oxygen consumption. data show, DCA (in low millimolar range) able reduce lactate production, slight shift increased oxygen consumption almost effect cell vitality, proliferation apoptosis three cell lines investigated. Therefore, DCA low millimolar concentrations seems minor efficacy neuroblastoma treatment.
