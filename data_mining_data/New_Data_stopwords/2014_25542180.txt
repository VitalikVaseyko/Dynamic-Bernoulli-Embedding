 field energy metabolism dramatically progressed last decade, owing large number cancer studies, well fundamental investigations related transcriptional networks cellular interactions microenvironment. concept metabolic flexibility clarified studies showing ability cancer cells remodel biochemical pathways energy transduction linked anabolism response glucose, glutamine oxygen deprivation. clearer understanding large-scale bioenergetic impact C-MYC, MYCN, KRAS P53 obtained, along modification course tumor development. metabolic dialog different types cancer cells, also stroma, also complexified understanding bioenergetics raised concepts metabolic symbiosis reverse Warburg effect. Signaling studies revealed role respiratory chain-derived reactive oxygen species metabolic remodeling metastasis development. discovery oxidative tumors human mice models related chemoresistance also changed prevalent view dysfunctional mitochondria cancer cells. Likewise, influence energy metabolism-derived oncometabolites emerged new means tumor genetic regulation. knowledge obtained multi-site regulation energy metabolism tumors translated cancer preclinical studies, supported genetic proof concept studies targeting LDHA, HK2, PGAM1, ACLY. Here, review different facets metabolic remodeling cancer, diversity physiology pathology, search genetic determinants, microenvironmental regulators pharmacological modulators.
