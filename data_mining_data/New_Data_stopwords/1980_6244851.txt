 Partially purified ribonuclease H rat liver nuclei inactivated soluble fraction rat intestine; inactivation restored adding trypsin inhibitor, suggesting factor protease. preparation isolated purified homogeneity. molecular weight enzyme estimated 28 000 optimum pH 8.0 isoelectric point pH 4.5--4.7. inactivating proteolytic activities observed parallel throughout purification procedures. Diisopropylphosphorofluoridate inhibited protease activity. protease inactivates deoxyribonuclease I, pyruvate kinase, aldolase. experiments protease modifiers, seems serine protease trypsin-like nature.
