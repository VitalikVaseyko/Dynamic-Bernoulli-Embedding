 High consumption fructose-sweetened beverages linked high prevalence chronic metabolic diseases. previously shown short course fructose supplementation liquid solution induces glucose intolerance female rats. present work, characterized fructose-driven changes liver molecular pathways involved. end, female rats supplemented liquid fructose (10%, w/v) 7 14 days. Glucose pyruvate tolerance tests performed, expression genes related insulin signaling, gluconeogenesis nutrient sensing pathways evaluated. Fructose-supplemented rats showed increased plasma glucose excursions glucose pyruvate tolerance tests reduced hepatic expression several genes related insulin signaling, including insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2). However, expression key gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, reduced. effects caused inactivation hepatic forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) due increase acetylation state driven reduced expression activity sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). contributing FoxO1 inactivation, fructose consumption elevated liver expression spliced form X-box-binding-protein-1 consequence increase activity mammalian target rapamycin 1 protein 38-mitogen activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK). Liquid fructose affects insulin signaling (IRS-2 FoxO1) nutrient sensing pathways (p38-MAPK, mTOR SIRT1), thus disrupting hepatic insulin signaling without increasing expression key gluconeogenic enzymes.
