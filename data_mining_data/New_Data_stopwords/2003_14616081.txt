 Tightly coupled membranes Paracoccus denitrificans catalyze oxidative phosphorylation incapable ATP hydrolysis. conditions observation registration venturicidin-sensitive ATPase activity subbacterial particles derived organism described. ATP hydrolytic activity appear prolonged incubation presence pyruvate kinase phosphoenol pyruvate (to remove ADP), EDTA (to remove Mg2+) and/or inorganic phosphate, whereas activity dramatically increases energization membranes. ATP hydrolysis -activated ATPase coupled electric potential formation. Inorganic phosphate prevents azide promotes decline enzyme activity ATP hydrolysis. addition uncouplers results rapid complete inactivation ATPase. -dependent ATPase activity increases upon dilution membranes. results discussed evidence presence distinct ATP-synthase ATP-hydrolase states F(o)F(1) complex coupling membranes (Vinogradov, A. D. (1999) Biochemistry (Moscow), 64, 1219-1229). proposal made part free energy released oxidoreduction respiratory chain used maintain active conformation energy-transducing proteins.
