 revolution cancer genomics uncovered variety clinically relevant mutations primary brain tumours, creating urgent need develop non-invasive imaging biomarkers assess integrate genetic information clinical management patients. Metabolic reprogramming central hallmark cancer, including brain tumours; indeed, many molecular pathways implicated pathogenesis brain tumours result reprogramming metabolism. relationship provides opportunity devise vivo metabolic imaging modalities improve diagnosis, patient stratification, monitoring treatment response. Metabolic phenomena, Warburg effect altered mitochondrial metabolism, leveraged image brain tumours using techniques including PET MRI. Moreover, genetic alterations, mutations affecting isocitrate dehydrogenase, associated unique metabolic signatures detected using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. need translate understanding molecular features brain tumours imaging modalities clinical utility growing; metabolic imaging provides unique platform achieve objective. Review, examine molecular basis metabolic reprogramming brain tumours, examine current non-invasive metabolic imaging strategies used interrogate molecular characteristics ultimate goal guiding improving patient care.
