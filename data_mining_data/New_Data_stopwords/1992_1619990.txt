 Metabolic changes first 24 hours starvation studied rats previously adapted 3 weeks postweaning growth period low-protein diet using lactalbumin dietary protein source. Previous adaptation high-quality, low-protein diet reduced effects early starvation loss body liver weight. rats fed low-protein diet (6% lactalbumin, LP rats), free triiodothyronine (T3) concentration remained higher control rats (13% lactalbumin, C rats) throughout experiment (+38%, 24 hours), plasma insulin concentration, lower C rats first 6 hours (-56%), different thereafter. Plasma insulin glucagon molar ratio lower (-54%) liver cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration higher (+28%) LP C rats fed state, different 24 hours starvation. Plasma glucose concentration slightly lower LP C rats (-15%) fed state, different groups starvation. Whereas unchanged fed state, plasma lactate concentration lower (-57%) free fatty acid total ketone body concentrations higher (+38% +183%, respectively) LP C rats 24 hours starvation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
