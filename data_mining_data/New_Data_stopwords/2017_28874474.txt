 Heat tolerance well known key fungal survival many habitats, mechanistic understanding organisms adapt heat stress still incomplete. Using Metarhizium robertsii, emerging model organism assessing evolutionary processes, report pyruvate vanguard molecules scavenge heat-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). show that, well inducing rapid burst ROS production, heat stress also downregulates genes pyruvate consumption. accumulating pyruvate fastest acting several M. robertsii ROS scavengers, efficiently reducing protein carbonylation, stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential, promoting fungal growth. acetate produced pyruvate-ROS reactions causes acid stress, tolerance regulated Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Heat stress also induces pyruvate accumulation several fungi, suggesting scavenging heat-induced ROS pyruvate widespread.IMPORTANCE Heat dangerous challenge organisms, denatures proteins induces production ROS inactivate proteins, lipid membranes, DNA. organisms respond stress fully understood. Using experimentally tractable insect pathogen Metarhizium robertsii model organism, show first time heat stress induces pyruvate production functions first line defense heat-induced ROS. Heat stress also induces rapid pyruvate accumulation fungi, suggesting pyruvate common unappreciated defense stress.
