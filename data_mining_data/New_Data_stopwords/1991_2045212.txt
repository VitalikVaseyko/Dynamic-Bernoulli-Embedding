 Twenty obese 20 lean LA/N-cp male rats 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats fed diet containing either 54 percent sucrose starch six weeks. 14-16 hour fast, rats killed. Liver kidney enzyme activities determined LA/N-cp rats plasma urea selected amino acids determined rats. Liver glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PASE), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPASE), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), malic enzyme (ME), glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), glutamic-oxaloacetic-transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), arginase (ARGASE), arginine-synthase (ARG-SYN) ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) levels significantly affected phenotype (obese greater lean). changes enzyme levels exaggerated sucrose-feeding exception PK, PFK, GOT, GPT, ARGASE ARG-SYN. Kidney cortex G6PASE, PEPCK ARGASE activities higher obese rats compared lean littermates. Sucrose feeding resulted higher cortex G6PASE, FBPASE PEPCK compared starch-fed rats. phenotype effect noted plasma glutamate, urea, leucine, isoleucine valine (obese greater lean) diet effect seen aspartate, phenylalanine, leucine valine (sucrose greater starch) concentration. Sprague-Dawley rats higher plasma urea lower alanine lean LA/N-cp males. Metabolic obesity LA/N-cp rat appears involve elevated capacity pathways glycolysis, gluconeogensis, lipogenesis amino acid catabolism liver.
