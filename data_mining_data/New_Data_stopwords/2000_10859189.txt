 Viral infection often affects carbon assimilation metabolism host plants. better understand effect cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection sugar transport, carbohydrate levels amounts various sugars phloem sap determined infected melon (Cucumis melo L.) plants. Source leaves infected CMV characterized high concentrations reducing sugars relatively low starch levels. altered level carbohydrates accompanied increased respiration decreased net photosynthetic rates infected leaves. Although stachyose predominant sugar phloem sap collected petioles control leaves, sucrose (Suc) major sugar phloem sap infected leaves. Moreover, analyses newly fixed (14)CO(2) revealed high proportion radioactive Suc phloem sap infected leaves 60 min post-labeling. alteration phloem sap sugar composition found source, old, leaves. Moreover, elevations Suc concentration also evident source leaves exhibit symptoms contain detectable amounts virus particles. mode CMV infection may cause alterations sugar transport discussed terms mechanism sugars loaded phloem cucurbit plants.
