 identify molecular candidates involved brain disabilities Ts1Cje, mouse model syndrome (DS), performed comparative proteomic analyses. Proteins extracted brains postnatal wild-type (WT) Ts1Cje mice analyzed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). differences detected proteins expressed whole brain WT Ts1Cje mice postnatal day 0 3months age. Five spots differential expression brains Ts1Cje mice detected 2-DE brain proteins WT Ts1Cje embryos embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5). differentially expressed proteins Ts1Cje embryos identified calcyclin-binding protein (CACYBP), nucleoside diphosphate kinase-B (NDPK-B), transketolase (TK), pyruvate kinase (PK), 60S acidic ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) peptide mass fingerprinting. CACYBP NDPK-B involved cell proliferation, whereas TK PK associated energy metabolism. Experiments cell proliferation, vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeling experiment, immunohistochemical analysis phospho-histone H3 (an M-phase marker) demonstrated increased numbers BrdU-positive M-phase cells ganglionic eminence. findings suggest dysregulated expression proteins demonstrated comparative proteomic analysis could factor increased cell proliferation, may associated abnormalities DS brain embryonic life.
