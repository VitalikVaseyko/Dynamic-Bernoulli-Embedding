 Phenylketonuria (PKU) frequent inborn error metabolism. caused deficiency activity phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading accumulation phenylalanine metabolites. Untreated maternal PKU hyperphenylalaninemia may result nonphenylketonuric offspring low birth weight neonatal sequelae, especially microcephaly intellectual disability. mechanisms underlying neuropathology brain injury maternal PKU syndrome poorly understood. present study, evaluated possible preventive effect co-administration creatine plus pyruvate effects elicited phenylalanine administration female Wistar rats pregnancy lactation enzymes involved phosphoryltransfer network brain cortex hippocampus offspring 21 days age. Phenylalanine administration provoked diminution body, brain cortex hippocampus weight decrease adenylate kinase, mitochondrial cytosolic creatine kinase activities. Co-administration creatine plus pyruvate effective prevention alterations provoked phenylalanine, suggesting altered energy metabolism may important pathophysiology maternal PKU. alterations also occur maternal PKU, possible pyruvate creatine supplementation phenylalanine-restricted diet might beneficial phenylketonuric mothers.
