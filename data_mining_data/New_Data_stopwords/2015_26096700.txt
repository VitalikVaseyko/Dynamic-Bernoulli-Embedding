 Flavonoids, well-documented secondary metabolites many vegetables plants, exhibit antiinflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anticancer activities. However, cytotoxic effects human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected cytoprotective macrophages studied. present study, investigated effects molecular mechanisms. Treatment flavonoids presence lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/cycloheximide (CHX) potently eliminated HIV-1 Tat-transduced cytoprotective human microglial CHME5 cells; 5,7-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-flavonoids oroxylin tectorigenin, concentration 10 muM, potently eliminated cytoprotective phenotype. flavonoids eliminated Tat-transduced CHME5 cells, D3-transfected CHME5 cells, HIV-1 D3-infected human primary macrophages, dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, oroxylin tectorigenin potently inhibited LPS/CHX-induced phosphorylation phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1, Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta Tat-transduced cells, D3-transfected CHME5 cells, D3-infected human primary macrophages. Based findings, 5,7-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-flavonoids may eliminate HIV-1 infected cytoprotective macrophages inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway deliver anti-HIV-1 effects vivo shortening lifespan infected macrophages.
