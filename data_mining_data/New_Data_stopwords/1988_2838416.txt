 Pyruvate kinase (PK) four isozymes (L, R, M1, M2) encoded two different genes PK L M. Differential splicing produces L- R-type PK mRNA M1- M2-type PK mRNA PK L gene PK gene, respectively. nucleotide sequences 3'-noncoding region L- R-type PK M1- M2-type PK. isolated 3'-noncoding sequences human L- M2-type PK cDNA construct L-type M-type PK specific probes. probes, performed Northern blot analysis RNA samples extracted human tissues. Northern blot analysis showed kidney liver mRNAs hybridized L probes. Small intestine, skeletal muscle, brain, testis, lung mRNAs hybridized probe. probes considered useful detection types PK isozymes expressed small amounts, difficult detect using conventional PK polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic method.
