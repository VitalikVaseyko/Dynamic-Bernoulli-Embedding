 Postmortem glycolysis directly linked incidences PSE (pale, soft, exudative) DFD (dark, firm, dry) meats, cause significant economic loss meat industry. However, mechanisms controlling postmortem glycolysis unclear. objective study determine role beta-adrenoceptor signaling AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) postmortem glycolysis. Eighteen 2 month old C57BL/6J female mice randomly separated three groups. Group received intraperitoneal injection saline solution served control; group II received saline injection forced swim 1 min; group III received injection propranolol (1 mg/kg) saline. addition, six C57BL/6J female AMPK knockout mice assigned group IV, received saline injection forced swim 1 min. longissimus dorsi muscle sampled 0, 1, 24 h postmortem pH enzyme activity measurements. objective elucidate roles beta-adrenoceptor signaling AMPK glycolysis postmortem muscle. Results showed AMPK activity major role determining ultimate muscle pH, ultimate pH control mice 6.16 AMPK knockout mice 6.48. beta-adrenoceptor signaling essential initial rapid glycolysis. Blocking beta-adrenoceptor signaling prevented initial pH decline induced stress. Activation beta-adrenoceptor signaling due preslaughter stress activates glycogen phosphorylase, resulting rapid glycolysis shortly slaughter. hand, activation AMPK important maintaining activity glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate kinase, leading sustained glycolysis low ultimate pH.
