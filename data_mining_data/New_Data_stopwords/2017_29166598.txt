 discovered induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones generated aged tissue donors (A-iPSCs) fail suppress oxidative phosphorylation. Compared embryonic stem cells (ESCs) iPSCs generated young donors (Y-iPSCs), A-iPSCs show poor expression pluripotent stem cell-specific glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) impaired glucose uptake, making unable support high glucose demands glycolysis. Persistent oxidative phosphorylation A-iPSCs generates higher levels reactive oxygen species (ROS), leads excessive elevation glutathione (a ROS-scavenging metabolite) blunted DNA damage response. phenotypes recapitulated Y-iPSCs inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) supplying citrate activate oxidative phosphorylation. addition, oxidative phosphorylation A-iPSC clones depletes citrate, nuclear source acetyl group donors histone acetylation; consequently alters histone acetylation status. Expression GLUT3 A-iPSCs recovers metabolic defect, DNA damage response, histone acetylation status.
