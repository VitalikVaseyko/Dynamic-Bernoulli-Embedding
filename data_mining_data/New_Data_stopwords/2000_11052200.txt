 Alterations gene expression early stages dormancy release grapevine buds analyzed facilitate identification gene products may mediate signal transduction dormancy-release signal, derepression meristematic activity. present report describe identification GDBRPK, transcript SNF-like protein kinase up-regulated upon chemical induction dormancy release hydrogen cyanamide (HC). Since SNF SNF-like protein kinases known sensors stress signals, hypothesize GDBRPK may involved perception stress signal induced HC. also describe simultaneous remarkable induction PDC ADH transcripts observed shortly HC application, transient nature. data may imply HC application leads transient respiratory stress, likely results temporary increase AMP/ATP ratio. Since AMP known stress signal sensed SNF-like kinases, suggest SNF-like GDBRPK could serve sensor signal.
