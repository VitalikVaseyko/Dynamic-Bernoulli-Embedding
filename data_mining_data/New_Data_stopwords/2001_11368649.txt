 Activities enzymes involved hepatic fatty acid oxidation synthesis among rats fed sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) differing lignan content (sesamin sesamolin) compared. Sesame seeds rich lignans two lines, 0730 0732, lines established laborary, conventional cultivar (Masekin) employed. Seeds 0730 0732 lines contained sesamin sesamolin amounts twice Masekin. Sesame seeds added levels 200 g/kg experimental diets. Sesame increased hepatic mitochondrial peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation rate. Increases greater sesame rich lignans Maskin. Noticeably, peroxisomal activity levels >3 times higher rats fed diets containing sesame seeds 0730 0732 lines fed control diet without sesame. diet containing Masekin seed caused 50% increase value, however. Diets containing seeds 0730 0732 lines, compared control Masekin diets, also significantly increased activity hepatic fatty acid oxidation enzymes including acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyltranferase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. contrast, diets containing sesame lowered activity enzymes involved fatty acid synthesis including fatty acid synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, ATP-citrate lyase, pyruvate kinase. significant differences enzyme activities were, however, seen among diets containing sesame Masekin cultivar lines 0730 0732. Serum triacylglycerol concentrations lower rats fed diets containing sesame lines 0730 0732 fed control Masekin diet. apparent sesame rich lignans profoundly affects hepatic fatty acid oxidation serum triacylglycerol levels. Therefore, consumption sesame rich lignans results physiological activity alter lipid metabolism potentially beneficial manner.
