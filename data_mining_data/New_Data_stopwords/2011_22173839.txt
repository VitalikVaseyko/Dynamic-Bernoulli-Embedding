 UNLABELLED: Recently, renewed interest study tumor metabolism beyond Warburg effect. Studies cancer cell metabolism provided evidence tumor-specific activation signaling pathways, upregulation oncogene myc, regulate glutamine uptake metabolism glutaminolysis provide cancer cell replacement energy source. METHODS: report convenient procedure prepare l-[5-(11)C]-glutamine. tracer evaluated 9L SF188 tumor cells (glioma astrocytoma cell lines). biodistribution l-[5-(11)C]-glutamine rodent tumor models investigated dissection PET. RESULTS: reacting (11)C-cyanide ion protected 4-iodo-2-amino-butanoic ester, key intermediate obtained good yield. hydrolysis trifluoroacetic sulfonic acids, desired optically pure l-[5-(11)C]-glutamine obtained (radiochemical yield, 5% end synthesis; radiochemical purity, >95%). Tumor cell uptake studies showed maximum uptake l-[5-(11)C]-glutamine reached 17.9% 22.5% per 100 mug protein, respectively, 60 min 9L SF188 tumor cells. 30 min incubation, 30% activity appeared incorporated cellular protein. Biodistribution normal mice showed l-[5-(11)C]-glutamine significant pancreas uptake (7.37 percentage injected dose per gram 15 min), likely due exocrine function high protein turnover within pancreas. Heart uptake rapid, 3.34 percentage injected dose per gram remaining 60 min injection. Dynamic small-animal PET studies rats bearing xenografted 9L tumors transgenic mice bearing spontaneous mammary gland tumors showed prominent tumor uptake retention. CONCLUSION: data demonstrated tracer favorably taken tumor models. results suggest l-[5-(11)C]-glutamine might useful probing vivo tumor metabolism glutaminolytic tumors.
