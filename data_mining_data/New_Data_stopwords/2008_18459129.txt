 UNLABELLED: Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme (CoA) dehydrogenase (MCAD) catalyzes crucial steps mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, process key relevance maintenance energy homeostasis, especially high metabolic demand. gain insight metabolic consequences MCAD deficiency conditions, compared hepatic carbohydrate metabolism vivo wild-type MCAD(-/-) mice fasting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute phase response (APR). MCAD(-/-) mice become hypoglycemic fasting APR wild-type mice did. Nevertheless, microarray analyses revealed increased hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (Pgc-1alpha) decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Ppar alpha) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) expression MCAD(-/-) mice conditions, suggesting altered control hepatic glucose metabolism. Quantitative flux measurements revealed de novo synthesis glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) affected fasting MCAD(-/-) mice. APR, however, flux significantly decreased (-20%) MCAD(-/-) mice compared wild-type mice. Remarkably, newly formed G6P preferentially directed toward glycogen MCAD(-/-) mice conditions. Together diminished de novo synthesis G6P, led decreased hepatic glucose output APR MCAD(-/-) mice; de novo synthesis G6P hepatic glucose output maintained wild-type mice conditions. APR-associated hypoglycemia, observed wild-type mice well MCAD(-/-) mice, mainly due enhanced peripheral glucose uptake. CONCLUSION: data demonstrate MCAD deficiency mice leads specific changes hepatic carbohydrate management exposure metabolic stress. deficiency, however, lead reduced de novo synthesis G6P fasting alone, may due existence compensatory mechanisms limited rate control MCAD murine mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.
