 somatic hybrids fibroblast microcells rat hepatoma cells, tissue-specific extinguisher 1 (TSE1), localized mouse chromosome 11, extinguishes expression tyrosine aminotransferase phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase. Recently, demonstrated TSE1 corresponds R1 alpha, regulatory subunit protein kinase A. Here, analyzed whether R1 alpha could play role differentiation hepatocyte. known TSE1/R1 alpha target genes belong group neonatal functions repressed birth. High expression R1 alpha characterizes fetal-type BW1J hepatoma cells neonatal target genes silent. R1 alpha active trans extinguish genes hybrids BW1J Fao adult-type rat hepatoma cells. Reexpression target genes correlated loss R1 alpha and/or overexpression mRNA hepatocyte-enriched transcription factors HNF4 HNF3 alpha. Phenylalanine hydroxylase shown another function negatively regulated R1 alpha. BW cells expression phenylalanine hydroxylase activated (after either 5-aza-cytidine treatment transfection genomic DNA adult-type hepatoma cells), down-regulation R1 alpha expression occurs: independent mechanism overcomes R1 alpha repression. Finally, dedifferentiated derivatives adult-type rat hepatoma cells express neither R1 alpha target genes R1 alpha gene itself. Thus, three different situations modulation R1 alpha expression could anticipated, fails occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
