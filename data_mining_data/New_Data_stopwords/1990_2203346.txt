 produced transgenic mice carrying 3 kb 5'-flanking sequence rat pyruvate kinase L gene linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) structural gene. Expression transgene observed tissues endogenous L-type pyruvate kinase expressed. Dietary glucose insulin induced similar increases levels CAT L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs liver. However, fructose-induced level CAT mRNA 3- 6- fold lower endogenous L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA liver kidney, respectively, confirming previous finding stabilization transcripts pyruvate kinase L gene important regulatory step fructose induction, especially kidney. Thus conclude cis-acting elements responsible tissue-specific expression L-type pyruvate kinase stimulation dietary components insulin localized sequence nucleotide -3000 +37 pyruvate kinase L gene.
