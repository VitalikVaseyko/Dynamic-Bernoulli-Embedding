 cardiac-enriched isoform acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC2) key regulator mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) uptake via carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). test hypothesis oxidative metabolism upregulated hearts animals lacking ACC2 (employing transgenic Acc2-mutant mouse), assessed cardiac function vivo determined rates myocardial substrate oxidation ex vivo. examined echocardiography, difference systolic function, left ventricular mass Acc2-mutant (MUT) mouse significantly reduced ( approximately 25%) compared wild-types (WT). Reduced activation mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) downstream target p70S6K found MUT hearts. Exogenous oxidation rates oleate increased approximately 22%, and, unexpectedly, exogenous glucose oxidation rates also increased MUT hearts. Using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, found glucose uptake MUT hearts increased approximately 83%. Myocardial triglyceride levels significantly reduced MUT vs. WT glycogen content same. parallel, transcript levels PPARalpha target genes, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4), malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD), mCPT1, downregulated MUT mice. summary, report 1) Acc2-mutant hearts exhibit marked preference oxidation glucose FAs coupled greater utilization endogenous fuel substrates (triglycerides), 2) attenuated mTOR signaling may result reduced heart sizes observed Acc2-mutant mice, 3) Acc2-mutant hearts displayed normal functional parameters despite significant decrease size.
