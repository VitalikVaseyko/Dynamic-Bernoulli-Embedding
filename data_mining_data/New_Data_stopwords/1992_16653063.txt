 coding sequence cytosolic isozyme potato tuber pyruvate kinase (PK) attached transit peptide small subunit pea ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase placed control cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. construct transformed Nicotiana tabacum. Unexpectedly, two primary transformants recovered PK activity leaves greatly reduced. reduction PK activity appeared result complete absence cytosolic form enzyme (PK(c)). addition, PK(c) could detected western blots leaf extracts. Metabolite analyses indicated levels phosphoenolpyruvate substantially higher PK(c)-deficient leaves wild-type leaves, consistent block glycolysis step catalyzed PK. PK(c) deficiency leaves appear adversely affect plant growth. Analysis progeny indicates PK(c) deficiency heritable trait. leaves PK(c)-deficient transformants normal rates photosynthetic O(2) evolution respiratory O(2) consumption, indicating plants using alternative pathways bypass PK.
