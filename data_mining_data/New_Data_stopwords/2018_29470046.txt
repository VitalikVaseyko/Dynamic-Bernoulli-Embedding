 explore new series cathode materials high electrochemical performance, spinel-layered (1 - x)[LiCrMnO4]. x[Li2MnO3.LiCrO2] ( x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) composites synthesized sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, Raman spectra reveal structure (1 - x)[LiCrMnO4]. x[Li2MnO3.LiCrO2] cathode materials evolves spinel hybrid spinel-layered layered structures increase Li concentration. Test results reveal structure electrochemical performance (1 - x)[LiCrMnO4]. x[Li2MnO3.LiCrO2] ( x = 0.25, 0.5 0.75) composites characteristics spinel ( x = 0) Li-rich layered phases ( x = 1). particular, x = 0.5 0.75 electrodes exhibit relatively high capacity retention rate capability, mainly ascribed synergistic effect spinel Li-rich layered phases, 3D Li-ion diffusion channels spinel phase, low charge-transfer resistance ( Rct) Warburg diffusion impedance ( Wo).
