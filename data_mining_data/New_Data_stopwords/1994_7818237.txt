 Tyrphostins inhibit tyrosine kinases little effect activity serine/threonine kinases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylating serine residues within multienzyme complex. serine/theronine kinase represents new family protein kinases, one (tyrphostin 47) two tyrphostins tested appeared activate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase determined [1-14C]-lactate oxidation 14CO2. Experiments designed determine tyrphostins altered pyruvate dehydrogenase activity mitochondria prepared rat epididymal adipocytes using [1-14C]-pyruvate substrate demonstrated dose dependent increase enzyme activity presence tyrphostin 47, tyrphostin 23. apparent stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase activity attributed tyrphostin 47's ability nonenzymatically decarboxylate [1-14C]-pyruvate, substrate pyruvate dehydrogenase assay. Neither tyrphostin directly altered pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity. Therefore, assays utilizing [1-14C]-pyruvate tyrphostin 47 subject analytical interference.
