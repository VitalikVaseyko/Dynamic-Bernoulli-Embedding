 atypical pyruvate kinase (PK) erythrocytes studied family several different haematological diseases: non-spherocytic haemolysis, thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis polycythaemic traits. Atypical intraerythrocytic PK also found group non-related patients myelofibrosis polycythaemia vera. atypical PK characterised abnormal urea inhibition relevant biochemical parameters.
