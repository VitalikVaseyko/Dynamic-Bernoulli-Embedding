 Although acetate biosynthesis Escherichia coli provides important intermediary ATP synthesis, accumulation inhibits cell growth protein production. Since pyruvate provides largest flux acetate central problem acetate production, acetate accumulation could reduced abolished pyruvate pool TCA cycle reduced. examine possibility, various pyruvate kinase (pyk) phosphotransferase system (pts) mutants tested acetate production batch cultures glucose carbon source. pykA pykF mutant exhibited significant reductions specific growth rate acetate production compared wild-type strain. Interestingly, case pts pts pyk mutants increased biomass yields observed comparison wild-type strain, acetate production detected. Therefore, mutants potentially useful higher production recombinant proteins. results continuous cultivation performed using wild-type strain various dilution rates, suggest acetate reduction consequence genetic changes growth rate diminutions.
