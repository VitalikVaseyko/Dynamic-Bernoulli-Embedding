 Aerobic glycolysis supports proliferation unresolved mechanisms. previously shown aerobic glycolysis required regulated proliferation cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNP) growth CGNP-derived medulloblastoma. Blocking initiation glycolysis via deletion hexokinase-2 (Hk2) disrupts CGNP proliferation restricts medulloblastoma growth. Here, assessed whether disrupting pyruvate kinase-M (Pkm), enzyme acts terminal steps glycolysis, would alter CGNP metabolism, proliferation, tumorigenesis. observed dichotomous pattern PKM expression, postmitotic neurons throughout brain expressed constitutively active PKM1 isoform, neural progenitors medulloblastomas exclusively expressed less active PKM2. Isoform-specific Pkm2 deletion CGNPs blocked Pkm expression. Pkm2-deleted CGNPs showed reduced lactate production increased SHH-driven proliferation. (13)C-flux analysis showed Pkm2 deletion reduced flow glucose carbons lactate glutamate without markedly increasing glucose-to-ribose flux. Pkm2 deletion accelerated tumor formation medulloblastoma-prone ND2:SmoA1 mice, indicating disrupting PKM releases CGNPs tumor-suppressive effect. findings show distal proximal disruptions glycolysis opposite effects proliferation, efforts block oncogenic effect aerobic glycolysis must target reactions upstream PKM.
