 Control glycolysis anoxia investigated five organs (heart, brain, liver, red white skeletal muscles) freshwater turtle, Pseudemys scripta, 1 5 h submergence N2-bubbled water. Lactate produced metabolic end product, distinct organ differences amount (net lactate accumulation 2.4-fold higher brain white muscle) rate (lactate production liver dropped 16-fold 1st h) lactate accumulation. ATP total adenylate contents organs reduced (by 15-32%) 1 h submergence, energy charge maintained; 5 h, adenylate contents fully recovered. Changes levels hexose triose phosphate intermediates glycolysis indicated activation glycolysis within 1st h anoxia exposure brain, heart, skeletal muscles. 5 h, however, reversed, glycolytic rate depression indicated, consistent overall metabolic rate depression accompanying long-term anaerobiosis turtle. Crossover analysis indicated glycolytic control pyruvate kinase reaction organs glycolytic activation metabolic depression; regulatory control phosphofructokinase locus primarily important glycolytic activation heart red muscle. analysis indicated rapid glycolytic inhibition liver occurring within 1st h anoxia exposure; allows glycogenolysis directed toward glucose export yielding fermentative fuel used organs anoxia.
