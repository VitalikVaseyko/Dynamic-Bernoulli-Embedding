 compound class 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines identified using HTS potent inhibitors facilitated glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Extensive structure-activity relationship studies (SAR) ring system molecular framework established revealing essential structural motives (i.e., ortho-methoxy substituted benzene, piperazine pyrimidine). selectivity GLUT2 excellent initial vitro vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) studies encouraging.
