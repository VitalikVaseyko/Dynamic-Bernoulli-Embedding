 effects tryptophan (Trp) phenylalanine (Phe) diet supplementation stress metabolism Atlantic cod studied. Fish fed diet supplemented Trp Phe control diet 1 week. end feeding trial, fish subjected air exposure heat shock. Following samples blood, liver muscle taken fish analyzed stress metabolic indicators. air exposure, plasma cortisol levels fish fed Trp Phe diets lower compared fish fed control diet. Diets containing amino acids increased significantly liver transaminase activities juvenile cod. thermal stress, high Trp contents significant effects fructose biphosphatase activity though Phe not. Overall, activities glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase increased significantly amino acid diets. thermal stress, fish highest values activities 3Trp diet. Trp content diet significant effects transaminase activity muscle air stress compared fish fed control Phe diets. Muscle alanine transaminase activity thermal stress fish fed diet significantly different control. Trp Phe supplementations reduced stress markers cod; hence, could used additives stress attenuation. However, also raised activity key enzymes glycolysis gluconeogenesis, mainly Trp diets.
