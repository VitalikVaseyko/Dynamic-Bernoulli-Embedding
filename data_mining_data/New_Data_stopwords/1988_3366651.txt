 describe enzyme histochemical multistep technique demonstration pyruvate kinase activity. technique, semipermeable membrane interposed incubation medium tissue sections, thus preventing diffusion enzyme medium incubation period. histochemical system, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) donates phosphate group ADP reaction catalysed pyruvate kinase. Next, exogenous endogenous hexokinase catalyses reaction ATP D-glucose yield D-glucose-6-phosphate ADP. D-glucose-6-phosphate oxidized exogenous endogenous D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, concomitantly, generated electrons transported via NADP+, phenazine methosulphate menadione nitro-BT, finally precipitated formazan. Sodium azide amytal included block electron transfer cytochromes. method proved value qualitative demonstration pyruvate kinase activity tissue sections kidneys, heart muscle skeletal muscle. quantitative studies investigating activity enzyme liver sections, method cannot recommended.
