 Adenosine directly linked energy metabolism cells. central nervous system (CNS) increase neuronal activity enhances energy consumption well extracellular adenosine concentrations. brain areas high extracellular adenosine concentrations, A1 adenosine receptors, decrease neuronal activity thus need energy. Adenosine may final common pathway various sleep factors. identified relatively specific area, basal forebrain (BF), appears central regulation/execution recovery sleep sleep deprivation (SD), prolonged wakefulness. Adenosine concentration increases area SD, increase induces sleep prevention increase SD abolishes recovery sleep. increase adenosine associated local changes energy metabolism indicated increases levels pyruvate lactate increased phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase. increases adenosine sleep associated intact cholinergic system since specific lesion BF cholinergic cells abolishes both. Whether adenosine SD produced cholinergic neurons astrocytes associated remains explored. interesting, far unexplored question regards relationship local, cortical regulation sleep homeostasis global regulation state sleep executed lower brain mechanisms, including BF. increase adenosine concentration SD also cortical areas suggests adenosine may role local regulation sleep homeostasis. core sleep need probably related primitive functions life, like energy metabolism. noted assumption way excludes possibility later evolution additional functions may developed, e.g., related complex neuronal network functions like memory learning.
