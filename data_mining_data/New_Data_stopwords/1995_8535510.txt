 induction chitinolytic enzymes biocontrol agent Trichoderma harzianum parasitism Sclerotium rolfsii role fungal-fungal recognition process studied. change chitinolytic enzyme profile detected interaction fungi, grown dual culture synthetic medium. coming contact other, fungi contained protein constitutive 1,4-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity. early 12 h contact, chitinolytic activity S. rolfsii disappeared, T. harzianum (a protein molecular mass 102 kDa, CHIT 102) greatly increased. 24 h interaction, activity CHIT 102 diminished concomitantly appearance 73 kDa 1,4-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, became clear strong 48 h. phenomenon occur S. rolfsii mycelium autoclaved prior incubation T. harzianum, suggesting dependence vital elements host. Cycloheximide inhibited phenomenon, indicating de novo synthesis enzymes taking place Trichoderma stages parasitism. biomimetic system based binding purified surface lectin host S. rolfsii nylon fibres used dissect effect recognition. increase CHIT 102 activity detected, suggesting induction chitinolytic enzymes Trichoderma early event elicited recognition signal (i.e. lectin-carbohydrate interactions). postulated recognition first step cascade antagonistic events triggers parasitic response Trichoderma.
