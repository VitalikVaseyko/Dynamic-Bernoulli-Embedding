 previous study demonstrated 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) administered mice stimulates oxidative phosphorylation upregulation mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX). present study investigated whether ALA disrupts Warburg effect, represents shift ATP generation oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, protecting tumor cells oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. human lung carcinoma cell line A549 exposed ALA exhibited enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, indicated increase COX protein expression oxygen consumption. Furthermore, ALA suppressed glycolysis-mediated acidosis. normalization ATP metabolic pathways significantly increased generation superoxide anion radical (O2*-) functional expression active caspase-3, leading caspase-dependent apoptosis. data demonstrate ALA inhibits Warburg effect induces cancer cell death. Use endogenous compound might constitute novel approach cancer therapy.
