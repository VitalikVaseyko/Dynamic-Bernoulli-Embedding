 Severe hemolytic anemia Basenji dogs secondary pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency corrected marrow allografts healthy littermates conventional high-dose myeloablative conditioning regimen. nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen used here, consisted sublethal dose 200 cGy total body irradiation immunosuppression mycophenolate mofetil cyclosporine dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical littermate allograft, found effective establishing stable mixed donor/host hematopoietic chimerism normal dogs. explored feasibility nonmyeloablative marrow allografts treatment canine PK deficiency studied effect stable allogeneic mixed hematopoietic chimerism natural course disease. Five affected dogs received transplants, 3 dogs advanced liver cirrhosis myelofibrosis. complications presumed due iron overload. 5 dogs showed initial engraftment. Two rejected grafts 6 weeks survived completeautologous marrow recovery return disease. One died liver failure day 27 60% donor engraftment. Two dogs shown sustained mixed donor/host chimerism year 85% 12% donor hematopoietic cells, respectively. Overall clinical response correlated degree donor chimerism. dog low degree chimerism achieved partial resolution hemolysis, disease symptoms persisted manifested increasing iron overload resulting progression marrow liver fibrosis. dog high degree donor chimerism achieved almost complete resolution hemolysis decrease marrow iron content resolution marrow fibrosis. observations suggest mixed hematopoietic chimerism relatively safely established dogs PK deficiency even presence advanced liver cirrhosis. However, although effective correcting delaying development myelofibrosis, low degree mixed chimerism sufficient prevent continued hemolysis red blood cells host origin. Complete donor chimerism appears necessary achieve long-term cure.
