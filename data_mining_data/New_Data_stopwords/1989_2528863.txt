 Eight different enzymes glycolysis alcoholic fermentation overproduced common Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain placing genes multicopy vectors. specific enzyme activities increased 3.7- 13.9-fold wild-type level. overproduction different glycolytic enzymes effect rate ethanol formation, even enzymes catalyse irreversible steps: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Also simultaneous increase activities pairs enzymes pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase pyruvate decarboxylase alcohol dehydrogenase, increase rate ethanol production. levels key glycolytic metabolites also normal, compared reference strain.
