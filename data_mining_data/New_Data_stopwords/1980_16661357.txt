 Isozymes pyruvate kinase (PK) isolated developing castor bean endosperm. One isozyme, PK(c), localized cytosol, other, PK(p), plastid. isozymes need monovalent divalent cations activity, requirements filled K(+) Mg(2+). isozymes inhibited citrate, pyruvate, ATP. PK(c) much broader pH profile PK(p) also stable. K(m) (0.05 millimolar) PEP, PK(p) 10-fold higher K(m) (0.3 millimolar) ADP PK(c) (0.03 millimolar). PK(c) also higher affinity alternate nucleotide substrates PK(p). two isozymes different kinetic mechanisms. ordered sequential mechanism bind phosphoenolpyruvate ADP. However, plastid isozyme releases ATP first, whereas pyruvate first product released cytosolic enzyme. properties two isozymes similar counterparts green tissue.
