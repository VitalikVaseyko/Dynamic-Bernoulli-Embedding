 BACKGROUND AIMS: Obesity-driven lipotoxicity risk factors cardiovascular disease. Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) bile acids sensor member nuclear receptor superfamily. Activation FXR lowers plasma triacylglycerols glucose levels mechanism involves repression key regulatory genes liver modulation insulin sensitivity peripheral tissues. present study investigated whether administering obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats, genetic model obesity associated dyslipidemia insulin resistance, FXR ligand protects lipid-induced cardiomyopathy. METHODS RESULTS: FXR expressed neonatal cardiomyocytes treatment FXR agonists, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), GW4064, increased mRNA expression FXR canonical target gene, small heterodimer partner (SHP), well proliferator-activated receptor alpha PPARalpha, acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK-4). Feeding obese fa/fa rats CDCA, 12 weeks, reduced hyperinsulinemia hyperlipidaemia. histological-pathological analysis hearts demonstrated treatment FXR ligand reduced lipid heart content decreased rate apoptosis, fibrosis scores restored heart insulin signalling. Chronic CDCA administration, heart, induced PPARalpha PPARalpha-regulated genes involved beta-oxidation. CONCLUSION: FXR agonism exerts beneficial effects genetic model lipid-induced cardiomyopathy. striking benefit therapy cardiac function model warrants effort determine whether counterpart activity translates human settings.
