 Alcohol use, particularly excessive alcohol consumption one serious health risks world. relationship sport, exercise alcohol consumption clear long-standing. Alcohol continues frequently consumed drug among athletes habitual exercisers alcohol-related problems appear common individuals. Alcohol use directly linked rate injury sustained sport events appears evoke detrimental effects exercise performance capacity. model alcohol consumption human experimental studies either acute (single dose) chronic (repeated doses period). studies suggested alcohol consumption decreases use glucose amino acids skeletal muscles, adversely affects energy supply impairs metabolic process exercise. addition, chronic alcohol use associated increased citrate synthase activity decreased cross-sectional area type I, IIa IIb fibres. evidence suggest exercise may attenuate ethanol-induced decline hepatic mitochondria accelerates ethanol metabolism liver. Exercise training seems reduce extent oxidative damage caused ethanol. Evidence generated vitro experiments animal studies also suggested ethanol administration decreased skeletal muscle capillarity increased pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activities. Substantial epidemiological evidence accrued showing moderate ingestion alcohol may reduce incidence cardiovascular diseases. Although existing evidence often confusing disparate, one mechanisms alcohol may reduce incidence mortality cardiovascular diseases raising levels high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Available evidence suggests exercise moderate alcohol consumption may favourable effects blood coagulation fibrinolysis; however, compelling experimental evidence lacking endorse notion. Occasional chronic alcohol consumption usually linked unfavourable alterations platelet aggregation function may associated platelet-related thrombus formation. Although effects alcohol consumption rheological properties blood known, recent experimental evidence suggests alcohol use following exercise associated unfavourable changes main determinants blood viscosity. well documented alcohol use modulates immune system impairs host defence. Compelling evidence also mounting suggest chronic alcohol use linked adverse effects body systems organs including brain, cardiovascular system liver.
