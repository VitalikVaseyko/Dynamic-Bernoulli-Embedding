 BACKGROUND: Fecal biomarkers, especially fecal calprotectin, useful predicting endoscopic activity Crohn's disease; however, cut-off point remains unclear. aim paper analyze whether faecal calprotectin M2 pyruvate kinase good tools generating highly accurate scores prediction state endoscopic activity mucosal healing. METHODS: simple endoscopic score Crohn's disease Crohn's disease activity index calculated 71 patients diagnosed Crohn's. Fecal calprotectin M2-PK measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. RESULTS: fecal calprotectin cut-off concentration >/= 170 microg/g (sensitivity 77.6%, specificity 95.5% likelihood ratio +17.06) predicts high probability endoscopic activity, fecal calprotectin cut-off </= 71 microg/g (sensitivity 95.9%, specificity 52.3% likelihood ratio -0.08) predicts high probability mucosal healing. Three clinical groups identified according data obtained: endoscopic activity (calprotectin >/= 170), mucosal healing (calprotectin </= 71) uncertainty (71 > calprotectin < 170), significant differences endoscopic values (F = 26.407, p < 0.01). Clinical activity remission modified probabilities presenting endoscopic activity (100% vs 89%) mucosal healing (75% vs 87%) diagnostic scores generated. M2-PK insufficiently accurate determine scores. CONCLUSIONS: highly accurate scores fecal calprotectin provide useful tool interpreting probabilities presenting endoscopic activity mucosal healing, valuable specific clinical context.
