 previous research revealed dissolved oxygen limitation favorable vitamin B12 fermentation, due inducement increased glycolytic flux Pseudomonas denitrificans. paper, novel strategy implemented investigate metabolic characteristics P. denitrificans different oxygen supply levels, exogenously adding rotenone (a respiratory chain inhibitor interfering oxygen consumption) fermentation broths. Compared fermentation process without rotenone treatment, observed 5 mg/L rotenone treatment could significantly strengthen glycolytic flux P. denitrificans via activating key glycolytic enzymes (phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase), resulting accelerated generations anterior precursors (glutamate 5-aminolevulinic acid) vitamin B12 biosynthesis. Although 5 mg/L rotenone treatment negative effect cell growth P. denitrificans, vitamin B12 yield increased 48.28 +/- 0.62 mg/L 54.70 +/- 0.45 mg/L, proved increased glycolytic flux P. denitrificans consequence higher vitamin B12 production.
