 Diploid androgenetic mouse embryos, possessing two sets paternally inherited chromosomes, control fertilized embryos used examine relative effects X chromosome number parental chromosome origin androgenone viability X-linked gene expression. significant difference efficiency blastocyst formation observed XX XY androgenones experiments, difference uniformly observed. Significant effects X chromosome number parental origin X-linked gene expression observed. Male female control embryos expressed XIST: RNA initially. expression followed preferential reduction XIST: RNA abundance male embryos, indicating dosage compensation X chromosome may normally require downregulation XIST: RNA expression male embryos, conjunction production stable XIST: transcripts female embryos. late blastocyst stage, XX control embryos expressed significantly XIST: RNA XY embryos. Unlike normal counterparts, XX androgenones express significantly XIST: RNA XY androgenones late blastocyst stage. Androgenones exhibited severe repression Pgk1 gene, development late blastocyst stage Pgk1 mRNA expression increased XX androgenones decreased XY androgenones. Thus, initial repression Pgk1 gene XX androgenones lost XIST: RNA declined abundance, loss correlated failure XX androgenones express significantly XIST: RNA XY androgenones. results indicate androgenones may lack factor expressed maternal genome required dosage compensation preimplantation embryos. results also indicate early dosage compensation preimplantation embryos may normally reversible, thus providing flexibility meet different developmental requirements embryonic extraembryonic lineages.
