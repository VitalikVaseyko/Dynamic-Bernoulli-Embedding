 Although bacterium E. coli chosen host many bioprocesses, accumulation common byproduct, acetate, often problematic. Acetate, present high levels, inhibit cell growth recombinant protein productivity. addition, products derived central aerobic metabolic pathway often compete acetate-producing pathways poxB ackA-pta glucose substrate. such, significant portion glucose may excreted acetate, wasting substrate otherwise could used desired product. created mutant E. coli strains deletion either poxB ackA-pta pathway. two strains, along wild-type strain, studied batch reactors 12 h time period, pH 7.0 6.0. wild-type strain also studied using glucose carbon source. Data collected correlate cellular growth, extracellular metabolite production, enzyme activity, gene expression. Results show ackA-pta pathway dominates exponential phase, poxB pathway dominates stationary phase. ackA-pta pathway repressed acidic environments, whereas poxB pathway activated.
