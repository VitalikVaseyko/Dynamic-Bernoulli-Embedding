 isolated rat hepatocytes, previously reported rise ATP content induces proportional increase cytosolic NAD+ concentration [Devin, A., Guerin, B. & Rigoulet, M. (1997) FEBS Lett. 410, 329-332]. occurs physiological conditions various substrates different energetic states. investigate effect physiological rise cytosolic [NAD+] per se glycolysis gluconeogenesis, increase [NAD+] induced exogenous nicotinamide addition obtained without change redox potential, ATP/ADP ratio ATP concentration. Using dihydroxyacetone substrate, found increase cytosolic [NAD+] decreases gluconeogenesis enhances glycolysis without significant alteration dihydroxyacetone consumption rate. modifications consequence allosteric activation pyruvate kinase via cytosolic NAD+ content. Thus, addition well-known thermodynamic control glycolysis pyridine-nucleotide redox status, study points new mechanism glycolytic flux regulation NAD+ concentration level pyruvate kinase activity.
