 activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, enolase pyruvate kinase studied breast cancer metastases occurring various sites compared enzyme activities series primary breast cancers. activities enzymes studied significantly higher metastases compared primary tumors (p less equal 0.05). However, changes isoenzyme patterns enolase pyruvate kinase observed metastases compared primary breast cancers. Differences location metastases lead differences enzyme activities. data suggest association increasing rate glycolysis tumor progression.
