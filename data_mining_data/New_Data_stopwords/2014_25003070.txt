 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) emerging target treatment metabolic syndrome. maintain steady-state concentration adenosine triphosphate feed-fast cycle, cells require efficient utilization fatty acid glucose, controlled PDC. PDC converts pyruvate, coenzyme (CoA), oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) acetyl-CoA, reduced form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), carbon dioxide. activity PDC up- down-regulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, respectively. addition, pyruvate key intermediate glucose oxidation important precursor synthesis glucose, glycerol, fatty acids, nonessential amino acids.
