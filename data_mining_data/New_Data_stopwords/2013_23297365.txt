 Hereditary motor sensory disorders peripheral nerve form one common groups human genetic diseases collectively called Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy. Using linkage analysis three generation kindred, mapped new locus X-linked dominant CMT chromosome Xp22.11. microsatellite scan X chromosome established significant linkage several markers including DXS993 (Zmax = 3.16; theta = 0.05). Extended haplotype analysis refined linkage region 1.43-Mb interval flanked markers DXS7110 DXS8027. Whole exome sequencing identified missense mutation c.G473A (p.R158H) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 3 (PDK3) gene. change localized within 1.43-Mb linkage interval, segregated affected phenotype excluded ethnically matched control chromosomes. PDK3 one four isoenzymes regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), reversible phosphorylation, nuclear-coded protein located mitochondrial matrix. PDC catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate acetyl CoA key enzyme linking glycolysis energy-producing Krebs cycle lipogenic pathways. found R158H mutation confers enzyme hyperactivity binds stronger affinity wild-type inner-lipoyl (L2) domain E2p chain PDC. findings suggest reduced pyruvate flux due R158H mutant PDK3-mediated hyper-phosphorylation PDC underlying pathogenic cause peripheral neuropathy. results highlight important causative link peripheral nerve degeneration essential bioenergetic biosynthetic pathway required maintenance peripheral nerves.
