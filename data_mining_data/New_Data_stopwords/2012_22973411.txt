 new concept keeping primary tumor control situ suppress distant foci sheds light treatment metastatic tumor. Hyperthermia considered one means controlling tumor growth. simulate tumor growth, continuum mathematical model introduced. newest understanding Warburg effect cellular metabolism diffusion nutrients tissue taken consideration. numerical results compared vivo experimental data fitting tumor cell doubling time/tumor cell growth rate different thermal conditions. tumor growth curve corresponding average glucose concentration predicted. numerical results quantitatively illustrated controlling effect tumor growth hyperthermia condition initial stage.
