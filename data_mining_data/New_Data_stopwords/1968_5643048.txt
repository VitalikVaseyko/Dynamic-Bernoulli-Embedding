 levels Krebs cycle, glyoxylate cycle, certain enzymes measured wild-type strain seven groups acetate-nonutilizing (acu) mutants Neurospora crassa, growth medium containing sucrose subsequent 6-hr incubation similar medium, containing acetate sole source carbon. wild strain, incubation acetate medium caused rise levels isocitrate lyase, malate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, acetyl-coenzyme synthetase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, fumarate hydratase. Isocitrate lyase activity absent acu-3 mutants; acu-5 mutants lacked acetyl-coenzyme synthetase activity; oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (or low levels) could detected acu-2 acu-7 mutants. acu-6 mutants, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity either low absent. specific biochemical deficiencies could attributed acu-1 acu-4 mutations. role several enzymes growth acetate discussed.
