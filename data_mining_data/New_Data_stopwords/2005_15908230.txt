 Proliferating cells tumor cells particular express pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK). Within tumor metabolome M2-PK regulates proportions glucose carbons channelled synthetic processes (inactive dimeric form) used glycolytic energy production (highly active tetrameric form, component glycolytic enzyme complex). tumor cells, dimeric form M2-PK (Tumor M2-PK) always predominant. dimerization caused direct interaction M2-PK certain oncoproteins. switch tetrameric dimeric form M2-PK allows tumor cells survive environments varying oxygen und nutrient supply.
