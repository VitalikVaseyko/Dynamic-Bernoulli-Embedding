 effect pH presence FBP interaction skeletal muscle (PK-M1) kidney tumor meningioma (PK-M2) pyruvate kinase phospholipids liposomes investigated ultracentrifugation steady-state kinetics compared results obtained using bovine heart (PK-M1) isoenzyme previously studied. Pyruvate kinase specific activity increases upon interaction liposomes. activation specifically sensitive presence phosphatidylserine (PS) liposomes. Liposomes made phosphatidylcholine + phosphatidylserine mixture good adsorptive systems human bovine M-type isozymes low ionic strength. Interaction PK-M1 PS liposomes results change Vmax K(m) values PEP without marked effect Hill coefficients. Addition PS liposomes PK-M2 induces hyperbolic saturation curves PEP.
