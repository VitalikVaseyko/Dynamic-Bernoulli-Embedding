 sensitive method measurement ATP production rate isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria presented. Mitochondrial suspensions prepared differential centrifugation approximately 80 mg soleus muscle. ATP production rates measured luminometrically, utilizing reagent based upon firefly luciferase, emits light proportional ATP concentration. group 10 rats ATP production rates measured following substrate combinations: pyruvate + malate, palmitoyl-L-carnitine + malate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate + rotenone succinate alone. variance method including tissue preparation, protein determination luminometric determination ATP production estimated 10-14% various substrates. Compared values literature, present results show good agreement substrates pyruvate + malate palmitoyl-L-carnitine + malate, lower rates obtained study alpha-ketoglutarate succinate + rotenone. advantage luminometric method high sensitivity. 30-40 mg tissue required complete determination, compared 1-2 g similar assay oxygen consumption. method intended use human subjects facilitate studies mitochondrial respiration patients different age groups healthy subjects.
