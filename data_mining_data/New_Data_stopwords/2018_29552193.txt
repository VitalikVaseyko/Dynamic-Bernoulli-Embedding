 Although hexokinase (HK) 2, pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isozyme 2 lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) predict efficacy medicines various solid tumors, ability predict efficacy cetuximab metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains unclear. mCRC patients pathological specimens received cetuximab chemotherapy 2005 2015 present institution enrolled. Immunohistochemistry used detect HK2, PKM2 LDHA expression. SPSS20 used statistical analysis. total 68 patients included; 33 received cetuximab plus chemotherapy first-line therapy, rest, second- later-line therapy. HK2 expression levels increased cancer compared normal tissue (75.4% vs. 40%; P<0.001), however PKM2 (P=0.243) LDHA (P=0.067) expression levels not. progression-free survival (PFS) first-line cetuximab plus chemotherapy, patients high HK2 expression exhibited longer PFS compared low HK2 expression (23.9 months vs. 6.9 months; P=0.021). However, positive association absent 35 cases administered first-line chemotherapy alone (13.4 months vs. 13.5 months; P=0.539). LDHA expression associated PFS patients receiving first-line chemotherapy (18.3 10.1 months high low expression, respectively; P=0.005), whereas association absent cetuximab plus chemotherapy cases (19.9 months vs. 12 months; P=0.522). Furthermore, high LDHA expression correlated high overall response rate (ORR) (72.2% vs. 15.4%, P=0.006) chemotherapy, however disease control rate (DCR) (P=0.074). Neither DCR ORR associated HK2 expression. PKM2 expression affect PFS, DCR ORR. LDHA expression (P=0.005), pathological differentiation (P=0.019) synchronous/metachronous metastasis (P=0.014) independent predictive factors PFS first-line patients, tumor differentiation (P=0.002) associated overall survival (OS) multivariate analysis. HK2, PKM2 LDHA impact OS. concluded HK2 expression increased colorectal cancer tissue may predict cetuximab efficacy LDHA chemotherapy treatment mCRC.
