 Recirculating, retrograde heart perfusion according Langendorff method used attempt elucidate cardiotoxicity methyl-2-tetradecylglycidate (McNeil 3716, MTG) eccentric hypertrophy elicited compound. subchronic experiments female rats exposed MTG 2 x 10 mg/kg 2 x 25 mg/kg per day 4 weeks. various times hearts perfused ex vivo 2 hr either 5 mmolar glucose 0.5 mmolar palmitate substrate. Substrate uptake (glucose palmitate) enzyme release (LDH-lactic dehydrogenase CPK-creatine-phosphate kinase) assessed perfusion. Biochemical analysis (ATP, ADP, AMP, c-AMP, CP, creatine, pyruvate, lactate, glucose-6-phosphate, glycogen, phospholipids, triglycerides non-esterified fatty acids) done hearts (drug effect) perfusion (stress perfusion). Besides changes energy metabolism high-energy phosphate production, observed previous experiments (Bachmann et al. 1984) massive changes seen energy reserves heart tissue (ATP, CP, glycogen, phospholipids triglycerides). expected, MTG led significant increases also non-esterified fatty acids content hearts.
