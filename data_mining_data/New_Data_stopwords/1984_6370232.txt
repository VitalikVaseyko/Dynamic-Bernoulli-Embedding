 kinetics pyruvate kinase Saccharomyces cerevisiae studied assays pH 6.2 relationships initial velocities catalysed reaction concentrations substrates ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate Mg2+ non-hyperbolic. findings represented empirically exponential model regulatory enzyme. analysis shows ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate Mg2+ display positive homotropic interaction binding behaviour (calculated) Hill slopes half-saturation equal 1.06, 2.35 3.11 respectively [Ainsworth (1977) J. Theor. Biol. 68, 391-413]. direct heterotropic interaction ADP phosphoenolpyruvate small negative, overall interaction substrates becomes positive positive interactions Mg2+ taken account. heterotropic interactions substrates, though smaller magnitude, comparable revealed rabbit muscle enzyme [Ainsworth, Kinderlerer & Gregory (1983) Biochem. J. 209, 401-411], suggested common origin charge interactions within active site.
