 1. Cytosolic mitochondrial ATP ADP concentrations liver cells isolated normal fed, starved diabetic rats determined. 2. cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio 6,9 10 normal fed, starved diabetic rats respectively. 3. mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio 2 normal diabetic rats 1.6 starved rats. 4. Adenosine increased cytosolic lowered mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio, whereas atractyloside opposite effect. 5. Incubation hepatocytes fructose, glycerol sorbitol led fall ATP/ADP ratio cytosolic mitochondrial compartment. 6. interrelationship mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio phosphorylation state pyruvate dehydrogenase intact cells studied. 7. hepatocytes isolated fed rats inverse correlation mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio active form pyruvate dehydrogenase (pyruvate dehydrogenase a) demonstrable loading fructose, glycerol sorbitol. 8. correlation obtained pyruvate dihydroxyacetone. pyruvate, explained inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. 9. Liver cells isolated fed animals displayed pyruvate dehydrogenase activity twice found vivo. Physiological values obtained hepatocytes incubated albumin-oleate, also yielded highest mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio.
