 Promising new hallmarks cancer alteration energy metabolism involves molecular mechanisms shifting cancer cells aerobe glycolysis. goal evaluate correlation mutation commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene TP53 metabolism. established database comprising mutation RNA-seq expression data TCGA repository performed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis compare expression gene TP53 mutated wild type samples. together 762 breast cancer samples evaluated 215 TP53 mutation. Top up-regulated metabolic genes include glycolytic enzymes (e.g. HK3, GPI, GAPDH, PGK1, ENO1), glycolysis regulator (PDK1) pentose phosphate pathway enzymes (PGD, TKT, RPIA). Gluconeogenesis enzymes (G6PC3, FBP1) down-regulated. Oxygen consumption extracellular acidification rates measured TP53 wild type mutant breast cell lines microfluorimetric analyzer. Applying metabolic inhibitors presence absence D-glucose L-glutamine cell culture experiments resulted higher glycolytic mitochondrial activity TP53 mutant breast cancer cell lines. summary, TP53 mutation influences energy metabolism multiple levels. results provide evidence synergistic activation multiple hallmarks linking mutation status key driver gene.
