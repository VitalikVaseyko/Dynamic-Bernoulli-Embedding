 PURPOSE: Cultured retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may become therapeutic option transplantation retinal disease. However maintaining native RPE phenotype vitro proven challenging. human RPE cell-line ARPE-19 used widely alternative primary RPE. grown DMEM/F12 medium standard, phenotype dependent culture conditions, many differentiation markers usually absent. purpose study examine sensitive phenotype ARPE-19 modulated growth media without metabolite pyruvate elucidate better RPE growth conditions. METHODS: ARPE-19 cells passages p22 p28 cultured filters 3 months DMEM/F12 DMEM media without pyruvate 1% fetal calf serum. Assessment differentiation performed using pigmentation, immunocytochemistry, protein/mRNA expression, transepithelial resistance, VEGF secretion, ultrastructure. RESULTS: Pyruvate, combination DMEM, induced dark pigmentation promoted differentiation markers CRALBP MerTK. Importantly, RPE65 protein detected Western blotting enhanced pyruvate, high glucose, DMEM. ARPE-19 cells maintained medium could also phagocytose human photoreceptor outer segments (POS). VEGF secretion greater DMEM cultures affected glucose pyruvate. Pigmentation never occurred DMEM/F12. CONCLUSIONS: study demonstrated important differentiation markers, including pigmentation Western blots RPE65 protein, showed human POS phagocytosis ARPE-19 cultures using simple differentiation protocol. results favor use high-glucose DMEM pyruvate future RPE differentiation studies.
