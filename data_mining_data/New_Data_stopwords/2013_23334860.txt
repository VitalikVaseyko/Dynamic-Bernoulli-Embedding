 RATIONALE: Closure ductus arteriosus (DA) essential transition fetal neonatal patterns circulation. Initial PO2-dependent vasoconstriction causes functional DA closure within minutes. Within days fibrogenic, proliferative mechanism causes anatomic closure. Though modulated endothelial-derived vasodilators constrictors, O2 sensing intrinsic ductal smooth muscle cells oxygen-induced DA constriction persists absence endothelium, endothelin, cyclooxygenase mediators. O2 increases mitochondrial-derived H2O2, constricts ductal smooth muscle cells raising intracellular calcium activating rho kinase. However, mechanism oxygen changes mitochondrial function unknown. OBJECTIVE: purpose study determine whether mitochondrial fission crucial O2-induced DA constriction closure. METHODS RESULTS: Using DA harvested 30 term infants correction congenital heart disease, well DA term rabbits, demonstrate mitochondrial fission crucial O2-induced constriction closure. O2 rapidly (<5 minutes) causes mitochondrial fission cyclin-dependent kinase- mediated phosphorylation dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) serine 616. Fission triggers metabolic shift ductal smooth muscle cells activates pyruvate dehydrogenase increases mitochondrial H2O2 production. Subsequently, fission increases complex activity. Mitochondrial-targeted catalase overexpression eliminates PO2-induced increases mitochondrial-derived H2O2 cytosolic calcium. small molecule Drp1 inhibitor, Mdivi-1, siDRP1 yield concordant results, inhibiting O2-induced constriction (without altering response phenylephrine KCl) preventing O2-induced increases oxidative metabolism, cytosolic calcium, ductal smooth muscle cells proliferation. Prolonged Drp1 inhibition reduces DA closure tissue culture model. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial fission obligatory, early step mammalian O2 sensing offers promising target modulating DA patency.
