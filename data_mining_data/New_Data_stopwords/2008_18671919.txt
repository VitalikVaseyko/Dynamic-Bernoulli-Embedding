 Boar spermatozoa contain isoforms glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12) pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40). sperm-specific forms, GAPDH-S PK-S, tightly bound cell structures. immunofluorescence microscopy GAPDH-S PK-S localised principal piece boar sperm flagellum well acrosomal region sperm head head-midpiece junction. midpiece flagellum, however, contains isoforms GAPDH PK recognised antibodies somatic GAPDH PK, respectively, antibodies GAPDH-S PK-S. sections boar testis, GAPDH-S PK-S first detected elongating spermatids developing flagellum head labelled antibodies GAPDH-S PK-S. contrast, antibodies rabbit muscle GAPDH PK labelled developmental stages germ cells also neighbouring contractile cells. Thus, structure-bound sperm-specific enzymes, GAPDH-S PK-S, appeared late spermatogenesis simultaneously development structures bound.
