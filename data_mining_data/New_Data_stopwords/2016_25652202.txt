 BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) common malignant primary brain tumor. contrast tumor types, aberrant glucose metabolism important component GBM growth chemoresistance. Recent studies human orthotopic GBM mice situ demonstrated GBM cells rely glycolysis mitochondrial oxidation glucose catabolism. observations suggest homeostasis energy metabolism GBM cells might disturbed dual-inhibition glucose metabolism. present study aimed evaluate efficacy mechanisms dual-targeting therapy GBM cells. METHODS: Representative GBM cells (immortalized GBM cell lines patient-derived GBM cells) non-cancerous cells treated 4-(N-(S-penicillaminylacetyl)amino) phenylarsonous acid (PENAO), in-house designed novel arsenic-based mitochondrial toxin, combination dichloroacetate (DCA), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor. efficacy combinatorial therapy evaluated MTS assay, clonogenic surviving assay apoptotic assays. underlying mechanisms dual-targeting treatment unraveled using mitochondrial membrane potential measurements, cytosol/mitochondrial ROS detection, western blotting, extracellular flux assay mass spectrometry. RESULTS: monotherapies, PENAO DCA induced proliferation arrest panel GBM cell lines primary isolates. PENAO inhibited oxygen consumption, induced oxidative stress depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, turn activated mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. combining DCA PENAO, two drugs worked synergistically inhibit cell proliferation (but significant effect non-cancerous cells), impair clonogenicity, induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. oxidative stress mitochondrial origin takes prominent place mechanism combination PENAO DCA induces cell death. Additionally, PENAO-induced oxidative damage enhanced DCA glycolytic inhibition turn diminished acid production induced PENAO. Moreover, DCA treatment also led alteration multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype GBM cells, thereby leading increased cytosolic accumulation PENAO. CONCLUSIONS: findings study shed new light respect dual-targeting glucose metabolism GBM cells innovative combination PENAO DCA shows promise expanding GBM therapies.
