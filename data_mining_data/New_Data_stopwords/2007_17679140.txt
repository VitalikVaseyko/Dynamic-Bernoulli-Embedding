 present study, investigated Cl(-) regulates proliferation MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. proliferation MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells diminished lowering extracellular Cl(-) concentration ([Cl(-)](o)) culture medium. lowered [Cl(-)](o) increased periods G(0)/G(1) G(2)/M phases cell cycle. studied effects [Cl(-)](o) key enzymes, Rb cdc2, playing key roles checking points G(0)/G(1) G(2)/M phases cell cycle. lowered [Cl(-)](o) diminished active forms enzymes, Rb cdc2. found action lowered [Cl(-)](o) cell proliferation, cell cycle, Rb cdc2 abolished presence 2mM glutamine, pyruvate another Krebs cycle substrate. Taken together, observations indicate first time Cl(-) modulates Rb cdc2, enhancing proliferation MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells.
