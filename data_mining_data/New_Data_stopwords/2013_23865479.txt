 Four enzymes gluconeogenic pathway Sulfolobus solfataricus purified kinetically characterized. enzymes reconstituted vitro quantify contribution temperature instability pathway intermediates carbon loss system. reconstituted system, consisting phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase/phosphatase, maintained constant consumption rate 3-phosphoglycerate production fructose 6-phosphate 1-h period. Cofactors ATP NADPH regenerated via pyruvate kinase glucose dehydrogenase. mathematical model constructed basis kinetics purified enzymes measured half-life times pathway intermediates. model quantitatively predicted system fluxes metabolite concentrations. Relative enzyme concentrations chosen half carbon system lost due degradation thermolabile intermediates dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, indicating intermediate instability high temperature significantly affect pathway efficiency.
