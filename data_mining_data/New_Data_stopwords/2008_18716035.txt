 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) plays important role regulating carbohydrate metabolism skeletal muscle. PDH activated PDH phosphatase (PDP) deactivated PDH kinase (PDK). Obesity large negative impact skeletal muscle carbohydrate metabolism, whereas endurance training shown improve regulatory control skeletal muscle carbohydrate metabolism, coupled obesity. majority literature focused PDK, little information available PDP. determine relative role PDP regulating skeletal muscle PDH activity obesity endurance training, obese lean Zucker rats remained sedentary endurance trained (1 h/day, 5 days/wk) period 8 wk. Soleus, red gastrocnemius, (RG), white gastrocnemius (WG) muscles sampled training period. main findings 1) obesity resulted 46% decrease PDP activity expressed per milligram extracted mitochondrial protein RG, PDP isoform content unchanged; 2) 8 wk endurance training led significant 1.4-2.2-fold increase PDP activity muscle examined obese rats, concomitant increase PDP1 protein seen soleus RG; 3) 8 wk endurance training led trending 1.4-2.2-fold increase PDP activity muscle examined obese rats, concomitant increase PDP1 protein seen soleus RG; 4) PDP2 protein content affected obesity training. results suggest decreased PDP activity oxidative skeletal muscles may play role impairment carbohydrate metabolism obese rats, reversible endurance training.
