 binding sites fibrinogen Factor XIII localized using immunoblotting technique. Platelet Factor XIII bound fibrinogen plasmin degradation products fibrin(ogen) including Fragments: X, D1-D3, D-dimer, bind Fragment E. Binding Platelet Factor XIII independent calcium ions could inhibited presence 0.5 NaCl. Binding could also inhibited preincubating Factor XIII 100-fold molar excess fibrinogen 100-fold molar excess Fragment E. Binding Factor XIII fibrinogen specific, since several proteins tested (ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, beta-galactosidase, fructose kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, fumarase pyruvate kinase) bind Factor XIII. Furthermore, binding observed either Factor XIII left antiFactor XIII antiserum substituted nonimmune serum. fibrinogen reduced prior electrophoresis, Factor XIII bound alpha B beta chains fibrinogen des A,B fibrinogen, B beta-chain Fragment X, gamma-chains. Localization Factor XIII binding sites carboxy terminal segments alpha B beta chains Fragment D-domain fibrinogen could important physiological consequences.
