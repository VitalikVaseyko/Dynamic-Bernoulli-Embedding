 BACKGROUND: Metformin biguanide, belonging oral hypoglycemic agents widely used treatment type 2 diabetes. Evidence indicate Metformin inhibits cell proliferation several human cancers inhibits Warburg phenomenon tumor cells. RESULTS: Low PDH levels observed OSCC, Metformin promotes increase PDH levels hypoxic conditions. Metformin also reduced HIF-1alpha mRNA protein levels. Metformin demonstrated antiproliferative effects, inhibited migration, increased number apoptotic cells increased transcription caspase 3. OBJECTIVE: present study aims explore effects Metformin hypoxic conditions. Specifically, focused pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), (hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha) HIF-1alpha levels oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell phenotype. Additionally, also investigated theoretical consequence Metformin treatment. METHODS: PDH levels patients OSCC oral dysplasia evaluated. Metformin administered vitro test effect Metformin hypoxic conditions. results complemented Bioinformatics analyses. CONCLUSIONS: conclusion, current findings show Metformin reduces HIF-1alpha gene expression increases PDH expression. Metformin inhibits cell proliferation migration OSCC cell line model. Additionally, Metformin enhances number apoptotic cells caspase 3 levels. Interestingly enough, Metformin increase mutant p53 levels hypoxic conditions.
