 renal injury, selective damage occurs proximal tubules result inhibition glycolysis. molecular mechanism damage known. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation plays critical role proximal tubular cell death several renal disorders. Here, studied role PARP glycolytic flux pig kidney proximal tubule epithelial LLC-PK1 cells using XFp extracellular flux analysis. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation PARP activation increased approximately 2-fold incubation cells 10 mM glucose 30 minutes, treatment PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) does-dependently prevented glucose-induced PARP activation (approximately 14.4% decrease 0.1 mM 3-AB-treated group 36.7% decrease 1 mM 3-AB-treated group). Treatment 1 mM 3-AB significantly enhanced glucose-mediated increase extracellular acidification rate (61.1+/-4.3 mpH/min vs. 126.8+/-6.2 mpH/min approximately 2-fold) compared treatment vehicle, indicating PARP inhibition increases glycolytic activity glycolytic flux including basal glycolysis, glycolytic activity, glycolytic capacity kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells. Glucose increased activities glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase LLC-PK1 cells. Furthermore, PARP inhibition selectively augmented activities hexokinase (approximately 1.4-fold vehicle group), phosphofructokinase-1 (approximately 1.6-fold vehicle group), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (approximately 2.2-fold vehicle group). conclusion, data suggest PARP activation may regulate glycolytic activity via poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells.
