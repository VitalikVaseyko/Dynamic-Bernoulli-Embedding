 Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) brain mitochondrial matrix enzyme. PDH impairment stroke particularly devastating given PDH's critical role link anaerobic aerobic metabolism. study evaluates restoration oxidative metabolism energy regulation therapeutic combination normobaric oxygen (NBO) plus either therapeutic hypothermia (TH) ethanol. Sprague-Dawley rats subjected middle cerebral artery occlusion autologous embolus. One hour occlusion, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) administered alone NBO (60%), EtOH (1.0 g/kg), TH (33 degrees C), either singly combination. Neurological deficit score infarct volume assessed 24 hr t-PA-induced reperfusion. PDH activity reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels measured 3 24 hr t-PA. Western blotting used detect PDH pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) protein expression. t-PA ischemic rats, NBO combined TH EtOH effectively decreased infarct volume neurological deficit. combined therapies produced greater increases PDH activity protein expression well greater decreases PDK expression. Compared monotherapeutic approaches, combined therapies provided significant declines ROS generation. Reperfusion t-PA followed 60% NBO improves efficacy EtOH TH neuroprotection ameliorating oxidative injury improving PDH regulation. Comparable neuroprotective effects found treating either EtOH TH, suggesting similar mechanism neuroprotection possibility substituting EtOH TH clinical settings. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
