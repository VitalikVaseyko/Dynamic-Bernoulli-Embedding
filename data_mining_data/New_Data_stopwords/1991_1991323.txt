 Point mutagenesis nuclear targeting sequence nucleoplasmin identified two interdependent basic domains. separated 10 intervening "spacer" amino acids tolerate point mutations insertions. Amino acids basic domains required nuclear targeting, transport defect mutation one domain amplified simultaneous mutation other. Therefore, basic domains interdependent. strikingly similar motif two clusters basic residues seen nuclear targeting sequence Xenopus N1. also conserved related nucleolar protein NO38. Several short sequences known necessary nuclear targeting fall within similar motif.
