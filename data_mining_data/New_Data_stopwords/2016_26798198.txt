 study investigated effect jicama extract hyperglycemia insulin sensitivity animal model type 2 diabetes. Male C57BL/Ksj-db/db mice divided groups subsequently fed regular diet (controls), diet supplemented jicama extract, rosiglitazone. 6 weeks, blood levels glucose glycosylated hemoglobin significantly lower animals administered jicama extract control group. Additionally, glucose insulin tolerance tests showed jicama extract increased insulin sensitivity. homeostatic index insulin resistance lower jicama extract-treated group diabetic control group. Administration jicama extract significantly enhanced expressions phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase Akt substrate 160 kDa, plasma membrane glucose transporter type 4 skeletal muscle. Jicama extract administration also decreased expressions glucose 6-phosphatase phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase liver. Jicama extract may increases insulin sensitivity inhibites gluconeogenesis liver.
