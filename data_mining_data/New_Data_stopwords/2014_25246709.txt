 Cancer stem cells (CSC) may take advantage Warburg effect-induced siphoning metabolic intermediates de novo fatty acid biosynthesis increase self-renewal growth. examined anti-CSC effects antifungal polyketide soraphen A, specific inhibitor first committed step lipid biosynthesis catalyzed acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA). mammosphere formation capability MCF-7 cells reduced following treatment soraphen dose-dependent manner. MCF-7 cells engineered overexpress oncogene HER2 (MCF-7/HER2 cells) 5-fold sensitive MCF-7 parental cells soraphen A-induced reductions mammosphere-forming efficiency. Soraphen treatment notably decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSC-like cells impeded HER2's ability increase ALDH+-stem cell population. following results confirmed soraphen A-induced suppression CSC populations occurred throughACACA-driven lipogenesis: a.) exogenous supplementation supraphysiological concentrations oleic acid fully rescued mammosphere formation presence soraphen b.) mammosphere cultures MCF-7 cells stably silenced expression cytosolic isoform ACACA1, specifically participates de novo lipogenesis, mostly refractory soraphen treatment. findings reveal first time ACACA may constitute previously unrecognized target novel anti-breast CSC therapies.
