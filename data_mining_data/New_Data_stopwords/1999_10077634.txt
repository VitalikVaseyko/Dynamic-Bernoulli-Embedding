 Cancer cells maintain high glycolytic rate even presence oxygen, phenomenon first described 70 years ago known historically Warburg effect. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate powerful allosteric regulator glycolysis acts stimulate activity 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), important control point mammalian glycolysis. steady state concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate turn depends activity enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase, expressed several tissue-specific isoforms. report herein identification gene product enzyme induced proinflammatory stimuli distinguished presence multiple copies AUUUA mRNA instability motif 3'-untranslated end. inducible gene PFK-2 expressed constitutively several human cancer cell lines found required tumor cell growth vitro vivo. Inhibition inducible PFK-2 protein expression decreased intracellular level 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, product pentose phosphate pathway important precursor nucleic acid biosynthesis. studies identify regulatory isoenzyme may essential tumor growth provide explanation long-standing observations concerning apparent coupling enhanced glycolysis cell proliferation.
