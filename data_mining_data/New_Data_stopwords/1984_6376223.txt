 Cultured human fibroblasts represent appropriate model studying insulin receptor interaction hormone responsiveness. investigated properties pyruvate dehydrogenase multi-enzyme complex (PDC) studied effects various concentrations porcine biosynthetic human insulin (BHI) activity enzyme. optimal conditions assay, BHI porcine insulin activated PDC dose-dependent fashion full activation enzyme achieved 10(-8) insulin. half-maximal concentration porcine human insulin similar, occurring level 5 X 10(-9) activation PDC human fibroblasts. conclude PDC cultured human fibroblasts activated human porcine insulin comparable physiologic concentration. Human fibroblasts may therefore serve useful model study insulin action isolated human tissue.
