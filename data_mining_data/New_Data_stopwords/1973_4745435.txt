 pathways glucose pyruvate metabolism Spirochaeta litoralis, free-living, strictly anaerobic marine spirochete, studied. Addition 0.2 0.4 NaCl (final concentration) suspending buffers prevented cell lysis necessary gas evolution various substrates cell suspensions. organism fermented glucose mainly ethanol, acetate, CO(2), H(2). Determination radioactivity products formed (14)C-labeled glucose assays enzymatic activities cell extracts indicated S. litoralis catabolized glucose via Embden-Meyerhof pathway. clostridial-type clastic reaction utilized spirochete degrade pyruvate acetyl-coenzyme A, CO(2), H(2). Formation acetate acetyl-coenzyme catalyzed phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent acetaldehyde alcohol dehydrogenases converted acetyl-coenzyme ethanol. reversible hydrogenase activity detected cell extracts. S. litoralis cell extracts contained rubredoxin similar spectral properties bacterial rubredoxins.
