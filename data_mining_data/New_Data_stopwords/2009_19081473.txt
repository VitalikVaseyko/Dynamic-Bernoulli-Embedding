 BACKGROUND: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) bioactive sphingolipid released activated platelets stimulates migration vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) vitro. S-1-P activate akt, regulate multiple cellular functions including cell migration. Akt activation downstream phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-K) phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). objective study examine regulation akt signaling smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration response S-1-P. METHODS: Murine arterial SMC cultured vitro. Linear wound microchemotaxis assays migration Boyden chambers performed presence S-1-P without akt inhibitor (aktI). Assays performed PI3-K, PDK1, akt, GSK3beta presence various inhibitors transfection G beta gamma inhibitor beta ARK(CT). RESULTS: S-1-P induced time-dependent PI3-K, PDK1, akt activation. migratory responses assays S-1-P blocked aktI. Activation akt dephosphorylation downstream kinase, GSK3 beta, inhibited aktI. Inhibition PI3-K LY294002 significantly decreased activation PI3-K akt. Inhibition G beta gamma inhibited akt activation decrease activation PI3-K PDK1. Although inhibition ras manumycin effect, inhibition rho C3 limited activation PI3K akt. PDK1 responses unchanged inhibition GTPases. Inhibiting generation reactive oxygen species N-acetylcysteine epidermal growth factor receptor AG1478 inhibited PDK1 activation response S-1-P. CONCLUSION: S-1-P-mediated migration akt-dependent. S-1-P-mediated akt phosphorylation controlled G beta gamma-dependent PI3-K activation, requires GTPase rho G beta gamma. PDK1 activation requires G beta gamma-dependent generation reactive oxygen species epidermal growth factor receptor activation.
