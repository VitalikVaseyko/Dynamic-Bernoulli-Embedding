 BACKGROUND: lack continuous vitro culture system blood stages malarial parasites unique tropism reticulocytes, Plasmodium vivax Plasmodium yoelii 17X reticulocyte-prone strain, hinders research organisms. maturation reticulocytes erythrocytes complex process involving selective removal membrane proteins transferrin receptor, CD71. order advance characterization infected cells experimental infections BALB/c mice P. yoelii 17X, CD71 expression erythroid cells (TER119+) assessed vitro culture P. yoelii 17X attempted adding reticulocytes highly expressing CD71. METHODS: BALB/c mice infected P. yoelii 17X-GFP transgenic parasites erythroid cells (TER119+) analysed blood, spleen bone marrow cells. TER119, CD71 GFP expression assessed different points post-infection flow cytometry. Moreover, vitro culture P. yoelli 17X attempted adding red blood cells (RBCs) mice pyruvate kinase deficiency, contain high percentages CD71hi cells peripheral blood compared healthy animals. RESULTS: predominance erythroid cells lacking expression CD71 (CD71-) observed peripheral blood spleen normal infected animals ten days post-infection (pi). ten days pi, however, dramatic temporal switch erythroid cells highly expressing CD71 (CD71hi) observed spleen day 15 pi peripheral blood infected cells. distribution erythroid cells expressing differently CD71 noticed bone marrow. Yet, similar peripheral blood spleen, predominance CD71hi cells observed 15 days pi. Remarkably, CD71hi cells cells predominantly infected organs well peripheral blood. Attempts thus made culture vitro P. yoelli 17X strain adding RBCs pyruvate kinase-deficient mice containing high percentages CD71hi cells peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: parasite preference immature cells rare normal peripheral blood could important implications development vitro culture system P. vivax.
