 review basics cancer metabolism focuses exploiting metabolic differences normal cancer cells. first part review covers different metabolic pathways utilized normal cells generate cellular energy, ATP, glycolytic intermediates required build cellular machinery. second part review discusses aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, metabolic reprogramming involving glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutaminolysis context developing targeted inhibitors cancer cells. Finally, selective targeting cancer mitochondrial metabolism using positively charged lipophilic compounds potential therapeutics ability mitigate toxic side effects conventional chemotherapeutics normal cells discussed. hope graphical review useful helping undergraduate, graduate, medical students understand investigating basics cancer cell metabolism could provide new insight developing potentially new anticancer treatment strategies.
