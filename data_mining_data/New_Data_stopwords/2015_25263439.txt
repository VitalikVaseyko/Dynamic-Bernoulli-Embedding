 Tripartite motif-containing protein 35 (TRIM35) member RBCC family, highly conserved order consisting RING domain followed one two B-Box domains coiled-coil domain. previously identified TRIM35 novel tumor suppressor human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, molecular mechanism TRIM35 uses suppress tumorigenicity largely unknown. Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) demonstrated central role metabolic reprogramming cancer progression. Phosphorylation PKM2 tyrosine residue 105 (Y105) regulates PKM2 provide metabolic advantage tumor cells, thereby promoting tumor growth. present work, mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated interaction TRIM35 PKM2. Co-IP experiments confirmed TRIM35 interacts PKM2 coiled-coil domain required interaction. Furthermore, coiled-coil domain mediates decreases Warburg effect cell proliferation HCC cells. addition, TRIM35 suppresses tumorigenicity HCC cells blockade PKM2 Y105 phosphorylation. Collectively, data reveal new function TRIM35, regulate Warburg effect tumorigenicity interaction PKM2 HCC.
