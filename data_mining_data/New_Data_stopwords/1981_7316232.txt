 basis performed tests, observed change pattern pyruvate kinase isoenzyme malignant testicular tumor (only isoenzyme K) isoenzyme tissue testis tumorously changed. control group pyruvate kinase isoenzyme K observed. Similarly, another pattern aldolase isoenzymes tumorous tissue stated (AC) comparing control group (arrangement AC, BC). changes referred also activity examined enzymes tumorous tissue tissue testis tumorously changed. authors suggest existence factor depressor characteristics, produced neoplasm changes function genes responsible synthesis examined isoenzymes tissue tumorously changed.
