 Craviten effect platelets suspended plasma investigated two methods incubation drug: fresh platelets incubated 18 h 4 degrees C Craviten added plasma platelets stored 18 h 4 degrees C without Craviten incubated Craviten 37 degrees C 1 h. evaluation metabolic activity function platelets, levels high-energy compounds ATP ADP, activity hexokinase pyruvate kinase amount adenyl nucleotides released platelets thrombin addition measured, spontaneous aggregation platelets c-AMP determined. experiments demonstrated Craviten prevented fall ATP level stored platelets, raised activity hexokinase pyruvate kinase platelets, increased amount nucleotides released platelets release reaction. Craviten inhibited also increased spontaneous aggregation stored platelets raised c-AMP level.
