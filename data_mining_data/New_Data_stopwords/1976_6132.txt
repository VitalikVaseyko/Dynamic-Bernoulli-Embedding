 Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) isolated Neurospora crassa mycelium grown 28 degrees C (PK-28) 42 degrees C (PK-42). regulatory properties, particularly response towards allosteric effector fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), different two enzymes. PK-28 showed activation FDP PK-42, comparable conditions, appeared activated low concentrations FDP inhibited higher ones. PK-28, complex formation FDP results lowering isoelectric point 6.40 5.50, representing pI unliganded enzyme complex, respectively. contrast this, PK-42 exhibits weak binding FDP suggested lack decrease isoelectric point treatment comparable concentrations FDP. Studies quenching aromatic residue fluorescence PK-28 PK-42, following binding FDP, indicate although ligand binds types enzymes affinity two vastly different. Dissociation constants 9.3 muM 0.1 mM calculated binding FDP PK-28 PK-42, respectively. concluded growth elevated temperatures induced conformational change pyruvate kinase leading partial desensitization allosteric site. nature factor(s) responsible change understood present.
