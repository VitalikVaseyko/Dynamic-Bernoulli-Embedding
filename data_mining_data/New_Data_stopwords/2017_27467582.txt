 Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients harbor germ line mutations TP53 gene increased risk hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. Recently, elevated levels aromatase, rate-limiting enzyme estrogen biosynthesis, found breast tissue LFS patients. Although p53 down-regulates aromatase expression, underlying mechanisms incompletely understood. present study, found LFS stromal cells expressed higher levels Hsp90 ATPase activity aromatase compared wild-type stromal cells. Inhibition Hsp90 ATPase suppressed aromatase expression. Silencing Aha1 (activator Hsp90 ATPase 1), co-chaperone Hsp90 required ATPase activity, led inhibition Hsp90 ATPase activity reduced aromatase expression. comparison wild-type stromal cells, increased levels Hsp90 client proteins, HIF-1alpha, PKM2 found LFS stromal cells. complex comprised HIF-1alpha PKM2 recruited aromatase promoter II LFS stromal cells. Silencing either HIF-1alpha PKM2 suppressed aromatase expression LFS stromal cells. CP-31398, p53 rescue compound, suppressed levels Aha1, Hsp90 ATPase activity, levels PKM2 HIF-1alpha, aromatase expression LFS stromal cells. Consistent vitro findings, levels Hsp90 ATPase activity, Aha1, HIF-1alpha, PKM2, aromatase increased mammary glands p53 null versus wild-type mice. PKM2 HIF-1alpha shown co-localize nucleus stromal cells LFS breast tissue. Taken together, results show Aha1-Hsp90-PKM2/HIF-1alpha axis mediates induction aromatase LFS.
