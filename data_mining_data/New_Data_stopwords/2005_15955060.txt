 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex occupies central strategic position muscle intermediary metabolism primarily regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. identification multiple isoforms pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1-4) pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP1-2) raised intriguing new possibilities chronic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex control. Experiments date suggest PDK4 major isoenzyme responsible changes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity response various different metabolic conditions. Using cultured human skeletal muscle cell model system, found expression PDK2 PDK4 mRNA upregulated response glucose deprivation fatty acid supplementation, effects reversed insulin treatment. addition, insulin directly downregulates PDK2 PDK4 mRNA transcript abundance via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway, may involve glycogen synthase kinase-3 utilize mammalian target rapamycin mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways. order elucidate regulation PDK, role peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPAR) investigated using highly potent subtype selective agonists. PPARalpha PPARdelta agonists found specifically upregulate PDK4 mRNA expression, whereas PPARgamma activation selectively decreased PDK2 mRNA transcript abundance. PDP1 mRNA expression unaffected conditions analysed. results suggest human muscle, hormonal nutritional conditions may control PDK2 PDK4 mRNA expression via common signalling mechanism. addition, PPARs appear independently regulate specific PDK isoform transcipt levels, likely impart important metabolic mediation fuel utilization muscle.
