 1. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown limiting K(+) concentration growth inhibited O(2) concentrations 40%. conditions cells grow large unable maintain ionic gradients washed water. 2. Cells grown excess K(+) showed pattern change cell size change O(2) concentration, magnitude changes much less. Cells grown excess K(+) leaky. 3. Cell death, growth development ;leakiness' correlated cells grown limiting K(+) concentration. 4. activities alcohol dehydrogenase cytochrome oxidase higher K(+)-deficient cells cells grown excess K(+). differences much larger measurements made cellular basis made protein basis. 5. 100% O(2) 3mm-K(+) medium sufficient produce normal yeast cells.
