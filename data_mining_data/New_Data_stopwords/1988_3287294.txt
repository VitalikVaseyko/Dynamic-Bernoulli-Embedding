 Whereas great number mutations located coding regions genes described, genetic defects involving regulatory elements (cis-) diffusible effectors controlling gene expression (trans-) poorly known. Moreover, appears structural defects transcribed regions genes already delivered "conceptual" message, whereas studies consequences one single gene defect expression genes vivo functions available. present communication, wish address following issue: take advantage Nature's experiments, ie. diseases, extend knowledge coordinate regulation gene expression, via original pathway, ie. pathophysiological pathway? select inborn acquired metabolic diseases models could provide insight yet unknown factors involved trans- regulation gene expression?
