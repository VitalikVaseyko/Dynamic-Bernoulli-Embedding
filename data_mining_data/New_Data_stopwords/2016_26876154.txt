 cancer cells, mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) requires hormonal nutrient signals activation, constitutively activated. found overexpression pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activates mTORC1 signaling phosphorylating mTORC1 inhibitor AKT1 substrate 1 (AKT1S1). unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomic survey identified 974 PKM2 substrates, including serine202 serine203 (S202/203) AKT1S1, proteome renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Phosphorylation S202/203 AKT1S1 PKM2 released AKT1S1 raptor facilitated binding 14-3-3, resulted hormonal- nutrient-signals independent activation mTORC1 signaling led accelerated oncogenic growth autophagy inhibition cancer cells. Decreasing S202/203 phosphorylation TEPP-46 treatment reversed effects. RCCs breast cancers, PKM2 overexpression correlated elevated S202/203 phosphorylation, activated mTORC1 inhibited autophagy. results provided first phosphorylome PKM2 revealed constitutive mTORC1 activating mechanism cancer cells.
