 Two novel procedures used regulate, vivo, formation phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) glycolysis Streptococcus lactis ML3. first procedure, glucose metabolism specifically inhibited p-chloromercuribenzoate. Autoradiographic enzymatic analyses showed cells contained glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, triose phosphates. Dithiothreitol reversed p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibition, intermediates rapidly quantitatively transformed 3- 2-phosphoglycerates plus PEP. three intermediates metabolized constituted intracellular PEP potential. second procedure simply involved starvation organisms. starved cells devoid glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose- 1,6-diphosphate, triose phosphates contained high levels 3- 2-phosphoglycerates PEP (ca. 40 mM total). capacity regulate PEP formation vivo permitted characterization glucose lactose phosphotransferase systems physiologically intact cells. Evidence obtained "feed forward" activation pyruvate kinase vivo phosphorylated intermediates formed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction glycolytic sequence. data suggest pyruvate kinase (an allosteric enzyme) plays key role regulation glycolysis phosphotransferase system functions S. lactis ML3.
