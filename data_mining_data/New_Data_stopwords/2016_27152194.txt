 BACKGROUND: Gleason scores (GS) 3+3 3+4 prostate cancers (PCa) differ greatly clinical courses, Gleason pattern (GP) 4 representing major independent risk factor cancer progression. However, Gleason grade reliably ascertained diagnostic biopsy, largely due sampling inadequacies, subjectivity Gleason grading procedure, lack objective biomarker assays stratify prostate cancer aggressiveness. aggressive cancer types, tumor microenvironment exhibits reciprocal pro-tumorigenic metabolic phenotype consistent reverse Warburg effect (RWE). RWE viewed physiologic response epithelial phenotype independent epithelial genotype direct tumor sampling. hypothesize differential expression RWE-associated genes used classify Gleason pattern, distinguishing GP3 GP4 PCa foci. METHODS: Gene expression profiling conducted RNA extracted laser-capture microdissected stromal tissue surrounding 20 GP3 21 GP4 cancer foci PCa patients GS 3+3 GS >/=4+3, respectively. Genes probed using 102-gene NanoString probe set targeted towards biological processes associated RWE. Differentially expressed genes identified normalized data univariate analysis. top-scoring pair (TSP) analysis completed raw gene expression values. Genes analyzed enriched Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes protein-protein interactions using STRING GeneMANIA. RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified nine genes (FOXO1 (AUC: 0.884), GPD2, SPARC, HK2, COL1A2, ALDOA, MCT4, NRF2, ATG5) differentially expressed GP3 GP4 stroma (p<0.05). However, following correction false discovery, FOXO1 retained statistical significance q<0.05. TSP analysis identified significant gene pair, namely ATG5/GLUT1. Greater expression ATG5 relative GLUT1 correctly classified 77.4 % GP3/GP4 samples. Enrichment GO-biological processes revealed catabolic glucose processes oxidative stress response pathways strongly associated GP3 foci GP4. FOXO1 identified primary nodal protein. CONCLUSIONS: report RWE-associated genes used distinguish GP3 GP4 prostate cancers. Moreover, find RWE response downregulated stroma surrounding GP4, possibly via modulation FOXO1.
