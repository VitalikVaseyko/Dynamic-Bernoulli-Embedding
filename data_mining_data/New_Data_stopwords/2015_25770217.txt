 Physiological processes rely regulation total mRNA levels cell. diploid organisms, transcriptional activation one alleles gene may involve trans-allelic interactions provide tight spatial temporal level gene expression regulation. mechanisms underlying interactions still remain poorly understood. Here, demonstrate lipopolysaccharide stimulation murine macrophages rapidly resulted actin-mediated transient homologous spatial proximity Tnfalpha alleles, necessary mono- biallelic switch gene expression. identified two new complementary long noncoding RNAs transcribed TNFalpha locus showed knockdown opposite effects Tnfalpha spatial proximity allelic expression. Moreover, observed spatial proximity Tnfalpha alleles depended pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) T-helper-inducing POZ-Kruppel-like factor (ThPOK). study suggests role lncRNAs regulation somatic homologous spatial proximity allelic expression control necessary fine-tuning mammalian immune responses.
