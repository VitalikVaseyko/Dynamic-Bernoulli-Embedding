 CstA (the peptide transporter carbon starvation CstA family; TC# 2.A.114) family peptide transporters belongs second largest superfamily secondary transporters, amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) superfamily. representative CstA family previously characterized either biochemically structurally, identified function one members, transport protein YjiY Escherichia coli Expression yjiY gene regulated LytS-like histidine kinase BtsS, sensor extracellular pyruvate, together LytTR-like response regulator BtsR. YjiY consists 716 amino acids, form 18 putative transmembrane helices. Transport studies intact cells provided evidence YjiY specific high-affinity transporter pyruvate (Km 16 muM). Furthermore, reconstitution purified YjiY proteoliposomes revealed YjiY pyruvate/H(+) symporter. long assumed E. coli possesses transporter(s) pyruvate, present study first definitively identify protein. Based function, propose rename uncharacterized gene yjiY btsT (for "Brenztraubensaure" transporter, German word pyruvate).IMPORTANCE BtsT (formerly known YjiY) found many commensal pathogenic representatives Enterobacteriaceae study first time characterizes pyruvate transporter Escherichia coli, BtsT, specific pyruvate/H(+) symporter. nutrients limiting, BtsT takes pyruvate medium, thus enabling used carbon source growth survival E. coli.
