 regulation gene expression two important glycolytic enzymes, glucokinase L-type pyruvate kinase, hormones carbohydrates studied, primary cultures adult rat hepatocytes. Insulin caused time- dose-dependent increases amounts mRNAs two enzymes hepatocytes, although glucokinase responded hormone faster L-type pyruvate kinase. induction glucokinase mRNA insulin require presence glucose itself, L-type isozyme dependent glucose concentration. effect, fructose glycerol could partially substitute glucose, pyruvate 2-deoxyglucose, nonmetabolizable glucose analog, could not. time course insulin induction presence fructose, glycerol, similar presence glucose. presence glycerol, mRNA increased diphasic manner: first increase, probably reflected effects fructose glycerol normal liver, reached maximum 3 h, whereas second increase corresponded increase presence glucose. results suggested metabolite glucose required insulin-induced increase L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA. Cycloheximide inhibited effects insulin two mRNAs, suggesting ongoing protein synthesis required cases. addition 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, inhibitor protein kinase C, also inhibited effects insulin. However, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate alone induce two mRNAs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
