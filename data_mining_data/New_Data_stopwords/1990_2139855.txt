 previous article [(1987) J. Theor. Biol, 127, 439-449], dynamic behavior simple substrate cycle, bounded moiety conservation, one two antagonist enzymes subjected destabilizing factor, investigated. Depending upon control parameter chosen, is, total interconverted substrate concentration ratio interconverting enzyme maximal activities, monostability, reversible (hysteresis) and/or irreversible transitions could observed. present work, report experiments dealing moiety ATP/ADP interconverted enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK). cycle operates conditions (1) PFK inhibited excess substrate, ATP, (2) enzymes working zero-order kinetics respective cosubstrates F6P PEP. conditions PK maximal activity lower PFK optimal activity, irreversible transitions high ATP (resp. low ADP) steady-state concentration lower (resp. higher) one, observed varying total moiety (ATP + ADP) concentration. graphical interpretation observed behavior given. Plausible biochemical consequences phenomenon also emphasized.
