 Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) calcium channels modulating important calcium-mediated processes. Recent studies implicate IP(3)R cell metabolism, specific evidence missing regarding IP(3)R's effects actual metabolic pathways key energy metabolites. Here, applied metabolomics molecular biology compare DT40 cell lines devoid IP(3)R (KO) wild-type (WT) counterpart. NMR LC-MS metabolomic data showed KO cell line different basic energy metabolism WT cell line, showing enhanced Warburg effect. particular, KO cells exhibited significant perturbation energy charge, reduced glutathione NADPH ratios slower cellular growth rate. Subsequent flow cytometry results showed KO cell line higher level general reactive oxygen species (ROS) lower level peroxynitrites. ROS disturbance could explained observing lower expression superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) unchanged expression catalase. higher ROS seems involved slower growth rate KO cells, ROS scavenger increasing growth rate. However, KO WT cell lines show noticeable differences AMPK phosphorylated AMPK levels, suggesting possible saturation AMPK-mediated metabolic regulatory circuit cells. Overall, study reveals IP3R's roles ROS homeostasis metabolic pathways well effects KO cellular phenotypes.
