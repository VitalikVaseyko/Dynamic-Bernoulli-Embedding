 batch continuous Bacillus subtilis cultures provided small amount citrate, acid production ceases, carbon yield increases 2-fold, productivity recombinant protein increases. hypothesized pyruvate kinase activity attenuated, turn lowers glucose flux minimizes acid overflow prompted low Krebs cycle capacity. complement existing enzyme activity, linear programming, metabolite pool studies, (13)C NMR studies performed. Atom mapping isotopomer mapping matrix methods used select best glucose label. "Best" defined NMR spectra glutamate associated metabolizing labeled glucose via different candidate metabolic trafficking scenarios would differ considerably fine structure (e.g., relative singlet intensities). experiments performed 1-(13)C glucose, observed NMR spectra corresponded well one predicted arise metabolic trafficking occurs according pyruvate kinase attenuation scenario. evidence fortifies prospects successfully basing metabolic engineering strategy reducing pyruvate kinase activity better match glycolytic Krebs cycle capacities.
