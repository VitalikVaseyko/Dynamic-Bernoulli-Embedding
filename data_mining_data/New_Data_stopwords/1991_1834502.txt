 Measurements made levels metabolic intermediates activities enzymes glycolytic route, pentose phosphate pathway, polyol pathway livers kidneys NOD mice. 34% decrease UDP-glucose, 40% decrease glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) fructose-6-phosphate, 75% decrease fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P) found livers NOD mice. fall level F2,6P (the important regulator glycolysis) accompanied 20% reduction activity phosphofructokinase. changes agreement previously reported liver depletion glycogen reduced synthesis proteins nucleic acids diabetic state. kidney, increase hexokinase activity consistent increased levels G6P glycogen content kidney diabetes. decreased level phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate reported regulator kidney growth initial period diabetes still found NOD mice 6 wk development hyperglycemia. reported changes similar seen alloxan- streptozocin-induced diabetic animals, certain changes marked NOD mice, especially directed increase nucleic acid protein synthesis diabetic kidney.
