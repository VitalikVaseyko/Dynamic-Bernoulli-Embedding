 AIMS: regimens neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) squamous cervical cancer (SCC) frequently use cisplatin combined paclitaxel. Unfortunately, cervical cancers show resistance principal chemotherapeutic agents treatment, decreasing effectiveness therapy. objective study search predictive markers response NAC patients SCC. MAIN METHODS: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) accompanied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) used analyze identify differentially expressed proteins ten cases advanced cervical cancer patients receiving cisplatin-based NAC. patients received two cycles NAC. Cell proliferation rate cisplatin resistant human cervical cancer cell Hela/DDP parent cell Hela treatment Hsp70 inhibitor and/or cisplatin tested MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Twelve protein spots changed abundance, quantitative comparison spot volumes showed seven protein spots up-regulated five spots down-regulated NAC non-responders compared NAC responders. proteins involved various cellular processes essential cell metabolism, migration apoptotic signal transduction. high-fold changes proteins stathmin1, Hsp70 pyruvate kinase isoform M2 validated Western blot analysis. Over-expression Hsp70 inhibits efficacy cisplatin. Hsp70 inhibitor enhanced sensitivity cisplatin Hela Hela/DDP cells. SIGNIFICANCE: study found many candidate proteins involved chemotherapy resistance/sensitivity, among Hsp70 might potential biomarkers predict efficacy chemotherapy SCC patients.
