 PDK1 phosphorylates multiple substrates including Akt PIP3-dependent mechanisms. report provide evidence prostate cancer cells stimulated activated alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M*) PDK1 phosphorylates Akt T-loop Thr(308) using Raptor mTORC1 complex scaffold protein. First demonstrate PDK1, Raptor, mTOR co-immunoprecipitate. Silencing expression, PDK1, also Raptor RNAi nearly abolished Akt phosphorylation Akt(Thr308) Raptor-immunoprecipitates alpha2M*-stimulated prostate cancer cells. Immunodepleting Raptor PDK cell lysates cells treated alpha2M* drastically reduced Akt phosphorylation Thr(308), recovered adding supernatant Raptor- PDK1-depleted cell lysates, respectively. Studies insulin binding receptor prostate cancer cells yielded similar results. thus demonstrate phosphorylating T-loop Akt residue Thr(308) PDK1 requires Raptor mTORC1 complex platform scaffold protein.
