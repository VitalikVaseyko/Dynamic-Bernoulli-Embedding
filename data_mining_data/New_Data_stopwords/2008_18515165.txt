 influence myofibrillar creatine kinase myosin-ATPase activity examined cardiac ventricular myofibrils isolated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) freshwater turtle (Trachemys scripta). ATPase rate assessed recording rephosphorylation ADP pyruvate kinase reaction alone together amount creatine formed, myofibrillar bound creatine kinase activated phosphocreatine. steady-state concentration ADP solution varied activity pyruvate kinase added solution. rainbow trout myofibrils high pyruvate kinase activity, creatine kinase competed ADP influence total ATPase activity. ADP concentration elevated within physiological range lowering pyruvate kinase activity, creatine kinase competed efficiently increased ATPase activity twice trout turtle. examined trout myofibrils, ATPase activity reduced four times inhibiting activity myofibril-bound creatine kinase iodoacetamide reduction partially counteracted, creatine kinase activity restored adding creatine kinase solution. Hence, results suggest myofibril-bound creatine kinase needed fully activate myosin-ATPase activity hearts ectothermic vertebrates despite low energy turn-over relative endothermic species.
