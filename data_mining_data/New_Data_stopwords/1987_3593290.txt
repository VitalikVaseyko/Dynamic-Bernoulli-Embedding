 Factors influencing increase glucose consumption erythrocytes mechanical stress studied. shear stress 2000-5000 s-1 glucose consumption goes 20-50%. effect disappears protein-free media, Ca2+-free media resealed red ghosts; cases certain morphological deviations observed stressed cells. results confirm vital role energy-consuming contractile apparatus erythrocyte membrane restoration smooth biconcave shape deformation.
