 combined system measuring glutathione stability, hexose monophosphate pathway activity, glutathione synthesis, glucose consumption lactate formation erythrocytes devised. method results obtained blood samples six glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies, one glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency two pyruvate kinase deficiencies. results indicate one abnormal enzyme may exert influence several enzyme systems valuable investigate metabolism erythrocytes using system different erythroenzymopathies well different variants one enzyme deficiency.
