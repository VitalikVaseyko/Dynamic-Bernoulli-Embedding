 Fibrates hypolipidemic pharmaceuticals detected contaminants wastewaters surface waters. work, possible effects two fibrates, Bezafibrate (BEZA) Gemfibrozil (GEM) bivalve mollusc Mytilus spp investigated. immune cells, hemocytes, addition compounds vitro induced rapid lysosomal membrane destabilization, extracellular lysozyme release, production decreased phagocytic activity. effect fibrates partly mediated activation ERK p38 MAPKs (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases), demonstrated use specific inhibitors different kinases. effects fibrates hemocyte function confirmed vivo, hemocytes mussels injected 0.01, 0.1 1 nmol/animal (corresponding nominal concentrations 3.61, 36.18 361.8ng/g dry weight BEZA 2.50, 25.03 250.35 ng/g dry weight GEM, respectively) sampled 24h post-injection. compounds induced concentration-dependent lysosomal destabilization extracellular lysozyme release; increase phagocytosis observed highest concentration. vivo exposure fibrates also induced significant effects mussel digestive gland, key metabolic organ bivalves. BEZA GEM increased activity glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK), Glutathione transferase (GST) glutathione reductase (GSR), total glutathione content. significant increase peroxisomal enzyme catalase observed; however, BEZA exposure decreased Palmytoyl CoA oxidase activity, whereas GEM ineffective. results indicate mussels environmental concentrations hypolipidemic drugs affect immune function, well glycolysis, redox balance peroxisomal function.
