 PURPOSE: One hallmarks cancer cells excessive conversion glucose lactate normoxic conditions, also known Warburg effect. Here, tested whether targeted inhibition EGFR may revert effect reactivate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sensitive (HCC827) resistant (H1975 H1993) NSCLC cells treated panel EGFR MET inhibitors, tested changes EGFR signaling, glycolytic cascade, mitochondrial function. Silencing key glycolytic enzymes performed targeted siRNAs. Furthermore, tumor-bearing nude mice treated EGFR inhibitors evaluated (18)F-FDG PET/CT tumors analyzed glycolytic mitochondrial proteins. RESULTS: Effective inhibition EGFR signaling NSCLC cells induced dramatic reduction hexokinase II (HKII) phospho-pyruvate kinase M2 (p-PKM2, Tyr105) levels well upregulation mitochondrial complexes subunits (OXPHOS). Accordingly, decreased lactate secretion increased intracellular ATP levels also observed response EGFR inhibitors. Downregulation HKII PKM2 targeted siRNA transfection cause upregulation OXPHOS enhanced effects EGFR TKIs. Conversely, selective inhibition AKT ERK1/2 caused OXPHOS upregulation glycolysis inhibition, respectively. Similar findings obtained tumors animals treated appropriate EGFR inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: findings indicate EGFR inhibitors may reactivate oxidative phosphorylation cancer cells provide mechanistic clue rational combination agents targeting EGFR-dependent proliferation glucose metabolism cancer therapy.
