 effects aldosterone vasopressin Cl- transport investigated mouse cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) cell line derived transgenic mouse carrying SV40 large antigen driven proximal regulatory sequences L-pyruvate kinase gene. cells features tight epithelium expressed amiloride-sensitive sodium channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genes. dD-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) caused rapid, dose-dependent, increase short-circuit current (Isc). Experiments ion channel blockers apical ion substitution showed current represented amiloride-sensitive Na+ 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate-sensitive glibenclamide-sensitive Cl- fluxes. Aldosterone (5 x 10(-7)M 3 24 hr) stimulated Isc apical-to-basal 22Na+ flux 3-fold. 36Cl- flux studies showed dDAVP aldosterone stimulated net Cl- reabsorption dDAVP potentiated action aldosterone Cl- transport. Whereas aldosterone affected apical-to-basal 36Cl- flux, dDAVP mainly increased apical-to-basal Cl- flux basal-to-apical flux Cl- lesser extent. results suggest discrete dDAVP-elicited Cl- secretion involves CFTR dDAVP aldosterone may affect different ways observed increased Cl- reabsorption model mouse cultured cortical collecting duct cells.
