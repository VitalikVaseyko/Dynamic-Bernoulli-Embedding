 fetus requires significant energy growth development. Although glucose major source energy fetus, maternal nutrients also appear promote growth. Thus, goal studies determine whether triglyceride-rich remnants taken placenta whether maternal dietary lipids, independently adiposity, impact fetal growth. accomplish first goal, chylomicron particles duallly labeled cholesteryl ester triglycerides. placenta took remnant particles/core lipids rates greater adipose tissue skeletal muscle less liver. Although placenta expresses apoE receptors, uptake chylomicron remnants and/or core lipids occur independently apoE. determine impact dietary lipid fetal growth, independent maternal adiposity, females fed high-fat diets (HFD) 1 mo; change adiposity leptin levels prior pregnancy dams fed HFD. Fetal masses greater dams fed HFD, mRNA levels proteins involved fatty acid oxidation (CPT I, PPARalpha), glucose oxidation (pyruvate kinase) regulatory processes (HNF-4alpha, LXR), increased maternal dietary fat. also change mRNA levels proteins involved placental glucose fatty acid transport, GLUT1 protein levels microvillous membranes similar placentas dams fed either diet. Thus, ability placenta take chylomicron remnant core lipids likely contributes accelerated fetal growth females fed high fat diets.
