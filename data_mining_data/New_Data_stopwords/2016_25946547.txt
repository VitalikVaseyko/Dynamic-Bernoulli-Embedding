 PURPOSE: MRS hyperpolarized [2-(13)C]pyruvate used assess multiple metabolic pathways within mitochondria (13)C label lost conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA. study presents first MR spectroscopic imaging hyperpolarized [2-(13)C]pyruvate glioma-bearing brain. METHODS: Spiral chemical shift imaging spectrally undersampling scheme (1042 Hz) hard-pulse excitation exploited simultaneously image [2-(13)C]pyruvate, [2-(13)C]lactate, [5-(13)C]glutamate, metabolites known produced brain injection hyperpolarized [2-(13)C]pyruvate, without chemical shift displacement artifacts. separate undersampling scheme (890 Hz) also used image [1-(13)C]acetyl-carnitine. Healthy C6 glioma-implanted rat brains imaged baseline dichloroacetate administration, drug modulates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity. RESULTS: baseline metabolite maps showed higher lactate lower glutamate tumor compared normal-appearing brain. Dichloroacetate led increase glutamate tumor normal-appearing brain. Dichloroacetate-induced %-decrease lactate/glutamate comparable lactate/bicarbonate decrease hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate studies. Acetyl-carnitine observed muscle/fat tissue surrounding brain. CONCLUSION: Robust volumetric imaging hyperpolarized [2-(13)C]pyruvate downstream products performed glioma-bearing rat brains, demonstrating changes mitochondrial metabolism dichloroacetate.
