 Livers mice lacking carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) compared wild type (WT) mice determine effect transcription factor hepatic energy metabolism. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex considerably active ChREBP(-/-) mice diminished pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity. Greater pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity caused stimulation lactate pyruvate oxidation, significantly impaired fatty acid oxidation perfused livers ChREBP(-/-) mice. shift mitochondrial substrate utilization led 3-fold reduction free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio, 1.7-fold increase free mitochondrial [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio, 2-fold decrease free cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP][P(i)] ratio ChREBP(-/-) liver compared control. Hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux impaired ChREBP deletion secondary decreased fatty acid oxidation, increased pyruvate oxidation, limited pyruvate availability reduced activity liver pyruvate kinase malic enzyme, replenish pyruvate via glycolysis pyruvate cycling. Overall, shift fat utilization pyruvate lactate utilization resulted decrease energy ATP hydrolysis hypo-energetic state livers ChREBP(-/-) mice.
