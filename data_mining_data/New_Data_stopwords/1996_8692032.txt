 Chronic stress humans cause psychological physiological reactions. Emotional withdrawal may accompanied biochemical changes cell turns anaerobic metabolism instead aerobic respiratory metabolism. aquatic defence mechanisms whales, well humans, use part diving reflex escape stress. cell metabolizes anaerobically presence adequate oxygen (the Warburg effect, present virtually cancer cells). oxygen toxic causes DNA damage. ATPase enzyme, normally useful phosphorylation sugar, reverts former function part SOS 'error-prone' DNA repair system attempts repair damaged DNA sending new DNA causes mutations chromosomes cell acts like anaerobic microbe, reproducing immortally eventually metastasizing. Chronic stress lessened treatment cancer.
