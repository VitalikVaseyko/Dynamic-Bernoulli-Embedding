 Among phenylbutazone (PZ) related compounds, suxibuzone (SUX) caused extensive decrease pyruvate kinase (PK) activity lower toxicity. Therefore, studied effect SUX rat hepatocarcinogenesis confirm assumption agent causes prolonged decrease PK activity rat liver promotes hepatocarcinogenesis. initiation rats fed diet containing 0.06% 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB) 4 weeks. end 53 weeks experiment incidences liver tumors 14.3 70.0% rats fed basal diet rats fed 0.5% SUX diet, respectively, initiation. tumors observed rats fed SUX diet without initiation. result shows SUX promotes hepatocarcinogenesis supports assumption.
