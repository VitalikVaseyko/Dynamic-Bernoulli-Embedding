 1. Pyruvate kinase partially purified foot, mantle, digestive gland active aestivating snails. 2. pH 7.0 apparent Km values phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 0.064 mmol/l enzyme foot 0.071 mmol/l enzyme mantle; ADP 0.35 mmol/l foot enzyme 0.33 mmol/l mantle enzyme. 3. enzymes inhibited alanine, could reversed fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), although FBP alone weak activator. 4. Decreasing pH 6.5 markedly increased inhibition alanine reduced response FBP. 5. enzymes tissues aestivating snails showed small decrease affinity PEP small increase effectiveness alanine inhibitor. 6. changes indicative down-regulation enzyme consistent observations species metabolic depression. 7. contrast enzyme digestive gland active animals showed sigmoidal saturation kinetics PEP S0.5 1.2 mmol/l, markedly higher affinity PEP, S0.5 = 0.20 mmol/l aestivation. may indicative metabolic changes occurring digestive gland.
