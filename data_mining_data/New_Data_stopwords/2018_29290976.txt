 shown neurons alter expression astrocytic metabolic enzymes secretion unknown molecule(s) extracellular fluid. Here, present evidence neuron-derived transthyretin (TTR) stimulates expression glycolytic enzymes astrocytes reflected increased synthesis ATP. action TTR restricted regulatory enzymes glycolysis: phosphofructokinase P (PFKP) pyruvate kinase M1/M2 isoforms (PKM1/2). regulation PFK PKM expression TTR presumably specific brain tissue independent role TTR carrier protein thyroxine retinol. TTR induced expression PKM PFK mediated cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway antagonized PI3K/Akt pathway. results provide first experimental evidence action TTR neuron-derived energy metabolism activator astrocytes describe mechanisms action. data presented suggest TTR involved mechanism neurons stimulate degradation glycogen-derived glucosyl units without significant modulation glucose uptake glial cells.
