 Thioltransferase, enzyme catalyzes thiol/disulfide exchange reaction presence GSH, purified homogeneity 15% SDS-PAGE human (36,000-fold purification) bovine (23,000-fold) erythrocyte hemolysates. enzymes similar properties monomeric structures (M(r) = 11,000) broad specificities substrates ranging low-molecular disulfides (S-sulfocysteine, cystamine, cystine) protein disulfides (trypsin insulin). highly sensitive SH-reagents (monoiodoacetic acid mercuric chloride), protected inactivation presence disulfides (GSSG, cystamine, cystine). Phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase inactivated disulfides reactivated effectively addition thioltransferase GSH. addition, disulfides membrane proteins human erythrocytes oxidatively damaged diamide treatment reduced SH-free form effectively incubation thioltransferase.
