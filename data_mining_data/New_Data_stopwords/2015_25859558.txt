 BACKGROUND: Many cancers adopt metabolism characterized well-known Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis). Recently, numerous attempts made treat cancer targeting one gene products involved pathway without notable success. work outlines transcriptomic approach identify genes highly perturbed clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). METHODS: developed model extended Warburg effect outlined model using Cytoscape. Following this, gene expression fold changes (FCs) tumor adjacent normal tissue patients CCRCC (GSE6344) mapped network. Gene expression values FCs greater two considered potential targets treatment CCRCC. RESULTS: Cytoscape network includes glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), TCA cycle, serine/glycine pathway, partial glutaminolysis fatty acid synthesis pathways. Gene expression FCs nine 10 CCRCC patients GSE6344 data set consistent shift aerobic glycolysis. Genes involved glycolysis synthesis transport lactate over-expressed, gene codes kinase inhibits conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA. Interestingly, genes code unique proteins involved gluconeogenesis strongly under-expressed also case serine/glycine pathway. latter two results suggest role attributed M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), frequently principal isoform PK present cancer: i.e. causing buildup glucose metabolites shunted branch pathways synthesis key biomolecules, may operative CCRCC. fact increase expression FC gene PPP consistent hypothesis. Literature protein data generally support transcriptomic findings. CONCLUSIONS: number key genes identified could serve valid targets anti-cancer pharmaceutical agents. Genes highly over-expressed include ENO2, HK2, PFKP, SLC2A3, PDK1, SLC16A1. Genes highly under-expressed include ALDOB, PKLR, PFKFB2, G6PC, PCK1, FBP1, PC, SUCLG1.
