 Cancer progression depends cell-intrinsic processes interactions different cell types. However, large-scale assessment cell type composition molecular profiles individual cell types within tumors remains challenging. address this, developed epigenomic deconvolution (EDec), silico method infers cell type composition complex tissues well DNA methylation gene transcription profiles constituent cell types. applying EDec Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast tumors, detect changes immune cell infiltration related patient prognosis, striking change stromal fibroblast-to-adipocyte ratio across breast cancer subtypes. Furthermore, show less adipose stroma tends display lower levels mitochondrial activity associated cancerous cells higher levels oxidative metabolism. findings highlight role stromal composition metabolic coupling distinct cell types within tumors.
