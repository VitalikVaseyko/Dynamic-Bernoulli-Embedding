 AIM: evaluate performance fecal tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (M2PK) diagnostic biomarker colorectal cancer (CRC) screening high-risk symptomatic populations. METHODS: consecutive patients (N=328) referred elective colonoscopy prospectively enrolled. One walnut-sized stool sample collected patient analysis tumor M2PK content using ELISA kit. dietary restrictions applied. clinical pathologists conducted M2PK analyses blinded patients' confirmed diagnoses. Levels fecal tumor M2PK compared histopathological results colorectal biopsies. RESULTS: 328 patients underwent colonoscopy examinations, 197 (60.1%) men 131 (39.9%) women. Based histopathological examination, 83 (25.3%) patients normal bowel histology, 42 (12.8%) patients CRC, 67 (20.4%) patients adenoma, 19 (5.8%) patients inflammatory bowel disease, three (0.9%) patients amoebic colitis, 114 (34.8%) patients infective colitis. cutoff level tumor M2PK concentration defined 4.00 U/mL. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value M2PK test 71.4%, 71.0%, 73.5%, 94.4%, respectively. significant association CRC fecal tumor M2PK level (P<0.001). M2PK test detected 16 tumors among 67 (23.9%) cases adenoma, eight tumors among 19 (42.1%) cases inflammatory bowel disease, 35 tumors among 114 (30.7%) cases infective colitis, two tumors among three (66.7%) cases amoebic colitis. CONCLUSION: fecal tumor M2PK test good sensitivity specificity CRC detection, especially high-risk symptomatic populations.
