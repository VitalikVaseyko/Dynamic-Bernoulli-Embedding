 Muscle weakness myopathy observed vitamin deficiency chronic renal failure, concentrations active vitamin D3 metabolite, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3), low. evaluate mechanism action 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 skeletal muscle, examined mitochondrial oxygen consumption, dynamics, biogenesis changes expression nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins human skeletal muscle cells following treatment 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) increased 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated cells. Vitamin D3 metabolites lacking 1alpha-hydroxyl group (vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) decreased failed increase OCR. 1alpha-Hydroxyvitamin D3 increase OCR. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated cells, mitochondrial volume branching expression pro-fusion protein OPA1 (optic atrophy 1) increased, whereas expression pro-fission proteins Fis1 (fission 1) Drp1 (dynamin 1-like) decreased. Phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) (Ser-293) PDH kinase 4 (PDK4) decreased 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated cells. trend increased PDH activity 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-treated cells (p = 0.09). 83 nuclear mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins changed following 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 treatment; notably, PDK4 mRNA decreased, PDP2 mRNA increased. MYC, MAPK13, EPAS1 mRNAs, encode proteins regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, increased following 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Vitamin receptor-dependent changes expression 1947 mRNAs encoding proteins involved muscle contraction, focal adhesion, integrin, JAK/STAT, MAPK, growth factor, p53 signaling pathways observed following 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Five micro-RNAs induced repressed 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 regulates mitochondrial function, dynamics, enzyme function, likely influence muscle strength.
