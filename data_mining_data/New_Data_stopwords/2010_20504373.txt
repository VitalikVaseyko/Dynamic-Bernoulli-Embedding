 BACKGROUND: Appropriate long-term drinking red wine associated reduced risk cardiovascular disease. Resveratrol, well-known SIRT1 activator considered one beneficial components contained red wine, also developed drug candidate. previously demonstrated resveratrol protects brain ischemic stroke mice PPARalpha-dependent mechanism. report different effects oligomers resveratrol. METHODS: evaluated activation PPARs epsilon-viniferin, resveratrol dimer, vaticanol C, resveratrol tetramer, cell-based reporter assays using bovine arterial endothelial cells, well activation SIRT1. Moreover, tested metabolic action administering vaticanol C high fat diet wild-type PPARalpha-knockout male mice eight weeks. RESULTS: show vaticanol C activates PPARalpha PPARbeta/delta cell-based reporter assays, activate SIRT1. epsilon-Viniferin shows similar radical scavenging activity resveratrol, neither effects PPARs SIRT-1. Eight-week intake vaticanol C high fat diet upregulates hepatic expression PPARalpha-responsive genes cyp4a10, cyp4a14 FABP1, skeletal muscle expression PPARbeta/delta-responsive genes, UCP3 PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoform 4), wild-type, PPARalpha-knockout mice. CONCLUSION: Vaticanol C, resveratrol tetramer, activated PPARalpha PPARbeta/delta vitro vivo. findings indicate activation PPARalpha PPARbeta/delta vaticanol C may novel mechanism, affording beneficial effects lifestyle-related diseases.
