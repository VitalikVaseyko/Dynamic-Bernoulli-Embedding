 Cancer cells may survive oxygen nutrient deprivation metabolic reprogramming high levels anaerobic glycolysis, contributes tumor growth drug resistance. Abnormally expressed glucose transporters (GLUTs) colocalized hypoxia (Hx) inducible factor (HIF)1alpha peri-necrotic regions human colorectal carcinoma. However, underlying mechanisms anti-necrotic resistance conferred glucose metabolism hypoxic cancer cells remain poorly understood. aim investigate signaling pathways Hx-induced necroptosis explore role glucose pyruvate metabolite mechanisms death resistance. Human colorectal carcinoma cells Hx exposed without glucose, cell necroptosis examined receptor-interacting protein (RIP)1/3 kinase immunoprecipitation (32)P kinase assays. results showed increased RIP1/3 complex formation phosphorylation hypoxic, normoxic cells glucose-free media. Blocking RIP1 signaling, necrostatin-1 gene silencing, decreased lactodehydrogenase (LDH) leakage plasma membrane disintegration. Generation mitochondrial superoxide noted hypoxic challenge; reduction antioxidants inhibited RIP signaling cell necrosis. Supplementation glucose diminished RIP-dependent LDH leakage morphological damage hypoxic cells, whereas non-metabolizable sugar analogs not. Hypoxic cells given glucose showed nuclear translocation HIF1alpha associated upregulation GLUT-1 GLUT-4 expression, well increase intracellular ATP, pyruvate lactate levels. glucose-mediated death resistance ablated iodoacetate (an inhibitor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), UK5099 (an inhibitor mitochondrial pyruvate carrier), suggesting glycolytic pathway involved anti-necrotic mechanism. Lastly, replacing glucose cell-permeable pyruvate derivative also led decrease Hx-induced necroptosis suppression mitochondrial superoxide energy-independent manner. conclusion, glycolytic metabolism confers resistance RIP-dependent necroptosis hypoxic cancer cells partly pyruvate scavenging mitochondrial free radicals.
