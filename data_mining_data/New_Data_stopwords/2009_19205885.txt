 Mitochondrial malfunctioning implicated pathogenesis variety disorders, including cancer multiple neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease. Disturbance mitochondrial vital functions, e.g., production ATP, calcium buffering capacity, generation reactive oxygen species, potentially involved disease pathogenesis. Neurological disorders caused mitochondrial deterioration often associated cell loss within specific brain regions. contrast, mitochondrial alterations tumor cells "Warburg effect" might lead cell survival resistance tumor cells chemotherapy. review devoted role mitochondria neurodegeneration tumor formation, describes targeting mitochondria beneficial therapy diseases, affect large human population.
