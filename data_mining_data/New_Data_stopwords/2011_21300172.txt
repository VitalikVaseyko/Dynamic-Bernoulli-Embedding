 Cancer cells exist pure homogeneous populations vivo. Instead embedded "cancer cell nests" surrounded stromal cells, especially cancer associated fibroblasts. Thus, unreasonable suspect stromal fibroblasts could influence metabolism adjacent cancer cells, visa versa. accordance idea, recently proposed Warburg effect cancer cells may due culturing cancer cells themselves, normal stromal context tumor microenvironment. fact, cancer cells co-cultured fibroblasts, cancer cells increase mitochondrial mass, fibroblasts lose mitochondria. depth analysis phenomenon reveals aggressive cancer cells "parasites" use oxidative stress "weapon" extract nutrients surrounding stromal cells. Oxidative stress fibroblasts induces autophagic destruction mitochondria, mitophagy. Then, stromal cells forced undergo aerobic glycolysis, produce energy-rich nutrients (such lactate ketones) "feed" cancer cells. mechanism would allow cancer cells seed anywhere, without blood vessels food source, could simply induce oxidative stress wherever go, explaining cancer cells survive metastasis. suggest stromal catabolism, via autophagy mitophagy, fuels anabolic growth tumor cells, promoting tumor progression metastasis. previously termed new paradigm "The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model Cancer Metabolism", "Reverse Warburg Effect". also discuss glutamine addiction (glutaminolysis) cancer cells fits well new model, promoting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism aggressive cancer cells.
