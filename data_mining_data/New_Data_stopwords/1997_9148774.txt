 Actinobacillus sp. 130Z fermented glucose major products succinate, acetate, formate. Ethanol formed minor fermentation product. CO2-limiting conditions, less succinate ethanol formed. fermentation product ratio remained constant pH values 6.0 7.4. succinate produced hydrogen present gas phase. Actinobacillus sp. 130Z grew expense fumarate l-malate reduction, hydrogen electron donor. substrates more-reduced carbohydrates (e.g., d-sorbitol) resulted higher succinate and/or ethanol production. Actinobacillus sp. 130Z contained key enzymes involved Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pentose-phosphate pathways contained high levels phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, fumarate reductase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate formate-lyase, phosphotransacetylase, acetate kinase, malic enzyme, oxaloacetate decarboxylase. levels PEP carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase significantly higher Actinobacillus sp. 130Z Escherichia coli K-12 accounted differences succinate production. Key enzymes end product formation Actinobacillus sp. 130Z regulated energy substrates.
