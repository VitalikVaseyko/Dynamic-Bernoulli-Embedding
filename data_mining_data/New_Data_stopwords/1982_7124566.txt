 homozygous beta-thalassemia low serum level alpha-tocopherol found. administration high doses vitamin increased serum level, decreased lipid peroxidation and, case, prolonged red blood cell survival; significant change transfusion requirement obtained. data available vitamin E heterozygous beta-thalassemia. studied 131 patients aged 1 72 years thalassemic trait 218 age-matched controls. Serum level alpha-tocopherol statistically lower former. studied effect vitamin E 10 patients. subject subsequent parameters determined three month treatment (vitamin E 400-600 mg/day) glutathione peroxidase, pyruvate kinase creatine erythrocytes serum vitamin E red blood cell count. Hematological values unchanged patients. half biochemical parameters showed reduction lipid peroxidation increased erythrocyte survival.
