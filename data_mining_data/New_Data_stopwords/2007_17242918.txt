 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Regulation glyceroneogenesis key enzyme cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C) plays major role control fatty acid release adipose tissue. investigate effect rosiglitazone expression genes involved fatty acid metabolism resulting metabolic consequences. MATERIALS METHODS: Rosiglitazone administered Zucker fa/fa rats 4 days 24 diabetic patients 12 weeks, mRNA expression genes encoding PEPCK-C, mitochondrial PEPCK, adipocyte lipid-binding protein, glycerol kinase, lipoprotein lipase glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase examined s.c. adipose tissue real-time RT-PCR. Glyceroneogenesis determined using [1-(14)C]pyruvate incorporation lipids. Cultured adipose tissue explants overweight women undergoing plastic surgery incubated rosiglitazone various times mRNA determination analysis PEPCK-C protein, activity glyceroneogenesis. RESULTS: Rosiglitazone administration rats induced expression gene encoding PEPCK-C mRNA (PCK1) PEPCK-C activity adipose tissue resulting 2.5-fold increase glyceroneogenesis. accompanied improvement dyslipidaemia demonstrated decrease plasma NEFAs triacylglycerol. rosiglitazone-treated diabetic patients, PCK1 mRNA raised 2.5-fold s.c. adipose tissue. Rosiglitazone treatment adipose tissue explants overweight women caused selective augmentation PCK1 mRNA reached maximum 9-fold 14 h, mRNA genes remained unaffected. Experiments inhibitors showed direct transcription-only effect, followed increase PEPCK-C protein, enzyme activity glyceroneogenesis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: results favour adipocyte glyceroneogenesis initial thiazolidinedione-responsive pathway leading improvement dyslipidaemia.
