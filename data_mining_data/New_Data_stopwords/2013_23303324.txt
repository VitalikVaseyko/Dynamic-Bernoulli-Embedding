 assessed hypoxia tolerance 11 species fish superfamily Cottoidea (commonly called sculpins) known differ critical O(2) tensions (P(crit)) examined whether hypoxia tolerance correlated larger substrate stores higher maximal activity enzymes associated anaerobic adenosine triphosphate production (especially glycolysis). Among sculpins studied, large variation time loss equilibrium (LOE(50)) 6.4 +/- 0.1 torr, values ranging 25 538 min, variation LOE(50) correlated P(crit). measures time LOE(50) P(crit) regressed maximal enzyme activities lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), citrate synthase (CS) well concentrations glycogen, glucose, creatine phosphate brain, liver, white muscle. brain, phylogenetically independent relationship P(crit) tissue LDH, PK, CPK, CS activities expressed relative tissue mass. Hypoxia-tolerant sculpins (those low P(crit) values) higher levels brain LDH, PK, CPK, CS hypoxia-sensitive sculpins. Similarly, LOE(50) regressed brain LDH, PK, CPK activities expressed relative tissue mass, hypoxia-tolerant species (i.e., higher LOE(50)) higher enzyme activities. However, phylogenetic relationship among sculpins taken account, relationship hypoxia tolerance LDH activity remained significant. enzyme activities expressed relative total soluble protein tissue, relationships remained brain LDH activity P(crit) LOE(50). liver white muscle, relationships measures hypoxia tolerance enzyme activity metabolite content. Overall, analysis suggests hypoxia-tolerant sculpins maintain higher maximal activities enzymes involved anaerobic metabolism brain, may adaptation hypoxia.
