 aim present study determine whether mitochondrial activity could regulate myoblast proliferation. demonstrate increase mitochondrial activity L6E9 myoblasts easily obtained simply raising extracellular pyruvate concentration culture dish. condition, L6E9 myoblasts underwent rapid growth arrest G1 + phases concomitant marked cellular hypertrophy. sign myoblast fusion evident. accompanied down-regulation proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression increase p21 expression. Mitochondrial biogenesis also stimulated, indicated twofold increase mitochondrial content. cells exhibited large increase production reactive oxygen species could contribute observed phenotypic alterations. However, exposure pyruvate-treated cells antioxidants reverse growth arrest. Similarly, exposure control cells oxidants induce growth arrest. observations suggest mitochondrial activity appears play central role regulating myoblast proliferation. also argue strongly favor retrograde communication establishing mitochondrial control nuclear gene expression could modulated mitochondrial activity.
