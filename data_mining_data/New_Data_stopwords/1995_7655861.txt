 examined DNA fifteen unrelated pyruvate kinase deficient patients hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) molecular alterations responsible enzyme deficiency. 3 30 putative mutations identified. Fourteen different mutations found. Nine missense mutations: 320 T-->C, 823 G-->C, 1276 C-->T, 1378 G-->A, 1484 C-->T, 1529 G-->A, 1654 G-->A, 1675 C-->G; three nonsense mutations: 603 G-->A, 721 G-->T, 1501 C-->T; one insertion 1574 GGG-->GGGG three nucleotide in-frame deletion 391-392-393 ATC. Eight mutations previously described. also investigated patients C/A polymorphism nt 1705 microsatellite ATT repeat intron 11. mutations previously reported us (391-393del, 721T, 1484T, 1529A) found context haplotype earlier cases, supporting concept may single origin.
