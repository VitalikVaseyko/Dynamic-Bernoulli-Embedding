 growing appreciation beneficial attributes allosteric drugs. However, development special class drugs large part via serendipitous findings high-throughput screens drug libraries. Limited success deliberately identifying allosteric drugs may due focus enzyme inhibitors, parallel historic focus competitive inhibitors. contrast inhibition, activation enzyme small molecule occur limited number mechanisms, mainly allosteric regulation. Activation human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) effort create glycolytic/gluconeogenic futile cycle one potential mechanism counteract hyperglycemia. Using hL-PYK, demonstrate potential drug library screens identify allosteric-activator drug leads.
