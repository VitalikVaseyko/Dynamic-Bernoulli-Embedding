 genetic locus designated Dpg two alleles outbred Long-Evans rats. Genotype locus affects quantities red cell 2,3- diphosphoglycerate (DPG) adenosine triphosphate, well activities two important glycolytic enzymes: phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Intravascular red cell survival shortened low-DPG animals. order get closer specific action locus, addressed question whether Dpg gene acts intracorpuscular extracorpuscular factors. Bone marrow transplantation total body irradiation 51Cr red cell survival cross transfusion methods used. animals used differed hemoglobin phenotype, donor recipient cells could quantified cross-transplanted animals. Phenotypic markers Dpg genotype measured animals 40 50 days transplantation. Values markers correlated highly percentage donor recipient cells present. vivo survival low-DPG red cells significantly shorter high-DPG cells (P less .05), regardless genotype recipient. present studies, conclude action Dpg gene exerted intracorpuscular factor.
