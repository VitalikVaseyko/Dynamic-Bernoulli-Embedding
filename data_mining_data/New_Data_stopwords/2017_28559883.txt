 Streptococcus mutans (MS) biotype strains frequently found dental plaque young children. results indicate children pyruvate kinase (PK) activity increases significantly dental plaque, corresponds caries progression. MS strains isolated study main glycolytic metabolism connected PK enzymes might useful risk factors studying pathogenesis target points novel therapies dental caries. relationship PK activity, cariogenic biofilm formation selected biotypes occurrence studied. S. mutans dental plaque samples collected supragingival plaque individual deciduous molars 143 subjects. PK activity measured different time points biofilm formation. Patients divided two groups: initial stage decay, extensive decay. Non-parametric analysis variance analysis covariance used determine connections S. mutans levels, PK activity dental caries biotypes. total 143 strains derived subjects caries. Biotyping data showed 62, 23, 50, 8 strains classified biotypes I, II, III, IV, respectively. PK activity biotypes I, II, IV significantly higher comparison biotype III. correlation level S. mutans dental plaque PK activity statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive. greater level S. mutans biofilm (colony count total biomass), higher PK activity; similarly, low bacterial count correlated low PK activity.
