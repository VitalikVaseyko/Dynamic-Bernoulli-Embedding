 PPARalpha agonism impairs mitochondrial function, effect PPARdelta agonism mitochondrial function equivocal. Furthermore, PPARalpha delta agonism increases muscle fatty acid oxidation, potentially via activation FOXO1 signalling PDK4 transcription. Since FOXO1 activation also suggested increase transcription MAFbx MuRF-1, thereby activation ubiquitin-proteasome mediated muscle proteolysis, raises possibility muscle fuel selection induction muscle atrophy programme could regulated single common signalling pathway. therefore investigated effect PPARdelta (delta) agonist, GW610742, administration muscle mitochondrial function, fuel regulation, atrophy growth related signalling pathways vivo. Twenty-four male Wistar rats received vehicle GW610742 (5 100 mg per kg body mass (bm)) orally 6 days. Soleus muscle used determine maximal rates ATP production (MRATP) isolated mitochondria, gene protein expression, enzyme activities. MRATP unchanged GW610742. Muscle PDK2 PDK4 mRNA expression increased GW610742 (100 mg (kg bm)(-1)) compared vehicle (P<0.05), paralleled twofold increase PDK4 protein expression (P<0.05). activity beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase increased GW610742 (P<0.05). Muscle MuRF1 MAFbx mRNA expression increased GW610742 (100 mg (kg bm)(-1)) compared vehicle (P<0.05), matched increased protein expression (P<0.001), whilst Akt1 protein declined (P<0.05). effect GW610742 20S proteasome activity mRNA expression, muscle DNA: protein ratio. GW610742 switched muscle fuel metabolism towards decreased carbohydrate use enhanced lipid utilization, induce mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, GW610742 initiated muscle atrophy programme, possibly via changes Akt1/FOXO/MAFbx MuRF1 signalling pathway.
