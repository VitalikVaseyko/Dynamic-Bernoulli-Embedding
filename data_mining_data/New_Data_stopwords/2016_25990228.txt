 Pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2), key glycolytic enzyme, involved ATP generation pyruvate production, participates tumor metabolism, growth, multiple cellular processes. However, one attractive biological function PKM2 translocates nucleus induces cell apoptosis. Recently, increased PKM2 found age-related macular degeneration (AMD), little known regarding function AMD pathophysiology. investigate whether PKM2 participated retinal degeneration, performed light-induced retinal damage model adult rats. Western blot immunohistochemistry analysis showed significant up-regulation PKM2 retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) layer (GCL) light exposure. Immunofluorescent labeling indicated PKM2 located mainly RGCs. Co-localization PKM2 active caspase-3 well TUNEL RGCs suggested PKM2 might participate RGC apoptosis. addition, expression patterns cyclin D1 phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) parallel PKM2. Furthermore, PKM2, cyclin D1, active caspase-3 protein expression decreased intravitreal injection U0126, highly selective inhibitor MAPK/ERK kinase. Collectively, hypothesized PKM2 might participate RGC apoptosis light-induced retinal damage medicated p-ERK cycle re-entry mechanism.
