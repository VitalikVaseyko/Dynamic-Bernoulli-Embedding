 Several experiments permeabilized heart muscle fibers suggest existence diffusion restrictions grouping mitochondria surrounding ATPases. specific causes restrictions known, intracellular structures speculated act diffusion barriers. work, assume diffusion restrictions induced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), cytoskeleton proteins localized near SR, crowding cytosolic proteins. aim work test whether localization diffusion restrictions would consistent available experimental data evaluate extent restrictions. that, three-dimensional finite-element model composed geometry based mitochondrial SR structural organization. Diffusion restrictions induced SR cytoskeleton proteins varied model parameters fit set experimental data obtained permeabilized rat heart muscle fibers. many sets model parameters able reproduce experiments considered work. However, sets, <5-6% surface formed SR associated cytoskeleton proteins permeable metabolites. low level permeability indicates proteins play dominant part formation diffusion restrictions.
