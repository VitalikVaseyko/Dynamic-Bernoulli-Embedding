 Polymyositis (PM) inflammatory muscle disease caused autoimmune dysfunction, considered caused cytotoxic CD8 cells. date, autoantigens identified. attempted induce experimental allergic myositis (EAM) BALB/c mice inoculating syngeneic dendritic cells (DC) presenting peptides expected match binding anchor motif H-2K(d) (BALB/c). selected peptides highly expressed skeletal muscle. inoculated syngeneic bone marrow-derived DC presenting pyruvate kinase M1/M2 peptide 464-472 BALB/c mice, 41.7% mice (EAM) developed pathological changes skeletal muscle compatible human PM. conditions (when inoculated DC presenting synthetic peptides BALB/c C57BL/6 mice DC presenting pyruvate kinase M1/M2 peptide C57BL/6 mice), necrotizing inflammatory lesions. Induction EAM manner also induced CTL activity P815 cells peptide syngeneic differentiated cultured myotubes without peptides chromium release assay. Consistent similarity binding anchor motif H-2K(d) (BALB/c) HLA A*2402, conclude pyruvate kinase M1/M2 peptide candidate autoantigen BALB/c-EAM also human-PM HLA A*2402 allele.
