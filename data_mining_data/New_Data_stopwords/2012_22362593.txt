 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) common pathological subtype kidney cancer. Here, integrated unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen ccRCC survival regulators analysis recurrently overexpressed genes ccRCC identify new therapeutic targets disease. One potent survival regulators, monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 (SLC16A3), impaired ccRCC viability eight ccRCC lines tested seventh overexpressed gene meta-analysis five ccRCC expression datasets. MCT4 silencing impaired secretion lactate generated glycolysis induced cell cycle arrest apoptosis. Silencing MCT4 resulted intracellular acidosis, reduction intracellular ATP production together partial reversion Warburg effect ccRCC cell lines. Intra-tumoural heterogeneity intensity MCT4 protein expression observed primary ccRCCs. MCT4 protein expression analysis based highest intensity expression primary ccRCCs associated poorer relapse-free survival, whereas modal intensity correlated Fuhrman nuclear grade. Consistent potential selection subclones enriched MCT4 expression disease progression, MCT4 expression greater sites metastatic disease. data suggest MCT4 may serve novel metabolic target reverse Warburg effect limit disease progression ccRCC.
