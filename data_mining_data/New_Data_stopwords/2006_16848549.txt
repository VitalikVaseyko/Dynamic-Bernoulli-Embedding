 Pale, soft, exudative (PSE) meat recognized decades. Fast glycolysis early post-mortem stage muscle temperature still high cause PSE meat. elucidate molecular mechanism underlying fast glycolysis muscle become PSE meat, post-mortem ATP metabolism, fructose-2,6-diphosphate content, activities AMPK, glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase examined post-mortem muscle. Earlier faster post-mortem AMPK activation responsible significantly lower pH higher lactic acid accumulation (p<0.05) seen PSE muscle, resulted occurrence PSE meat. muscle became PSE meat, AMPK activated 0 h post-mortem reached maximal activation 0.5 h post-mortem, whereas AMPK reached maximal activation 1 h post-mortem normal pork loin. Higher fructose-2,6-diphosphate content (p<0.05) detected PSE muscle compared normal muscle early post-mortem stage. However, difference activities glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate kinase, rate-controlling enzymes glycogenolysis glycolysis, respectively, detected PSE normal pork loins. fructose-2,6-diphosphate product phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2), data suggest AMPK regulates post-mortem glycolysis phosphorylation activation PFK-2, up-regulates activity phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), key rate-controlling enzyme glycolysis. Early AMPK activation PSE muscle associated early consumption ATP, higher AMP IMP contents lower ATP content detected PSE meat compared normal meat. mechanisms causing early AMPK activation PSE meat may exist, warrants investigation.
