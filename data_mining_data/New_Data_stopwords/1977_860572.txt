 Setaria cervi, filarial parasite inhabiting Indian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis Linn.) contained almost enzymes involved glycogen degradation. Significant activities glycogen phosphorylase, glucokinase, phosphoglucomutase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, FDP-aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphopyruvate hydratase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase detected cell-free extracts whole worms. presence PEP-carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase fumarate reductase revealed functioning PEP-succinate pathway addition phosphorylating glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway parasite. Excepting fumarate reductase enzymes localized particulate-free cytosol fraction, although small amounts glycogen phosphorylase, aldolase lactate dehydrogenase also detected mitochondrial fraction.
