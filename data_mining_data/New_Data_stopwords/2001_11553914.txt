 endoderm differentiation F9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, induced sodium butyrate (NaBu) retinoic acid (RA), gene expressions alkaline phosphatase (ALPase), pyruvate kinase (PKase) 5' ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase (5'-Nase) examined. specific activity ALPase found increase 3.5-fold 48 hr treatment NaBu. contrast, specific activity PKase decreased 63%. Northern blot analysis revealed elevation ALPase activity resulted increase level liver/bone/kidney (L/B/K)-type ALPase mRNA decrease PKase activity dependent reduction level M(2)-PKase mRNA. Interestingly, NaBu removed culture medium, levels mRNAs reverted original levels 16 h. processes, specific activity 5'-Nase level mRNA remained unchanged. contrast, F9 cells treated RA, level L/B/K-type ALPase mRNA increased. Lastly, examined issue whether increase level ALPase mRNA dependent transcriptional activation mouse L/B/K-type ALPase gene. Transient transfection assays using luciferase reporter constructs showed promoter activity increased result treatment RA NaBu.
