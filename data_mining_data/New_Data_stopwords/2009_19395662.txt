 ubiquitous tripeptide glutathione (GSH) essential factor many biological processes, thus depletion major impact cell function survival. study, examined regulation GSH cardiomyocytes chronic oxidative stress elicited myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac dysfunction induced rats coronary artery ligation, experiments conducted myocytes isolated non-infarcted left ventricle septum 6-8 weeks. Fluorescence microscopy studies using probe monochlorobimane showed [GSH] myocytes post-MI hearts 42% less sham control hearts (P < 0.05). However, depleted GSH levels normalized 5-6 h insulin mimetic (bis-peroxovanadium-1,10-phenanthroline, bpV(phen); 10 micromol l(-1)) exogenous pyruvate (5 mmol l(-1)). increase [GSH] bpV(phen) partly inhibited buthionine sulphoximine (BSO; 50 micromol l(-1)), blocker GSH synthesis, 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU; 100 micromol l(-1)), inhibitor glutathione disulphide reductase. comparison, effect pyruvate altered BSO completely blocked BCNU. Studies using inhibitors signalling cascades indicated upregulation [GSH] bpV(phen) myocytes post-MI hearts mediated mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. effect pyruvate altered kinase inhibitor tested. cells loaded probe TEMPO-9-AC monitor superoxide anion, baseline fluorescence 2.3-fold greater post-MI myocytes sham control myocytes (P < 0.05) markedly decreased diphenyleneiodonium (30 micromol l(-1)), inhibitor NADPH oxidase, exogenous GSH (10 mmol l(-1)) bpV(phen). parallel studies, [GSH] post-MI myocytes also normalized diphenyleneiodonium exogenous GSH. data show GSH differentially regulated receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent -independent agonists maintain functional GSH levels necessary neutralize excess generation reactive oxygen species failing heart.
