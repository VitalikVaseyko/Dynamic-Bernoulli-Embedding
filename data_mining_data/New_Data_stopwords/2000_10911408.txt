 OBJECTIVES: investigate participation thyroxine regulation energy metabolism neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes bone marrow precursors. MATERIALS METHODS: influence L-thyroxine (T4; 4 mg/kg every 12 hr day 2 10 age) estimated activity hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) cytochrome C-oxidase bone marrow myeloid cells circulating neutrophils 3, 5 10 day (d) old piglets. Serum T4 3,5, 3'-triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations estimated every stage experiment radioimmunoassay. Bone marrow cells myeloid lineage blood neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes separated differential centrifugation haematopoietic cell suspension using Ficoll-Hypaque gradients. RESULTS: hyperthyroid status resulted significant increase PFK LDH activity myelokaryocytes 3 3-5 piglets, activity HK PK cells 3-10 animals remained unchanged. Moreover, ICDH activity myelokaryocytes increased day 10 cytochrome C oxidase bone marrow cells intervals. Marked increase HK LDH activity day 3-5 found also blood polymorphonuclear granulocytes, PFK PK activity increased whole period. time even increase ICDH cytochrome C-oxidase activity observed, respectively, 3 5-10 old piglet neutrophils. Besides that, T4 inhibited G-6-PDH activity myeloid cells day 3 10 influence enzyme activity circulating leukocytes. CONCLUSIONS: administration T4 resulted preferential stimulation oxidative stages carbohydrate catabolism myelocaryocytes, activity glycolytic enzymes cells less affected. contrary, enzymes glycolysis blood neutrophils showed higher sensitivity T4 action compared catalysts oxidative reactions. intensity pentose phosphate pathway seems inhibited bone marrow myelocaryocytes T4 treated animals, blood leukocytes remained unaffected.
