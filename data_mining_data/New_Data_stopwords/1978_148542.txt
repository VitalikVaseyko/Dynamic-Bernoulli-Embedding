 Numerous enzyme defects-deficiency pyruvate kinase, phosphofructo-kinase, glocosephosphate isomerase, adenylate kinase, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase glutathione reductase--in red blood cells described connected dyserythropoietic refractory anemias panmyelopathies different origin. enzyme deficiencies also demonstrated red cells patients acute leukemia. likely enzyme deficiencies acquired important origin anemia bone marrow insufficiency. Partial derepression fetal genes, qualitative quantitative perturbations genetic expression, posttranslational variations enzyme protein low molecular factors plasma, erythrocytes leukemic cells discussed reason enzyme deficiency. decrease glutathione reductase deficiency dependent FAD deficiency.
