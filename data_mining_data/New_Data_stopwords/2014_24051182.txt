 Targeting tumor metabolism emerging novel therapeutic strategy cancer. Dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), shown exert potent tumoricidal action variety tumor cells. main mode antineoplastic action implicates shift glycolysis oxidative metabolism glucose, leading generation cytotoxic reactive oxygen intermediates. However, effect DCA tumor microenvironment, turn regulates tumor cell survival; remains speculative large extent. also unclear DCA exert modulatory effect process hematopoiesis, compromised state tumor-bearing hosts undergoing chemotherapy. view lacunas, present study undertaken investigate far unexplored aspects respect molecular mechanisms DCA-dependent tumor growth retardation chemosensitization. BALB/c mice transplanted Dalton's lymphoma (DL) cells, cell lymphoma spontaneous origin, followed administration DCA without cisplatin. DCA-dependent tumor regression chemosensitization cisplatin found associated altered repertoire key cell survival regulatory molecules, modulated glucose metabolism, accompanying reconstituted tumor microenvironment respect pH homeostasis, cytokine balance alternatively activated TAM. Moreover, DCA administration also led alteration MDR phenotype tumor cells myelopoietic differentiation macrophages. findings study shed new light respect novel mechanisms underlying antitumor action DCA thus may immense clinical applications.
