 determined value creatine pyruvate kinase (CK PK) carrier detection evaluating 811 females 73 families participating Collaborative Investigation Duchenne Dystrophy. Thirty-nine obligate carriers, 244 normal controls (paternal females), well 76 possible carriers 351 carrier suspects three CK PK specimens analyzed central laboratory. CK PK values varied age normals: fell age early life, CK rose fifth decade. Discriminant analysis indicated combination mean CK PK corrected age yielded best data calculation carrier probability. Using best model, 45% obligate carriers could identified false-positive rate 2.5%. Daughters obligate carriers disproportionate decline CK PK age compared noncarrier females, suggesting rate carrier detection higher first two decades. low rate carrier detection, compared studies, may reflect age obligate carrier population use control group representative carrier population.
