 Reprogramming energy metabolism recently added list hallmarks define cancer. Cellular metabolism plays central role cancer initiation progression metastatic disease. Genotypic phenotypic metabolic alterations seen throughout tumourigenesis, allowing cancer cells sustain increased rates proliferation. Furthermore, shift fuels necessary substrates nucleotide, protein, lipid synthesis support cell growth. Beyond 'Warburg effect', widely observed increase glycolytic processing glucose cancer cells, numerous metabolic changes characterized cancer. Metabolomics provides valuable platform investigation metabolic perturbations occur different disease states using systems biology approach determine metabolic profiles biological samples. cell metabolism complex network interdependent pathways, local alterations impact overall tumor metabolism. review, highlight particular pathways, including glycolysis, nucleotide biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, bioenergetics eye towards selected metabolic targets may provide novel approach therapeutic development. Specific regulatory factors, including Myc, p53, HIF-1 mTOR briefly highlighted, well key signaling pathways affect cellular metabolism. demonstrate powerful utility high-throughput metabolite profiling techniques, present practical example metabolomic profiling metastatic cells derived lung cancer metastasis model.
