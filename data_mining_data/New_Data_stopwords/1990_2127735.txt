 show deletion mutagenesis, followed vivo vitro analysis, binding protein factor upstream activation sequence (UAS) Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycolytic gene PYK, encoding pyruvate kinase, required efficient transcription corresponding coding region. addition, gel electrophoretic mobility shift DNase protection studies, involving yeast gene products expressed E. coli, suggest trans-acting DNA-binding protein encoding RAP1 gene. identification RAP1 binding sites located within UAS element yeast PYK, PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) ENO1 (enolase) genes, 5'-upstream region ADHI (alcohol dehydrogenase) gene, suggests mechanism coordinate gene expression involving several glycolytic genes may exist yeast.
