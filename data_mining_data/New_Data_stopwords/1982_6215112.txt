 Antibodies pyruvate kinase Neurospora crassa, induced rabbits, used monitor interaction ligands enzyme. technique microcomplement fixation employed probe conformational alterations elicited binding substrates (phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) adenosine diphosphate), allosteric activator (fructose 1,6-diphosphate), inhibitor (valine). binding PEP valine pyruvate kinase pronounced reduction extent complement fixation observed. second substrate, ADP, effect FDP elicited moderate suppression complement fixation. results suggest consequence conformational changes induced PEP valine, antigenic determinants surface pyruvate kinase rendered inaccessible antibodies.
