 Cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (CDP-diglyceride) hydrolase, CDP-diglyceride:L-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase, CDP-diglyceride:sn-glycero-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase release CMP liponucleotide substrate, CDP-diglyceride. developed spectrophotometric assay enzymes using CMP kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase couple release CMP oxidation NADH. assay phospholipid-dependent enzymes found linear time enzyme concentration. assay prove useful continuous monitoring enzymatic activity, determination initial rates reaction, detailed kinetic analysis enzymes. Since several enzymes substrates used coupled assay system, method limited analysis partially purified preparations lacking competing activities.
