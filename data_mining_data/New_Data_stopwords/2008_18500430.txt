 absence exogenous Ca(2+) Mg(2+) presence EGTA, favours release endogenous Ca(2+), polyamine spermine able stimulate activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) energized rat liver mitochondria (RLM). stimulation exhibits gradual concentration-dependent trend, maximum, 140%, 0.5 mM concentration, 30 min incubation. concentrations higher 0.5 mM, spermine still stimulates PDC, compared control, shows slight dose-dependent decrease. Changes PDC stimulation close phosphorylation level E(1alpha) subunit PDC, regulates activity complex, also target spermine. words, progressive dephosphorylation gradually enhances stimulation RLM progressive phosphorylation slightly decreases it. results provide first evidence that, transported RLM, spermine interact various ways PDC, showing dose-dependent behaviour. interaction probably takes place directly specific site spermine one regulatory enzymes PDC, i.e. pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP). interaction spermine PDC may also involve activation another regulatory enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), resulting increase E(1alpha) phosphorylation consequently reduced stimulation PDC high polyamine concentrations. different effects spermine RLM discussed, considering different activities PDP PDK isoenzymes. suggested polyamine low concentrations stimulates isoenzyme PDP(2) high concentrations stimulates PDK(2).
