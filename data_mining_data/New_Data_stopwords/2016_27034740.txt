 Viruses play important role cancerogenesis. estimated approximately 20% cancers linked infectious agents. viral genes modulate physiological machinery infected cells lead cell transformation development cancer. One important adoptive responses cancer cells metabolic change cope continuous requirement cell survival proliferation. review focus DNA viruses alter glucose metabolism transformed cells. Tumor DNA viruses enhance "aerobic" glycolysis upon virus-induced cell transformation, supporting rapid cell proliferation showing Warburg effect. Moreover, viral proteins enhance glucose uptake controls tumor microenvironment, promoting metastasizing tumor cells.
