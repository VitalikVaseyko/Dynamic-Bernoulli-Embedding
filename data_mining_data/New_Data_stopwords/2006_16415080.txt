 Hypoxia relaxes endothelium-denuded bovine coronary arteries (BCA) mechanisms appear involve reactive oxygen species, prostaglandins, nitric oxide. similarities relaxation BCA hypoxia (Po(2) = 8-10 Torr) inhibitors pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) including 6-aminonicotinamide epiandrosterone, measured NADPH NADP found hypoxia caused NADPH oxidation (decreased NADPH/NADP). relaxation hypoxia similar previously reported properties relaxation PPP inhibitors responses associated glutathione oxidation depressed intracellular calcium release calcium influx-mediated contractile responses. Inhibitors potassium channels minimal effects relaxation responses. Relaxation hypoxia PPP inhibitors attenuated thiol reductant (3 mM dithiothreitol) eliciting contraction activator protein kinase C (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate). presence contraction U-46619, relaxation hypoxia PPP inhibitors attenuated sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase pump inhibitor 200 microM cyclopiazonic acid 10 mM pyruvate. Hypoxia decreased BCA levels glucose-6-phosphate ATP. Pyruvate prevented hypoxia-elicited decrease glucose-6-phosphate glutathione oxidation, increased NADPH levels hypoxia levels observed normoxia. Thus hypoxia causes metabolic stress PPP promotes BCA relaxation processes controlled lowering levels cytosolic NADPH.
