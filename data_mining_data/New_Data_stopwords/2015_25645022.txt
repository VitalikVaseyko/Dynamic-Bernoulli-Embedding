 Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate plays important role cancer metabolism. Here, show post-translational modifications patient-derived mutation regulate pyruvate kinase activity PKM2 modulating conformation PKM2 tetramer. determined crystal structures human PKM2 mutants proposed "seesaw" model illustrate conformational changes inactive T-state active R-state tetramers PKM2. Biochemical structural analyses demonstrate PKM2(Y105E) (phosphorylation mimic Y105) decreases pyruvate kinase activity inhibiting FBP (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate)-induced R-state formation, PKM2(K305Q) (acetylation mimic K305) abolishes activity hindering tetramer formation. K422R, patient-derived mutation PKM2, favors stable, inactive T-state tetramer strong intermolecular interactions. study reveals mechanism dynamic regulation PKM2 post-translational modifications patient-derived mutation provides structural basis investigation modifications mutations PKM2 yet discovered.
