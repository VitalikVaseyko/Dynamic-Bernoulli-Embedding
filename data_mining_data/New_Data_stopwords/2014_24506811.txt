 BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus rhamnosus non-starter lactic acid bacterium plays significant role cheese ripening, leading formation flavor. long-ripened cheeses persists throughout whole time ripening due capacity adapt changing environmental conditions. versatile adaptability L. rhamnosus different ecosystems associated capacity use non-conventional energy sources, regulating different metabolic pathways. However, molecular mechanisms allowing growth L. rhamnosus cheese dairy environment still poorly understood. aim present study identify genes potentially contributing growth ability L. rhamnosus PR1019 cheese-like medium (CB) using transcriptomic approach, based cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Using three primer combinations, total 89 98 transcript-derived fragments obtained L. rhamnosus PR1019 grown commercial MRS medium CB, respectively. cDNA-AFLP results validated selected regulated genes qPCR. order investigate main adaptations growth cheese-mimicking system, focused 20 transcripts over-expressed CB respect MRS. worth noting presence transcripts involved degradation pyruvate ribose. Pyruvate intracellular metabolite produced different metabolic routes starting carbon sources present cheese, released cheese matrix starter lysis. Similarly ribonucleosides released starter lysis could deliver ribose represents fermentable carbohydrate environments, cheese, free carbohydrates lacking.Both pyruvate degradation ribose catabolism induce metabolite flux toward acetate, coupled ATP production via acetate kinase. Taking account considerations, suggest energy produced pathways may concur explain great ability L. rhamnosus PR1019 grow CB. CONCLUSIONS: transcriptomic approach identified set genes involved alternative metabolic pathways L. rhamnosus could responsible L. rhamnosus growth cheese ripening.
