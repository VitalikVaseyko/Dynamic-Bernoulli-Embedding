 Wasting adipose tissue skeletal muscle hallmark metastatic cancer major cause death. Like patients cachexia caused chronic infections inflammatory diseases, cancer subject manifests malnutrition metabolic stress. carbohydrate utilization amino acid incorporation decreased muscles cancer cachexia patients. Cancer cells affect host metabolism two ways: (a) metabolism nutrients metabolites (b) circulating factors secrete induce host secrete. Accelerated glycolysis lactate production, i.e., Warburg effect resultant increase Cori cycle activity, widely discussed metabolic effects. Meanwhile, although large number pro-cachexia circulating factors found, TNFa, IL-6, myostatin, PTHrp, none shown dominant factor targeted singly treat cancer cachexia humans. possible given complex multifactorial nature cachexia secretome, personalized differences cancer patients, targeting single circulating factor would always insufficient treat cachexia patients. review metabolic changes occur response tumor growth tumor-secreted factors cachexia.
