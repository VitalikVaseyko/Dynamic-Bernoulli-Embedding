 1. Changes activities ATP citrate lyase, ;malic' enzyme, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, ability incorporate [1-(14)C]acetate lipid measured livers developing rats late foetal life maturity. 2. male rats activities systems directly indirectly concerned lipogenesis (acetate incorporation lipid, ATP citrate lyase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) fall birth maintained low value weaning. weaning activities rise maximum 30 40 days decline, reaching adult values 60 days. ;Malic' enzyme activity follows similar course, except none could detected foetal liver. Pyruvate kinase activity lower foetal adult livers rises slightly higher adult value post-weaning period. Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase activity rises low foetal value reach maximum 10 days falls rapidly weaning reach adult values 30 days. 3. Weaning rats high-fat diet caused low activities acetate incorporation, ATP citrate lyase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, characteristic suckling period, persist. ;Malic' enzyme fructose 1,6-diphosphatase activities altered appreciably. 4. differences could detected hepatic enzyme activities males females 35 days, time female rats gave higher values acetate incorporation, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity ;malic' enzyme activity. 5. results discussed relation changes alimentation hormonal influences.
