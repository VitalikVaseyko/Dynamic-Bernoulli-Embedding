 Pathological hypertrophy myocardial infarction (MI) two etiologically different cardiac disorders differential molecular mechanisms disease manifestation. However, study conducted far analyze compare differential status energy metabolism two disease forms. shown recently group production ATP significantly impaired MI along inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase E1-beta (PDHE1 B) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). However, ATP levels showed significant change pathological hypertrophy compared control group. seek plausible explanation phenomenon, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR) pathway studied experimental groups revealed PGC1alpha- ERRalpha axis remains active MI remained inactive pathological hypertrophy possibly NF-kappaB plays significant role deactivating pathway hypertrophy. time, observed reactive oxygen species (ROS) negatively regulates NF-kappaB activity MI oxidation cysteine residues p50- DNA binding subunit NF-kappaB. Thus, study reports first time, possible mechanism differential status energy metabolism two etiologically different cardiac pathophysiological conditions involving PGC1alpha-ERRalpha axis along p50 subunit NF-kappaB.
