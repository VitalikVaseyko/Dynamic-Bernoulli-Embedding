 Urea renal medullas sufficiently high perturb macromolecules, yet cells survive function. counteracting osmolytes hypothesis holds methylamines, glycine betaine (betaine) glycerophosphocholine (GPC) renal medullas, stabilize macromolecules oppose effects urea. Although betaine counteracts effects urea macromolecules vitro protects renal cells urea tissue culture, renal cells accumulate GPC rather betaine response high urea vivo tissue culture. proposed explanation GPC counteracts urea effectively betaine. However, previously found GPC slightly less effective betaine counteracting inhibition pyruvate kinase activity urea. test another macromolecule, compare GPC betaine counteracting reduction thermal stability Rnase urea. find urea decreases thermal transition temperature betaine GPC increase it, counteracting urea approximately equally. Therefore, preference GPC response high urea presumably basis, lower metabolic cost GPC accumulation.
