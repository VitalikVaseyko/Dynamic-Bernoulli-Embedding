 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) recognized hepatic component metabolic syndrome. Although NAFLD major cause cirrhosis cancer liver unknown cause, established pharmacological treatment NAFLD established yet. reported leptin treatment improved fatty liver dramatically well insulin resistance hyperphagia patients lipodystrophy. However, unclear whether leptin improves fatty liver independently metabolic improvements. investigated liver effect leptin independently insulin sensitization appetite suppression using hepatocyte-specific Pten-deficient (AlbCrePtenff) mouse, model severe fatty liver insulin hypersensitivity. Male AlbCrePtenff mice infused subcutaneously leptin (20 ng/g/h) 2 weeks using osmotic minipumps. Leptin infusion effectively reduced liver weight, liver triglyceride content, glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) concentrations well food intake body weight without change plasma insulin concentration AlbCrePtenff mice. Pair-feeding also reduced body weight liver triglyceride content. Pair feeding reduced alpha1 alpha2 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities PGC1alpha gene expression liver, leptin infusion unchanged them. present study clearly demonstrated leptin improve fatty liver independently insulin sensitization suppression food intake. suggested leptin improves fatty liver stimulation beta-oxidation liver. present study might provide understanding mechanism metabolic effect leptin.
