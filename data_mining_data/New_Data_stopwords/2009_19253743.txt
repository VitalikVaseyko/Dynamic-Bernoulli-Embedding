 Decrease intensity lactate accumulation activity glycolytic enzyme as: phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, pyruvate kinase found staphylococcus second group isolated vaginosis comparison staphylococcus third group isolated vaginosis concomitant additional infection pathology well comparison staphylococcus first control group. Minimal inhibitory effect (MIA) increase enzyme activity pentosephosphate ways as: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, transketolase testify intensification pentose-phosphate ways decrease activity found second groups staphylococcus isolated vaginosis comparison third group isolated vaginosis additional infection pathology well comparison first control group staphylococcus isolated normal state UGT.
