 Proliferating cancer cells oxidize glucose glycolytic pathway. Since metabolism less profitable terms ATP production, cancer cells consume large quantity glucose, experience insufficient blood supply become glucose-addicted. analyzed response glucose depletion WRO FTC133 follicular thyroid cancer cells, differ expression two key regulators glucose metabolism. WRO cells, express wild type p53 PTEN, showed higher rate cell proliferation much less sensitive glucose-depletion FTC133 cells, PTEN null express mutant p53. Glucose depletion slowed-down autophagy flux FTC133 cells, WRO cells. wound-healing assay, WRO cells shown migrate faster FTC133 cells. Glucose depletion slowed cell migration rate, effects evident FTC133 cells. Genetic silencing either wild-type PTEN p53 WRO cells resulted increased uptake glucose, whereas ectopic expression PTEN FTC133 cells resulted diminished glucose uptake. conclusion, compared WRO, FTC133 cells higher glucose up-taker consumer. data support general contention cancer cells lacking PTEN expressing mutant p53R273H aggressive prone better face glucose depletion. propose concurrent PTEN deficiency mutant p53 leads glucose-addiction state renders cancer cell sensitive glucose restriction. present observation substantiates view glucose-restriction may adjuvant strategy combat tumours.
