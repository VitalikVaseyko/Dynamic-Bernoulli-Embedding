 Deiodinases selenoenzymes catalyze thyroid hormones (THs) activation (type 1 type 2, D1 D2, respectively) inactivation (type 3, D3). THs essential proper body development cellular differentiation. intra- extra-cellular concentrations tightly regulated deiodinases pre-receptorial control thus generating active inactive form THs. Changes deiodinases expression anatomically temporally regulated influence downstream TH signaling. D3 overexpression feature proliferative tissues embryo cancer tissues. enhanced TH degradation D3 induces local hypothyroidism, thus inhibiting THs transcriptional activity. note, overexpression D3 feature several highly proliferative cancers. paper, review recent advances role D3 cancer growth, stemness, metabolic phenotype. particular, focus main signaling pathways result overexpression D3 cancer cells known relevant cancer development, progression, recurrence. also discuss potential role D3 cancer stem cells metabolic phenotype, emerging topic cancer research.
