 assessed sensitivity specificity tests detect carriers Duchenne muscular dystrophy use three serum enzymes (creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, aldolase) discriminant analysis 21 obligate heterozygotes 28 normal controls. found significant age effects enzyme levels. enzyme level considered separately significantly higher heterozygotes. Use logs improved discrimination, log CK sufficient discriminant (that is, addition enzymes significantly improve discrimination). present procedures generate posteriori probabilities genetic counselling incorporate prior probabilities enzyme levels. results show improved sensitivity (90%) specificity (86%).
