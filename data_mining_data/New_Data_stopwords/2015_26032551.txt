 Metabolism heavily investigated topic cancer research past decade. Although role aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) cancer extensively studied, abnormalities metabolic pathways understood cancer. One pathway glycogen metabolism; involvement cancer development, particularly urothelial malignancies, possible ways exploiting aberrations process treatment currently studied. New research shows glycogen debranching enzyme amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase (AGL) novel tumour suppressor bladder cancer. Loss AGL leads rapid proliferation bladder cancer cells. Another enzyme involved glycogen debranching, glycogen phosphorylase, shown tumour promoter cancer, including prostate cancer. Studies demonstrate bladder cancer cells AGL expression lost metabolically active cells intact AGL expression, cells sensitive inhibition glycolysis glycine synthesis--two targetable pathways. tumour promoter enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase directly targeted, preclinical inhibitor studies promising. However, glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors tested cancer treatment clinical setting. Several possible limitations targeting AGL glycogen phosphorylase might also exist.
