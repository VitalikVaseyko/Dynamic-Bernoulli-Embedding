 MicroRNAs (miRNA) play crucial roles regulating cell proliferation, differentiation developmental timing. Aberrantly expressed miRNAs recently emerged key regulators metabolism. However, little known role tumor metabolism cervical cancer. study, determined oncogenic effects miRNAs Warburg effect, metabolic phenotype allows cancer cells utilize glucose even aerobic conditions. gain-of-function study performed 12 down-regulated miRNAs frequently reported cervical cancer. found miR-34a plays suppressive role Warburg effect evidenced decreased lactate production glucose consumption. Knockdown oncoprotein E6 expression human papillomavirus SiHa HeLa cells siRNAs lead increased protein level p53, decreased level miR-34a, well reduced Warburg effect. Subsequently, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), catalyzes last key step glycolysis, identified direct target miR-34a. Silencing LDHA introduction miR-34a significantly attenuated colony formation ability invasive capacity SiHa HeLa cells, effects fully compromised reintroduction LDHA. conclusion, findings demonstrated deregulated miR-34a/LDHA axis induced HPV E6/p53 signaling facilitates tumor growth invasion regulating Warburg effect cervical cancer, provided new insights mechanism miR-34a contributes development progression cervical cancer.
