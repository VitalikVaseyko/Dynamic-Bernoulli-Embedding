 Previously, shown experiments isolated mitochondria almitrine, drug used patients chronic lung disease, affects H+/ATP stoichiometry F0F1-ATPase [Rigoulet, M., Fraisse, L., Ouhabi, R., Guerin, B., Fontaine, E. & Leverve, X. M. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1018, 91-97]. present study, investigated effect almitrine gluconeogenesis oxygen consumption isolated hepatocytes. Almitrine decreased cytosolic mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios effect oxygen consumption cells incubated without octanoate. must due double effect. one hand, decrease ATP/ADP ratio decreases ATP utilization; hand, presence almitrine oxygen required synthesize ATP. Almitrine affect gluconeogenesis various substrates (lactate + pyruvate, glycerone fructose), effect glycerol glutamine metabolism. effect gluconeogenesis glycerone due increase glycolytic flux. rate lactate + pyruvate production increased whereas effect glycerone utilization. effect caused activation pyruvate kinase. data indicate enzyme extremely sensitive sensor cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio. Hence, experimental conditions, cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio decrease affects balance glucose lactate + pyruvate productions, phosphorylation glycerone, first controlling step pathway.
