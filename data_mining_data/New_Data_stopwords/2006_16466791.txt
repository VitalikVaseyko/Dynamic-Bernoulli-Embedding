 assess effects naphthalene liver intermediary metabolism plasma steroid hormones, immature female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), first experiment, intraperitoneally injected (2 microLg(-1)) vegetable oil alone (control) containing naphthalene (10 50 mgkg(-1)) returned tanks. 1, 3, 6h injection, eight fish sampled group. second experiment similarly designed used fish intraperitoneally implanted (10 microLg(-1)) slow-release coconut oil implants alone (control) containing naphthalene doses 10 50 mgkg(-1) body weight sampled 1, 3, 5 days injection. sampling time, plasma hormone levels (cortisol 17beta-estradiol) metabolic parameters plasma (glucose lactate) liver (glucose, lactate, glycogen levels HK, GK, GPase, GDH, FBPase, PK activities) assessed. Changes described hormonal systems resulted decrease plasma levels cortisol 17beta-estradiol. Changes observed intermediary metabolism described effects several pathways liver energy metabolism due naphthalene. changes summarized increased glycogenolysis, use exogenous glucose, glycolysis decreased gluconeogenesis. increased energy production liver suggested changes related increased detoxification activity known occur liver PAH exposure, also related directly indirectly changes observed levels plasma steroids.
