 Zymomonas mobilis growing aerobically 20 g glucose-1 (carbon-limited) chemostat exhibited increase molar growth yield (Yx/s) maximum molar growth yield (Yx/smax) decrease specific substrate consumption rate (qs) maintenance energy consumption rate (me). Stepwise increase input oxygen partial pressure showed anaerobic-to-aerobic transitional adaptation occurred four stages: anaerobic (0 mm HgO2), oxygen-limited (7.6- 230 mm HgO2), intermediate (273 mm HgO2), oxygen excess (290 mm HgO2). steady-state biomass concentration, Yx/s, intracellular ATP content increased oxygen partial pressures 7.6 120 mm HgO2, accompanied decrease qs specific acid production rate. membrane ATPase activity decreased increasing oxygen partial pressure reached lowest levels 273 mm HgO2, highest input oxygen partial pressure steady-state conditions possible. Glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase activities also decreased oxygen partial pressure increased 15 mm Hg, whereas pyruvate decarboxylase unaffected aeration. Growth inhibition 290 mm HgO2 characterised drastic reduction pyruvate kinase activity collapse intracellular ATP pool. growth enzyme data suggest low glucose concentrations oxygen-limited conditions, increase biomass yields reflection redirection ATP usage rather net increase energy production.
