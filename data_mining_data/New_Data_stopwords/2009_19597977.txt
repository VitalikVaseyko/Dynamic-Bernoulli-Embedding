 aim study measure energy fluxes mitochondria isolated permeabilized cardiomyocytes. Respiration permeabilized cardiomyocytes mitochondrial membrane potential measured presence MgATP, pyruvate kinase - phosphoenolpyruvate creatine. ATP phosphocreatine concentrations medium surrounding cardiomyocytes determined. ATP concentration change time, mitochondria effectively produced phosphocreatine (PCr) PCr/O(2) ratio equal 5.68 +/- 0.14. Addition heterodimeric tubulin isolated mitochondria found increase apparent Km exogenous ADP 11 +/- 2 microM 330 +/- 47 microM, creatine decreased 23 +/- 6 microM. results show directly physiological conditions major energy carrier mitochondria cytoplasm PCr, produced mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK), functional coupling adenine nucleotide translocase enhanced selective limitation permeability mitochondrial outer membrane within supercomplex ATP Synthasome-MtCK-VDAC-tubulin, Mitochondrial Interactosome.
