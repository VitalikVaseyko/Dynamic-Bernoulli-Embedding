 well known skeletal muscle differentiation accompanied appearance many muscle-specific components components generated muscle-specific alternative splicing. clear, however, manner, including timing, system regulates muscle-specific splicing reactions constructed process myogenic differentiation. simultaneously examined changes several splicing patterns neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), beta-tropomyosin, M-type pyruvate kinase genes myogenic differentiation cultured myoblasts using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. NCAM glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor form increased preference transmembrane form immediately induction differentiation, selection NCAM MSD1 (muscle-specific domain 1) exons started abruptly increased time cell-fusion appeared. M2-type pyruvate kinase gradually substituted M1-type molecule. Skeletal muscle-type beta-tropomyosin predominantly selected even myoblasts growth medium. result, transcript genes independently showed temporally distinctive pattern change isoform selecting myogenic differentiation C2C12 cells. observations suggest independent regulation alternative splicing reactions occur myogenic differentiation.
