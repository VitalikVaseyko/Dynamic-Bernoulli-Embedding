 myeloid translocation gene 16 product MTG16 found multiple transcription factor-containing complexes regulator gene expression implicated development tumorigenesis. stable Tet-On system doxycycline-dependent expression MTG16 established B-lymphoblastoid Raji cells unravel molecular functions transformed cells. noticeable finding expression certain genes involved tumor cell metabolism including 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 4 (PFKFB3 PFKFB4), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 1 (PDK1) rapidly diminished MTG16 expressed. Furthermore, hypoxia-stimulated production PFKFB3, PFKFB4 PDK1 inhibited MTG16 expression. genes question encode key regulators glycolysis coupling mitochondrial metabolism commonly found overexpressed transformed cells. MTG16 Nervy Homology Region 2 (NHR2) oligomerization domain NHR3 protein-protein interaction domain required intact inhibition PFKFB3, PFKFB4 PDK1 expression occur. Expression MTG16 reduced glycolytic metabolism mitochondrial respiration formation reactive oxygen species increased. metabolic changes paralleled increased phosphorylation mitogen-activated protein kinases, reduced levels amino acids inhibition proliferation decreased fraction cells S-phase. Overall, findings show MTG16 serve brake glycolysis, stimulator mitochondrial respiration inhibitor cell proliferation. Hence, elevation MTG16 might anti-tumor effect.
