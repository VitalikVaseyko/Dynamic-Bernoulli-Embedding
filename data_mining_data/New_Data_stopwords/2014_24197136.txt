 Cancer cells produce energy aerobic glycolysis, contributions host tissues cancer energy metabolism unclear. study, aimed elucidate cancer-host energy production relationship, particular, cancer energy production host muscle. development progression colorectal cancer, expression secreted autophagy-inducing stress protein HMGB1 increased muscle tumor-bearing animals. effect associated decreased expression pyruvate kinase PKM1 pyruvate kinase activity muscle via HMGB1 receptor advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). However, muscle mitochondrial energy production maintained. contrast, HMGB1 addition colorectal cancer cells increased lactate fermentation. muscle, HMGB1 addition induced autophagy decreasing levels active mTOR increasing autophagy-associated proteins, plasma glutamate, (13)C-glutamine incorporation acetyl-CoA. mouse model colon carcinogenesis, temporal increase HMGB1 occurred serum colonic mucosa increase autophagy associated altered plasma free amino acid levels, increased glutamine, decreased PKM1 levels. differences abolished administration HMGB1 neutralizing antibody. Similar results obtained mouse xenograft model human colorectal cancer. Taken together, findings suggest HMGB1 released tumorigenesis recruits muscle supply glutamine cancer cells energy source.
