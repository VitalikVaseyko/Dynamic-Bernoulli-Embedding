 BACKGROUND: Molecular engineering intermediary physiology cyanobacteria become important sustainable production biofuels commodity compounds CO2 sunlight "designer microbes." chemical commodity product L-lactic acid synthesized one step key intermediary metabolite organisms, pyruvate, catalyzed lactate dehydrogenase. Synthetic biology engineering make "designer microbes" includes introduction overexpression product-forming biochemical pathway. optimization product formation, modifications surrounding biochemical network intermediary metabolism made. RESULTS: improve light-driven L-lactic acid production CO2, explored several metabolic engineering design principles, using previously engineered L-lactic acid producing mutant strain Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 benchmark. strategies included: (i) increasing expression level relevant product-forming enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), example, via expression replicative plasmid; (ii) co-expression heterologous pyruvate kinase increase flux towards pyruvate; (iii) knockdown phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase decrease flux competing pathway (from phosphoenolpyruvate oxaloacetate). addition, tested selected lactate dehydrogenases, optimized site-directed mutagenesis improve enzyme's affinity co-factor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). carbon partitioning biomass lactic acid increased 5% 50% strain optimization. CONCLUSION: efficient photosynthetic microbial cell factory display high rate extent conversion substrate (CO2) product (here: L-lactic acid). existing CO2-based cyanobacterial cell factories described literature, far control product formation resides genetically introduced fermentative pathway. show strong promoter, combination increased gene expression, take away significant part control step lactic acid production CO2. premises, modulation intracellular precursor, pyruvate, significantly increase productivity. Additionally, production enhancement achieved protein engineering increase co-factor specificity heterologously expressed LDH.
