 Rapid metabolism lactate important aspect bioenergetic adaptation brain non-physiological conditions. low grade hyperammonemia (HA) common condition patients chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, biochemistry lactate turnover low grade HA remains poorly defined. present article describes profile lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes vis-a-vis lactate level brain slices exposed 0.1-0.5 mM ammonia, found exist brain chronic HE. significant increment LDH activity coincided similar increase lactate level brain slices exposed 0.5 mM ammonia. consistent selective increment LDH-4 synthesizes lactate pyruvate concomitant decline LDH-1 catalyzes conversion lactate pyruvate; resulting ~3-fold increase LDH-4/LDH-1 ratio brain slices. PFK2 domain PFK2/FBPase2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) regulates glycolysis maintain pyruvate pool lactate synthesis. PFK2 expression also observed increased ~2-fold (P < 0.001) 0.5 mM ammonia treated brain slices. findings provide enzymatic regulation increased lactate turnover brain exposed moderate HA.
