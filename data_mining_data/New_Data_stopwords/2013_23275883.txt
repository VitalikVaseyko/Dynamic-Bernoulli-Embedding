 Crabtree effect, fermentative metabolism preferred expense respiration, hallmark budding yeast's glucose response model Warburg effect human tumors. glucose-responsive transcriptional repressors Mig1p Mig2p play well-characterized roles Crabtree effect, little function related Mig3p transcription factor uncovered, despite numerous investigations laboratory yeast strains. studied wild isolate Saccharomyces cerevisiae uncover critical role Mig3p lost S288c-derived laboratory strains. found Mig3p affects expression hundreds glucose-responsive genes oak strain YPS163, growth standard conditions upon ethanol treatment. results suggest Mig3p may act multifunctional activator/repressor plays separate roles standard vs. stress conditions function largely lost lab strains. Population analysis suggests lab strain several wild strains harbor mutations diminish Mig3p function. Thus, expanding attention multiple genetic backgrounds, uncovered important missing link key metabolic response.
