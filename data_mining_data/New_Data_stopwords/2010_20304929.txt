 study designed understand mechanism functional implication two heterozygous mutations (H391Y K422R) human pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme (PKM(2)) observed earlier Bloom syndrome background. co-expression homotetrameric wild type mutant PKM(2) cellular milieu resulting interaction two monomer level substantiated vitro experiments. cross-monomer interaction significantly altered oligomeric state PKM(2) favoring dimerization heterotetramerization. silico study provided added support showing hetero-oligomerization energetically favorable. hetero-oligomeric populations PKM(2) showed altered activity affinity, expression resulted increased growth rate Escherichia coli well mammalian cells, along increased rate polyploidy. features known essential tumor progression. study provides insight understanding modulated role large oligomeric multifunctional proteins PKM(2) affecting cellular behavior, essential observation understand tumor sustenance progression design therapeutic intervention future.
