 Large-scale fed-batch cell culture processes CHO cells standard platform clinical commercial production monoclonal antibodies. Lactate one major by-products CHO fed-batch culture. pH-controlled bioreactors, accumulation high levels lactate accompanied high osmolality due addition base control pH cell culture medium, potentially leading lower cell growth lower therapeutic protein production manufacturing. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme catalyzes conversion substrate, pyruvate, lactate many factors including pyruvate concentration modulate LDH activity. Alternately, pyruvate converted acetyl-CoA pyruvate dehydrogenases (PDHs), metabolized TCA cycle. PDH activity inhibited phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDHKs). study, knocked gene expression lactate dehydrogenase (LDHa) PDHKs investigate effect lactate metabolism protein production. found LDHa PDHKs successfully downregulated simultaneously using single targeting vector carrying small inhibitory RNAs (siRNA) LDHa PDHKs. Moreover, fed-batch shake flask evaluation data using siRNA-mediated LDHa/PDHKs knockdown clones showed downregulating LDHa PDHKs CHO cells expressing therapeutic monoclonal antibody reduced lactate production, increased specific productivity volumetric antibody production approximately 90%, 75% 68%, respectively, without appreciable impact cell growth. Similar trends lower lactate level higher antibody productivity average siRNA clones also observed evaluations performed bioreactors.
