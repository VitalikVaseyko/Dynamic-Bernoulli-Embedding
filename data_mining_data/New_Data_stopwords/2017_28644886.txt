 robust glycolytic metabolism glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) proven susceptible increases oxidative metabolism induced pyruvate mimetic dichloroacetate (DCA). Recent reports demonstrate anti-diabetic drug metformin enhances damaging oxidative stress associated DCA treatment cancer cells. sought elucidate role metformin's reported activity mitochondrial complex inhibitor enhancement DCA cytotoxicity VM-M3 GBM cells. Metformin potentiated DCA-induced superoxide production, required enhanced cytotoxicity towards VM-M3 cells observed combination. Similarly, rotenone enhanced oxidative stress resultant DCA treatment required noted augmentation cytotoxicity. Adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation observed concentration metformin required enhance DCA activity. Moreover, addition activator AMPK enhance DCA cytotoxicity, whereas inhibitor AMPK heightened cytotoxicity combination. data indicate metformin enhancement DCA cytotoxicity dependent complex inhibition. Particularly, complex inhibition cooperates DCA-induction glucose oxidation enhance cytotoxic oxidative stress VM-M3 GBM cells.
