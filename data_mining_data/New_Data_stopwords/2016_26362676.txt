 Metformin inhibits thyroid cancer cell growth. sought determine variable glucose concentrations medium alter anti-cancer efficacy metformin. Thyroid cancer cells (FTC133 BCPAP) cultured high-glucose (20 mM) low-glucose (5 mM) medium treatment metformin. Cell viability apoptosis assays performed. Expression glycolytic genes examined real-time PCR, western blot, immunostaining. Metformin inhibited cellular proliferation high-glucose medium induced cell death low-glucose medium. low-, high-glucose medium, metformin induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, oncosis. micromolar concentrations, metformin induced phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase blocked p-pS6 low-glucose medium. Metformin increased rate glucose consumption medium prompted medium acidification. Medium supplementation glucose reversed metformin-inducible morphological changes. Treatment inhibitor glycolysis (2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG)) increased thyroid cancer cell sensitivity metformin. combination 2-DG metformin led cell death. Thyroid cancer cell lines characterized over-expression glycolytic genes, metformin decreased protein level pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2). PKM2 expression detected recurrent thyroid cancer tissue samples. conclusion, demonstrated glucose concentration cellular milieu factor modulating metformin's anti-cancer activity. data suggest combination metformin inhibitors glycolysis could represent new strategy treatment thyroid cancer.
