 decreased level glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase might result decreased rate synthesis, synthesis enzyme lower catalytic efficiency, increased lability, combined mechanism. test hypothesis increased lability, rate decline enzyme vivo measured three groups individuals, controls, Gd(-),A-males, Gd(-), Mediterranean males, slope decline activity fractions containing erythrocytes progressively increasing mean age. fractions obtained ultracentrifugation discontinuous density gradient erythrocyte suspensions free contaminating platelets leukocytes. rate vivo decline pyruvate kinase (another age-dependent enzyme) also measured found similar three groups. vivo decline glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase found follow exponential rate, half-life 62 days controls 13 days Gd(-),A- erythrocytes. activity normal reticulocytes estimated 9.7 U Gd(-),A- reticulocytes 8.8 U. estimates confirmed direct measurements reticulocytes isolated patients extreme reticulocytosis. Gd(-),Mediterranean erythrocytes activity could demonstrated reticulocytes, estimated average 1.4 U. rate decline extreme activity could detected mature erythrocytes. data suggest glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Gd(A-) GdMediterranean variant results different degrees vivo instability abnormal enzyme.
