 Cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation variant erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) studied. variant PK shows faster electrophoretic mobility normal enzyme. decreased enzyme activity observed variant associated quantitative decrease enzyme protein. parameters within normal ranges. partially purified variant PK phosphorylated subsequent increase k0.5s (phosphoenolpyruvate) similar normal control, suggesting structural abnormality variant enzyme influence phosphorylation-deactivation mechanism. hand, variant PK erythrocyte less extensively phosphorylated PK normal erythrocytes. may result abnormal metabolism patient's red cells, including increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate decreased adenosine triphosphate levels.
