 3-Bromopyruvate (3BP) promising effective anticancer drug many different tumors children adults. 3BP exhibited strong anticancer effects preclinical human studies e.g. energy depletion, oxidative stress, anti-angiogenesis, anti-metastatic effects, targeting cancer stem cells antagonizing Warburg effect. report 3BP metabolism guide researchers oncologists improve clinical practice prevent drug resistance. article, provide evidences 3BP metabolized glutathione (GSH) conjugation novel report 3BP confirmed attached GSH followed permanent loss pharmacological effects picture similar cisplatin. cisplatin 3BP alkylating agents. Reported decrease endogenous cellular GSH content upon 3BP treatment confirmed due formation 3BP-GSH complex i.e. GSH consumption conjugation 3BP. Cancer cells high endogenous GSH exhibit resistance 3BP 3BP sensitive cells acquire resistance upon adding exogenous GSH. thiol blocker, 3BP may attack thiol groups tissues serum proteins e.g. albumin GSH. may decrease 3BP-induced anticancer effects functions proteins. proved 3BP metabolism different metabolism hydroxypyruvate results metabolism D-serine using D-amino acid oxidase. Clinically, 3BP administration monitored albumin infusion protein therapy GSH added emergency medications. GSH exerts many physiological effects safe human administration orally intravenously. Based that, reported GSH-induced inhibition 3BP effects makes 3BP effects reversible, easily monitored easily controlled. confers superiority 3BP many anticancer agents.
