 Cancer cells acquire abnormalities energy metabolism, collectively known Warburg effect, affecting substrate availability thiamine-dependent enzymes. investigate strategy exploit abnormal cancer-associated metabolism related thiamine, tested cytotoxicity native Bacillus thiaminolyticus thiaminase enzyme, digests thiamine, NCI60 cell line drug cytotoxicity screening program found leukemia cell lines among sensitive thiaminase I. obtained additional lymphoid leukemia cell lines confirmed native thiaminase linear chain PEGylated thiaminase enzyme (LCPTE) cytotoxic activity cell lines. addition, IC(50) 3 5 leukemia cell lines (Reh, RS4, Jurkat) least 1,000-fold sensitive Molt-4 cells, turn, among sensitive NCI60 panel. 3 LCPTE-sensitive leukemia cell lines also sensitive removal thiamine medium, thus suggesting mechanism action LCPTE involves extracellular thiamine starvation. Surprisingly, rapamycin showed protective effect LCPTE toxicity 3 LCPTE-sensitive cell lines 2 cell lines, suggesting involvement mTOR-dependent pathway. Immunoblot analysis LCPTE-sensitive cell lines LCPTE exposure revealed changes mTOR pathway phosphorylation. Nude mice bearing RS4 leukemia xenografts showed tumor growth delay prolonged survival single dose LCPTE. Therefore, disruption thiamine-dependent metabolism may novel therapeutic approach target altered energy metabolism leukemia cancers.
