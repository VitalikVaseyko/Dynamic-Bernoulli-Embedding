 report case 19-year-old woman suffering general fatigue exercise intolerance since 15 years old. 18 years old, experienced muscle weakness myalgia calves. Six months later, admitted hospital. showed muscle weakness neck proximal limbs, myalgia calves prominent. Serum levels creatine kinase (CK) lactic acid elevated, level lactic acid cerebrospinal fluid. T2-weighted short-inversion-time inversion recovery (STIR) imaging lower limbs showed hyperintensity bilateral gastrocnemius muscles, region revealed Gd enhancement. Based histopathological findings muscle identification m.3271T>C point mutation, mitochondrial myopathy diagnosed. Rest administration vitamins B1 B2, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine improved serum CK levels; however, exercise intolerance, myalgia, lactic acidemia remained. Sodium pyruvate administered, lactic acid levels, exercise intolerance, findings magnetic resonance imaging improved. Sodium pyruvate could prove effective addressing elevated serum lactic acid levels exercise intolerance mitochondrial disease.
