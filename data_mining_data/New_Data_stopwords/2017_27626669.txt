 histone lysine demethylase KDM4A/JMJD2A implicated prostate carcinogenesis role transcriptional regulation. Here, describe KDM4A E2F1 coactivator demonstrate functional role E2F1-KDM4A complex control tumor metabolism. KDM4A associates E2F1 target gene promoters enhances E2F1 chromatin binding transcriptional activity, thereby modulating transcriptional profile essential cancer cell proliferation survival. pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) PDK1 PDK3 direct targets KDM4A E2F1 modulate switch glycolytic metabolism mitochondrial oxidation. Downregulation KDM4A leads elevated activity pyruvate dehydrogenase mitochondrial oxidation, resulting excessive accumulation reactive oxygen species. altered metabolic phenotypes partially rescued ectopic expression PDK1 PDK3, indicating KDM4A-dependent tumor metabolic regulation via PDK. results suggest KDM4A key regulator tumor metabolism potential therapeutic target prostate cancer.
