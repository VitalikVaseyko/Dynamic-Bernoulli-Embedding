 Wild-type Pseudomonas acidovorans strain A1 unable grow glycerol glucose sole source carbon energy although grew well gluconate. Spontaneous glycerol-positive mutants, apparently become permeable glycerol, readily isolated, glucose-positive mutants occur. P. acidovorans lacked glucose dehydrogenase glucokinase, sufficient account inability grow glucose. Gluconate degraded exclusively via noncoordinately induced Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase undetectable. contrast P. aeruginosa, P. acidovorans possessed single glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, NAD+ specific constitutive, inducible pyruvate kinase. Moreover, growth glycerol-positive strain K2 glycerol induce enzymes related metabolism hexosephosphate derivatives occurs fluorescent pseudomonads.
