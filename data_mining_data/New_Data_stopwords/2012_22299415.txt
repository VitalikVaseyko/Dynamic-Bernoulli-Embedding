 Tuberculosis long recognized one significant public health problems. Finding novel antituberculous drugs always necessary approach controlling disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis pyrH gene (Rv2883c) encodes uridine monophosphate kinase (UMK), key enzyme uridine nucleotide interconversion pathway. enzyme essential M. tuberculosis sustain growth hence potential drug target. study, developed rapid protocol production purification M. tuberculosis UMK cloning pyrH (Rv2883c) M. tuberculosis H37Rv addition 6-histidine residues C-terminus protein, expressing E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL using auto-induction medium. enzyme efficiently purified single-step TALON cobalt affinity chromatography 8 fold increase specific activity, determined coupled assay pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. molecular mass monomeric UMK 28.2 kDa native enzyme 217 kDa. enzyme uses UMP substrate CMP TMP activity enhanced GTP. Measurements enzyme kinetics revealed kcat value 7.6 +/- 0.4 U mg(-1) 0.127 +/- 0.006 sec(-1).The protocol reported used expression M. tuberculosis UMK large quantity formulating high throughput target-based assay screening anti-tuberculosis UMK compounds.
