 chicken pyruvate kinase gene interrupted least ten introns, including nine introns within coding region. compare structure gene three-dimensional protein structure homologous cat muscle enzyme. introns randomly placed--they divide coding sequence fairly uniformly sized pieces encoding discrete elements secondary structure. introns tend fall interruptions stretches alpha-helix beta-sheet residues, six exons contribute barrel-shaped central domain include one two repeats simple unit, alpha-helix plus beta strand. structure suggests introns inserted previously uninterrupted coding sequence, instead products evolution first pyruvate kinase gene. found sequence homology segment pyruvate kinase structurally homologous mononucleotide binding fold alcohol dehydrogenase. superposition two regions aligns intron maize alcohol dehydrogenase gene four nucleotides intron chicken pyruvate kinase gene.
