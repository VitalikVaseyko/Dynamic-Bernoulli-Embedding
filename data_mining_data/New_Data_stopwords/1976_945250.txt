 specific activity placental enzymes regulatory function pathways glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, NADPH generation fatty acid synthesis decrease gestation rat. Similar decreases occur activity enzymes human placenta compared early gestation term, exception activity enzymes related gluconeogenesis tend increase gestation advances. term placentas pregnancies complicated preeclamptic toxemia, enzyme activities significantly lower placentas normal pregnancies, irrespective whether baby normal weight small-for-date. indicates accelerated decline placental metabolic function toxemia. contrast, placentas nontoxemic pregnancies small-for-date babies enzyme activities significantly higher normal term placentas. suggested decrease placental enzyme activity, associated placental growth course normal gestation, retarded nontoxemic pregnancies small-for-date babies, apparently due arrested aging placenta.
