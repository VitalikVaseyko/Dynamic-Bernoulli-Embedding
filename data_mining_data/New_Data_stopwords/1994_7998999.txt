 Freshly isolated viable rat hepatocytes separated five subpopulations shallow discontinuous Percoll density gradients. periportal marker enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) showed gradients increasing activity subpopulation least density (band 1, rho = 1.07 g/ml) subpopulation greatest density (band 5, rho = 1.09 g/ml). perivenous marker enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK) glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) showed gradients decreasing activity band-1 cells band-5 cells. Glutamine synthetase (GS), confined two three cell layers around hepatic venule, almost entirely restricted band-1 hepatocytes. Band-5: band-1 ratios enzyme activity follows: ALT, 8.0; LDH, 2.1; MDH, 1.6; GDH, 0.7; PK, 0.2; GS, 0.01. Band-5:band-1 ratios ALT, LDH, PK GS maintained culture subpopulations identical conditions 72 h, whereas ratios MDH GDH decreased increased respectively towards unity. Band-1 hepatocytes exhibited greater cytotoxicity band-5 cells incubation carbon tetrachloride paracetamol. perivenous-selective toxins produced greater decreases cell viability greater release ALT LDH band-1 hepatocytes band-5 hepatocytes. Conversely, band-5 hepatocytes susceptible band-1 hepatocytes cytotoxic effects 1-naphthylisothiocyanate methotrexate (known periportal-selective toxins). concluded band-5 hepatocytes enriched periportal cells, whereas band-1 hepatocytes enriched perivenous cells. Isolation hepatocyte subpopulations Percoll density-gradient centrifugation considerable advantage periportal perivenous cells obtained liver.
