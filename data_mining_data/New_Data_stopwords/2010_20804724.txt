 last decades considerable amount research focused cancer. Recently, tumor cell metabolism considered possible target cancer therapy. widely accepted tumors display enhanced glycolytic activity impaired oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect). Therefore, seems reasonable disruption glycolysis might promising candidate specific anti-cancer therapy. Nevertheless, concept aerobic glycolysis paradigm tumor cell metabolism challenged, tumor cells exhibit high rates oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial physiology cancer cells linked Warburg effect. Besides, central role apoptosis makes organelle promising "dual hit target" selectively eliminate tumor cells. metabolic point view, fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae tumor cells share several features. paper review common metabolic properties well possible origins Crabtree Warburg effects.
