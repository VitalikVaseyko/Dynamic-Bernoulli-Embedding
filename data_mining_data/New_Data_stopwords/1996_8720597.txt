 Selenium trace element exerts certain insulin-like actions vitro. study, evaluated vivo effects glucose homeostasis rats made diabetic insulin-deficient streptozotocin. Na2SeO4 administered ad libitum drinking water and/or food 10 weeks. elevated plasma glucose levels (approximately 25 mmol/l) glucosuria (approximately 85 mmol/day) untreated rats decreased 50 80%, respectively, selenate treatment. beneficial effect selenate also evident oral intravenous glucose tolerance tests: integrated glucose responses decreased 40-50% compared untreated rats. effects due increase plasma insulin levels. Compared non-diabetic rats, pancreatic insulin reserves reduced 90% treated untreated diabetic rats. hepatic activities mRNA levels two key glycolytic enzymes, glucokinase L-type pyruvate kinase blunted diabetic rats. increased approximately two- threefold selenate treatment, reach 40-75% values non-diabetic rats. contrast, elevated activity mRNA levels gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, reduced 40-65% selenate administration. Since selenate induced moderate decrease body weight due anorexigenic effect, checked improvement glucose homeostasis hepatic glucose metabolism additional group calorie-restricted diabetic rats, weight-matched selenate group. addition, obvious toxic side-effects kidney liver observed rats receiving selenate. conclusion, selenate induces sustained improvement glucose homeostasis streptozotocin-diabetic rats insulin-like action, involves partial correction altered pretranslational regulatory mechanisms liver metabolism.
