 phosphoprotein phosphatase (phosphoprotein phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.16) partially purified rat liver homogenates (NH4)2SO4 ethanol precipitations followed DEAE-cellulose Sepharose 6B chromatography. phosphoprotein phosphatase capable cleaving [32P]phosphate radiolabelled phosphopyruvate kinase (type L) (EC 2.7.1.40), phosphohistones, phosphoprotamine. However, detectably dephosphorylate ATP, ADP, DL-phosphorylserine beta-glycerophosphate. Dephosphorylation [32P]phosphopyruvate kinase stimulated divalent cations inhibited ATP, ADP, Fru-1,6-P2, orthophosphate. Divalene cations could reverse inhibition induced ADP ATP. least one function phosphoprotein phosphatase may remove phosphate groups phosphorylated form pyruvate kinase liver.
