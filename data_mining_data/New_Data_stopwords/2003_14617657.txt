 high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) protein gel electrophoresis technique combined matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time flight mass spectrometry used identification proteins whose levels changed mutation hemB. Cytoplasmic protein extracts obtained mutant wild type (strain COL) different stages growth tryptone soya broth (exponential, transitional, stationary growth phases) separated 2D protein gels. Comparison 2D patterns protein extracts two strains revealed major differences. electron transport chain mutant interrupted due deficiency heme, organism unable use oxygen nitrate terminal electron acceptor. Consistent hypothesis, proteins involved glycolytic pathway related pathways (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase) fermentation pathways (lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, pyruvate formate lyase) induced exponentially growing cells mutant. results strongly indicate hemB mutant generates ATP glucose fructose substrate phosphorylation. Analyses fermentation reactions showed main product lactate. Although pyruvate formate lyase (Pfl) pyruvate dehydrogenase present, neither ethanol acetate detected significant amounts. Presumably, Pfl activated presence oxygen, pyruvate dehydrogenase might low activity. Transcriptional analysis citB, encoding aconitase, revealed activity citrate cycle enzymes down-regulated hemB mutant. arginine deiminase pathway also induced, could provide ATP well. Furthermore, amounts extracellular virulence factors significantly reduced mutation hemB, consistent previous reports.
