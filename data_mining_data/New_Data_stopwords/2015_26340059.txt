 Warburg effect, glycolytic production ATP aerobic conditions, found universal feature cancer cells. study aimed determine whether rosmarinic acid (RA) anti-Warburg effect activity colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, mechanism anti-Warburg effect RA would investigated. study, found RA suppressed glucose consumption lactate generation colorectal carcinoma cells; meanwhile, RA inhibited expression transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) affects glycolytic pathway. Chronic inflammation key promoting factor Warburg effect. supposed, present study also showed RA could repress proinflammatory cytokines using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay could also suppress microRNAs related inflammation real-time PCR. Therefore, proposed RA may inhibit Warburg effect suppressing inflammatory response colorectal carcinoma cells. Recent studies provided evidence miR-155 important mediator inflammation carcinogenesis. showed miR-155 acted repress Warburg effect mechanism inactivating IL-6/STAT3 pathway. all, RA might potential therapeutic agent colorectal carcinoma.
