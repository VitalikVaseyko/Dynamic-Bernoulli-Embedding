 metabolic property skeletal muscle adapts response increased physiological demand altering substrate utilization gene expression. calcium-regulated serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin implicated transduction motor neuron signals alter gene expression programs skeletal muscle. utilized transgenic mice overexpress activated form calcineurin skeletal muscle (MCK-CnA*) investigate impact calcineurin activation metabolic properties skeletal muscle. Activation calcineurin increased glucose incorporation glycogen lipid oxidation skeletal muscle. Activated calcineurin suppressed skeletal muscle glucose oxidation increased lactate release. enhancement lipid oxidation supported increased expression genes lipid metabolism mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. reciprocal fashion, several genes glycolysis down-regulated, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 markedly induced. expression pattern associated decreased glucose utilization enhanced glycogen storage. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) transcription regulators expression metabolic mitochondrial genes. Consistent changes gene-regulatory program, calcineurin promoted expression PPARalpha, PPARdelta, PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha skeletal muscle. results provide evidence calcineurin-mediated skeletal muscle reprogramming induces expression several transcription regulators coordinate changes expression genes lipid glucose metabolism, turn alters energy substrate utilization skeletal muscle.
