 Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) aggressive malignancy long-term survival remains unsatisfactory patients metastatic recurrent disease. Repurposing anti-malarial drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) proved possess potent antitumor effect various cancers. However, effects DHA preventing invasion NSCLC cells studied. present study, determined inhibitory effects DHA invasion migration possible mechanisms involved using A549 H1975 cells. DHA inhibited vitro migration invasion NSCLC cells even low concentration little cytotoxicity. Additionally, low concentration DHA also inhibited Warburg effect NSCLC cells. Mechanically, DHA negatively regulates NF-kappaB signaling inhibit GLUT1 translocation. Blocking NF-kappaB signaling largely abolishes inhibitory effects DHA translocation GLUT1 plasma membrane Warburg effect. Furthermore, GLUT1 knockdown significantly decreased inhibition invasion, migration DHA. results suggested DHA inhibit metastasis NSCLC targeting glucose metabolism via inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway DHA may deserve investigation NSCLC treatment.
