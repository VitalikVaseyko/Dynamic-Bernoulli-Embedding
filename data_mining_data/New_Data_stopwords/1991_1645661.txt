 Recombinant yeast pyruvate kinase purified strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing enzyme high levels. Expression multicopy plasmid control yeast phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. gene expressed absence genomically encoded pyruvate kinase, using strain yeast pyruvate kinase gene disrupted insertion yeast Ura3 gene. purification procedure minimised proteolytic artefacts enabled convenient purification 15-20 mg enzyme 11 culture. purified enzyme characterised high specific activity lack proteolytic degradation. Two active-site mutants yeast pyruvate kinase produced, expressed characterised system preliminary results described.
