 functional changes, associated sequential transformation L'4 L4 pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) studied. L'4 enzyme human erythrocytes shows strong hysteretic behaviour: initial rate enzyme preincubated unsaturating concentration phosphoenolpyruvate much higher enzyme preincubated ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate concentration, although "final activity" (the activity linear part reaction progress curve) cases. phenomenon observed presence absence fructose 1,6-diphosphate. High concentrations Mg2+free MgATP2- diminish difference initial rate, ADP phosphoenolpyruvate preincubated enzymes: Mg2+free stabilizing phosphoenolpyruvate-induced form; ATPMg2- stabilizing ADP-induced form. magnitude difference initial rates ADP-or phosphoenolpyruvate-preincubated enzyme function substrates. L4 pyruvate kinase (either human liver trypsin treated L'4 enzyme) not, slight extent, show behaviour. L'2L2 pyruvate kinase shows behaviour intermediate L'4 L4 enzymes. model proposed describe kinetic behaviour L'4 L4 enzymes.
