 bioenergetic pattern cell clone derived rat lung ultrastructural biochemical characteristics like type II pneumocytes (T-II-P), studied tissue culture system. air cultivation, cells high rate aerobic anaerobic glycolysis associated high activities two rate-limiting enzymes glycolysis (pyruvate kinase [PyKi] phosphofructokinase [PFK]). present despite rates oxygen consumption activities cytochrome oxidase (CyOx) similar lung cells. Presumably high rate aerobic glycolysis explains substantial lactate production previously described lung slices intact perfused lung. Hypoxic cultivation results decrease CyOx. Acute re-exposure air restore oxygen consumption normal, presumably result decreased mitochondrial O(2) utilization associated decreased CyOx activity. result, hypoxically cultivated T-II-P cells decreased capacity mitochondrial ATP generation air compared air-cultivated cells. hypoxia, aerobic anaerobic glycolysis increased well activities PyKi PFK. high rate glycolysis high activities PyKi PFK cultivated T-II-P appear reflect intrinsic genetic regulation. decreased CyOx activity increased PyKi PFK activities hypoxic T-II-P appear reflect alterations enzyme biosynthesis/biodegradation regulated O(2) availability.
