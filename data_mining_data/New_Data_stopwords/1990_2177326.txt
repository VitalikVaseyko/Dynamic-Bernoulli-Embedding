 Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase purified homogeneity rat liver rat heart. initial step purification rat liver heart branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex high kinase activity modification method described previously. Preservation high kinase activity purification complex required presence fresh dithiothreitol throughout procedure. kinase released complex oxidation dithiothreitol potassium ferricyanide purified high-speed centrifugation, immunoadsorption chromatography, DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. kinase preparations gave one polypeptide band molecular weight 44,000 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis presence sodium dodecyl sulfate. Phosphorylation inactivation branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex purified kinase inhibited alpha-chloroisocaproate dichloroacetate, established inhibitors phosphorylation branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. kinase exhibit autophosphorylation correspond protein pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. kinase phosphorylated histone (type II-S), reaction slow relative phosphorylation branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex inhibited alpha-chloroisocaproate.
