 study investigated effects combination fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (CHS) rosiglitazone (RSG) glucose metabolism liver insulin-resistant C57BL/6J mice fed high-fat high-sucrose diet 19 weeks. results showed combination (CHS/RSG) synergistically improved body weight gain, liver weight, fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance oral glucose tolerance test, serum insulin levels, homeostasis model assessment indexes, hepatic glycogen content. liver tissue, CHS/RSG significantly normalized activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase. additionally, increased mRNA expression insulin receptors, insulin receptor substrate 2, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB), glycogen synthase, inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3beta(GSK-3beta) mRNA expression liver. suggests CHS/RSG treatment improves glucose metabolism modulating metabolic enzymes strengthening PI3K/PKB/GSK-3beta signal pathway mediated insulin transcriptional level.
