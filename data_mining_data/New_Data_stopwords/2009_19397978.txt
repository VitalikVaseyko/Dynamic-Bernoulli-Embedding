 AIM STUDY: investigate effects ethanol extract Portulaca oleracea (EEPO) hypoxia models mice find possible mechanism anti-hypoxic actions elucidate anti-hypoxia activity provide scientific basis clinical use Portulaca oleracea. MATERIALS METHODS: EEPO evaluated anti-hypoxic activity several hypoxia mice models, including closed normobaric hypoxia sodium nitrite potassium cyanide toxicosis. verify possible mechanism(s), detected activities pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level adenosine triphosphate (ATP) mice cortices. RESULTS: Given orally, EEPO doses 100, 200, 400 mg/kg could dose-dependently enhance survival time mice normobaric chemical hypoxia models. activity glycolysis enzymes level ATP higher control. pentobarbital sodium-induced sleeping time test open-field test, EEPO neither significantly enhanced pentobarbital sodium-induced sleeping time impaired motor performance, indicating observed anti-hypoxic activity unlikely due sedation motor abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: results demonstrated EEPO possessed notable anti-hypoxic activity, might related promoting activity key enzymes glycolysis improving level ATP hypoxic mice.
