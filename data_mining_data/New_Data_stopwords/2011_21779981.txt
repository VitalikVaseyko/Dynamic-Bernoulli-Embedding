 Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) critical enzyme PI3K/AKT pathway activation AGC family protein kinases, including S6K, SGK, PKC. Dysregulation pathway plays key role cancer cell growth, survival tumor angiogenesis. such, inhibitors PDK1 offer promise new therapeutic modality cancer treatment. Fragment based drug screening recently become viable entry point hit identification. work, NMR spectroscopy fragment screening PDK1 afforded novel chemotypes orthogonal starting points HTS screening hits. Compounds identified hits NMR spectroscopy tested biochemical assay, fragments activity assays clustered. Pfizer compound file mined via substructure 2D similarity search, chemotypes prioritized ligand efficiency (LE), SAR mining, chemical attractiveness, chemical enablement promising vectors. effort, isoquinolone fragment hit, 5 (IC(50) 870 muM, LE = 0.39), identified novel, ligand efficient inhibitor PDK1 suitable scaffold optimization. Initially absence crystallographic data, fragment growing approach efficiently explored four vectors isoquinolone scaffold via parallel synthesis afford compound crystallographic data, 16 (IC(50) 41.4 muM, LE = 0.33). Subsequent lead optimization efforts provided 24 (IC(50) 1.8 muM, LE = 0.42), greater fivefold selectivity key pathway kinases.
