 study aimed investigate association Pyruvate Kinase isozyme type M2 (PKM2) radiation resistance locally advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma (LACSCC). retrospectively reviewed 132 female patients received primary radiation therapy treat LACSCC Federation Internationale Gynecologie Obstetrigue (FIGO) stages IB-IVA. Forty-seven patients progression free survival (PFS) less 36 months regarded radiation resistance. Eighty-five patients PFS less 36 months regarded radiation sensitive. Using immunohistochemistry, found overexpression rate PKM2 radiation resistant radiation sensitive patients 87.2% 57.6%, respectively, difference statistically significant (p<0.001). 5-year progress free survival rates patients low high expression PKM2 80.4% 60.5%, respectively, difference statistically significant (p=0.008). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified high expression PKM2 independent negative prognostic factor cervical cancer patients [Hazard ratio (95% CI), 2.888 (1.347, 6.194) p=0.006]. results demonstrate overexpression PKM2 contributes radiation resistance acts poor prognosis indicator patients LACSCC.
