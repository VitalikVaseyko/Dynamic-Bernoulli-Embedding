 Mammalian adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment display distinct metabolic phenotype compared progenitors. proposed HSCs generate energy mainly anaerobic glycolysis pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Pdk)-dependent manner. Cited2 essential regulator HSC quiescence, apoptosis, function. Herein, show conditional deletion Cited2 murine HSCs results elevated levels reactive oxygen species, decreased cellular glutathione content, increased mitochondrial activity, decreased glycolysis. molecular level, Cited2 deficiency significantly reduced expression genes involved metabolism, Pdk2, Pdk4, lactate dehydrogenases B (LDHB LDHD). Cited2-deficient HSCs also exhibited increased Akt signaling, concomitant elevated mTORC1 activity phosphorylation FoxOs. Further, inhibition PI3/Akt, mTORC1, partially rescued repression Pdk4 caused deletion Cited2. Altogether, results suggest Cited2 required maintenance adult HSC glycolytic metabolism likely regulating Pdk2, Pdk4, LDHB, LDHD, Akt activity.
