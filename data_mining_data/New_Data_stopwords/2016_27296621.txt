 BACKGROUND: Spared nerve injury important neuropathic pain model investigating role intact primary afferents skin pain hypersensitivity. However, potential cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathway, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) participates regulation neuronal plasticity central sensitization. downstream cascades PDK1 include: (1) protein kinase C gamma (PKCg) controls trafficking phosphorylation ionotropic glutamate receptor; (2) protein kinase B (Akt)/the mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling responsible local protein synthesis. statements, therefore hypothesized increase PKCg activation mTOR-dependent PKCg synthesis intact primary afferents SNI might contribute pain hypersensitivity. RESULTS: variants spared nerve injury performed Sprague-Dawley rats transecting two three branches sciatic nerve, leaving one branch intact. Following SNIt (spared tibial branch), mechanical hyperalgesia mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, significantly induced. first footpad, normal epidermal innervations verified protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5)- growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43)-immunoreactive (IR) intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENFs) densities. Furthermore, rapid increases phospho-PKCg- phosphomTOR-IR subepidermal nerve fibers (SENFs) areas distinct gathered results PGP9.5-, GAP43-, neurofilament 200 (NF200)-IR SENFs areas. efficacy PKC inhibitor (GF 109203X) mTOR complex 1 inhibitor (rapamycin) attenuating mechanical hyperalgesia mechanical allodynia intraplantar injection dose-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: results obtained study, strongly recommend intact SENFs persistently increase PKCg activation mTOR-dependent PKCg synthesis participate initiation maintenance mechanical hypersensitivity spared nerve injury, represents novel insight therapeutic strategy pain periphery.
