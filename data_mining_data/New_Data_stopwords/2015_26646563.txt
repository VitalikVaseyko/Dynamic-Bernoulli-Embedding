 Although Warburg effect dominant metabolic phenotype observed cancers, metabolic changes adaptation occurring tumors demonstrated extend beyond Warburg effect thus considered secondary effect transformation process carcinogenesis, including nutritional deficiencies. However, role nutritional deficiencies metabolic reprogramming (e. g., oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)/glycolysis interconversion) completely known yet. Here, showed regular culture condition, proliferation U251 cells, tumor cell lines, preferentially performed Warburg effect remarkably inhibited oxamic acid inhibit activity lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); whereas serum starvation, glycolysis depressed, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enhanced, activity OXPHOS reinforced maintain cellular ATP content high level, interestingly, observed decreased expression reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, upregulated activity mitochondrial complex confirmed Western blots showed mitochondrial-related protein, NDUFA9, NDUFB8, ND1, VDAC1 remarkably increased serum starved. Mechanistically, nutritional deficiencies could reduce hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein expression increase C-MYC protein level, turn increased nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) transcription enhance activity OXPHOS, suggesting metabolic reprogramming changes microenvironment carcinogenesis provide novel therapeutic clues traditional cancer treatments.
