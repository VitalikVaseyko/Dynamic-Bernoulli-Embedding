 growing chloronema cell suspension cultures moss Funaria hygrometrica Hedw., activities several enzymes found cell-density-dependent. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (cNPDE), nitrate reductase (NR), protein kinase showed highest activity low cell density (1 2 milligrams per milliliter) indoleacetic acid (IAA) oxidase peroxidase highest high cell density (>10 milligrams per milliliter). 3'-Nucleotidase glycolytic enzymes (aldolase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, pyruvate kinase, triose phosphate isomerase) showed significant dependence cell density. Alternatively, NR peroxidase activities determined function time batch cultures, levels maximal 60 70 320 hours subculture, respectively, corresponding cell densities 1 2 23 milligrams per milliliter. relationship cell density NR peroxidase activities same, whether enzymes measured batch cultures growth cycle cells cultured different initial inoculum densities constant time. Conventionally enzymic changes correlated growth phases; however, felt pattern enzymic activities also interpreted cell-density-dependent.In moss protonema, dependence cNPDE, IAA oxidase, peroxidase cell density may play important role modulating endogenous levels IAA cAMP, regulate differentiation specific cell types (Johri Desai 1973 Nature New Biol 245: 223-224; Handa Johri 1976 Nature 259: 480-482).
