 Pyruvate kinase-deficient Escherichia coli (PB25) low by-product-producing yet fast-growing mutant shown technological potential. Determining flux limits finding extreme point flux sets previously reported identify alternate metabolite trafficking scenarios. Previously, extreme point flux sets used design tracer experiments; however, variation extracellular measurements considered, reaction reversibility assumed low moderate. study, examined utility limiting fluxes predetermining trafficking scenarios PB25, including confirmation quasi-linearity extreme points ensure sensitivity maintained. effects variation extracellular measurements reaction reversibilities also examined. Tightened flux limits reduced nonlinearity label distribution fluxes. low moderate reversibility, contrast also preserved. However, highly reversible phosphoglucoisomerase activity, information common analytes could lead flux solution biased towards one extreme point. Based PB25 model, suggestions provided predetermining flux limits trafficking scenarios could enable flux identification larger network problems.
