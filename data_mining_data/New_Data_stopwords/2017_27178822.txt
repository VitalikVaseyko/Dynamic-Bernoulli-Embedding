 Poor tumor response epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) significant challenge effective treatment head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore, strategies may increase tumor response EGFR TKIs warranted order improve HNSCC patient treatment overall survival. HNSCC tumors highly glycolytic, increased EGFR signaling found promote glucose metabolism various mechanisms. previously shown inhibition glycolysis 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) significantly enhanced antitumor effects cisplatin radiation, commonly used treat HNSCC. goal current studies determine 2DG enhance antitumor activity EGFR TKI erlotinib HNSCC. Erlotinib transiently suppressed glucose consumption accompanied alterations pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression. 2DG enhanced cytotoxic effect erlotinib vitro reversed antitumor effect erlotinib vivo. 2DG altered N-glycosylation status EGFR induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers CHOP BiP vitro. Additionally, effects 2DG + erlotinib cytotoxicity ER stress vitro reversed mannose glucose antioxidant enzymes. Lastly, protective effect 2DG erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity vivo reversed chloroquine. Altogether, 2DG suppressed antitumor efficacy erlotinib HNSCC xenograft mouse model, may due increased cytoprotective autophagy mediated ER stress activation.
