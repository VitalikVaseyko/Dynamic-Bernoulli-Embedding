 Photosynthesis, use light energy conversion CO2 inorganic nutrients plant material, ultimate source food protein necessary man's existence. Given certain assumptions, overall maximal theoretical photosynthetic efficiency agricultural plants calculated. Actual measured maximal growth rates plants equivalent efficiency levels well theoretical maximum. air, C4 plants closer theoretical value C3 plants, perhaps C4 plants avoid occurrence measurable photorespiration oxygen inhibition photosynthesis. Alfalfa, C3 legume, extremely productive protein source. protein yield per acre surpass commonly grown C4 crops (corn, sorghum) C3 seed crops (soybean, wheat, rice). Alfalfa leaf protein high nutritional quality apparently used directly human diet, eliminating protein loss involved animal production. Plant protein productivity raised part increase overall crop yield. growth plants atmospheres elevated CO2 levels result increased yields. C3 plants due, least part, suppression photorespiration oxygen inhibition photosynthesis. investigated effect CO2 concentration alfalfa photosynthetic metabolism. results support contention alfalfa productivity increased environment elevated CO2. second approach toward increased plant protein productivity regulation carbon flow photosynthesis increase portein production relative plant constituents. particular, investigated whether ammonia (the form plants first incorporate nitrogen) act regulate leaf carbon metabolism. results indicate NH4+, part stimulation pyruvate kinase, brings increased production amino acids expense sucrose production alfalfa. effect may considerable importance regulation green leaf protein synthesis.
