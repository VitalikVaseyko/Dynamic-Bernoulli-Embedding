 Differential diagnosis hemolytic anemia discussed, regard classification corpuscular extracorpuscular types hemolysis. Presence antibodies patient's serum, indicate extracorpuscular-acquired hemolytic anemia. Coombs test may positive negative according antibody present. primary disease excluded case. Abnormal hemoglobin, defect corpuscular-hereditary type. Direct laboratory enzyme estimation indicate enzyme deficiency (Glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase, Pyruvate-kinase, Glutathione-reductase). Hemoglobinelectrophoresis special tests unstable hemoglobins indicate type disturbance. defect membrane measuring osmotic fragility might helpful. Activity membrane enzymes introduction 32P fractionated membrane lipids, point special types deficient membrane. 6 cases discussed.
