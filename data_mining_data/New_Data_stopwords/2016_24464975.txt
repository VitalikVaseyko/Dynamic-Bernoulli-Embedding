 Bisphenol-A (BPA), one endocrine-disrupting chemicals, male reproductive toxicant. Previous studies revealed direct cytotoxicity BPA many cultured cells, mitotic aneuploidy embryonic cells somatic cells, apoptosis neurons testicular Sertoli cells. understand action BPA assess risk, Pten/Akt pathway investigated cultured Sertoli cells elucidate mechanism reproductive effects BPA. results showed 50 muM BPA treatment could decrease viability Sertoli cells cause apoptosis. addition, BPA could induce increase mRNA levels Pten Akt. protein level Pten increased; however, protein levels phospho-Akt procaspase-3 decreased BPA exposure. Taken together, observed results suggested Pten/Akt pathway might involved apoptotic effects BPA Sertoli cells.
