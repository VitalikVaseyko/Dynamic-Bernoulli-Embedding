 Otto Warburg first observed, cancer cells largely favor fermentative glycolysis growth even aerobic conditions. energy paradox also extends rapidly growing normal cells indicating glycolysis optimal fast growth biomass production. explored concept genetic ablation fermentative glycolysis two fast growing cancer cell lines: human colon adenocarcinoma LS174T B16 mouse melanoma. disrupted upstream glycolytic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), allow cells re-route glucose-6-phosphate flux pentose-phosphate branch. Indeed, GPI-KO severely reduced glucose consumption suppressed lactic acid secretion, reprogrammed cells rely oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial ATP production maintain viability. contrast previous pharmacological inhibition glycolysis suppressed tumor growth, GPI-KO surprisingly demonstrated moderate impact normoxic cell growth. However, hypoxic (1% O2) cell growth severely restricted. Despite vitro growth restriction hypoxia, tumor growth rates vivo reduced less 2-fold GPI-KO cancer cell lines. Combined results indicate exclusive use oxidative metabolism capacity provide metabolic precursors biomass synthesis fast growth. work others clearly indicate metabolic cancer cell plasticity poses strong limitation anticancer strategies.
