 UNLABELLED: present study, developed detailed kinetic model Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism. main model assumptions based results metabolic regulatory reconstruction system thorough model verification experimental data. development verification model included several stages, allowed us take account vitro vivo experimental data avoid ambiguity frequently occurs detailed models biochemical pathways. choice level detail mathematical description enzymatic reaction rates evaluation parameter values based available published data. Validation complete model metabolic pathway describing specific physiological states based fluxomics metabolomics data. particular, developed model describes aerobic growth E. coli continuous culture limiting concentration glucose. modification model used integrate experimental metabolomics data obtained steady-state conditions wild-type E. coli genetically modified strains, e.g. knockout pyruvate kinase gene (pykA). Following analysis model behaviour, comparison coincidence predicted experimental data, possible investigate functional regulatory properties E. coli central carbon metabolism. example, novel metabolic regulatory mechanism 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase inhibition phosphoenolpyruvate hypothesized, flux ratios reactions catalysed enzyme isoforms predicted.
