 enzymic activity mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulated phosphorylation three serine residues (sites 1, 2 3) located E1 component complex. report four isoenzymes protein kinase responsible phosphorylation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDK1, PDK2, PDK3 PDK4) differ abilities phosphorylate enzyme. PDK1 phosphorylate three sites, whereas PDK2, PDK3 PDK4 phosphorylate site 1 site 2. Although PDK2 phosphorylates site 1 2, incorporates less phosphate site 2 PDK3 PDK4. result, amount phosphate incorporated isoenzyme decreases order PDK1>PDK3>or=PDK4>PDK2. Significantly, binding coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate pyruvate dehydrogenase alters rates stoichiometries phosphorylation individual sites. First, rate phosphorylation site 1 isoenzymes kinase decreased. Secondly, thiamin pyrophosphate markedly decreases amount phosphate PDK1 incorporates sites 2 3 PDK2 incorporates site 2. contrast, coenzyme significantly affect total amount phosphate incorporated site 2 PDK3 PDK4, instead decreases rate phosphorylation site. Furthermore, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphorylated individual isoenzymes kinase reactivated different rates pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. isoenzymes phosphatase (PDP1 PDP2) readily reactivate complex phosphorylated PDK2. pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylated isoenzymes, rates reactivation decrease order PDK4>or=PDK3>PDK1. Taken together, results reported strongly suggest major determinants activity state pyruvate dehydrogenase mammalian tissues include phosphorylation site specificity isoenzymes kinase addition absolute amounts kinase phosphatase protein expressed mitochondria.
