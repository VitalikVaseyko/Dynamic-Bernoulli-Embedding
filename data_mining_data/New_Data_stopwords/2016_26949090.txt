 Gastric cancer (GC) fourth prevalent type cancer worldwide, usually caused interaction environmental genetic factors, epigenetic aspects. Referring non-coding RNAs, miR-128b reported associated many tumour cases, exerts distinct functions different types cancers. However, function miR-128b GC onset progression largely remains unknown. present study, found miR-128b expression down-regulated tissues 18 GC patients 3 carcinoma cell lines. turn, over-expression miR-128b suppressed GC cell proliferation, invasion promoted apoptosis. Moreover, miR-128b predicted bind 3'UTR PDK1 gene using bioinformatic target-screening tools. Accordingly, ectopic expression miR-128b inhibited PDK1 expression transcriptional post-transcriptional levels, furthermore, expression gene tailed 3'UTR PDK1 gene significantly decreased dualluciferase reporter assay, suggesting PDK1 direct target miR-128b GC cells. conditon miR- 128b over-expression, also observed spontaneous inactivation Akt/NF-kappaB signalling, implying PDK1 potential regulator pathway. conclusion, study shed novel light miR-128b-PDK1/Akt/NF-kappaB axis GC progression.
