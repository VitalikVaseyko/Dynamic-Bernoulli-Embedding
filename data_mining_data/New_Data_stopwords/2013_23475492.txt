 INTRODUCTION: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) characterized development progressive enlargement cysts kidneys. diagnosis ADPKD usually determined criteria renal ultrasound imaging development number cysts. However, atypical cystic disease, recognition ADPKD, DNA-based assays may required. MATERIALS METHODS: present study PCR amplified fragments PKD1 gene (covering exons 15 43- 44) genomic DNA 134 Lower Silesia patients analyzed mutations polymorphisms. Among them, clinical significance different PKD1 mutations investigated 81 persons. RESULTS: Eight new, previously undescribed, 2 recurrent mutations discovered. presence 3 known polymorphisms confirmed. Seven 8 new discovered mutations heterozygous. DISCUSSION: results present study demonstrated frequency genetic abnormalities analyzed fragments PKD1 gene Lower Silesian population smaller previously reported. Moreover, could detect deletions insertions, often present regions PKD1 gene, may due limited number screened patients. conclude none discovered changes PKD1 gene effect clinical phenotype disease.
