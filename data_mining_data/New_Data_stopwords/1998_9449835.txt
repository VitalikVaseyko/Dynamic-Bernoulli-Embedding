 Previously, reported transformation tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) vector containing potato cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) cDNA generated two plant lines specifically lacking leaf PKc (PKc-) result co-suppression. PKc deficiency primary transformants appear alter plant development, although root growth examined. report striking reduction root growth homozygous progeny PKc- lines throughout development moderate (600 microE m-2 s-1) low (100 microE m-2 s-1) light intensities. PKc- lines cultivated low light, shoot flower development also delayed leaf indentations apparent. Leaf PK activity transformants significantly decreased time points examined, whereas root activities unaffected. Polypeptides corresponding PKc undetectable immunoblots PKc- leaf extracts, except 6-week-old low-light-grown PKc- plants, leaf PKc expression appeared greatly reduced. metabolic implications kinetic characteristics partially purified PKc wild-type tobacco leaves discussed. Overall, results suggest leaf PKc deficiency leads perturbation source-sink relationships.
