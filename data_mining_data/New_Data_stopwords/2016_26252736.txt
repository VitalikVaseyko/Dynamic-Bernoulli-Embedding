 O-GlcNAcylation dynamic post-translational modification extensive crosstalk phosphorylation either adjacent sites various proteins. previously reported O-GlcNAcylation level increased primary breast colorectal cancer, interplay two modifications remains unclear. Therefore, explored crosstalk modifications RNA interference O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) colorectal cancer cells. Two-dimensional immunoblotting mass spectrometric analysis showed levels O-GlcNAc serine phosphorylation many proteins including serine hydroxymethyltransferase, cytokeratin-8, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L, lamin-B1, reduced siOGT cells compared siScramble cells. HT29 cells, immunoprecipitated PKM2 revealed decreased O-GlcNAc serine phosphorylation levels siOGT knockdown, increased levels treatment Thiamet-G, inhibitor O-GlcNAcase (OGA). addition, global O-GlcNAcylation enhanced treating cells Thiamet-G, PKM2 expression level upregulated, PKM2-specific activity decreased. hand, OGT knockdown cells, PKM2 expression level downregulated, PKM2-specific activity increased. Moreover, metastatic colorectal cancer cells, SW620, O-GlcNAc-PKM2 showed lower PKM2-specific activity compared non-metastatic colorectal cancer SW480 cells. results suggested roles O-GlcNAcylation modulating serine phosphorylation, well regulating PKM2 activity expression. Interfering levels O-GlcNAcylation PKM2 may novel target controlling cancer metabolism tumorigenesis colorectal cancer.
