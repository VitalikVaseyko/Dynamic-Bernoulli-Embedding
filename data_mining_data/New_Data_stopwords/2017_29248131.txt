 Glucose key metabolite used cancer cells generate ATP, maintain redox state create biomass. Glucose catabolized lactate cytoplasm, termed glycolysis, alternatively catabolized carbon dioxide water mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic heterogeneity exists subset human tumors, cells maintaining glycolytic phenotype others predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation. Cells within tumors interact metabolically transfer catabolites supporting stromal cells adjacent cancer cells. Reverse Warburg Effect describes glycolysis cancer-associated stroma metabolically supports adjacent cancer cells. catabolite transfer, induces stromal-cancer metabolic coupling, allows cancer cells generate ATP, increase proliferation, reduce cell death. Catabolites implicated metabolic coupling include monocarboxylates lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) critically necessary release uptake catabolites. MCT4 involved release monocarboxylates cells, regulated catabolic transcription factors hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated B cells (NF-kappaB), highly expressed cancer-associated fibroblasts. Conversely, MCT1 predominantly involved uptake catabolites highly expressed subgroup cancer cells. MYC TIGAR, genes involved cellular proliferation anabolism, inducers MCT1. Profiling human tumors basis altered redox balance intra-tumoral metabolic interactions may important biomarker therapeutic implications. Alterations redox state mitochondrial function cells induce metabolic coupling. Hence, interest redox metabolic modulators anticancer agents. Also, markers metabolic coupling associated poor outcomes numerous human malignancies may useful prognostic predictive biomarkers.
