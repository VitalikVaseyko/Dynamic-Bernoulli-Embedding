 extension life span caloric restriction studied across species yeast Caenorhabditis elegans primates. generally accepted theory proposed explain observations. Here, propose life span extension produced caloric restriction duplicated metabolic changes induced ketosis. nematodes mice, extension life span results decreased signaling insulin/insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling (IIS) pathway. Decreased IIS diminishes phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate (PIP3 ) production, leading reduced PI3K AKT kinase activity decreased forkhead box transcription factor (FOXO) phosphorylation, allowing FOXO proteins remain nucleus. nucleus, FOXO proteins increase transcription genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase 2, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, hundreds genes. effective method combating free radical damage occurs metabolism ketone bodies, ketosis characteristic physiological change brought caloric restriction fruit flies primates. dietary ketone ester also decreases circulating glucose insulin leading decreased IIS. ketone body, d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (d-betaHB), natural inhibitor class IIa histone deacetylases repress transcription FOXO3a gene. Therefore, ketosis results transcription enzymes antioxidant pathways. addition, metabolism ketone bodies results negative redox potential NADP antioxidant system, terminal destructor oxygen free radicals. Addition d-betaHB cultures C. elegans extends life span. hypothesize increasing levels ketone bodies also extend life span humans calorie restriction extends life span least part increasing levels ketone bodies. exogenous ketone ester provides new tool mimicking effects caloric restriction used future research. ability power mitochondria aged individuals limited ability oxidize glucose metabolites due pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition suggests new lines research preventative measures treatments aging aging-related disorders.
