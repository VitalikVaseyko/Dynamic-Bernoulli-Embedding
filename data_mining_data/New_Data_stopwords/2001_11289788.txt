 previous study, Escherichia coli strain lacking key enzymes (acetate kinase phosphotransacetylase, ACK-PTA) major acetate synthesis pathways reduced acetate accumulation. ackA-pta mutant strain also exhibits increased lactate synthesis rate. Metabolic flux analysis suggested majority excessive carbon flux redirected lactate formation pathway rather ethanol synthesis pathway. result indicated lactate dehydrogenase may competitive pyruvate node. However, 10-fold overexpression fermentative lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) gene wild-type parent GJT001 able divert carbon flux acetate. carbon flux pyruvate end products increases expense flux biosynthesis succinate. Intracellular pyruvate measurements showed strains overexpressing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) depleted pyruvate pool. observation along observed excretion pyruvate ackA-pta strain indicates significance intracellular pyruvate pools. current study, focus role intracellular pyruvate pool redirection metabolic fluxes important node. increasing level extracellular pyruvate leads increase intracellular pyruvate pool. increase intracellular pyruvate affects carbon flux distribution pyruvate node. Partitioning carbon flux acetate expense ethanol occurs acetyl-CoA node partitioning pyruvate node favors lactate formation. increased competitiveness lactate pathway may due allosteric activation LDH result increased pyruvate levels. interaction reactions catalyzed enzymes PFL (pyruvate formate lyase) LDH examined.
