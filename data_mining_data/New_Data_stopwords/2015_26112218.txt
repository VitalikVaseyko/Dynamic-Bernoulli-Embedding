 Despite wide use first-line therapeutic agent, gemcitabine shown limited efficacy advanced pancreatic cancer due chemoresistance yet unidentified mechanisms. goal identify molecular features involved gemcitabine chemoresistance. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), key enzyme aerobic glycolysis, recently emerged important therapeutic target cancer treatment. involved metabolic reprogramming cancer cells previously unexpected non-metabolic functions heavily involved tumor growth survival. Herein, report chemoresistance pancreatic cancer gemcitabine dependent PKM2 expression non-metabolic function. Knocking-down PKM2 significantly enhanced gemcitabine-induced cell apoptosis activation caspase 3/7 PARP cleavage, inhibitory activity associated p38-mediated activation p53 phosphorylation serine 46. findings support potential PKM2 novel target gemcitabine chemoresistance suggest feasibility combining gemcitabine PKM2 inhibition improved chemotherapy pancreatic cancer.
