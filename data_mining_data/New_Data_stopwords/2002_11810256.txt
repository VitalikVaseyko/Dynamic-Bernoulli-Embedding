 Congenic lines differ single defined chromosome segment useful study complex phenotypes, allow isolation effect particular quantitative trait locus (QTL) entire genome. conducted high-resolution QTL mapping 9-cM introgression, originating wild tomato species Lycopersicon pennellii, two extremely different genetic physiological backgrounds. "indeterminate" glasshouse background identified single QTL ( Brix9-2-5) affects total soluble solids fruit [mainly sugars, measured Brix units (B)]. QTL previously delimited within gene apoplastic invertase, Lin5, modulates sugar partitioning fruit. Analysis effects chromosome segment "determinate", open-field tomatoes, revealed two QTLs, 0.3 cM apart: fruit-specific Brix9-2-5 affects B only, shoot-specific PW9-2-5, accounts altered growth habit resulting increases plant weight, yield, B. study highlights power congenic approach dissecting developmental pathways leading complex phenotypes.
