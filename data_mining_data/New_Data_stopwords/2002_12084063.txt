 synthesis 10 new phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) analogues modifications phosphate carboxylate function described. Included two potential irreversible inhibitors PEP-utilizing enzymes. One incorporates reactive chloromethylphosphonate function replacing phosphate group PEP. second contains chloromethyl group substituting carboxylate function PEP. improved procedure preparation known (Z)- (E)-3-chloro-PEP also given. isomers obtained 4 : 1 mixture, resolved anion-exchange chromatography last reaction step. stereochemistry two isomers unequivocally assigned (3)J(H-C) coupling constants carboxylate carbons vinyl protons. known PEP-analogues tested reversible irreversible inhibitors Mg2+- Mn2+- activated PEP-utilizing enzymes: enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), pyruvate kinase, PEP carboxylase enolase. Without exception, potent inhibitors substitution vinyl proton. Modification phosphate carboxylate groups resulted less effective compounds. Enzyme least tolerant modifications. Among carboxylate-modified analogues, replaced negatively charged group inhibited pyruvate kinase enolase. Remarkably, activity PEP carboxylase stimulated derivatives neutral groups position presence Mg2+, Mn2+. irreversible inhibition enzymes, (Z)-3-Cl-PEP found fast-acting efficient suicide inhibitor enzyme (t(1/2) = 0.7 min).
