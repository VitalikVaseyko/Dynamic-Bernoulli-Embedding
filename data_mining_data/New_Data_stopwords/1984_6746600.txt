 partial chromatographic purification rat liver cell sap DEAE-cellulose, including removal type M2 pyruvate kinase, different forms type L pyruvate kinase separated chromatofocusing. Three fractions pyruvate kinase activity found, eluting pH 5.0, 5.2, 5.3, respectively. first one identified phosphorylated second one unphosphorylated pyruvate kinase. strong indications third fraction represented proteolytically modified form enzyme, since co-migrated form modified vitro similarly increased apparent Km phosphoenolpyruvate. rule possibility phosphorylated form pyruvate kinase, enzyme incubated phosphoprotein phosphatase phosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase. enzyme phosphorylated, like pyruvate kinase modified subtilisin calcium-activated protease. evidence proteolytically modified pyruvate kinase exists vivo. enzyme form previously demonstrated cell sap, prior exposure proteolytic enzymes. relative amounts three forms determined livers starved rats rats fed normal carbohydrate-rich diet.
