 Hereditary red blood cell enzymopathies genetic disorders affecting genes encoding red blood cell enzymes. cause specific type anemia designated hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA). Enzymopathies affect cellular metabolism, which, red cell, mainly consists anaerobic glycolysis, hexose monophosphate shunt, glutathione metabolism, nucleotide metabolism. Enzymopathies commonly associated normocytic normochromic hemolytic anemia. contrast hereditary red cell disorders membrane disorders hemoglobinopathies, morphology red blood cell shows specific abnormalities. Diagnosis based detection reduced specific enzyme activity molecular characterization defect DNA level. common enzyme disorders deficiencies glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) pyruvate kinase (PK). However, number enzyme disorders, often much less known, causing HNSHA. disorders rare often underdiagnosed, purpose review. brief review, provide overview clinically relevant enzymes, function red cell metabolism, key aspects laboratory diagnosis.
