 Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) play critical roles regulation cellular energy metabolism response inducible coactivators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha). yeast two-hybrid screen led identification cytokine-stimulated transcriptional regulator, Bcl3, ERRalpha coactivator. Bcl3 shown synergize PGC-1alpha coactivate ERRalpha. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated ERRalpha, PGC-1alpha, Bcl3 form complex ERRalpha-responsive element within pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene promoter cardiac myocytes. Mapping studies demonstrated Bc13 interacts PGC-1alpha ERRalpha, allowing interaction proteins. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated Bcl3 activates genes involved diverse pathways including subset involved cellular energy metabolism known regulated PGC-1alpha, ERRalpha, second nuclear receptor, PPARalpha. Consistent gene expression profiling results, Bcl3 shown synergistically coactivate PPARalpha PGC-1alpha manner similar ERRalpha. propose cooperativity Bcl3 PGC-1alpha may serve point convergence nuclear receptor targets direct programs orchestrating inflammatory energy metabolism responses heart tissues.
