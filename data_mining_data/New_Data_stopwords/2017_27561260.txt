 Brucellosis, caused facultative intracellular pathogen Brucella, one prevalent zoonosis worldwide. Host infection relies several uncanonical virulence factors. recent research hotpot links carbon metabolism bacterial virulence. study, found carbon metabolism-related pyruvate kinase (Pyk) encoded pyk gene (locus tag BAB_RS24320) associated Brucella virulence. Determination bacterial growth curves resistance environmental stress factors showed Pyk plays important role B. abortus growth, especially conditions nutrition deprivation, resistance oxidative stress. Additionally, cell infection assay showed Pyk necessary B. abortus survival evading fusion lysosomes within RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, animal experiments exhibited Pyk deletion significantly reduced B. abortus virulence mouse infection model. results elucidated role Pyk B. abortus virulence provided information investigation Brucella virulence associated carbon metabolism.
