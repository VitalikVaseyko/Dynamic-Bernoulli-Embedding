 Glycolytic activity five brain areas rat studied two hypothyroid states: (1) induced low-iodine diet weaning, (2) induced propylthiouracil. areas studied anterior cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, septum hippocampus. low-iodine diet induced decrease pyruvate kinase activity three region phosphofructokinase hippocampus, hexokinase increased amygdala septum. Propylthiouracil treatment produced increase hexokinase activity hypothalamus septum, decrease anterior cortex, phosphofructokinase decreased significantly hippocampus. significant changes lactate dehydrogenase activity observed. correlation results type hypothyroidism discussed.
