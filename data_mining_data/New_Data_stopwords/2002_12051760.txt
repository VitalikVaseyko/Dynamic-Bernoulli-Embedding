 VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) receptor peripheral lipoprotein receptor expressing fatty acid active tissues abundantly. Balb/c fasting mice, VLDL receptor well LPL (lipoprotein lipase), FAT (fatty acid translocase)/CD36, H-FABP (heart-type fatty acid-binding protein), ACS (acyl-CoA synthetase) LCAD (long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) expressions increased. electron microscopic examination indicated lipid droplets accumulated hearts fasting Balb/c mice. development SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats, VLDL receptor, LPL, FAT/CD36, H-FABP, ACS, LCAD mRNAs concomitantly increased growth. However, PK (pyruvate kinase) mRNA expression negligible. cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, VLDL receptor expression increased days culture. Oil red-O staining showed cardiomyocytes 7 days culture (when VLDL receptor protein present) accumulated beta-migrating VLDL. Thereby, showed cardiac VLDL receptor pathway delivery remnant lipoprotein particles might part cardiac fatty acid metabolism.
