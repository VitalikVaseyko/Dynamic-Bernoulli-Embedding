 Key enzymes related lipogenesis liver induced high glucose diet insulin suppressed starvation, diabetes, glucagon. enzymes also induced dietary fructose, even diabetic liver. regulation occurs posttranscriptional level well transcriptional level. studied extensively molecular mechanism induction L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK). transcription LPK gene liver stimulated insulin inhibited glucagon. insulin action required ongoing protein synthesis metabolism glucose enhanced glucocorticoid. hand, mechanism induction LPK dietary fructose depended plasma insulin levels. Dietary fructose stimulated transcription LPK gene normal rats, whereas acted mainly posttranscriptional level diabetic rats. fructose effects attributable common metabolite fructose glycerol. induction LPK mRNA dietary glucose impaired liver Wistar fatty rats, model obese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, fructose-induced accumulation mRNA not. Studies transgenic mice indicated 5'-flanking region -3 kb LPK gene contained cis-acting elements necessary tissue-specific expression LPK stimulation diets insulin. analysis using transient expression assay revealed presence three cis-acting elements necessary expression LPK hepatocytes region -170 kb. However, elements alone sufficient dietary hormonal regulation enzyme analyzed transgenic mice.
