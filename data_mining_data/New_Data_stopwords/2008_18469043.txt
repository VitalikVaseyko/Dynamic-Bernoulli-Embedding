 determine effects ammonia load glucose metabolism ruminant small intestinal tissues, duodenal mucosal cells (DMC) isolated growing female sheep (n = 10; 46. 0 +/- 0. 8 kg BW) fed diets differing CP content: high (19. 4%) vs. low (13. 1%). Ammonia concentration duodenal digesta fluid greater sheep fed high CP diet compared fed low CP diet (16. 4 +/- 1. 0 vs. 9. 1 +/- 1. 8 mM). isolated primary mucosal cells incubated 90 min [2-(13)C] glucose (3 mM) ammonium chloride (0, 0. 1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 mM) Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer. hypothesized DMC would increase glucose carbon utilization synthesis nonessential AA ammonia concentration incubation media increased. However, utilization glucose carbon alanine synthesis decreased linearly (P = 0. 03) ammonia concentration incubation media increased. Furthermore, glucose disappearance utilization glucose carbon aspartate synthesis affected (P > 0. 47) ammonia concentration. Contrarily, vitro glucose disappearance greater (P = 0. 03) DMC isolated sheep fed low CP diet vs. high CP diet [14. 6 +/- 1. 6 vs. 8. 6 +/- 1. 3 nmol.(10(6) cells)(-1).(90 min) (-1)], hexokinase activity greater (P = 0. 01) mucosa sheep fed low CP diet compared high CP diet (1. 22 +/- 0. 05 vs. 1. 04 +/- 0. 02 mUnit/mg protein). observations indicate ammonia load affect extent glucose utilization DMC, glucose carbon may play significant role synthesis alanine, aspartate, glutamate DMC exposed increased concentrations ammonia.
