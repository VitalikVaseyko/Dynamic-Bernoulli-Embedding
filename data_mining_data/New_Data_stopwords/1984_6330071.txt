 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase rat liver phosphorylated cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase [gamma-32P]ATP. Treatment 32P-labeled enzyme thermolysin removed radioactivity enzyme core produced single labeled peptide. phosphopeptide purified ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. sequence 12-amino acid peptide found Val-Leu-Gln-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ser(P)-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln. Correlation extent phosphorylation activity showed 50% decrease ratio kinase activity bisphosphate activity occurred 0.25 mol phosphate incorporated per mol enzyme subunit, maximal changes occurred 0.7 mol incorporated. kinetics cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation native bifunctional enzyme compared rat liver protein substrates. Km 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase (10 microM) less rat liver pyruvate kinase (39 microM), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (222 microM), 6- phosphofructose -1-kinase (230 microM). Comparison initial rate phosphorylation number protein substrates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase revealed skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase phosphorylated rapidly bifunctional enzyme. Skeletal muscle glycogen synthase, heart regulatory subunit cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, liver pyruvate kinase phosphorylated rates nearly equal 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase, phosphorylation fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase barely detectable. Phosphorylation 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase catalyzed protein kinase tested. results consistent primary role cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase regulation enzyme intact liver.
