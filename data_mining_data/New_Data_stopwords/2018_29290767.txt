 Increasing evidences indicate shikonin suppress tumor growth. However, mechanisms remain elusive. present study, investigated effects mechanisms shikonin esophageal cancer. expression hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) esophageal cancer tissues cells detected immunohistochemistry Western blot. CCK-8 used examine esophageal cancer cell viability. Apoptosis cell cycle analyzed flow cytometry. expression EGFR, PI3K, Akt, p-AKT, mTOR, HIF1alpha PKM2 detected Western blot. EC109/pkm2 established lentivirus transducer. Ec109 tumor model founded observe antitumor effect shikonin vivo. found HIF1alpha PKM2 protein expression levels higher esophageal cancer tissues cells normal esophageal tissues cells. Shikonin reduced esophageal cancer cells viability induced cell cycle arrest apoptosis. Shikonin decreased EGFR, PI3K, p-AKT, HIF1alpha PKM2 expression. Overexpression PKM2 could enhance resistance esophageal cancer cells shikonin. vivo found shikonin reduced tumor burden, inducing cell arrest apoptosis. Taken together, shikonin significant antitumor effect esophageal cancer regulating HIF1alpha/PKM2 signal pathway.
