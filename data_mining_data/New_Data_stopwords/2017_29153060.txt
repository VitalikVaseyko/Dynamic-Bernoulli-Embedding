 OBJECTIVES: explore whether metabolic switches proceed succeed histological changes precancerous lesions. validate pyruvate kinase isoform 1 (PKM1) pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2) histological biomarker predict progression endometrial hyperplasia invasive cancer status. METHODS: records 56 patients primary diagnosis complex hyperplasia atypia endometrial biopsy selected analyzed retrospectively. set 3 consecutive sections 4-mum thickness cut studied immunohistochemical stains. case, 2 3 fields diagnosis complex hyperplasia atypia selected compared. single pathologist blinded final diagnosis assigned scoring. RESULTS: Positive immunostaining PKM1 observed 31.25% (10 32) initial endometrial biopsy diagnosis complex hyperplasia atypia final diagnosis endometrial cancer, 91.67% (out 24) patients final diagnosis negative endometrial cancer endometrial biopsy positive PKM1 staining ( P < .001). Positive immunostaining PKM2 observed 100% patient endometrial biopsy result endometrial hyperplasia atypia (56 56). CONCLUSIONS: Lack staining PKM1 expression may help predict fate endometrial hyperplasia. disappearance marker associated progression hyperplasia toward cancer phenotype. studies needed understand causes potential mechanisms suppressing Pyruvate Kinase Isoform 1 expression endometrial hyperplasia.
