 Smad interacting protein 1 (SIP1) plays important role epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process downregulating E-cadherin. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) crucial enzyme plays important role final step Warburg effect converting pyruvate lactate irreversibly. EMT Warburg effect hallmarks advanced gastric cancer progression. Recently, EMT thought implicated cancer metabolism. study, want find whether correlation expressions SIP1 LDHA gastric cancer whether expression SIP1 alone combination LDHA associated progression gastric cancer. present study, examined SIP1 LDHA expression immunohistochemistry analysis tissue microarray (TMA) containing tumor tissues matched non-neoplastic mucosa (NNM). Prognostic value correlation clinicopathologic factors evaluated. study, investigated expression SIP1 LDHA 261 cancer tissues matched NNM using tissue microarray. immunohistochemistry analysis showed expression SIP1 LDHA significantly higher cancer tissues NNM (P = 0.002 P = 0.000, respectively). expression SIP1was significantly associated age, Lauren grade, histologic differentiation (P < 0.05). expression SIP1 strongly correlated LDHA expression gastric cancer (P = 0.000, R = 0.589). combined expression SIP1 LDHA significantly associated age, Lauren grade, histologic differentiation (P < 0.05). Survival analysis demonstrated expression SIP1 LDHA associated significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.003, P = 0.000, respectively) disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.003, P = 0.000, respectively). combined expression SIP1 LDHA associated less survival time gastric cancer patients (P = 0.000). multivariate analysis showed expressions SIP1 LDHA gastric cancer (GC) independent prognostic factors OS (hazard ratio = 1.465, 95 %CI 1.128-1.901, P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 1.514, 95 %CI 1.091-2.101 P = 0.013, respectively) DFS (hazard ratio = 1.461, 95 %CI 1.130-1.890, P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 1.550 95 %CL1.119-2.147 P = 0.008, respectively). study indicated expressions SIP1 LDHA independent prognostic factors gastric cancer patients may predictive poor outcomes.
