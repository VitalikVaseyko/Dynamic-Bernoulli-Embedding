 BACKGROUND AIMS: Although active inflammatory changes chronic Crohn's disease (CD) detected serum inflammatory markers, low specificity sensitivity. Stool markers inflammation, M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), permit direct assessment mucosal inflammation. aim study assess levels M2-PK children active CD compare levels healthy control children. METHODS: Fecal levels M2-PK measured immunoassay using stored stool samples children untreated (active) CD healthy control children. Correlations M2-PK levels disease activity scores serum inflammatory markers performed. Comparison also made M2PK second fecal inflammatory marker, S100A12. RESULTS: Mean fecal M2-PK levels higher 17 patients active CD 21 healthy controls (p = 0.0007). M2-PK levels correlate disease activity scores serum inflammatory markers. trend children ileocolonic disease higher levels M2-PK stool compared colonic disease isolated ileal disease. Fecal M2PK correlate fecal S100A12 children active CD. CONCLUSION: Fecal M2-PK increased children active CD, indicating marker may useful non-invasive marker gut inflammation. studies M2PK required additional settings larger cohorts children CD comparison stool markers.
