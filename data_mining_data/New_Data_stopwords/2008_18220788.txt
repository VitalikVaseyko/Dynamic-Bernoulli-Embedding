 Diabetes mellitus chronic metabolic disorder, characterized glucose overproduction glucose underutilization. Current therapy T2DM includes drugs, like metformin, glitazones, sulphonyl ureas, etc. Extensive research carried world wide molecular targets T2DM like PPARgamma, PTP1B, DPP-IV, GSK-3, cannabinoid receptor, fructose-bisphosphatases, beta3 adrenoceptor, etc. development newer anti-diabetic agents. therapeutic targets quite important suitable silico analysis. Hence, many molecular modeling informatics studies like, molecular docking, pharmacophore mapping, 3D-QSAR, virtual screening, quantum chemical studies, pharmacoinformatics like bioinformatics chemoinformatics studies performed drugs/leads/targets associated T2DM. Several silico efforts exemplary studies; methodologies adopted studies emulated many therapeutic areas. review rational approaches reported designing anti-diabetic agents presented article.
