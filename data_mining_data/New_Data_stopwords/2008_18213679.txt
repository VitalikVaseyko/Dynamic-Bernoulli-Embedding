 cAMP-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation flagellar hyperactivation controlled via complicated signaling cascades mammalian spermatozoa. instance, events seem regulated positively PKA-mediated signaling negatively PI3K/PDK1-mediated signaling. article, shown molecular changes PKA PDK1 cAMP analog (cBiMPS)-treated boar spermatozoa order disclose possible roles kinases protein tyrosine phosphorylation hyperactivation. Ejaculated spermatozoa incubated cBiMPS, used biochemical analyses sperm kinases Western blotting indirect immunofluorescence assessment flagellar movement. first 30-min incubation cBiMPS highly activated PKA principal piece accompaniment autophosphorylation Thr-197 catalytic subunits. However, protein tyrosine phosphorylation hyperactivation fully induced sperm samples 180-min incubation. potentially active form PDK1 (54/55-kDa phospho-PDK1) detected principal piece spermatozoa 90-min incubation. Another potentially active form (59-kDa phospho-PDK1) gradually increased incubation period. However, PDK1 suddenly became inactive dephosphorylation 180-min incubation, namely coincidently full induction protein tyrosine phosphorylation hyperactivation. Additionally, existence PI3K-dependently suppressing mechanisms protein tyrosine phosphorylation confirmed principal piece pharmacological experiments LY294002 biochemical analyses anti-PI3K p85 antibodies. findings suggest dephosphorylation PDK1 may molecular switch enhancement protein tyrosine phosphorylation flagellar hyperactivation boar spermatozoa.
