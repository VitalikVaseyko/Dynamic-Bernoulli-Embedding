 child chronic hemolytic anemia since birth found erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) highly unusual form relative mutant isozymes characterized International Committee Standardization Hematology criteria. properties partially purified isozyme (designated PK-Greenville) altered minimally, all, except nearly total insensitivity allosteric activation fructose-1,6-diphosphate (F-1,6-P). One parent appeared heterozygous null gene allele governing production mutant isozyme. Apparent restriction molecular defect ineffective activation kinetics suggests F-1,6-P binding site erythrocyte PK functionally well physically allosteric. magnitude metabolic block PK step clinical severity indicate allosteric modulation F-1,6-P crucial property PK normal erythrocyte metabolism.
