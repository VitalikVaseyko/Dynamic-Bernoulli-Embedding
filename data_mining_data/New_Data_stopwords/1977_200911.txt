 Synthetic polypeptides employed substrates kinetic analyses reaction mechanism catalytic subunit cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) calf thymus. enzyme preparation shown catalyze transfer phosphate ATP histone H1 calf thymus, well two synthetic polypeptides, Arg-Lys-Ala-Ser-Gly-Pro (H1-6) Arg-Arg-Lys-Ala-Ser-Gly-Pro (H1-7), corresponding amino acid sequence serine-38 calf H1. related, basic heptapeptide corresponding sequence pig liver pyruvate kinase, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (K), also substrate. stoichiometry peptide phosphorylation established case transfer 1 mol phosphate gamma position MgATP serine hydroxyl 1 mol peptide. Steady-state, initial-velocity, kinetic parameters determined substrate, using various concentrations ATP. conditions used, synthetic peptides reacted greater maximum velocities whole histone H1. Nevertheless, K(m) H1, 54 muM, lower K(m) values synthetic substrates. efficient substrate peptide K, V(max) 50.6 mumol/min per mg kinase K(m) 63 muM. absence peptide substrate ATPase activity detectable sensitivity 0.05% rate peptide phosphorylation, suggesting ATP cleaved form unstable phosphoenzyme complex. data consistent sequential reaction mechanism involving ternary complex enzyme, polypeptide substrate, ATP.
