 Dextran M20 added isolated rat liver mitochondria mimic cytosolic macromolecules. conditions, morphological changes mitochondrial periphery occur upon isolation organelle restored, i.e. volume intermembrane space decreases contact site frequency increases. ADP routing mitochondrial kinases various locations investigated using activities oxidative phosphorylation externally added pyruvate kinase sensors ADP transport matrix extramitochondrial compartment, respectively. studies reveal significant fraction ADP generated either adenylate kinase intermembrane space outer membrane bound hexokinase isozyme I, accessible extramitochondrial pyruvate kinase. Quantitative information ADP compartmentation rat liver mitochondria obtained comparing ADP supply mitochondrial kinases oxidative phosphorylation non-bound, extramitochondrially located kinases. approach allowed us estimate ADP diffusion gradients present across outer membrane compartment formed bound hexokinase extramitochondrial compartment. presence 10% dextran M20 ADP gradients amounted approximately 12 microM. possible role mitochondrial kinases ADP transport mitochondria vivo discussed.
