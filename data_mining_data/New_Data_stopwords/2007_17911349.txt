 mathematical model perfused rat liver developed predict intermediate metabolite concentrations fluxes response changes various substrate concentrations perfusion medium. model simulates gluconeogenesis liver perfused separately lactate pyruvate combination substrates fatty acids (oleate). model consists key reactions representing gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, ketogenesis. Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic expressions, control ATP/ADP, used many reactions. key regulated reactions (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate kinase), rate expressions developed incorporate allosteric effectors, specific substrate relationships (e.g., cooperative binding), and/or phosphorylation/dephosphorylation using vitro enzyme activity data knowledge specific mechanisms. model independently validated comparing model predictions 10 sets experimental data 7 different published works, parameter adjustments. simulations predict trends, terms stimulation substrate uptake fatty acid addition, observed experimentally. general, major metabolic indicators calculated model good agreement experimental results. example, simulated glucose/pyruvate mass yield 43% compared average 45% reported literature. model accurately predicts specific time constants glucose response (2.5-4 min) dynamic behavior substrate product fluxes. expected model useful tool analyzing complex relationships carbohydrate fat metabolism.
