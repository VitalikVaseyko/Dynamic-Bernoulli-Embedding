 BNip3 hypoxia-inducible protein targets mitochondria autophagosomal degradation. report novel tumor suppressor role BNip3 clinically relevant mouse model mammary tumorigenesis. BNip3 delays primary mammary tumor growth progression preventing accumulation dysfunctional mitochondria resultant excess ROS production. absence BNip3, mammary tumor cells unable reduce mitochondrial mass effectively elevated mitochondrial ROS increases expression Hif-1alpha Hif target genes, including involved glycolysis angiogenesis-two processes also markedly increased BNip3-null tumors. Glycolysis inhibition attenuates growth BNip3-null tumor cells, revealing increased dependence autophagy survival. also demonstrate BNIP3 deletion used prognostic marker tumor progression metastasis human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). studies show mitochondrial dysfunction-caused defects mitophagy-can promote Warburg effect tumor progression, suggest better approaches stratifying TNBC treatment.
