 Spirulina platensis (SP) microalga antioxidant, antidiabetic anti-inflammatory properties. present study explored ability potential mechanism(s) SP induced glucose lowering impact diabetic rat model. Forty rats allocated four groups: control; streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes (STZ, 45mg/kg b.w., intraperitoneally); SP (500mg/kg b.w., orally twice weekly 2 months) STZ-induced diabetes+SP group. STZ-induced diabetic rats, SP significantly decreased (P>0.05) serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels significantly increased (P>0.05) serum insulin, activity antioxidant enzymes normalized mRNA gene expression. Furthermore, SP attenuates STZ-induced upregulation gluconeogenic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC), pro-apoptotic Bax caspase-3 (CASP-3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression. Western blot results revealed that, SP induced downregulation mitogen activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) protein expression hepatic tissues diabetic rats. Additionally, SP reestablished typical histological structure liver pancreas diabetic rats. Acute toxicity study shows SP relatively safe. study demonstrates SP rich antioxidant compounds powerful glucose lowering effect normalization increased hepatic PC gene expression. Interestingly, SP induced recovery damaged hepatocytes pancreatic beta-cells via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant anti-apoptotic properties. MAPK signaling cascade pivotal component proapoptotic signaling pathway induced diabetes mellitus. MAPK activation may dependent ROS production, since SP exhibited antioxidant activities significant impact MAPK activity.
