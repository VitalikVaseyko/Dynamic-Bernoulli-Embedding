 Pyruvate obligatory intermediate oxidative disposal glucose major precursor synthesis glucose, glycerol, fatty acids, non-essential amino acids. Stringent control fate pyruvate critically important cellular homeostasis. regulatory mechanisms metabolism therefore great interest. Recent advances include findings (a) mitochondrial pyruvate carrier sensitive inhibition thiazolidinediones; (b) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases induce Warburg effect many disease states; (c) pyruvate carboxylase important determinate rates gluconeogenesis humans type 2 diabetes. enzymes potential therapeutic targets several diseases.
