 pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) expressed cancer plays role regulating anabolic metabolism. determine whether PKM2 required tumor formation growth, generated mice conditional allele abolishes PKM2 expression without disrupting PKM1 expression. PKM2 deletion accelerated mammary tumor formation Brca1-loss-driven model breast cancer. PKM2 null tumors displayed heterogeneous PKM1 expression, PKM1 found nonproliferating tumor cells detectable pyruvate kinase expression proliferating cells. suggests PKM2 necessary tumor cell proliferation implies inactive state PKM2 associated proliferating cell population within tumors, whereas nonproliferating tumor cells require active pyruvate kinase. Consistent findings, variable PKM2 expression heterozygous PKM2 mutations found human tumors. data suggest regulation PKM2 activity supports different metabolic requirements proliferating nonproliferating tumor cells.
