 poor prognosis glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) mainly attributed drug resistance mechanisms existence subpopulation glioma stem cells (GSCs). Multitarget compounds able affect different deregulated pathways GSC subpopulation could escape tumor resistance and, importantly, eradicate stem cell reservoir. respect, simultaneous inhibition phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) aurora kinase (AurA), one playing pivotal role cellular survival/migration/differentiation, could represent innovative strategy overcome GBM resistance recurrence. Herein, cross-talk pathways investigated, using single-target reference compounds MP7 (PDK1 inhibitor) Alisertib (AurA inhibitor). Furthermore, new ligand, SA16, identified ability inhibit PDK1 AurA pathways once, thus proving useful tool simultaneous inhibition two kinases. SA16 blocked GBM cell proliferation, reduced tumor invasiveness, triggered cellular apoptosis. importantly, AurA/PDK1 blocker showed increased efficacy GSCs, inducing differentiation apoptosis. best knowledge, first report combined targeting PDK1 AurA. drug represents attractive multitarget lead scaffold development new potential treatments GBM GSCs.
