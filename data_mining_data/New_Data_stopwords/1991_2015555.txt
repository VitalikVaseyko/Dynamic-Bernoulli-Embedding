 Pyruvate kinase (PK) studied 57 fibroblastic fibrohistiocytic proliferations normal fibrous tissue (n = 10). specific activity significantly increased malignant tumors (1.67 +/- 0.25) compared normal tissue (0.26 +/- 0.04; P less 0.001) benign proliferations (0.52 +/- 0.05; P less 0.005). Although overlap exists aggressive fibromatosis benign group, high values PK activity indicative Grade 2 3 malignancy. Significant shifts isozyme pattern, favoring expression K-type subunits found tumors metastasizing potential aggressive fibromatosis. changes isozyme pattern PK aggressive fibromatosis may act another argument place category malignant fibroblastic tumors.
