 part ongoing search diabetes susceptibility loci, tested linkage non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) 19 candidate loci regions chosen potential affect directly indirectly action insulin. Loci associated insulin resistance, known effects lipid metabolism, effects glucose metabolism insulin action. Loci included insulin-responsive (GLUT4) glucose transporter, hexokinase 2, glucagon, growth hormone, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, hepatic muscle forms pyruvate kinase, hepatic phosphofructokinase, apolipoprotein B apolipoprotein A2 cluster, lipoprotein lipase, hepatic triglyceride lipase, very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor, Pima insulin resistance locus chromosome 4. several candidates, specific informative marker available; consequently, tested surrounding region highly informative markers. regions included diabetes-associated ras-like gene, rad, cholesterol ester-transfer gene, mapped chromosome 16. Additionally, tested linkage markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene Friedreich's ataxia region. regions tested linkage microsatellite polymorphisms > 450 individuals minimum 16 Caucasian families parametric (LINKAGE 5.1) nonparametric (affected pedigree member) models.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
