 effects dimethyl sulphoxide glycerol ox brain microsomal Na(+)+K(+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3), K(+)-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase K(+)-dependent muscle pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) studied. Dimethyl sulphoxide concentrations 20% (v/v) found stimulate p-nitrophenyl phosphatase pyruvate kinase increasing affinity K(+) inhibit Na(+)+K(+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. latter enzyme activity also inhibited glycerol, like dimethyl sulphoxide, stimulated K(+)-activated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase wide range concentrations. solvent effects promptly reversed dilution. Similarity found glycerol dimethyl sulphoxide, one hand, ATP, other, stimulatory effect ability increase ouabain- oligomycin-sensitivity K(+)-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase. However, solvents, ATP, increased binding K(+) microsomes. findings suggested solvents may act K(+)-dependent enzymes altering state solvation activating cation well changing enzyme structure.
