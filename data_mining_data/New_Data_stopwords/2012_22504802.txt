 previously reported Corynebacterium glutamicum strain DeltaldhADeltappc+alaD+gapA, overexpressing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding gapA, shows significantly improved glucose consumption alanine formation oxygen deprivation conditions (T. Jojima, M. Fujii, E. Mori, M. Inui, H. Yukawa, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 87:159-165, 2010). study, employ stepwise overexpression chromosomal integration total four genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (herein referred glycolytic genes) demonstrate successive improvements C. glutamicum glucose metabolism oxygen deprivation. addition gapA, overexpressing pyruvate kinase-encoding pyk phosphofructokinase-encoding pfk enabled strain GLY2/pCRD500 realize respective 13% 20% improved rates glucose consumption alanine formation compared GLY1/pCRD500. Subsequent overexpression glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-encoding gpi strain GLY3/pCRD500 improved glucose metabolism. Notably, alanine productivity yield increased overexpression step. 48 h incubation, GLY3/pCRD500 produced 2,430 mM alanine yield 91.8%. 6.4-fold higher productivity wild-type strain. Intracellular metabolite analysis showed gapA overexpression led decreased concentration metabolites upstream glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting overexpression resolved bottleneck glycolysis. Changing ratios extracellular metabolites overexpression glycolytic genes resulted reduction intracellular NADH/NAD(+) ratio, also plays important role improvement glucose consumption. Enhanced alanine dehydrogenase activity using high-copy-number plasmid accelerated overall alanine productivity. Increase glycolytic enzyme activities promising approach make drastic progress growth-arrested bioprocesses.
