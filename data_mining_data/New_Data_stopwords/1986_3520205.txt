 basal state, presence L pyruvate kinase (LPK) constantly observed primary human liver cell cultures initiated explants, cells examined immunofluorescence double labelling. short-term insulin incubation, pyruvate kinase (MPK) appeared. Therefore, LPK MPK located cells. previously obtained results isolated rat hepatocytes demonstrated short-term regulation M2PK insulin function dose and/or incubation time. present work established similar conditions govern regulation isozyme vitro human hepatocytes.
