 3-Arsonopyruvate prepared four steps glycine. arsenic-carbon bond formed Meyer reaction alkaline arsenite 2-bromo-3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid; 3-arsono-2-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid formed oxidized periodate give 3-arsonopyruvate. proves alternative substrate phosphoenolpyruvate mutase, giving pyruvate, assayed using lactate dehydrogenase. K(m) 20 microM, similar observed natural substrate phosphonopyruvate (17 microM), whereas kcat. 0.01 s-1 much lower phosphonopyruvate (58 s-1). Arsonopyruvate competitively inhibited action mutase phosphonopyruvate.
