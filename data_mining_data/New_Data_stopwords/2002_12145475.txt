 BACKGROUND: previously shown several metabolic genes downregulated failing human heart. tested hypothesis mechanical unloading might reverse process. METHODS: Clinical data myocardial tissue collected 14 failing hearts paired time implantation explantation left ventricular assist device (LVAD) compared 10 non-failing hearts. Transcript levels key regulators energy metabolism atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) measured real-time quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: expression glucose transporter 1 4 (GLUT1, GLUT4), muscle carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (mCPT-1), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) downregulated 80% failing heart. Although LVAD treatment improved clinical markers heart failure (decrease left ventricular diastolic dimension normalization serum sodium), UCP3 expression reversed non-failing transcript levels following mechanical unloading. CONCLUSIONS: LVAD treatment partially reverses depressed metabolic gene expression failing human heart. Reversal depressed UCP3 expression may important mechanism reducing formation oxygen-derived free radicals. studies necessary define effects mechanical unloading post-transcriptional mechanisms.
