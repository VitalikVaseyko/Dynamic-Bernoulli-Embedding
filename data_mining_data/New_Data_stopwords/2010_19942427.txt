 Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays key role reprogramming cancer metabolism activating transcription genes encoding glucose transporters glycolytic enzymes, take glucose convert lactate; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, shunts pyruvate away mitochondria; BNIP3, triggers selective mitochondrial autophagy. shift oxidative glycolytic metabolism allows maintenance redox homeostasis cell survival conditions prolonged hypoxia. Many metabolic abnormalities cancer cells increase HIF-1 activity. result, feed-forward mechanism activated drives HIF-1 activation may promote tumor progression.
