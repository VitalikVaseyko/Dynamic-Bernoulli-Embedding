 OBJECTIVE: instituted quality improvement process enhance capacity diagnose genetic hemolytic conditions neonates extreme hyperbilirubinemia. STUDY DESIGN: 1-year period, whenever total serum bilirubin (TSB) >25 mg dl(-1) special evaluation performed. deemed erythrocyte membrane defect likely, based red blood cell morphology, EMA-flow cytometry performed. Otherwise 'next-generation' sequencing performed using panel genes involved neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. RESULT: Ten neonates TSB 25 mg dl(-1). Two others evaluated part process request attending neonatologists, TSB >14 mg dl(-1) first hours birth required phototherapy 1 week. Explanations jaundice found 12 neonates. Five hereditary spherocytosis, three also ABO hemolytic disease. Two pyruvate kinase deficiency. One severe G6PD deficiency. four ABO hemolytic disease. CONCLUSION: basis present small case series, suggest among neonates extreme hyperbilirubinemia, productive pursue genetic basis hemolytic disease.
