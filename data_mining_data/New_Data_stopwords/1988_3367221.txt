 Analysis slow axonal transport sciatic primary visual systems BB rats spontaneous diabetes 2.5-3.5 months duration revealed delay transport neurofilament (NF) subunits, tubulin, actin, 60, 52, 30 kDa polypeptides systems. polypeptides examined affected uniformly. Rather, transport 60, 52, 30 kDa polypeptides rapidly moving component tubulin, constituents slow component b (SCb) axonal transport, appeared severely delayed transport polypeptide constituents slow component (SCa), NF slow-moving tubulin. Transport impaired diabetic BB rats maintained normoglycemic optimal doses insulin. 52 kDa polypeptide constituent SCb identified neuron-specific enolase, 30 60 kDa polypeptides likely aldolase pyruvate kinase; 3 glycolytic enzymes. Morphometric analysis revealed cross-sectional area sciatic axons increased proximally level motor roots decreased distally level tibial nerve. changes slow transport caliber observed central peripheral axonal systems diabetic BB rats virtually identical previously described rats streptozotocin-induced diabetes, another model insulin-dependent diabetes. models, alterations axonal caliber likely secondary impairment axonal transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
