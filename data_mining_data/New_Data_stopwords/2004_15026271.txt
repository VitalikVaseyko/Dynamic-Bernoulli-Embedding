 BACKGROUND: Vanadate treatment diabetic rats reported correct altered carbohydrate metabolism antioxidant status. However, vanadate exerts effects relatively high doses several toxic effects produced. used low doses vanadate combination Trigonella foenum graecum seed powder (TSP) evaluated effect enzyme changes diabetic rats. METHODS: Alloxan-diabetic rats treated separately insulin, vanadate (0.6 mg/ml), TSP combined dose Vanadate (0.2 mg/ml) TSP 21 days. end experimental period, blood glucose levels activities pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalase (CAT) measured cytosolic fraction liver kidney. RESULTS: Blood glucose levels increased markedly diabetic rats. Treatment antidiabetic compounds resulted reduction glucose levels. Rats treated combined dose vanadate trigonella glucose levels comparable control ones. Similar results obtained activities PK, PEPCK, SOD, GPx, GR, CAT liver kidney diabetic rats. Combined dose vanadate Trigonella found effective correcting alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Lower doses vanadate could used combination TSP effectively counter diabetic alterations without toxic side effects.
