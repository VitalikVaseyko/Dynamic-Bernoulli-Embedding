 Experimental diabetes rats associated degree hypothyroidism. Hepatic enzymes involved carbohydrate lipid metabolism estimated control (untreated), control +T3 treated, alloxan diabetic alloxan diabetic + T3-treated rats. key glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, decreased activity diabetes unchanged treatment T3. contrast, certain enzymes involve lipogenesis, ATP-citrate lyase 'malic' enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decreased activity diabetes, increased to, above, control values diabetic rats treated T3. suggested T3 deficiency may play role decrease enzyme activities observed experimental diabetes, particular, enzymes associated lipogenesis provision NADPH.
