 mechanisms responses enzyme different hormones metabolites several enzymes single hormone surprisingly varied. neither operon lipogenic enzymes common step hormones metabolites coordinately regulate expression lipogenic genes. bacteria, coordinated expression several enzymes single metabolic pathway often achieved organizing genes operons. operon group genes linked together linear fashion producing polycistronic mRNA. Trans-acting factors regulate transcription genes interacting promoter/regulatory sequences 5'-flanking region 5'-ward genes. vertebrate animals, however, coordinated control gene transcription achieved linking individual genes, putting 5'-flanking regions genes regulatory sequence interacts common trans-acting factors. Genes controlled different hormones expected regulatory elements hormone. presence glucocorticoid cyclic AMP regulatory elements 5'-end PEPCK gene consistent notion. Transcription step hormones metabolites control pathways gene expression. levels mRNAs L-PK, ME, S11, S14 increased T3 post-transcriptional steps. Glucagon also regulates accumulation mRNA post-transcriptionally. Neither mechanism sequence organization regulatory elements known post-transcriptional control gene expression. case PEPCK HMG-CoA reductase, next steps determine precisely sequences 5'-region mediate hormone sensitivity feedback inhibition, respectively, whether trans-acting factors involved. genes discussed, identification regulated step must precede identification sequences confer hormone metabolite-sensitive regulation specific gene. general, probable hybrid gene approach, successful PEPCK HMG-CoA reductase, also effective defining cis-acting hormone- metabolite-regulatory elements genes. techniques applicable transcriptional post-transcriptional mechanisms. long-term objective understand molecular basis event intervenes binding hormone metabolite appropriate receptor altered enzyme level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
