 Forskolin, activator adenylate cyclase, inhibits mitogen induction glycolytic isozymes human peripheral cells. Inhibition lactate dehydrogenase isozyme activity correlated lowered mRNA levels, suggesting transcriptional block presence increased cAMP. Forskolin added mitogen, 12-24 h mitogen, strongly inhibits isozyme expression DNA synthesis, causes cells accumulate G0 early G1 phase cell cycle. data suggest DNA synthesis isozyme expression inhibited cAMP-sensitive step(s) early activation progression phase.
