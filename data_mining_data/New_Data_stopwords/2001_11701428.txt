 increase skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity measured skeletal muscle six healthy males eucaloric high-fat/low-carbohydrate (HF/LC; 5% carbohydrate, 73% fat, 22% protein total energy intake) diet compared standardized prediet (50% carbohdyrate, 30% fat, 21% protein). Biopsies obtained vastus lateralis muscle 3 days prediet (day 0) 1, 2, 3 days HF/LC diet. Intact mitchondria extracted fresh muscle analyzed PDK activity Western blotting PDK2 PDK4 protein. second biopsy taken time point frozen Northern blot analysis PDK2 PDK4 mRNAs. PDK activity increased linear fashion 3-day HF/LC diet significantly higher control 1 day. PDK activity 0.09 +/- 0.03, 0.18 +/- 0.05, 0.30 +/- 0.07, 0.37 +/- 0.09 min(-1) 0, 1, 2, 3 days, respectively. PDK4 protein mRNA increased maximally day 1, PDK2 protein mRNA unaffected HF/LC diet. Resting respiratory exchange ratios decreased 1 day HF/LC diet (from 0.79 +/- 0.02 0.72 +/- 0.02) remained depressed throughout 3-day dietary intervention (0.68 +/- 0.01). immediate shift fat utilization accompanied increased blood glycerol, beta-hydroxybutyrate, plasma free fatty acid concentrations. results suggest continuing increase PDK activity 3-day HF/LC diet due increasing PDK protein beyond 1 day. could due contribution another isoform total PDK activity continual increase PDK4 PDK2 specific activity.
