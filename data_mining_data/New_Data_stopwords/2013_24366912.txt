 BACKGROUND: Mutations isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 2 gene (IDH1/2) initially thought enhance cancer cell survival proliferation promoting Warburg effect. However, recent experimental data shown production 2-hydroxyglutarate IDH mutant cells promotes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1alpha degradation and, so, may unexpected metabolic effects. METHODS: used human glioma tissues derived brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) study expression HIF1alpha target genes IDH mutant ((mt)) IDH wild-type ((wt)) tumors. Focusing thereafter major glycolytic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), used standard molecular methods pyrosequencing-based DNA methylation analysis identify mechanisms LDHA expression regulated human gliomas. RESULTS: found HIF1alpha-responsive genes, including many essential glycolysis (SLC2A1, PDK1, LDHA, SLC16A3), underexpressed IDH(mt) gliomas and/or derived BTSCs. demonstrated LDHA silenced IDH(mt) derived BTSCs, including retain mutant IDH1 allele (mIDH(wt)), matched BTSC xenografts, parental glioma tissues. Silencing LDHA associated increased methylation LDHA promoter, ectopic expression mutant IDH1 immortalized human astrocytes. Furthermore, search Cancer Genome Atlas, found low expression high methylation LDHA IDH(mt) glioblastomas. CONCLUSION: knowledge, first demonstration downregulation LDHA cancer. Although unexpected findings, silencing LDHA downregulation several glycolysis essential genes raise intriguing possibility IDH(mt) gliomas limited glycolytic capacity, may contribute slow growth better prognosis.
