 Sequencing open reading frame 450 bp downstream yeast VPS35 gene revealed putative peptide 452 amino acids 52.7 kDa. predicted amino acid sequence 45% identity 55-kDa subunit 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6- bisphosphatase (EC 2.7.1.105/EC 3.1.3.46) rat liver 42% identity 480 amino acids center recently reported 93.5-kDa subunit yeast 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC 2.7.1.105). product new yeast gene similar entire sequence bifunctional rat liver enzyme and, unlike yeast 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, histidine residue essential fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase activity. Extracts chromosomal null mutant strain, fbp26::HIS3, incubated presence [2-32P]fructose 2,6-P2, lacked autoradiograms characteristic 56-kDa labeled band observed wild-type. band intensified 3-fold wild-type level FBP26 gene introduced multicopy fbp26::HIS3 background. similar increase found fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase activity extracts. FBP26 gene cause detectable increase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity introduced multicopy pfk26::LEU2 mutant, indicating gene product predominantly fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Growth glucose, fructose, galactose, pyruvate, glycerol/lactate impaired strains carrying fbp26::HIS3 allele.
