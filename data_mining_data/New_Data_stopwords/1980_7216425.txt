 Among microflora gingival sulcus members genus Capnocytophaga implicated possible etiological agents juvenile periodontitis systemic infectious diseases. study, pathway used C. ochracea strain 25 generating energy glucose investigated. grown complex medium supplemented glucose NaHCO(3), major end products formed acetate (4.6 mmol), succinate (11.0 mmol), pyruvate (4.3 mmol), oxalacetate (3.6 mmol), molar growth yield 58. Addition yeast extract growth medium caused (i) increase acetate (9.2 mmol) succinate (14.3 mmol), (ii) decrease pyruvate (0 mmol) oxalacetate (1.1 mmol), (iii) molar growth yield increased 75. Glucose transported phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system catabolized phosphoenolpyruvate enzymes Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. activities detected key enzymes Warburg-Dickens, Entner-Douderoff, hexose phosphoketolase pathways. growth yeast extract-supplemented medium, approximately 37% phosphoenolpyruvate carbon converted acetate pyruvate kinase, pyruvate-decarboxylating enzyme activity, acetate kinase; remaining 63% converted succinate via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, fumarate reductase.
