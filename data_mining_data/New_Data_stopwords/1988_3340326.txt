 studied postnatal ontogeny creatine kinase (CK) glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), enolase (En), pyruvate kinase (PK) rat brain uterus. 30-day-old rat, brain uterus express fetal isoforms CK-B, PGK-A, PGM-B, En-alpha PK-M2, differentiated isoforms En-gamma PK-M1. activity glycolytic enzymes uterus two-day-old rat brain, CK activity 3 times higher brain. activity glycolytic enzymes brain began increase (3-4-fold) 10 days birth, coordinated manner. CK activity began increase 5 days birth brain (4.2-fold) uterus (4.5-fold), suggesting dissociation glycolytic enzyme ontogeny CK. contrast brain, levels glycolytic enzymes uterus highest birth, suggesting action tissue-specific mechanism regulation constitutive levels glycolytic isozymes. Except PGM, enzymes showed increase total activity, response estrogen, uterus whole brain.
