 investigate basis LEDGF/p75 dependence HIV-1 integrase (IN) nuclear localization chromatin association, used cell lines made stably deficient endogenous LEDGF/p75 RNAi analyze determinants location cells ability interact IN. Deletion C-terminal LEDGF/p75 residues 340-417 preserved nuclear chromatin localization abolished interaction tethering chromatin. Transfer IN-binding domain (IBD) sufficient confer HIV-1 interaction GFP. HRP-2, human protein identifiable IBD domain, found translocate nucleus LEDGF/p75(-) cells. However, contrast LEDGF/p75, HRP-2 chromatin bound tether chromatin. single classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) LEDGF/p75 N-terminal region ((146)RRGRKRKAEKQ(156)) found deletion mapping shown transferable pyruvate kinase. Four central basic residues NLS critical activity. Strikingly, however, stable expression studies NLS(+/-) IBD(+/-) mutants revealed NLS, although responsible LEDGF/p75 nuclear import, dispensable stable, constitutive nuclear association LEDGF/p75 IN. wild-type LEDGF/p75 NLS-mutant LEDGF/p75 remain entirely chromatin associated throughout cell cycle, tethers chromatin. Thus, experiments reveal stable nuclear sequestration transcriptional regulator chromatin nuclear-cytosolic mixing cell division, additionally enables stable tethering chromatin. LEDGF/p75 multidomain adaptor protein interacts nuclear import apparatus, lentiviral proteins chromatin means NLS, IBD additional chromatin-interacting domains.
