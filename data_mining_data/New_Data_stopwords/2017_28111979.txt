 Many cancer cells exhibit altered metabolic phenotype, glutamine consumption upregulated relative healthy cells. metabolic reprogramming often depends upon mitochondrial glutaminase activity, converts glutamine glutamate, key precursor biosynthetic bioenergetic processes. Two isozymes glutaminase exist, kidney-type (GLS) liver-type enzyme (GLS2 LGA). majority studies focused GLS, summarize key findings glutaminases, describing structure function, roles cancer pharmacological approaches inhibiting activities.
