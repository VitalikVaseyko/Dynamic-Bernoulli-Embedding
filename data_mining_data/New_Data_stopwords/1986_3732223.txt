 effect NH4+ M2-pyruvate kinase isolated Ehrlich ascites tumor cells investigated. enzyme activated NH4+ efficiently K+. Moreover, synergistic interaction two cations observed since NH4+ increases affinity enzyme K+. affinity enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate also increased presence NH4+, conditions activating effect fructose-1,6-bisphosphate reduced. proposed NH4+ considered specific allosteric activator tumor enzyme.
