 Citrate-modified silver nanoparticles (AgNP-cit) received extensive attention due excellent antimicrobial properties. However, particles tend migrate vivo, thereby entering blood circulatory system granular form accumulating liver, causing toxic reactions. However, mechanism underlying AgNP-cit toxicity yet clear. Thus, adopted tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomics metabolomics approach identify proteins small molecule metabolites associated AgNP-cit-induced liver damage constructed interaction networks differentially expressed proteins metabolites explain AgNP-cit toxicity mechanism. AgNP-cit resulted abnormal purine metabolism mainly affecting xanthine key metabolites along pyruvate kinase bodily proteins, leading oxidative stress. AgNP-cit regulated metabolism amino acids glycerol phospholipids glycerol phospholipids, CYP450 enzymes key proteins, causing liver inflammation. Via alanine, isoleucine, L-serine dehydratase/L-threonine deaminase proteins, AgNP-cit altered metabolism glycine, serine threonine, cysteine methionine, affecting oxidation deamination, ultimately leading liver damage. work clearly explains toxic reactions induced AgNP-cit three perspectives, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, oxidation deamination, thus providing experimental basis safe application nanomaterials.
