 Malaria third prevalent cause global mortality interesting case evolutionary selection. response high frequency malaria infection, several host genetic factors selected, Hemoglobin variants, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency pyruvate kinase deficiency. Among popular host genetic factors, deficiency pyruvate kinase enzyme one important factor provide resistance malaria. Regulation enzyme level transcription important several factors may play crucial role regulation enzyme. DNA sequence variation epigenetic factors modifying transcriptional regulation gene explored context several diseases. present study, explored factors modifying transcription regulation pyruvate kinase gene help Bioinformatics tools. basis predictions hypothesize factor reduces availability (level) activity pyruvate kinase enzyme must play strong role resistance malaria. Thus, factors reducing activity (loss function) level pyruvate kinase selected provide resistance malaria primarily endemic regions.
