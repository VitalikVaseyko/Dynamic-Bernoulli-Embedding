 Allostery covalent modification major means fast-acting metabolic regulation. relative roles responding environmental changes remain, however, unclear. examine issue, using case study rapid decrease pyruvate kinase flux yeast upon glucose removal. main pyruvate kinase isozyme (Cdc19) phosphorylated response environmental cues. also exhibits positively cooperative (ultrasensitive) allosteric activation fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Glucose removal causes accumulation Cdc19's substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate. response retained strains altered protein-kinase-A AMP-activated-protein-kinase activity CDC19 carrying mutated phosphorylation sites. contrast, yeast engineered CDC19 point mutation ablates FBP-based regulation fail accumulate phosphoenolpyruvate. also fail grow ethanol slowly resume growth upon glucose upshift. Thus, yeast pyruvate kinase covalently modified response glucose availability, activity controlled almost exclusively ultrasensitive allostery.
