 Retraction platelet rich plasma clotted reptilase induced electrical stimulation. Optimal retraction obtained stimuli, applied 4 min, following characteristics: intensity = 150 volts, duration = 50 msec each, frequency = 10/sec. Electrically induced reptilase clot retraction shown inhibited EDTA, EGTA, methyl-xanthines, PGE1, acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, apyrase phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase MgCl2. results indicate electrical stimulation induces retraction PRP clotted reptilase triggering increased availability Ca2+ intracellular space.
