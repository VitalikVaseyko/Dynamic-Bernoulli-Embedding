 Activities glycolytic enzymes determined elutriation fractionated cultures Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown different carbon sources. Almost pure fractions single cells G1 state cell division obtained growth conditions tested, whereas stages enriched particular fractions. Specific activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase found constant cell cycle, reported van Doorn et al. (1988a), Journal Bacteriology 170, 4808-4815, (1988b), Journal General Microbiology 134, 785-790. contrast earlier reports, activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase trehalase also constant different states cell cycle. hexokinase phosphofructokinase shown apparent specific activity cell-free extract strongly diminished extracts contained less 0.5-1 mg protein ml-1. experiments van Doorn et al. (1988a) protein content outer fractions 20 times lower central fractions, suggesting alternative explanation observed changes enzyme activities cell cycle. Therefore, want rectify observations presented van Doorn et al. (1988a), conclude activities glycolytic enzymes vary greatly cell cycle S. cervisiae.
