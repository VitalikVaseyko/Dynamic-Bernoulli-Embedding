 test effect low ambient temperature muscular strain possible development muscle injuries, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 35) exercised speed 15 min-1 treadmill 6 degrees inclination 1.5 h warm (22 degrees C) cold (-10 degrees C) environment. Blood tissue samples collected 0 48 h postexercise. Blood glucose, lactate, pyruvate, cortisol, epinephrine (E) norepinephrine (NE) determined investigate effect energy metabolism. estimate degree physical strain, possible muscle injury regenerative processes muscles response exercise cold, serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), muscle beta-glucuronidase prolyl-4-hydroxylase (PH) activities measured. addition, histology hindlimb muscles m. soleus m. tibialis anterior examined. general, circulating level metabolic substrates exercise unaffected exercise independent ambient temperature. Plasma cortisol increased significantly exercise (P < 0.01), unaffected thermal strain. myocellular enzymes, serum CK increased 100% (P < 0.01) LDH 93% (P < 0.05) exercise cold compared exercise warm, indicating higher physical strain. However, exercise cold result muscle injuries judged unaltered muscular beta-glucuronidase, PH levels muscle morphology. concluded exercise type intensity used caused stress independent ambient temperature. addition, rats able maintain unaltered circulating levels energy substrates also cold. Finally, exercise cold increased muscular strain result muscle injuries.
