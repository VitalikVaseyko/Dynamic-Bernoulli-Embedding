 EST showing high values identity genes coding small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) selected EST library collection Trichoderma virens T59. cDNA gene (hsp23) sequence size 645 bp long amplified PCR. expression gene evaluated cultures grown temperatures ranging 4 41 degrees C. increased level expression detected fungus grown extreme temperatures (4, 10 41 degrees C). high-expression level also observed fungus grown 10% ethanol 4 h. hsp23 gene present unique copy T. virens genome, homologous gene also present five investigated Trichoderma species. Strain T. harzianum T34 transformed hsp23 gene T. virens T59 control pki (pyruvate kinase) promoter T. reesei ble (phleomycin resistance) gene selection marker. Statistically significant differences detected strains T34 two selected transformants biomass quantities obtained heat shock treatment colony diameters incubation 4 degrees C 2 months.
