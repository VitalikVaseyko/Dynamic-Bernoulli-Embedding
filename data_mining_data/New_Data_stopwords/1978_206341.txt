 ultramicrochemical technique adapted evolution enzyme profiles within individual human mammary tumors. Tandem observation adjacent stained lyophilized sections permitted dissection microgram quantities freeze-dried material within confirmed regions malignancy. Enzymes frequently monitored examine glycolytic, respiratory, metastatic capacity microanalyzed successfully: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), acid phosphatase (AP), aldolase (ALD), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GOPDH), hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PRK). enzyme activities higher infiltrating ductal carcinomas fibroadenomas. Extracts tumor cells mixed varying proportions brain muscle extracts rat evidenced modification expected activity. technical adaptation described provided sensitive methodology resolve problems relication, profile analysis, sample quantity, selectivity within heterogeneous tissues.
