 OBJECTIVE: analyze gene expression profiles prostate cancer (PCa) aim determining relevant differentially expressed genes subsequently ascertain whether differential expression maintained post-prostatic massage (PPM) urine samples. MATERIAL METHODS: Forty-six tissue specimens (36 PCa patients 10 controls) 158 urine PPM-urines (113 PCa patients 45 controls) collected December 2003 May 2007. DNA microarrays used identify genes differentially expressed tumour control samples. Ten genes technically validated tissue samples quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Forty two selected differentially expressed genes validated independent set PPM-urines qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Multidimensional scaling plot according expression microarray genes showed clear distinction control tumour samples. total 1047 differentially expressed genes (FDR</=.1) indentified groups samples. found high correlation comparison microarray RT-qPCR gene expression levels (r=.928, P<.001). Thirteen genes maintained fold change direction analyzed PPM-urine samples four (HOXC6, PCA3, PDK4 TMPRSS2-ERG), differences statistically significant (P<.05). CONCLUSION: analysis PCa DNA microarrays provides new putative mRNA markers PCa diagnosis that, caution, extrapolated PPM-urines.
