 distance obligatory monovalent divalent cations active site pyruvate kinase (rabbit muscle) used monitor structural changes various successive intermediates catalytic reaction relate structure activity substrate analogs. Determinations distance obtained measurements longitudinal relaxation rate (1/T1) methyl protons methyl ammonium ion, affected activating divalent cation Mn2+ various enzyme complexes. frequency dependence 1/T1 effects several complexes indicats observed relaxation rate changes modulated changes cation-cation distances. results interpreted sequence structural changes active site occur upon substrate binding, catalysis, product release. Substrate analogs good analogs phosphoenolpyruvate kinetic criteria induce structural changes analogous substrate. attempt made correlate cation-cation distance changes structural changes reported pyruvate kinase.
