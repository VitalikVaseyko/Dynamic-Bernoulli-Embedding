 previously shown infection Plasmodium yoelii malaria injection extracts malaria-parasitized red cells induces hypoglycemia normal mice normalizes hyperglycemia mice made moderately diabetic streptozotocin. Inositol phosphoglycans (IPGs) released outside cells hydrolysis membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), act second messengers mediating insulin action. C57BL/Ks-db/db C57BL/6J-ob/ob mice offer good models studies human obesity Type 2 diabetes. present study, show single iv injection IPG-A IPG-P extracted P. yoelii significantly (P < 0.02) lowers blood glucose STZ-diabetic, db/db, ob/ob mice least 4--6 h. Using rat white adipocytes, IPG-P increased lipogenesis 20--30% presence absence maximal concentrations insulin (10(-8) M) (P < 0.01) stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphatase dose-related manner. IPG-A IPG-P inhibited c-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) dose-related manner. Compositional analysis IPGs 24 h hydrolysis revealed presence myo-inositol, phosphorus, galactosamine, glucosamine, glucose IPG-A IPG-P. However, hydrolysis IPGs 4 h highlighted differences IPG-A IPG-P. functional similarities P. yoelii IPGs previously described mammalian liver. However, first report hypoglycemic effect IPGs murine models Type 2 diabetes. suggest IPGs isolated P. yoelii, fully characterized, may provide structural information synthesis new drugs management diabetes mellitus.
