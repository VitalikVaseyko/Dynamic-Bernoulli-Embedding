 Treatment rats bacterial endotoxin resulted significant induction hepatic nitric oxide synthase within 3 hours. response maximal 12 hours maintained 18 hours. induction nitric oxide synthase correlated well increase plasma nitrate plus nitrite concentrations also inhibition glucose synthesis subsequently isolated hepatocytes. decline rate gluconeogenesis also correlated inhibition flux phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase alterations flux either pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, suggesting nitric oxide-induced inhibition phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase may underlie decreased glucose production sepsis.
