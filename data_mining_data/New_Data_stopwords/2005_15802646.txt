 six enzymes mevalonate pathway isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis represent potential addressing pressing human health concern, development antibiotics resistant strains Gram-positive streptococci. previously characterized first four mevalonate pathway enzymes Enterococcus faecalis, characterize fifth, phosphomevalonate kinase (E.C. 2.7.4.2). E. faecalis genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction used clone DNA thought encode phosphomevalonate kinase pET28b(+). Double-stranded DNA sequencing verified sequence recombinant gene. encoded N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein expressed Escherichia coli induction isopropylthiogalactoside purified Ni(++) affinity chromatography, yield 20 mg protein per liter. Analysis purified protein MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry established E. faecalis phosphomevalonate kinase. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed kinase exists solution primarily dimer. Assay phosphomevalonate kinase activity used pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase couple formation ADP oxidation NADH. Optimal activity occurred pH 8.0 37 degrees C. activation energy approximately 5.6 kcal/mol. Activity Mn(++), preferred cation, optimal 4 mM. Relative rates using different phosphoryl donors 100 (ATP), 3.6 (GTP), 1.6 (TTP), 0.4 (CTP). K(m) values 0.17 mM ATP 0.19 mM (R,S)-5-phosphomevalonate. specific activity purified enzyme 3.9 micromol substrate converted per minute per milligram protein. Applications immobilized enzyme bioreactor drug screening design discussed.
