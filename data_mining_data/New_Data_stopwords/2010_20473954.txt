 Phosphofructokinase (Pfk) plays key role regulation carbohydrate metabolism. activity used indicator glycolytic flux microorganism. cloned characterized pfkA gene Bacillus subtilis, encodes enzyme phosphofructokinase. gene insertionally inactivated chromosomal level wild type strain strains lacking PEP:sugar phosphotranferase system (PTS). Although pykA gene immediately downstream pfkA gene, forming constitutive operon B. subtilis, pyruvate kinase activity altered pfkA mutant. inactivation pfkA gene strong impact growth B. subtilis wild type strain PTS mutants Spizizen's minimal media Schaeffer's sporulation media. Pfk inactivation also reflected timing percentage sporulation wild type PTS mutants sporulation media well production organic by-products (pyruvate, lactate, acetate).
