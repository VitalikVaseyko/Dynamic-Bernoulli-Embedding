 Increased aerobic glycolysis cancer, phenomenon known Warburg effect, observed various tumor cells represents major biochemical alteration associated malignant transformation. Although exact molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic change remain elucidated, profound biochemical alteration cancer cell energy metabolism provides exciting opportunities development therapeutic strategies preferentially kill cancer cells targeting glycolytic pathway. Several small molecules capable inhibiting glycolysis experimental systems shown promising anticancer activity vitro vivo. review article provides brief summary current understanding Warburg effect, underlying mechanisms, influence development therapeutic strategies cancer treatment.
