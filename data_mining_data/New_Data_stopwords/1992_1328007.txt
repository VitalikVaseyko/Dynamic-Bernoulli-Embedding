 Previous studies indicated role ischemia metabolic changes induced cholestasis. Liver pyruvate kinase key enzyme concurrent control glycolysis gluconeogenesis. experiment control pyruvate kinase activity investigated cholestatic rats. Pyruvate kinase kinetics changed sigmoidal type sham-operated rats hyperbolic type obstructed rats. change enzymatic kinetics paralleled reduction portal blood flow, reached 50% control value 7 days obstruction. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (5 mumol/kg body wt) plus theophylline 0.1 mmol/L failed inactivate enzyme injected portal veins rats whose livers obstructed 7 days before. kinetics changes lack phosphorylation control compatible ischemia.
