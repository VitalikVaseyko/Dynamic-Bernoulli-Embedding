 genome pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently contains deletions tumour suppressor gene loci, notably SMAD4, homozygously deleted nearly one-third cases. loss neighbouring housekeeping genes confer collateral lethality, sought determine whether loss metabolic gene malic enzyme 2 (ME2) SMAD4 locus would create cancer-specific metabolic vulnerability upon targeting paralogous isoform ME3. mitochondrial malic enzymes (ME2 ME3) oxidative decarboxylases catalyse conversion malate pyruvate essential NADPH regeneration reactive oxygen species homeostasis. show ME3 depletion selectively kills ME2-null PDAC cells manner consistent essential function ME3 ME2-null cancer cells. Mechanistically, integrated metabolomic molecular investigation cells deficient mitochondrial malic enzymes revealed diminished NADPH production consequent high levels reactive oxygen species. changes activate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), turn directly suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-directed transcription direct targets including BCAT2 branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2) gene. BCAT2 catalyses transfer amino group branched-chain amino acids alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) thereby regenerating glutamate, functions part support de novo nucleotide synthesis. Thus, mitochondrial malic enzyme deficiency, results impaired NADPH production, provides prime 'collateral lethality' therapeutic strategy treatment substantial fraction patients diagnosed intractable disease.
