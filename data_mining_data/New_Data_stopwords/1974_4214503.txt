 kinetic properties pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) Streptococcus lactis investigated. Positive homotropic kinetics observed phosphoenolpyruvate adenosine 5'-diphosphate, resulting sigmoid relationship reaction velocity substrate concentrations. relationship abolished excess heterotropic effector fructose-1,6-diphosphate, giving typical Michaelis-Menten relationship. Increasing concentration fructose-1,6-diphosphate increased apparent V(max) values decreased K(m) values substrates. Catalysis pyruvate kinase proceeded optimally pH 6.9 7.5 markedly inhibited inorganic phosphate sulfate ions. certain conditions adenosine 5'-triphosphate also caused inhibition. K(m) values phosphoenolpyruvate adenosine 5'-diphosphate presence 2 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate 0.17 mM 1 mM, respectively. concentration fructose-1,6-diphosphate giving one-half maximal velocity 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate 5 mM adenosine 5'-diphosphate 0.07 mM. intracellular concentrations metabolites (0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.4 mM adenosine 5'-diphosphate, 18 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate) suggest pyruvate kinase S. lactis approaches maximal activity exponentially growing cells. role pyruvate kinase regulation glycolytic pathway lactic streptococci discussed.
