 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) exploits light interactions photosensitizers induce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) uses phenomenon photosensitizer emitting fluorescence distinguish tumors normal tissue. standard photosensitizer used PDD 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), although entirely satisfactory. previously reported glucose-conjugated chlorin (G-chlorin) effective photosensitizer another widely used photosensitizer, talaporfin sodium (TS); however, G-chlorin hydrophobic. synthesized oligosaccharide-conjugated chlorin (O-chlorin) improved water-solubility. report herein accumulation cytotoxicity. O-chlorin synthesized examined solubility. Flow cytometric analysis performed evaluate O-chlorin accumulation cancer cells. evaluate intracellular localization photosensitizer, cells stained O-chlorin organelle-specific fluorescent probes. measured vitro fluorescence various photosensitizers half-maximal inhibitory concentrations evaluate effects PDD PDT, respectively. Xenograft tumor models established, antitumor visibility effects analyzed. O-chlorin first shown hydrophilic. Flow cytometry revealed 20- 40-times higher accumulation O-chlorin cancer cells TS, 7- 23-times greater fluorescence 5-ALA. vitro, cytotoxicity O-chlorin PDT stronger TS PDT, O-chlorin tended accumulate lysosomes. vivo, O-chlorin showed best effect PDT PDD compared photosensitizers.O-chlorin hydrophilic showed excellent tumor accumulation fluorescence. O-chlorin promising next-generation bifunctional photosensitizer candidate PDT PDD.
