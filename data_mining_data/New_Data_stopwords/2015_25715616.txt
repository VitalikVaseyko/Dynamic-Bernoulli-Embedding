 Blood lymphocytes children oncology diseases studied smears compared healthy ones examined closely selected group. following two methods used: traditional hematology method smear staining detection blood formula lymphocyte indices staining novel cytobiochemical method including 60-min incubation biochemical medium estimation activity succinate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase ratio, serve measure respiration glycolysis--Warburg effect, typical tumor. great increase lymphocyte size addition lactate found blood smears patients tumors. effect pronounced addition succinate cells healthy persons. Changes structure cells patients also related changes activity enzymes studied. changes considered transition metabolism structure cells state tumor. Cytobiochemical method allows higher diagnostic sensitivity patient examination efficiency medical care patients oncological diseases.
