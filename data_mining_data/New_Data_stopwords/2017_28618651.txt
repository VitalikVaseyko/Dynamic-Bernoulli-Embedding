 present study aimed evaluate modulatory effects hydroalcoholic extract Caralluma fimbriata (CFE) assaying activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism changes glycogen content (liver muscle) high-fat (HF) diet-induced diabetic rats. vitro glucose uptake studies carried psoas muscle adipose tissue. inhibitory effect extract alpha-amylase determined vitro studies. Male Wistar rats body weight around 180g divided five groups (n=8), two groups fed standard pellet diet three groups fed HF- (60%) diet. CFE (200mg/kg body weight/day) administered oral route group standard pellet diet rats HF-fed rats Metformin (Met) (20mg/kg body weight/day) administered oral route HFD+Met group 90 days. end experimental period, biochemical parameters related glycogen content liver muscle, intestinal disaccharidases like maltase, sucrase lactase assayed. Alterations activities enzymes glucose metabolism (hexokinase, phosphorfructoki nase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), intestinal disaccharidases glycogen content observed high fat diet-fed rats prevented CFE/Met administration. study, observed CFE/Met could significantly restore levels glycogen liver muscle key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism near normal groups-HFD+CFE HFD+Met. skeletal muscle HF-diet fed rats showed degenerative changes muscle myofibers fat deposition. changes attenuated HFD group treated CFE/Met retained normal structure appearance. concluded results CFE might value reducing alterations related carbohydrate metabolism high calorie diet consumption.
