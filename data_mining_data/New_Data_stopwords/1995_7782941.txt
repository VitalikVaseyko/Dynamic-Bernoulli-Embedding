 branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complexes regulated phosphorylation cycles catalyzed complex-specific protein kinases phosphoprotein phosphatases. Molecular cloning mitochondrial protein kinases established new family protein kinases eukaryotes appears related primary sequence histidine protein kinase family prokaryotes. Changes activities kinases stable, i.e., caused directly allosteric effectors, correlate inversely changes activity states complexes occur different nutritional states. example, BCKDH kinase activity increased BCKDH complex activity state decreased rats fed diets deficient protein. increase BCKDH kinase activity due increase amount BCKDH kinase protein bound BCKDH complex. message level BCKDH kinase also increases liver rats starved protein, suggesting pretranslational mechanism exists long-term regulation BCKDH kinase. Starvation high-fat feeding cause stable increase PDH kinase activity corresponding decrease activity state PDH complex. mechanism responsible defined.
