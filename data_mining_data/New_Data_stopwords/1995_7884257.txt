 Xanthine oxidase demonstrated important factor postischemic reperfusion injury. Allopurinol inhibitor xanthine oxidase. study, evaluated usefulness allopurinol prevention myocardial reperfusion injury open heart surgery. Twenty adult patients divided two groups; Ap-group (n = 10) administered allopurinol seven days operation control-group (n = 10) administered nothing. dose allopurinol ranged 100-300 mg/day. dose determined according renal function patients. Coronary sinus blood hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid, lactate, pyruvate, CK, CK-MB levels measured CPB, 5 15 min. aortic declamping, 5 min. CPB. Hypoxanthine xanthine levels Ap-group significantly higher control-group 5 15 min. aortic declamping, 5 min. CPB. Uric acid levels Ap-group significantly lower control-group 5 15 min. aortic declamping, 5 min. CPB. Lactate, pyruvate, CK, CK-MB levels different Ap-group control group. considered allopurinol suppressed reaction rate xanthine oxidase. Therefore, levels intermediates, hypoxanthine xanthine, high and, level final product, uric acid low Ap-group. However, allopurinol efficacy level lactate, pyruvate, CK, CK-MB, study.
