 insulin secretory response pancreatic beta-cells acute "square wave" stimulation glucose characterized first phase occurs promptly exposure glucose, followed decrease nadir, prolonged second phase. first phase release due ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel-dependent (triggering) pathway increases [Ca(2+)](i) thought discharge granules "readily releasable pool." follows second phase entails preparation granules release, perhaps including translocation priming fusion competency exocytosis. pathways responsible second phase include K(ATP) channel-dependent pathway need elevated [Ca(2+)](i) additional signals K(ATP) channel-independent pathways. mechanisms underlying additional signals unknown. Current hypotheses include increased cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA, pyruvate-malate shuttle, glutamate export mitochondria, increased ATP/ADP ratio. mouse islets, beta-cell contains 13,000 granules, approximately 100 "readily releasable" pool. Rates granule release slow, e.g., one every 3 s, even peak first phase glucose-stimulated release. phases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion enhanced agents glucagon-like peptide 1, increases cyclic AMP levels protein kinase activity, acetylcholine, increases diacylglycerol levels protein kinase C activity, single "readily releasable pool" hypothesis inadequate explanation insulin secretion. Multiple pools available rapid release rapid conversion granules rapidly releasable state required.
