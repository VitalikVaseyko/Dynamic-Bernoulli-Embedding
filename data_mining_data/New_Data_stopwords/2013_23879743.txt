 Pyruvate kinase (PK) highly regulated enzyme catalyzes final step glycolysis. PK hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (PaPK) distinguished PK enzymes eukarya bacteria responding known allosteric effectors apparently exhibiting cooperative regulation. determined crystal structure PaPK 2.2 resolution and, manner consistent lack response conventional effectors, observed canonical allosteric site occluded tyrosine. Unexpectedly, though, bound sulfate observed position equivalent 6'-phosphate sugar effectors, suggesting allosteric site, unknown effector sharing phosphate position. search three-carbon intermediates glycolysis revealed 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) potent allosteric activator PaPK. response abolished mutation residues contact sulfate arginine proposed interact 3PG carboxylate group. Regulation PK 3PG consistent ancestral glycolysis hyperthermophilic archaea intermediate produced irreversible enzyme, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Coordinated regulation within lower half glycolysis contrasts sharply conventional glycolysis 3PG produced reversibly PK regulated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, product phosphofructokinase, irreversible enzyme upper half pathway. Regulation PaPK carboxylate molecule rather sugar phosphate may reflect step evolution glycolysis predates dominance sugars metabolism.
