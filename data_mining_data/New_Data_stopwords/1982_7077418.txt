 effect 90% jejunoileal bypass procedure liver enzymes evaluated 11 obese Zucker fat rats 50% weight loss. Control tissues also collected 11 unoperated obese rats. jejunoileal bypass group, significant decrease phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. Pyruvate carboxylase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase activities altered. Fructose 1,6-biphosphatase, aldolase, aspartate aminotransferase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities increased jejunoileal bypass group. studies suggest jejunoileal bypass glycolysis reduced gluconeogenesis increased. Amino acids may provide essential energy source hepatic function.
