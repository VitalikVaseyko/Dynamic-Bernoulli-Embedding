 Extended longevity often accompanied frailty increased susceptibility variety crippling disorders. One striking features human aging sarcopenia, defined age-related decline skeletal muscle mass strength. Although various metabolic functional defects aging muscle fibres described last decade, known whether pathophysiological hierarchy exists within degenerative pathways leading muscle wasting. Hence, order identify novel biomarkers age-dependent skeletal muscle degeneration, applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics studying global muscle protein expression patterns. model system sarcopenia, employed crude extracts senescent rat gastrocnemius muscle, compared young adult tissue preparations. Using highly sensitive protein dye Deep Purple analysis 2-D separated muscle proteome peptide mass fingerprinting identification individual protein spots, differential expression pattern observed contractile proteins, metabolic factors, regulatory components heat shock elements. drastic increase shown alpha B-crystallin, myosin light chain MLC-1, phosphoglycerate kinase, adenylate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, albumin, aconitase nucleoside-diphosphate kinase aged fibres. contrast, expression pyruvate kinase, aldolase, creatine kinase, transferrin, alpha-tropomyosin myosin light chain MLC-3 decreased old skeletal muscle. Comparative 2-D immunoblotting selected candidate proteins confirmed effect aging skeletal muscle proteome. findings demonstrate severely perturbed protein expression pattern aged skeletal muscle, reflects underlying molecular alterations causing drastic decline muscle strength senescent organism. long-term, systematic deduction abnormal protein expression aged muscle proteomic profiling approaches may lead cataloguing cohort novel therapeutic targets treat muscular weakness aging population.
