 Activities four enzymes glycolytic pathway, hexokinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, determined vesicular brush-border preparation rabbit kidneys. specific activities enzymes decreased several-hundredfold brush-border preparation compared kidney homogenate, enzymes totally absent. Density-gradient centrifugation brush-border preparation yielded brush border even higher purity also characteristic pattern distribution contaminating intracellular membranes. presence hexokinase brush-border preparation could traced contaminating mitochondria, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase contaminating vesicles derived endoplasmic reticulum. brush-border vesicles contained ATP. intravesicular concentration 0.1mm estimated, indicating vesicles retained least part original content. Experiments fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (mol.wt. 20000) present cell lysis revealed much, all, brush-border contents exchanged medium. complete absence glycolytic enzymes brush-border vesicles, retained part original content, indicates brush border contain glycolytic enzymes vivo thought compartment own, somehow separated cytoplasm.
