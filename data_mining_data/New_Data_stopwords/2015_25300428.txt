 mtDNA non-synonymous germ line variation (G10398A; p.A114T) remained equivocal least mechanistic understanding showing association cancer. necessitated showing in-vitro over-expression within mitochondria either variants produces higher intracellular ROS, resulting differential anchorage dependent independent growth. features observed relatively higher ND3:114T variant. elevated amount intracellular carbonylated proteins reduced activity key glycolytic enzyme, Pyruvate kinase M2, along high glucose uptake lactate production pro-cancerous features observed. retrograde signaling surplus ROS generated post-ND3 over-expression regulated nuclear gene expression epigenetically, involving selectively apoptotic-DDR-pathways. feature ND3 over-expression, inducing ROS mediated pro-cancerous features cells vitro, replicated pilot study limited number sporadic breast tumors, suggesting importance mitochondrial germ-line variant(s) enabling cells acquire pro-cancerous features.
