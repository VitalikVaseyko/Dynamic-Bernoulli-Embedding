 differentiated normal cells, conventional route glucose metabolism involves glycolysis, followed citric acid cycle electron transport chain generate usable energy form adenosine triphosphate (ATP). occurs presence oxygen. hypoxic conditions, normal cells undergo anaerobic glycolysis yield significantly less energy producing lactate product. first highlighted 1920s Otto Warburg, metabolism exhibited tumor cells involves increased rate aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect. aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate molecules yielded glycolysis converted fewer molecules ATP even presence oxygen. Evidence indicates reasons tumor cells undergo aerobic glycolysis include: (1) shift priority accumulate biomass rather energy production, (2) evasion apoptosis fewer reactive oxygen species released mitochondria (3) production lactate fuel growth tumors. mini-review discuss emerging molecular aspects cancer metabolism Warburg effect. Aspects Warburg effect analyzed context established hallmarks cancer including role oncogenes tumor suppressor genes.
