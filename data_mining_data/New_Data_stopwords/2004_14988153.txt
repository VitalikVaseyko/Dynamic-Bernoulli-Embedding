 vivo selection may provide means increase relative number cells donor origin recipients hemopoietic chimerism. tested whether vivo selection using chemical inducers dimerization (CIDs) direct expansion transduced normal donor erythrocytes recipients chimerism using mouse model pyruvate kinase deficiency. Marrow cells normal CBA/N mice transduced vector (F36Vmpl(GFP)) promotes cell growth presence CIDs. Transduced cells transplanted minimally conditioned, pyruvate kinase-deficient recipients (CBA-Pk-1(slc)/Pk-1(slc)) establish stable chimerism. CID administration resulted expansion normal donor erythrocytes improvement anemia. preferential expansion normal erythrocytes also resulted decrease erythropoietin levels, reducing drive production pyruvate kinase-deficient red blood cells. CID-mediated expansion genetically modified erythrocytes could prove useful adjunct transplantation methods achieve erythroid chimerism.
