 proportion active (dephosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase perfused rat heart decreased alloxan-diabetes perfusion media containing acetate, n-octanoate palmitate. total activity dehydrogenase unchanged. 2. Pyruvate (5 25mM) dichloroacetate (1mM) increased proportion active (dephosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase perfused rat heart, presumably inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase reaction. Alloxan-diabetes markedly decreased proportion active dehydrogenase hearts perfused pyruvate dichloroacetate. 3. total activity pyruvate dehydrogenase mitochondria prepared rat heart unchanged diabetes. Incubation mitochondria 2-oxo-glutarate plus malate increased ATP NADH concentrations decreased proportion active pyruvate dehydrogenase. decrease active dehydrogenase somewhat greater mitochondria prepared hearts diabetic rats hearts non-diabetic rats. Pyruvate (0.1-10 mM) dichloroacetate (4-50 muM) increased proportion active dehydrogenase isolated mitochondria presumably inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase reaction. much less effective mitochondria hearts diabetic rats non-diabetic rats. 4. matrix water space increased preparations mitochondria hearts diabetic rats. Dichloroacetate concentrated matrix water mitochondria non-diabetic rats (approx. 16-fold 10 muM); mitochondria hearts diabetic rats concentrated dichloroacetate less effectively. 5. pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase activity rat hearts rat heart mitochondria (approx. 1-2 munit/unit pyruvate dehydrogenase) affected diabetes. 6. rate oxidation [1-14C]pyruvate rat heart mitochondria (6.85 nmol/min per mg protein 50 muM-pyruvate) approx. 46% Vmax. value extracted pyruvate dehydrogenase (active form). Palmitoyl-L-carnitine, increased ratio [acetyl-CoA]/[CoA] 16-fold, inhibited oxidation pyruvate 90% without changing proportion active pyruvate dehydrogenase.
