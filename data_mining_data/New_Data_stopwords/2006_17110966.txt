 Triclosan found potent inhibitor F(H+)-ATPase oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans increase proton permeabilities intact cells. Moreover, acted additively weak-acid transmembrane proton carriers, fluoride sorbate, sensitize glycolysis acid inhibition. Even neutral pH, triclosan could inhibit glycolysis directly irreversible inhibitor glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydro genase, aldolase, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). Cell glycolysis suspensions biofilms inhibited pH-dependent manner triclosan concentration 0.1 mmol/L pH 7, approximately lethal concentration S. mutans cells suspensions. Cells intact biofilms almost sensitive triclosan inhibition glycolysis cells suspensions resistant killing. Targets irreversible inhibition glycolysis included PTS cytoplasmic enzymes, specifically pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, lesser extent, aldolase. General conclusions triclosan multi-target inhibitor mutans streptococci, lack triclosan-sensitive FabI enoyl-ACP reductase, inhibition glycolysis dental plaque biofilms, triclosan retained initial repeated exposure, would reduce cariogenicity.
