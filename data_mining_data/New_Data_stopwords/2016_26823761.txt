 Failure pancreatic beta-cells closely associated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), intractable disease affecting numerous patients. Pyruvate kinase, muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) potential modulator insulin secretion beta-cells. study aims revealing roles possible mechanisms PKM2 pancreatic beta-cells. Mouse pancreatic beta-cell line NIT-1 used high glucose treatment PKM2 overexpression specific expression vector. Cell proliferation Thiazolyl blue assay, cell apoptosis annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/prodium iodide staining insulin secretion assay ELISA performed group. mRNA protein levels related factors analyzed real-time quantitative PCR western blot. Results showed Pkm2 inhibited high glucose conditions compared untreated cells (P < 0.01). overexpression significantly suppressed NIT-1 cell apoptosis (P < 0.01), induced cell proliferation (P < 0.05) insulin secretion (P < 0.05). Related factors showed consistent mRNA expression changes. Protein levels beta-catenin (CTNNB1), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) IRS2 promoted PKM2 overexpression (P < 0.01), indicating activated Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling. results indicated inductive roles PKM2 pancreatic beta-cell NIT-1, including promoting cell proliferation insulin secretion, inhibiting cell apoptosis, might achieved via activating Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling downstream factors. study offers basic information role mechanism PKM2 pancreatic beta-cells, lays foundation using PKM2 potential therapeutic target T2DM.
