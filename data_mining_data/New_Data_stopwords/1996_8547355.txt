 Cytosolic pyruvate kinase fractions B obtained salting procedure normal rat liver Morris hepatoma 7777, purified affinity chromatography Blue Sepharose CL-6B, shown similar electrophoretic patterns polyacrylamide gel pH 8.3 previously studied pyruvate kinase extracts chromatin cell nuclei. Three variants (alpha 1, beta 1, gamma 1) normal rat liver pyruvate kinase fraction (type L) greatest electrophoretic mobility, showed sigmoidal kinetics relation 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), sensitivity ATP fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP). fraction dominated normal liver fraction B (type M2), electrophoresis showed slower gamma 2 variant, similar fraction hepatoma. variants fractions B normal liver hepatoma linear kinetics sensitive ATP FDP. greatest differences showed pyruvate kinase fraction B Morris hepatoma. variants alpha 2, beta 2, gamma 3 cathodic linear kinetics relation PEP. insensitive normal signal molecules (ATP FDP). gamma 3 alkaline variant acquired sensitivity inhibition L-cysteine. Showing several-fold higher activity, much greater affinity main substrate, lack sensitivity feed-back inhibition ATP, responsible high rate aerobic glycolysis diminution Pasteur effect metabolic studies. probably encoded oncogene activation plays special role different metabolic strategies tumour cells.
