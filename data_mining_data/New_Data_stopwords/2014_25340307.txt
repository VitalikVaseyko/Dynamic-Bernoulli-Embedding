 Macrophages functionally heterogeneous cell population mainly shaped variety microenvironmental stimuli. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce classical activation macrophages (M1), whereas IL-4 IL-13 induce alternative activation program macrophages (M2). Reprogramming intracellular metabolisms required proper polarization functions activated macrophages. Similar Warburg effect observed tumor cells, M1 macrophages increase glucose consumption lactate release decreased oxygen consumption rate. comparison, M2 macrophages mainly employ oxidative glucose metabolism pathways. addition, fatty acids, vitamins, iron metabolisms also related macrophage polarization. However, detailed metabolic pathways involved macrophages remained elusive. Understanding bidirectional interactions cellular metabolism macrophage functions physiological pathological situations regulatory pathways involved may offer novel therapies macrophage-associated diseases.
