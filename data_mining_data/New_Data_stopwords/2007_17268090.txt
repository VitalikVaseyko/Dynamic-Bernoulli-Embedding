 Tetramethylpyrazine active ingredient Chinese herbal medicine. study, tetramethylpyrazine tested activities irradiated bone marrow stromal QXMSC1 cells. proliferation QXMSC1 cells measured MTS assay kit flow cytometry. identify proteins involved processes cellular molecular response tetramethylpyrazine irradiation damage, comparatively analyzed proteome nonirradiated, irradiated tetramethylpyrazine treated QXMSC1 cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used validate differentially expressed proteins. 20 Gy 60Co gamma irradition inhibited QMSC1 cells growth tetramethylpyrazine could reverse action due stimulating QXMSC1 cells G1 progression. Proteomic analytical results showed 18 spots changed irradiated QXMSC1 cells, 15 spots matched known proteins database searching. expression level proteins translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), galectin-3, increased irradiated QXMSC1 cells, calmodulin, pyruvate kinase decreased. Tetramethylpyrazine could prevent change reverse degree. function proteins involves hematopoiesis, cell cycle signal transduction. changes proteins confirmed RT-PCR mRNA levels. study suggested stimulating proliferation via tetramethylpyrazine played important role cure effect irradiated QXMSC1 cells helpful deeply understand mechanism tetramethylpyrazine molecular level.
