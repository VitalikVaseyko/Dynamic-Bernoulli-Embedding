 White spot syndrome virus (WSSV), causative agent white spot disease (WSD), serious aggressive shrimp viral pathogen worldwide distribution. genome replication stage (12 hpi), WSSV induces metabolic rerouting known invertebrate Warburg effect, boosts availability energy biosynthetic building blocks host cell. show unlike lipogenesis seen cancer cells undergoing Warburg effect, 12 hpi, long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) significantly decreased stomach cells WSSV-infected shrimp. means non-selective WSSV-induced lipolysis, LCFAs apparently diverted beta-oxidation used replenish TCA cycle. Conversely, 24 hpi, Warburg effect ceased, LCFAs significantly up-regulated composition also significantly altered. crayfish changes direction appeared favor formation WSSV virion particles. also found that, 24 hpi, 12 hpi, PI3K-Akt-mTOR-HIF1alpha pathway induced expression fatty acid synthase (FAS), enzyme catalyzes conversion acetyl-CoA LCFAs. WSSV virion formation impaired presence FAS inhibitor C75, although viral gene viral DNA levels unaffected. WSSV therefore appears use PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway induce lipid biosynthesis 24 hpi order support viral morphogenesis.
