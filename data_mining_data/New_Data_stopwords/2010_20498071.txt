 Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) commonly reported tumor parts Africa common tumor AIDS patients world-wide. KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) etiologic agent KS. Although KS tumors contain many cell types, predominant cell spindle cell, cell endothelial origin maintains KSHV latency. KSHV activates many cell-signaling pathways little known KSHV alters cellular metabolism latency. Warburg effect, common metabolic alteration tumor cells, defined increase aerobic glycolysis decrease oxidative phosphorylation energy source. Warburg effect adapts cells tumor environments necessary survival tumor cells. latent infection endothelial cells, KSHV induces aerobic glycolysis lactic acid production decreasing oxygen consumption, thereby inducing Warburg effect. Inhibitors glycolysis selectively induce apoptosis KSHV-infected endothelial cells uninfected counterparts. Therefore, similar cancer cells, Warburg effect necessary maintaining KSHV latently infected cells. propose KSHV induction Warburg effect adapts infected cells tumor microenvironments, aiding seeding KS tumors. Additionally, inhibitors glycolysis may provide unique treatment strategy latent KSHV infection ultimately KS tumors.
