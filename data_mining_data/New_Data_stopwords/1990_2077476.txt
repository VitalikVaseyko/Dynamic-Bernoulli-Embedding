 Aim study evaluate influence red cell aging process insulin receptor binding. erythrocytes 8 children high reticulocyte count 9 healthy age-matched subjects studied insulin receptor binding correlation pyruvate kinase (PK) activity creatine levels. Moreover maximum 125I-insulin bound % PK activity tested four red cell fractions different age. data show significant correlation 125I-insulin bound either PK activity creatine levels. vitro experiments red cell fractions different age (as tested creatine levels) evidence lower decay PK activity insulin bound (p less 0.05). results indicate creatine content best marker red cell age insulin receptor studies.
