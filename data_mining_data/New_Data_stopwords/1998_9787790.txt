 Previous data indicated tissue-specific regulation mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, especially brain testis. lack biochemical data rat testis PDH limits comparative analysis testis liver enzymes. Therefore, isolated cDNA clone encoding rat testis PDH E1 alpha isoform, determined nucleotide sequence, studied tissue-specific expression, characterized recombinant protein produced bacteria, compared liver counterpart. cDNA clone (2.2 kb) contained identical open reading frame (from nt 974 2149) previously reported (Cullingford et al., 1993 Biochim Biophys Acta 1216:149-153) contained long 5' untranslated region, little identity clone. Northern blot confirmed testis-specific expression isoform. Genomic DNA analyses PCR amplification suggested clone gene product distinct X-linked somatic counterpart. biochemical kinetic analyses revealed purified recombinant rat testis PDH E1 (containing E1 alpha E1 beta subunits) enzymatically active phosphorylated vitro purified PDH-kinase p48 p45, similar recombinant human liver enzyme. current data thus indicate differential regulation testis PDH observed animal model may result differential modulation PDH-kinase -phosphatase tissue rather presence functionally different PDH E1 subunit.
