 Carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP) identified transcription factor binds carbohydrate response element promoter pyruvate kinase, liver red blood cells. ChREBP activated metabolites derived glucose suppressed adenosine monophosphate (AMP), ketone bodies cyclic cAMP. ChREBP regulates gene transcription related glucose lipid metabolism. Findings knockout mice human subjects suggest ChREBP helps induce hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance. Moreover, tumor cells, ChREBP promotes aerobic glycolysis p53 inhibition, resulting tumor cell proliferation. Anti-diabetic anti-lipidemic drugs atorvastatin, metformin, bile acid sequestrants, docosahexaenoic acid eicosapentaenoic acid may affect ChREBP transactivity. Secretory proteins fibroblast growth factor 21 ANGPTL8 (Betatrophin) may promising candidates biologic markers reflecting ChREBP transactivity. Thus, ChREBP associated metabolic diseases cancers, may link them.
