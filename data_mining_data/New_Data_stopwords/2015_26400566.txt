 Hepatocellular steatosis constitutes frequent liver disease western countries may progress steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). lipid droplet (LD)-associated proteins perilipin, adipophilin, TIP47 ("tail interacting protein 47 kDa"), S3-12 myocardial LD protein (MLDP), so-called perilipins 1-5 (PAT family) govern formation, maintenance degradation LDs. lack perilipin mice inhibits obesity lack adipophilin TIP47 inhibit development fatty liver disease. long-term cell culture models well liver biopsies patients different acute chronic liver diseases, LD-associated proteins sequentially recruited LDs regulated via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha PPARgamma well posttranscriptionally via alternative splicing, LD fusion lipolysis. Whereas TIP47 MLDP coat small newly formed LDs acute microvesicular steatosis, adipophilin constitutes robust general marker LDs many different cell types. Perilipin important long-term storage lipids macrovesicular steatosis controls lipolysis via hormone-dependent phosphorylation. malignant transformation, increased formation small LDs overexpression adipophilin, TIP47 MLDP detected, possibly expression altered tumor metabolism analogous Warburg effect. Adipophilin correlates positively proliferation rate HCC cells. Cultured cells downregulation TIP47 adipophilin via small interfering RNA (siRNA) small hairpin RNA (shRNA) show less larger LDs reduced neutral fat content.
