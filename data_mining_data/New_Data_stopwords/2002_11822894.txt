 simplicity fermentation process (anaerobic pH, temperature, agitation control) ethanologenic Escherichia coli KO11 LY01 makes attractive system investigate utility gene arrays biotechnology applications. using system, gene expression, glycolytic flux, growth rate compared glucose-grown xylose-grown cells. Although initial metabolic steps differ, ethanol yields sugars essentially identical weight basis, little carbon diverted biosynthesis. Expression 27 genes changed 2-fold strains. included induction xylose-specific operons (xylE, xylFGHR, xylAB) regulated XylR cyclic AMP-CRP system repression Mlc-regulated genes encoding glucose uptake (ptsHIcrr, ptsG) mannose uptake (manXYZ) growth xylose. However, expression genes encoding central carbon metabolism biosynthesis differed less 2-fold. Simple statistical methods used investigate subtle changes. reproducibility (coefficient variation 12%) expression measurements (mRNA cDNA) found similar typically observed vitro measurements enzyme activities. Using Student's test, many smaller significant sugar-dependent changes identified (p < 0.05 strains). total 276 genes highly expressed growth xylose; 307 genes highly expressed glucose. Slower growth (lower ATP yield) xylose accompanied decreased expression 62 genes concerned biosynthesis small molecules (amino acids, nucleotides, cofactors, lipids), transcription, translation; 5 genes expressed higher level. xylose-grown cells, 90 genes associated transport, catabolism, regulation pathways alternative carbon sources expressed higher levels glucose-grown cells, consistent relaxation control cyclic AMP-CRP regulatory system. Changes expression genes encoding Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway excellent agreement calculated changes flux individual metabolites. Flux one step, pyruvate kinase, predicted higher glucose fermentation. Expression levels (glucose/xylose) higher glucose-grown cells EMP genes except isoenzymes encoding pyruvate kinase (pykA pykF). Expression isoenzymes generally higher xylose fermentation statistically higher strains pykF encoding isoenzyme activated fructose-6-phosphate, key metabolite connecting pentose metabolism EMP pathway. coordinated changes expression genes encoding EMP pathway suggest presence common regulatory system flux control within EMP pathway may broadly distributed. contrast, expression levels genes encoding Pentose-Phosphate pathway differ significantly glucose-grown xylose-grown cells.
