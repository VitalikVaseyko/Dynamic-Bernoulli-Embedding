 examined patterns cyclic AMP-dependent protein phosphorylation membranes prepared rat cortical synaptosomes following gel electrophoresis autoradiography. determined optimum pH (6.2), time (20 s), Mg2+ concentration (10 mM) cyclic AMP concentration (5 microM) reaction. also found detergents Triton X-100 gramicidin enhanced cyclic AMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. Inhibitors Na+, K+ ATPase (ouabain, NaF, vanadate) enhanced protein phosphorylation. effect occurred presence absence detergent. addition purified bovine brain cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit enhanced membrane protein phosphorylation. addition homogeneous neural (bovine brain) non-neural (bovine skeletal muscle) cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase type II regulatory subunit partially inhibited protein phosphorylation. neural non-neural regulatory subunits behaved similarly. addition cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase (Mr = 41,000) phosphorylated cyclic AMP-independent fashion. also examined phosphorylation pattern membranes prepared rat heart found number acceptor substrates much less nervous system.
