 L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) key enzyme glycolytic pathway specifically expressed liver and, lesser degree, small intestine kidney. One important characteristic L-PK gene expression strong activation glucose insulin complete inhibition fasting glucagon treatment. previously established entire rat L-PK gene plus 3.2 kbp 5'-flanking region functions mice tissue-specific hormonally regulated manner, various deletions 3.2 kbp 5'-flanking regions tested transgenic animals map cis-acting elements involved transcriptional gene regulation. experiments indicate proximal region -183 +11 confers tissue specificity contains information necessary dietary hormonal control L-PK gene expression vivo. found, however, transcriptional activity generated proximal promoter fragment modulated distal sequences tissue-specific manner. (i) Sequences bp -183 -392 seem play dual role liver small intestine; induce L-PK expression liver repress small intestine. (ii) Sequences bp -392 -1170 seem additional effect promoter activity. (iii) bp -1170 -2080, found putative extinguisher whose transcriptional inhibitory effect much marked small intestine liver. (iv) Finally, bp -2080 -3200, identified activating sequence required full expression gene liver.
