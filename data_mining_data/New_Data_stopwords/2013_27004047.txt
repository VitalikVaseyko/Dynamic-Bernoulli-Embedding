 purpose study investigate effects Commiphora mukul gum resin ethanolic extract (CMEEt) administration altered activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism changes glycogen content (liver muscle) lipids (liver heart) streptozotocin (STZ) induced insulin deficient diabetic Wistar albino rats. Diabetes induced intraperitoneal injection STZ (55 mg/kg body wt) male Wistar rats. animals divided four groups: Control (C), control-treated (C+CM), diabetic (D) diabetic-treated group (D+CM). Diabetic-treated control-treated rats treated C. mukul gum resin ethanolic extract (CMEEt) 2 ml distilled water, orally (200 mg/kg body weight/day 60 days). end experimental period, biochemical parameters related carbohydrate lipid metabolism assayed. significant enhancement tissue lipids (heart liver) total cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids free fatty acids diabetic rats nearer normalized diabetic treated rats (D+CM). Alterations activities enzymes glucose metabolism (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) lipid metabolism (fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme lipoprotein lipase) observed diabetic (D) rats prevented CMEEt administration. conclusion, findings indicate improvement glucose lipid metabolisms STZ induced diabetic rats treatment Commiphora mukul suggest plant used adjuvant prevention and/or management insulin deficiency disorder related it.
