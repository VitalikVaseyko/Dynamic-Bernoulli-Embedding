 delicate homeostatic balance glucose fatty acid metabolism relation whole-body energy regulation influenced mitochondrial function. determined expression regulation mitochondrial enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4, PDK2, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b, malonyl-coenzyme decarboxylase skeletal muscle people normal glucose tolerance (NGT) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Vastus lateralis biopsies obtained NGT (n = 79) T2DM (n = 33) men women matched age body mass index. subset participants participated 4-month lifestyle intervention program consisting unsupervised walking exercise. Muscle biopsies analyzed expression DNA methylation status. Primary myotubes derived biopsies obtained NGT individuals metabolic studies. Cultured skeletal muscle exposed agents mimicking exercise activation messenger RNA (mRNA) expression analysis. mRNA expression PDK4, PDK2, malonyl-coenzyme decarboxylase increased skeletal muscle T2DM patients. Methylation PDK4 promoter reduced T2DM inversely correlated PDK4 expression. Moreover, PDK4 expression positively correlated body mass index, blood glucose, insulin, C peptide, hemoglobin A(1c). lifestyle intervention program resulted increased PDK4 mRNA expression NGT individuals, T2DM. Exposure caffeine palmitate increased PDK4 mRNA cultured skeletal muscle system. findings reveal skeletal muscle expression PDK4 related genes regulating mitochondrial function reflects alterations substrate utilization clinical features associated T2DM. Furthermore, hypomethylation PDK4 promoter T2DM coincided impaired response PDK4 mRNA exercise.
