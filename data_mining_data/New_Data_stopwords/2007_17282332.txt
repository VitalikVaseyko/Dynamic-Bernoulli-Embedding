 response metabolic network human red blood cell investigated using E-Cell simulation system pyruvate kinase (PK) deficient. results several downstream metabolites glycolysis pathway accumulate good agreement experimental data reported literatures. accumulation results reaction phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) catalyzes reversing direction. Mathematical analysis simulation results shows PGK-catalyzing reaction reversing direction happens simultaneously abrupt change second derivative ATP quantity.
