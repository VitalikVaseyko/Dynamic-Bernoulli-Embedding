 3'-amino-3'-deoxy adenosine enzymatically converted 3'-amino-3'-deoxy ATP. ATP analogue incorporated 3'-terminal adenosine position Escherichia coli tRNA. modified tRNA aminoacylated phenylalanine use E. coli phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase. phenylalanine attached 3'-amino group tRNA, shown high resistance base-catalyzed hydrolysis contrast normal lability phenylalanyl-tRNA. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases charge 3'-amino-3'-deoxy tRNA kinetics similar charging reaction normal tRNA substrate. phenylalanyl-3'-amino-3'-deoxy tRNA used protein-synthesizing system directed poly(U) vitro, molecule capable receiving acetyl-phenylalanine donor site ribosome. However, ribosome unable cleave amide bond connecting phenylalanine tRNA molecule; hence, phenylalanyl-3'-amino-3'-deoxy tRNA acceptor donor activity protein synthesis. Failure ribosome cleave amide bond may due greater stability relative normal ester bond. However, may also due fact isomerization peptidyl chain 2' 3' positions adenosine prevented due amide bond 3' position, cleavage may normally occur peptidyl chain 2' position adenosine.
