 BACKGROUND MicroRNAs (miRNAs) class small non-coding RNAs strongly involved various types carcinogenesis, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). study aimed clarify whether miR-4417 promotes HCC growth targeting TRIM35 regulating PKM2 phosphorylation. MATERIAL METHODS Online software, including TargetScan miRanda, used predict potential target miR-4417. Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Western blot assays performed detect expression levels mRNA protein, respectively. Cell proliferation measured MTT assay apoptosis A549 cells examined flow cytometry. RESULTS Bioinformatics reveal TRIM35 mRNA contains 1 conserved target site miR-4417. High level miR-4417 low levels TRIM35 mRNA protein observed HCC cells compared normal liver cell line. Biological function analysis showed miR-4417 inhibitor inhibits cell proliferation promotes apoptosis HCC cells. Furthermore, verified TRIM35 functional target miR-4417 use luciferase reporter assay, TRIM35 overexpressing showed elevation proliferation reduction apoptosis HCC cells. subsequently investigated whether miR-4417 TRIM35 regulate HCC cell proliferation apoptosis PKM2 Y105 phosphorylation, results supported speculation miR-4417 targets TRIM35 regulates Y105 phosphorylation PKM2 promote hepatocarcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS findings indicate miR-4417 may function oncogene HCC potential alternative therapeutic target deadly disease.
