 Resting rat thymocytes partially degrade glucose aerobically CO2 H2O produce reactive peroxide anions. contrast proliferating cells, due enhanced induction glycolytic enzymes, degrade glucose almost completely lactate thus minimizing production reactive oxygen species. paper show conditions oxidative stress induction glycolytic enzymes cultured rat thymocytes markedly reduced. Furthermore, transfection assays rat hepatoma cell line Drosophila Schneider cells revealed reactive oxygen intermediates dramatically decrease transcriptional activities Sp1-dependent aldolase pyruvate kinase M2 promoters leading reduced reporter gene expression. results indicate cellular redox changes regulate gene expression reversible oxidative inactivation Sp1 binding.
