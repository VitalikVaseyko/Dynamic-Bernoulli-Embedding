 INTRODUCTION: Long intergenic noncoding RNA-p21 (lincRNA-p21) long noncoding RNA transcriptionally activated tumor protein p53 (TP53) hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A). involved regulation TP53-dependent apoptosis Warburg effect. investigated role lincRNA-p21 NSCLC. METHODS: LincRNA-p21 expression assessed tumor normal tissue 128 patients NSCLC correlated time relapse cancer-specific survival (CSS). H23, H1299, HCC-44 cell lines cultured hypoxic conditions silencing lincRNA-p21. TaqMan human angiogenesis array used explore angiogenesis-related gene expression. Levels protein vascular endothelial growth factor measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cell supernatants. Angiogenic capability measured human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay. Microvascular density tumor samples analyzed immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: LincRNA-p21 down-regulated tumor tissue, association observed TP53 mutational status. High lincRNA-p21 levels associated poor CSS patients (p = 0.032). patients classified according histological subtypes, impact lincRNA-p21 confined patients adenocarcinoma time relapse (p = 0.006) CSS (p < 0.001). explain poor outcome patients high lincRNA-p21 expression, studied role lincRNA-p21 angiogenesis vitro observed global downregulation expression angiogenesis-related genes lincRNA-p21 inhibited. Moreover, supernatants lincRNA-p21-inhibited cells significantly less angiogenic lower levels secreted vascular endothelial growth factor controls did. Finally, tumor samples high lincRNA-p21 levels higher microvascular density. CONCLUSIONS: findings suggest lincRNA-p21 affects outcome patients NSCLC adenocarcinoma regulation angiogenesis.
