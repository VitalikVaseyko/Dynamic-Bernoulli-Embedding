 OBJECTIVE: investigate expression tripartite-motif protein 25 (TRIM25) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) protein non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) explore role occurrence progression NSCLC. METHODS: expressions TRIM25 PKM2 protein detected 60 NSCLC specimens 20 adjacent normal lung tissue (>5 cm lesions) immunofluorescence histochemical method 10 fresh specimens NSCLC Western blotting. results analyzed relation clinicopathological features patients. RESULTS: positivity rates TRIM25 expression 45% 60 lung carcinoma specimens, significantly higher 20 normal lung tissues (10%, P=0.005). TRIM25 protein expressed 28.6% lung adenocarcinoma tissues 59.4% squamous carcinoma tissues (P=0.017). TRIM25 protein expression positively correlated TNM stages lymph node metastasis NSCLC (P<0.05). expressions PKM2 protein 60 cases lung carcinoma 73.3%,while 20 cases normal lung tissues expressions 30%(P=0.001). positivity rates PKM2 expression differed significantly lung adenocarcinoma squamous carcinoma (57.1% vs 87.5%, P=0.008). inverse correlation noted TRIM25 PKM2 expressions (P=0.026). CONCLUSION: TRIM25 PKM2 protein may participate occurrence progression NSCLC, expressions inversely correlated.
