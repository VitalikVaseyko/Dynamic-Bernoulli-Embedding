 Molecular-targeted therapy developed cancer chemoprevention treatment. Cancer cells different metabolic properties normal cells. Normal cells mostly rely upon process mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation produce energy whereas cancer cells developed altered metabolism allows sustain higher proliferation rates. Cancer cells could predominantly produce energy glycolysis even presence oxygen. alternative metabolic characteristic known "Warburg Effect." Although exact mechanisms underlying Warburg effect unclear, recent progress indicates glycolytic pathway cancer cells could critical target drug discovery. long history cancer treatment, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) recognized valuable source seeking bioactive anticancer compounds. great progress made identify active compounds herbal medicine targeting glycolysis cancer treatment. Herein, provide overall picture current understanding molecular targets cancer glycolytic pathway reviewed active compounds Chinese herbal medicine potentials inhibit metabolic targets cancer treatment. Combination TCM conventional therapies provide attractive strategy improving clinical outcome cancer treatment.
