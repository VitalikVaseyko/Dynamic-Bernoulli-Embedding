 review examines recent applications stable copper, zinc sulfur isotopes medical cases notably cancer. distribution natural stable isotopes particular element among coexisting molecular species varies function bond strength, ionic charge, coordination, also changes kinetics. Ab initio calculations show compounds metal binds oxygen- (sulfate, phosphate, lactate) nitrogen-bearing moieties (histidine) favor heavy isotopes, whereas bonds sulfur (cysteine, methionine) favor light isotopes. Oxidized cations (e.g., Cu(ii)) low coordination numbers expected favor heavy isotopes relative reduced counterparts (Cu(i)) high coordination numbers. discuss first observations Cu, Zn, isotopic variations, three elements closely related along multiple biological pathways, emphasis serum samples healthy volunteers cancer patients. found heavy isotopes Zn even greater extent Cu enriched erythrocytes relative serum, difference small sulfur. Isotopic variations related age sex relatively small. (65)Cu/(63)Cu ratio serum patients colon, breast, liver cancer conspicuously low relative healthy subjects. characteristic time Cu isotopes may change disease progression (a weeks) consistent turnover time element albumin half-life. parallel effect sulfur isotopes detected un-medicated patients. Copper liver tumor tissue isotopically heavy. contrast, Zn breast cancer tumors isotopically lighter healthy breast tissue. (66)Zn/(64)Zn similar serum cancer patients controls. Possible reasons Cu isotope variations may related cytosolic storage Cu lactate (Warburg effect), release intracellular copper cysteine clusters (metallothionein), hepatocellular biosynthetic dysfunction liver. suggest Cu isotope metallomics help evaluate homeostasis element patient treatment, notably chelates blockers Cu trafficking, understand many biochemical pathways element essential.
