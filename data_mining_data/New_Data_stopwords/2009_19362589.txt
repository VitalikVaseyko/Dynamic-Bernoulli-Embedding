 Cancer pathology associated aberrant gene expression altered metabolism. Whereas changes gene expression historically attributed mutations, become apparent epigenetic processes also play critical role controlling gene expression carcinogenesis. Global changes epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation histone modifications, observed cancer. epigenetic alterations aberrantly silence activate gene expression formation cancer; however, process leading epigenetic switch cancer remains unknown. Carcinogenesis also associated metabolic defects increase mitochondrially derived reactive oxygen species, create atypical redox state, change fundamental means cells produce energy. Here, summarize influence metabolic defects epigenetic processes. Metabolic defects affect epigenetic enzymes limiting availability cofactors like S-adenosylmethionine. Increased production reactive oxygen species alters DNA methylation histone modifications tumor cells oxidizing DNMTs HMTs direct oxidation nucleotide bases. Last, Warburg effect increased glutamine consumption cancer influence histone acetylation methylation affecting activity sirtuins histone demethylases.
