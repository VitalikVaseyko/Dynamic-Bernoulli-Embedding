 Although APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factor, WRINKLED1 (WRI1), shown required accumulation triacylglycerols (TAGs) Arabidopsis seeds, direct target genes established. Overexpression WRI1 up-regulated set genes involved fatty acid (FA) synthesis plastids, including genes subunit pyruvate kinase (Pl-PKbeta1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (BCCP2), acyl carrier protein (ACP1), ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS1), expression genes reduced mutants reduced WRI1 expression. Transient expression LUC reporter genes proximal sequences upstream ATG codon Pl-PKbeta1, BCCP2, KAS1 protoplasts activated co-expression WRI1, recombinant WRI1 bound upstream sequences vitro. seven WRI1 binding sites shared sequence [CnTnG](n)(7)[CG], n nucleotide designated AW-box, mutations AW-boxes near transcription start site 5'-untranslated region Pl-PKbeta1 abolished activation WRI1 protoplasts expression seed maturation. Although expression genes synthesis TAGs packaging oil bodies endoplasmic reticulum developing seeds required WRI1, expression up-regulated WRI1 overexpression. Thus, WRI1 promotes flow carbon oil seed maturation directly activating genes involved FA synthesis controlling genes assembly storage TAG.
