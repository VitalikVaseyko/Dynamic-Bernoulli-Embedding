 high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method rapid separation purine pyrimidine nucleotides, NAD+, NADP+, FAD, FMN, UDP-Glc, UDP-glucuronate, ADP-ribose found neutralized perchloric acid extracts rat liver described. Separation achieved within 26 min radially compressed column Partisil 10-SAX. column eluted gradient sodium phosphate sodium chloride. sodium phosphate purified passage tandem columns anion- cation-exchange resins remove uv-absorbing impurities. sensitivity procedure amount ATP contained 10 micrograms liver measured. recoveries nucleotides 87 107%. extracts rat liver interfering substances found elute GDP, UDP eluted NADP. Consequently, tissue contents UDP GDP determined second run measuring increase UTP GTP, respectively, following sample pretreatment pyruvate kinase (PK). tissue level NADP+ calculated difference total UDP NADP+ peak increase UTP following PK treatment. nucleotides amenable enzymatic analysis, namely NAD+, AMP, UDP-Glc, UTP, ATP, tissue contents measured enzymatically significantly different determined HPLC. However, ADP measured PK found 15% higher compared HPLC determination.
