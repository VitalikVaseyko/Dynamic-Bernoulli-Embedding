 process defining recruitment fuel pathway selection rainbow trout fast-twitch white skeletal muscle, clear near-maximal myosin adenosinetriphosphatase activity 10-s sprint supported solely phosphocreatine hydrolysis. conservative estimate ATP turnover 188 mumol X g wet wt-1 X min-1. rate force contraction decreased relative contribution anaerobic glycogenolysis became increasingly important. 10-min period burst swimming approximately 120% maximum aerobic steady-state swimming velocity trout determined Brett-type swim tunnel, fatigue associated near-depletion glycogen white muscle. ATP turnover supported anaerobic glycogenolysis 78 mumol X g wet wt-1 X min-1. glycolytic pathway appeared functional time control sites identified hexokinase phosphofructokinase (PFK-1). PFK-1 appear inhibited low muscle pH (pH 6.66). another exercise protocol lasting 30 min, complete exhaustion related glycogen depletion. sum glycolytic intermediates glucose 6-phosphate pyruvate exhaustion decreased dramatic 80% compared 25% decrease 10-min fatigue swimming protocol. large depletion glycolytic intermediates accompanied 80% fall ATP, 70-80% reduction ATP/ADP phosphorylation potential, 2.5-fold increase NAD/NADH. Associated changes marked displacement phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), combined glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-PGK reactions thermodynamic equilibrium. general conclusion, fatigue exhaustion viewed multicomponent biochemical process response low glycogen leveled one particular step glycolytic pathway.
