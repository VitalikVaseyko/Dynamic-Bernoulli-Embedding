 Proliferating cancer cells reprogram metabolic circuitry thrive environment deficient nutrients oxygen. Cancer cells exhibit higher rate glucose metabolism normal somatic cells, achieved switching oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis meet energy metabolites demands tumour progression. phenomenon, known Warburg effect, generated renewed interest process glucose metabolism reprogramming cancer cells. Several regulatory pathways along glycolytic enzymes responsible emergence glycolytic dependence. Non-coding (nc)RNAs class functional RNA molecules translated proteins regulate target gene expression. NcRNAs shown involved various biological processes, including glucose metabolism. review, describe regulatory role ncRNAs-specifically, microRNAs long ncRNAs-in glycolytic switch propose ncRNA-based therapeutics used inhibit process glucose metabolism reprogramming cancer cells.
