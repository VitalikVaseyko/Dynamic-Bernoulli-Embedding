 Recent studies demonstrated expression well activity Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIdelta(C) (CaMKIIdelta(C)) increased heart failure. Transgenic overexpression CaMKIIdelta(C) mouse hearts results severe dilated cardiomyopathy. far, little known CaMKIIdelta(C)-induced changes gene expression proteome alteration. hypothesize proteome changes similar found advanced heart failure assessed even short term overexpression CaMKIIdelta(C) vitro culture model. Thus, designed study using proteomic approach combined adenovirus-mediated gene transfer CaMKIIdelta(C) identify early CaMKIIdelta(C)-induced changes cardiac myocyte phenotype proteome level. CaMKIIdelta(C) overexpressed adenovirus-mediated gene transfer isolated cardiac myocytes adult rabbits 48 h. Proteome changes analyzed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry (MS). Overexpression CaMKIIdelta(C) resulted decreased expression 21 proteins (at least twofold change expression, P<.05, n=10). Using in-gel digest MS, identified 13 21 proteins. CaMKIIdelta(C) overexpression leads reduced abundance NADH dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase, creatine kinase M, heat shock protein 70, elongation factor Tu, superoxide dismutase. profile proteome changes induced CaMKIIdelta(C) overexpression 48 h displayed striking alterations metabolic proteins, cell-protecting proteins including antioxidants, proteins involved protein synthesis. Interestingly, observed proteome changes common phenotype failing cardiac myocytes protein level. altered proteins may act individually contributors heart failure, observed overexpression CaMKIIdelta(C) genetically altered mice.
