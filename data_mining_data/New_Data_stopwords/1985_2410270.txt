 expression specific non-specific rat liver messenger RNAs studied 3'-methyl-4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene (3'-MeDAB) carcinogenesis, using cDNA probes complementary mRNAs encoding aldolase B, L-type pyruvate kinase, albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, transferrin unidentified 2.7 X 10(3)-base mRNA. mRNAs specific undifferentiated cells, encoding aldolase unidentified 2.7 X 10(3)-base species re-expressed early, easily detectable 1st week 3'-MeDAB treatment. reached maximum expression 4th week. Simultaneously levels aldolase B L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs dramatically decreased compared controls, remained responsive induction high-carbohydrate diet. Albumin transferrin mRNA levels slightly modified course carcinogenic diet. terminal stage hepatocarcinogenesis, i.e. malignant hepatoma cells, expression inducibility aldolase B L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs similar normal adult rats mRNAs specific undifferentiated foetal stages also synthesized. early changes gene expression aldolases B, L-type pyruvate kinase 2.7 X 10(3)-base mRNA species could indicate carcinogenic diet modifies gene control mechanisms long inducing hepatoma.
