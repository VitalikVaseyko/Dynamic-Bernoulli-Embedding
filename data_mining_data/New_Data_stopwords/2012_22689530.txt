 functional therapeutic importance Warburg effect increasingly recognized, glycolysis become target anticancer strategies. recently reported identification group novel small compounds inhibit basal glucose transport reduce cancer cell growth glucose deprivation-like mechanism. hypothesized compounds target Glut1 efficacious vivo anticancer agents. Here, report novel representative compound WZB117 inhibited cell growth cancer cell lines also inhibited cancer growth nude mouse model. Daily intraperitoneal injection WZB117 10 mg/kg resulted 70% reduction size human lung cancer A549 cell origin. Mechanism studies showed WZB117 inhibited glucose transport human red blood cells (RBC), express Glut1 sole glucose transporter. Cancer cell treatment WZB117 led decreases levels Glut1 protein, intracellular ATP, glycolytic enzymes. changes followed increase ATP-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) declines cyclin E2 well phosphorylated retinoblastoma, resulting cell-cycle arrest, senescence, necrosis. Addition extracellular ATP rescued compound-treated cancer cells, suggesting reduction intracellular ATP plays important role anticancer mechanism molecule. Senescence induction essential role ATP reported first time Glut1 inhibitor-treated cancer cells. Thus, WZB117 prototype development anticancer therapeutics targeting Glut1-mediated glucose transport glucose metabolism.
