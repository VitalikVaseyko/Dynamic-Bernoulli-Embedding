 Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) lethal aggressive gynecological malignancy, abnormal cellular metabolism significantly contributes cancer onset progression. Here, report miR-29b negatively regulates AKT2/AKT3 expression, causing HK2/PKM2 downregulation leading decreased Warburg effect slowed ovarian cancer progression. Compared normal ovaries, ovaries epithelial cancer exhibited lower miR-29b expression cellular/histological levels. Glucose consumption lactate production experiments confirmed miR-29b's regulation EOC metabolism. luciferase reporter assay confirmed direct binding miR-29b AKT2/AKT3 3' UTRs. miR-29b silencing correlated increased expression AKT2/3, pAKT2/3, HK2, PKM2. Pyruvic acid NAD+/NADH levels also changed miR-29b expression suppressed; effect could blocked specific AKT inhibitors, suggesting miR-29b-AKT axis regulates Warburg effect ovarian cancer. xenograft mouse models, miR-29b inhibited tumor formation vivo. vivo imaging also demonstrated miR-29b agomir inhibited relative uptake 18F-FDG xenograft tumors, suggesting miR-29b over-expression could negatively modulate tumor glucose metabolism vivo. Taken together, study suggests miR-29b regulates Warburg effect EOC via AKT2/AKT3 may provide novel options future treatments EOC.
