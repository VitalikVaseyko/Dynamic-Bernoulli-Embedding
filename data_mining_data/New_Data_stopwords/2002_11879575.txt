 Pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) key glycolytic enzyme Drosophila melanogaster. catalyzes conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate transfer phosphate group ADP form ATP. ATP provides energy cell growth metabolism, pyruvate participates many metabolic reactions. Therefore, PK plays important role cell metabolism. Southern blot analysis, PCR, sequencing used determine content Drosophila pyruvate kinase (Pyk) genomic clone, lambdaPK61. results indicated insert lambdaPK61 comprised 8330 bp upstream 7186 bp downstream transcription start point Pyk gene. size insert 15,516 bp total, contained six genes including Pyk. Deletion mapping applied identify promoter region cis-acting elements 5' PyK. Ten serial deletions produced PCR inserted upstream reporter gene (LacZ) form recombinant plasmids, transfected Drosophila S2 cells. results revealed regions -1475 approximately -1033 -1033 approximately -534 5' end PyK possessed positive regulatory function Pyk expression; i.e., increased gene expression. redundant putative cis-acting elements, including ecdysone response element (EcRE), E74A, broad complex zinc finger (BRCZ) binding sites. E74A BRCZ belong early genes regulated ecdysone. result suggested Pyk might regulated ecdysone, directly indirectly. However, results developmental profile Pyk expression Northern blot analysis suggested effects ecdysone Pyk repressive, inductive. addition, found regions, many cis-acting elements related egg embryo development. -258 approximately -254 -167 approximately -163 contained CAAT box, deletion regions decreased reporter gene expression. Therefore, suggested CAAT boxes functional promoter Pyk might located region -258 approximately +109. TATA box downstream promoter element identified around transcription start site Pyk. Additionally, PyK might share regulatory region unknown neighboring gene. concluded Pyk characteristics housekeeping gene.
