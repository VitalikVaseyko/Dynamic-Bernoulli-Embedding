 genomic clone (19 kb) harboring intron-exon sequences promoter-regulatory region E1 beta gene human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex isolated screening placental genomic library. nucleotide sequence promoter region (1245 bp) showed 18 differences (including mismatches, insertions, deletions) compared published sequence [Koike et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 5594-5597]. E1 beta promoter lacked TATA box homology contained initiator sequences (two) Sp1 sites (three) frequently found TATA-less promoters. DNase footprinting pattern promoter region crude rat liver nuclear extracts showed least seven regions protein binding nuclease protection (P1-P7). DNase protected regions contained consensus nucleotide sequences recognized GATA-1, Sp1, IgNF-A, Lva, bicoid Q9, NF-kB, HNF-5, H4TF-1, WAP5, ADH transription factors. Transient expression chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) suggested possible presence negative elements located within sequence -2316 -930, whereas deletion constructs containing -929 +32 -98 +32 DNA sequences showed approximately 7- 20-fold increases CAT activity basal CAT activity. Additional studies indicated presence orientation-dependent cis element (or elements) within region -282 -397 acts enhancer repressor upon heterologous thymidine kinase promoter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
