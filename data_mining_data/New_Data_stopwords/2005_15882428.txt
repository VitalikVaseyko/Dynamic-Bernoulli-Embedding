 Myxospore formation myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca uncoupled cooperative development i.e. fruiting body formation, low concentrations indole. Two putative indole receptor proteins isolated capacity bind indole identified pyruvate kinase (PK) aldehyde dehydrogenase. PK activity Stigmatella crude extracts stimulated indole. Cloning PK gene (pykA) construction pykA disruption mutant strikingly revealed PK essential multicellular development: Fruiting body formation abolished mutant strain indole-induced spore formation delayed. developmental defects could complemented insertion pykA gene mtaB locus Stigmatella genome excluding polar effects pykA disruption.
