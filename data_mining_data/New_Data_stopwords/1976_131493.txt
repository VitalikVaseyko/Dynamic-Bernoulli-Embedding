 Concentrations key metabolites determined carp white muscle exercise maximal activity. found concentration ATP decreases 65%, ADP decreases slightly, AMP remains unchanged. Consequently, level free adenylate pool decreases. Simultaneously increase concentration IMP NH4+. increase IMP level decrease adenylate pool essentially 1:1 stoichiometry, result showing adenylate pool decreased reaction catalyzed 5'-AMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6.). exercise increase levels glucose-6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate that, along decrease ATP levels, account increase glycolytic flux activation phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase.
