 Bifidobacteria show great diversity cell surface architecture may influence physicochemical properties bacterial cell strain specific properties. immunomodulatory role bifidobacteria extensively studied, however studies immunoreactivity protein molecules limited. Here, compared six different methods protein isolation purification report identification immunogenic immunoreactive protein two human Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum strains. evaluated potential immunoreactive properties proteins employing polyclonal sera obtained germ free mouse, rabbit human. protein yield isolation method-dependent reactivity proteins detected SDS-PAGE Western blotting heterogeneous varied different serum samples. proteins highest immunoreactivity isolated, purified sequenced. Among immunoreactive proteins identified enolase, aspartokinase, pyruvate kinase, DnaK (B. longum ssp. longum CCM 7952) sugar ABC transporter ATP-binding protein, phosphoglycerate kinase, peptidoglycan synthethase penicillin-binding protein 3, transaldolase, ribosomal proteins glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (B. longum ssp. longum CCDM 372).
