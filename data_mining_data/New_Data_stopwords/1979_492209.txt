 incidence elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activities compared 20 definite carriers Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 47 possible carriers, 42 female controls. adult age regarded variable, 70% definite carriers elevated PK, 55% elevated CK, 75% elevated PK elevated CK both, 38% possible carriers elevated PK, 19% elevated CK, 40% elevated PK elevated CK both. detection efficiency CK test influenced age subjects: upper normal limit serum CK adult controls minimum 21 35 years age, CK activity carriers declined elevated normal levels increasing age. considerations, 70% definite carriers elevated CK 80% elevated PK and/or CK; 34% possible carriers elevated CK 43% elevated PK and/or CK. basis PK CK measurements, 16 24 possible carrier mothers likely DMD carriers, implying 8 non-carrier mothers new mutant sons.
