 genome unicellular, euryhaline cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 encodes 3200 proteins. Transcripts detected nearly annotated open reading frames global transcriptomic analysis Next-Generation (SOLiD) sequencing cDNA. cDNA samples sequenced, approximately 90% mapped sequences derived 16S 23S ribosomal RNAs approximately 10% sequences derived mRNAs. cells grown photoautotrophically standard conditions [38 degrees C, 1% (v/v) CO(2) air, 250 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)], highest transcript levels (up 2% total mRNA abundantly transcribed genes; e.g., cpcAB, psbA, psaA) generally derived genes encoding structural components photosynthetic apparatus. High-light exposure 1 h caused changes transcript levels genes encoding proteins photosynthetic apparatus, Type-1 NADH dehydrogenase complex ATP synthase, whereas dark incubation 1 h resulted global decrease transcript levels photosynthesis-related genes increase transcript levels genes involved carbohydrate degradation. Transcript levels pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase complex decreased sharply cells incubated dark. dark anoxic (fermentative) conditions, transcript changes indicated global decrease transcripts respiratory proteins suggested cells employ alternative phosphoenolpyruvate degradation pathway via phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (ppsA) pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (nifJ). Finally, data suggested apparent operon involved tetrapyrrole biosynthesis fatty acid desaturation, acsF2-ho2-hemN2-desF, may regulated oxygen concentration.
