 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) purified apparent homogeneity insect trypanosomatid, Crithidia fasciculata, member primitive eukaryotic group contain mitochondria. Separation purified PDC SDS-PAGE yielded five bands 70 (p70), 60 (p60), 55, 46 36.5 kDa, appeared correspond dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase binding protein (E3BP), dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2), E3, E1 alpha E1 beta, respectively. purified complex exhibit endogenous PDHa kinase activity. p70 much less abundant p60. Polyclonal antisera raised p70 cross-react p60, antisera raised p60 cross-react p70, suggesting p60 arise p70 proteolysis. p70 p60 contained similar amino terminal sequences. sequences contained MPALSP motif similar sequences present E3BP E2 sources. Incubation purified PDC [2-14C]pyruvate absence CoA resulted acetylation p70 p60, suggesting proteins contained lipoyl domains, specific incorporation label p70 significantly greater p60. Limited proteolysis acetylated complex trypsin yielded two major fragments derived p60 35 30 kDa, corresponding E2L E2I, one major acetylated fragment 58 kDa derived p70. Therefore, results suggest p70 E3BP given apparent M(r) degree acetylation, contains multiple lipoyl domains.
