 Male Wistar rats starved refed diets containing either 40% carbohydrate monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, invert sugar) disaccharides (maltose, sucrose), 42.2% carbohydrate glucose. Induction various liver enzymes changes total liver lipid levels different dietary sugars studied. Liver enzymes measured included glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), malic enzyme (ME), phosphofructokinase (PFK), L-alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (LalphaGPD), pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate cleavage enzyme (CCE), acetyl CoA carboxylase (AcCoAC), fatty acid synthetase (FAS). responses enzyme activity diets containing glucose invert sugar used basal response. Enzyme responses refeeding carbohydrate diets fell three categories: (1) enzyme activity increased disaccharide configuration carbohydrate fructose (G6PD, PK, CCE, AcCoAC, FAS); (2) enzyme activity increased disaccharide configuration carbohydrate (6PGD, ME); (3) enzyme activity increased fructose (PFK, LalphaGPD). Total liver lipid level increased disaccharide configuration carbohydrate fructose. Refeeding diets containing equal molar amounts glucose maltose abolish disaccharide effect. data indicate disaccharide configuration maltose sucrose may effect gastrointestinal level, causes increased induction certain enzymes liver.
