 Notch plays critical roles cell fate decisions tumorigenesis. Notch receptor engagement initiates signaling cascades include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/target rapamycin (TOR) pathway. Mammalian TOR (mTOR) participates two distinct biochemical complexes, mTORC1 mTORC2, relationship mTORC2 physiological outcomes dependent Notch signaling unknown. study, report contributions mTORC2 thymic T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) driven Notch. Conditional deletion Rictor, essential component mTORC2, impaired Notch-driven proliferation differentiation pre-T cells. Furthermore, NF-kappaB activity depended integrity mTORC2 thymocytes. Active Akt restored NF-kappaB activation, normal rate proliferation, differentiation Rictor-deficient pre-T cells. Strikingly, mTORC2 depletion lowered CCR7 expression thymocytes leukemic cells, accompanied decreased tissue invasion delayed mortality T-ALL driven Notch. Collectively, findings reveal roles mTORC2 promoting thymic cell development T-ALL indicate mTORC2 crucial Notch signaling regulate Akt NF-kappaB.
