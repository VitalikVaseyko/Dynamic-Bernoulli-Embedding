 paper presents effects combined exposure (noise, dust, nitrogen oxides) health condition industrial workers, special regard red blood cell metabolism. 208 male industrial plant workers average age 38.5 +/- 8.27 years average work period 14.7 +/- 8.22 years examined. statistically significant increase methemoglobin level detected well changes erythrocyte metabolism terms increased activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase vitro production lactic acid erythrocytes. observed changes indicate influence exposure nitrogen oxides resulting cellular adaptation unfavourable working conditions (activation pentose cycle final stage anaerobic glycolysis cycle).
