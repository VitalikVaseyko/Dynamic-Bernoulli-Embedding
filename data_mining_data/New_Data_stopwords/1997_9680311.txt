 Ubiquitous upstream stimulatory factors (USF1, USF2a USF2b) members basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper family transcription factors shown involved transcriptional response L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene glucose. understand mechanisms action USF2 isoforms, initiated series co-transfection assays deletion mutants Ga14-USF2 fusions. transactivating efficiency different native mutant factors determined similar DNA binding activity. found that: (i) exons 3- 5-encoded regions activation domains, (ii) modulator domain encoded exon 4 could necessary additive action, (iii) hexapeptide encoded first 5' codons exon 6 indispensable transmitting activation due exon 3- exon 5-encoded domains transcriptional machinery. Therefore, USF2 presents modular structure mediates transcriptional activation thanks two non-autonomous activation domains dependent auxiliary peptide expressing activating potential.
