 Yeast hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) catalyzes phosphorylation pyranose furanose analogs glucose 0.01-125% rate glucose. enzyme highly tolerant structural changes C-2 C-3 glucopyranose less tolerant changes C-1 C-4. Preparative phosphorylations performed compounds 0.01-100% activity glucose, using phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase regenerate ATP. effects inhibition hexokinase phosphoenolpyruvate acetyl phosphate cofactor regeneration discussed.
