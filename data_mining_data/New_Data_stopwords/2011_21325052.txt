 Although aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) hallmark cancer, key questions, including when, how, cancer cells become highly glycolytic, remain less clear. largely unknown regulatory mechanism, rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform exclusively expressed embryonic, proliferating, tumor cells, plays essential role tumor metabolism growth. receptor tyrosine kinase/PI3K/AKT/mammalian target rapamycin (RTK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling cascade frequently altered pathway cancer, explored potential role cancer metabolism. identified mTOR central activator Warburg effect inducing PKM2 glycolytic enzymes normoxic conditions. PKM2 level augmented mouse kidney tumors due deficiency tuberous sclerosis complex 2 consequent mTOR activation, reduced human cancer cells mTOR suppression. mTOR up-regulation PKM2 expression hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha)-mediated transcription activation, c-Myc-heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs)-dependent regulation PKM2 gene splicing. Disruption PKM2 suppressed oncogenic mTOR-mediated tumorigenesis. Unlike normal cells, mTOR hyperactive cells sensitive inhibition mTOR glycolysis. Dual suppression mTOR glycolysis synergistically blunted proliferation tumor development mTOR hyperactive cells. Even though aerobic glycolysis required breach senescence immortalization transformation, frequently deregulated mTOR signaling multistep oncogenic processes could contribute development Warburg effect many cancers. Components mTOR/HIF1alpha/Myc-hnRNPs/PKM2 glycolysis signaling network could targeted treatment cancer caused aberrant RTK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
