 objective determine increased glycolytic enzyme capacity accommodates rapid glycolysis, leads inferior pork color water-holding capacity. Progeny HAL-1843 free Duroc (n=16) Pietrain (n=16) sires harvested 2-week period. Coupled enzyme assays used quantify total capacity pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) sarcoplasmic fractions crude homogenates longissimus muscle (LM), respectively. Capacity PK correlated LM pH (20, 45, 180 min 24 h), purge, drip loss, CIE L* (P > 0.2). However, PFK capacity inversely related fluid loss (P<0.05). finding unexpected, may result PFK becoming partially denatured inactivated 20 min postmortem samples undergo rapid pH decline. data indicate lighter pork color reduced water-holding capacity associated increase capacity enzymes catalyze regulated steps glycolysis.
