 dUDP analogue, 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-(alpha,beta-imido)diphosphate (dUPNP) synthesized. corresponding triphosphate analogue (dUPNPP) prepared enzymic phosphorylation dUPNP using enzyme pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate phosphate donor. method successful phosphorylating imidodiphosphate analogue 2'-deoxythymidine (dTPNP) 2'-deoxythymidine 5'-(alpha, beta-imido)triphosphate (dTPNPP), contradiction previous report. properties dUPNPP tested using enzyme dUTPase Escherichia coli. enzyme, crucial role nucleotide metabolism, strictly specific substrate (dUTP) catalyzes hydrolysis alpha, beta-bridge, resulting dUMP pyrophosphate. Replacement alpha, beta-bridging oxygen dUTP imido group resulted nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue potent competitive inhibitor dUTPase (Ki = 5 microM). analogue prepared (dUPNPP) may utilized crystallographic studies active site dUTPase provide knowledge specific interactions involved substrate binding parental compound design dUTPase inhibition medical purposes.
