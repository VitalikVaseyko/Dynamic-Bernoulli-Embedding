 BACKGROUND: Even presence oxygen, malignant cells often highly depend glycolysis energy generation, phenomenon known Warburg effect. One strategy targeting metabolic phenotype glucose restriction administration high-fat, low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet. conditions, ketone bodies generated serving important energy source least non-transformed cells. METHODS: investigate whether ketogenic diet might selectively impair energy metabolism tumor cells, characterized vitro effects principle ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate rat hippocampal neurons five glioma cell lines. vivo, non-calorie-restricted ketogenic diet examined orthotopic xenograft glioma mouse model. RESULTS: ketone body metabolizing enzymes 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 2 (BDH1 2), 3-oxoacid-CoA transferase 1 (OXCT1) acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) expressed mRNA protein level glioma cell lines. However, activation hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) pathway observed glioma cells, consistent absence substantial 3-hydroxybutyrate metabolism subsequent accumulation succinate. Further, 3-hydroxybutyrate rescued hippocampal neurons glucose withdrawal-induced cell death protect glioma cell lines. hypoxia, mRNA expression OXCT1, ACAT1, BDH1 2 downregulated. vivo, ketogenic diet led robust increase blood 3-hydroxybutyrate, alter blood glucose levels improve survival. CONCLUSION: summary, glioma cells incapable compensating glucose restriction metabolizing ketone bodies vitro, suggesting potential disadvantage tumor cells compared normal cells carbohydrate-restricted ketogenic diet. investigations necessary identify co-treatment modalities, e.g. glycolysis inhibitors antiangiogenic agents efficiently target non-oxidative pathways.
