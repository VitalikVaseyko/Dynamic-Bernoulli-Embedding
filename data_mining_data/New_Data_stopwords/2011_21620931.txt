 Elementary-mode analysis powerful method detecting potential pathways metabolic network computing associated molar yields. Metabolic pathways interpreted different strategies organisms. Thus, methods Evolutionary Game Theory employed. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), usually assumed molar yields relevant products (such biomass ATP) maximized evolution. questioned game-theoretical grounds. particular, situations characterized Prisoner's Dilemma, maximization flux line maximization yield. conditions (that is, parameter values maximal velocities), Harmony game result, two maximization criteria give result. Here, analyse optimal situations varying conditions. particular, consider case cell allocate certain amount protein several enzymes varying distribution model linear programming problem rates also maximal velocities variable. turns case low moderate synthesis costs enzymes high-yield pathway, maximizing pathway flux line maximizing molar yield case high costs, not. may explain observation many cells striated muscle cells, tumour cells, activated lymphocytes several yeasts reallocate protein away glycolytic enzymes towards TCA cycle respiratory chain enzymes, spite higher efficiency respiration. provides straightforward explanation Warburg effect tumour cells.
