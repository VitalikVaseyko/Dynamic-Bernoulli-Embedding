 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency detected boy dutch origin. Immunologic, electrophoretic, kinetic studies enzymes propositus members family demonstrated boy heterozygote two different mutant PK alleles. mutant enzyme, mother heterozygote, characterized lower immunologic specific activity, decreased affinity substrate phospho-enol-pyruvate, loss homotropic interactions toward substrate, increased affinity toward allosteric inhibitor MgATP2-, decreased affinity activator fructose-1,6-diphosphate, lowered pH optimum. Electrophoresis, Km app. MgADP, reactivity toward purine nucleotide substrate analogues normal. mutant enzyme father heterozygote characterized decreased affinity substrate phospho-enol-pyruvate loss homotropic interactions toward substrate. parameters mentioned normal. use kinetic study mutant enzymes detection heterozygotes discussed.
