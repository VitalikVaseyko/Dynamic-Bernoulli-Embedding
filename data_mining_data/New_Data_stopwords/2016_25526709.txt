 Pyruvate oxidation defects (PODs) among frequent causes deficiencies mitochondrial energy metabolism represent substantial subset classical mitochondrial diseases. PODs caused deficiency subunits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) also various disorders recently described whole pyruvate oxidation route including cofactors, regulation PDHC mitochondrial pyruvate carrier. patients 2000 July 2014 patients identified systematic survey literature 1970 July 2014 pyruvate oxidation disorder genetically proven defect included study (n=628). defects 74.2% (n=466) belong PDHC subunits, 24.5% (n=154) cofactors, 0.5% (n=3) PDHC regulation 0.8% (n=5) mitochondrial pyruvate import. PODs underestimated field mitochondrial diseases diagnostic centres include biochemical investigations PDHC routine analysis. Cofactor transport defects missed, pyruvate oxidation measured intact mitochondria routinely. Furthermore deficiency X-chromosomal PDHA1 biochemically missed depending X-inactivation pattern. reflected increasing number patients diagnosed recently genetic high throughput screening approaches. PDHC deficiency including regulation import affect mainly glucose dependent central peripheral nervous system skeletal muscle. PODs combined enzyme defects affect also organs like heart, lung liver. spectrum clinical presentation PODs still expanding. PODs therapeutically interesting group mitochondrial diseases since bypassed ketogenic diet treated cofactor supplementation. PDHC kinase inhibition, chaperone therapy PGC1alpha stimulation still matter investigations.
