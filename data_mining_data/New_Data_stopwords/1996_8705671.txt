 Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type (APS I) associated chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. characterize antibody responses subgroup Candida albicans infections, screened candidal cDNA expression library patient sera found four cDNA clones encoding immunopositive proteins enolase, heat shock protein 90, pyruvate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase. reactivity antigens studied immunoprecipitation assays vitro-transcribed -translated proteins. Analysis sera 44 APS patients showed highest antibody reactivity found enolase (80% patients reactive), significant serological responses also found heat shock protein 90 (67%), pyruvate kinase (62.5%), alcohol dehydrogenase (64%). Overall, 95.5% patients detectable antibodies least one proteins. cDNAs enolase heat shock protein 90 also expressed Escherichia coli studied immunoblotting. Again, 84% sera reacted enolase, whereas 44% sera reacted heat shock protein 90. good correlation two methods found enolase (r = 0.86; n = 58; P < 0.001) heat shock protein 90 (r = 0.71; n = 56; P < 0.001). results indicate four abundant candidal proteins major antigens used accurate markers candidiasis APS patients. immunoprecipitation assay described particularly useful rapid analysis large number samples.
