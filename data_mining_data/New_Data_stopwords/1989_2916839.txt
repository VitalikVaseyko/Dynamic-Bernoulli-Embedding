 Pyruvate kinase green alga Selenastrum minutum consists two isoforms (PK1 PK2) separable Q-Sepharose chromatography. two isoforms highly purified respective final specific activities 42 23 (mumol pyruvate produced/min)/mg protein. Purification steps included salt fractionation, anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, gel filtration chromatography. final enzyme preparations differ significantly physical immunological properties. PK1 heat labile completely inactivated following reaction N-ethylmaleimide. contrast, PK2 heat-stable partially inactivated following N-ethylmaleimide treatment. PK1 appears homotetrameric native molecular mass 240 kDa, whereas PK2 appears homodecameric native molecular mass approximately 590 kDa. antigenic reaction final PK preparations rabbit antiserum prepared homogeneous germinating castor bean endosperm cytosolic pyruvate kinase tested immunoprecipitation Western blotting. two algal pyruvate kinases immunologically unrelated PK2 cross-reacts cytosolic pyruvate kinase antibodies. data indicate S. minutum pyruvate kinase isoforms, PK1 PK2, interconvertible forms protein, probably represent chloroplastic cytosolic isozymes, respectively.
