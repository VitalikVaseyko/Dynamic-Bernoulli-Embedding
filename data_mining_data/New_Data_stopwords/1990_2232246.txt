 Pyruvate kinase (PK), important glycolytic enzyme, two genes per haploid genome mammals gene encodes two isozymes. L gene produces L- R-types using alternative promoters. gene generates M1- M2-types alternative RNA splicing. Expression PK isozymes tissue-specific regulated developmentally. Carcinogenesis apparently reverses developmental process. Expression L-type regulated dietary hormonal factors. regulations occurred post-transcriptional well transcriptional levels. transcription hepatic L-type PK stimulated insulin inhibited glucagon. insulin action requires ongoing protein synthesis metabolism glucose, enhanced glucocorticoid. Dietary fructose also stimulates expression L-type liver, kidney, small intestine, mechanism dependent tissues, plasma insulin levels case liver. normal liver, fructose induction explained stimulation gene transcription. hand, fructose acts mainly post-transcriptional level diabetic liver tissues. fructose effects attributable common metabolite(s) fructose glycerol. Studies transgenic mice indicate 5'-flanking region -3 kb L-type PK gene contains cis-acting elements responsible insulin regulation tissue-specific expression L-type. analysis using transient expression assay revealed presence multiple elements necessary expression L-type hepatocytes region -170b.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
