 several advantages use progress curves analyze kinetic properties enzymes studies still rely rate measurements. One reasons may progress curve analysis relies enzyme reactants completely stable assay conditions. method described relaxes requirement allows progress curve analysis applied unstable enzymes. procedure based combination numerical integration non-linear regression fit rate equations progress curve data. analysis verified using simulated data illustrated application reaction catalyzed alkaline phosphatase, measured presence 10 mM EGTA half-life 3 1/2 min. method may also applied experimental systems development time reveals important properties analytical solution underlying model known. extension illustrated two systems: coupled reactions catalyzed pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase conditions enzymes similar activity; transient-state kinetics reaction catalyzed glutamate dehydrogenase.
