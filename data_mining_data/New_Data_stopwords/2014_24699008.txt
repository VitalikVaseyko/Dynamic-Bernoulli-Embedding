 UNLABELLED: study revisited (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake relationship hypoxia various tumor models. METHODS: generated peritoneal carcinomatosis subcutaneous xenografts colorectal cancer HT29, breast cancer MDA-MB-231, non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell lines nude mice. partial oxygen pressure (pO2) ascites fluid measured. (18)F-FDG accumulation detected digital autoradiography related tumor hypoxia visualized pimonidazole binding glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) frozen tumor sections. RESULTS: Ascites pO2 0.90 +/- 0.53 mm Hg. Single cancer cells clusters suspended ascites fluid well submillimeter serosal tumors stained positive pimonidazole GLUT-1 high (18)F-FDG uptake. contrast, (18)F-FDG uptake significantly lower normoxic portion (little pimonidazole binding GLUT-1 expression) larger serosal tumors subcutaneous xenografts, statistically different liver. CONCLUSIONS: Glucose demand ((18)F-FDG uptake) severely hypoxic ascites carcinomas hypoxic portion larger tumors significantly higher normoxic cancer cells. Warburg effect originally obtained Ehrlich ascites carcinoma may apply normoxic cancer cells. findings may benefit better understanding (18)F-FDG PET oncology application.
