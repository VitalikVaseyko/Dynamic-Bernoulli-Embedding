 radiation therapy commonly used treating cancer, radiation resistance limit long-term control disease. study, investigated reprogramming energy metabolism radiosensitive radioresistant head neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) using preclinical matched model radiation resistance. investigation found radioresistant rSCC-61 cells: 1. display increased glucose uptake decreased fatty acid uptake; 2. deviate classical Warburg effect diverting glycolytic flux pentose phosphate pathway; 3. dependent glucose glutamine metabolism support growth; 4. decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation; 5. enhanced fatty acid biosynthesis increasing expression fatty acid synthase; 6. utilize endogenous fatty acids meet energy demands proliferation. Inhibition fatty acid synthase orlistat FASN siRNA resulted increased cytotoxicity sensitivity radiation rSCC-61 cells. results demonstrate potential combination therapy using radiation orlistat inhibitors lipid energy metabolism treating radiation resistance HNSCC.
