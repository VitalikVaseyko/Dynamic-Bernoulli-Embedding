 OBJECTIVE: investigate effects hypoxia glycolysis cultured rat hepatocytes. METHODS: Mixed gas different concentrations O(2), CO(2) N(2) prepared vitro culture normal rat hepatocytes. cell strains set A, B, C groups, observed 1, 2, 4, 8 16 hours hypoxia normal hepatocytes control. Biochemical methods employed determine activities key enzymes hepatocytic glycolysis hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) change content lactic acid (LA) culture fluid. RESULTS: (1) LDH activity rat hepatocytes increased significantly time points hypoxia B groups compared control group (P < 0.05), activity increased obviously C group since 2 hours hypoxia (P < 0.05). (2) HK activity cells group increased significantly 1, 2, 4 16 hours hypoxia B C groups increased obviously 1 hour compared control group (P < 0.05). cellular PFK activity group increased markedly 1 4 hours hypoxia B C groups increased evidently 4 hours hypoxia (P < 0.05). cellular PK activity three groups increased hypoxic time points (P < 0.05). (3) cellular LA content B groups began increase since 2 hours C group since 4 hours hypoxia increased along time lapse (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: hypoxia might initiate glycolysis.
