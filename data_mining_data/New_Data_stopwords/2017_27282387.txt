 metabolism reprogrammed neuronal differentiation unknown. found loss hexokinase (HK2) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) expression, together switch pyruvate kinase gene splicing PKM2 PKM1, marks transition aerobic glycolysis neural progenitor cells (NPC) neuronal oxidative phosphorylation. protein levels c-MYC N-MYC, transcriptional activators HK2 LDHA genes, decrease dramatically. Constitutive expression HK2 LDHA differentiation leads neuronal cell death, indicating shut-off aerobic glycolysis essential neuronal survival. metabolic regulators PGC-1alpha ERRgamma increase significantly upon neuronal differentiation sustain transcription metabolic mitochondrial genes, whose levels unchanged compared NPCs, revealing distinct transcriptional regulation metabolic genes proliferation post-mitotic differentiation states. Mitochondrial mass increases proportionally neuronal mass growth, indicating unknown mechanism linking mitochondrial biogenesis cell size.
