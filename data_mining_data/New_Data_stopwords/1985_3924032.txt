 Production butyrate holotrich protozoon Dasytricha ruminantium involves enzymes glycolysis, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, acetyl-CoA:acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA reductase, phosphate butyryltransferase butyrate kinase. Subcellular fractionation differential density-gradient centrifugation sucrose gradients indicated enzymes except pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase non-sedimentable 6 X 10(6) g-min. Butyrate kinase phosphate butyryltransferase associated large- small-granule fractions. Thus, although metabolic reactions necessary butyrate production proceed predominantly cytosol, hydrogenosomes play key role conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA.
