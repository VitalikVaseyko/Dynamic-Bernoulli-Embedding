 mitochondrial kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) recently received attention oncology due ability target glycolysis. However, DCA molecule exhibits poor bioavailability cellular uptake limited ability reach target mitochondria. overcome biases, synthesized novel DCA-loaded compounds. selection promising therapeutic molecule evaluated combining vitro assays, test antitumoral potential leukemic cells, preliminary characterization molecule stability vivo, mice. Among newly synthesized compounds, selected multiple DCA-loaded compound 10, characterized tertiary amine scaffold, exhibited enhanced (>30-fold) vitro antitumor activity respect DCA increased vivo stability. basis results, believe compound 10 considered preclinical evaluations treatment cancers and/or diseases characterized altered metabolic origin.
