 Myopathy among well documented disturbing adverse effects statins. underlying mechanism still unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction related coenzyme Q10 decline one proposed theories. present study aimed investigate mechanism atorvastatin-induced myopathy rats. addition, mechanism coenzyme Q10 protection investigated special focus mitochondrial alterations. Sprague-Dawely rats treated orally either atorvastatin (100mg/kg) atorvastatin coenzyme Q10 (100mg/kg). Myopathy assessed measuring serum creatine kinase (CK) myoglobin levels together examination necrosis type IIB fiber muscles. Mitochondrial dysfunction evaluated measuring muscle lactate/pyruvate ratio, ATP level, pAkt well mitochondrial ultrastructure examination. Atorvastatin treatment resulted rise CK (2X) myoglobin (6X) level graded degrees muscle necrosis. Biochemical determinations showed prominent increase lactate/pyruvate ratio decline ATP (>80%) pAkt (>50%) levels. Ultrastructure examination showed mitochondrial swelling disrupted organelle membrane. Co-treatment coenzyme Q10 induced reduction muscle necrosis well CK myoglobin levels. addition, coenzyme Q10 improved mitochondrial dysfunction parameters including mitochondrial swelling disruption. results presented model atorvastatin-induced myopathy rats proved mitochondrial dysfunction main contributor statin-myopathy pathophysiology.
