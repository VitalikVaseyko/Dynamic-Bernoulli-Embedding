 critical demand contemporary medicine gene expression markers areas human disease, early detection disease, classification, prognosis, response therapy. integrity circadian gene expression underlies cardiovascular health disease; however time-of-day profiling heart disease never examined. hypothesized time-of-day chronomic approach using samples collected across 24-h cycles analyzed microarrays bioinformatics advances contemporary approaches, includes sleep-time and/or wake-time molecular responses. proof concept, demonstrate value approach cardiovascular disease using murine Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) model pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy mice. First, microarrays novel algorithm termed DeltaGene used identify time-of-day differences gene expression cardiac hypertrophy 8 wks post-TAC. top 300 candidates analyzed using knowledge-based platforms, paring list 20 candidates, validated real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). Next, tested whether time-of-day gene expression profiles could indicative disease progression comparing 1- vs. 8-wk TAC. Lastly, since protein expression functionally relevant, monitored time-of-day cycling analogous cardiac proteins. approach generally applicable lead new understanding disease.
