 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Screening precancerous lesions important diagnosis treatment colorectal tumors. investigated M2-pyruvate kinase levels patients colorectal polyps carcinoma assessed factors affecting M2-pyruvate kinase levels. MATERIALS METHODS: Eighty-five patients undergone colonoscopic examination diagnosed neoplastic lesion included. Patients divided two groups according macroscopic diagnosis polyp carcinoma. According histopathological evaluation, specimens grouped nonneoplastic lesions, tubular adenoma, tubulovillous adenoma adenocarcinoma. M2-pyruvate kinase levels measured Tumor M2-pyruvate kinase ELISA kit. RESULTS: Mean M2-pyruvate kinase levels 76.1+/-57.73 (13.1-288.22) IU/ml. find correlation M2-pyruvate kinase levels age, gender, smoking, alcohol aspirin consumption colorectal cancer family history. relationship body mass index M2-pyruvate kinase level (p=0.022). carcinoma group highest levels M2-pyruvate kinase endoscopically histopathologically (p=0.009, p=0.019 respectively). M2-pyruvate kinase levels patients died significantly higher patients survived (p=0.001). Enzyme values significantly lower diabetic patients nondiabetics (p=0.04); chronic renal failure patients higher levels (p=0.045). CONCLUSION: Serum M2-pyruvate kinase levels may useful distinguishing malignant benign lesions colon may provide insight terms survival.
