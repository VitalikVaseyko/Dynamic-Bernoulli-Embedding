 RATIONALE OBJECTIVES: Cancer cells generate lactate normal cells aerobic hypoxic conditions-exhibiting so-called Warburg effect. However, relationship Warburg effect tumor metastatic potential remains controversial. intend investigate whether higher lactate reflects higher tumor metastatic potential. MATERIALS METHODS: used hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) compare lactate (13)C-labeling vivo mouse xenografts highly metastatic (MDA-MB-231) relatively indolent (MCF-7) human breast cancer cell lines. obtained kinetic parameters lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-catalyzed reaction three methods data analysis including differential equation fit, q-ratio fit, ratio fit methods. RESULTS: Consistent results three methods showed highly metastatic tumors exhibited smaller apparent forward rate constant (k(+) = 0.060 +/- 0.004 s(-1)) relatively indolent tumors (k(+) = 0.097 +/- 0.013 s(-1)). ratio fit generated greatest statistical significance difference (P = .02). significant difference reverse rate constant found two tumor lines. CONCLUSIONS: result indicates less metastatic breast tumors may produce lactate highly metastatic ones injected (13)C-pyruvate supports notion breast tumor metastatic risk necessarily associated high levels glycolysis lactate production. studies needed confirm whether much measured apparent rate constants affected membrane transporter activity whether primarily determined LDH activity.
