 Recently, described properties mutant (H142N) Escherichia coli succinyl coenzyme (CoA) synthetase His-142 alpha-subunit changed Asn (Luo, G.-X., Nishimura, J.S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20781-20785). mutant enzyme practically devoid ability catalyze overall reaction able catalyze half-reactions significant rates. Thus, phosphorylation ATP dephosphorylation ADP mutant enzyme occurred rates least 10 times greater wild type enzyme, dephosphorylation succinate plus CoA (succinyl-CoA formation) proceeded Vmax 10% wild type, change Km succinate little change Km CoA. present work, shown incubation 32P-labeled H142N ATP caused rapid depletion label enzyme incorporation radioactivity nucleotide species neither ATP ADP. reaction catalyzed comparatively negligible rates wild type enzyme. Analysis labeled product high pressure liquid chromatography 31P NMR revealed adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate (AP4). Incubation labeled H142N ATP analog beta,gamma-methylene adenosine triphosphate also gave product appeared corresponding tetraphosphate. reaction AP4 formed greatly stimulated addition phosphoenolpyruvate plus pyruvate kinase strongly inhibited ADP CoA plus succinate. results consistent binding ATP to, reaction with, phosphorylated succinyl-CoA synthetase form AP4. reaction, determined Km ATP turnover number phosphorylated enzyme 14.5 microM 0.024 s-1, respectively.
