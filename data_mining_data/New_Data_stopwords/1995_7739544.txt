 GCR1 gene product required maximal transcription yeast glycolytic genes growth yeast strains media containing glucose carbon source. Dominant mutations two genes, SGC1 SGC2, well recessive mutations SGC5 gene identified suppressors growth transcriptional defects caused gcr1 null mutation. wild-type mutant alleles SGC1 cloned sequenced. predicted amino acid sequence SGC1 gene product includes region substantial similarity basic-helix-loop-helix domain Myc family DNA-binding proteins. SGC1-1 dominant mutant allele contained substitution glutamine highly conserved glutamic acid residue within putative basic DNA binding domain. second dominant mutant, SGC1-2, contained valine-for-isoleucine substitution within putative loop region. SGC1-1 dominant mutant suppressed GCR1 requirement enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase gene expression. Expression yeast enolase genes reduced three- fivefold strains carrying sgc1 null mutation, demonstrating SGC1 required maximal enolase gene expression. Expression enolase genes strains carrying gcr1 sgc1 double null mutations substantially less observed strains carrying either null mutation alone, suggesting GCR1 SGC1 function parallel pathways activate yeast glycolytic gene expression.
