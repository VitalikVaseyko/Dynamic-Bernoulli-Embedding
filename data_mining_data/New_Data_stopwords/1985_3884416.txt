 Peripheral hyperinsulinaemia usually found conventionally treated Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients may deleterious metabolic effects. used hyperinsulinaemic model examine intermediary metabolism two key peripheral tissues, aorta muscle. Nine pigs immunized crystalline insulin. Subsequently, showed insulin-binding capacity 86.2 +/- 25.0 pmol/l fasting total serum insulin 3.9 +/- 3.1 nmol/l (control range 0.034-0.072 nmol/l), impaired glucose tolerance oral glucose tolerance testing, significantly elevated levels peripheral venous serum free insulin C-peptide, increased mean post-prandial free insulin/glucose ratios. immunized pigs showed marked elevation aorta muscle triglycerides compared control pigs (n = 15) similar levels non-esterified fatty acids. glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, malic enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase activities increased significantly (by 50%-300%) aorta muscle. Phosphofructokinase decreased tissues. Hexokinase increased muscle alone whereas pyruvate kinase significantly decreased aorta. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity significantly different aorta muscle. Thus insulin immunized pigs normal beta-cell function pronounced peripheral hyperinsulinaemia increased peripheral lipogenic activity. findings potentially important implications regard macrovascular disease diabetes.
