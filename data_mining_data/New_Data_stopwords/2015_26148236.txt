 Defects mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes, altered bioenergetics metabolic shift often seen cancers. show role dysfunction electron transport chain component cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) cancer progression. show genetic silencing CcO complex shRNA expression loss CcO activity multiple cell types mouse human sources resulted metabolic shift glycolysis, loss anchorage-dependent growth acquired invasive phenotypes. Disruption CcO complex caused loss transmembrane potential induction Ca2+/Calcineurin-mediated retrograde signaling. Propagation signaling includes activation PI3-kinase, IGF1R Akt, Ca2(+)-sensitive transcription factors also TGFbeta1, MMP16 periostin, involved oncogenic progression. Whole-genome expression analysis showed upregulation genes involved cell signaling, extracellular matrix interactions, cell morphogenesis, cell motility migration. transcription profiles reveal extensive similarity retrograde signaling initiated partial mitochondrial DNA depletion, although distinct differences observed signaling induced CcO dysfunction. possible CcO dysfunction biomarker cancer progression supported data showing esophageal tumors human patients show reduced CcO subunits IVi1 Vb regions previously shown hypoxic core tumors. results show mitochondrial electron transport chain defect initiates retrograde signaling. results suggest defect CcO complex potentially induce tumor progression.
