 E7 oncoprotein high risk human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16), etiologically associated uterine cervical cancer, potent immortalizing transforming agent. probably exerts oncogenic functions interacting altering normal activity cell cycle control proteins p21WAF1, p27KIP1 pRb, transcriptional activators TBP AP-1, metabolic regulators M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). show E7 short-lived protein degradation vitro vivo mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Interestingly, ubiquitin attach two internal Lysine residues E7. Substitution residues Arg affect ability protein conjugated degraded; contrast, addition Myc tag N-terminal C-terminal residue, stabilizes protein. Also, deletion first 11 amino acid residues stabilizes protein cells. Taken together, findings strongly suggest that, like MyoD Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transforming Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMPI), first ubiquitin moiety attached linearly free N-terminal residue E7. Additional ubiquitin moieties attached internal Lys residue previously conjugated molecule. involvement E7 many diverse apparently unrelated processes requires tight regulation function cellular level, controlled case ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.
