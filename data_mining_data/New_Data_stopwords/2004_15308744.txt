 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) integrases stably expressed determine intracellular trafficking. lentiviral integrase localized cell nuclei close association chromatin murine oncoretroviral integrase cytoplasmic. Fusions pyruvate kinase lentiviral integrases reveal transferable nuclear localization signals. intracellular trafficking determined instead transcriptional coactivator LEDGF/p75, required nuclear localization. Stable small interfering RNA expression eliminated detectable LEDGF/p75 expression caused dramatic, stable redistribution lentiviral integrase nucleus cytoplasm distribution MoMLV integrase unaffected. addition, endogenous LEDGF/p75 coimmunoprecipitated specifically lentiviral integrase. vitro integration assays preintegration complexes (PICs) showed endogenous LEDGF/p75 component functional HIV-1 FIV PICs. However, HIV-1 FIV infection replication LEDGF/p75-deficient cells equivalent control cells, whether cells dividing growth arrested. Two-long terminal repeat circle accumulation nondividing cell nuclei also equivalent LEDGF/p75 wild-type cells. Virions produced LEDGF/p75-deficient cells normal infectivity. conclude LEDGF/p75 fully accounts cellular trafficking diverse lentiviral, oncoretroviral, integrases main lentiviral integrase-to-chromatin tethering factor. lentiviral PIC nuclear import unaffected LEDGF/p75 knockdown, protein component functional lentiviral PICs. role HIV-1 integration site distribution merits investigation.
