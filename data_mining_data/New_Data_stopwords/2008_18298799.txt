 promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor suppressor protein accumulates PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), induce growth arrest, cellular senescence apoptosis. PML also localized cytoplasm, although function localization remains elusive. general property primary cancers high glycolytic rate results increased glucose consumption. However, mechanism cancer cells up-regulate glycolysis well understood. Here, shown cytoplasmic PML (cPML) directly interacts M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2), key regulator carbon fate. PKM2 determines proportion carbons derived glucose used glycolytic energy production. Over-expression PML-2KA mutant cytoplasm, generated mutagenesis nuclear localization signals PML, MCF-7 breast cancer cells suppressed PKM2 activity accumulation lactate. PKM2 exists either active tetrameric form high affinity substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) less active dimeric form low affinity substrate. Over-expression PML-2KA suppressed activity tetrameric form PKM2, dimeric form. findings suggest cPML plays role tumor metabolism interaction PKM2.
