 HISTORY CLINICAL FINDINGS: Three members one family (mother, aged 44 years; daughter, aged 23 years, son, aged 19 years) chronic haemolytic anaemia since infancy. three several blood transfusions year haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations low 5 g/dl due intermittent increases haemolysis. Despite unclear diagnosis three splenectomies: spleens enlarged 5-7 cm rib margin. splenectomy haemoglobin concentration rose 9-12 g/dl previously raised reticulocyte count 150-250/1000 rose 400-700/1000. None patients symptoms slight decrease exercise tolerance. admitted hospital evaluation. Physical examination unremarkable except slight jaundice well healed splenectomy scar. TESTS: three patients normochromic haemolytic anaemia (Hb 10-12 g/dl), bilirubin 2-3 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase activity 400-600 U/l). reticulocyte count raised 420-690/1000. pyruvate kinase (PK) activity normal slightly increased related Hb concentration. Reticulocytes healthy persons isolated density-gradient centrifugation samples could prepared different numbers reticulocytes: PK activity found dependent sample's reticulocyte count. three patients PK deficiency could, therefore, diagnosed taking account raised reticulocyte count. CONCLUSION: reticulocytes higher PK activity erythrocytes reticulocyte count must taken account assessing significance given value enzyme's activity.
