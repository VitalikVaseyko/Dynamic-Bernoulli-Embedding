 1. work utilized model uncomplicated abdominal surgery (laparotomy ether anaesthesia) delineate effects abdominal trauma glucose homoeostasis fed rat. 2. Regulation glucose production utilization investigated observing response administration glucose, insulin plus glucose 5-methylpyrazole 3-carboxylic acid. 3. Glucose administration suppressed hepatic glucose output assessed portal-venous concentration differences control surgically stressed rats. contrast, glycaemia increased lactaemia decreased latter group. Portal-venous concentrations differences lactate unaffected. 4. Surgery increased plasma fatty acid concentrations antilipolytic response glucose glucose plus insulin diminished. Post-operative increases fatty acid concentrations associated inhibition hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reversed insulin, indicating differential sensitivity adipose tissue liver hormone. 5. model surgical stress utilized, affecting extrahepatic glucose disposal, elicit depletion liver glycogen inactivation L-pyruvate kinase. 6. concluded initial response uncomplicated abdominal surgery involves carbohydrate conservation rather increased glucose production, effects decrease extrahepatic glucose uptake hepatic glucose oxidation.
