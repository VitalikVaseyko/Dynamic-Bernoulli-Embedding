 OBJECTIVE: variety calorie restriction diets fasting regimens popular among overweight people. However, starvation could result unexpected cardiovascular effects. Therefore, necessary evaluate short-term effects diets cardiovascular function, energy metabolism potential risk heart damage case myocardial infarction. objective present study investigate whether increased level glucose oxidation reduction fatty acid (FA) load fed state provides basis protection myocardial infarction experimental rat model ischemia-reperfusion. MATERIALS/METHODS: tested effects availability energy substrates metabolites heart functionality energy metabolism normoxic ischemia-reperfusion conditions. RESULTS: fasted state, heart draws energy exclusively FAs, whereas fed state, higher concentration circulating insulin ensures partial switch glucose oxidation, load FA heart mitochondria reduced. Herein, demonstrate ischemic damage hearts isolated Wistar rats diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats significantly lower fed state compared fasted state. CONCLUSIONS: Present findings indicate postprandial fed-state physiology, characterised insulin-activated glucose lactate utilisation, protective myocardial infarction. Energy metabolism pattern heart determined insulin signalling availability FAs. Overall, study suggests even overnight fasting could provoke aggravate cardiovascular events high-risk cardiovascular patients avoid prolonged fasting periods.
