 simple sensitive enzymatic method determination plasma serum fatty acids (FAs) described. method based acylation long chain FAs bacterial acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) producing equivalent amounts acyl-CoA AMP. AMP production measured using coupled reaction myokinase (MK), pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) allowing fluorinate detection NADH. Two moles NAD produced per mole FA acylated. Concentrations substrates enzymes kept low possible maintaining ACS reaction rate limiting. Addition fat-free human serum albumin (HSA) standards reduced initial reaction rates affect end-point fluorescence levels. Triton X-100 partly counteracted inhibition HSA. keep albumin concentration low, plasma serum samples diluted 1:400. Duplicate measurements plasma serum FA concentrations 0 2 mmol l-1 performed 5 microliters samples intra- inter-assay variation coefficients 1.7 4% respectively.
