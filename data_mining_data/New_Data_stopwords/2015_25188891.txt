 OBJECTIVE: Metabolic pathway alterations cancer thought dependent upon tumor type-specific oncogenic activation local nutrient oxygen supply disease progression. serous ovarian cancer, typical peritoneal spread disease caused shedding tumor cells abdominal cavity, often along ascites formation. much known metabolic features detached serous tumor cells. study, investigate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression GAPDH (glycolytic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) PKM2 (pyruvate kinase isoform M2), ATP5B (mitochondrial beta-F1-ATPase), heat shock protein 60 matched serous solid tumor corresponding ascites. MATERIALS/METHODS: Fresh samples solid tumor corresponding ascites prospectively collected 40 patients undergoing primary surgery suspected advanced ovarian cancer. these, 25 met study eligibility criteria, is, stage IIC IV disease serous (24) endometrioid (1) subtype solid ascites specimens containing 50% tumor cells good quality quantity mRNA yield. 2 patients (92%) type II disease. GAPDH, PKM2, ATP5B, HSP60 mRNA expressions assessed real-time polymerase chain reaction. marker, mRNA expression solid tumor pairwise compared corresponding expression ascites using Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank sum test. RESULTS: contrast hypothesis, mRNA expression analyzed metabolic markers HSP60 significantly differ matched solid tumor malignant ascites. CONCLUSIONS: results indicate expression changes genes related glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation prerequisite serous cancer cell survival detachment.
