 INTRODUCTION: Compared normal tissues tumors investigated far especially metastatic potential overexpress isoenzyme pyruvate kinase, pyruvate kinase type tumor M2 (TU M2-PK). monomeric structure, TU M2-PK function all. PATIENTS METHODS: Using enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) developed ScheBooTech (Wettenberg, Germany) measured concentration TU M2-PK EDTA-plasma 12 probands insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 91 patients suffering non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy. Moreover focused way compares metabolic markers HbA1c, glucose proteins. RESULTS: Among 12 patients afflicted insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 17%, 91 probands non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus many 19% samples raised cut-off 25 U/ml EDTA-plasma. correlation investigated parameters could found. CONCLUSION: study shows TU M2-PK EDTA-plasma patients diabetic nephropathy presents 38.8% "false-positive" data thus must questioned tumor marker.
