 order provide reference range normal red blood cell enzyme activities Thai, analyzed data 113 healthy non-anemic Thai people (55 males 58 females) age 1-42 years, normal pattern hemoglobin typing (HbA HbA2 less 3.5%). Hematological analysis performed using automated cell counter hemoglobin studies carried low pressure liquid chromatography. Owing high frequency alpha-thalassemia Thailand, cases MCV < 75 fl excluded study since cases likely heterozygotes alpha0-thalassemia. Cases reticulocytes > 2.5% excluded study since reticulocytes higher enzyme activity mature erythrocytes. Cases abnormal red blood cell morphology, spherocytes ovalocytes, also excluded. criteria applied select "normal" controls analysis. assayed eight red blood cell enzyme activities normal subjects: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), pyruvate kinase (PK), hexokinase (HK), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), phosphofructokinase (PFK), aldolase (ALD) phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). mean normal ranges (+/- SD) G6PD, 6PGD, PK, HK, GPI, PFK, ALD PGK 12.7 (+/-2.2), 10.7 (+/-1.3), 18.5 (+/-4.0), 1.5 (+/-0.4), 80.5 (+/-11.8), 11.8 (+/-2.1), 4.5 (+/-1.6) 370 (+/-43) IU/gHb, respectively. Age-dependent differences reference values enzyme activities summarized. red blood cell enzyme activities highest early childhood period slightly lower adult period. values clinically useful future reference.
