 M2 isoform pyruvate kinase, highly expressed tumor cells, known engage feed forward loop glycolysis master transcription factor HIF-1alpha. Gao co-authors recently showed dimeric PKM2 localizes nucleus highly proliferating cancer cells, regulates vivo growth acting protein kinase directly activating STAT3. STAT3 therefore novel player PKM2/HIF-1alpha feedback loop, since HIF-induced PKM2 activates STAT3 turn induces HIF-1alpha expression. findings profound implications understanding complex connections gene regulation, metabolism, survival proliferation cancer.
