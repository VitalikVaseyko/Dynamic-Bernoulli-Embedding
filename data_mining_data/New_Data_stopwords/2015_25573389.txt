 cDNA encoding Solanum tuberosum cytosolic pyruvate kinase 1 (PKc1) highly expressed tuber tissue cloned bacterial expression vector pProEX HTc. construct carried hexahistidine tag N-terminal position facilitate purification recombinant protein. Production high levels soluble recombinant PKc1 Escherichia coli possible using co-expression strategy chaperones GroES-GroEL. Purification protein Ni(2 +) chelation chromatography yielded single protein apparent molecular mass 58kDa specific activity 34unitsmg(-1) protein. recombinant enzyme optimum pH 6 7. relatively heat stable retained 80% activity 2min 75 degrees C. Hyperbolic saturation kinetics observed ADP UDP whereas sigmoidal saturation observed analysis phosphoenolpyruvate binding. Among possible effectors tested, aspartate glutamate effect enzyme activity, whereas alpha-ketoglutarate citrate potent inhibitors. tested phosphoenolpyruvate saturation kinetics, latter compounds increased S0.5. findings suggest S. tuberosum PKc1 subject strong control respiratory metabolism exerted via citrate tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates.
