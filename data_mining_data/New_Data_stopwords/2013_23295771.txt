 BACKGROUND: Mutations PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) cause early-onset recessive parkinsonism. PINK1 Parkin regulate mitochondrial quality control. However, PINK1 ablation Drosophila cultured mammalian cell lines affected mitochondrial function/dynamics opposite ways, confounding elucidation role PINK1 processes. OBJECTIVE: recently generated PINK1-deficient (PINK1-/-) mice reasoned primary cells mice provide physiological substrate study role PINK1 mammals investigate metabolic adaptations neuron-specific vulnerability PINK1 deficiency. METHODS RESULTS: Using real-time measurement oxygen consumption extracellular acidification, show basal mitochondrial respiration increased, maximum respiration spare respiratory capacity decreased PINK1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), membrane potential. addition, Warburg-like effect PINK1-/- MEF promotes survival abrogated inhibition glycolysis. Expression uncoupling protein-2 decreased PINK1-/- MEF striatum PINK1-/- mice, possibly increasing sensitivity oxidative stress. Mitochondria accumulate large foci PINK1-/- MEF, indicative abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and/or transport. Like PINK1-/- Drosophila, enlarged/swollen mitochondria accumulate three different cell types PINK1-/- mice (MEF, primary cortical neurons embryonic stem cells). However, mitochondrial enlargement greatest prominent primary cortical neurons also develop cristae fragmentation disintegration. CONCLUSION: results reveal mechanisms PINK1-related parkinsonism, show function PINK1 conserved Drosophila mammals studied primary cells, demonstrate PINK1 mutation affect mitochondrial morphology/degeneration cell type-specific manner, suggesting tissue-/cell-specific metabolic capacity adaptations determine phenotypes cellular vulnerability PINK1-/- mice cells.
