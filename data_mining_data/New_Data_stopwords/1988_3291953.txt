 Yeast cells, cell debris protein partitioning investigated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 8000/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) 10,000 system. Cells cell debris partition lower (PVA) phase pH range 4.8-7.5, 0.37 KCl pH 5.9. Protein partitioning pH-dependent PEG/PVA system PEG/dextran system, significant fraction total protein found interface lower pH values. Significant, rapid purification overproduced pyruvate kinase PEG/PVA system containing Blue Sepharose CL-6B particles demonstrated.
