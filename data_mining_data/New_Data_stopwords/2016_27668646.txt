 high rate glucose breakdown fingerprint cancer. Increased glycolysis allows tumour cells fulfil high energetic biosynthetic demands. Interestingly, however, rather metabolizing glucose oxidative phosphorylation pathway, cancer cells generally use glucose aerobic glycolysis. phenomenon known Warburg effect considered one fundamental forms metabolic reprogramming cancerogenesis. Changes rate glycolytic activity cancer cells caused mainly increased expression glycolytic enzymes consequence activation oncogenes loss tumour suppressors. addition, hypoxic tumour environment also triggers upregulation series genes involved glucose metabolism. Among metabolic enzymes modulated factors cancer cells 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFBs), family bifunctional enzymes control levels fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), essential activator glycolytic flux. Fru-2,6-P2 strongly activates glucose breakdown glycolysis allosteric modulation rate-limiting enzyme glycolysis, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). Thus far, many studies reported correlation aberrant PFKFB expression level grade tumour aggressiveness, directly indicates enzymes may play crucial role cancerogenesis. objective review highlight recent studies aberrant expression PFKFBs influence cancer progression.
