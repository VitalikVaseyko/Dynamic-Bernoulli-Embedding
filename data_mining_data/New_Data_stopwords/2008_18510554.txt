 search new drug targets human parasite Entamoeba histolytica, metabolic control analysis applied determine, experimentally, flux control distribution amebal glycolysis. first (hexokinase, hexose-6-phosphate isomerase, pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PP(i)-PFK), aldolase triose-phosphate isomerase) final (3-phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase pyruvate phosphate dikinase) glycolytic segments reconstituted vitro recombinant enzymes near-physiological conditions pH, temperature enzyme proportion. Flux control determined titrating flux enzyme component. parallel, glycolytic segments also modeled using rate equations kinetic parameters previously determined. flux control distribution predicted modeling determined reconstitution similar, kinetic interactions among reconstituted components experimentally revised unravel causes discrepancy. final segment, found 3-phosphoglycerate weakly competitive inhibitor enolase, whereas PP(i) moderate inhibitor 3-phosphoglycerate mutase enolase. first segment, PP(i) strong inhibitor aldolase nonessential mixed-type activator amebal hexokinase; addition, lower V(max) values hexose-6-phosphate isomerase, PP(i)-PFK aldolase induced PP(i) ATP inhibition. noted PP(i) metabolites absent 3-phosphoglycerate mutase enolase aldolase hexokinase kinetics experiments, present reconstitution experiments. incorporating modifications rate equations, modeling predicted values flux control distribution, flux rate metabolite concentrations similar experimentally determined. experimentally validated segment models allowed 'in silico experimentation' carried out, easy achieve vivo vitro systems. results predicted nonsignificant effect flux rate flux control distribution adding parallel routes (pyruvate kinase final segment ATP-dependent PFK first segment), much lower activity enzymes ameba. Furthermore, modeling predicted full flux-control 3-phosphoglycerate mutase hexokinase, presence low physiological substrate product concentrations. concluded combination vitro pathway reconstitution modeling enzyme kinetics experimentation permits comprehensive understanding pathway behavior control properties.
