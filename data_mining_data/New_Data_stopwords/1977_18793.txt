 deficient erythrocyte pyruvate kinase observed patient congenital non-spherocytic anaemia characterized following properties: low activity haemolysates, decreased thermal stability, slightly increased urea denaturation, high affinity PEP, poor FDP activation, normal ATP inhibition, decreased affinity ADP, normal pH optimal activity, presence abnormal slow-moving component layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. patient probably double heterozygous two different deficient mutants erythrocyte pyruvate kinase.
