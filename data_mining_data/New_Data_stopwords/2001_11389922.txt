 Differential 'fuel usage' proposed mechanism life-span extension caloric restriction (CR). Here, report effects CR, initiated weaning, metabolic enzyme gene expression 0, 1.5, 5, 12 h feeding 24-month-old mice. Plasma glucose insulin reduced approximately 20 80%. Therefore, apparent insulin sensitivity, judged glucose insulin ratio, increased 3.3-fold CR mice. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA activity transiently reduced 1.5 h feeding, 20-100% higher CR mice times. Glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA induced CR mice repressed control mice before, 5 h following feeding. Feeding transiently induced glucokinase mRNA fourfold control mice, slightly CR mice. Pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase activities reduced approximately 50% CR mice times. Feeding induced glutaminase mRNA, carbamyl phosphate synthetase glutamine synthase activity (and mRNA). approximately twofold higher CR mice. results indicate mice, CR maintains higher rates gluconeogenesis protein catabolism, even hours feeding. data consistent idea CR continuously promotes turnover replacement extrahepatic proteins.
