 balance oxidative nonoxidative glucose metabolism essential number pathophysiological processes. deleting enzymes affect aerobic glycolysis different potencies, examine modulating glucose metabolism specifically affects hematopoietic leukemic cell populations. find deficiency M2 pyruvate kinase isoform (PKM2) reduces levels metabolic intermediates important biosynthesis impairs progenitor function without perturbing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) deletion significantly inhibits function HSCs progenitors hematopoiesis. contrast, leukemia initiation transforming alleles putatively affecting either HSCs progenitors inhibited absence either PKM2 LDHA, indicating cell-state-specific responses metabolic manipulation hematopoiesis apply setting leukemia. finding suggests fine-tuning level glycolysis may explored therapeutically treating leukemia preserving HSC function.
