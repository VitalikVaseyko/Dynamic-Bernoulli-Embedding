 present study hypothesized myocardial adaptive phenotype mammalian hibernation involves rearrangement mitochondria bioenergetic pathways providing protective pattern states reduced metabolism low temperature. European ground squirrels (Spermophilus citellus) exposed low temperature (4+/-1 degrees C) divided two groups: (1) animals fell torpor (hibernating group) (2) animals stayed active euthermic 1, 3, 7, 12, 21days (cold-exposed group). Protein levels selected components electron transport chain ATP synthase heart increased prolonged cold acclimation (mainly day 7-21 cold exposure) hibernation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) also upregulated cold exposure hibernating conditions. phosphorylation state (Thr172) 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha increased early cold exposure (at day 1 3) along increased protein levels phosphofructokinase pyruvate dehydrogenase, whereas hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha protein levels showed changes response cold exposure hibernation. Hibernation also resulted protein upregulation three antioxidant defense enzymes (manganese copper/zinc superoxide dismutases glutathione peroxidase) thioredoxin heart. Cold-exposed hibernation-related phenotypes heart characterized improved molecular basis mitochondrial energy-producing antioxidant capacities achieved controlled manner. recapitulation adaptive mechanisms found hibernators could broad application myocardial protection ishemia/reperfusion improve hypothermic survival cold preservation hearts non-hibernating species, including humans.
