 Cancers cells strongly stimulate glycolysis glutaminolysis biosynthesis. Pyruvate derived glucose preferentially diverted towards production lactic acid (Warburg effect). Citrate censors ATP production controls strategic enzymes anabolic catabolic pathways feedback reactions. Mitochondrial citrate diffuses cytosol restore oxaloacetate acetyl-CoA. Whereas acetyl-CoA serves de novo lipid synthesis histone acetylation, OAA derived towards lactate production via pyruvate / vicious cycle reforming mitochondrial citrate. cycle allows cancer cells burn host's lipid protein reserves order sustain biosynthesis pathways. vitro, citrate demonstrated anti-cancer properties administered excess, sensitizing cancer cells chemotherapy. Understanding central role particular relevance development new strategies counteracting cancer cell proliferation overcoming chemoresistance.
