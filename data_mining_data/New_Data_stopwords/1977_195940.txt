 communication introduces nuclear relaxation approach estimation distance two paramagnetic metal ion sites metal-activated enzyme. method based existence exchange unpaired electron spin magnetizations two metals via energy-conserving concerted mutual spin flips arise time-dependent dipolar interactions electronic magnetizations. cross-relaxation electronic magnetizations depends inverse sixth power intermetal distance may, suitable conditions, affect longitudinal relaxation rate inner sphere water protons altering electron-proton dipolar correlation time latter dominated electron spin relaxation. technique applied estimate distance 5.2 +/- 0.9 Mn2+ Cr3+ pyruvate kinase-Mn2+-ATPCr3+ complex indicates existence van der Waals contact hydration spheres enzyme- nucleotide-bound metal ions.
