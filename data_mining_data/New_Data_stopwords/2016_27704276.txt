 Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), important w-3 fatty acid exhibits differential behavior cancer cells neural origin compared normal healthy astrocytes. Treatment C6 glioma SH-SY5Y cell lines primary astrocytes, representing neoplastic cells normal healthy cells respectively, 100 microM DHA 24 h showed significant loss cell viability cancer cells determined MTT assay, whereas primary astrocytes cultures unaffected. loss cell viability due apoptosis confirmed TUNEL staining caspase-3 activation cancer cells. Proteomic approach, employing 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE), difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE), MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis identified six proteins unlike astrocytes, differently altered cancer cells upon exposure DHA, suggesting putative contribution causing apoptosis cells. these, annexin A2, calumenin, pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, 14-3-3zeta downregulated aldo keto reductase-1B8 (AKR1B8) glutathione-S-transferase P1 subunit (GSTP1) showed upregulation DHA cancer cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown AKR1B8 GSTP1 inhibit DHA-induced apoptosis confirming role apoptotic process. Furthermore, western blot analysis identified upregulation PPARalpha MAP kinases, JNK p38 well increased ROS production selectively cell lines. Results suggest DHA selectively induces apoptosis neural cell lines regulating expression proteins activate multiple apoptotic pathways association excess ROS activated MAPKs promote cell death.
