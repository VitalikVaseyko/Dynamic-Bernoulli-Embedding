 Glucose metabolism preimplantation embryos traditionally viewed somatic cell viewpoint. Here, show gene expression early embryos similar rapidly dividing cancer cells. vitro-produced pig blastocysts subjected deep-sequencing, found express two gene variants ascribed importance cancer cell metabolism (HK2 M2 variant PKM2). Development monitored gene expression quantified additional embryos cultured low high O(2) (5% CO(2), 5% O(2), 90% N(2) vs. 5% CO(2) air). Development blastocyst stage two atmospheres similar, except low O(2) resulted total inner cell mass nuclei high O(2). 15 candidate genes selected involved glucose metabolism, TALDO1 PDK1 increased low O(2) environment. One paradigm used explain glycolysis low oxygen tension Warburg Effect (WE). predicts expression HK2 PKM2 M2 results slowing glucose metabolism TCA cycle, thereby forcing products glycolysis metabolized pentose phosphate pathway lactic acid. charging system apparently important early embryo redundant mechanisms present, is, fetal form PKM2 high levels PDK1. Here, set framework using describe glucose metabolism energy production preimplantation development.
