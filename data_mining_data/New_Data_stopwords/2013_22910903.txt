 Reactive oxygen species byproducts mitochondrial respiration thus potential regulators mitochondrial function. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDHK2) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thereby regulating entry carbohydrates tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. show PDHK2 activity inhibited low levels hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) generated respiratory chain. occurs via reversible oxidation cysteine residues 45 392 PDHK2 results increased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. H(2)O(2) derives superoxide (O(2)(.)), show conditions inhibit PDHK2 also inactivate TCA cycle enzyme, aconitase. findings suggest conditions high mitochondrial O(2)(.) production, may occur nutrient excess low ATP demand, increase O(2)() H(2)O(2) may provide feedback signals modulate mitochondrial metabolism.
