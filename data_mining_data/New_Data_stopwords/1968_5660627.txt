 1. Aerobically grown yeast high activity glyoxylate-cycle, citric acid-cycle electron-transport enzymes transferred medium containing 10% glucose. lag phase 30min. yeast grew exponentially mean generation time 94min. 2. enzymes malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase lost 45%, 17%, 27% 46% activity respectively lag phase. 3. growth commenced pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)-linked) NADPH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase increased activity, whereas aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)- NADP(+)-linked), alpha-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, fumarase, malate dehydrogenase, succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, NADH oxidase, NADPH oxidase, cytochrome c oxidase, glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)-linked), glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, isocitrate lyase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase decreased. 4. early stages growth loss activity aconitase, alpha-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, fumarase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase could accounted dilution cell division. lower rate loss activity isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)- NADP(+)-linked), glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)-linked), glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, NADPH oxidase cytochrome c oxidase implies continued synthesis, whereas higher rate loss activity malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase NADH oxidase means enzymes actively removed. 5. mechanisms selective removal enzyme activity control residual metabolic pathways discussed.
