 Ethyl pyruvate (EP) recently identified stable lipophilic derivative pyruvic acid significant antineoplastic activities. high mobility group box-B1 (HMGB1)-receptor advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) protein kinase B (Akt) pathways play crucial role tumorigenesis development many malignant tumors. tried observe effects ethyl pyruvate liver cancer growth explored effects hepatocellular carcinoma model. study, three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines treated ethyl pyruvate. MTT colorimetric assay used assess effects EP cell proliferation. Flow cytometry TUNEL assays used analyze apoptosis. Real-time PCR, Western blotting immunofluorescence demonstrated ethyl pyruvate reduced HMGB1-RAGE AKT pathways. results hepatoma orthotopic tumor model verified antitumor effects ethyl pyruvate vivo. EP could induce apoptosis slow growth liver cancer. Moreover, EP decreased expression HMGB1, RAGE, p-AKT matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP9) increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. conclusion, study demonstrates ethyl pyruvate induces apoptosis cell-cycle arrest G phase hepatocellular carcinoma cells, plays critical role treatment cancer.
