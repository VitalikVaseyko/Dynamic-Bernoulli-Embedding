 work, shown Ca2+-transport ATPase found microsomal fraction cerebellum use glucose 6-phosphate/hexokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate/phosphofructokinase ATP-regenerating systems. vesicles derived cerebellum able accumulate Ca2+ medium containing ADP either glucose 6-phosphate hexokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate phosphofructokinase added medium. Ca2+ uptake one components omitted medium. transport Ca2+ associated cleavage sugar phosphate. maximal amount Ca2+ accumulated vesicles fructose 1,6-bisphosphate system larger measured either glucose 6-phosphate low ATP concentration phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase. Ca2+ uptake supported glucose 6-phosphate inhibited glucose, fructose 6-phosphate. contrast, Ca2+ uptake supported fructose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibited fructose 6-phosphate, glucose. Thapsigargin, specific SERCA inhibitor, impaired transport Ca2+ sustained either glucose 6-phosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. proposed use glucose 6-phosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate ATP-regenerating system cerebellum Ca2+-ATPase may represent salvage route used early stages ischemia; could used energize Ca2+ transport, avoiding deleterious effects derived cellular acidosis promoted lactic acid.
