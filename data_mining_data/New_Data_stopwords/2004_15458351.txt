 vivo strategy apply activation effect acetyl-CoA phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) increase succinate production Escherichia coli studied. approach relies increased intracellular acetyl-CoA CoA levels overexpressing E. coli pantothenate kinase (PANK). results showed coexpression PANK PEPC, PANK PYC, improve succinate production compared individual expression PEPC PYC, respectively. intracellular acetyl-CoA CoA levels also measured, showed significant increase PANK overexpressed. Another effect observed decrease lactate production. least amount lactate produced PANK PEPC, PANK PYC, coexpressed. result showed increased competitiveness succinate pathway phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate nodes carbon flux, result reducing carbon flux toward lactate pathway. study also demonstrates feasible method metabolic engineering modulate enzyme activity vivo specific activators inhibitors.
