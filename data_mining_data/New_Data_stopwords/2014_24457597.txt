 Head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) important endemic disease Taiwan aggressive course dismal outcome. Dasatinib Bcr-bl Src kinase inhibitor potential HNSCC. recently disclosed EGFR degradation critical dasatinib-induced apoptosis. Here, demonstrate AMPK-dependent ER stress responsible event. Dasatinib induced ER stress mediated EGFR degradation c-cbl-dependent manner. AMPK activation induced dasatinib might due ATP decrease up-regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Furthermore, activation AMPK metformin sensitized dasatinib-induced vitro vivo anti-cancer effect. correlation AMPK activation EGFR expression seen HNSCC cells human tumor specimens. results disclose AMPK-dependent ER stress plays crucial role anti-cancer effect dasatinib HNSCC activation AMPK metformin might enhance dasatinib efficacy.
