 Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate kinase-encoding gene (PYK1) transformed back yeast using derivative multicopy vector, pJDB207. High levels PYK1 expression transformants limited least two separate mechanisms. Pyruvate kinase assays polysome analyses demonstrate translation PYK1 mRNA inhibited abundance increases. abundance PYK1 mRNA per gene copy also decreases copy number PYK1 gene increases. first report demonstrates eukaryotic glycolytic gene subject dosage limitation translational level.
