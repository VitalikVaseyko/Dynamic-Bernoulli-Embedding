 Dietary sphingolipids (SL) inhibit colon carcinogenesis, reduce serum cholesterol, improve skin barrier function considered "functional lipids". comparative determination effects SL different chemical compositions lipid metabolism related hepatic gene expression, Zucker fatty rats fed pure sphingomyelin (SM) animal origin glucosylceramide (GC) plant origin. 45 days, SM GC diets led significant reductions hepatic lipid plasma non-HDL cholesterol. SM GC diets decreased plasma insulin levels, whereas GC diet increased plasma adiponectin level. Hepatic gene expression analysis revealed increased expression adiponectin receptor 2 (Adipor2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4). However, expression stearoyl CoA desaturase (Scd1) significantly decreased. results suggest dietary SL, even different origins chemical compositions, may prevent fatty liver hypercholesterolemia improvement adiponectin signaling consequent increases insulin sensitivity.
