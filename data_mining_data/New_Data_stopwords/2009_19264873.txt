 Physical exercise ameliorates metabolic disorders type 2 diabetes mellitus obesity, molecular basis effects remains elusive. present study, found exercise up-regulates heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) skeletal muscle. address metabolic consequences gain HB-EGF function, generated mice overexpress protein specifically muscle. transgenic animals exhibited higher respiratory quotient wild-type mice indirect calorimetry, indicative selective use carbohydrate rather fat energy substrate. also showed substantial increases glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, glucose uptake skeletal muscle. changes accompanied increased kinase activity Akt skeletal muscle consequent inhibition Forkhead box O1-dependent expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene. Furthermore, mice high level transgene expression largely protected obesity, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, even maintained high-fat diet. results suggest HB-EGF produced contracting muscle acts insulin sensitizer facilitates peripheral glucose disposal.
