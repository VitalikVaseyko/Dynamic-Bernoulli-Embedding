 present paper, kinetic study made behavior moiety-conserved ternary cycle adenine nucleotides. system contains enzymes S-acetyl coenzyme synthetase, adenylate kinase pyruvate kinase, converts ATP AMP, ADP finally back ATP. L-Lactate dehydrogenase added system enable continuous monitoring progress reaction. cycle cannot work recycling substrate reaction medium AMP. mathematical model proposed whose kinetic behavior analyzed numerically integration nonlinear differential equations describing kinetics reactions involved, analytically steady-state conditions, good agreement experimental results obtained. data obtained showed threshold value S-acetyl coenzyme synthetase/adenylate kinase ratio, cycle stops recycling substrate accumulated AMP, never reaching steady state. addition, concept adenylate energy charge applied system, obtaining enabled values rate constants fixed adenylate energy charge value vice versa.
