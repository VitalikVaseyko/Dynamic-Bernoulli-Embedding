 present study investigated effects chronic food restriction (achieved limiting access food 2 h daily 8 weeks) activity active form pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) liver. Accelerated exaggerated activation hepatic PDH response meal, previously demonstrated occur within 10 days food restriction, demonstrated persist 4 8 weeks food restriction, despite food intake 50-60% controls. Activation hepatic PDH feeding rats subjected food restriction 4 weeks dependent continued food intake. consequence, hepatic PDHa activities food-restricted rats suppressed relative controls 19 h 24 h daily cycle. Curve-fitting second-order polynomial regression analysis demonstrated significant positive correlation hepatic PDHa activity lipogenic rate range PDHa activities observed 2 h feeding period. Increased lipogenesis feeding food-restricted rats expense hepatic glycogen synthesis deposition; measurement concurrent rates glycogenesis lipogenesis revealed simultaneous flux pathways, specific activation lipogenesis. accelerated re-activation hepatic PDH observed within 1 h feeding rats subjected 4 weeks food restriction facilitated failure 22 h interprandial fasting period induce stable increase hepatic PDH kinase activity. present study indicates differential regulation hepatic PDH kinase activity periods food withdrawal food-restricted rats starved/re-fed control rats. regulation occupies critical role determining rate activation hepatic PDH feeding. turn, increased activity hepatic PDHa feeding food-restricted rats bears close positive relationship hepatic lipogenic rate.
