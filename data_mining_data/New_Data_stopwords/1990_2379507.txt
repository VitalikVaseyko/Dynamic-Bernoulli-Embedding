 Crude lysosomal preparations non-cultured peritoneal rat macrophages shown separate high-density fractions rich cathepsin B H low-density fractions rich cathepsin L layered Percoll density gradients. Morphologically, heavy lysosome fractions found consist mainly lysosomes labeled gold particles anti-(cathepsin B, H L). light lysosome fractions contained lysosomes labeled anti-(cathepsin B, H L) many contaminants. addition, small vesicles labeled anti-(cathepsin L) detected fractions. Addition calf serum cultured macrophages induced increase density lysosomes dose-dependent time-dependent fashions. Cathepsins B, H L shifted heavy lysosome fractions following addition serum. Progressive increase fluorescence-labeled calf IgG heavy lysosome fractions addition suggests continuous entrance excess proteins lysosomes causes increase density. idea supported fact density lysosomes increased parallel accumulation horseradish peroxidase taken heavy lysosome fractions. Increase density lysosomes treatment ethyl(2S,3S)-3[(S)-3-methyl-1-(3-methyl-butylcarbamoyl)]oxirane-2- carboxylate (E-64-d) marked cells cultured serum-containing medium slight serum-deprived cells. However, level pyruvate kinase, autophagic sequestration marker heavy autolysosomes E-64-d-treated cells, much higher serum-deprived cells, indicating contribution heterophagic sequestration towards increase density lysosomes much greater autophagy.
