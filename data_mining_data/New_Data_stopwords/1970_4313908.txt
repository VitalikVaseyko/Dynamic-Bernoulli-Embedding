 Administration adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate theophylline produced testosterone-like induction hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase seminal vesicles orchidectomized immature rats. N(6)-O(2)'-dibutyryl analog cyclic nucleotide produced greater increases vesicular enzyme activities induced parent compound. observed enhancement key glycolytic enzymes hexose monophosphate shunt dehydrogenase significantly inhibited actinomycin cycloheximide. evidence indicates cyclic adenosine monophosphate may involved intermediary action androgenic hormones male accessory sex organs.
