 Acquired resistance imatinib mesylate increasing continued challenge treatment BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase positive leukemias well gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Stable isotope-based dynamic metabolic profiling (SIDMAP) studies conducted parallel development clinical testing imatinib revealed targeted drug effective controlling glucose transport, direct glucose oxidation RNA ribose synthesis pentose cycle, well de novo long-chain fatty acid synthesis. Thus imatinib deprives transformed cells key substrate macromolecule synthesis, malignant cell proliferation, growth. Tracer-based magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies revealed restitution mitochondrial glucose metabolism increased energy state reversing Warburg effect, consistent subsequent decrease anaerobic glycolysis. Recent vitro SIDMAP studies involved myeloid cells isolated patients developed resistance imatinib indicated non-oxidative ribose synthesis glucose decreased mitochondrial glucose oxidation reliable metabolic signatures drug resistance disease progression. also evidence imatinib-resistant cells utilize alternate substrates macromolecule synthesis overcome limited glucose transport controlled imatinib. main clinical implications involve early detection imatinib resistance identification new metabolic enzyme targets potential overcoming drug resistance downstream various genetic BCR-ABL-expression derived mechanisms. Metabolic profiling essential tool used predict, clinically detect, treat targeted drug resistance. need arises fact targeted drugs narrowly conceived genes proteins metabolic network inherently complex flexible activate alternative macromolecule synthesis pathways targeted drugs fail control.
