 Mammalian lactate dehydrogenase phosphofructokinase susceptible vitro superoxide (O2) hydroxyl (.OH) radicals pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting differential inactivation regulatory enzymes contributes metabolic disintegration stenoxic tissues transient hypoxia. Likewise, creatine kinase smooth muscle porcine ileum significantly reduced hypoxia-reoxygenation ex vivo 300 (+/- 18.2 SE, n = 8) 196 U.g wet wt-1 (+/- 16.7, P < 0.001, ANOVA). Conversely, arginine kinase, myocardium Limulus polyphemus, species tolerates anoxia days 2.9-fold less susceptible oxidative inactivation. examine whether preservation kinase function related euryoxic capacity, combination non-invasive 31P-NMR spectroscopy enzyme-linked assays used follow ATP phosphagen status hypoxia-reoxygenation porcine ileum smooth muscle, L. polyphemus myocardium, myocardium Argopecten irradians, scallop species tolerant hypoxia 24 h. Despite wide differences phylogeny, euryoxic capacity oxidative vulnerability phosphagen kinases, three tissues, phosphagen pool recovered concomitant ATP reoxygenation, thereby revealing competent kinase function. mammalian tissue, preservation kinase function facilitated 2400-fold excess enzyme activity.
