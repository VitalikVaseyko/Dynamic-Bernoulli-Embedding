 present study investigated: (1) contribution skeletal muscle mechanisms underlying impaired glucose homeostasis insulin sensitivity present dyslipemic rats fed sucrose-rich diet (SRD) long period time (2) effect fish oil parameters stable hypertriglyceridemia source fat (corn oil) diet replaced isocaloric amounts cod liver oil. results show increased triglyceride content gastrocnemius muscle impaired capacity glucose oxidation basal state euglycemic clamp. mainly due decrease active form pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHa) increase PDH kinase activities. Hyperglycemia, normoinsulinemia, diminished peripheral insulin sensitivity also found. Even though changes insulin levels, former metabolic abnormalities completely reversed source fat changed corn oil cod liver oil. data also suggest gastrocnemius muscle rats fed SRD extended period, increased availability oxidation lipid fuel, turn impairs glucose oxidation, contributes abnormal glucose homeostasis peripheral insulin insensitivity. Moreover, parallel effect insulin sensitivity, glucose, lipid homeostasis attained manipulation dietary fat (n-3) SRD suggests role n-3 fatty acid management dyslipidemia insulin resistance.
