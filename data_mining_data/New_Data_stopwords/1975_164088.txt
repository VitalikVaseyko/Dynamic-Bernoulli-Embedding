 5-Acetyl-4-methyl-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-imidazole-5'-phosphate reacts diphenylphospho chloridate forming asymmetrical pyrophosphate ester. turn reacts tri-n-butyl-ammonium phosphate yielding 5-acetyl-4-methyl-imidazole-riboside-5'-diphosphate tri-n-butylammonium pyrophosphate give nucleotide triphosphate. 5-Acetyl-4-methyl-imidazole-riboside-5'-pyrophosphate shows test pyruvate kinase reaction rate three times slower ADP; Km ADP. ATP analogue 10% effective ATP test hexokinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gloconate kinase. Adenylate kinase NAD" kinase show activity ATP replaced nucleotide-triphosphate-analogue. presence ATP analogue strongly inhibits reaction adenylate kinase.
