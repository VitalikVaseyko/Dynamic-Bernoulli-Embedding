 Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) responsible cancers attributable HPV infection naturally occurring variants HPV16 E6 oncoprotein predispose individuals varying risk developing cancer. Population studies us others demonstrated common Asian-American E6 (AAE6) variant higher risk factor cervical cancer E6 another common variant, European prototype (EPE6). However, complete understanding molecular processes fundamental epidemiological findings still lacking. previously published functional studies two E6 variants showed AAE6 higher immortalization transformation potential EPE6. Proteomic analysis revealed markedly different protein patterns variants, especially respect key cellular metabolic enzymes. Here, tested Warburg effect hypoxia signalling (hallmarks cancer development) plausible mechanisms underlying observations. Lactate glucose production enhanced AAE6-transduced keratinocytes, likely due raised levels metabolic enzymes, independent hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) activity. HIF-1alpha protein level activity elevated AAE6 hypoxic conditions, leading hypoxia-tolerant phenotype enhanced migratory potential. deregulation HIF-1alpha caused AAE6 variant's ability augment mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular related kinase signalling. present study reveals prominent underlying mechanisms AAE6's enhanced oncogenic potential.
