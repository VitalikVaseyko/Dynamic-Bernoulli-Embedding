 temporal relationship sucrose (Suc) accumulation carbon partitioning investigated developing sugarcane internodes. Radiolabeling studies tissue slices, contained Suc concentrations ranging 14 42% dry mass, indicated maturation coincided redirection carbon water-insoluble matter, respiration, amino acids, organic acids, phosphorylated intermediates Suc. evident cycle Suc synthesis degradation exists internodes. decreased allocation carbon respiration coincides decreased flux hexose pool. glucose fructose (Fru) concentrations significantly decrease maturation. phosphoenolpyruvate, Fru-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P), Fru-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2, 6-P2) concentrations decrease young older internodal tissue, whereas inorganic phosphate concentration increases. calculated mass-action ratios indicate ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, Fru-1,6-bisphosphatase reactions tightly regulated internodes, evidence found major changes regulation enzymes occur. pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase reaction apparent equilibrium internodes. Substrate availability might one prime factors contributing observed decrease respiration.
