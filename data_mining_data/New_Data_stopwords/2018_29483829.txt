 study, investigated whether metabolic alteration cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) occurs via miR-21 remodeling effect alteration pancreatic cancer cells. CAFs normal fibroblasts (NFs) isolated cultured. Glucose consumption lactic acid production tested, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate kinase m2 (PKM2), miR-21 expression examined. level glycolysis CAFs determined treatment miR-21 inhibitor. Primary miR-21-NC CAFs miR-21-inhibitor CAFs indirectly co-cultured BxPc-3 vitro, invasion capacity cells determined. aerobic oxidation index cancer cells expression succinodehydrogenase (SDH) fumarate hydratase (FH) assessed. Compared NFs, CAFs showed enhanced glucose uptake capacity, lactic acid production, elevated LDHA, PKM2, miR-21 expression. miR-21 inhibitor treatment, extent glycolysis CAFs reduced. indirect co-culture CAFs, oxidative phosphorylation SDH, FH, MCT expression increased BxPc-3 cells. co-culture miR-21-inhibitor-CAFs, oxidative phosphorylation invasion ability pancreatic cancer cells decreased. MiR-21 involved metabolic alteration CAFs affected development cancer cells. metabolic alteration may important mechanism microenvironment promotes tumor progression nonvascular manner.
