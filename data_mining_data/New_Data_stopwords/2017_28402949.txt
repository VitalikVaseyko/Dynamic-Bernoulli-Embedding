 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography become important tool detection, staging management many types cancer. Oncology application 18F-FDG bases knowledge increase glucose demand utilization fundamental features cancer. Pasteur effect, Warburg effect reverse Warburg effect used explain glucose metabolism cancer. 18F-FDG accumulation cancer reportedly microenvironment-dependent, 18F-FDG avidly accumulates poorly proliferating hypoxic cancer cells, low well perfused (and proliferating) cancer cells. Cancer heterogeneous complex "organ" containing multiple components, therefore, cancer needs investigated systems biology point view, proposed concept "systems molecular imaging" much better understanding systems biology cancer.This article revisits 18F-FDG uptake mechanisms, oncology applications role 18F-FDG PET "systems molecular imaging".
