 AIM: Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) characterised antimitochondrial antibody pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis (CNSDC). Pyruvate oxidation acetyl-CoA PDC key step glycolytic system. Oestrogen-related receptor-alpha (ERRalpha) functionally activated inducible coactivators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) Bcl-3. Moreover, PGC-1alpha-ERRalpha axis interrupts glycolytic metabolism upregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4), functionally inhibits PDC-E1alpha stimulates fatty acid oxidation. study, investigated PGC-1alpha-ERRalpha axis clarify PDC dysfunction CNSDC PBC. METHODS: expression PGC-1alpha, Bcl-3, ERRalpha, PDK4 PDC-E1alpha examined immunohistochemistry liver sections patients PBC controls. expression molecules, activity mitochondrial dehydrogenase PDC, alterations starvation, treatment used induce PGC-1alpha expression, examined cultured human biliary epithelial cells (BECs). RESULTS: nuclear expression PGC-1alpha, Bcl-3 ERRalpha exclusively observed CNSDC PBC. Moreover, expression PDK4 PDC-E1alpha enhanced CNSDC PBC. cultured BECs, amplification Bcl-3 PDK4 mRNAs reverse-transcription-PCR mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity markedly increased PDC activity decreased according upregulation PGC-1alpha. CONCLUSIONS: CNSDC PBC, activation ERRalpha-PGC-1alpha axis exclusively observed, suggesting interference PDC-related glycolytic function induction fatty acid degradation system. switching cellular energy system possibly associated pathogenesis CNSDC PBC.
