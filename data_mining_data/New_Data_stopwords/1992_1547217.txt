 recently shown monomer rat pituitary pyruvate kinase subtype M1 (p58-M1) cytosolic binding protein 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). understand role p58-M1 plays thyroid hormone action, examined regulation p58-M1 T3 GH3 cells. Expression p58-M1 evaluated metabolically labeling GH3 cells cultured regular medium, thyroid hormone depleted medium (Td medium), Td medium supplemented T3 (Td + T3 medium) followed immunoprecipitation. T3 stimulates expression p58-M1 2-fold. Analysis pulse-chase experiments indicates increased expression due increase stability p58-M1. Northern analysis mRNA prepared cells cultured regular, Td, Td + T3 medium demonstrates T3 increases accumulation cytoplasmic mRNA 2-fold. Nuclei cells cultured three conditions prepared, rates synthesis nascent nuclear RNA compared vitro transcription assay. Addition T3 stimulates rate transcription 2-fold. parallel identical magnitude increase transcription rate accumulation mRNA indicates T3 stimulates synthesis p58-M1 increasing transcriptional activity gene.
