 intracellular mechanisms regulation energy fluxes respiration contracting heart cells studied. this, investigated workload dependencies rate oxygen consumption metabolic parameters Langendorff-perfused isolated rat hearts.(31)P NMR spectroscopy used study metabolic changes transition perfusion glucose pyruvate without active creatine kinase system. experimental results showed transition perfusion glucose pyruvate increased phosphocreatine content stability level increased workloads. Inhibition creatine kinase reaction 15-min infusion iodoacetamide decreased maximal developed tension respiration rates factor two.(31)P NMR data analyzed mathematical model compartmentalized energy transfer, independent restrictions classical concept creatine kinase equilibrium. analysis experimental data model shows metabolic stability-constant levels phosphocreatine, ATP inorganic phosphate-at increased energy fluxes inherent property compartmentalized system. explains observed substrate specificity changes mitochondrial membrane potential. decreased maximal respiration rate maximal work output heart inhibited creatine kinase well explained rise myoplasmic ADP concentration. activates adenylate kinase reaction myofibrillar space mitochondria fulfil energy transfer signal transmission functions, usually performed creatine kinase. activity system, however, sufficient maintain high enough energy fluxes. Therefore, kinetic explanation decreased maximal respiration rate heart inhibited creatine kinase: i.e. kinetically induced switch efficient energy transfer pathway (PCr-CK system) non-efficient one (myokinase pathway) within energy transfer network cell conditions low apparent affinity mitochondria ADP vivo. may result significant decrease thermodynamic affinity compartmentalized ATPase systems finally heart failure.
