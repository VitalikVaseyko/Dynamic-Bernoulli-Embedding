 Three analogs phosphoenolpyruvic acid: (Z)-phosphoenol-3-fluoropyruvate, (Z)-phosphoenol-3-bromopyruvate (Z)-phosphoenol-alpha-ketobutyrate found substrates yeast pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate (Z)-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40)with maximal velocities much greater found rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. analogs exhibited sigmoidal kinetics, become hyperbolic upon addition allosteric effector, fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Moreover, reaction (Z)-phosphoenol-3-bromopyruvate ADP produce bromopyruvic acid ATP irreversibly inhibited enzyme half-life 32 min.
