 Accumulation conformationally altered cellular proteins (i.e., prion protein) common feature prions neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies demonstrated lack terminal sequence cellular prion protein (PrPC), necessary addition glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid anchor, leads protease-resistant conformation resembles scrapie-associated isoform prion protein. Moreover, mice overexpressing truncated form PrPC showed late-onset, amyloid deposition, presence short protease-resistant PrP fragment brain similar found Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease patients. Therefore, physiopathological function truncated_/anchorless 23-230 PrPC (Delta23-230 PrPC) come focus attention. present study aims revealing physiopathological function anchorless PrPC form identifying interacting proteins. truncated_/anchorless Delta23-230 PrPC along interacting proteins affinity purified using STrEP-Tactin chromatography, in-gel digested, identified quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry analysis prion protein-deficient murine hippocampus (HpL3-4) neuronal cell line. Twenty-three proteins appeared interact anchorless Delta23-230 PrPC HpL3-4 cells. 23 proteins, one novel protein, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM2), exhibited potential interaction anchorless Delta23-230 form PrPC. reverse co-immunoprecipitation confocal laser-scanning microscopic analysis confirmed interaction PKM2 anchorless Delta23-230 form PrPC. Furthermore, provide first evidence co-localization PKM2 PrPC well PrPC-dependent PKM2 expression regulation. addition, given involvement PrPC regulation apoptosis, exposed HpL3-4 cells staurosporine (STS)-mediated apoptotic stress. response STS-mediated apoptotic stress, HpL3-4 cells transiently expressing 23-230-truncated PrPC markedly less viable, prone apoptosis exhibited significantly higher PKM2 expressional regulation compared HpL3-4 cells transiently expressing full-length PrPC (1-253 PrPC). enhanced STS-induced apoptosis shown increased caspase-3 cleavage. Together, data suggest misbalance expression anchorless Delta23-230 form PrPC association expressional regulation interacting proteins could render cells prone cellular insults-stress response, formation aggregates may ultimately linked cell death.
