 Rapid adaptation ATP formation coronary flow required cardiac work altered. Cardiac energy status proposed control oxygen consumption (MVO2) release vasoactive adenosine (AR). investigate hypothesis linear relation free AMP AR, employed 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) newly elaborated guinea pig heart performing pressure-volume work. basal conditions, MVO2 7.8 +/- 1.0 mumol.min-1.g-1, free AMP 297 +/- 189 nM AR 226 +/- 179 pmol.min-1.g-1 (n = 29). Decreasing arterial PO2 50% reduced MVO2 increased free AMP 29%; however, AR rose threefold (n = 5). Doubling oxygen content perfusion medium (fluorocarbon emulsion) alter MVO2, free AMP, AR (n = 6). afterload doubled, MVO2 increased (+45%) AR decreased (-60%) despite change ADP AMP (n = 6). Dobutamine increased MVO2 (+50%) AMP (-98%); however, AR rose five times (n = 8). Switching substrates glucose + pyruvate glucose diminished MVO2 increased ADP twofold AMP fourfold, whereas AR remained constant (n = 6). findings demonstrate cardiac energy status also prime regulator oxidative phosphorylation isolated heart. Changes oxygen supply-to-demand ratio induced rise AR exceeded far increase free AMP. Thus, additional factors, possibly inhibition adenosine kinase, influence release vasoactive adenosine.
