 Plasma hormones, glucose free fatty acids, liver glycogen two key enzymes glycolysis gluconeogenesis examined adult rats 40-day period high protein feeding. Plasma insulin fell within 1 day returned normal 4 days. Glucagon changed slowly, reaching maximum day 4 declined near control value within 24 days. Consequently, insulin glucagon ratio lower days 1, 4 8 nearly normal day 24. respect hepatic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity rose sharply 1st day remained elevated 40-day period; L-isozyme pyruvate kinase, although unchanged 1st day, decreased thereafter day 8 represented 15--20% control. Circadian variations parameters also measured rats adapted high protein diet. animals, diurnal change plasma hormones less marked tended inverted respect controls; insulin/glucagon ratio highest daylight high protein late night control diet. 24 hours, pyruvate kinase activity related directly phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase inversely hormone ratio. concluded rats adapted high protein, controls, diurnal balance glycolysis gluconeogenesis probably regulated factor, namely insulin/glucagon ratio.
