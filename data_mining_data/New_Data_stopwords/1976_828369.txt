 complex problems microbiological degradation synthetic plastics fairly wide variety 62 testing materials, belonging 14 major groups plastics, described. Adaequate reliable testing techniques devised. Drawing experiences H. Braun, 1930, Bushnell Haas, 1941, metabolism bacteria utilization certain hydrocarbons microorganisms, previous research work A. Schwartz Berlin, 1959-60, microbial corrosion plastics, methods laboratory testing developed. bacteriological technique based selection aerobic microorganisms, were, starvation, adapted use plastic materials carbon source; foreign carbon sources strictly eliminated; emphasis laid proper, double control cultures. test organisms involved included P. aeruginosa fluorescens strains, also certain species Candida, mixtures soil, sewage garbage organisms grown exposed plastic surfaces. means series passages selective adaptation conservation organisms continued 4 1/2 years. anaerobic adaptation method Desulfovibrio desulfuricans developed used successfully. preliminary experimentation (Soil burial, sewage garbage exposure tests) laboratory well open, large scale Field testing programme realistic extent extreme conditions implemented: Nine different plastic materials comprising eight plain high polymer plastics comparison one synthetic Cellulose derivate, together glass control samples, exposed twelve different sewage, garbage, soil media period 3 months 2 years, subsequently examined. basis bacteriological results obtained adaptation series test materials classified three categories, corresponding stimulation bacterial growth: Group one, allowed strong proliferation, included certain types plasticized P.V.C. Cellulose esters, expected, and, new result, Polyurethane rubber; latter showed clear signs surface corrosion. Group two, induced clear moderate growth, comprised nylon trade type Polyamide. Gruop three, allowing weak still recognisable growth, included Formaldehyde pressure resing (Bakelite). surprising thought formaldehyde phenol components would exert bacteriocidic least bacteriostatic effect. results long time consuming adaptation series Pseudomonas aeruginosa confirmed manometric dissimilation method O.
