 present study undertaken determine whether bovine adipocytes could bind respond insulin. Adipose tissue young bulls showed little response physiological higher concentrations insulin 3-h incubation. contrast, insulin stimulate glucose uptake prolonged incubations also increased activity pyruvate kinase; case, half-maximum stimulation observed concentrations 0.5 ng/ml. Specific binding [125I] iodoinsulin bovine adipocytes observed; binding capacity greater young female rats determined conditions. Bovine adipocytes internalized insulin. Incubation bovine adipocytes insulin resulted concentration-dependent loss insulin receptors adipocyte surface. summary, bovine adipocytes possess capacity bind respond insulin; findings discussed relation recent report contrary.
