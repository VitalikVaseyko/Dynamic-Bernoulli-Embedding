 Epidemiological studies suggested repeated weight cycling time may increase risk coronary heart disease. mechanism involved remains poorly understood, change lipid metabolism weight cycling offered possible explanation. present study investigated effect weight cycling size fatty acid composition rat fat pads well serum cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, insulin, glucagon rats. Two consecutive weight cycles induced 40% energy restriction followed ad libitum refeeding either moderate-fat (MF; 22% energy) high-fat (HF; 45% energy) diet. lipogenic enzymes, including fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, malic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, lipoprotein lipase weight-cycled (WC) rats fed HF diet, yielded overshoot activities end two weight cycles. changes accompanied 80% increase size adipocyte 40-50% increase size perirenal epididymal fat tissues HF-WC rats. Regardless whether rats fed HF MF diet, WC rats showed gradual reduction linoleic alpha-linolenic acid increase palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic acid total body lipid. concluded weight cycling rats may promote body fatness HF diet consumed significantly alter whole body fatty acid balance irrespective whether consumed MF HF diet. importantly, weight cycling led overshoot fluctuation serum cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, insulin, glucagon. weight cycling associated increased risk cardiovascular disease, then, part mechanism may involve changes risk factors.
