 hypothesise intraerythrocytic malaria parasite metabolism merely fulfilling need ATP generation, evolved support rapid proliferation, similar seen rapidly proliferating cells cancer cells. Deregulated glycolytic activity coupled impaired mitochondrial metabolism metabolic strategy generate glycolytic intermediates essential rapid biomass generation schizogony. Further, discuss possibility Plasmodium metabolism functional consequence 'hard-wired' genome argue metabolism may also causal role triggering cascade events leads developmental stage transitions. hypothesis offers framework rationalise observations aerobic glycolysis, atypical mitochondrial metabolism, metabolic switching nonproliferating stages.
