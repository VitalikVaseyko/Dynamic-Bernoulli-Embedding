 cancer research, identifying specificity tumor cells compared 'normal' proliferating cells targeted therapy often considered Holy Grail researchers clinicians. Although diverse origin, cancer cells share characteristics including ability escape cell death mechanisms utilization different methods energy production. current paradigm, aerobic glycolysis considered central metabolic characteristic cancer cells (Warburg effect). However, recent data indicate cancer cells also show significant changes metabolic pathways. Indeed, recently suggested Kreb's cycle, pentose phosphate pathway intermediates, essential nonessential amino acids key roles. Renewed interest fact cancer cells reprogram metabolism order proliferate resist treatment must take consideration ability tumor cells adapt metabolism local microenvironment (low oxygen, low nutrients). variety metabolic sources might either strength, resulting infinite possibilities adaptation increased ability resist chemotherapy-induced death, weakness could targeted kill cancer cells. Here, discuss recent insights showing energetic metabolism may regulate cell death might relevant cancer treatment.
