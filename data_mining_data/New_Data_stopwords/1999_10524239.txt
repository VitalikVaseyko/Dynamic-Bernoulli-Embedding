 mitogen-regulated protein/proliferin (mrp/plf) genes encode closely related proteins stimulate cell proliferation angiogenesis. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) increases mrp/plf mRNA protein production 3T3 cells. Although three cloned mrp/plf gene promoters 97% identical, mrp3 transcriptionally activated bFGF. series truncated mrp3 promoter sequences tested determine minimal promoter sequence necessary bFGF-responsive transcription. Within minimal bFGF-responsive mrp3 promoter fragment, putative FGF-regulatory element (FRE) identified. Nuclear factors bind FRE present 3T3 cells. present upstream thymidine kinase basal promoter, FRE exhibits high transcriptional activity responds bFGF. Thus, FRE strong transcriptional element regulated bFGF may participate regulating mrp3 gene perhaps FGF-regulated genes.
