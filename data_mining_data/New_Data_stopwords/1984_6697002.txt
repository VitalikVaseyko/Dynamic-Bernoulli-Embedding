 new PK variant moderate hemolytic anemia described. enzymes nonanemic parents show sigmoidal reaction kinetics, normal kinetic parameters, differ respect nucleotide specificity, thermostability, concentrations glycolytic intermediates erythrocytes. characteristic features patient's (daughter) enzyme 30% activity, hyperbolic reaction kinetics two bands SDS-gel electrophoresis instead three bands observed parental enzymes. Moreover, pH-optimum shifted acidic range, affinity PEP ADP decreased, ATP inhibition negligible FDP-activation roughly ten times smaller controls. concentrations 2,3-DPG, 2-PG PEP erythrocyte increased, ATP decreased. consanguinity parents enzymes different PK mutant considered compound-heterozygous two different mutant PK alleles.
