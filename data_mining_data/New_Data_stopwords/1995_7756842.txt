 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, first component pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes two-step oxidative decarboxylation pyruvic acid. overexpress human E1 subunits individually, cDNAs mature forms human E1 alpha E1 beta subcloned either individually together plasmid pQE-9 expressed Escherichia coli M15. polyhistidine extension added NH2-termini recombinant E1 alpha E1 beta rapid purification proteins Ni-nitrilotriacetic-agarose chromatography. polyhistidine extension either E1 alpha E1 beta subunit affect activity recombinant tetrameric E1. Highly purified recombinant human E1 catalyzed partial reactions oxidative nonoxidative conversion pyruvic acid efficiency E1 purified bovine kidney. Recombinant human E1 interacted thiamin pyrophosphate forming charge transfer complex band 330 nm changed catalytic cycle. Recombinant human E1 phosphorylated E1-kinase (with concomitant inactivation) incorporating nearly three phosphoryl groups per mole E1. expressed individually, E1 alpha E1 beta subunits lacked catalytic activity oxidative nonoxidative reactions. Spectral studies demonstrated thiamin pyrophosphate binding either recombinant E1 alpha E1 beta subunit. E1 alpha subunit retained ability phosphorylated; however, incorporation phosphoryl groups recombinant E1 alpha alone 12% observed tetrameric E1. findings show subunits required formation active center catalysis.
