 OBJECTIVE: determine molecular alterations maintain energy homeostasis hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell cancer (HLRCC) uterine tumors disrupted fumarate hydratase, compared nonsyndromic uterine tumors. DESIGN: Laboratory study. SETTING: Tertiary academic university hospital. PATIENT(S): Eleven nonsyndromic leiomyoma-myometrium pairs three HLRCC leiomyoma-myometrium pairs obtained patients recruited national military research centers United States. INTERVENTION(S): Molecular analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell cancer nonsyndromic leiomyomas compared patient-matched myometrium relative glycolysis Krebs cycle gene expression. RESULT(S): microarray analysis, confirmed fumarate hydratase messenger RNA (mRNA) underexpressed HLRCC fibroids, compared matched myometrium. Consistent possibility alterations fumarate hydratase represented change anaerobic state, found HLRCC fibroids overexpressed genes phosphofructokinase, aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase. Expression genes altered nonsyndromic leiomyomas. Furthermore, overt changes expression Krebs cycle enzyme gene expression, exception fumarate hydratase. CONCLUSION(S): findings demonstrate alterations fumarate hydratase compensated increases glycolysis enzyme expression HLRCC.
