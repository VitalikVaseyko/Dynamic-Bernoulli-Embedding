 enzymatic method proposed measuring acetylpolyamine (AcPA) alone, even non-acetylated polyamine co-exists. method consisted four enzymatic reactions. First, AcPA hydrolysed acylpolyamine amidohydrolase yield acetate; followed three reactions coupled three enzymes, respectively, acetate kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; acetate formation caused decrease NADH. quantity AcPA evaluated change absorbance 340 nm. reagent composition reaction mixture determined, characteristics method investigated. validation tests produced satisfactory results. co-existence non-acetylated polyamine gave effect measurement. present method found used easily, rapidly reliably selective determination AcPA itself.
