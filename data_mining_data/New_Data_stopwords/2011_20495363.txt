 others previously identified loss stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) powerful single independent predictor breast cancer patient tumor recurrence, metastasis, tamoxifen-resistance, poor clinical outcome. However, remains unknown loss stromal Cav-1 mediates effects clinically. mechanistically address issue, generated novel human tumor xenograft model. two-component system, nude mice co-injected i) human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), ii) stromal fibroblasts (wild-type (WT) versus Cav-1 (-/-) deficient). allowed us directly evaluate effects Cav-1 deficiency solely tumor stromal compartment. Here, show Cav-1-deficient stromal fibroblasts sufficient promote tumor growth angiogenesis, recruit Cav-1 (+) micro-vascular cells. Proteomic analysis Cav-1-deficient stromal fibroblasts indicates cells upregulate expression glycolytic enzymes, hallmark aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect). Thus, Cav-1-deficient stromal fibroblasts may contribute towards tumor growth angiogenesis, providing energy-rich metabolites paracrine fashion. previously termed new idea "Reverse Warburg Effect". direct support notion, treatment xenograft model glycolysis inhibitors functionally blocks positive effects Cav-1-deficient stromal fibroblasts breast cancer tumor growth. Thus, pharmacologically-induced metabolic restriction (via treatment glycolysis inhibitors) may promising new therapeutic strategy breast cancer patients lack stromal Cav-1 expression. also identify stromal expression PKM2 LDH-B new candidate biomarkers "Reverse Warburg Effect" "Stromal-Epithelial Metabolic Coupling" human breast cancers.
