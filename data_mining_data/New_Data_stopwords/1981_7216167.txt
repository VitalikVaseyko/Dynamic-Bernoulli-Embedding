 Relationships subcellular adenine nucleotides (ATP, ASP), heart function oxidative myocardial metabolism studied isolated working guinea pig heart. heart preparations stimulated noradrenaline utilized pyruvate alone combination glucose energy-providing substrates. Using density gradient centrifugation lyophilized myocardial homogenates non-aqueous media following subcellular distribution ATP ADP, respectively, obtained: concentration ATP cytosol higher mitochondria content ADP different. overall ATP/ADP ratio cytosol 10-fold lower concentration ratio free ATP ADP cytosol derived cytosolic creatine kinase equilibrium. Furthermore, mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio much lower free cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio. concentration term phosphorylation potential ATP (RT [ADP] x [Pi]/[ATP]) thus higher cytosol mitochondria. Myocardial function substrate oxidation exhibited typical augmentations infusion 0.08 microM noradrenaline. However, increased heart performance oxidative myocardial metabolism associated major changes cytosolic ATP ADP contents. hand, free ATP/ADP ratio particularly phosphorylation state ATP, i.e. ration [ATP]/[ADP] x [Pi], decreased cytosol. contrast, mitochondria adenine-nucleotide concentration ratios substantially changed conditions. results compatible asymmetrical translocation adenine nucleotides across mitochondrial membrane working hearts. reciprocal relationship rates oxidative metabolism free cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio indicates mitochondrial respiration intact heart could controlled phosphorylation state extramitochondrial ATP.
