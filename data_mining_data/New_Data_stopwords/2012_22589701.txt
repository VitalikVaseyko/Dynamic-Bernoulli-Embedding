 Elevated aerobic glycolysis cancer cells (the Warburg effect) may attributed respiration injury mitochondrial dysfunction, underlying mechanisms therapeutic significance remain elusive. report induction mitochondrial respiratory defect tetracycline-controlled expression dominant negative form DNA polymerase gamma causes metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis increases ROS generation. show upregulation NOX critical support elevated glycolysis providing additional NAD+. upregulation NOX also consistently observed cancer cells compromised mitochondria due activation oncogenic Ras loss p53, primary pancreatic cancer tissues. Suppression NOX chemical inhibition genetic knockdown gene expression selectively impacts cancer cells mitochondrial dysfunction, leading decrease cellular glycolysis, loss cell viability, inhibition cancer growth vivo. study reveals previously unrecognized function NOX cancer metabolism suggests NOX potential novel target cancer treatment.
