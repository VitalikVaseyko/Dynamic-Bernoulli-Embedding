 1. Flight insects characterized intense respiration known biology also controlled. Thus insect flight muscle may tissue choice study biochemical adaptation control catabolism biological oxidations, many results obtained insects significance relevance transcend boundaries classes. insects, blowfly, flight distinguished additionally high wingbeat frequencies asynchronous type excitation-contraction coupling. spite intense muscular work, metabolic processes limited availability oxygen. Also importance morphological organization flight muscle mitochondria, evolved ultrastructurally biochemically effective catabolic machine. 2. fly, carbohydrate, principally glycogen, sole metabolic fuel; fats used flight enzymes concerned fatty acid utilization virtually lacking. Glycogenolysis lead lactic acid; instead, end products glycolysis pyruvate alpha-glycerophosphate. alpha-glycerophosphate cycle provides mechanism reoxidation glycolytically produced NADH also stoicheiometric formation molecule hexose equivalent two molecules pyruvate, available oxidation via tricarboxylate cycle. absence dicarboxylate tricarboxylate carriers mitochondria ensures tricarboxylate-cycle intermediates exit mitochondrion pyruvate oxidized completion. initiation flight, mitochondrial oxidation pyruvate impeded lack tricarboxylate-cycle intermediates generation oxaloacetate. circumvented oxidation proline. 3. controls metabolism flight muscle, i.e. (1) glycogenolysis phosphorylase phosphorylase kinase, (2) glycolysis phosphofructokinase, (3) alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, (4) proline dehydrogenase (5) tricarboxylate cycle isocitrate dehydrogenase, effected phosphate potential and/or Ca2+. suggested metabolic changes, seen rest-to-flight transition, achieved concerted actions effectors different loci.
