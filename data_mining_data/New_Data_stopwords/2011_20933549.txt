 GUT1 gene halotolerant yeast Pichia farinosa, encoding glycerokinase (EC 2.7.1.30), expressed Pichia pastoris. purification factor approximately 61-fold achieved combination nickel affinity anion exchange chromatography. specific activity final preparation 201.6 units per mg protein yield 21%. nearly homogeneous enzyme preparation confirmed SDS-polyacrylamide gels mass spectrometry analysis. Glycerol stabilized purified enzyme long-term storage -80 degrees C. pH temperature optima range 6.5-7.0 45-50 degrees C, respectively. ATP effective phosphoryl group donor tested. Additionally, enzyme phosphorylated glycerol also ITP, UTP, GTP CTP. K(m) values enzyme ATP ITP 0.428 0.845 mM, respectively. kinetic properties enzyme respect UTP, GTP, CTP suggested glycerokinase exhibited negative cooperativity double reciprocal plots showed biphasic response increasing nucleoside triphosphate concentrations. application coupling enzyme determination pyruvate kinase activity cell extracts Madin-Darby canine kidney cells showed good reproducibility compared commercially available preparation bacterial glycerokinase.
