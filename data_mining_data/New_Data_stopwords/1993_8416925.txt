 Similar cold-sensitive properties, values dissociation constants (Kd = 1 x 10(-10) M), regulatory effectors found cold-sensitive cytosolic 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3)-binding protein (CTBP) pyruvate kinase human erythrocyte. Various metabolites blood cell assayed effects CTBP activity heat cold preincubation treatments. Among compounds, five- six-carbon phosphorylated sugars effective protecting CTBP activity cold inactivation, whereas ATP dATP blocked activation heat treatments. effects fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, ATP obtained physiological concentrations. Three-carbon phosphorylated intermediates glycolysis, ADP, AMP, cAMP, GTP effect cold heat treatments. monomer-tetramer interconversion enzyme also regulated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate ATP. association control fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, whereas dissociation ATP control. regulation may physiological relevance since hormone binds tetrameric form enzyme site active site.
