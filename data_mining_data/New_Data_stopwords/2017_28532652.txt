 Upregulation glycolysis often observed human HER2-overexpressing cancers. study, demonstrated KU004, dual novel EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, disrupted cancer cell proliferation via modulation glycolysis. KU004, inhibited Warburg effect suppressing hexokinase II (HK2) expression transcriptional post-translational levels. study demonstrated downregulation HKII KU004 mainly mediated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, role HKII downregulation KU004-mediated antitumor effect also confirmed vivo xenograft model. Collectively, data suggest multifaceted targeting aberrant glucose metabolism along upstream HER2 may effective approach clinical treatment HER2+ cancer.
