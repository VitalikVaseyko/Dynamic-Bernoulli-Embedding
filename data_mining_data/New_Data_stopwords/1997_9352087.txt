 previous study described unusual influence neutral salts behavior trout muscle AMP-deaminase (AMPD) interactions subcellular particulate matter (Lushchak Storey 1994, Fish Physiol. Biochem. 13: 356-368). present study shows behavior also shared muscle enzyme two fish species, sea scorpion (Scorpaena porcus) corb (Sciena umbra), indicating describes principle AMPD interaction cellular particulate material. AMPD binding particulate matter increased increasing KCl concentration physiological range (100-200 mM), higher salt concentrations amount bound enzyme reduced. pattern binding influenced hydrophobic interactions since addition nonionic detergents, Triton X-100 Tween-80, alter distribution bound versus free enzyme although detergents, low concentrations, enhanced enzyme maximal activity. AMPD binding particulate matter also influenced pH, amount free enzyme rising nearly 3-fold pH fell within physiological range 7.5 6.5. concluded neither electrostatic hydrophobic forces alone account unusual solubilization AMPD fish muscle possible effect also related ion-induced conformational changes structure AMPD and/or myosin enzyme binds.
