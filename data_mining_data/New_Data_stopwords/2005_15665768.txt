 BACKGROUND: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) occurs settings transplantation, trauma, elective liver resections. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) shown play major role organ I/R injury. Pyruvate, key intermediate cellular metabolism, effective scavenger ROS. purpose study test hypothesis ethyl pyruvate (EP), soluble pyruvate derivative, effective preventing hepatic I/R injury. METHODS: Lewis rats underwent 60 minutes partial warm hepatic ischemia. Three doses EP dissolved lactated Ringer's solution lactated Ringer's solution (LR) alone given intravenous injection. Serum tissue samples obtained 1 24 hours postreperfusion. RESULTS: Serum transaminases, degree hepatic necrosis, neutrophil infiltration significantly decreased EP-treated rats compared control animals. amount hepatic lipid peroxidation also significantly decreased EP-treated animals. circulating levels hepatic expression inflammatory cytokines significantly decreased EP-treated animals. Furthermore, EP inhibited activation extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases, well nuclear factor-kappaB, signaling pathways involved cytokine release. Treatment EP also inhibited hepatic apoptosis. CONCLUSION: EP protective effect hepatic I/R injury, mediated part decreasing lipid peroxidation, down-regulation inflammatory mediators, inhibition apoptosis. Strategies using additive LR solution considered clinical settings ischemic liver injury decrease organ damage.
