 BACKGROUND: Efficacy withaferin (WA), Ayurvedic medicine constituent, prevention mammary cancer associated mechanisms investigated using mouse mammary tumor virus-neu (MMTV-neu) transgenic model. METHODS: Incidence burden mammary cancer pulmonary metastasis scored female MMTV-neu mice 28 weeks intraperitoneal administration 100 microg WA (three times/week) (n = 32) vehicle (n = 29). Mechanisms underlying mammary cancer prevention WA investigated determination tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolomics, proteomics using plasma and/or tumor tissues. Spectrophotometric assays performed determine activities complex III complex IV. statistical tests two-sided. RESULTS: WA administration resulted statistically significant decrease macroscopic mammary tumor size, microscopic mammary tumor area, incidence pulmonary metastasis. example, mean area invasive cancer lower 95.14% WA treatment group compared control group (mean = 3.10 vs 63.77 mm2, respectively; difference = -60.67 mm2; 95% confidence interval = -122.50 1.13 mm2; P = .0536). Mammary cancer prevention WA treatment associated increased apoptosis, inhibition complex III activity, reduced levels glycolysis intermediates. Proteomics confirmed downregulation many glycolysis-related proteins tumor WA-treated mice compared control, including M2-type pyruvate kinase, phospho glycerate kinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase isoform 2. CONCLUSIONS: study reveals suppression glycolysis WA-mediated mammary cancer prevention clinically relevant mouse model.
