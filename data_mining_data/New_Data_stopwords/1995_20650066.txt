 Cultured rat hepatocytes often used vitro studies. culture system lack normal environment cells would exposed vivo contributes change differentiation. study differentiation problem compared effects culturing primary hepatocytes extracellular matrix (ECM) isolated normal rat livers 3T3 (mouse fibroblast) feeder layer. use two coatings result changes survival time, measured leakage lactate dehydrogenase, differentiation (activities pyruvate kinase gamma-glutamyltransferase) specific functions (albumin production concentration cytochrome P-450) comparison cells cultured plastic. Since positive effects coatings found proposed attention paid methods isolating culturing hepatocytes, rather obtaining conditions hepatocytes completely comparable vivo situation.
