 BACKGROUNDS: Numerous studies reported aberrant pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) expressed cancer, indicating PKM2 plays critical role tumor initiation progression. Nevertheless, prognostic value breast cancer tumor yet contentious. Therefore, performed meta-analysis evaluate prognostic significance PKM2 breast cancer. METHODS: Eligible relevant literatures retrieved searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase December 2016. Articles comparing different PKM2 expression levels human breast cancer tissues prognostic significance included. Software RevMan 5.3 STATA (Review Manager (RevMan): [Computer program]. Version 5.3. Copenhagen: Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, 2014. STATA: StataCorp. 2011. Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) applied analyze outcomes. Pooled results presented hazardous ratios (HRs) 5-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), odds ratios (ORs) clinicopathological features 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Data 6 involved studies 895 patients summarized. Breast cancer patients high PKM2 worse OS (pooled HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.31-2.08, P < .001) PFS (pooled HR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.84-3.36, P < .00001). High PKM2 expression related lymph node metastasis (N1+N2+N3 vs N0, = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.39-2.80, P = .0001). outcome stability verified via sensitivity analysis. elevated PKM2 expression correlated tumor stage (T2+T3 vs T1, pooled = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.36-1.77, P = .58) differential grade (G2+G3 vs G1, = 2.74, 95%CI = 0.76-9.84, P = .12). publication bias found included studies OS (Begg test, P = .260; Egger test, P = .747). CONCLUSIONS: High PKM2 expression denotes worse OS PFS breast cancer patients, correlate lymph node metastasis. However, evidence impact PKM2 expression stage tumor differentiation.
