 OBJECTIVE: construct recombinant vector Giardia canis virus (GCV)-specific hammerhead ribozyme pyruvate kinase (PK) Giardia lamblia. METHODS: Using RNA draw software, secondary structure PK gene Giardia predicted cleavage site ribozyme selected. antisense-specific hammerhead ribozyme (PKH) targeting site designed. DNA encoding ribozyme synthesized recombinant vector pGCV-PKH constructed. extracellular intracellular cleavage PK mRNA carried linear recombinant vector. Trophozoites group observed fluorescent microscopy 24th hour transfection. Real-time PCR used relative quantitative analysis cleavage products. RESULTS: recombinant vector GCV-specific hammerhead ribozyme pyruvate kinase Giardia lamblia (pGCV-PKH) constructed. Intracellular cleavage assays showed green fluorescence could seen pGCV-GFP transfected trophozoites. relative content PK mRNA pGCV-PKH transfected group 33.14% normal control group. could cleave PK mRNA extracellularly efficiency 58.5%. CONCLUSION: recombinant vector transfect Giardia trophozoites, cleave mRNA PK intracellularly extracellularly.
