 mitochondrial kinases responsible phosphorylation inactivation rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex rat liver heart branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes purified homogeneity. branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase composed one subunit molecular weight 44 kDa; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase two subunits molecular weights 48 (alpha) 45 kDa (beta). Proteolysis maps branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase two subunits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase different, suggesting subunits different entities. alpha subunit rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase selectively cleaved chymotrypsin concomitant loss kinase activity, previously shown bovine kidney enzyme, suggesting catalytic activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase resides subunit. Polyclonal antibodies branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, purified epitope selection method, bound 44 kDa polypeptide branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, substantiating 44 kDa protein corresponds kinase complex. kinases exhibited strong substrate specificity toward respective complexes would inactivate heterologous complexes. kinases possessed slightly different substrate specificities toward histones. Phosphorylation inactivation branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex purified kinase inhibited alpha-chloroisocaproate dichloroacetate, established inhibitors phosphorylation complex. cDNAs encoding branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase isolated rat heart rat liver lambda gt11 libraries. represents first successful cloning mitochondrial protein kinase. Preliminary data suggest two different isoforms kinase may exist different ratios various tissues. evidence found induction branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex kinase clofibric acid. Rather, clofibric acid potent inhibitor activity branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase may molecular mechanism responsible myotonic effects clofibric acid man.
