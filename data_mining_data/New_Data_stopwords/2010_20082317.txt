 order understand molecular mechanisms multidrug resistance (MDR) ovarian cancer, employed proteomic approach isobaric tags relative absolute quantification (iTRAQ), followed LC-MS/MS, using cisplatin-resistant COC1/DDP cell line parental COC1 cell line model. total number 28 proteins differentially expressed identified, differential expression levels partially identified proteins confirmed Western blot analysis and/or real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, association PKM2 HSPD1, two differentially expressed proteins, MDR analyzed, results showed could contribute considerably cisplatin resistance ovarian cancer cell. differential expression proteins could classified eight categories based functions, is, calcium binding proteins, chaperones, extracellular matrix, proteins involved drug detoxification repair DNA damage, metabolic enzymes, transcription factor, proteins related cellular structure proteins relative signal transduction. data valuable study mechanisms MDR ovarian cancer.
