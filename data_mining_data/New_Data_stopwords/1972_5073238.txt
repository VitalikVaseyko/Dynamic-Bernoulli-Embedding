 1. Tetrodotoxin, concentrations abolishes generation action potentials nervous system, enhances 300% rate anaerobic glycolysis brain-cortex slices adult rats, adult infant guinea pigs. occurs greater extent Ca(2+)-deficient incubation media Ca(2+)-rich media. Tetrodotoxin accelerative effect cerebral aerobic glycolysis. 2. Tetrodotoxin affect rate anaerobic glycolysis 2-day-old rat brain-cortex slices, adult rat kidney medulla, extract acetone-dried powder brain. 3. Tetrodotoxin affect rate penetration glucose brain slices. 4. effect apparent added 10min later onset anoxia. 5. effect diminishes concentration K(+) incubation medium increased Na(+) decreased. 6. salient effect, onset anoxia, diminish influx Na(+) into, efflux K(+) from, brain slices. 7. Substances promote cerebral influx Na(+), e.g. protoveratrine, sodium l-glutamate, diminish accelerative action tetrodotoxin. 8. concluded tetrodotoxin exerts effect anaerobic glycolysis suppressing, onset anoxia, generation action potentials thereby accompanying influx Na(+) efflux K(+). suggested glycolytic stimulation occurs rate-limiting step, e.g. operation pyruvate kinase, stimulated K(+) depressed Na(+). 9. Local anaesthetics behave manner similar tetrodotoxin enhancing cerebral anaerobic glycolysis. 10. Sodium Amytal marked effect relatively high concentration. 11. Tetrodotoxin diminishes efflux amino acids, particularly glutamate aspartate, onset anoxia.
