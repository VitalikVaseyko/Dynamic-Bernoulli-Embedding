 investigated effect dexamethasone last week pregnancy glucose lipid metabolism male offspring. Twelve-week old offspring evaluated fasting 12-hours (physiological) 60-hours (prolonged). Physiological fasting resulted glucose intolerance, decreased glucose clearance pyruvate load increased PEPCK expression rats born dexamethasone-treated mothers (DEX). Prolonged fasting resulted increased glucose tolerance increased glucose clearance pyruvate load DEX. modulations accompanied accumulation hepatic triglycerides (TG). Sixty-hour fasted DEX also showed increased citrate synthase (CS) activity, ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) content, pyruvate kinase 2 (pkm2), glucose transporter 1 (slc2a1) lactate dehydrogenase-a (ldha) expressions. Hepatic AKT2 increased 60-hour fasted DEX, parallel reduced miRNAs targeting AKT2 gene. Altogether, show metabolic programming prenatal dexamethasone characterized unexpected hepatic TG accumulation prolonged fasting. underlying mechanism may depend increased hepatic glycolytic flux due increased pkm2 expression consequent conversion pyruvate non-esterified fatty acid synthesis due increased CS activity ACLY levels. Upregulation AKT2 due reduced miRNAs may serve permanent mechanism leading increased pkm2 expression.
