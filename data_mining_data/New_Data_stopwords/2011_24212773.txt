 Due inherently hypoxic environment, cancer cells often resort glycolysis, anaerobic breakdown glucose form ATP provide energy needs, known Warburg effect. time, overexpression insulin receptor non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) associated increased risk metastasis decreased survival. uptake glucose cells carried via glucose transporters GLUTs. these, GLUT-4 essential insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Following treatment epigenetic targeting agents histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), GLUT-3 GLUT-4 expression found induced NSCLC cell lines, minimal responses transformed normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Similar results GLUT-4 observed cells derived liver, muscle, kidney pre-adipocytes. Bioinformatic analysis promoter GLUT-4 indicates may also regulated several chromatin binding factors complexes including CTCF, SP1 SMYD3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate promoter GLUT-4 dynamically remodeled response HDACi. Overall, results may value within clinical setting (a) may possible use enhance fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging sensitivity; (b) may possible target NSCLC use HDACi insulin mediated uptake metabolic targeting drugs 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG); (c) enhance sensitize NSCLC chemotherapy.
