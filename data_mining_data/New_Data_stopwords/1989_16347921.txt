 progressive decline glycolytic activity Saccharomyces cerevisiae batch fermentation accompanied changes adenine nucleotide pools. relative activities four glycolytic enzymes examined vitro presence nucleotide concentrations equivalent intracellular pools. Phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase inhibited. Phosphoglycerate kinase inhibited AMP judged unlikely physiological consequence owing enzyme abundance. isoenzymes hexokinase strongly inhibited AMP. degree hexokinase inhibition sufficient account observed decline glycolytic activity batch fermentation.
