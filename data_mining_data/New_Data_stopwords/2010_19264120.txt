 accumulating evidence oxidative stress plays important role aging. previous phosphoproteomic study human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y revealed changes phosphorylation several proteins lamin A/C 6-hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative stress. present study employed native proteomic analysis clarify protein-protein interaction physiological conditions. examined oxidative stress-related changes SH-SY5Y cellular proteins using blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), powerful tool separation protein complexes. BN-PAGE gel images showed successful separation several complexes. Components complexes, separated 2-D BN-PAGE combination SDS-PAGE, identified peptide mass fingerprinting employing MALDI-TOF MS MS/MS ion search LC-MS/MS. TCP-1 complex, ATP synthase, complex heat shock protein 90 client proteins pyruvate kinase detected. Two dimensional BN-PAGE Western blot analysis revealed increase lamin A/C associated heat shock protein 90 response 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress.
