 USP20, one deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) belonging subfamily ubiquitin-specific protease (USP), regulates ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. far, USP20 identified binding protein regulator hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, beta-adrenergic receptor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). order investigate biological functions USP20 novel substrates, searched putative substrates two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis. found several putative substrates, related cancer metabolism neural disorders. Among these, pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) high identity score. cancer cells contain specific metabolic pathway, referred Warburg effect. One well-known function PKM2 main regulator cancer metabolic pathways, PKM2 promotes Warburg effect tumor growth. addition, PKM2 HIF-1alpha upregulate expression target genes. evidence, expected USP20 would associated metabolic pathway regulation PKM2 ubiquitination. Despite various roles DUBs, biological functions USP20 cellular mechanisms poorly understood. Herein, investigated inter-action PKM2 USP20. results suggest new molecular pathway cancer metabolism regulation PKM2.
