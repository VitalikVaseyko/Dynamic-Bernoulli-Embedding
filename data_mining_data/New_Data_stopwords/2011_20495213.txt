 Mitochondrial functions dynamically regulated heart. particular, protein phosphorylation shown key mechanism modulating mitochondrial function diverse cardiovascular phenotypes. However, site-specific phosphorylation information remains scarce organ. Accordingly, performed comprehensive characterization murine cardiac mitochondrial phosphoproteome context mitochondrial functional pathways. platform using complementary fragmentation technologies collision-induced dissociation (CID) electron transfer dissociation (ETD) demonstrated successful identification total 236 phosphorylation sites murine heart; 210 sites novel. 236 sites mapped 181 phosphoproteins 203 phosphopeptides. Among identified, 45 phosphorylation sites captured CID, whereas 185 phosphorylation sites, including novel modification ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase protein 1 (Ser-212), identified ETD, underscoring advantage combined CID ETD approach. biological significance cardiac mitochondrial phosphoproteome evaluated. investigations illustrated key regulatory sites murine cardiac mitochondrial pathways targets phosphorylation regulation, including components electron transport chain (ETC) complexes enzymes involved metabolic pathways (e.g. tricarboxylic acid cycle). Furthermore, calcium overload injured cardiac mitochondrial ETC function, whereas enhanced phosphorylation ETC via application phosphatase inhibitors restored calcium-attenuated ETC complex complex III activities, demonstrating positive regulation ETC function phosphorylation. Moreover, silico analyses identified phosphopeptide motifs illuminated molecular nature participating kinases, included several known mitochondrial kinases (e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) well kinases whose mitochondrial location previously appreciated (e.g. Src). conclusion, phosphorylation events defined herein advance understanding cardiac mitochondrial biology, facilitating integration still fragmentary knowledge mitochondrial signaling networks, metabolic pathways, intrinsic mechanisms functional regulation heart.
