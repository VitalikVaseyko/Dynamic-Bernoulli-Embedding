 Oxygen may enhance CO2-saturated photosynthesis intact leaves, display Warburg effect illuminated current atmospheric level CO2 O2, 350 microl l(-1) 21%, respectively. magnitude stimulation depends irradiance. K(M)(O2) stimulation 128 microM (10.6% O2). Maximum enhancement wheat leaves 6.1 5.3 micromol m(-2) s(-1 )under 27.9 18.7 mW cm(-2), respectively, corresponding 25-30% increase ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) turnover rate compared O2-free ambient gas phase. stimulation appears 5-10 sharp increase O2. response decrease O2, new stabilized rate reached 5-7 min. stimulation involve increase activity Rubisco. effect correlates increased concentration RuBP. Oxygen enhances CO2-saturated photosynthesis acting terminal electron acceptor photosynthetic electron transport. magnitude effect may adopted index pseudocyclic photophosphorylation vivo.
