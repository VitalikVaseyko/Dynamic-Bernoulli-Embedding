 One outcome activation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway increased aerobic glycolysis, upstream signaling events regulate PI3K pathway, thus Warburg effect, elusive. Increasing evidence suggests Plk1, cell cycle regulator, also involved cellular events addition mitosis. test whether Plk1 contributes activation PI3K pathway, thus aerobic glycolysis, examined potential targets Plk1 identified PTEN Plk1 substrate. hypothesize Plk1 phosphorylation PTEN leads inactivation, activation PI3K pathway, Warburg effect. data show overexpression Plk1 leads activation PI3K pathway enhanced aerobic glycolysis. contrast, inhibition Plk1 causes markedly reduced glucose metabolism mice. Mechanistically, show Plk1 phosphorylation PTEN Nedd4-1, E3 ubiquitin ligase PTEN, results PTEN inactivation. Finally, show Plk1 phosphorylation PTEN promotes tumorigenesis phosphatase-dependent -independent pathways, revealing potentially new drug targets arrest tumor cell growth.
