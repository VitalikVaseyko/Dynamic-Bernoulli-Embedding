 Eukarya pyruvate kinases glutamate position 117 (numbered according rabbit muscle enzyme), whereas Bacteria either glutamate lysine Archaea residues. Glutamate position makes pyruvate kinases K+-dependent, whereas lysine confers K+-independence positively charged residue substitutes monovalent cation charge. Interestingly, pyruvate kinases two characterized Crenarchaeota exhibit K+-independent activity, despite serine equivalent position. better understand pyruvate kinase catalytic activity absence K+ internal positive charge, Thermofilum pendens pyruvate kinase (valine equivalent position) characterized. enzyme activity K+-independent. kinetic mechanism random order rapid equilibrium, equal mechanism rabbit muscle enzyme presence K+ mutant E117K absence K+. Thus, substrate binding order T. pendens enzyme independent despite lacking internal positive charge. Thermal stability studies enzyme showed two calorimetric transitions, one attributable C domains (Tm 99.2 degrees C), (Tm 105.2 degrees C) associated B domain. contrast, rabbit muscle enzyme exhibits single calorimetric transition (Tm 65.2 degrees C). calorimetric kinetic data indicate B domain hyperthermophilic enzyme stable rest protein conformation induces catalytic readiness enzyme. B domain interactions pyruvate kinases determined Pyrobaculum aerophilum modeled T. pendens compared rabbit muscle enzyme. results show intra- interdomain interactions Crenarchaeota enzymes may account higher B domain stability. Thus structural arrangement T. pendens pyruvate kinase could allow charge-independent catalysis.
