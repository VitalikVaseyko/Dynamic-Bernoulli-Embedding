 Separation erythrocytes fractions different age carried method discontinuous gradient. Five fraction various specific density prepared fraction age dependent enzyme activities PK G-6-PD assayed. erythrocytes cord blood newborn 4-5 days old studied. results demonstrate correlation density erythrocyte age cord blood blood newborns. However, 4-5 days old demonstrate shift various populations toward fractions higher density.
