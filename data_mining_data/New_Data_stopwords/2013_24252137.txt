 BACKGROUND: deregulated energy metabolism hallmark malignant disease offers possible future targets treatment. investigated prognostic value glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2), mitochondrial beta-F1-ATPase (ATP5B) bioenergetic cellular (BEC) index advanced ovarian cancer. METHODS: Fresh tumor samples prospectively collected 123 patients undergoing primary surgery suspected advanced ovarian cancer. these, 57 met eligibility criteria; stage IIC-IV, serous endometrioid subtype, specimens containing >/= 50% tumor cells patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. adequate amount mRNA could extracted one case, resultant study population 56 patients. Eighty-six percent cases serous tumors, 93% grade 2-3. GAPDH, PKM2 ATP5B mRNA- protein expression assessed real-time PCR immunohistochemistry. estimated association platinum-free interval (PFI) overall survival (OS) Cox proportional hazards models. Median follow-up 60 months. RESULTS: High GAPDH mRNA levels (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.0-4.5) low BEC-index (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.95) independently associated shorter PFI. Median PFI patients high GAPDH mRNA 5.0 months compared 10.1 months low expression cases (p = 0.031). Similarly, median PFI patients low BEC-index based mRNA 5.3 months compared 9.8 months high BEC-index cases (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: High GAPDH low BEC-index mRNA expression indicate early disease progression advanced serous ovarian cancer.
