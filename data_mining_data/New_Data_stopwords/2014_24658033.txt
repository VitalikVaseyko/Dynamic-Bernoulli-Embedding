 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) predominantly expressed cancers, considered key regulator Warburg effect. study, HSP40 identified novel binding partner PKM2. HSP40-PKM2 association destabilized PKM2 protein HSC70. presence HSP40, PKM2 protein level PKM2-mediated PDK1 expression down-regulated. Moreover, HSP40 involved regulating glucose metabolism PKM2 dependent way mean time effect mitochondrial oxygen respiration. line inhibition effect HSP40 glycolysis, growth cancer cells inhibited HSP40.Our data provided new regulation mechanism PKM2, suggested new therapeutic target cancer therapy.
