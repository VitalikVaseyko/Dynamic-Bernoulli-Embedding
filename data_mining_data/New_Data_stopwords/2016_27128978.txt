 human Glucose Transporter 1 (hGLUT1 SLC2A1) facilitative membrane transporter found liver, intestines, kidney, brain, transports sugars d-glucose d-galactose. Genetic variations hGLUT1 associated broad range diseases metabolic disorders. example, hGLUT1 upregulated various cancer types (e.g., breast carcinoma) support increased anaerobic glycolysis Warburg effect. Thus, hGLUT1 emerging therapeutic target, also transports commonly used cancer biomarkers (e.g., (18)F-DG). study, use computational prediction followed experimental testing, characterize hGLUT1. construct homology models hGLUT1 partially occluded outward open ("occluded") conformation based X-ray structure E. coli xylose transporter, XylE. Comparison binding site occluded models experimentally determined hGLUT structures revealed hydrophobic pocket adjacent sugar-binding site, tested experimentally via site-directed mutagenesis. Virtual screening various libraries purchasable compounds occluded models, followed experimental testing cellular assays revealed seven previously unknown hGLUT1 ligands IC50 values ranging 0.45 muM 59 muM. ligands represent three unique chemotypes chemically different known hGLUT1 ligands. newly characterized hydrophobic pocket potentially utilized new ligands increased affinity. Furthermore, previously unknown hGLUT1 ligands serve chemical tools characterize hGLUT1 function lead molecules future drug development.
