 Enzymes various glycolysis stages, i.e. hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, detected cyclosporine-producing organisms belonging Tolypocladium. initial activity enzymes highly active strain much higher starting low active strain. fermentation activity glycolysis enzymes per 1 mg mycelium protein strains increased. accompanied decrease respiration activity. Therefore, direct correlation cyclosporine biosynthesis glycolytic activity mycelium Tolypocladium sp.
