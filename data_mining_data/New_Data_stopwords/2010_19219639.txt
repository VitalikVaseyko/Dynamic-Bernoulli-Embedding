 regulation seed oil synthesis rapeseed largely unknown. study, Arabidopsis microarray used analyze gene differential expression immature seeds 30 days flowering high oil Brassica napus, H105, whose oil content 46.04 +/- 1.42, 53.94 +/- 1.35 53.09 +/- 1.35% planted Nanjing (altitude: 8.9 m), Xining (altitude: 2261.2 m) Lhasa (altitude: 3658 m), respectively. Transcript levels 363 genes 421 genes altered twofold H105 planted Xining Lhasa compared Nanjing, respectively. Together, 53 common up-regulated 42 common down-regulated expression transcripts shared H105 planted Xining Lhasa compared Nanjing. important genes, sucrose synthase, pyruvate kinase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase related sugar metabolism identified common up-regulated higher oil content H105. results revealed expressional disciplinarian correlative genes, provided important information molecular genetic mechanism oil content difference rapeseed. addition, differential expression genes could suitable targets genetic improvement seed oil content.
