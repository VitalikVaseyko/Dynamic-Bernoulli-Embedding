 1. comparative study carried blood glucose partition glucose metabolism penguin erythrocytes somatic tissues. Pygoscelidae penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica P. papua) used experiments. 2. Blood glucose partition established assaying whole blood plasma glucose several individuals gentoo chinstrap penguins. 3. found almost whole blood sugar compartmentalized plasma site, red blood cells ineffective regard glucose metabolism. 4. Levels hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphopyruvate hydratase (enolase), pyruvate kinase, alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase fructose bisphosphate phosphatase estimated erythrocytes gentoo chinstrap penguins, determinations carried also somatic tissues (leg muscle, breast muscle, heart muscle, liver brain) gentoo.
