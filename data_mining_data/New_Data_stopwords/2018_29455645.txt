 Originally identified metabolic enzyme catalyzes transfer phosphate group phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP glycolytic pathway, pyruvate kinase M2-type (PKM2) shown exhibit novel biological activities nucleus outside cells. Although cell-based studies reveal new non-canonical functions PKM2 gene transcription, epigenetic modulation cell cycle progression, importance non-canonical functions PKM2-mediated tumorigenesis still debate studies genetically modified mice consistently echo findings observed cultured cancer cells. addition regulation gene expression, existence PKM2 exosomes opens new venue study potential role glycolytic enzyme cell-cell communication extracellular signal initiation. review, briefly summarize current understanding PKM2 metabolic switch gene regulation. emphasize recent progress PKM2 extracellular signaling tumor microenvironment reprogramming. Finally, discrepancy PKM2's functions vitro vivo, application PKM2 cancer detection treatment discussed.
