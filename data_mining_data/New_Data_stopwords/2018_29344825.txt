 Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) key mitochondrial protein. VDAC drives cellular energy metabolism controlling influx efflux metabolites ions mitochondrial membrane, playing role permeabilization. protein exerts pivotal role white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection shrimp, involvement particular metabolism plays favor virus, Warburg effect. Warburg effect corresponds atypical metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis provides energy rapid cell division resistance apoptosis. Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, Warburg effect occurs infection Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1). present, role VDAC Warburg effect, OsHV-1 infection apoptosis unknown. Here, developed specific antibody directed C. gigas VDAC. tool allowed us quantify tissue-specific expression VDAC, detect VDAC oligomers, follow amount VDAC oysters deployed field. showed oysters sensitive mortality event field presented accumulation VDAC. Finally, propose use VDAC quantification tool measure oyster susceptibility OsHV-1 depending environment.
