 PKM2 important target designing anticancer drug. Inhibitors activators enzyme suitable molecules use treating cancer. aim present study investigate effect certain flavones PKM2. Apigenin, wogonin, flavone, 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, 6-hydroxyflavone, 7-hydroxyflavone effectively inhibited PKM2, IC50 range 0.99-2.120 muM. kinetic study indicated compounds acted noncompetitive Ki values 3.53-5.67 muM toward phosphoenolpyruvate. Scutellarin tangeritin demonstrated strong activation effect AC50 values < 2 muM. Diosmetin, baicalin, baicalein, luteolin showed intermediate-level activator effect. results demonstrate flavone analogs could serve leading compounds develop new potent selective inhibitor activator PKM2.
