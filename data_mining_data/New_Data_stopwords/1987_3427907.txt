 Kinetic studies carried reaction catalyzed pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate phosphotransferase, E.C. 2.7.1.40) purified white striated (epaxial) muscle two marine fish Mugil lisa (Brazilian mullet) Chaetoditerus faber (harvest fish). included establishment kinetic parameters. Attention given effect fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-P2) PK activity. Effects ATP, alanine divalent ions, Mg2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Be2+ Co2+, fish muscle enzyme also studied.
