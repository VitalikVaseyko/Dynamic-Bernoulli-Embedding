 UNLABELLED: Considerable effort made elucidating mechanism functional significance high levels aerobic glycolysis cancer cells, commonly referred Warburg effect. investigated whether gluconeogenic pathway significantly modulated hepatocarcinogenesis, resulting altered levels glucose homeostasis. test possibility, used mouse model (mice fed choline-deficient diet) develops nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), preneoplastic nodules, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), along human primary HCCs HCC cells. study demonstrated marked reduction expressions G6pc, Pepck, Fbp1 encoding key gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1,6-phosphatase, respectively, transcription factor Pgc-1alpha HCCs developed mouse model correlated reduction serum glucose tumor-bearing mice. messenger RNA (mRNA) levels genes also reduced approximately 80% majority primary human HCCs compared matching peritumoral livers. expression microRNA (miR)-23a, candidate miR targeting PGC-1alpha G6PC, up-regulated mouse liver tumors well primary human HCC. confirmed PGC-1alpha G6PC direct targets miR-23a expressions negatively correlated miR-23a expression human HCCs. G6PC expression also correlated tumor grade human primary HCCs. Finally, study showed activation interleukin (IL)-6-Stat3 signaling caused up-regulation miR-23a expression HCC. CONCLUSION: Based data, conclude gluconeogenesis severely compromised HCC IL6-Stat3-mediated activation miR-23a, directly targets PGC-1alpha G6PC, leading decreased glucose production.
