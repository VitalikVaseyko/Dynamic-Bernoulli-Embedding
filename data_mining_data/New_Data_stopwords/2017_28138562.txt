 Amphetamine (AMPH) methamphetamine (METH) abuse cause oxidative damage risk factor diseases including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) AMPH-associated-PAH patients show DNA damage judged gammaH2AX foci DNA comet tails. therefore hypothesized AMPH induces DNA damage vascular pathology interfering normal adaptation environmental perturbation causing oxidative stress. Consistent this, found AMPH alone cause DNA damage normoxic PAECs, greatly amplifies DNA damage hypoxic PAECs. mechanism involves AMPH activation protein phosphatase 2A, potentiates inhibition Akt. increases sirtuin 1, causing deacetylation degradation HIF1alpha, thereby impairing transcriptional activity, resulting reduction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 impaired cytochrome c oxidase 4 isoform switch. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inappropriately enhanced and, result impaired electron transport mitochondrial ROS increase, caspase-3 activated DNA damage induced. mice given binge doses METH followed hypoxia, HIF1alpha suppressed pulmonary artery DNA damage foci associated worse pulmonary vascular remodeling. Thus, chronic AMPH/METH induce DNA damage associated vascular disease subverting adaptive responses oxidative stress.
