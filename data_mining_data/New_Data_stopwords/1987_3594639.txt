 Celiptium (Ce) antitumor drug used therapy breast carcinomas, large extent dependent estrogens. studied effect Ce proteins induced estradiol (E2) rat uterus. observed Ce administered time E2, able inhibit induction E2 fetal thymidine kinase (TK-F), creatine kinase brain-type (CK-BB) progesterone receptor (PR). Ce given E2, inhibitory effects less evident. Results seemed indicate Ce could bind acceptor sites E2 receptor thus inhibit activity E2-regulated genes. assumption corroborated fact Ce modify activity enzymes submitted E2 regulation.
