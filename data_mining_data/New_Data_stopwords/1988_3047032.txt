 Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase isolated rat pancreatic islets shown regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. Broad-specificity phosphoprotein phosphatase treatment stimulated ATP addition inhibited activities. kinases responsible inactivating complexes shown sensitive inhibition known inhibitors, alpha-chloroisocaproate dichloroacetate. Total activity (nmol/min/islet / 37 degrees C) branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase 0.86 5.09, % active form (activity phosphatase treatment divided activity phosphatase treatment X 100) 36% 94%, respectively. Incubation intact isolated islets alpha-chloroisocaproate affected neither insulin release flux branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase.
