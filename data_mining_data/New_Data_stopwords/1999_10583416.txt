 isoxazole derivative Leflunomide (HWA 486) novel immunoregulatory anti-inflammatory drug. Affinity chromatography used purify identify Leflunomide binding proteins, might play role potential cellular targets molecular mode action. Leflunomide derivative 0273 covalently coupled Fractogel(R) matrix. column used separate cytosolic protein extract macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 several selected specific gradient elution steps. Proteins specifically eluted active metabolite Leflunomide, 1726, identified subsequent protein sequence analysis. allowed us specify 10 cytosolic proteins, bind high affinity matrix. Three them, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase phosphoglycerate mutase belong second part glycolytic pathway. binding specificity protein/drug interactions evaluated using BIAcore(R) analysis. Kd values glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase lactic dehydrogenase similar Kd value known Leflunomide target protein, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. order elucidate features well overall relevance results, cytosolic fractions three additional cell lines MOLT-4, A20.2J, HeLa compared using chromatographic protocol. elution profiles well subsequent Western blot analyses confirmed data obtained previously macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.
