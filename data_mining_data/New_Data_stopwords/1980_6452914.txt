 suggest temporal oscillations concentrations intermediates biochemical reaction systems may enhance efficiency free energy conversion (reduce dissipation) reactions. Experiments glycolysis used estimate Gibbs free energy changes along glycolysis mechanism, postulate construct glycolysis "machine" involves: PFK reaction primary oscillophor; GAPDH reaction phase-shifting device; PK reaction property intrinsic oscillatory response resonance driving frequency. Analysis simple reaction mechanism postulated properties shows conversion free energy reactants products efficient oscillatory steady state operation. efficiency free energy conversion glycolysis glucose + ADP products + ATP estimated increased 5--10% due oscillations. may relevant evolutionary development oscillations glycolysis, especially anaerobic cells.
