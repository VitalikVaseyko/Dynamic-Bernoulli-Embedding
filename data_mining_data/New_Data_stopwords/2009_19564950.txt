 Mitochondrial dysfunction hallmark almost diseases. Acquired inherited mutations mitochondrial genome DNA may give rise mitochondrial diseases. Another class disorders, mitochondrial impairments initiated extramitochondrial factors, includes neurodegenerative diseases syndromes resulting typical pathological processes, hypoxia/ischemia, inflammation, intoxications, carcinogenesis. classes diseases lead cellular energetic depression (CED), characterized decreased cytosolic phosphorylation potential suppresses cell's ability work control intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis redox state. progressing, CED leads cell death, whose type linked functional status mitochondria. case limited deterioration, amounts ATP still generated due oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondria launch apoptotic cell death program release cytochrome c. Following pronounced CED, cytoplasmic ATP levels fall thresholds required processing ATP-dependent apoptotic cascade cell dies necrosis. types death grouped together mitochondrial cell death (MCD). However, exist multiple adaptive reactions aimed protecting cells CED. context, metabolic shift characterized suppression OXPHOS combined activation aerobic glycolysis main pathway ATP synthesis (Warburg effect) central importance. Whereas type adaptation sufficiently effective avoid CED control cellular redox state, thereby ensuring cell survival, also favors avoidance apoptotic cell death. scenario may underlie uncontrolled cellular proliferation growth, eventually resulting carcinogenesis.
