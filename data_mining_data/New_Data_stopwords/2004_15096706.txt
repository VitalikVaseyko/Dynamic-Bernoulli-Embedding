 Cancer cells display heterogeneous genetic characteristics, depending tumor dynamic microenvironment. Abnormal tumor vasculature poor tissue oxygenation generate fraction hypoxic tumor cells selective advantages metastasis invasion often resist chemo- radiation therapies. genetic alterations acquired tumors modify biochemical pathways, results abnormal tumor metabolism. elevation glycolysis known "Warburg effect" changes lipid synthesis oxidation occur. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) used study tumor metabolism preclinical animal models clinical research human breast, brain, prostate cancers. technique identify specific genetic metabolic changes occur malignant tumors. Therefore, metabolic markers, detectable MRS, provide information biochemical changes also define different metabolic tumor phenotypes. combined contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), high sensitivity cancer diagnosis, vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) improves diagnostic specificity malignant human cancers becoming important clinical tool cancer management care. article reviews MRSI techniques molecular imaging methods detect quantify metabolic changes various tumor tissue types, especially extracranial tumor tissues contain high concentrations fat. MRI/MRSI methods used characterize tumor microenvironments terms blood volume vessel permeability. Measurements tissue oxygenation glycolytic rates MRS also described illustrate capability MR technology probing molecular information non-invasively tumor tissues important potential studying molecular mechanisms human cancers physiological conditions.
