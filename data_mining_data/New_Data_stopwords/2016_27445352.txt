 accommodate pronounced metabolic response digestion, pythons increase heart rate elevate stroke volume, latter ascribed massive fast cardiac hypertrophy. However, numerous recent studies show heart mass rarely increases, even upon ingestion large meals, therefore explored possibility rise mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) serves elevate venous pressure cardiac filling digestion. end, measured blood flows pressures anaesthetized Python regius anaesthetized snakes exhibited archetypal tachycardia well rise venous pressure MCFP fully account approximate doubling stroke volume. rise blood volume elevated MCFP must therefore stem increased vascular tone, possibly means increased sympathetic tone veins. Furthermore, although venous pressure MCFP increased volume loading, evidence postprandial hearts endowed additional capacity elevate stroke volume. vitro measurements force development paced ventricular strips also failed reveal signs increased contractility, postprandial hearts higher activities cytochrome oxidase pyruvate kinase, probably serves sustain rise cardiac work digestion.
