 Malaria major cause childhood death throughout much tropical world. result, exerted powerful force evolutionary selection genes confer survival advantage. Identifying genes involved, affect malaria risk, potentially useful way exploring host-parasite relationship. date, best-described malaria-protective polymorphisms relate genes affect structure function red blood cells (RBC). Recent years seen significant advances understanding importance genes, including glycophorin C (GYPC); complement receptor 1 (CR1); band 3 (SLC4A1); pyruvate kinase (Pklr); genes alpha-(HBA) beta-globin (HBB). challenge future must convert advances fresh approaches prevention treatment malaria.
