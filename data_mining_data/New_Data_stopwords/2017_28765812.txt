 high intake products containing fructose known mediate insulin resistance. liver, AMPD2, isoform AMPD, important glucose metabolic homeostasis functions including maintenance AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). speculated AMPD2 induces impaired glucose tolerance individuals consume high-fructose diet. gave either normal-chow (NCD) high-fructose (HFrD) diet 40 days 8-week-old male wild-type (WT) Ampd2 -/- homozygote (A2 -/-) C57BL/6 mice. glucose tolerance test (GTT) pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) used evaluate glucose metabolism. addition, gluconeogenesis glycolysis enzymes, AMPK phosphorylation liver investigated. consumption HFrD, A2 -/- mice showed enhanced glucose tolerance GTT PTT results compared WT mice, independent changes body weight. Also, levels phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase glucose-6-phosphatase (hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes) significantly reduced A2 -/- compared WT mice. hepatic glycolytic enzymes glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase also examined, though significant differences genotypes regard mRNA expression protein expression HFrD. Surprisingly, hepatic AMPK phosphorylation resulted changes A2 -/- compared WT mice conditions. results indicated Ampd2-deficient mice protected high fructose diet-induced glycemic dysregulation, mainly gluconeogenesis inhibition, indicate novel therapeutic target type 2 diabetes mellitus.
