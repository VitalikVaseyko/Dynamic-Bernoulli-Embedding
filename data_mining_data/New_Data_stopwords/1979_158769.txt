 14 days, SPF male Wistar rats initial weight 60 g given isocaloric diets (1.7 MJ/100 g diet) containing 10% protein (casein) 5, 10, 25 40% fat (margarine). Two utilization parameters protein biological value--net protein utilization (NPU) liver protein utilization (LPU)--were determined protein intake body liver nitrogen. results supplemented study course antithetical processes gluconeogenesis glycolysis, citric acid cycle transamination processes liver muscle amino acid spectrum. high (40%) fat diet significantly reduced protein biological value parameters NPU LPU liver muscle amino acid values, stimulated gluconeogenesis inhibited glycolysis citric acid cycle, together associated transamination processes liver. Activation processes muscles provided substrates increased gluconeogenesis. negative effect low fat + high carbohydrate diet less marked. optimum diet weaned rats thus diet containing 10% protein 10--25% fat. study, submits several possible ways determining optimum nutrient intakes different physiological conditions shows diets detailed nutrient concentrations used.
