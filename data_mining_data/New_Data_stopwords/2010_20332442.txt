 UNLABELLED: aim study investigate diagnostic value tumor M2 pyrurate kinase (Tu-M2-PK) tumor marker patients pre-invasive (CIN), invasive (PCC) recurrent (RCC) cervical cancer. MATERIALS METHODS: Plasma samples investigated 125 patients, comprising 50 cases CIN (I-III), 51 PCC (FIGO I-IV) 24 RCC, treatment. Tu-M2-PK levels determined using quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: increase disease severity CIN PCC RCC, levels Tu-M2-PK significantly increased (p<0.001). Levels Tu-M2-PK significantly increased respect FIGO stage (p<0.001) significantly higher values node+ patients (p=0.028). significant difference Tu-M2-PK levels CIN I-III patients (p=0.626). Patients distant metastasis significantly elevated levels Tu-M2-PK (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Tu-M2-PK used marker differentiate malignant premalignant cervical lesions. addition, concentration Tu-M2-PK correlates clinical stage disease.
