 Metabolic reprogramming hallmark cancer cells used cancer cells growth survival. Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2) limiting glycolytic enzyme catalyzes final step glycolysis, key tumor metabolism growth. present review discusses expression regulation PKM2, reports dominant role PKM2 plays glycolysis achieve nutrient demands cancer cell proliferation. addition, present study discusses non-metabolic function PKM2, role coactivator protein kinase, contributes tumorigenesis. Furthermore, conflicting studies concerning role PKM2 therapeutic target reviewed. improved understanding PKM2 may provide noval approach cancer treatment.
