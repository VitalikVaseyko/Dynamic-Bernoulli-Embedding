 recently showed biotin starvation yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nematode Caenorhabditis elegans rat Rattus norvegicus, despite abundant glucose provision, expression genes glucose utilization lipogenesis lowered, fatty acid beta-oxidation gluconeogenesis raised, glycolytic/fermentative flow reduced. work explored mechanisms results. show associated ATP deficit activation energy stress sensor AMP kinase (AMPK; Snf1 yeast). Analysis microarray results revealed extensive changes transcripts signal transduction pathways transcription factors AMPK, SREBP-1c, ChREBP, NAMPT, PGC-1alpha, mTORC1 rat, homologs worm. yeast altered factor transcripts Adr1, Cat8, Sip4, Mig1, HXK2, Rgt1. insulin pathway negatively enriched (in rat worm), whereas adiponectins JAK/STAT pathways increased (present rat; activate AMPK). Together, changes explain effects biotin starvation glucose utilization, energy status carbon metabolism gene expression coherent manner across three phylogenetically distant eukaryotes may clinical significance humans, since effects reminiscent insulin resistance. propose general model integrating results regulatory circuitries, according biology species, based impaired anaplerosis due pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, basic underlying logic. preliminary test yeast, aspartate corrects alterations produced biotin starvation.
