 Tpr 267-kDa protein unknown function recently identified constitutive component nuclear pore complex (NPC2)-attached intranuclear filaments. Secondary structure predictions suggest protein divided large, coiled-coil forming aminoterminal domain shorter, highly acidic carboxyterminal domain. identify Tpr's molecular segments determine specific intranuclear localization, constructed expression vectors encoding various Tpr deletion mutants well chimeric combinations Tpr sequences soluble cytoplasmic protein pyruvate kinase. Following transfection cultured mammalian cells, identified short region within Tpr's carboxyterminal domain essential sufficient mediate nuclear import Tpr also confer nuclear accumulation pyruvate kinase. Tpr deletion mutants contain nuclear targeting segment, lack aminoterminal domain, appear evenly dispersed throughout nucleus without noticeable association NPC. contrast, aminoterminal domain lacking carboxyterminal region remains located within cytoplasm, forming aggregate-like structures associated nuclear envelope. However, tagged Tpr's short nuclear targeting segment nuclear localization signal SV40 large protein, aminoterminal domain imported nucleus, associates NPC. association mediated shorter molecular segments within aminoterminal domain contain clusters heptad repeats, whereas regions dispensable. assignment different topogenetic properties distinct molecular segments Tpr allow design future experiments study protein's structural properties determine actual function.
