 mapped human mouse X chromosome-specific genomic cDNA probes interspecies Mus musculus/spretus pedigree contains mdx mutation. positions markers relative one another mdx mutation delineated. Using probes corresponding segments human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene transcript, position cross-hybridizing mouse equivalent gene (mDMD) located. 200 animals mapped, three identified show recombination within mDMD gene. Analysis three animals shows mDMD gene oriented 5' end centromeric 3' end telomeric mouse X chromosome. Furthermore, recombinational breakpoints either side mdx mutation, thus providing first unequivocal demonstration mdx mutation located within mDMD gene defining limits within gene mutation must lie. Within segment evidence indicates major deletion exon detectable Southern blot analysis mdx animals. mdx mouse becomes important animal model study expression DMD gene developmental consequences, transgenic corrective manipulations.
