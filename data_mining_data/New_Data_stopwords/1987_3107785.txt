 ability carbohydrate fuels (lactate, pyruvate, glucose) ketone bodies (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate) compete fatty acids fuels respiration isolated Langendorf-perfused heart studied. Oleate octanoate used fatty acid fuels since oleate requires carnitine entry mitochondria, whereas octanoate not. two ketone bodies inhibited oxidation oleate octanoate implying intramitochondrial site action. Pyruvate, lactate, lactate plus glucose inhibited oleate oxidation octanoate oxidation, indicating mechanism inhibition involves carnitine system. Pyruvate potent inhibitor lactate equal concentrations, effect lactate could greatly increased dichloroacetate, inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. physiological mechanistic implications observations discussed.
