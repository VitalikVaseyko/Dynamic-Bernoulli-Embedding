 article describes synthesis labels hapten-protein conjugates use bio- chemiluminescent immunoassay systems, together problems encountered. effects maleimide upon acetate-, adenylate- pyruvate kinase activity studied, well upon luciferin-luciferase monitoring system. Maleimide inhibited acetate adenylate kinase showed inhibition pyruvate kinase monitoring reagent. Four heterobifunctional reagents tested capability forming pyruvate kinase-donkey-anti-rabbit IgG conjugates retained enzyme antibody activity. best results obtained succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate succinimidyl-6-(p-maleimidophenyl)-hexanoate. relationship amounts succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate IgG studied respect enzymic activity conjugate. Michaelis-Menten constants conjugated non-conjugated pyruvate kinase calculated compared. found maximal velocity (Vmax) conjugated enzyme lower non-conjugated enzyme although "apparent" Km value conjugated non-conjugated pyruvate kinase. pyruvate kinase-anti rabbit IgG conjugate tested ability bind rabbit-IgG coated polystyrene balls. addition bioluminescent labels, synthesis chemiluminescent markers undertaken optimised. three substances used labelling diazoluminol, diazoisoluminol N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol hemisuccinamide latter used N-hydroxysuccinamide "active" ester. ratio label IgG studied diazoluminol N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol hemisuccinamide active ester discovered diazoisoluminol suitable coupling antibodies. optimal molar ratios label: IgG diazoluminol 40:1 N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol hemisuccinamide active ester 60:1. Increasing substitution rate led lessening dynamic range, shown increase ratio unspecific binding (noise) maximal binding (signal) assay. synthesis hapten-protein conjugates covalent coupling polystyrene balls undertaken formed part preparation assays described Part III. optimal production gentamicin-bovine serum albumin thyroxine-transferrin conjugates described detail.
