 32P-labeled glucose 6-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate injected oocytes, fertilized eggs, early embryos Xenopus laevis, 32P label followed glycolytic enzymes acid-soluble metabolites. kinetics labeling phosphoglucomutase phosphoglyceromutase formation specific metabolites used measure carbon flux glycolytic intermediates cells. full-grown stage VI oocytes, fertilized eggs, cells cleaving embryos, carbon metabolism glycogenic direction. Glycolytic intermediates injected cells metabolized UDP-glucose presumably glycogen. Carbon flow phosphoenolpyruvate glucose 6-phosphate utilize fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase; rather, may depend largely enzymes pentose phosphate pathway. Maturation fertilization oocyte result change qualitative pattern metabolites formed. Pyruvate kinase, although abundant oocytes embryos, essentially inactive cells. Pyruvate kinase also appears inactive small previtellogenic stage II oocytes; however, cells injected glycolytic intermediates metabolized UDP-glucose.
