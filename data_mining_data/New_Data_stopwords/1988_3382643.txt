 Membranes intact erythrocytes labeled fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) using improved labeling procedure described previously (Plasek, J. Jarolim, P. (1987) Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 6, 425-437). relationship steady-state DPH fluorescence anisotropy r mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) studied. Fluorescence anisotropy increased increasing MCHC. linear dependence r = 0.0026 (MCHC) + 0.113 obtained enabled us measure fluidity intact red cell membranes. Without correction fluorescence quenching hemoglobin, incorrect conclusions membrane fluidity could made. fact demonstrated group pyruvate kinase deficient patients compared group healthy blood donors.
