 Boron (B) deficiency widespread problem many crops, including Citrus. effects B-deficiency gas exchange, carbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, total soluble proteins phenolics, activities key enzymes involved organic acid amino acid metabolism 'Xuegan' [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] leaves roots investigated. Boron-deficient leaves displayed excessive accumulation nonstructural carbohydrates much lower CO2 assimilation, demonstrating feedback inhibition photosynthesis. Dark respiration, concentrations organic acids [i.e., malate, citrate, oxaloacetate (OAA), pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate] activities enzymes [i.e., phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), NAD-malate dehydrogenase, NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), NADP-ME, pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase (PEPP), citrate synthase (CS), aconitase (ACO), NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-IDH) hexokinase] involved glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle anapleurotic reaction higher B-deficient leaves controls. Also, total free amino acid (TFAA) concentration related enzyme [i.e., NADH-dependent glutamate 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (NADH-GOGAT) glutamate OAA transaminase (GOT)] activities enhanced B-deficient leaves. contrast, respiration, concentrations nonstructural carbohydrates three organic acids (malate, citrate pyruvate), activities enzymes [i.e., PEPC, NADP-ME, PK, PEPP, CS, ACO, NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADP-IDH hexokinase] involved glycolysis, TCA cycle anapleurotic reaction, well concentration TFAA activities related enzymes (i.e., nitrate reductase, NADH-GOGAT, glutamate pyruvate transaminase glutamine synthetase) lower B-deficient roots controls. Interestingly, leaf root concentration total phenolics increased, whereas total soluble protein decreased, response B-deficiency. conclusion, respiration, organic acid (i.e., glycolysis TCA cycle) metabolism, anapleurotic pathway amino acid biosynthesis upregulated B-deficient leaves excessive accumulation carbohydrates 'consume' excessive carbon available, downregulated B-deficient roots less accumulation carbohydrates maintain net carbon balance.
