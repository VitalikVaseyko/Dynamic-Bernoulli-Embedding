 Pyruvate,orthophosphate (Pi) dikinase (PPDK) best recognized chloroplastic C(4) cycle enzyme. one key regulatory foci controlling flux photosynthetic pathway, strictly reversibly regulated light. light/dark modulation mediated reversible phosphorylation conserved threonine residue active-site domain PPDK regulatory protein (RP), bifunctional protein kinase/phosphatase. PPDK also present C(3) plants, although known photosynthetic function. Nevertheless, report show C(3) PPDK leaves several angiosperms isolated intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts undergoes light-/dark-induced changes phosphorylation state manner similar C(4) dikinase. addition, kinetics process closely resemble reversible C(4) process, light-induced dephosphorylation occurring rapidly (< =15 min) dark-induced phosphorylation occurring much slowly (> =30-60 min). intact spinach chloroplasts, light-induced dephosphorylation C(3) PPDK shown dependent exogenous Pi photosystem II activity independent electron transfer photosystem I. organello results implicate role stromal pools Pi adenylates regulating reversible phosphorylation C(3)-PPDK. Last, used vitro RP assay directly demonstrate ADP-dependent PPDK phosphorylation desalted leaf extracts C(3) plants Vicia faba rice (Oryza sativa). conclude RP-like activity mediates light/dark modulation PPDK phosphorylation state C(3) leaves chloroplasts likely represents ancestral isoform unusual key C(4) pathway regulatory "converter" enzyme.
