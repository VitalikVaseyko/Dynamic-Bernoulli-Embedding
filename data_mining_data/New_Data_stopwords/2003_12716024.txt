 Elevated production hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) central nervous system implicated pathogenesis several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic reperfusion, stroke, Alzheimer's disease. Pyruvic acid critical role energy metabolism capability nonenzymatically decarboxylate H2O2 H2O. study examined effects glycolytic regulation pyruvic acid H2O2 toxicity murine neuroblastoma cells. Glycolytic energy substrates including D-(+)-glucose, D-(-) fructose adenosine transport blocker dipyridamole, effective providing protection H2O2 toxicity, negating energy factor. hand, pyruvic acid completely prevented H2O2 toxicity, restoring loss ATP cell viability. H2O2 toxicity also attenuated D-fructose 1,6 diphosphate (FBP), phospho (enol) pyruvate (PEP), niacinamide, beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (beta-NAD+), reduced form (beta-NADH). FBP PEP exerted positive kinetic effects pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Interestingly, pyruvic acid beta-NADH exhibited powerful stoichiometric H2O2 antioxidant properties. Further, beta-NADH may exert positive effects PK activity. Subsequent pyruvic acid accumulation lead recycling beta-NAD+ lactate dehydrogenase beta-NADH glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. concluded studies intracellular pyruvic acid beta-NADH appear act concert glycolysis, enhance H2O2 intracellular antioxidant capacity neuroblastoma cells. Future research required examine whether similar effects observed primary neuronal culture intact tissue.
