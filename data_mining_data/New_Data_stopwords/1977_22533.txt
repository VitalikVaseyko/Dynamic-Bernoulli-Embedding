 Muscle biopsies taken m. quadriceps femoris man immediately termination dynamic isometric exercise. analyzed adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5'-phosphate (AMP), phosphorylcreatine (PC), creatine, pyruvate lactate. Regardless type, intensity, duration preceding exercise, general pattern relation high-energy phosphates lactate content could observed. PG showed nonlinear relationship muscle lactate content. ratio ATP ADP appeared decrease linearly lactate content increased. relationships believed consequence steady-state condition muscle pH one major determining factors.
