 BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) encompasses genetic disorders iron overload characterized deficient expression function iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Mutations 5 genes linked disease: HFE, TFR2 (encoding transferrin receptor 2), HAMP (encoding hepcidin), SLC40A1 (encoding ferroportin) HJV (encoding hemojuvelin). Hepcidin inhibits iron export cells plasma. Hemojuvelin, upstream regulator hepcidin expression, expressed mice mainly heart skeletal muscle. suggested soluble hemojuvelin shed muscle might reach liver influence hepcidin expression. Heart muscle one target tissues affected iron overload, resultant cardiomyopathy HH patients. Therefore, investigated effect iron overload gene expression skeletal muscle heart using Illuminatrade mark arrays containing 47,000 probes. apparent changes gene expression confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Genes up-regulated expression iron overload skeletal heart muscle included angiopoietin-like 4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 calgranulin B. expression transferrin receptor, heat shock protein 1B DnaJ homolog B1 down-regulated iron muscle types. Two potential hepcidin regulatory genes, hemojuvelin neogenin, showed clear change expression iron overload. CONCLUSION: Microarray analysis revealed iron-induced changes expression several genes involved regulation glucose lipid metabolism, transcription cellular stress responses. may represent novel connections iron overload pathological manifestations HH cardiomyopathy diabetes.
