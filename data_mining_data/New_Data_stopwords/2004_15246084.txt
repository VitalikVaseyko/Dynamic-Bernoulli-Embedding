 novel bacterial vivo selection pyruvate aldolase activity described. Pyruvate kinase deficient cells, lack ability biosynthetically generate pyruvate, require supplementation exogenous pyruvate grown ribose. Supplementation pyruvate concentrations low 50 microM rescues cell growth. known substrate KDPG aldolases, 2-keto-4-hydroxy-4-(2'-pyridyl)butyrate (KHPB), also rescues cell growth, consistent retroaldol cleavage KDPG aldolase rescue pyruvate release. initial round selection 2-keto-4-hydroxyoctonate (KHO), nonsubstrate wild-type aldolase, produced three mutants intriguing alterations protein sequence. selection system allows rapid screening mutant enzyme libraries facilitates discovery enzymes novel substrate specificities.
