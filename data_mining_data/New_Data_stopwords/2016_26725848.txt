 Reprogramming cellular metabolism hallmark feature cancer cells. distinct set processes drive metastasis compared tumorigenesis, yet unclear genetic alterations metabolic pathways associated metastatic progression human cancers. Here, analyzed mutation, copy number variation gene expression patterns literature-derived model metabolic genes associated glycolysis (Warburg effect), fatty acid metabolism (lipogenesis, oxidation, lipolysis, esterification) fatty acid uptake >9000 primary metastatic tumor samples multi-cancer TCGA datasets. association analysis revealed uniform pattern Warburg effect mutations influencing prognosis across tumor types, copy number alterations electron transport chain gene SCO2, fatty acid uptake (CAV1, CD36) lipogenesis (PPARA, PPARD, MLXIPL) genes enriched metastatic tumors. Using gene expression profiles, established gene-signature (CAV1, CD36, MLXIPL, CPT1C, CYP2E1) strongly associated epithelial-mesenchymal program across multiple cancers. Moreover, stratification samples based copy number expression profiles genes identified analysis revealed significant effect patient survival rates, thus confirming prominent roles fatty acid uptake metabolism metastatic progression poor prognosis human cancers.
