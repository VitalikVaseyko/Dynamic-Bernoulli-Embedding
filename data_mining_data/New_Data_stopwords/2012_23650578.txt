 studied adipocytes 8-week-old control rat offspring (CON) rat offspring subjected maternal low (8%) protein (MLP) feeding pregnancy/lactation, procedure predisposing obesity. Acute exposure isoproterenol adenosine enhanced PDK4 PPARgamma mRNA gene expression CON MLP adipocytes. Enhanced adipocyte Pdk4 expression correlated increased PPARgamma expression. Higher levels PDK4 PPARgamma observed MLP adipocytes. SCD1 PPARgamma target. Isoproterenol enhanced adipocyte PDK4 SCD1 gene expression parallel. could reflect augmented PPARgamma expression together enhanced lipolytic stimulation supply endogenous PPARgamma ligands, allowing enhanced adipocyte PDK4 SCD1 expression via PPARgamma activation. contrast, effect adenosine increase PDK4 expression independent stimulation lipolysis and, SCD1 expression unaffected adenosine, unlikely reflect PPARgamma activation. Increased adipocyte expression PDK4 SCD1 MLP model could participate components "thrifty" phenotype, favouring development obesity.
