 Knowledge genetic relationships beta-D-N-acetylhexosaminidases B (EC 3.2.1.30) may help understanding hexosaminidase deficiency associated GM(2) gangliosidosis, fatal lipid storage disease man. use man-mouse somatic cell hybrids found gene involved hexosaminidase expression linked genes coding mannosephosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase-3. gene coding hexosaminidase B linked genes coding 25 enzyme markers tested. combination immunological electrophoretic techniques employed identify human hexosaminidases B certainty cell hybrids. Discordant segregation hexosaminidase hexosaminidase B 60 clones indicated genes coding expression linked. However, hexosaminidase never expressed cell hybrids absence hexosaminidase B. suggests gene responsible hexosaminidase phenotype, linked mannosephosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase-3, requires presence gene coding hexosaminidase B expression hexosaminidase A. observations offer genetic explanation biochemical immunological relationships hexosaminidases B provide framework identifying basic genetic defects responsible GM(2) gangliosidosis.
