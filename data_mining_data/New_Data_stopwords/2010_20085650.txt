 BACKGROUND: cancer cells, contrast normal differentiated cells, rely aerobic glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation generate metabolic energy, phenomenon called Warburg effect. MODEL: Quantum metabolism analytic theory metabolic regulation exploits methodology quantum mechanics derive allometric rules relating cellular metabolic rate cell size. theory explains differences metabolic rates cells utilizing OxPhos cells utilizing glycolysis. article appeals analytic relation metabolic rate evolutionary entropy - demographic measure Darwinian fitness - order to: (a) provide evolutionary rationale Warburg effect, (b) propose methods based entropic principles natural selection regulating incidence OxPhos glycolysis cancer cells. CONCLUSION: regulatory interventions proposed basis quantum metabolism applications therapeutic strategies combat cancer. procedures, based metabolic regulation, non-invasive, complement standard therapeutic methods involving radiation chemotherapy.
