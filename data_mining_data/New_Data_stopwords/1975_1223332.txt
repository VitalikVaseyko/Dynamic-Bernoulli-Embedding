 simple method culture rat liver parenchymal cells described. Minced liver tissues dissociated pre-perfusion newly developed enzyme, bacterial neutral proteinase, cultured medium consisting 10% fetal calf serum 90% new synthetic medium, DM-153. adequate technique primary dissociation first subcultivation, parenchymal cells selected. Cultivation arginine-free medium also useful selecting them. cultured cells exhibited activities certain enzymes similar liver cells vivo. Cell strains successively established liver tissues embryo, suckling adult rats. Liver cells, however, cultured way, also used experiments early stage serial cultivation.
