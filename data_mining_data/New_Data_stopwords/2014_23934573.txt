 aripiprazole-treated PC12 cells, previously showed mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) rather increased spite lowered cytochrome c oxidase activity. address inconsistent results, focused NADPH generation glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), rate-limiting enzyme pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), titrate reactive oxygen species (ROS) results Deltapsim maintenance. G6PD may also involved another inconsistent result lowered intracellular lactate level aripiprazole-treated PC12 cells, PPP competes glucose-6-phosphate glycolytic pathway, resulting downregulation glycolysis. Therefore, assayed intracellular amounts NADPH, ROS, activities enzymes generating consuming NADPH (G6PD, NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme, glutathione reductase, NADPH oxidase [NOX]) estimated glycolysis 50 muM aripiprazole-, clozapine-, haloperidol-treated PC12 cells. NADPH levels enhanced aripiprazole-treated ones. haloperidol increased ROS. However, enzyme activities show significant changes toward enhancing NADPH level except aripiprazole-induced decrease NOX activity. Thus, lowered NOX activity could contributed aripiprazole-induced increase NADPH level lowering ROS generation, resulting maintained Deltapsim. Although aforementioned assumption invalid, ratio fructose-1,6-bisphosphate fructose-6-phosphate decreased antipsychotics examined. Pyruvate kinase activity enhanced aripiprazole. summary, observations indicate aripiprazole possibly possesses pharmacological superiority clozapine haloperidol ROS generation adjustment glycolytic pathway.
