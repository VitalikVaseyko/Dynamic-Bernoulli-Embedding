 Gastric cancer second leading cause cancer-related death worldwide. identification new cancer biomarkers necessary reduce mortality rates development new screening assays early diagnosis, well new target therapies. study, performed proteomic analysis noncardia gastric neoplasias individuals Northern Brazil. proteins analyzed two-dimensional electrophoresis mass spectrometry. identification differentially expressed proteins, used statistical tests bootstrapping resampling control type error multiple comparison analyses. identified 111 proteins involved gastric carcinogenesis. computational analysis revealed several proteins involved energy production processes reinforced Warburg effect gastric cancer. ENO1 HSPB1 expression evaluated. ENO1 selected due role aerobic glycolysis may contribute Warburg effect. Although observed two up-regulated spots ENO1 proteomic analysis, mean expression ENO1 reduced gastric tumors western blot. However, mean ENO1 expression seems increase invasive tumors. lack correlation proteomic western blot analyses may due presence ENO1 spots present slightly reduced expression, high impact mean protein expression. neoplasias, HSPB1 induced cellular stress protect cells apoptosis. present study, HSPB1 presented elevated protein mRNA expression subset gastric cancer samples. However, association observed HSPB1 expression clinicopathological characteristics. Here, identified several possible biomarkers gastric cancer individuals Northern Brazil. biomarkers may useful assessment prognosis stratification therapy validated larger clinical study sets.
