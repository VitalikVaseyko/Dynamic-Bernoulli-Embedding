 Considering thiol-containing enzymes like kinases critical several metabolic pathways energy homeostasis, investigated effects cystine dimethyl ester and/or cysteamine administration kinases crucial energy metabolism kidney Wistar rats. Animals injected twice day 1.6 micromol/g body weight cystine dimethyl ester and/or 0.26 micromol/g body weight cysteamine 16th 20th postpartum day euthanized 12 hours. Pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, creatine kinase activities thiol/disulfide ratio determined. Cystine dimethyl ester administration reduced thiol/disulfide ratio inhibited kinases activities. Cysteamine administration increased thiol/disulfide ratio co-administration cystine dimethyl ester prevented inhibition enzymes. Regression thiol/disulfide ratio, kinases activities significant. results suggest redox status may regulate energy metabolism rat kidney. thiol-containing enzymes inhibition oxidative stress occur patients cystinosis, possible lysosomal cystine depletion may beneficial effect cysteamine administration, also antioxidant thiol-protector effect.
