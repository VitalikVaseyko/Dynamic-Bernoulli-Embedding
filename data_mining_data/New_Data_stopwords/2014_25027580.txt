 HPV infection involved etiology 25 % head neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). postulated strong antitumoral immune response HPV-positive tumors represents important underlying mechanism good response therapy. Recently, Warburg phenomenon returned center attention affects antitumoral immune response response therapy. Accumulation tumor cell-derived lactate inhibits cytotoxic cells, these, analogous cancer cells, depend glycolysis lactate secretion fulfillment energy needs. Sparse information exists Warburg effect HNSCC. study aimed characterize metabolic immunological features HPV-negative HPV-positive HNSCC. immunohistochemical analysis oropharyngeal carcinomas showed enhanced antitumoral immune response (CD8/CD4 ratio) together increased levels proteins involved transmembranous metabolite transportation (GLUT1 CD147) respiratory metabolism (COX5B) HPV-positive tumors compared HPV-negative tumors. mRNA Western blot analyses HPV-positive HPV-negative HNSCC cell line revealed metabolic characteristics similar vivo situation. Additionally, HPV-negative cell line showed stronger extracellular lactate accumulation. contrast, HPV-positive cell line presented better adaption lactic acidosis suggesting ability metabolize lactate. results indicate HPV-positive HPV-negative carcinomas differ terms tumor immune microenvironment, also terms tumor metabolism, characterized increased glucose respiratory metabolism together decreased lactate accumulation HPV-positive HNSCC. Therefore, targeting metabolic pathways could represent promising adjunct therapy HPV-positive HNSCC.
