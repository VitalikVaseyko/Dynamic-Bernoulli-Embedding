 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) catalyzes interconversion lactate pyruvate glycolysis pathway. Cancer cells rely heavily glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation generate ATP, phenomenon known Warburg effect. inhibition LDH-A small molecules therefore interest potential cancer treatments. describe identification optimization LDH-A inhibitors fragment-based drug discovery. applied ligand based NMR screening identify low affinity fragments binding LDH-A. dissociation constants (K(d)) enzyme inhibition (IC(50)) fragment hits measured surface plasmon resonance (SPR) enzyme assays, respectively. binding modes selected fragments investigated X-ray crystallography. Fragment growing linking, followed chemical optimization, resulted nanomolar LDH-A inhibitors demonstrated stoichiometric binding LDH-A. Selected molecules inhibited lactate production cells, suggesting target-specific inhibition cancer cell lines.
