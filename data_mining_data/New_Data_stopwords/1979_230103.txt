 recent years become apparent increasing number proteins phosphorylated several different sites. article protein multisite phosphorylation discussed reference enzymes glycogen synthase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, phosphorylase kinase. enzymes contains three different phosphorylation sites one subunits. Activation inactivation enzymes appear correlate quite well phosphorylation key sites protein. phosphorylation sites may influence kinetic properties enzymes regulate rates dephosphorylation key sites appropriate phosphatase. Thus, multisite phosphorylation may represent important mechanism regulating several functions complex proteins.
