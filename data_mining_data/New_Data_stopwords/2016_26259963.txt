 biliary epithelial lesions primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), mitochondrial proteins associated deregulated autophagy abnormally expressed. examined whether could used diagnostic marker end-stage PBC recurrent PBC liver transplantation. examined expression mitochondrial protein pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-E2 component cytochrome c oxidase, subunit (CCO), autophagy-related marker microtubule-associated protein-light chain 3 (LC3), p62/sequestosome-1 senescence markers p16(Ink4a) p21(WAF1/Cip1) small bile ducts bile ductules explanted livers patients PBC (n = 20) comparison liver tissue control patients (n = 21) post-transplant samples including recurrent PBC cellular rejection (n = 28). Intense granular expression mitochondrial proteins significantly frequent small bile ducts explanted livers PBC control livers (p < 0.05). Post-transplant samples comprised three groups: group (positive mitochondrial proteins, n = 7), group B (positive either autophagy-related senescence markers negative mitochondrial proteins, n = 7), group C (all negative, n = 14). one case group clinically histologically diagnosed recurrent PBC. contrast, cases group B diagnosed cellular rejection. study suggests expression mitochondrial proteins small bile ducts may useful diagnostic marker end-stage PBC recurrent PBC liver transplantation.
