 Enzymopathies pyruvate kinase (PK) characterized polymorphism. Nine distinct variants L-type 10 patients suffering nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia identified electrophoretic kinetic methods. Typical changes electrophoretic mobility kinetic properties L-type K-type PK produced incubation cytolysates tissue homogenates presence trypsin. trypsinization three distinct forms L-type liver erythrocytes show identical mobility. Trypsinization haemolysates proved diagnostic tool differentiation PK variants. results also allow distinguish whether mutation located region peptide chain split trypsin not. three cases occurrence two instead one enzyme form trypsinization indicates double heterozygote heredity PK-deficiency. appearance K-type isoenzyme PK red blood cells may considered physiological event limited period erythropoiesis. K-isoenzyme found samples red blood cells containing erythroblasts. One patients shown still unknown form PK. properties form resembled major part PK human placenta.
