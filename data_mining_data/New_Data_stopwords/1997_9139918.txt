 characterized gene YOR347c Saccharomyces cerevisiae shown encodes second functional pyruvate kinase isoenzyme, Pyk2p. Overexpression YOR347c/PYK2 gene multicopy vector restored growth glucose yeast pyruvate kinase 1 (pyk1) mutant strain could completely substitute PYK1-encoded enzymatic activity. PYK2 gene expression subject glucose repression. pyk2 deletion mutant obvious growth phenotypes various conditions, growth defects pyk1 pyk2 double-deletion strain even pronounced pyk1 single-mutation strain. Pyk2p active without fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. However, overexpression PYK2 growth ethanol cause deleterious effects expected futile cycling pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate. results indicate PYK2-encoded pyruvate kinase may used conditions low glycolytic flux.
