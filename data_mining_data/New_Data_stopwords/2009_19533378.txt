 reverse-genetics approach applied identify genes involved Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) resistance, taking advantage two tomato inbred lines breeding program-one susceptible (S), one resistant (R-that used Solanum habrochaites source resistance. cDNA libraries inoculated non-inoculated R plants compared, postulating genes preferentially expressed R line may part network sustaining resistance TYLCV. Further, assumed silencing genes located important nodes network would lead collapse resistance. Approximately 70 different cDNAs representing genes preferentially expressed R plants isolated genes identified comparison public databases. Permease I-like protein gene encoding transmembranal transporter studied: preferentially expressed R plants expression enhanced several-fold following TYLCV inoculation. Silencing Permease gene R plants using Tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing led loss resistance, expressed development disease symptoms typical infected susceptible plants accumulation large amounts virus. Silencing another membrane protein gene preferentially expressed R plants, Pectin methylesterase, previously shown involved Tobacco mosaic virus translocation, lead collapse resistance R plants. Thus, silencing single gene lead collapse resistance, every gene preferentially expressed R line effect, upon silencing, resistance.
