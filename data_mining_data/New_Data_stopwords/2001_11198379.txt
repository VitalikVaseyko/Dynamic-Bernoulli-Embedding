 High glycolytic flux emergency pathway generating ATP recorded important metabolic pathway required success Biomphalaria-Schistosome sporocyst interaction. Effect LC25 dry powdered Ambrosia maritima (Damsissa) plant molluscicide hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase(PK), glucose phosphate isomerase(GPI) tested. resulted significant inhibition three investigated enzymes. Treatment snails LC10 concentrations A. maritima reduced considerably infection rate Biomphalaria alexandrina Schistosoma mansoni 34% compared infection rate 80% control non-treated snails. Longer prepatent period remarkable decrease cercarial production also recorded snails treated sublethal concentrations molluscicide.
