 mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase multi-enzyme complex contains tightly-associated 50 000-Mr polypeptide unknown function (component X) addition three constituent enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), lipoate acetyltransferase (E2) lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) jointly responsible production CoASAc NADH. presence component X apparent sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel analysis complex, performed Tris-glycine buffers although co-migrates E3 subunit standard phosphate gels run denaturing conditions. Refined immunological techniques, employing subunit-specific antisera individual components pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, demonstrated protein X proteolytic fragment E2 (or E3) suggested previously. addition, anti-X serum elicits cross-reaction either subunit intrinsic kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Immune-blotting analysis SDS extracts bovine, rat pig cell lines derived subcellular fractions indicated protein X normal cellular component specific mitochondrial location. remains tightly-associated 'core' enzyme, E2, dissociation complex pH 9.5 treatment 0.25 MgCl2. polypeptide released significant extent E2 p-hydroxymercuriphenyl sulphonate, reagent promotes dissociation specific kinase complex 'core' enzyme. Incubation complex [2-14C]pyruvate absence CoASH promotes incorporation radio-label, probably form acetyl groups, E2 component X.
