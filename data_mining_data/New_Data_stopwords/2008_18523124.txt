 Dominant-negative thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) show elevated expression relative ligand-binding TRs cardiac hypertrophy. tested hypothesis overexpression dominant-negative TR alters cardiac metabolism contractile efficiency (CE). used mice expressing cardioselective dominant-negative TRbeta(1) mutation Delta337T. Isolated working Delta337T hearts nontransgenic control (Con) hearts perfused (13)C-labeled free fatty acids (FFA), acetoacetate (ACAC), lactate, glucose physiological concentrations 30 min. (13)C NMR spectroscopy isotopomer analyses used determine substrate flux fractional contributions (Fc) acetyl-CoA citric acid cycle (CAC). Delta337T hearts exhibited rate depression higher developed pressure CE, defined work per oxygen consumption (MVo(2)). Unlabeled substrate Fc endogenous sources higher Delta337T, ACAC Fc lower. Fluxes CAC, lactate, ACAC, FFA reduced Delta337T. CE Fc differences reversed pacing Delta337T Con rates, accompanied increase FFA Fc. Delta337T hearts lacked ability increase MVo(2). Decreases protein expression glucose transporter-4 hexokinase-2 increases pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 -4 suggest hearts unable increase carbohydrate oxidation response stress. data show Delta337T alters metabolic phenotype murine heart reducing substrate flux multiple pathways. changes heart rate dependent, indicating substrate shift may represent accommodation altered contractile protein kinetics, disrupted pacing stress.
