 Acetate kinase (ACK) converts acetyl phosphate acetate along generation ATP pathway mixed-acid fermentation Lactococcus lactis. reverse reaction yields acetyl phosphate assimilation purposes. Remarkably, L. lactis two ACK isozymes, corresponding genes present operon. purified enzymes (AckA1 AckA2) L. lactis MG1363 determined oligomeric state, specific activities, allosteric regulation. proteins form homodimeric complexes, shown size exclusion chromatography static light-scattering measurements. turnover number AckA1 order magnitude higher AckA2 reaction either direction. Km values acetyl phosphate, ATP, ADP similar enzymes. However, AckA2 higher affinity acetate AckA1, suggesting important role acetate-limiting conditions despite lower activity. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, phospho-enol-pyruvate inhibit activities AckA1 AckA2 different extents. allosteric regulation AckA1 AckA2 pool sizes glycolytic intermediates consistent switch homolactic mixed-acid fermentation upon slowing growth rate.
