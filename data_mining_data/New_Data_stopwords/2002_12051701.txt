 demonstrate simply raising extracellular pyruvate levels, hence increasing metabolic supply, human diploid fibroblasts undergo concentration-dependent induction cellular senescence. Fibroblasts treated pyruvate undergo rapid growth arrest accompanied elevated levels cell-cycle regulatory molecules p53, p21, p16. cells also exhibit rise mitochondrial oxidant production fall intracellular glutathione levels. Exposure pyruvate treated cells antioxidant glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine restores cell growth reverses increase senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. Similarly, demonstrate increasing mitochondrial number via retroviral-mediated expression mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PGC-1 also reduction cell growth rapid induction senescence. results suggest mitochondria appear play central role regulating cellular life span.
