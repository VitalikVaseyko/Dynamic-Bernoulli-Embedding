 recent progress metabolic systems engineering reviewed, particular focusing metabolic flux analysis (MFA) based isotopomer distribution obtained using NMR and/or GC-MS. brief explanation estimate metabolic flux distribution (MFD) based 13C-labeling experiments, metabolic regulation analysis made based protein expression patterns obtained two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) together enzyme activity data, gene expression patterns obtained RT-PCR analysis. particular application considered Escherichia coli. effect culture conditions different carbon sources (glucose, gluconate, glycerol, acetate, etc.) different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, etc. metabolism investigated. effect single-gene knockout pgi-, pyk-, gnd- also investigated. found quite useful integrate information obtained metabolic flux analysis, gene protein expressions well intracellular metabolite concentrations understand overall picture metabolic regulation.
