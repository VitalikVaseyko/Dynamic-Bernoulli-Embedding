 elucidate molecular properties equine glycolytic enzymes equine M(1) (eM(1)) M(2) (eM(2))-pyruvate kinase (PK), mRNAs isolated thoroughbred horse skeletal muscle hair roots, respectively. full-length eM(1) eM(2)-PK cDNAs consist 2,320 2,376 bp, respectively, containing 1596 bp open reading frame. cDNAs mapped equine chromosome 1, equine pyruvate kinase (PKM) gene consists twelve exons. Exon 9 eM(1)-PK exon 10 eM(2)-PK investigated five equine species. 55 amino acids encoded exon 9 equines, Glu 418 Lys 422, conserved PK isozymes among vertebrates, substituted Gln 418 422. Also, transcriptional regulatory element(s), potential involvement alternative splicing exons, completely conserved among equines. semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, strong expression eM(1) eM(2)-PK mRNAs found skeletal muscle, heart, brain thoroughbred horses. addition, authors made novel finding eM(2)-PK derived hair roots transcriptional start site different tissues specific expression. results suggest eM(1) eM(2)-PKs may kinetic properties transcriptional regulatory mechanisms different mammals.
