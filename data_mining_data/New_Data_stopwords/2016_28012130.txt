 Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate result high concentrations reactive aldehydes, oxidative stress, insufficient degradation glycated proteins. AGEs therefore accepted biomarkers aging, diabetes, several degenerative diseases. Due Warburg effect increased oxidative stress, cancer cells frequently accumulate significant amounts AGEs. accumulation AGEs may reflect metabolic state receptor signaling, evaluated potential prognostic predictive value biomarker. used immunohistochemistry determine AGE Nepsilon-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) 213 mammary carcinoma samples Western blotting detect AGEs cell cultures. Whereas significant correlation hormone receptor status CML observed cell lines, CML accumulation tumors positively correlated presence estrogen receptor alpha, postmenopausal state, age. negative correlation found grade III carcinomas triple-negative cases. retrospective Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, statistical trend high CML accumulation correlated favorable prognosis (relapse-free survival, RFS) tamoxifen treatment (p = 0.1). estrogen receptor-negative cases, high CML content significantly correlated unfavorable outcome (RFS) chemotherapy (p = 0.046). CML therefore potentially predictive marker treatment breast cancer patients tamoxifen chemotherapy.
