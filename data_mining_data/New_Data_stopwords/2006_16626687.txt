 Suramin drug choice treatment African trypanosomiasis onchocerciasis. also tested potential use anticancer agent chemosensitizer. suramin reported induce hyperglycaemia, effect glucose formation studied isolated rabbit hepatocytes kidney-cortex tubules. contrast hepatocytes, kidney-cortex tubules suramin augments glucose production decreases lactate formation. Suramin-induced changes intracellular gluconeogenic/glycolytic intermediates indicate decrease flux pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate step. Moreover, compound diminishes pyruvate kinase activity kidney-cortex cytosolic fraction, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate ameliorates inhibitory action. (i) kidneys important contributors whole body glucose homeostasis (ii) suramin known accumulate kidney, suramin-induced stimulation glucose formation renal tubules might responsible hyperglycaemia observed patients undergoing suramin treatment.
