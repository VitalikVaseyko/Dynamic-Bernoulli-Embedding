 Parasitic nematodes ruminants expected experience temperatures excess 40 degrees C faeces pasture and, perhaps, host. L3 Ostertagia (Teladorsagia) circumcincta survived least 90 min 45 degrees C vitro water, larvae inactivated rapidly slightly higher temperatures. glycolytic enzymes hexokinase pyruvate kinase inactivated similar temperature range, whereas malate dehydrogenase maintained activity temperatures excess 50 degrees C. data imply loss glycolytic activity might explain loss larval motility temperatures 45 degrees C 50 degrees C.
