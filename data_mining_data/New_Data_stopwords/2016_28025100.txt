 Though significant progress made availability diagnostic techniques treatment strategies, pancreatic cancer remains disease high mortality rates. Therefore, urgent need better understanding molecular mechanisms governs oncogenesis metastasis process pancreatic cancer. study, using Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset analysis, demonstrated small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) serves biomarker predicting prognosis pancreatic cancer. vitro studies demonstrated silencing ARF6 expression reduced cell proliferation attenuated Warburg effect. Moreover, observed ARF6 downstream target Kras/ERK signaling pathway, strong correlation expression Kras ARF6 TCGA dataset confirmed observation. Taken together, novel findings suggest ARF6, target mutant Kras, may promote pancreatic cancer development enhancing Warburg effect.
