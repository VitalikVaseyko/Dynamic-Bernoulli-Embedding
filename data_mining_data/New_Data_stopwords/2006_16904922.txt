 Glucose metabolism plays essential role physiology development almost living organisms. present study investigated glucose metabolism embryogenesis hard tick Boophilus microplus. increase glucose glycogen content embryonic development B. microplus detected shown due high enzyme activity gluconeogenesis glycolytic pathways. Glucose 6-phosphate (G-6P), formed hexokinase, driven mainly pentose-phosphate pathway, producing fundamental substrates cellular biosynthesis. detected increase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities embryo cellularization. Accumulation key metabolites glycogen glucose monitored revealed glycogen content decreases day 1 day 6, early events embryogenesis take place, increases formation embryo cellular blastoderm day 6. Glucose guanine (a sub-product amino acids degradation arachnids) accumulate almost concomitantly. activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase increased embryo cellularization. Taken together data indicate glycogen glucose, formed B. microplus embryogenesis blastoderm formation, produced intense gluconeogenesis.
