 HIF-1 transcription factor drives hypoxic gene expression changes thought adaptive cells exposed reduced-oxygen environment. example, HIF-1 induces expression glycolytic genes. presumed increased glycolysis necessary produce energy low oxygen support oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria. However, find HIF-1 stimulates glycolysis, also actively represses mitochondrial function oxygen consumption inducing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 phosphorylates inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase using pyruvate fuel mitochondrial TCA cycle. causes drop mitochondrial oxygen consumption results relative increase intracellular oxygen tension. show genetic means HIF-1-dependent block oxygen utilization results increased oxygen availability, decreased cell death total oxygen limiting, reduced cell death response hypoxic cytotoxin tirapazamine.
