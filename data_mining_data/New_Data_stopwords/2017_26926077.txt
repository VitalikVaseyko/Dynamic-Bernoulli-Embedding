 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), predominantly expressed cancers, plays key role Warburg effect. However, PKM2 functions tumor supportive protein fully elucidated. Here, identified tristetraprolin (TTP), AU-rich, element-binding protein regulates mRNA stability, new binding partner PKM2. data reveal PKM2 suppresses TTP protein levels promoting phosphorylation, ubiquitination, proteasome degradation, reducing mRNA turnover ability ultimately impairing cell viability breast cancer cells. p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway might involved PKM2-mediated TTP degradation, treatment p38 inhibitor siRNA abolished PKM2-induced TTP protein degradation. findings demonstrate PKM2-TTP association crucial regulating breast cancer cell proliferation therefore potential therapeutic target cancer.
