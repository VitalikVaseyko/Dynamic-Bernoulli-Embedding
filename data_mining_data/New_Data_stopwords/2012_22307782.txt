 objective determine possible links expression levels genes involved alternative glycolytic pathways, phosphorus (P) scavenging recycling Citrus tolerance aluminum (Al) and/or P-deficiency. 'Xuegan' (Citrus sinensis) 'Sour pummelo' (Citrus grandis) seedlings irrigated 18 weeks nutrient solution containing 0 1.2 mM AlCl(3).6H(2)O x 0, 50 200 muM KH(2)PO(4). C. sinensis displayed tolerant Al P-deficiency C. grandis. Al stress, C. sinensis accumulated Al roots less Al shoots C. grandis. P concentration higher C. sinensis shoots roots C. grandis ones. C. sinensis roots secreted malate citrate C. grandis ones exposed Al. Al-induced-secretion malate citrate excised roots Al-treated seedlings decreased increasing P supply. Al-induced-secretion malate citrate roots Al precipitation P roots might responsible Al-tolerance C. sinensis. qRT-PCR analysis showed Al-activated malate transporter (ALMT1), ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK), pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK), tonoplast adenosine-triphosphatase subunit (V-ATPase A), tonoplast pyrophosphatase (V-PPiase), pyruvate kinase (PK), acid phosphatase (APase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), malic enzyme (ME) malate dehydrogenase (MDH) genes might contribute tolerance Citrus Al and/or P-deficiency, single gene could explain differences two species. Citrus tolerance Al and/or P-deficiency might caused coordinated regulation gene expression involved alternative glycolytic pathways, P scavenging recycling.
