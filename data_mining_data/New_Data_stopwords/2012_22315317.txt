 High-fat feeding inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)-controlled carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation, contributes muscle insulin resistance. aimed reveal molecular changes underpinning process resting exercising humans. also tested whether pharmacological activation PDC overrides diet-induced changes. Healthy males consumed control diet (CD) two occasions isocaloric high-fat diet (HFD). diet, subjects cycled 60 min intravenous infusion saline (CD HFD) dichloroacetate (HFD+DCA). Quadriceps muscle biopsies obtained 10 60 min exercise used estimate CHO use, PDC activation, mRNAs associated insulin, fat, CHO signaling. Compared CD, HFD increased resting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2), PDK4, forkhead box class transcription factor 1 (FOXO1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor transcription factor alpha (PPARalpha) mRNA reduced PDC activation. Exercise increased PDC activation whole-body CHO use HFD, lower extent CD. Meanwhile PDK4 FOXO1, PPARalpha PDK2, mRNA remained elevated. HFD+DCA activated PDC throughout restored whole-body CHO use exercise. FOXO1 appears play role HFD-mediated muscle PDK4 upregulation inhibition PDC CHO oxidation humans. Also, pharmacological activation PDC restores HFD-mediated inhibition CHO oxidation exercise.
