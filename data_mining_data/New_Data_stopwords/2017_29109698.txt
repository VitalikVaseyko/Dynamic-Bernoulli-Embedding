 Warburg effect (WE), aerobic glycolysis, commonly recognized hallmark cancer extensively studied potential anti-cancer therapeutics development. Beyond cancer, plays important role many cell types involved immunity, angiogenesis, pluripotency, infection pathogens (e.g., malaria). Here, review non-cancerous context "hallmark rapid proliferation." observe operates rapidly dividing cells normal pathological states triggered internal external cues. Aerobic glycolysis also preferred metabolic program cases robust transient responses needed. aim draw attention potential computational modeling approaches systematic characterization common metabolic features beyond across physiological pathological conditions. Identification metabolic commonalities across various diseases may lead successful repurposing drugs biomarkers.
