 BACK GROUND: Diabetes mutifactorial disease leads several complications. Currently available drug regimens management diabetes certain drawbacks. Need safer effective medicines natural sources potent antidiabetic activity. Averrhoa bilimbi Linn. (Oxalidaceae) medicinal plant reported possess hypoglycemic activity. OBJECTIVE: investigate antidiabetic potential Averrhoa bilimbi fruit extract streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. METHODS: Diabetes induced male Sprague Dawley rats single intraperitoneal injection streptozotocin (STZ) (40mg/kg body weight). diabetic rats treated orally ethyl acetate fraction A. bilimbi fruits (ABE) (25mg/kg body weight) metformin (100mg/kg body weight) intragastric intubation 60days. 60days, rats sacrificed; blood, liver pancreas collected. Several indices blood glucose, plasma insulin, toxicity markers activities carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes assayed. phytochemicals present ABE identified gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: ABE significantly (p<0.05) reduced level blood glucose hepatic toxicity markers increased plasma insulin diabetic rats. ABE modulated activities carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, significantly increased activities hexokinase (59%) pyruvate kinase (68%) reduced activities glucose-6-phosphatase (32%) fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (20%). histological studies pancreas also supported findings. results compared metformin, standard oral hypoglycemic drug. GC-MS analysis ABE revealed presence 11 chemical constituents extract. CONCLUSIONS: ABE exerts antidiabetic effect promoting glucose metabolism via glycolysis inhibiting hepatic endogenous glucose production via gluconeogenesis.
