 study yellow perch (Perca flavescens) examines series enzymatic markers relative weights pyloric caeca visceral lipids, response changes feeding regime potential use infer recent changes growth rate fish condition. Fish exposed four different feeding regimes 12 weeks resulting specific growth rates ranging 0.3% 3.5% (%/day). Growth condition responded rapidly changes ration weight pyloric caeca visceral lipids reflected increased feed intake. Growth rate correlated muscle citrate synthase caecal nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activities, whereas condition correlated muscle citrate synthase lactate dehydrogenase activities caecal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Results showed enzyme activities biometric parameters responded rapidly increased feed intake, response slower food intake decreased. Plateaus attained condition visceral lipid index, relative weight pyloric caeca continued increase throughout experimental period. Results study could, principle, used infer recent growth energy status wild yellow perch thus provide indicator food availability environment.
