 Homocystinuria neurometabolic disease caused severe deficiency cystathionine beta-synthase activity, resulting severe hyperhomocysteinemia. Affected patients present several symptoms including variable degree motor dysfunction. study, investigated effect chronic hyperhomocysteinemia cell viability mitochondrion, well parameters energy metabolism, glucose oxidation activities pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, respiratory chain complexes creatine kinase gastrocnemius rat skeletal muscle. also evaluated effect creatine biochemical alterations elicited hyperhomocysteinemia. Wistar rats received daily subcutaneous injections homocysteine (0.3-0.6 micromol/g body weight) and/or creatine (50 mg/kg body weight) 6th 28th days age. animals decapitated 12 h last injection. Homocysteine decreased cell viability mitochondrion activities pyruvate kinase creatine kinase. Succinate dehydrogenase increased evaluated parameters changed amino acid. Creatine, combined homocysteine, prevented caused synergistic effect changes provoked amino acid. Creatine per se creatine plus homocysteine altered glucose oxidation. findings provide insights mechanisms homocysteine exerts effects skeletal muscle function, studies needed elucidate them. Although creatine prevents alterations caused homocysteine, used caution, mainly healthy individuals could change homeostasis normal physiological functions.
