 BACKGROUND: Cancerous cells usually exhibit increased aerobic glycolysis, compared normal tissue (the Warburg effect), making pathway attractive therapeutic target. METHODS: Cell viability, cell number, clonogenic assay, reactive oxygen (ROS), ATP, apoptosis assayed MCF-7 tumour cells corresponding primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). RESULTS: Combining glycolysis inhibitors 2-deoxyglucose (2DG; 180 mM) lonidamine (300 muM) 10 J cm(-2) 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) photodynamic therapy (PDT) increases MCF-7 cytotoxicity (by 3.5-fold 70% death 24 h, 10-fold 9-day clonogenic assays). However, glycolysis inhibition slightly increases HMEC PDT cytotoxicity (between two-fold three-fold maximum 9% death 24 h). potentiation PDT cytotoxicity occurred glycolysis inhibitors added ALA incubation, inhibited intracellular accumulation photosensitiser coincubated ALA. CONCLUSION: 2DG lonidamine already used cancer chemotherapeutic agents, results directly translatable combination therapies existing topical PDT.
