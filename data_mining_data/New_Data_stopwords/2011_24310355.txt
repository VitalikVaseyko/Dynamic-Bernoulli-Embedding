 cancer cells shift metabolic pathway metabolism reflecting Pasteur-effect one reflecting Warburg-effect. shift creates acidic microenvironment around tumor becomes driving force positive carcinogenesis feedback loop. consequence tumor acidity, tumor microenvironment encourages selection certain cell phenotypes able survive caustic environment detriment cell types. selection described process modeled upon spite: tumor cells reduce fitness making acidic environment, reduces fitness competitors even greater extent. Moreover, environment important dimension drives spite process. Thus, diminishing selective environment probably interferes spite process. interference recently utilized cancer treatment.
