 Previous reports rabbit adipose tissue synthesize fatty acids significant rates led us study detail pathways lipogenesis glyceroneogenesis tissue. found rabbit adipose tissue low capacity denovo fatty acid synthesis glucose high capacity synthesis pyruvate acetate. tissue also convert pyruvate glyceride-glycerol via dicarboxylic acid shuttle gluconeogenic pathways. Experiments hydroxycitrate, potent inhibitor citrate cleavage enzyme, demonstrated obligatory enzyme lipogenesis pyruvate. lipogenic system rabbit adipose tissue resembles ruminant adapted utilize acetate rather glucose. However, contrast ruminant tissues, limited ability convert glucose fatty acid results deficiency enzymes concerned transport acetyl units mitochondria block prior level pyruvate, likely hexokinase pyruvate kinase reactions.
