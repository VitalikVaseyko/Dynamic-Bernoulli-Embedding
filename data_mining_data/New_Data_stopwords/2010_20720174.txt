 aim study test whether transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma coactivator (PGC)1alpha regulates content pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E1alpha influences PDH activity regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) expression subsequently PDH phosphorylation. PGC-1alpha whole body knockout (KO), muscle-specific PGC-1alpha overexpressing mice (MCK PGC-1alpha), littermate wild-type (WT) mice underwent two interventions known affect PDH. Quadriceps muscles removed fed 24-h fasted mice well 6 h recovery 1-h running mice run acutely. PDH-E1alpha protein content PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation lower PGC-1alpha KO higher MCK PGC-1alpha mice rest, but, MCK PGC-1alpha higher PDK4 protein content, KO PGC-1alpha effect PDK4 protein content. differences phosphorylation partly vanished expressing phosphorylation relative PDH-E1alpha content maintained elevated phosphorylation MCK PGC-1alpha mice. Fasting upregulated PDK4 protein PGC-1alpha KO, MCK PGC-1alpha WT mice, consistently associated increased PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation. Downregulation activity PDH active form (PDHa) 6-h recovery exercise PGC-1alpha KO MCK PGC-1alpha mice association PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation PDHa activity PGC-1alpha KO mice indicate PGC-1alpha required responses. conclusion, PGC-1alpha regulates PDH-E1alpha protein content parallel mitochondrial oxidative proteins, seem influence PDH regulation mouse skeletal muscle response fasting recovery exercise.
