 Cell proliferation known accompanied activation glycolysis. recently discovered glycolysis-promoting enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, isoform 3 (PFKFB3), degraded E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C-Cdh1, also degrades cell-cycle proteins. show two different cell types (neoplastic nonneoplastic) proliferation aerobic glycolysis prevented overexpression Cdh1 enhanced silencing. Furthermore, coexpressed Cdh1 PFKFB3--either wild-type mutant form resistant ubiquitylation APC/C-Cdh1--or glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase demonstrated whereas glycolysis essential cell proliferation, initiation presence active Cdh1 result proliferation. experiments indicate proliferative response, regardless whether occurs normal neoplastic cells, dependent decrease activity APC/C-Cdh1, activates proliferation glycolysis. observations implications cell proliferation, neoplastic transformation, prevention treatment cancer.
