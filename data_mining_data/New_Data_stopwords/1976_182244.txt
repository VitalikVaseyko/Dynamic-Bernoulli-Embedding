 1. regulation glycolysis pyruvate oxidation varying conditions ATP oxygen consumption studied isolated perfused rat hearts. Potassium-induced arrest employed inhibit ATP consumption heart. 2. experimental conditions, beating heart used solely glucose oxidisable substrate. glycolytic flux aldolase step decreased pace decreasing oxygen consumption potassium-induced arrest heart. decrease glucose oxidation larger inhibition oxygen consumption, suggesting arrested heart switches fatty acid oxidation. time course percentage changes inhibition pyruvate oxidation decrease amount active form pyruvate dehydrogenase suggest amount active pyruvate dehydrogenase main regulator pyruvate oxidation perfused heart. 3. test relative significance possible mechanisms regulating covalent interconversions pyruvate dehydrogenase, following parameters measured response potassium-induced cardiac arrest: concentrations pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, CoA-SH, citrate, alpha-oxoglutarate, ATP, ADP, AMP, creatine, creatine phosphate inorganic phosphate mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio. cardiac tissue adenylate system good indicator energy state mitochondrion, even concentrations AMP free cytosolic ADP calculated adenylate kinase creatine kinase equilibria. creatine phosphate inorganic phosphate undergo significant changes, evidence participation latter compounds regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase interconversions lacking. potassium-induced arrest heart resulted decrease pyruvate, slight increase acetyl-CoA, large increase concentration citrate increase mitochondrial NADH/NAD+. results interpreted showing heart, pyruvate dehydrogenase interconversions mainly regulated pyruvate concentration mitochondrial redox state. Concentrations regulators tested shifted directions one would expect result decrease amount active pyruvate dehydrogenase, changes quite small. Therefore, energy-linked regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase intact tissue possibly mediated equilibrium relations cellular redox state phosphorylation potential recently confirmed cardiac tissue.
