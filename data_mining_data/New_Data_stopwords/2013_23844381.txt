 Biological systems hierarchically self-organized complex structures characterized nonlinear interactions. Biochemical energy transformed work physical forces required various biological functions. postulate energy transduction depends endogenous electrodynamic fields generated microtubules. Microtubules mitochondria colocalize cells microtubules providing tracks mitochondrial movement. Besides energy transformation, mitochondria form spatially distributed proton charge layer resultant strong static electric field, causes water ordering surrounding cytosol. effects create conditions generation coherent electrodynamic field. metabolic energy transduction pathways strongly affected cancers. Mitochondrial dysfunction cancer cells (Warburg effect) fibroblasts associated cancer cells (reverse Warburg effect) results decreased increased power generated electromagnetic field, respectively, shifted rebuilt frequency spectra. Disturbed electrodynamic interaction forces cancer healthy cells may favor local invasion metastasis. therapeutic strategy targeting dysfunctional mitochondria restoration physiological functions makes possible switch natural apoptotic pathway blocked cancer transformed cells. Experience dichloroacetate cancer treatment reestablishment healthy state may help development novel effective drugs aimed mitochondrial function.
