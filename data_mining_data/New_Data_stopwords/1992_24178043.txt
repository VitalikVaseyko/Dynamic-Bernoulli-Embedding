 Polyclonal antibodies castor-oil seed cytosolic leucoplastic pyruvate kinases (PKc PKp, respectively; EC 2.7.1.40) utilized examine subunit compositions developmental profiles canola (Brassica napus L. cv. Topas) PKc PKp 6 seed germination 35 culture microspore-derived embryos. PKc germinating seeds appears composed single type 56-kDa subunit, whereas enzyme cultured embryos contains equal proportions immunologically related 57- 56-kDa subunits. PKp immunologically undetectable germinating seeds, enzyme cultured embryos consisted immunologically related 64- 58-kDa subunits ratio 1ratio2, respectively. large increase PK activity occurs second fourth days seed gemination based upon de-novo synthesis PKc. 7 14 culture microspore-derived embryos, levels PKp PK maximal activity increased approx. 3- 2.5-fold, respectively. increases coincident approximately fourfold rise in-vivo pyruvate: phosphoenolpyruvate concentration ratio. Conversely, PKc far less abundant relative PKp, level remained constant 35 microspore-embryo culture.
