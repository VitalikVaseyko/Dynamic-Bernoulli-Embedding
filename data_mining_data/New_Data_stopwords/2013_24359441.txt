 Differences energy metabolism tumor cells normal cells offer attractive avenue research drug targets tumor therapy. use metabolic modulator (sodium dichloroacetate, DCA), administered situ, reverse "Warburg effect" tumor cells demonstrated effective tumor therapy. Herein, DCA diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA) incorporated separately polylactide (PLA) electrospun mats applied C26 tumor-bearing mice via situ administration. 12 treatment, tumor suppression rates 75% 84% achieved DC group (treated DCA-loaded mat) DA group (treated DADA-loaded mat), respectively. tolerable physiologic toxicity high local concentration, DA group showed 95% tumor suppression rate without recurrence 15 therapy. desirable therapeutic effects metabolic modulators ascribe energy-central metabolism-targeting effects DCA DADA, demonstrated vitro vivo. Therefore, DCA- DADA-loaded mats effective anti-cancer drugs dosages discriminate tumor cells normal cells minimizing systemic toxicity.
