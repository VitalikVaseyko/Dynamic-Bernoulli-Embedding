 Kinetic structural properties muscle pyruvate kinases species adapted different temperatures hydrostatic pressures examined. muscle pyruvate kinases exist two temperature-dependent conformational states. low temperature conformers, activation free energies enthalpies proportional species' adaptation temperatures. interspecific differences activation parameters may due different amounts weak bond formation/rupture rate-limiting event(s) catalysis. comparisons substrate binding ability physiological temperatures made, marked conservation apparent Km values observed among species, Structural rigidity, estimated heat inactivation temperature, positively correlated adaptation temperature. apparent size conformational change occurs catalysis also positively correlated cell temperature, except enzymes deep-sea species.
