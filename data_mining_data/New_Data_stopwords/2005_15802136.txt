 Carboxypeptidase U (CPU, TAFIa) novel determinant fibrinolytic rate. circulates blood inactive zymogen, procarboxypeptidase U, activated process coagulation fibrinolysis. CPU short half-life 37 degrees C. intrinsic instability complicates determination kinetic parameters different substrates using endpoint method. developed fast kinetic assay measuring continuously release C-terminal arginine CPU independent nature substrate peptide used, allowing us perform substrate specificity studies CPU. method uses arginine kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase auxiliary enzymes. CPU activities measured using kinetic assay range 97-103% determined HPLC-assisted reference assay, obtained K(m) k(cat) values hippuryl-l-arginine bradykinin good accordance described literature. expected, arginine cleaving seen using dipeptides peptide substrates proline penultimate position. presented kinetic assay enables fast screening substrates C-terminal arginine valuable new tool kinetic evaluation synthetic physiological substrates CPU.
