 Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) catalyzes last step glycolysis plays important role tumor cell proliferation. Recent studies reported PKM2 also regulates apoptosis. However, mechanisms underlying role PKM2 remain elusive. show PKM2 translocates mitochondria oxidative stress. mitochondria, PKM2 interacts phosphorylates Bcl2 threonine (T) 69. phosphorylation prevents binding Cul3-based E3 ligase Bcl2 subsequent degradation Bcl2. chaperone protein, HSP90alpha1, required function PKM2. HSP90alpha1's ATPase activity launches conformational change PKM2 facilitates interaction PKM2 Bcl2. Replacement wild-type Bcl2 phosphorylation-deficient Bcl2 T69A mutant sensitizes glioma cells oxidative stress-induced apoptosis impairs brain tumor formation orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, peptide composed amino acid residues 389 405 PKM2, PKM2 binds Bcl2, disrupts PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, promotes Bcl2 degradation impairs brain tumor growth. addition, levels Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation, conformation-altered PKM2 Bcl2 protein correlate one another specimens human glioblastoma patients. Moreover, levels Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation conformation-altered PKM2 correlate grades prognosis glioma malignancy. findings uncover novel mechanism mitochondrial PKM2 phosphorylates Bcl2 inhibits apoptosis directly, highlight essential role PKM2 ROS adaptation cancer cells, implicate HSP90-PKM2-Bcl2 axis potential target therapeutic intervention glioblastoma.
