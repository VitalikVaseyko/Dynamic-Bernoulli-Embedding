 PDK1 master kinase activates least six protein kinase groups including AKT, PKC S6K potential target treatment range malignancies. show overexpression PDK1 40% myelomonocytic acute leukemia patients. Overexpression PDK1 occurred uniformly throughout leukemic population, including putative leukemia-initiating cells. Clinical outcome analysis revealed PDK1 overexpression associated poorer treatment outcome. Primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts over-expressing PDK1 showed improved vitro survival ectopic expression PDK1 promoted survival myeloid cell lines. Analysis PDK1 target kinases revealed PDK1 overexpression closely associated increased phosphorylation PKC isoenzymes inhibition PKC strongly inhibited survival advantage PDK1 over-expressing cells. Membrane localization studies implicated PKCalpha major target PDK1 disease. PDK1 over-expressing blasts showed differential sensitivity PDK1 inhibition (in low micromolar range) suggesting oncogene addiction, whilst normal bone marrow progenitors refractory PDK1 inhibition effective inhibitor concentrations. PDK1 inhibition also targeted subpopulations leukemic blasts putative leukemia-initiating cell phenotype. Together data show overexpression PDK1 common acute myelomonocytic leukemia associated poorer treatment outcome, probably arising cytoprotective function PDK1. also show therapeutic targeting PDK1 potential effective selective treatment patients, also compatible current treatment regimes.
