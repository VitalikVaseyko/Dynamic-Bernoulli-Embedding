 electrophoretically detectable variant pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) found house mouse Mus musculus. variant seen tissues examined except liver red cells. gene (Pk-3) determining electrophoretic variation inherited autosomal codominant located chromosome 9. data confirm genetic determination pyruvate kinase liver red cells separate tissues. addition, results indicate muscle (M1) kidney (M2) pyruvate kinase isozymes share least one genetic determinant may fact determined structural gene.
