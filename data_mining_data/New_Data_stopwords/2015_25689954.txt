 Cancer cells shown altered metabolism compared normal non-malignant cells. Warburg effect describes phenomenon cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose glycolysis, producing lactate end product, despite presence oxygen. phenomenon first described Otto Warburg 1920s, resurfaced controversial theory, supportive opposing arguments. biochemical aspects Warburg effect outline strong explanation cause cancer cell proliferation, providing biological requirements cell grow. Studies shown pathways phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) well hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) central regulators glycolysis, cancer metabolism cancer cell proliferation. Studies shown PI3K signaling pathways role many cellular processes metabolism, inflammation, cell survival, motility cancer progression. Herein, cellular aspects PI3K pathway described, well influence HIF cancer cell metabolism. HIF-1 activation related angiogenesis, erythropoiesis modulation key enzymes involved aerobic glycolysis, thereby modulating key processes required Warburg effect. review discuss molecular aspects Warburg effect particular emphasis role HIF-1 PI3K pathway.
