 fast reliable two-step method established chemical synthesis 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate, 6-thioguanosine 5'-diphosphate 6-thioguanosine 5'-triphosphate starting ribonucleoside. first step, 6-thioguanosine dissolved triethyl phosphate, high yield reacts phosphorus oxide trichloride 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate purified anion-exchange chromatography DEAE-Sephadex using step gradient hydrochloric acid. second step, 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate dissolved water, reacts phosphoric acid presence pyridine/dicyclohexyl carbodiimide converted 6-thioguanosine 5'-diphosphate 6-thioguanosine 5'-triphosphate separated 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate anion-exchange chromatography DEAE-Sephadex using gradient ammonium bicarbonate. Material step preparation procedure separated reversed-phase HPLC chromatography analyzed free ribonucleoside content, 5'-monophosphate, 5'-diphosphate, 5'-triphosphate small amounts unidentified phosphorylated compounds. purity final preparations identity 6-thioguanosine 5'-phosphate proven highly specific enzymatic peak-shifting/HPLC analyses using alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, pyruvate kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase combined hexokinase/glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
