 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease major public health concern obese type 2 diabetic populations. high-fat lard diet induces obesity fatty liver C57BL/6J mice suppresses expression PPAR-target gene, FA elongase 5 (Elovl5). Elovl5 plays key role MUFA PUFA synthesis. Increasing hepatic Elovl5 activity obese mice lowered hepatic TGs endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (X-box binding protein 1 cAMP-dependent transcription factor 6alpha) increased TG catabolism fatty acyl carnitines. Increased hepatic Elovl5 activity increase hepatic capacity beta-oxidation. Elovl5 effects hepatic TG catabolism linked increased protein levels adipocyte TG lipase (ATGL) comparative gene identification 58 (CGI58). Elevated hepatic Elovl5 activity also induced expression (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 fibroblast growth factor 21), cytochrome P450 4A10 (CYP4A10), PPAR-target genes. FA products Elovl5 activity increased ATGL, CGI58, mRNA PPARbeta-dependent mechanisms human HepG2 cells. Treatment mouse AML12 hepatocytes PPARbeta agonist (GW0742) decreased (14)C-18:2,n-6 TGs affect beta-oxidation. studies establish Elovl5 activity regulates hepatic levels FAs controlling PPARbeta activity, ATGL expression, TG catabolism, FA oxidation.
