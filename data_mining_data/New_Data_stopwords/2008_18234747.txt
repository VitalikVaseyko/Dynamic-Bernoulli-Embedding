 combined genetic selection dietary treatment produce model study metabolic pathways involved genetic nutritional control fat deposition fish muscle. Two experimental lines rainbow trout, selected lean (L) fat (F) muscle, fed diets containing either 10 23% lipids first feeding, 6 mo. end feeding trial, trout distinguished different muscle fat content (from 4.2 10% wet weight), line x diet interactions observed parameters related fat storage. analyzed activity gene expression key enzymes involved lipid metabolism (fatty acid synthase, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 isoforms, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) glycolysis (hexokinase 1 pyruvate kinase) well energy production (isocitrate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, cytochrome oxidase) liver white muscle rainbow trout. lipid-rich diet repressed activity lipogenic enzymes stimulated enzymes involved fatty acid oxidation glycolysis liver little effect muscle enzymes assessed study. Regarding selection effect, enzyme activity expression suggest compared L line, F line presented reduced hepatic fatty acid oxidation well reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacities enhanced glucose utilization liver muscle. line x diet interactions found, suggesting two factors (i.e., dietary energy content selection) used study modify muscle lipid content exerted additive mostly independent effects metabolic actors.
