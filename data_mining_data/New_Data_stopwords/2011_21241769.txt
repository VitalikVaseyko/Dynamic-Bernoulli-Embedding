 Ghrelin, hormone whose levels increase food deprivation, plays pivotal role regulation food intake, energy metabolism storage, well insulin sensitivity. Here, investigated effects acyl-ghrelin neutralization acyl-ghrelin-binding compound NOX-B11(2) fasting-refeeding cycle. data demonstrate ghrelin neutralization NOX-B11(2) impairs recuperation lost body weight food deprivation. Analysis enzymes involved glucose lipid metabolism liver fed, fasted refed rats revealed neutralization acyl-ghrelin resulted minor decreases enzymes glycolytic lipogenic pathways fasting. However, refeeding enzymes well glycogen levels recovered slowly acyl-ghrelin blocked. high levels ghrelin response food deprivation may contribute adequate decrease hepatic glycolytic lipogenic enzymes aid recovery body weight energetic reserves food becomes available fasting period.
