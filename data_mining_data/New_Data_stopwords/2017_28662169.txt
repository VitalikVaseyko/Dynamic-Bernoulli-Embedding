 study evaluated effects Inonotus obliquus polysaccharides (IOs) diabetes underlying mechanisms related inflammatory factors oxidative stress mouse model streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Four weeks administration metformin (120 mg/kg) IO1-4 (50%-80% alcohol precipitation), IO5 (total 80% alcohol precipitation) doses 50 mg/kg reverses abnormal changes bodyweights fasting blood glucose levels diabetic mice. IOs significantly increased insulin pyruvate kinase levels serum, improved synthesis glycogen, especially IO5. IOs restored disturbed serum levels superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde. down-regulation interleukin-2 receptor, matrix metalloproteinase-9, enhancement interleukin-2 serum diabetic mice significantly attenuated IOs. Histologic morphology examinations showed IOs repaired damage kidney tissues, inhibited inflammatory infiltrate extracellular matrix deposit injuries diabetic mice. Compared untreated diabetic mice, IOs decreased expression phosphor-NF-kappaB kidneys. results show IOs treatment attenuated diabetic renal injure STZ-induced diabetic mice, possibly modulation oxidative stress inflammatory factors. results provide valuable evidences support use I. obliquus hypoglycemic functional food and/or medicine.
