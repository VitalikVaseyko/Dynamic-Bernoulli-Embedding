 Regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex demonstrated key mechanism control carbohydrate oxidation conservation glucose carbon. effect sterile inflammation chronic sepsis (small large abscess) activity PDH complex examined liver skeletal muscle. Sepsis altered proportion PDH active, dephosphorylated form. hepatic tissue, sterile inflammation leads 2.5-fold increase proportion active PDH complex compared fed control. increase proportion active PDH complex observed rats small septic abscess. However, severity septic episode increased, proportion active PDH complex decreased relative sterile inflammation small septic abscess animals. different pattern response sterile inflammation sepsis proportion active PDH complex observed skeletal muscle compared liver. contrast liver, sterile inflammation alter proportion active PDH skeletal muscle. addition, sepsis (either small large septic abscess) resulted 3-fold decrease proportion active PDH relative fed control sterile inflammatory animals. decrease proportion active PDH complex sepsis associated corresponding increase skeletal muscle acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio. mechanism responsible lowered PDH complex activity may due increased PDH kinase activity, secondary increased skeletal muscle acetyl-CoA/CoA ratios.
