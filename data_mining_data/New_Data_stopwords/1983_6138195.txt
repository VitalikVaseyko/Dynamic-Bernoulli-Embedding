 comparative study glycolytic enzymes chicken erythrocytes somatic tissues carried out, results shown active units per mg protein supernatants 1085, 12,100 106,000 g fractionated centrifugation. profiles glycolytic enzymes analyzed terms activity relative hexokinase ratios pairs enzymes bearing product-substrate relationship. Chicken erythrocyte displays peculiar profile glycolytic enzymes. possesses FruP2-activated pyruvate kinase L isoenzyme type, seem predominant isoenzyme together type, content glycolytic enzymes much lower somatic tissues.
