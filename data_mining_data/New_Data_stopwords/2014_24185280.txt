 Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) syndrome severe bone marrow failure high mortality. previous studies demonstrated immature activated DC1 increased bone marrow SAA patients, balance DC1 subsets shifted stable form active one, might promote Th0 cells polarize Th1 cells cause over-function lymphocytes hematopoiesis failure SAA. assumed myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) may key immune cells cause destruction hematopoietic cells SAA, mechanism activation mDCs unclear. Here, investigated proteome mDCs SAA patients explore pathogenesis SAA possible antigen leads immune activation SAA. mDCs 12 SAA patients, 12 remission patients 12 controls sorted flow cytometry examined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry. Intensity changes 41 spots detected statistical significance. Nine 41 spots identified MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. Changes protein expression levels found SAA group. changes reveal abnormal expression cofilin, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase enzyme M2 mDCs SAA patients may reason mDC hyperfunction.
