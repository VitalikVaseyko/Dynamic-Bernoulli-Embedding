 physiology two metabolites vitamin understood substantial detail: retinaldehyde functions universal chromophore vertebrate invertebrate eye; retinoic acid regulates set vertebrate transcription factors, retinoic acid receptor superfamily. third member retinoid triumvirate retinol. functioning precursor retinaldehyde retinoic acid, growing body evidence suggests far fundamental role retinol signal transduction. show retinol essential metabolic fitness mitochondria. cells deprived retinol, respiration ATP synthesis defaulted basal levels. recovered significantly higher energy output soon retinol restored physiological concentration, without need metabolic conversion retinoids. Retinol emerged essential cofactor protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), without enzyme failed activated mitochondria. Furthermore, retinol needed physically bind PKCdelta, mutation retinol binding site rendered PKCdelta unresponsive Rol, retaining responsiveness phorbol ester. PKCdelta/retinol complex signaled pyruvate dehydrogenase complex enhanced flux pyruvate Krebs cycle. baseline response reduced vitamin A-deficient lecithin:retinol acyl transferase-knockout mice, corrected within 3 h intraperitoneal injection vitamin A; suggests vitamin physiologically important. results illuminate hitherto unsuspected role vitamin mitochondrial bioenergetics mammals, acting nutritional sensor. such, retinol fundamental importance energy homeostasis. data provide mechanistic explanation nearly 100-yr-old question vitamin deficiency causes many pathologies independent retinoic acid action.
