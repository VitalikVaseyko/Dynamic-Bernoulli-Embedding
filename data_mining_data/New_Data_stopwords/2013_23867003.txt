 BACKGROUND: N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC), natural sulfur-containing amino acid derivative, peroxisome proliferators activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligand shown anticancer properties. However, mechanisms agents inhibit human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell growth well elucidated. METHODS: Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) used knockdown 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), PPARalpha, p65 p53 genes; Western Blot performed detect protein expression PDK1, PPARalpha, p65 p53; Cell viability MTT assays carried determine cell proliferation; Transient transfection Dual-Luciferase Reporter assays used transfect siRNAs exogenous expression vectors, measure gene promoter activity. RESULTS: showed NAC inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation reduction PDK1 expression. NAC also induced protein expression PPARalpha. PPARalpha ligand enhanced, PPARalpha antagonist siRNA abrogated effect NAC PDK1 promoter activity, protein expression cell growth. Overexpression PDK1 diminished inhibitory effect NAC cell proliferation. NAC induced p53 reduced p65 protein expression activation PPARalpha. Silencing p53 overexpression p65 blocked effect NAC PDK1 promoter activity protein expression. CONCLUSION: results show NAC inhibits PDK1 expression PPARalpha-mediated induction p53 inhibition p65 protein expression. PPARalpha ligand enhances effect NAC. ultimately inhibits NSCLC cell growth. study unveils novel mechanism NAC combination PPARalpha ligand inhibits growth human lung carcinoma cells.
