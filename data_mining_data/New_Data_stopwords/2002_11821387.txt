 precise metabolic steps couple glucose catabolism insulin secretion pancreatic beta cell incompletely understood. ATP generated glycolytic metabolism cytosol, mitochondrial metabolism, and/or hydrogen shuttles operating cytosolic mitochondrial compartments implicated important coupling factor. identify importance metabolic pathways, compared fates four fuel secretagogues (glucose, pyruvate, dihydroxyacetone, glycerol) INS1-E beta cell line. Two fuels, dihydroxyacetone glycerol, normally ineffective secretagogues enabled adenovirus-mediated expression glycerol kinase. Comparison two particular fuels allows effect redox state insulin secretion evaluated since phosphorylated products dihydroxyacetone phosphate glycerol phosphate lie opposite sides NADH-consuming glycerophosphate dehydrogenase reaction. Based upon measurements glycolytic metabolites, mitochondrial oxidation, mitochondrial matrix calcium, mitochondrial membrane potential, find insulin secretion tightly correlates mitochondrial metabolism four fuels. case glucose stimulation, high control strength glucose phosphorylation sets pace glucose metabolism thus rate insulin secretion. However, bypassing reaction pyruvate, dihydroxyacetone, glycerol uncovers constraints imposed mitochondrial metabolism, attains similar maximal limit insulin secretion. specifically, found hyperpolarization mitochondrial membrane, related proton export mitochondrial matrix, correlates well insulin secretion. Based findings, propose fuel-stimulated secretion fact limited inherent thermodynamic constraints proton gradient formation.
