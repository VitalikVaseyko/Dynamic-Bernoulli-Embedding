 BACKGROUND: Chlorella vulgaris (ChV), unicellular green algae reported anticancer antioxidant effects. aim study determine chemopreventive effect ChV liver cancer induced rats determining level expression several liver tumour markers. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) divided 4 groups according diet given: control group (normal diet), ChV group three different doses (50, 150 300 mg/kg body weight), liver cancer- induced group (choline deficient diet + 0.1% ethionine drinking water CDE group), treatment group (CDE group treated three different doses ChV). Rats killed 0, 4, 8 12 weeks experiment blood tissue samples taken groups determination tumour markers expression alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) specific antigen oval cells (OV-6). RESULTS: Serum level TGF-beta increased significantly (p < 0.05) CDE rats. However, ChV doses managed decrease (p < 0.05) levels control values. Expressions liver tumour markers AFP, TGF-beta, M2-PK OV-6 significantly higher (p < 0.05) tissues CDE rats compared control showing increased number cancer cells hepatocarcinogenesis. ChV doses reduced expressions significantly (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Chlorella vulgaris chemopreventive effect downregulating expression tumour markers M2-PK, OV-6, AFP TGF-beta, HCC-induced rats.
