 study 2 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-specific inhibitors, wortmannin 2-[4-Morpholinyl]-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), used investigate whether PI 3-kinase involved signal transduction leads bovine oocyte maturation. Bovine follicular oocytes cultured vitro 24 h basic medium consisting tissue culture medium-199 supplemented LH, FSH, fetal cow serum, Na-pyruvate gentamicin. oocytes examined stage meiotic progression degree cumulus expansion. Experiment 1, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs), wortmannin, level tested (10(-8) M, 10(-7) 10(-6) M), effect resumption meiosis judged germinal vesicle breakdown progression prometaphase metaphase I. However, wortmannin significantly (P < 0.01) decreased proportion oocytes developing metaphase II dose-dependent manner. Experiment 2, denuded oocytes cultured wortmannin 0, 10(-7) 10(-6) concentrations, pattern response COCs observed, effect meiotic resumption significant (P < 0.01) decrease proportion oocytes reaching metaphase II. Experiment 3, half recovered COCs denuded denuded intact COCs cultured presence 0, 2.5 x 10(-5) M, 5.0 x 10(-5) 7.5 x 10(-5) LY 294002 examined meiotic progression. Whereas LY294002, examined level, effect percentage oocytes developing metaphase I, significantly (P < 0.01) decreased proportion metaphase II oocytes used 5.0 x 10(-5) 7.5 x 10(-5) intact COCs denuded oocytes. Experiment 4, significant difference degree cumulus expansion scored COCs cultured presence wortmannin LY294002 absence either treatment. results provide indirect evidence role PI 3-kinase bovine oocyte regulating meiotic progression beyond metaphase I.
