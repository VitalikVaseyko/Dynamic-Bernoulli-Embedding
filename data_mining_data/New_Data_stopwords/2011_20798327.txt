 Restriction phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) supply plastids causes lethality female male gametophytes Arabidopsis thaliana defective phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator (PPT) inner envelope membrane plastid-localized enolase (ENO1) involved glycolytic PEP provision. Homozygous double mutants cue1 (defective PPT1) eno1 could obtained, homozygous cue1 heterozygous eno1 mutants [cue1/eno1(+/-)] exhibited retarded vegetative growth, disturbed flower development, 80% seed abortion. phenotypes diminished oil seeds, reduced flavonoids aromatic amino acids flowers, compromised lignin biosynthesis stems, aberrant exine formation pollen indicate cue1/eno1(+/-) disrupts multiple pathways. diminished fatty acid biosynthesis PEP via plastidial pyruvate kinase appears affect seed abortion, restriction shikimate pathway affects formation sporopollonin tapetum lignin stem. Vegetative parts cue1/eno1(+/-) contained increased free amino acids jasmonic acid normal wax biosynthesis. ENO1 overexpression cue1 rescued leaf root phenotypes, restored photosynthetic capacity, improved seed yield oil contents. chloroplasts, ENO1 might enzyme missing complete plastidic glycolysis.
