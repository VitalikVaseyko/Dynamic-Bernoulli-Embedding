 Activation glycolytic genes HIF-1 considered critical metabolic adaptation hypoxia increased conversion glucose pyruvate subsequently lactate. found HIF-1 also actively suppresses metabolism tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) directly trans-activating gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 inactivates TCA cycle enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), converts pyruvate acetyl-CoA. Forced PDK1 expression hypoxic HIF-1alpha null cells increases ATP levels, attenuates hypoxic ROS generation, rescues cells hypoxia-induced apoptosis. studies reveal hypoxia-induced metabolic switch shunts glucose metabolites mitochondria glycolysis maintain ATP production prevent toxic ROS production.
