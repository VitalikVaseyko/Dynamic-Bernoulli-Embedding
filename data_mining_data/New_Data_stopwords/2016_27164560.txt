 Metabolic reprogramming aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect well recognized common feature tumorigenesis. However, molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic alterations tumor therapeutic resistance poorly understood. gene expression profiling analysis found histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1 expression highly elevated tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines clinical tumors. IHC analysis indicated NSD2 protein overexpression associated disease recurrence poor survival. Ectopic expression NSD2 wild type, methylase-defective mutant, drove endocrine resistance multiple cell models xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, NSD2 recruited methylated H3K36me2 promoters key glucose metabolic enzyme genes. overexpression coordinately up-regulated hexokinase 2 (HK2) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), two key enzymes glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), well TP53-induced glycolysis regulatory phosphatase TIGAR. Consequently, NSD2-driven tamoxifen-resistant cells tumors displayed heightened PPP activity, elevated NADPH production, reduced ROS level, without significantly altered glycolysis. results illustrate coordinated, epigenetic activation key glucose metabolic enzymes therapeutic resistance nominate methyltransferase NSD2 potential therapeutic target endocrine resistant breast cancer.
