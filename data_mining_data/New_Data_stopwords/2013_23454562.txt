 spleen functions filter circulating blood, removing aging abnormal red blood cells, intraerythrocyte inclusions well foreign particals. spleen composed lymphocytic tissue, circulatory elements mononuclear phagocytic cells plays important role nonspecific well specific immune response. Additionally, spleen serves reservoir circulating blood cells, especially platelet sequestration spleen well cumented. spleen produces blood cells fetal development certain haematological disorders myelofibrosis. destruction red blood cells within splenic cords releases iron circulation, recycled used manufacture new erythrocytes bone marrow. several non-malignant haematological disorders antibody-coated cells cleared circulation phagocytic cells spleen. involves erythrocytes autoimmunhaemolytic anaemias, platelets immunthrombocytopenia neutrophils Felty syndrome. hereditary spherocytosis spleen destroys resulting defective, spherical red cells. pyruvate kinase deficiency impaired production adenosine triphosphate leads destruction red blood cells spleen liver. sickle cell anaemia defective erythrocytes cause sludging thrombosis small vessels infarcts instance spleen, time result autosplenectomy. thalassaemia major abnormal haemoglobin forms protein precipitates red cells development severe hypochromic anaemia haemolysis intramedullary inef fective erythropoiesis. Therapeutic splenectomy option mentioned non-malignant haematological disorders. rationale pathophysiology role thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura probably least well understood. use new effective drugs monoclonal antibody rituximab thrombopoietin agonists immunthrombocytopenia well option laparoscopic rather open splenectomy changed view benefits risks splenectomy recent years. minimize risks overwhelming postsplenectomy infection abdominal vein thrombosis, prophylactic vaccination, postoperative thromboembolism prophylaxis patient education mandatory.
