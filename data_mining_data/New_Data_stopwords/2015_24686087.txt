 Understanding mechanisms colorectal cancer (CRC) metastatic progression essential reducing morbidity mortality. Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyses final step glycolysis identified critical regulator glucose consumption. However, mechanisms roles PKM1 PKM2 regulation CRC cell migration cell adhesion remain elusive. Here, report PKM2 rather PKM1 drives CRC cell migration cell adhesion, whereas PKM attenuation reverses phenomena. Furthermore, overexpression PKM2 significantly increases expression N-cadherin, MMP-2, MMP-9, STAT3, Snail-2, pFAK active beta1-integrin, E-cadherin expression suppressed. importantly, results indicated PKM2 overexpression facilitates STAT3 nuclear translocation, required PKM2 function regulation migration adhesion associated signalling. addition, dimeric form PKM2, lacks pyruvate kinase activities possesses protein kinase activity, critical CRC cell migration cell adhesion. Overall, study suggests PKM2 overexpression promotes CRC cell migration cell adhesion regulating STAT3-associated signalling PKM2 may serve therapeutic target CRC metastasis.
