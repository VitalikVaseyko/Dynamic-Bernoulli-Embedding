 UNLABELLED: Lung cancer (LC) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly coexist smokers, presence COPD increases risk developing LC. aim study identify distinct proteomic profiles able discriminate two pathological entities. Protein content assessed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 60 patients classified four groups: COPD, COPD LC, LC without COPD, control neither COPD LC. Proteins separated spots bidimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) examined matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF). total 40 proteins differentially expressed LC and/or COPD groups compared control group. Distinct protein profiles identified validated pathological entity (LC COPD). main networks involved related inflammatory signalling, free radical scavenging oxidative stress response, glycolysis gluconeogenesis pathways. relevant signalling link LC COPD NF-kappaB pathway. conclusion, protein profiles identified contribute elucidate underlying pathogenic pathways diseases, provide new tools potential use biomarkers early diagnosis LC. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Sequence coverage. protein sequence coverage (95%) estimated specific proteins percentage matching amino acids identified peptides confidence greater equal 95% divided total number amino acids sequence. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Mapping proteins onto biological pathways disease networks demonstrated 22 proteins linked inflammatory signalling (p-value: 1.35 10(-08)-1.42 10(-02)), 15 proteins associated free radical scavenging oxidative stress response (p-value: 4.93 10(-11)-1.27 10(-02)), 9 proteins related glycolysis gluconeogenesis pathways (p-value: 7.39 10(-09)-1.58 10(-02)).
