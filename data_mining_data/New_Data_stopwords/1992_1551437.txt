 investigate existence dynamic adenine nucleotide (AdN) compartment mitochondrial intermembrane space, used reconstituted systems consisting (i) functional intact liver heart mitochondria (ii) pyruvate kinase plus phosphoenolpyruvate, competing ADP either formed intermembrane space adenylate kinase added directly into, regenerated ATPase within, extramitochondrial space. shown ADP formation mitochondrial intermembrane space prerequisite dominating oxidative phosphorylation reconstituted systems, suggesting dynamic ADP compartmentation space.
