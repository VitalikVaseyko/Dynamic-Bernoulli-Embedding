 aim study investigate possible role tubulin betaII, cytoskeletal protein, regulation mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation energy fluxes heart cells. isotype tubulin closely associated mitochondria co-expressed mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK). rapidly removed mild proteolytic treatment permeabilized cardiomyocytes absence stimulatory effect cytochrome c, demonstrating intactness outer mitochondrial membrane. Contrary isolated mitochondria, permeabilized cardiomyocytes (in situ mitochondria) addition pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) presence creatine effect rate respiration controlled activated MtCK, showing limited permeability voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) ADP regenerated MtCK. normal conditions, effect considered one sensitive tests intactness cardiomyocytes controlled permeability MOM adenine nucleotides. However, proteolytic treatment permeabilized cardiomyocytes trypsin, removing mitochondrial betaII tubulin, induces high sensitivity MtCK-regulated respiration PK-PEP, significantly changes kinetics affinity exogenous ADP. MtCK coupled ATP synthasome VDAC controlled tubulin betaII provides functional compartmentation ATP mitochondria energy channeling cytoplasm via phosphotransfer network. Therefore, direct transfer mitochondrially produced ATP sites utilization largely avoided physiological conditions, may occur pathology mitochondria damaged. article part Special Issue entitled ''Local Signaling Myocytes''.
