 flux glycolysis tightly controlled feed-back feed-forward allosteric regulations maintain body's glucose homeostasis respond cell's growth energetic needs. Using mathematical model based reported mechanisms allosteric regulations enzymes, demonstrate glycolysis exhibits multiple steady state behavior segregating glucose metabolism high flux low flux states. Two regulatory loops centering phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase gives rise bistable behavior, together impose complex flux control. Steady state multiplicity endows glycolysis robust switch transit two flux states. physiological glucose concentrations glycolysis flux move states easily without external stimulus hormonal, signaling oncogenic cues. Distinct combination isozymes glycolysis gives different cell types versatility response different biosynthetic energetic needs. Insights switch behavior glycolysis may reveal new means metabolic intervention treatment cancer metabolic disorders suppression glycolysis.
