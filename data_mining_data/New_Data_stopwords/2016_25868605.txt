 Cancer cells exhibit altered metabolism characterized preference aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial oxidation pyruvate. provides anabolic support selective growth advantage cancer cells. Recently, new concept arisen suggesting metabolic changes may due, part, attenuated mitochondrial function results inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). mitochondrial complex links glycolysis Krebs cycle current understanding regulation involves cyclic phosphorylation dephosphorylation specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDPs).
