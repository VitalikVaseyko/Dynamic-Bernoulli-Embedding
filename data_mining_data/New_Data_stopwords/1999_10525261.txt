 toxicity tributyltin chloride (TBT) involves Ca(2+) overload, cytoskeletal damage, mitochondrial failure leading cell death apoptosis necrosis. Here, examined whether intracellular ATP level modulates mode cell death exposure TBT. Jurkat cells energized mitochondrial substrate, pyruvate, low concentrations TBT (1-2 microM) triggered immediate depletion intracellular ATP followed necrotic death. ATP levels maintained addition glucose, mode cell death typically apoptotic. Glycolytic ATP production required apoptosis two distinct steps. First, maintenance adequate ATP levels accelerated decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, release intermembrane proteins adenylate kinase cytochrome c mitochondria. possible role adenine nucleotide exchanger first ATP-dependent step suggested experiments performed specific inhibitor, bongkrekic acid. substance delayed cytochrome c release manner similar caused ATP depletion. Second, caspase activation following cytochrome c release observed ATP-containing cells. Bcl-2 minor effect TBT-triggered caspase activation cell death. conclude intracellular ATP concentrations control mode cell death TBT-treated Jurkat cells mitochondrial caspase activation levels.
