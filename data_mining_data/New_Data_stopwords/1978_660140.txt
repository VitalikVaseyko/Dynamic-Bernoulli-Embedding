 purpose study examine pyruvate kinase isozymic patterns wide variety tissues rats mice, particularly regarding hybrid isozymes. studies, employed longer electrophoresis times used earlier studies order improve resolution closely spaced bands. tissue distributions types K, L, pyruvate kinases found approximately reported earlier rats mammals. addition, K-M hybrids could detected tissues examined relative quantities differed one tissue another organism, corresponding tissues different species, within single tissue development. Hybrid isozymes containing type L subunits occur tissues either fetus adult either animal. earlier studies utilizing L-M hybrid isozymes produced vitro, showed kinetic properties given subunit profoundly affected nature neighbors within tetramer (Dyson Cardenas, ['73] J. Biol. Chem., 248: 8482-8488). Based altered kinetic properties, suggest little need anorganism suppress completely gene activity one subunit type pyruvate kinase synthesis larger quantities second subunit type.
