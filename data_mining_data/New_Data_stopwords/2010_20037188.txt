 diabetes mellitus, endogenous hepatic glucose production increased result impaired activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism, leads condition known hyperglycemia. D-pinitol, bioactive constituent isolated soybeans, shown reduce hyperglycemia experimental diabetes. therefore designed study investigate effect oral administration D-pinitol (50 mg/kg b. w. 30 days) activities key enzymes carbohydrate glycogen metabolism liver tissues streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. efficacy compared glyclazide, standard hypoglycemic drug. Oral administration D-pinitol diabetic group rats showed marked decrease levels blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin increase plasma insulin body weight. activities hepatic enzymes hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase hepatic glycogen content significantly (p < 0.05) increased whereas activities glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase glycogen phosphorylase significantly (p < 0.05) decreased diabetic rats treated D-pinitol. results suggest alterations activities key metabolic enzymes carbohydrate metabolism could one biochemical rationale D-pinitol attenuates hyperglycemic effect diabetic rats.
