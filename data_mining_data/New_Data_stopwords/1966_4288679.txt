 Increasing concentrations sodium octanoate progressively inhibitory activities glucokinase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase. Glucose-6-phosphate 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases also markedly inhibited. enzymes carbohydrate metabolism lactate dehydrogenase, phosphohexose isomerase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase decreased. Among key glycolytic enzymes, inhibition pyruvate kinase fatty acid marked. biological significance inhibition key glycolytic enzymes interpreted feedback inhibitory mechanism regulation fatty acid biosynthesis. mechanism may function rapid adaptation organism use fatty acid level metabolic directional switch decreasing glycolysis turning gluconeogenesis.
