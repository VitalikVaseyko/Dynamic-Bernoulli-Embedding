 Skeletal muscle possesses high degree plasticity adapt physical metabolic challenges faces. acute bout exercise sufficient induce expression variety metabolic genes, GLUT4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK-4), uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1). Reducing muscle glycogen levels exercise potentiates effect exercise many genes. Similarly, altered substrate availability induces transcription many genes. purpose study determine whether glucose ingestion attenuates exercise-induced increase variety exercise-responsive genes. Six male subjects (28 +/- 7 yr; 83 +/- 3 kg; peak pulmonary oxygen uptake = 46 +/- 6 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)) performed 60 min cycling 74 +/- 2% peak pulmonary oxygen uptake two separate occasions. one occasion, subjects ingested 6% carbohydrate drink. occasion, subjects ingested equal volume sweet placebo. Muscle samples obtained vastus lateralis rest, immediately exercise, 3 h exercise. PDK-4, UCP3, PGC-1, GLUT4 mRNA levels measured samples using real-time RT-PCR. Glucose ingestion attenuated (P < 0.05) exercise-induced increase PDK-4 UCP3 mRNA. similar trend (P = 0.09) observed GLUT4 mRNA. contrast, PGC-1 mRNA increased following exercise extent conditions. data suggest glucose availability modulate effect exercise metabolic gene expression.
