 reticulocyte supernatant, cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate concentrations 10(-3) 10(-2)M causes stimulation aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases some, e.g., valine leucine, all, amino acids; highest nonsaturating concentrations ATP. Similar concentrations cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate found stimulate phenylalanine polymerization phenylalanyl transfer ribonucleic acid polyuridylic acid-charged reticulocyte ribosomes. degree stimulation highest low GTP concentrations. abolished addition phosphoenolpyruvate + pyruvate kinase, stimulate similarly effectively low GTP levels. conditions experiments, cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate appreciably inhibit GTP hydrolysis.
