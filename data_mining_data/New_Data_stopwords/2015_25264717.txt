 Obesity leading preventable comorbidity associated increased prostate cancer-related recurrence mortality. Epidemiological clinical studies indicate body mass index >30 associated increased oxidative DNA damage within prostate gland increased prostate cancer-related mortality. provide evidence obesity promotes worse clinical outcome induction metabolic abnormalities known promote genotoxic stress. previously reported blood serum derived obese mice may enhance proliferative invasive potential human prostate cancer cell lines ex vivo. show 1-h exposure LNCaP PacMetUT1 prostate cancer cell lines nonmalignant RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells 2% serum obese mice induces markers aerobic glycolysis relative exposed serum nonobese mice. metabolic change correlated accumulation reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased frequency DNA double-strand breaks. Interestingly, N-tert-Butylhydroxylamine, antioxidant, significantly suppressed markers aerobic glycolysis cells exposed blood serum obese mice, suggesting ROS contributes metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis. describe obesity-induced changes key metabolic markers impact prostate cancer cell progression explore role antioxidants ameliorating effects.
