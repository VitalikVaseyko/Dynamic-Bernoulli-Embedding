 influence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate Ca2+ kinetics pyruvate kinase Escherichia coli K12 studied (at pH 7.0 25 degrees C) using pH-stat method measurement reaction progress well initial-rate analysis. data analysed basis concerted model three conformational states [Markus, Plesser, Boiteux, Hess & Malcovati (1980) Biochem. J. 189, 421-433] using novel procedure computer-directed treatment progress curves [Markus & Plesser (1976) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 4, 361-364]. addition fructose 1,6-bisphosphate sigmoid kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate Mg2+ abolished activity enzyme described classical saturation kinetics. explained exclusive binding fructose 1,6-bisphosphate allosteric site conformational state forms active complex. observe Ca2+ activator enzyme low Mg2+ Ca2+ concentrations; otherwise inhibitor. effects understood assuming Ca2+ binding properties Mg2+, although allow catalytic turnover.
