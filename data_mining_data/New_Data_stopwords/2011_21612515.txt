 Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) involved age-related diseases, including complications diabetes chronic renal impairment arterial stiffening. Alagebrium chloride (ALT-711) AGE-lowering agent beneficial effects renal structural functional parameters diabetes, decreased diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, age-related myocardial stiffening. ALT-711 exhibits structural homology thiamine, suggested interfere thiamine metabolism. Thiamine converted thiamine diphosphate (TDP) thiamine diphosphokinase (TDPK). TDP cofactor pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase transketolase. decreased activity enzymes due TDP deficiency results disorders beriberi Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Therefore, investigated whether ALT-711 inhibitor TDPK. Molecular modeling studies showed ALT-711 fits thiamine-binding pocket TDPK, three interactions thiazolium ring enzyme, well parallel stacking phenyl ring indole ring Trp222B. Enzyme kinetic experiments also showed ALT-711 dose-dependently decreased TDPK activity K(i)s, calculated different experiments fitting models ranging 0.88 1.09 mM. Fitting kinetic data favored mixed-mode inhibition major role competitive inhibition. summary, results suggest ALT-711 low-affinity inhibitor TDPK, unlikely interfere thiamine metabolism therapeutic concentrations. However, new AGE-crosslink breakers based thiamine designed, care taken act potent competitive inhibitors ALT-711.
