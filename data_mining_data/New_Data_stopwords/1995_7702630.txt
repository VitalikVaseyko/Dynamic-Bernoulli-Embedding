 Novel erythrocyte pyruvate kinase gene defects found patient without family history consanguinity. polymerase chain reaction products R-type pyruvate kinase cDNA propositus contained two point mutations Ser80 (TCC)-->Pro (CCC) Arg490 (CGG)-->Trp (TGG). Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction genomic DNA revealed patient compound heterozygote. mobilities patient's L- R-type pyruvate kinase thin-layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis abnormal. results consistent fact mutations within exons common hepatic erythrocyte isozymes.
