 ontogenetic study pyruvate kinase brain liver tissues performed different batches rats, foetus 13th day gestation adult subject. -- According kinetic study, shape curve transformed sigmoid hyperbolic 13th day foetal life adulthood brain. Hill coefficient increases age animal liver tissue. -- According polyacrylamide gel isoelectrofocusing, family four, transitory definite bands detected foetal brain : well defined pHi : M4, M3, M2, M1 ; adult stage, M1 predominates, M2 minor. Threee principal bands distinguished liver : two characteristic foetal life (Lf M2), one adulthood (L). -- According immunochemical tests, antigenic determinants common M1, M2, M3 M4. confrontation first two methods prompts conclusion kinetic enzyme (and perhaps function) varies animals age linked molecular structure. third method, allows stress precociousness appearance common antigenic determinants, simultaneously immature enzymatic forms. signification kinetic modifications well succession isozymes type determined order discussed vivo formation hydbrids suggested.
