 Insulin resistance, impaired action insulin, linked many important consequences, including Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, acanthosis nigricans polycystic ovarian syndrome. Although genetic causes insulin resistance, common cause excess nutrition condition called "Nutrient Toxicity". excess glucose excess fat cause insulin resistance muscle fat tissues excess fat cause insulin resistance liver. High fat feeding fat infusion rapidly lead development insulin resistance caused impairment glucose transport. studies shown defects insulin signaling possibly secondary activation Protein Kinase C resulting accumulation active fatty acyl CoA's. Glucose toxicity studied vivo vitro. vivo shown rats over-expressing gluconeogenic enzyme Phosphoenol Pyruvate Carboxykinase (PEPCK) develop insulin resistance fat muscle tissues features metabolic syndrome including mild obesity dyslipidemia. Excess glucose entry fat cells results increased flux hexosamine biosynthesis pathway leading activation protein kinase C impairment glucose transport. Obesity resulting excess nutrient intake also cause insulin resistance increase production agents impair insulin action TNFalpha resistin decrease production insulin sensitizing compound adiponectin. glucose free fatty acids acutely stimulate insulin secretion chronic exposure high levels either nutrient leads impairment beta cell function. combination insulin resistance beta cell failure leads diabetes. Nutrient toxicity thus driving cause diabetes epidemic recorded around world.
