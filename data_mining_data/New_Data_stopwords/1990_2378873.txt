 second-order rate constants reaction Mg2+ complexes phosphorylated pyridine monoanions Mg(OH)+ 10(4)-10(6)-fold larger second-order rate constants reaction water (25 degrees C, ionic strength 1.5). 10(6)-fold rate enhancement phosphorylated 4-morpholinopyridine/Mg2 complex, approximately 10(4)-fold attributed greater nucleophilicity Mg(OH)+ compared water. remaining catalysis approximately 10(2)-fold attributed induced intramolecularity positioning hydroxide ion phosphoryl group Mg2+ ions. reaction may provide model role metal ion increasing concentration anions enolpyruvate serine holding nucleophile correct position phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed pyruvate kinase alkaline phosphatase, example. mechanisms provide catalysis phosphoryl transfer metaphosphate-like transition state reviewed briefly.
