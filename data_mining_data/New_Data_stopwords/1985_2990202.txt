 Since discovery glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) pyruvate kinase deficiencies, erythroenzymopathies associated hereditary hemolytic anemia extensively investigated. Kinetic electrophoretic studies shown most, all, erythroenzymopathies caused production mutant enzyme. Except enzymes abundant blood tissues, difficult obtain enough sample study functional structural abnormalities mutant enzymes associated genetic disorders man. primary structures two normal red cell enzymes cause hereditary hemolytic anemia, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) adenylate kinase, determined. Single amino acid substitutions PGK variants found, identification exact molecular abnormalities variants helped us understand accompanying functional abnormality. Gene cloning makes possible identification DNA sequence codes enzyme proteins. Recently, human complementary DNA (cDNA) aldolase, PGK, G6PD, adenosine deaminase (ADA) isolated, nucleotide sequences PGK ADA determined. near future, human cDNA sequencing permit identification gene alteration gives rise mutant enzymes.
