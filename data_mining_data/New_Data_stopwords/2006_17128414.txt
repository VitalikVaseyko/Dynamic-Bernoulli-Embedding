 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial role physiological signal transduction also pathogenesis several human diseases atherosclerosis, neuro-degenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, aging cancer amongst others. Oxidative stress also responsible cellular organism senescence, accordance Harman initially proposed free radical theory aging. Recent findings support notion protection oxidative stress increase life span significantly. reported enhanced glycolysis could modulate cellular life span reduction oxidative stress. Moreover, tumor suppressor gene p53 controls post-transcriptionally level glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). enhanced glycolysis distinctive prominent feature cancer cells (termed Warburg effect), findings disclosed novel aspect Warburg effect: connection senescence oxidative stress.
