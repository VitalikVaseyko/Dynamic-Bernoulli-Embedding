 effects natural aliphatic polyamines basal hormone-stimulated protein phosphorylations hepatocytes studied. Cells isolated adult rats incubated suspension [32P]orthophosphate, absence presence polyamines varying concentrations different times; hepatocytes exposed various hormones 10 min. Phosphoproteins contained total cell lysates analyzed one- two-dimensional gel electrophoresis autoradiography. Spermine, effective amine, decreased basal level phosphorylation proteins 46, 34 22 kDa, increased 18 kDa protein. effects, maximal external concentration 7.5-10 mM, detectable lag period 10 min reached plateau 45 min. Pretreatment cells polyamine almost completely prevented stimulation phosphorylation 46 34 kDa proteins insulin; contrast, effects phenylephrine proteins partly inhibited, whereas glucagon appeared largely unaffected. major polyamine effect observed intact cells (i.e., decreased phosphorylation) could reproduced cell-free system kinase activity persisted. Indeed, spermine added directly cell extracts strongly accelerated dephosphorylation 46 kDa protein also 61 kDa protein identified pyruvate kinase; furthermore, restoration activity enzyme occurred concomitantly dephosphorylation 61 kDa protein presence spermine.
