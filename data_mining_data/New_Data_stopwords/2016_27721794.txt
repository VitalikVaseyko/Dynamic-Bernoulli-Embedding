 Glycolysis provides precursors synthesis macromolecules may contribute ATP supply required constant accelerated cellular duplication cancer cells. consequence, inhibition glycolysis reiteratively considered anti-cancer therapeutic option. previous studies, kinetic modeling glycolysis cancer cells allowed identification main steps control glycolytic flux: glucose transporter, hexokinase (HK), hexose phosphate isomerase (HPI), glycogen degradation human cervix HeLa cancer cells rat AS-30D ascites hepatocarcinoma. also previously experimentally determined simultaneous inhibition non-controlling enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PYK), enolase (ENO) brings significant decrease glycolytic flux cancer cells accumulation intermediate metabolites, mainly fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru1,6BP), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), inhibitors HK HPI, respectively. found kinetic modeling inhibition cancer glycolysis attained blocking downstream non flux-controlling steps long Fru1,6BP DHAP, regulatory metabolites flux-controlling enzymes, accumulated. Furthermore, experimental results modeling showed oxamate iodoacetate inhibitions PYK, ENO, glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), LDH phosphoglycerate kinase, induced accumulation Fru1,6BP DHAP AS-30D hepatoma cells. Indeed, PYK, ENO, GAPDH exerted highest control Fru1,6BP DHAP concentrations. high levels metabolites inhibited HK HPI led glycolytic flux inhibition, ATP diminution, accumulation toxic methylglyoxal. Hence, anticancer effects downstream glycolytic inhibitors likely mediated mechanism. parallel, also found uncompetitive inhibition flux-controlling steps potent mechanism competitive mixed-type inhibition efficiently perturb cancer glycolysis.
