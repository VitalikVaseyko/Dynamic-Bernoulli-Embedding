 assess effects subordinate social status digestive function, metabolism, enzyme activity salmonid fish, juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss paired size-matched conspecifics (<1.5% difference fork length) 5 d. Fish fasted 5 fish sampled directly holding tank used control groups. subordinate fasted fish experienced significant decreases intestine mass (P = 0.043), gall bladder showed marked significant changes size (P = 0.004) appearance. findings suggest negative effect social subordination digestive function reflects large part lack feeding. Hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity significantly higher subordinate fish relative dominants, whereas subordinate hepatic pyruvate kinase activity significantly lower; activities enzymes significantly correlated plasma cortisol concentrations behavior scores. Dominant-subordinate differences activities enzymes eliminated administration glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, underlining role circulating cortisol eliciting differences. Significant increases relative control fish also detected red white muscles subordinate fish activities protein catabolic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase). differences occurred absence change plasma free amino acid ammonia concentrations, supporting enhanced turnover amino acids muscle subordinate fish. results support hypothesis changes metabolism, beyond elicited low food consumption, may responsible least part low growth rates typical subordinate fish changes may related specifically circulating cortisol levels subordinate fish.
