 INTRODUCTION: Enhancement glucose metabolism repression oxidative phosphorylation followed Warburg effect common hallmark cancer cells. Hexokinase II (HKII) plays dual role - first, HKII up-regulation results increased glycolysis rates. Second, association VDAC HKII contributes inhibition apoptosis repression formation mitochondrial permeability transition pores. AREAS COVERED: review, role HKII evasion apoptosis, aspects HKII expression regulation, novel approaches targeting HKII VDAC-HKII complexes application areas discussed. EXPERT OPINION: dual role HKII cancer cells makes attractive target anti-cancer therapy. Several agents, either synthetic plant-derived, target hexokinase induce VDAC-HK complex dissociation identified date. Targeting hexokinase, HK-VDAC complexes well glycolytic proteins improves efficacy commonly used drugs. prominent benefit approach ability overcome drug resistance, example, cisplatin sorafenib. cases, could create insurmountable challenge selection appropriate therapy. Future studies trials address issue transfer approaches clinical practice.
