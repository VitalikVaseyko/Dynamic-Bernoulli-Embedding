 Tumor aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, plays important roles tumor survival, growth, metastasis. Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) key enzyme regulates aerobic glycolysis tumor cells. Recent research shown PKM2 used tumor marker diagnosis and, particular, potential target cancer therapy. investigated effects combining shRNA targeting PKM2 docetaxel human A549 lung carcinoma cells vivo vitro. observed shRNA significantly downregulate expression level PKM2. decrease PKM2 resulted decrease ATP synthesis, caused intracellular accumulation docetaxel. Furthermore, combination pshRNA-pkm2 docetaxel inhibited tumor growth promoted cancer cell apoptosis vivo vitro. findings suggest targeting tumor glycolysis increase efficacy chemotherapy. particular, targeting PKM2 could, extent, new way reversing chemotherapy resistance cancer therapy.
