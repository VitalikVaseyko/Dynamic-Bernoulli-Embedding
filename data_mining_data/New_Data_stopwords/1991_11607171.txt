 Maize leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase [PEPC; orthophosphate:oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase (phosphorylating), EC 4.1.1.31] protein-serine kinase (PEPC-PK) phosphorylates serine-15 target enzyme, thus leading increase catalytic activity concomitant decrease malate sensitivity cytoplasmic C4 photosynthesis enzyme light. recently demonstrated PEPC-PK activity maize leaves slowly, strikingly, increased light decreased darkness. report, provide evidence cycloheximide, inhibitor cytoplasmic protein synthesis, fed detached leaves C4 monocots (maize, sorghum) dicots (Portulaca oleracea) dark light, completely prevents vivo light activation PEPC-PK activity regardless whether protein kinase activity assessed vivo vitro. contrast, chloramphenicol, inhibitor protein synthesis chloroplasts, effect light activation maize PEPC-PK. Similarly, treatment cycloheximide influence light activation photosynthesis-related enzymes maize, including cytoplasmic sucrose-phosphate synthase chloroplast stromal NADPH-malate dehydrogenase pyruvate, Pi dikinase. related results, detached maize leaves treated simultaneously cycloheximide microcystin-LR, potent vivo vitro inhibitor PEPC type 2A protein phosphatase, indicate short-term protein turnover PEPC-PK essential component(s) (e.g., putative protein modifies kinase activity) one primary levels complex unique regulatory cascade effecting reversible light activation/seryl phosphorylation PEPC mesophyll cytoplasm C4 plants.
