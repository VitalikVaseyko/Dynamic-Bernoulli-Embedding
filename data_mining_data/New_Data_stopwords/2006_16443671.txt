 Fatty acids primary fuel heart ligands peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), regulate expression genes encoding proteins involved fatty acid metabolism. Saturated fatty acids, particularly palmitate, converted proapoptotic lipid intermediate ceramide. study assessed cardiac function, expression PPAR-regulated genes, cardiomyocyte apoptosis rats 8 wk either low-fat diet [normal chow control (NC); 10% fat calories] high-fat diets composed mainly either saturated (Sat) unsaturated fatty acids (Unsat) (60% fat calories) (n = 10/group). Sat group lower plasma insulin leptin concentrations compared NC Unsat groups. Cardiac function mass body mass different. Cardiac triglyceride content increased Sat Unsat groups compared NC (P < 0.05); however, ceramide content higher Sat group compared Unsat group (2.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.2 nmol/g; P < 0.05), whereas NC group intermediate (2.3 +/- 0.3 nmol/g). number apoptotic myocytes, assessed terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining, higher Sat group compared Unsat group (0.28 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.04 apoptotic cells/1,000 nuclei; P < 0.04) positively correlated ceramide content (P < 0.02). high-fat diets increased myocardial mRNA expression PPAR-regulated genes encoding uncoupling protein-3 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4, Sat diet upregulated medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. conclusion, dietary fatty acid composition affects cardiac ceramide accumulation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, expression PPAR-regulated genes independent cardiac mass function.
