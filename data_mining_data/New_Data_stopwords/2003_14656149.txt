 better understand intracellular responses hyperosmotic pressure recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (rCHO) cells expressing antibody, taken proteomics approach. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis mass spectrometry, proteome profile rCHO cells comprising 23 identified proteins established. basis proteome profile, found three proteins expression levels significantly changed 450 mOsm/kg. Compared results 300 mOsm/kg, two glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, found up-regulated, probably leading increased metabolic energy antibody synthesis. elevation specific glucose consumption rate 450 mOsm/kg agreed up-regulation glycolytic enzymes. hand, tubulin expression down-regulated, reflecting depressed cell growth rate 450 mOsm/kg. Taken together, study shows potential proteomics approach understanding intracellular physiological changes cells seeking better insight possible environmental genetic manipulation approaches increasing foreign protein production rCHO cells.
