 paper substrate activities binding affinities stereoisomers beta,gamma-bidentate Rh(H2O)4ATP alpha,beta, gamma-tridentate Rh(H2O)3ATP complexes toward selected members kinase family enzymes reported. Hexokinase glycerokinase found specific delta beta, gamma-bidentate Rh(H2O)4ATP isomer substrate adenylate kinase found specifically catalyze reaction delta beta,gamma-bidentate Rh(H2O)4ATP isomer. Pyruvate kinase recognized delta beta,gamma-bidentate Rh(H2O)4ATP isomer delta beta-P, exo alpha-P alpha,beta,gamma-tridentate Rh(H2O)3ATP isomer substrates catalyzed phosphorylation alternate substrate, glycolate. 31P NMR analysis respective product complexes showed alpha-P phosphoryl ligand exchange preceded followed catalysis. Creatine kinase found specific delta beta-P, exo alpha-P alpha,beta,gamma-tridentate Rh(H2O)3ATP isomer. Discrimination Rh(H2O)nATP isomers via preferential binding substrate-active isomer observed hexokinase adenylate kinase glycerokinase, fructose-6 phosphate kinase, creatine kinase, arginine kinase, acetate kinase.
