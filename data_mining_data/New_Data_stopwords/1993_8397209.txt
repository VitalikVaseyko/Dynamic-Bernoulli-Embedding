 Receptors peptide YY (PYY) identified PKSV-PCT renal proximal tubule cell line, derived transgenic mice (SV40 large antigen control rat L-type pyruvate kinase 5'-regulatory sequence). Binding [125I-Tyr36]monoiodo-PYY ([125I] PYY cell specific, saturable, reversible. order potency peptides inhibiting [125I]PYY binding was: PYY > neuropeptide (NPY) = PYY (13-36) >> pancreatic polypeptide. single class receptors observed Kd 0.37 +/- 0.05 nM Bmax 103 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein. cross-linking, electrophoresis covalent [125I]PYY-receptor complexes revealed single band M(r) 50,000. PYY receptors exclusively present basolateral membrane surface polarized cells coupled negatively adenylylcyclase pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. PKSV-PCT cell growth antigen expression could modulated D-glucose medium. PYY receptors exclusively expressed proliferative cells cultured presence D-glucose. PYY receptors disappeared absence D-glucose expressed proliferation activated reintroduction D-glucose. PYY stimulated cell growth (17-26% increase) promoted [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation DNA (64% increase; ED50 = 5 nM PYY) cells grown D-glucose-enriched medium. latter effect PYY largely reversed pretreatment cells pertussis toxin. findings suggest PYY receptors play role epithelial cell growth.
