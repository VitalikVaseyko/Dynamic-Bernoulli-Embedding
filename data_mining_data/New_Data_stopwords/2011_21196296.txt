 shift cellular energy production oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) glycolysis, even aerobic conditions, called Warburg effect. elucidate changes mitochondrial energy metabolism ganglioneuroma (GN) individual OXPHOS enzymes analyzed activity assays immunohistochemical staining methods. GN (n=7) showed significant reduction activity content OXPHOS enzymes. Citrate synthase activity also severely diminished GN compared normal cortical kidney (p=0.0002) adrenal (p=0.0024) tissues. Furthermore, mitochondrial membrane protein porin undetectable significantly reduced. Accordingly, reduction copy number mitochondrial DNA observed GN compared cortical kidney tissue. striking decline mitochondrial mass specific GN neuroblastoma, reduction OXPHOS complexes without reduction mitochondrial mass reported. Knowledge mechanism tumor cells achieve Warburg effect provide starting point functional studies aimed restoring aerobic energy metabolism potential new therapeutic strategy treat malignancies.
