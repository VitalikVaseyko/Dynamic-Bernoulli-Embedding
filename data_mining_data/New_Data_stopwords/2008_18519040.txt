 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication pathogenesis involve virus-encoded proteins cellular factors. study, showed NS5B, HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, interacted M2 type pyruvate kinase (M2PK) L type pyruvate kinase. confirmed interaction GST pull down, coimmunoprecipitation confocal immunofluorescence analysis cells transient expression NS5B M2PK well HCV replicon-bearing cell line. Furthermore shRNA specifically down-regulated M2PK expression could inhibit replication HCV HCV replicon 9B cells.
