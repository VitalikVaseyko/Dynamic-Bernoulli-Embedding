 Here, investigated changes apoptosis tumor progression analyzing effect coexpressing various antiapoptotic genes multistage process c-myc-induced hepatocarcinogenesis transgenic mice. Whereas continuous c-myc gene overexpression liver led cellular hepatocarcinoma, coexpression bcl-2 gene inhibited emergence liver tumors, inhibiting pretumoral phase characterized increased proliferation apoptosis. antioncogenic effect specific Bcl-2 shared antiapoptotic genes bcl-xL dominant negative form p53. Thus, shown Bcl-2 tumor suppressor effect vivo c-myc-induced hepatocarcinogenesis emergence neoplastic foci.
