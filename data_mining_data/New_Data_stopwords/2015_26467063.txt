 BACKGROUND: Cancer metabolism emerging promising research area genitourinary tumors. renal cell carcinoma (RCC) prostate cancer (PCa) cells exhibit marked alterations metabolism. changes include increased aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), increased protein DNA synthesis de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis. OBJECTIVE: Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying alterations represent major step forward cancer research. Indeed, reprogramming cancer cell energy metabolism represents promising hallmark cancer may pave way novel personalized approaches. METHOD: PubMed databases searched articles published cancer metabolism genitourinary tumors. RESULTS CONCLUSION: review focused metabolic alterations occur RCC PCa describes mechanisms underlying metabolic changes.
