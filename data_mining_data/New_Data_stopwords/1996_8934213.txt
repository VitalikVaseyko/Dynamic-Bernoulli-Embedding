 rapid activation glycogen synthase human skeletal muscle recovery isometric contraction dependent intact circulation, suggests requirement activating humoral factor. determine whether activating factor insulin, muscle biopsies obtained subjects rest, fatigue, 3 min postexercise intact circulation, 3 min postexercise circulation muscle occluded. Two inositol phosphoglycan mediators insulin action isolated biopsies, bioactivity measured determining effects isolated mediators activities purified cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase glycogen synthase phosphatase vitro. Bioactivity altered condition compared rest. data suggest changes inositol phosphoglycans responsible circulation-dependent activation glycogen synthase recovery exercise.
