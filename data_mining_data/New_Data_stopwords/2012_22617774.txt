 High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) implicated variety biologically important processes, including transcription, DNA repair, differentiation, development, extracellular signaling. However, potential role HMGB1 tumor biology still remains intractable. previous study showed TLR9 response CpG oligonucleotide (ODN) 95D human lung cancer cells could enhance growth invasive potential vitro vivo. found CpG ODN stimulation 95D cells induced secretion HMGB1 dose dependent manner. showed blockade extracellular HMGB1 using box peptide ethyl pyruvate significantly abrogated CpG ODN enhanced progression 95D cells. Interestingly, found HMGB1 alone acted synergistic CpG ODN could enhance progression 95D cells. Notably, revealed RAGE TLR4 critical HMGB1 exert synergistic function. observed MyD88-dependent upregulation matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP9 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 95D cells response HMGB1. findings might understanding TLR9 signaling tumor biology helpful developing HMGB1-based strategy lung cancer.
