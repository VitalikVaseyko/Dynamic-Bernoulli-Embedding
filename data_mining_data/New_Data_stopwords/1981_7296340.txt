 Purified glycolytic enzymes individually chromatographed columns Sepharose 4B containing covalently bound F-actin-tropomyosin complex. Five enzymes, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase able interact complex. Glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate phosphomutase, enolase bind F-actin-tropomyosin matrix. One nonbinding enzyme, phosphoglycerate phosphomutase, observed interact F-actin-tropomyosin column preloaded lactate dehydrogenase. Since least four glycolytic enzymes associate actin directly, suggested glycolytic enzyme complex exists, nonadsorbing enzymes must interact one enzymes bind actin.
