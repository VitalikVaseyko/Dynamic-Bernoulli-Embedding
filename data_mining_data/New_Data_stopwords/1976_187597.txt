 hormonal control [14C]glucose synthesis [U-14C-A1dihydroxyacetone studied hepatocytes fed starved rats. cells fed rats, glucagon lowered concentration substrate giving half-half-maximal rates incorporation little effect maximal rate. Inhibitors gluconeogenesis pyruvate effect ability hormone stimulate synthesis [14C]glucose dihydroxyacetone. concentrations glucagon epinephrine giving half-maximal stimulation dihydroxacetone 0.3 0.4 mM 0.3 0.5 muM, respectively. meaximal catecholamine stimulation much less maximal stimulation glucagon mediated largely alpha receptor. Insulin effect basal rate [14C]clucose synthesis inhibited effect submaximal concentration glucagon concentration catecholamine. Glucagon effect uptake dihydroxyacetone suppressed conversion lactate pyruvate. suppression accounted increase glucose synthesis. cells gasted rats, lactate production greatly reduced rate glucose synthesis elevated, glucagon stimulate gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone. Findings glycerol substrate similar dihyroxyacetone. Ethanol also stimulated glucose production dihydroxyacetone reducing proportionately production lactate. Ethanol known generate reducing equivalents fro clyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase presumably thereby inhibits carbon flux lactate site. effect additive glucagon. Estimates steady state levels intermediary metabolites flux rates suggested glucagon activated conversion fructose diphosphate fructose 6-phosphate suppressed conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate. direct evidence inhibition pyruvate kinase observation brief exposure cells glucagon caused 70% inhibition enzyme activity homogenates cells. inhibition seen enzyme assayed 20 muM fructose diphosphate. effect glucagon lower fructose diphosphate levels intact cells may promote inhibition pyruvate kinase. inhibition pyruvate kinase may reduce recycling pathway gluconeogenesis major physiological substrates probably accounts fromsome stimulatory effect glucagon.
