 inhibition photosynthesis supplying glucose detached leaves spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) used model system search mechanisms potentially contribute "sink" regulation photosynthesis. Detached leaves supplied 50 mM glucose water 7 transpiration stream, holding leaves low irradiance (16 mumol photons . m(-2) . s(-1)) cycle 9 h light/15 h darkness prevent endogenous accumulation carbohydrate. Leaves supplied water showed marginal changes photosynthesis, respiration, enzyme levels metabolites. leaves supplied 50 mM glucose, photosynthesis gradually inhibited several days. inhibition marked photosynthesis measured saturating irradiance ambient CO2, less marked saturating irradiance saturating CO2, least marked limiting irradiance. gradual loss ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) protein, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase chlorophyll. inhibition photosynthesis accompanied large decrease glycerate-3-phosphate, increase triose-phosphates fructose-1,6-bisphospate, small decrease ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. stromal NADPH/NADP ratio increased (as indicated increased activation NADP-malate dehydrogenase), ATP/ADP ratio increased. Chlorophyll-fluorescence analysis indicated thylakoid energisation increased, acceptor side photosystem II reduced. Similar results obtained glucose supplied floating leaf discs low irradiance glucose solution, detached spinach leaves held high light produce endogenous accumulation carbohydrate. Feeding glucose also led increased rate respiration. accompanied changes pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, pyrophosphate: fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase activity. decrease phosphoenolpyruvate, glycerate-3-phosphate glycerate-2-phosphate, increase pyruvate triose-phosphates, increased ATP/ADP ratio. results show (i) accumulation carbohydrate inhibit photosynthesis via long-term mechanism involving decrease Rubisco Calvin-cycle enzymes (ii) respiration stimulated due unknown mechanism, increases utilisation phosphoenolpyruvate.
