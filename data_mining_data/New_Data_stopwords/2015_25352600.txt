 Glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis sensitive nutritional state, net direction flux controlled multiple enzymatic steps. delicate balance liver disrupted variety pathological states including cancer diabetes mellitus. Hyperpolarized carbon-13 magnetic resonance new metabolic imaging technique probe intermediary metabolism nondestructively. currently methods rapidly distinguish livers gluconeogenic glycogenolytic state. use gluconeogenic precursor dihydroxyacetone (DHA) deliver hyperpolarized carbon-13 perfused mouse liver. DHA enters gluconeogenesis level trioses. Perfusion conditions designed establish either gluconeogenic glycogenolytic state. Unexpectedly, found [2-(13)C]DHA metabolized within seconds common intermediates end products glycolysis gluconeogenesis conditions, including [2,5-(13)C]glucose, [2-(13)C]glycerol 3-phosphate, [2-(13)C]phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), [2-(13)C]pyruvate, [2-(13)C]alanine, [2-(13)C]lactate. [2-(13)C]Phosphoenolpyruvate, key branch point gluconeogenesis glycolysis, monitored functioning tissue first time. Observation [2-(13)C]PEP anticipated free energy difference PEP pyruvate large. Pyruvate kinase regulatory step common glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway appears exert significant control kinetics metabolites DHA. ratio glycolytic gluconeogenic products distinguished gluconeogenic glycogenolytic state functioning livers.
