 PK-LR gene studied 23 patients congenital haemolytic anaemia associated erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Twenty-seven different mutations detected among 42 mutated alleles identified: 19 missense mutations, four splice site mutations one nonsense, one single base deletion two large deletions. Seventeen (107G, 278T, 403T, 409A, 661A, 859C, 958A, 1094T, 1190T, 1209A, 1232C, 1369G, 507A, IVS9 -1c, IVS9 +43c [corrected] del C224, del 5006bp IVS3--> nt 1431) new.
