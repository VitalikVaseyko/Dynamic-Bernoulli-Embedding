 Nineteen enzymes showing highest activity liver examined human rodent tissues cultured cells using starch-gel electrophoresis. rat hepatoma line Faza 967 strongly expressed 13 enzymes. series somatic cell hybrids, constructed Faza cells non-hepatic origin derived man Chinese hamster, examined expression enzymes. human/rat hybrids continued produce rat liver-specific enzymes, human forms enzymes glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase L reexpressed cases.
