 Sub-chronic exposure municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) situ recently shown impact acute response secondary stressor rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). However, little known whether MWWE exposure stressful animal. address this, carried laboratory study examine organismal cellular stress responses tissue-specific metabolic capacity trout exposed MWWE. Juvenile rainbow trout exposed 0, 20 90% MWWE (from tertiary wastewater treatment plant), replenished every 2d, 14 d. Fish sampled 2, 8 14 post-exposure. Plasma cortisol, glucose lactate levels measured indicators organismal stress response, inducible heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), constitutive heat shock protein 70 (hsc70) hsp90 expression liver used markers cellular stress response. Impact MWWE cortisol signaling ascertained determining glucocorticoid receptor protein (GR) expression liver, brain and, heart, metabolic capacity evaluated measuring liver glycogen content tissue-specific activities key enzymes intermediary metabolism. Plasma glucose lactate levels unaffected exposure MWWEs, whereas cortisol showed transient increase 20% group 8d. Liver hsc70 hsp90, hsp70 expression, higher 90% MWWE group 8d. temporal change GR expression liver heart, brain trout exposed MWWE. Liver glycogen content activities liver gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) significantly affected MWWE exposure. glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK) hexokinase (HK) activities significantly higher temporally MWWE exposure gill heart, liver brain. Overall, 14 exposure MWWE evokes cellular stress response perturbs cortisol stress response rainbow trout. tissue-specific temporal changes metabolic capacity suggest enhanced energy demand fish exposed MWWE, may eventually lead reduced fitness.
