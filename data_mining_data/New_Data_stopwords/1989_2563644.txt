 kinetic regulatory properties two pyruvate kinase isozymes, PKp PKc (apparent chloroplastic cytosolic isozymes, respectively) green alga Selenastrum minutum studied. two isozymes differed greatly several kinetic properties. Although isozymes showed hyperbolic substrate saturation kinetics, apparent Michaelis constants PEP ADP twofold fourfold lower, respectively, PKc compared PKp. ADP preferred nucleotide substrate isozymes. However, PKc utilized alternate nucleotides far effectively PKp. PKc PKp also differed strongly effect activators inhibitors enzymes. Although isozymes activated dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) similar activation constant 30 microM, activator (0.5 mM) caused approximate 30% increase Vmax PKc, effect Vmax PKp. PKp, PKc, inhibited ribose 5-phosphate, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, 2-phosphoglycerate, phosphoglycolate, malate. isozymes inhibited MgATP, Mg2citrate, Mg2oxalate, Pi. PKc far sensitive inhibition Pi, compared PKp. Pi competitive inhibitor PKc respect phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (Ki = 1.3 mM). Glutamate potent inhibitor PKc, effect PKp. contrast Pi, glutamate mixed-type inhibitor PKc respect PEP (Ki = 0.7 mM). DHAP facilitated binding PEP isozymes reversed relieved inhibition PKc Pi and/or glutamate. regulatory properties PKp indicate likely less active light active dark. vivo activity PKc probably regulated relative cytosolic levels DHAP, Pi, glutamate; provides rationale activation algal cytosolic pyruvate kinase occurs periods enhanced ammonia assimilation.
