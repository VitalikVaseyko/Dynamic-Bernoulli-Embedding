 Blood ketone body levels increase starvation untreated diabetes. tested hypothesis ketone bodies directly inhibit insulin action skeletal muscle. investigated effect d,l-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH; major ketone body vivo) insulin-mediated glucose uptake (2-deoxyglucose) isolated mouse soleus (oxidative) extensor digitorum longus (EDL; glycolytic) muscle. BOH inhibited insulin-mediated glucose uptake soleus (but EDL) muscle time- concentration-dependent manner. Following 19.5 h exposure 5 mM BOH, insulin-mediated (20 mU/ml) glucose uptake inhibited approximately 90% (substantial inhibition also observed 3-O-methylglucose transport). inhibitory effect BOH reproduced d- l-BOH. BOH significantly affect hypoxia- AICAR-mediated (activates AMP-dependent protein kinase) glucose uptake. BOH effect require presence/utilization glucose since also seen glucose medium substituted pyruvate. determine whether BOH effect mediated oxidative stress, exogenous antioxidant (1 mM tempol) used; however, tempol reverse BOH effect insulin action. BOH alter levels total tissue GLUT4 protein insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation insulin receptor insulin receptor substrate-1 blocked insulin-mediated phosphorylation protein kinase B approximately 50%. data demonstrate BOH inhibits insulin-mediated glucose transport oxidative muscle inhibiting insulin signaling. Thus ketone bodies may potent diabetogenic agents vivo.
