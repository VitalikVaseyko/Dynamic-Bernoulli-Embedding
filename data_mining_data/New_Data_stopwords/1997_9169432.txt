 Chromatography immobilized antibodies specific nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase utilized affinity purification enzyme detergent extracts frog heart post-mitochondrial fractions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis eluates supports shows five polypeptides co-purify nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase. Tryptic digests band analyzed mass spectrometric microsequencing. Data base searches peptide mass matching sequence homology led identification proteins glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (40 kDa), creatine kinase (45 kDa), vimentin (55 kDa), pyruvate kinase (60 kDa), putative member antioxidant protein family (28 kDa). Distinct protein compositions found eluates lung liver extracts processed like manner. 28-kDa band vimentin associated NDP kinase tissues, co-purification pyruvate kinase seen liver, creatine kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase absent eluates lung liver. results suggest NDP kinase associated vimentin intermediate filaments antioxidant protein tissues, interacts energy metabolism enzymes tissue-specific manner.
