 cDNA encoding pyruvate kinase Schizosaccharomyces pombe isolated lambda ZAPII library. cDNA sequenced found contain open reading frame 1524 nucleotides, giving predicted protein subunit M, 55470. sequence shows high degree identity pyruvate kinase sequences, residues implicated binding substrate metal ion co-factors conserved. However, significant differences putative subunit interface effector binding regions may account unusual quaternary structure regulatory properties S. pombe enzyme.
