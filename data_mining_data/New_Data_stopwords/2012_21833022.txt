 Previously, shown pyruvate kinase, liver red cell isoform (PKLR) deficiency protects mice vivo blood-stage malaria, observed reduced PKLR function protects human erythrocytes Plasmodium falciparum replication ex vivo. Here, sequenced human PKLR gene 387 individuals malaria-endemic regions order assess genetic variability different geographical regions ethnic groups. Rich genetic diversity detected PKLR, including 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms several loss-of-function variants (frequency 1.5%). Haplotype distribution allele frequency varied considerably geography. Neutrality testing suggested positive selection genein sub-Saharan African Pakistan populations. possible positive selection involves malarial parasite.
