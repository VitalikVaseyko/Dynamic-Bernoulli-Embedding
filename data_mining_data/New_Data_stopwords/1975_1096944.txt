 Yeast pyruvate kinase (ATP : pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase EC 2.7.1.40) classified three groups based interaction fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinases Saccharomyces cerevisiae Saccharomyces carlsbergensis activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration range tested (up 10 mM) substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate; enzymes "fermentative Candida" (Candida tropicalis Candida utilis) affected fructose 1,6-biphosphate substrate concentration 2 mM. Although pyruvate kinase Candida lipolytica (a yeast belonging "oxidative Candida") also affected fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, degree activation extremely small compared four yeasts. pyruvate kinase C. tropicalis inhibited ATP strongly absence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate presence. case C. lipolytica enzyme, however, enzyme inhibited lesser extent ATP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate reverse inhibitory effect ATP. Time course changes enzyme levels yeasts grown glucose ethanol indicate pyruvate kinases S. cerevisiae C. tropicalis controlled allosteric mechanism changes enzyme concentration, although marked difference observed susceptibility allosteric effect fructose 1,6-biphosphate fermentative yeasts. hand, C. lipolytica would controlled latter mechanism.
