 eIF6 antiassociation factor regulates availability active 80S. activation driven RACK1/PKCbeta axis, mTORc1 independent manner. previously described eIF6 haploinsufficiency causes striking survival Emu-Myc mouse lymphoma model, lifespans extended 18 months. screen eIF6 expression human cancers. show Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma tumors (MPM) MPM cell line (REN cells) contain high levels hyperphosphorylated eIF6. Enzastaurin PKC beta inhibitor used clinical trials. prove Enzastaurin treatment decreases eIF6 phosphorylation rate, eIF6 protein stability. growth REN, vivo, metastasis reduced either Enzastaurin treatment eIF6 shRNA. Molecular analysis reveals eIF6 manipulation affects metabolic status malignant mesothelioma cells. Less glycolysis less ATP content evident REN cells depleted eIF6 treated Enzastaurin (Anti-Warburg effect). propose eIF6 necessary malignant mesothelioma growth, vivo, targeted kinase inhibitors.
