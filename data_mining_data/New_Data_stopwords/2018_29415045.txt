 Many differentiated cells rely primarily mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation generating energy form ATP needed cellular metabolism. contrast tumor cells instead rely aerobic glycolysis leading lactate extent respiration. Warburg found cancer cells support oxidative phosphorylation, tend ferment glucose energy source lactate even presence sufficient oxygen, inefficient way generate ATP. effect also occurs striated muscle cells, activated lymphocytes microglia, endothelial cells several mammalian cell types, phenomenon termed "Warburg effect". effect paradoxical first glance ATP production rate aerobic glycolysis much slower respiration energy demands better met pure oxidative phosphorylation. tackle question building minimal model including three combined reactions. new aspect extension earlier models take account possible uptake oxidation fermentation products. examine case cell allocate protein several enzymes varying distribution model linear programming problem objective maximize ATP production rate different combinations constraints enzymes. Depending cost reactions limitation substrates, leads pure respiration, pure fermentation, mixture respiration fermentation. model predicts fermentation products oxidized glucose scarce uptake severely limited.
