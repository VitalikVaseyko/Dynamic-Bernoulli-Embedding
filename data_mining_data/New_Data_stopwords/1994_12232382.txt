 Expression genes encoding enzymes involved specialized metabolic pathways assumed regulated coordinately maintain homeostasis plant cells. analyzed transcript levels rice (Oryza sativa L.) genes associated glycolysis alcohol fermentation submergence stress. transcript quantified several times, two types (I II) mRNA accumulation observed response submergence stress. Transcripts type genes reached maximum 24 h submergence reduced transfer aerobic conditions partial exposure shoot tips air. submergence-tolerant rice cultivar, transcript amounts several type genes, glucose phosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, increased significantly compared intolerant cultivar 24 h submergence. suggests mRNA accumulation type genes increases response anaerobic stress. mRNA accumulation type II genes, aldolase pyruvate kinase, reached maximum 10 h submergence. Following transfer aerobic conditions, transcript levels rapidly decreased type genes. results suggest mRNA levels genes engaged glycolysis alcohol fermentation may regulated differentially submergence stress.
