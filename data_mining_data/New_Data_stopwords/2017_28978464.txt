 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) continuously produced by-product mitochondrial metabolism eliminated via antioxidant systems. Regulation mitochondrially produced ROS required proper cellular function, adaptation metabolic stress, bypassing cellular senescence. Here, report non-canonical regulation cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mitochondrial ROS (mROS) functions maintain cellular metabolic homeostasis. demonstrate mitochondrial ROS physiological activator AMPK AMPK activation triggers PGC-1alpha-dependent antioxidant response limits mitochondrial ROS production. Cells lacking AMPK activity display increased mitochondrial ROS levels undergo premature senescence. Finally, show AMPK-PGC-1alpha-dependent control mitochondrial ROS regulates HIF-1alpha stabilization mitochondrial ROS promote Warburg effect cells lacking AMPK signaling. data highlight key function AMPK sensing resolving mitochondrial ROS stress resistance maintaining cellular metabolic balance.
