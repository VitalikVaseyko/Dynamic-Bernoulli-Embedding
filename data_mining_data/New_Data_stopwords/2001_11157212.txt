 examined nine Aspergillus japonicus isolates 10 Aspergillus aculeatus isolates using molecular biochemical markers, including DNA sequences ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene-ITS2 region, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), secondary-metabolite profiles. DNA sequence internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 ITS2) 5.8S rRNA gene could used distinguish A. japonicus A. aculeatus show two taxa closely related species black aspergilli. Aspergillus niger pyruvate kinase (pkiA) pectin lyase (pelA) Agaricus bisporus 28S rRNA genes, used probes RFLP analysis, revealed clear polymorphism two taxa. A. niger pkiA pelA probes placed six strains A. japonicus group 12 isolates A. aculeatus group, exhibited intraspecific variation probed pelA gene. secondary-metabolite profiles supported division isolates two species differed black aspergilli. strains classified A. japonicus produced indole alkaloids polar metabolite, A. aculeatus isolates produced neoxaline, okaramins, paraherquamidelike compounds, secalonic acid. A. aculeatus CBS 114.80 showed specific RFLP patterns loci examined. secondary-metabolite profile strain CBS 114.80 also differed A. japonicus A. aculeatus. Therefore, strain probably represents third taxon. study provides unambiguous criteria establishing taxonomic positions isolates black aspergilli, important relation industrial use legal protection organisms.
