 cure diabetes long sought using several different approaches, including islet transplantation, regeneration beta cells insulin gene therapy. However, permanent remission type 1 diabetes yet satisfactorily achieved. development type 1 diabetes results almost total destruction insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells autoimmune responses specific beta cells. Standard insulin therapy may maintain blood glucose concentrations within relatively narrow range occurs presence normal pancreatic beta cells. used recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) expresses single-chain insulin analogue (SIA), possesses biologically active insulin activity without enzymatic conversion, control hepatocyte-specific L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) promoter, regulates SIA expression response blood glucose levels. show SIA produced gene construct rAAV-LPK-SIA caused remission diabetes streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats autoimmune diabetic mice prolonged time without apparent side effects. new SIA gene therapy may potential therapeutic value cure autoimmune diabetes humans.
