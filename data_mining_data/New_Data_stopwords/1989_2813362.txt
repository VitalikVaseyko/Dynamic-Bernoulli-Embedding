 cDNA clone encoding human cytosolic thyroid hormone-binding protein (p58) isolated. human sequence found homologous rat pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) subtype M2. p58 monomer approximately 5% enzymatic activity tetrameric pyruvate kinase M2. tetrameric M2 bind 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Binding p58 T3 analogs resulted inhibition pyruvate kinase activity. apparent Ki values T3, L-thyroxine, D-T3 30 nM, 100 nM, 2 mM, respectively. L-Thyronine 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine effect. order activity correlates thermogenic effects reported T3 analogs. Conversion p58 tetramer reversible control fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. conversion inhibited T3 dose-dependent manner. Since pyruvate kinase key enzyme regulating cellular ADP, ATP, pyruvate, findings suggest p58 may involved mediating cellular metabolic effects induced thyroid hormones.
