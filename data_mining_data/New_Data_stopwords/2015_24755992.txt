 Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays pivotal role cellular responses hypoxia. Prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) degrades HIF-1alpha normoxic conditions hydroxylation HIF-1alpha proteolysis. Inhibiting PHD3 activity crucial up-regulating HIF-1alpha, thereby acting potential target treating hypoxia-related diseases. study, two proline analogues (PA1 PA2) screened PHD3 inhibitors apparent EC50 values 1.53 3.17 microM respectively, indicating good inhibition potency. Nine proteins, significantly regulated PA1, identified using 2-DE coupled MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM) alpha-enolase 1 (ENO1), key modulators glycolysis, directly regulated HIF-1alpha. Moreover, VEGF, signal protein stimulating angiogenesis, strongly promoted PA1. findings suggest PA1 stabilized HIF-1alpha well up-regulated glycolysis angiogenesis proteins. Herein, first time, systematically studied proline analogue PA1 PHD3 inhibitor, provides innovative evidence treatment HIF-related diseases.
