 BACKGROUND AIMS: Recent evidence suggests inflammatory cytokines may mediate reduced hepatic glucose production reduced blood glucose concentrations sepsis. Therefore aim study provide direct evidence cytokine-mediated interaction Kupffer cells hepatocytes characterising effects lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Kupffer cells hepatocyte gluconeogenesis, activity key regulatory enzymes pathway. METHODS RESULTS: Primary isolates hepatocytes co-cultured lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Kupffer cells Transwell inserts showed 48% inhibition gluconeogenesis (P < 0.001). RNase protection assay ELISA Kupffer cells culture media following exposure lipopolysaccharide showed increased levels interleukin-1 alpha beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha IL-10. addition IL-1beta IL-10 hepatocyte cultures inhibited gluconeogenesis 52% (P < 0.001), whereas cytokine alone ineffective. determine whether altered production activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase responsible reduced glucose synthesis, mRNA, protein levels enzyme activities measured. Primary hepatocytes co-cultured lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Kupffer cells cultured combination IL-1beta IL-10 displayed reduced levels phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA, protein enzyme activity. contrast mRNA, protein levels enzyme activity pyruvate kinase altered; suggesting gluconeogenesis suppressed downregulation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, hypoglycaemia, often observed sepsis, may mediated Kupffer cell-derived IL-1beta IL-10. addition study suggests cytokines inhibit phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase production thereby hepatic gluconeogenesis.
