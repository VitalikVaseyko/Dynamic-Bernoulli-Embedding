 role oxygen induction mitochondrial permeability transitions studied. Oxygen consumption, swelling, membrane potential calcium transport recorded simultaneously isolated rat liver mitochondria. Oxygen depletion accomplished saturating medium N2 allowing either mitochondrial respiration glucose/glucose oxidase consume residual oxygen. Upon anaerobiosis, mitochondria supplemented 500 microM ATP support succinate-driven membrane potential. conditions, 100 microM Ca2+ induced cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transitions. eliminate possible inhibition permeability transition high concentrations adenine nucleotides, anaerobic mitochondria also energized combination 20 microM ADP phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase. mitochondria also underwent Ca2+-induced permeability transition. conditions, namely addition ATP single actions pyruvate kinase, respiratory components totally reduced. Thus, oxygen necessary factor mitochondria undergo permeability transitions.
