 Leucine plays important role promoting muscle protein synthesis muscle remodelling. However, percentage leucine appropriate creep feed proteome profile alterations caused dietary leucine skeletal muscle piglets remain elusive. case, applied isobaric tags relative absolute quantitation analyse proteome profile longissimus dorsi muscles weanling piglets fed normal leucine diet (NL; 1.66 % leucine) high-leucine diet (HL; 2.1 % leucine). identified 157 differentially expressed proteins two groups. Bioinformatics analysis proteins exhibited suppression oxidative phosphorylation fatty acid beta-oxidation, well activation glycolysis, HL group. confirmation, identified SDHB, ATP5F1, ACADM HADHB significantly down-regulated (P<0.01, except ATP5F1, P<0.05), whereas glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase significantly up-regulated (P<0.05) HL group. also show enhanced muscle protein synthesis transition slow-to-fast fibres altered leucine. Together, results indicate leucine may alter energy metabolism promote slow-to-fast transitions skeletal muscle weanling piglets.
