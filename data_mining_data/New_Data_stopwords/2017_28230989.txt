 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) overexpressed cancer cells responsible aberrant glucose metabolism. previously described bis(4-morpholinyl thiocarbonyl)-disulfide (JX06, 16) first covalent inhibitor PDK1. Here, basis scaffold 16, identify two novel types disulfide-based PDK1 inhibitors. potent analogue, 3a, effectively inhibits PDK1 molecular (kinact/Ki = 4.17 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1)) cellular level (down 0.1 muM). contrast 16, 3a potent subtype-selective inhibitor PDK1 >40-fold selectivity PDK2-4. 3a also significantly alters glucose metabolic pathways A549 cells decreasing ECAR increasing ROS. Moreover, xenograft models, 3a shows significant antitumor activity negative effect mice weight. Collectively, data demonstrate 3a may excellent lead compound treatment cancer first-generation subtype-selective covalent PDK1 inhibitor.
