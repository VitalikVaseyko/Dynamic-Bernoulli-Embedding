 Activity changes number enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism determined cell extracts fractionated exponential-phase populations Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown excess glucose. Cell-size fractionation achieved improved centrifugal elutriation procedure. Evidence yeast populations fractionated according age cell cycle obtained examining various cell fractions volume distribution microscopic appearance flow cytometric analysis distribution patterns cellular DNA protein contents. Trehalase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase 1, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase showed changes specific activities throughout cell cycle, whereas specific activities alcohol dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase remained constant. basal trehalase activity increased substantially (about 20-fold) bud emergence decreased binucleated cells. However, enzyme activated pretreatment cell extracts cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, significant fluctuations activity seen. observations strongly favor posttranslational modification phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism underlying periodic changes trehalase activity cell cycle. observed trehalase, specific activities hexokinase phosphofructokinase 1 rose beginning bud formation onward, finally leading eightfold higher values end phase. Subsequently, enzyme activities dropped markedly later stages cycle. Pyruvate kinase activity relatively low G1 phase phase, increased dramatically (more 50-fold) G2. contrast three glycolytic enzymes investigated, highest specific activity gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase 1 found fractions enriched either unbudded cells single nucleus binucleated cells. observed changes enzyme activities likely underlie pronounced alterations carbohydrate metabolism cell cycle.
