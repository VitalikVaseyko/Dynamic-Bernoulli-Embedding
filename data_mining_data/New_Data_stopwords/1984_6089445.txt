 Normal values glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), glutathione reductase (GR), glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI), pyruvate kinase (PK) pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) determined normocytes, reticulocytes, newborn cord erythrocytes, leucocytes. Metabolic clinical aspects G6PD classification genetic variants reviewed. Enzyme determinations variation drug-induced haemolysis critically presented. Extensive tables published listing drugs compounds cause haemolysis G6PD-deficient patients, well preparations may, probably, administered safely. Clinical biochemical data patients inherited enzyme defects GR, GPI, PK, P5N, well acquired deficiency last-mentioned chronic lead intoxication, reviewed light personal experience field.
