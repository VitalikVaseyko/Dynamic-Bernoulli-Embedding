 Two groups Amphibolurus nuchalis, Australian agamid lizard, maintained captivity 8 wk. "trained" group given submaximal exercise 1 km/h motorized treadmill, 30 min/day, 5 days/wk; treadmill inclined 10% last 5 wk. "sedentary" group exercised. Endurance capacity change significantly either group, sprint speed decreased trained lizards. sedentary group exhibited significant decreases maximal O2 consumption, standard metabolic rate, heart mass, increase liver mass. Trained lizards exhibited significant decreases heart thigh muscle masses, significant increases liver mass, hematocrit, liver pyruvate kinase, heart citrate synthase activities. concluded adaptive response endurance training, typical mammals, generally occur lizards. Moreover, levels chronic activity would elicit adaptive responses mammals may excessive lizards may induce pathological effects joints skeletal muscle. ecological evolutionary significance conclusions discussed.
