 type metabolic compartmentalization occurs red blood cells differs types exist eukaryotic cells, intracellular organelles. red blood cells (ghosts), ATP sequestered within cytoskeletal-membrane complex. pools ATP known directly fuel Na(+)/K(+) Ca(2+) pumps. ATP entrapped within pools either incubation bulk ATP operation phosphoglycerate kinase pyruvate kinase reactions enzymatically generate ATP. pool filled nascent ATP, metabolic labeling Na(+)/K(+) Ca(2+) pump phosphoproteins (E(Na)-P E(Ca)-P, respectively) bulk [gamma-(32)P]-ATP prevented pool emptied various means. Importantly, pool also filled fluorescent ATP analog trinitrophenol ATP, well photoactivatable ATP analog, 8-azido-ATP (N(3)-ATP). Using fluorescent ATP, show ATP accumulates disappears membrane ATP pools filled subsequently emptied, respectively. loading N(3)-ATP membrane pool, demonstrate membrane proteins contribute pool's architecture photolabeled. aid antibody N(3)-ATP, identify labeled proteins immunoblotting characterize derived peptides mass spectrometry. analyses show specific peptides corral entrapped ATP derive sequences within beta-spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, GAPDH.
