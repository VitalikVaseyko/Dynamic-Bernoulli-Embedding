 PURPOSE: Prior studies laboratory demonstrated efficacy combined treatment low doses dietary agents curcumin phenylethylisothiocyanate effectively suppressing prostate cancer vitro human prostate cancer PC3 cells well vivo immunodeficient mice implanted PC3 cells. Hence, study undertaken examine potential chemopreventive properties two agents transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate. MATERIALS METHODS: efficacy AIN-76A diet supplemented 2% curcumin 0.05% PEITC combination 1% curcumin 0.025% PEITC periods 10 16 weeks tested adenocarcinoma mouse prostate. Immunohistochemistry Western blot analysis used examine expression proliferation apoptotic biomarkers. statistical tests two-sided. RESULTS: Supplementing AIN-76A diet dietary phytochemicals curcumin PEITC either alone combination, significantly decreased incidence prostate tumor formation (P = 0.0064). Immunohistochemistry revealed significant inhibition high-grade PIN (P = 0.0006, 0.000069, 0.00029 treatment period 10 weeks P = 0.02582, 0.022179, 0.0317 treatment period 16 weeks) along decreased proliferation increased apoptotic index curcumin, PEITC curcumin PEITC treated animals, respectively. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed downregulation Akt signaling pathway may part play role decreasing cell proliferation ultimately retarding prostate tumor formation. CONCLUSION: data lucidly evidence chemopreventive merits dietary phytochemicals curcumin PEITC suppressing prostate adenocarcinoma.
