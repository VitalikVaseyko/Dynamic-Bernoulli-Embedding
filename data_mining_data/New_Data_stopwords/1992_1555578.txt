 dose-dependent effect ethanol hepatic metabolism perfused rat liver investigated (a) 31P-NMR spectroscopy follow-up intracellular phosphorylated metabolites (b) HPLC compounds released effluents. Perfusion livers fed rats ethanol induced increase level sn-glycerol 3-phosphate net accumulations 3.30 +/- 0.33 0.69 +/- 0.15 mumol x g-1 wet liver reached 20 min, 70 mM 0.5 mM ethanol, respectively. sn-Glycerol-3-phosphate accumulation fully detected 31P NMR indicated comparing quantitations based NMR biochemical assays. Ethanol administration concentration 10 mM induced dose-dependent decrease release lactate + pyruvate liver. Lactate release decreased 1129 +/- 39 674 +/- 84 nmol x min-1 x g-1, pyruvate decreased 230 +/- 9 6.2 +/- 0.4 nmol x min-1 x g-1, 20 min perfusion 10 mM ethanol. Nevertheless, flux 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, measured accumulation sn-glycerol 3-phosphate release lactate + pyruvate, affected early phase ethanol oxidation. Finally, data obtained oxygen consumption, release acetate accumulation sn-glycerol 3-phosphate support involvement microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system catalysis ethanol oxidation, even high doses alcohol.
