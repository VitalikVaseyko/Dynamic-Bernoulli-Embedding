 Certain "degradation" products GLP-1 found possess beneficial effects metabolic homeostasis. Here, investigated function COOH-terminal fragment GLP-1, nonapeptide GLP-1(28-36)amide, hepatic glucose metabolism. C57BL/6 mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) 13 wk injected intraperitoneally GLP-1(28-36)amide 6 wk. significant reduction body weight gain response HFD feeding observed GLP-1(28-36)amide-treated mice. GLP-1(28-36)amide administration moderately improved glucose disposal glucose tolerance test drastically attenuated glucose production pyruvate tolerance test, associated reduced hepatic expression gluconeogenic genes Pck1, G6pc, Ppargc1a. Mice treated GLP-1(28-36)amide exhibited increased phosphorylation PKA targets, including cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), ATF-1, beta-catenin. primary hepatocytes, GLP-1(28-36)amide reduced glucose production expression Pck1, G6pc, Ppargc1a, associated increased cAMP content PKA target phosphorylation. effects attenuated PKA inhibition. suggest GLP-1(28-36)amide represses hepatic gluconeogenesis involving activation components cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. study confirmed GLP-1(28-36)amide possesses therapeutic potential diabetes metabolic disorders.
