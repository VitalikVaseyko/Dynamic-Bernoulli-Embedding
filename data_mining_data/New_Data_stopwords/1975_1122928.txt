 Reversible haemolytic anaemia associated decreased red cell half-life reticulocytosis studied 10 patients Zieve's syndrome. Since underlying cause red cell destruction yet unknown, determined critical metabolic functions red cells order define assumed intracorpuscular defect causing haemolysis. glucose metabolizing enzymes normal raised values. - view diminished ATP raised 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2.3 DPG) levels - combination suggests pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency - additional procedures carried order detect abnormal activity red cell PK. Studies biochemical properties PK thermostability, Michaelis-Menten constants, activation inhibition tests brought results markedly deviating norm.-Fractions containing old cells particularly disclosed PK instability. defective red cell matabolism resulted measurable ATP-instability, altered glucose utilization lactate production. - Experimental cell aging procedures led markedly decreased red cell metabolism. assays revealed mutations PK-control mechanisms might involved factor triggering haemolytic anaemia Zieve's syndrome.
