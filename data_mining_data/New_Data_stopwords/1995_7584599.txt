 four pyruvate kinase isozymes vertebrate tissues, designated L, M1, M2, R. Although pyruvate kinases purified characterized pig liver, muscle, kidney, heart, brain isozyme not. aim work purify, characterize make isozymic designation pig brain pyruvate kinase. Purification accomplished chromatography phosphocellulose, Sephadex G200, blue-dextran agarose columns. molecular weight native enzyme determined sucrose density centrifugation. degree purity, subunit molecular weight determined polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate. isoelectric point estimated rapid isoelectric focusing method sucrose gradients. pH optimum, kinetics presence absence fructose-1,6-diphosphate determined spectrophotometrically. purification scheme used resulted 382-fold purification pig brain pyruvate kinase, final specific activity 191 Units/mg protein. estimated scanning sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, purification scheme also resulted preparation least 98% purity. Pig brain pyruvate kinase native molecular weight approx. 230,000, subunit molecular weight approx. 60,000. pI determined approximately 8.0, pH optimum estimated pH 7.4. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate effect either Km phospho(enol)pyruvate, Vmax reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
