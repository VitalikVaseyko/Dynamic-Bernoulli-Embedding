 Evidence presented mitochondria contain ATP sensitive potassium channels (mK-ATP channels), may confer tissue protection upon activation. is, however, known whether activation mK-ATP channels direct effect mitochondrial ATP production. study performed define effect pinacidil (PIN) ATP production oxidative phosphorylation isolated cardiomyocyte pancreatic beta-cell mitochondria. Cardiomyocyte mitochondria produced seven times ATP beta-cell mitochondria presence pyruvate/malate. PIN inhibited pyruvate/malate-induced mitochondrial ATP production half maximal effect 360 microM cell types. inclusion 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) prevent inhibition. Succinate induced similar ATP production cardiomyocyte beta-cell mitochondria. beta-cell mitochondria succinate-induced ATP production inhibited PIN half maximal effects 500 microM PIN. However, cardiomyocyte mitochondria PIN stimulated succinate-induced ATP production 3-fold half maximal effect 100 microM maximal effect 200 microM. PIN-dependent stimulation mimicked rotenone. inclusion 5-HD could prevent PIN effects. conclusion, PIN may inhibit complex 1 respiratory chain without indications opening mK-ATP channels. cardiomyocytes metabolically inhibited succinate dehydrogenase results stimulation ATP production conferring tissue protection. beta-cells without metabolically inhibited succinate dehydrogenase, stimulation PIN tissue protection PIN expected.
