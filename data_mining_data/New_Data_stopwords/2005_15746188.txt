 aldose reductase pathway demonstrated key component myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. Previously, demonstrated increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, measure cytosolic NADH/NAD+, important change drives metabolic cascade mediating ischemic injury. study investigated signaling mechanisms aldose reductase pathway mediates myocardial ischemic injury. Specifically, influence aldose reductase pathway flux JAK-STAT signaling examined perfused hearts. Induction global ischemia rats resulted JAK2 activation followed STAT5 activation. Pharmacological inhibition aldose reductase sorbitol dehydrogenase blocked JAK2 STAT5 activation associated lower lactate/pyruvate ratio lower protein kinase C activity. Niacin, known lower cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio independent aldose reductase pathway inhibition, also blocked JAK2 STAT5 activation. Inhibition protein kinase C also blocked JAK2 STAT5 activation. Transgenic mice overexpressing human aldose reductase exhibited increased JAK2 STAT5 activation. Pharmacological inhibition JAK2 reduced ischemic injury improved functional recovery similar observed aldose reductase pathway inhibited mice hearts. data, first time, demonstrate JAK-STAT signaling aldose reductase pathway ischemic hearts is, part, due changes cytosolic redox state.
