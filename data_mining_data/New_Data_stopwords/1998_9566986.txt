 maximal activity mRNA abundance hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) lipogenic enzymes investigated rats meal-fed either high fructose (F) high cornstarch (C) diet. diet contained 50% F C (g/100 g), casein (20%), cornstarch (16.13%), corn oil (5%), minerals (5.37%), vitamins (1%) Solka-floc (2%). Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 44) randomly divided C F groups meal-fed 3 h/d; group subdivided exercise-trained (T) untrained (U) groups. Treadmill training performed 4 h initiation meal 25 m/min, 10% grade 2 h/d, 5 d/wk, 10 wk. Rats killed 9 h meal 27 h last training session. F-fed rats significantly higher activities lipogenic enzymes assayed mRNA abundance FAS acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase (ACC) C rats (P < 0.05). Concentrations plasma insulin glucose liver pyruvate altered F feeding. Proportions fatty acids 18:2 20:4 lower, whereas 16:0 16:1 higher, livers F C rats (P < 0.05). Training decreased FAS activity 50% (P < 0.05), without affecting FAS mRNA level C rats; down-regulation absent F rats. ACC mRNA abundance tended lower CT CU rats (P < 0.075). L-Type pyruvate kinase activity lower FT FU rats (P < 0.05), whereas lipogenic enzyme activities differ U rats diet group. conclude hepatic lipogenic enzyme induction high carbohydrate meal feeding may inhibited exercise training fructose-rich diet may attenuate training-induced down-regulation.
