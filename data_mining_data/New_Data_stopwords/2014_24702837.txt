 Warburg Effect showed energy metabolism cancer cells similar prokaryotic cells, different normal eucaryotic cells. Endosymbiotic Theory offered plausible explanation eucaryotic cells evolved prokaryotic cells, host cells (ancient prokaryotic cells) ingested mitochondria (ancient aerobic bacteria), depended oxidative phosphorylation rather glycolysis generating energy. alteration energy metabolism might mean survival style cancer cells re-evolution eucaryotic cells prokaryotic cells. alteration happened still unknown. hypothesis tries explain mitochondria take part re-evolution normal cell cancer cell.
