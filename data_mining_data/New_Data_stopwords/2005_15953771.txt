 Cryptosporidium parvum one major causes waterborne diseases worldwide. protozoan parasite depends mainly anaerobic oxidation glucose energy production. order identify differences three-dimensional structure key glycolytic enzymes C. parvum human host, expressed, purified crystallized recombinant versions three important glycolytic enzymes parasite, namely, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate dehydrogenase crystallized absence presence substrates cofactors, pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase crystallized apo-form. X-ray diffraction data collected crystals.
