 Hereditary xerocytosis (HX) rare disorder caused defects RBC permeability, associated haemolytic anaemia variable degree iron overload. sometimes misdiagnosed hereditary spherocytosis congenital haemolytic anaemia. Splenectomy contraindicated due increased risk thromboembolic complications. report clinical, haematological, molecular characteristics four patients two unrelated Italian families affected HX, associated beta-thalassemia trait heterozygous pyruvate kinase deficiency, respectively. Two patients splenectomised displayed thrombotic episodes. patients iron overload absence transfusion, two requiring iron chelation. diagnosis HX confirmed LoRRca Osmoscan analysis showing left-shifted curve. PIEZO1 gene sequencing revealed presence mutation p.E2496ELE, showing one frequent mutations disease. concomitant defects aggravate clinical phenotype; however, one patient, initial diagnosis pyruvate kinase deficiency delayed correct diagnosis HX many years resulted splenectomy followed thrombotic complications. study underlines importance precise diagnosis HX, particularly view splenectomy, need molecular confirmation suspected RBC enzymopathy.
