 Renewed interest immune cell metabolism led emergence research field aimed studying importance metabolic processes effective immune response. addition adaptive immune system, cells myeloid lineage shown undergo robust metabolic changes upon activation. Whereas specific metabolic requirements myeloid cells lipopolysaccharide/TLR4 stimulation extensively studied, recent evidence suggested model represent metabolic blueprint activated myeloid cells. Instead, different microbial stimuli, pathogens, tissue microenvironments lead specific complex metabolic rewiring myeloid cells. present overview metabolic heterogeneity activated myeloid cells health disease. Directions future research suggested ultimately provide new therapeutic opportunities. uniqueness metabolic signatures accompanying different conditions require tailor-made interventions ultimately modulate aberrant myeloid cell activation disease.
