 BACKGROUND: Patients inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) carry autoantibodies perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. aim current study characterize immune reactivity IBD. METHODS: used immunoproteomic approach extracts granulocytes serum ulcerative colitis (UC) patients controls identify target antigens. means Western blot analysis, screened 60 UC 60 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 60 diseased, 60 healthy controls antibodies. performed gene array experiments RNA extracted colonic mucosal biopsies 42 IBD patients six controls. RESULTS: identified aldolase A, phosphoglycerate mutase, alpha-enolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, malate dehydrogenase target antigens IBD. Seroreactivity least one five antigens detected 53.3% UC patients, 38.3% CD patients, 8.3% controls. Seroreactivity least two antigens detected 16.7% UC patients, 11.7% CD patients, none controls. Gene array experiments showed significant upregulation aldolase A, phosphoglycerate mutase, alpha-enolase, pyruvate kinase mRNA biopsies IBD patients, controls. UC CD patients also showed enhanced expression hypoxia-inducible factor-1, transcription factor induces expression glycolytic enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients show strong seroreactivity toward enzymes involved glycolysis. IBD patients also increased colonic mRNA expression glycolytic enzymes, triggered hypoxia transcription factor HIF-1.
