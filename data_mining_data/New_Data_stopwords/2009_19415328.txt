 80 years ago, Otto Warburg described phenomenon whereby cancer cells avidly take glucose produce lactic acid aerobic conditions, process subsequently referred Warburg effect aerobic glycolysis. exact molecular mechanisms underlying cancers reliance glycolysis remains unclear, likely combination epigenetic response hypoxic tumour environment combination direct oncogenic stimulation. aim current manuscript review normal process glycolysis highlight alterations occur malignant transformation, consider potential advantages glycolytic respiration cancer cell survival, finally explore areas altered glucose metabolism exploited clinical benefit.
