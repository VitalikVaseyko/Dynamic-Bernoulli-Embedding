 Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) endocrine hormone originally discovered corpuscles Stannius, endocrine glands kidneys bony fishes, also identified mammals. mammalian STC1 gene widely expressed various tissues appears involved diverse biological processes. growing evidence suggest altered patterns gene expression role human cancer development. Recently STC1 identified stimulator mitochondrial respiration hypothesized functionally related Warburg effect, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 plays key role reprogramming tumor metabolism. prompted us examine involvement HIF-1 regulation STC1 expression tumor hypoxia. data reveal hypoxia stimulate STC1 gene expression various human cancer cell lines, including derived colon carcinomas, nasopharyngeal cancer (CNE-2, HONE-1, HK-1), ovarian cancer (CaOV3, OVCAR3, SKOV3). far, greatest response observed CNE-2 cells. studies CNE-2 cells, desferrioxamine, cobalt chloride, O(2) depletion increased HIF-1alpha protein STC1 mRNA levels. Desferrioxamine treatment, coupled Fe replenishment, abolished effects. RNA interference studies confirmed endogenous HIF-1alpha key factor hypoxia-induced STC1 expression. ability vascular endothelial growth factor stimulate STC1 expression CNE-2 cells comparatively low. Collectively, present findings provide first evidence HIF-1 regulation STC1 expression human cancer cells. studies implications role STC1 hypoxia induced adaptive responses tumor cells.
