 Warburg effect means higher glucose uptake cancer cells compared normal tissues, whereas smaller fraction glucose employed oxidative phosphorylation. advent high throughput technologies computational systems biology, cancer cell metabolism reinvestigated last decades toward identifying various events underlying "how" "why" cancer cell employs aerobic glycolysis. Significant progress shaped revise Warburg effect. study, integrated gene expression 13 different cancer cells genome-scale metabolic network human (Recon1) based E-Flux method, analyzed based constraint-based modeling. Results show regardless significant up- down-regulated metabolic genes, distribution metabolic changes similar different cancer types. findings support theory Warburg effect consequence metabolic adaptation cancer cells.
