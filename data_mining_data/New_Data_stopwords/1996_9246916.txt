 Red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) pyruvate kinase (PK) levels estimated patients leukemias, see consistent enzyme defect correlation enzyme levels stage disease prognostic assessment. G6PD levels found significantly increased decreased majority patients acute leukemias. Increased activity seen majority patients L1 decreased activity L2 subtype acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) G6PD activity consistently increased, levels highly elevated chronic phase moderately blast phase. Variation G6PD activity found related stage disease prognostic significance. PK found normal decreased. Fetal haemoglobin levels also estimated 30 patients leukemias found elevated patients. Red cell G6PD may useful staging disease, prognostic indicator predictor relapse.
