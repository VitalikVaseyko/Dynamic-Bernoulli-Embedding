 sensitive pyrosequencing-compatible method determining copy number short tandem repeat (STR) presented study. Escherichia coli ligase catalyzes ligation primer probes complementary proper sites target DNA template, converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine monophosphate (AMP) nicotinamide. AMP release level proportional copy number STR measured using adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, luciferase. Unlike current standard methods based electrophoresis, present assay sensitive point mutation. Furthermore, determination copy number tandem repeat using proposed method, DNA templates, primer probes immobilized onto super paramagnetic beads washed pyrosequencing applied remaining DNA sequencing. assay specially efficient handle large number samples massively parallel tests could executed microplate photometer. Furthermore, work pyrosequencing sequencing like genome sequencing.
