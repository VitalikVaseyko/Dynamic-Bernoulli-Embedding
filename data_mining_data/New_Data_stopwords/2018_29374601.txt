 Multiple studies shown protein kinase Bbeta (AKT2) involved development progression ovarian cancer, however, precise role remains unclear. explored underlying molecular mechanisms AKT2 promotes ovarian cancer progression. examined effects AKT2 vitro two ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 HEY), vivo metastasis assay nude mice. migration invasion ability SKOV3 HEY cells determined transwell assay. Overexpression knockdown (with shRNA) experiments carried unravel underlying signaling mechanisms induced AKT2. Overexpression AKT2 led increased expression pyruvate kinase (PKM2) ovarian cancer cells lung metastatic foci nude mice. Elevated AKT2/PKM2 expression induced cell migration invasion vitro, well lung metastasis vivo; silencing AKT2 blocked effects. Meanwhile, PKM2 overexpression unable increase AKT2 expression. expressions p-PI3K, p-AKT2, PKM2 increased stimulated epidermal growth factor (EGF); however, expressions blocked inhibited PI3K LY294002. STAT3 expression elevated NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation activated vitro vivo either AKT2 PKM2 overexpressed; effects inhibited silencing AKT2 expression. Taken together, AKT2 increases migration invasion ovarian cancer cells vitro promotes lung metastasis nude mice vivo PKM2-mediated elevation STAT3 expression NF-kappaB activation. conclusion, highlight novel mechanism AKT2-PKM2-STAT3/NF-kappaB axis regulation ovarian cancer progression, work suggested AKT2 PKM2 may potential targets treatment ovarian cancer.
