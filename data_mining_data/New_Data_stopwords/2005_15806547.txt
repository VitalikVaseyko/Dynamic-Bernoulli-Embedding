 series previous reports established implementing metabolic flux, NMR/MS, Northern blot analysis glyoxylate shunt, TCA cycle, acetate uptake acetyl-CoA synthetase active Escherichia coli BL21 Escherichia coli JM109. differences accepted reason differences glucose metabolism acetate excretion two strains. Examination bacterial metabolism microarrays time course Northern blot showed addition glyoxylate shunt, TCA cycle acetate uptake, metabolic pathways active differently two strains. gluconeogenesis, sfcA shunt, ppc shunt, glycogen biosynthesis, fatty acid degradation. found E. coli JM109, acetate produced pyruvate oxidase (poxB) using pyruvate substrate rather phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (Pta-AckA) system uses acetyl-CoA. inactivation gluconeogenesis enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (ppsA), activation anaplerotic sfcA shunt, low stable pyruvate dehydrogenase (aceE, aceF) cause pyruvate accumulation converted acetate pyruvate oxidase B. behavior ppsA, acs, aceBAK JM109 dependent glucose supply strategy. glucose concentration high, transcription genes observed acetate concentration increased, low glucose concentrations genes expressed acetate concentration decreased. possible major regulatory molecule controls ppsA aceBAK also acs. gluconeogenesis pathway (fbp, pckA, ppsA) leads glycogen accumulation constitutively active E. coli BL21 regardless glucose feeding strategy.
