 Mutants Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) described. less 0.5% pyruvate kinase activity wild type. glycolytic enzymes present normal amounts mutants. mutation recessive segregates diploids single gene. Five alleles examined fail complement one another. Tetrad analysis mitotic recombination data place mutation left arm chromosome distal cys 1. majority single-step spontaneous revertants glucose regain enzyme activity fully activity appears, number criteria, due enzyme present wild type. revertants become nuclear petites. mutants neither grow ferment sugars grow ethyl alcohol pyruvate. Glucose addition cultures growing alcohol arrests growth glucose exhausted. steady state rate glucose utilization slower wild type. associated accumulation much 5 micronmoles P-enolpyruvate per g wet weight cells proportional amounts 2-P-glyceric 3-P glyceric acids. mutation believed involve regulatory element synthesis pyruvate kinase.
