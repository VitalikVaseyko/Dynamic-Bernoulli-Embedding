 Sepsis leading cause mortality U.S. Europe. Sepsis septic shock results severe metabolic abnormalities following infection. Aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg Effect) much hallmark sepsis cancer. Warburg observed cancer cells generated energy glycolysis (generation ATP degradation glucose, usually associated anaerobic conditions) rather oxidative phosphorylation (generation ATP mitochondrial inner membrane via tricarboxylic acid cycle, usually associated aerobic conditions). Although initial pathways cancer sepsis may different, mechanisms allow aerobic glycolysis occur, even presence oxygen, similar. review provides evidence reversing steps reverses Warburg Effect model systems pathological consequences effect. Therefore, implies steps might modifiable sepsis reverse Warburg Effect possibly lead better outcomes.
