 Hepatocytes prepared rats treated dexamethasone 2 3h maintained presence 10 microM-dexamethasone preparation incubation buffers showed significantly elevated rates gluconeogenesis compared prepared control animals. Dexamethasone treatment also increased sensitivity cells glucagon catecholamines. Analysis concentrations metabolites gluconeogenic pathway indicated dexamethasone decreased intracellular concentration pyruvate increased phosphoenolpyruvate, acetyl-CoA citrate, suggesting stimulation reaction(s) converting pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate. substantiated analysis pattern metabolites found mitochondrial compartment digitonin fractionation cells. Inclusion 3-mercaptopicolinate incubation enhanced effect hormone distribution metabolites. Thus, absence effect steroid level phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase, dexamethasone treatment still increased formation malate, aspartate citrate pyruvate, indicating stimulation intact cell pyruvate carboxylase. suggested stimulation pyruvate carboxylase result general activation mitochondrial function, increase intramitochondrial concentrations acetyl-CoA ATP, decrease glutamate enhanced intramitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] ratio.
