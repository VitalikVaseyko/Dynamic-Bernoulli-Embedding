 UNLABELLED: Soybean nutritionally important crop, exhibits reduced growth yields flooding stress. investigate soybean responses post-flooding recovery, gel-free proteomic technique used examine protein profile hypocotyl. Two-day-old soybeans flooded 2 days hypocotyl collected flooding post-flooding recovery period. total 498 70 proteins significantly changed control post-flooding recovering soybeans, respectively. Based proteomic clustering analyses, three proteins selected mRNA expression enzyme activity assays. Pyruvate kinase increased flooding, gradually decreased post-flooding recovery period protein abundance, mRNA, enzyme activity levels. Nucleotidylyl transferase decreased flooding increased post-flooding recovery mRNA expression enzyme activity levels. Beta-ketoacyl reductase 1 increased flooding decreased recovery protein abundance mRNA expression levels, enzyme activity gradually increased post-flooding recovery period. results suggest pyruvate kinase, nucleotidylyl transferase, beta-ketoacyl reductase play key roles post-flooding recovery soybean hypocotyl promoting glycolysis generation ATP regulation secondary metabolic pathways. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: study analyzed post-flooding recovery response mechanisms soybean hypocotyl, model organ studying secondary growth, using gel-free proteomic technique. Mass spectrometry analysis proteins extracted soybean hypocotyls identified 20 common proteins control flooding-stressed soybeans changed significantly abundance time. hypocotyl proteins changed post-flooding recovery assigned protein, development, secondary metabolism, glycolysis categories. analysis revealed three proteins, pyruvate kinase, nucleotidylyl transferase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, increased hypocotyl flooding conditions post-flooding recovery. proteins involved glycolysis, nucleotide synthesis amino acid activation, complex fatty acid biosynthesis.
