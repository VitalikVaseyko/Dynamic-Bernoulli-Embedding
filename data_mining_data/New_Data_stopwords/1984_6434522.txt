 Transport sugars across cytoplasmic membranes gram-positive bacteria appears regulated action metabolite-activated, ATP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates seryl residue phosphocarrier protein phosphotransferase system, HPr. developed quantitative assay measuring activity enzyme Streptococcus pyogenes. product vitro protein kinase-catalyzed reaction shown phosphoseryl-HPr several independent criteria (rates hydrolysis presence various agents, detection serine-phosphate acid hydrolysates, immunological assay, electrophoretic migration rates). HPrs isolated four different gram-positive bacteria (S. pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis) shown phosphorylated kinase S. pyogenes. contrast, Escherichia coli HPr substrate enzyme. soluble kinase released particulate fraction cells high salt presence protease inhibitor shown approximate molecular weight 60,000 estimated gel filtration. activity dependent divalent cations, Mg2+ Mn2+ active. EDTA, Pi, high concentrations salt strongly inhibitory. enzyme optimally active pH 7.0, exhibited high affinity substrates, dependent presence one several metabolites. compounds, fructose 1-6-diphosphate active, gluconate 6-phosphate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate exhibiting moderate low stimulatory activities. compounds tested, including variety sugar phosphates, pyridine nucleotides, metabolites without effect. ATP-dependent phosphorylation HPr seryl residue strongly inhibited phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation active histidyl residue protein. Treatment kinase diethyl pyrocarbonate strongly inhibited ATP-dependent phosphorylation activity, although sulfhydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetate without effect. results serve characterize HPr (serine) kinase, apparently regulates rates carbohydrate transport streptococcal cells via phosphotransferase system. primary role kinase control cellular inducer levels carbohydrate metabolic rates proposed.
