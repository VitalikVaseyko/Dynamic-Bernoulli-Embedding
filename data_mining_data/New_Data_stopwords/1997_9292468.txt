 Three days protocol 225 pliometric (lengthening) contractions administered situ extensor digitorum longus muscles rats, force deficit 64 +/- 7% percentage damaged muscle fibers 38 +/- 5% control values. tested hypothesis 3 h 3 days protocol elevation muscle vitamin E content would decrease force deficit, percentage damaged muscle fibers, serum activities creatine kinase pyruvate kinase. 5-8 days intravenous injections alpha-tocopherol increased muscle vitamin E content threefold compared vehicle (ethanol)-treated rats. Despite difference vitamin E content, force deficit number damaged fibers different. contraction protocol, serum creatine kinase pyruvate kinase activities vehicle-treated rats increased fourfold 3 h twofold 3 days, whereas vitamin E-treated rats showed change. conclude vitamin E treatment ameliorate either induction injury severe secondary injury 3 days. Despite absence evidence antioxidant function, lack increase serum enzyme activities vitamin E-treated rats 3 h 3 days supported role vitamin E prevention enzyme loss muscle damage.
