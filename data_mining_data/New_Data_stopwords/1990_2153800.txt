 exploit well documented effect 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-DPG) enhancing oxygen delivery human erythrocytes, investigated whether DPG synthase/phosphatase enzyme system targeted increase DPG levels cell. hydrolytic activity (phosphatase) DPG metabolizing enzyme complex exhibits marked dependence physiological effector, 2-phosphoglycolate. Little phosphatase activity detected absence activator irrespective concentrations substrate. phosphoglycolate-dependent phosphatase activity competitively inhibited glycolytic intermediate, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA). 3-PGA inhibition persists 2,3-DPG concentration raised saturation level. contrast, 3-PGA enhances DPG synthase activity dose-dependent manner. intact red cells, one-half cellular DPG content depleted 6 hr 37 degrees C glucose-free medium. rate 2,3-DPG degradation accelerated cellular level phosphoglycolate increased incubation exogenous glycolate. Together, results indicate 2,3-DPG content erythrocytes directly regulated modulation phosphatase/synthase activities. support notion, pyruvate kinase inhibitor, L-alanine, increases 2-fold cellular 3-PGA level. accompanied significant increase (30%) 2,3-DPG content human red blood cells. postulated DPG-promoting action 3-PGA mediated simultaneous phosphatase inhibition synthase activation. Furthermore, result increased DPG accumulation, oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve L-alanine-treated cells rightward shifted 2.5 torr.
