 BACKGROUND: last years, evidence accumulated increased expression pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme (PKM2) related neoplastic transformation well plasma concentrations might marker lung cancer progression. MATERIALS METHODS: present manuscript immunohistochemical technique used detect expression two pyruvate kinase isoforms: PKM1 (muscle isozyme PK) PKM2 well Ki-67 antigen paraffin sections 218 cases non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) different histological types grades malignancy. RESULTS: significant correlation expressions pyruvate kinase isoforms NSCLC types found (r=0.42, p<0.0001). Expression levels PKM1 PKM2 independent histological classification tumor patients' clinicopathological data. CONCLUSIONS: PKM2 PKM1 value predictive markers NSCLC regardless histological type grade malignancy.
