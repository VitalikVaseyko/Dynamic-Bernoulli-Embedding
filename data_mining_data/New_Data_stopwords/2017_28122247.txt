 Targeting defects metabolism underutilized strategy treatment cancer. Arginine auxotrophy resulting silencing argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) common metabolic alteration reported broad range aggressive cancers. assess metabolic effects arise acute chronic arginine starvation ASS1-deficient cell lines, performed metabolite profiling. found pharmacologically induced arginine depletion causes increased serine biosynthesis, glutamine anaplerosis, oxidative phosphorylation, decreased aerobic glycolysis, effectively inhibiting Warburg effect. reduction glycolysis cells otherwise dependent aerobic glycolysis correlated reduced PKM2 expression phosphorylation upregulation PHGDH. Concurrent arginine deprivation glutaminase inhibition found synthetic lethal across spectrum ASS1-deficient tumor cell lines sufficient cause vivo tumor regression mice. results identify two synthetic lethal therapeutic strategies exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities ASS1-negative cancers.
