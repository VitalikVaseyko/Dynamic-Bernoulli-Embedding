 oncoprotein c-Myc plays important role regulating glycolysis normoxia; yet, cancer cells, HIF1alpha, essential driving glycolysis hypoxia, often up-regulated even presence oxygen. relationship two major regulators Warburg effect remains fully defined. demonstrate regulation long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), named IDH1-AS1, enables c-Myc collaborate HIF1alpha activating Warburg effect normoxia. c-Myc transcriptionally repressed IDH1-AS1, which, upon expression, promoted homodimerization IDH1 thus enhanced enzymatic activity. resulted increased alpha-KG decreased ROS production subsequent HIF1alpha down-regulation, leading attenuation glycolysis. Hence, c-Myc repression IDH1-AS1 promotes activation Warburg effect HIF1alpha. such, IDH1-AS1 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, whereas silencing IDH1-AS1 promoted cell proliferation cancer xenograft growth. Restoring IDH1-AS1 expression may therefore represent potential metabolic approach cancer treatment.
