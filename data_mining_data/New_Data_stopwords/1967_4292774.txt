 1. activities key enzymes glycolysis gluconeogenesis measured embryonic chick, sheep rat livers. 2. chicken activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase low, glucose 6-phosphatase fructose diphosphatase high; converse situation exists rat (Burch et al. 1963), sheep activities phosphofructokinase fructose diphosphatase high, activities hexokinase glucose 6-phosphatase low. findings discussed relation carbohydrate metabolism embryonic livers. 3. regulatory properties fructose diphosphatase embryonic livers three species compared properties enzymes adult animals. inhibitions AMP fructose diphosphate effects Mg(2+) pH activities adult foetal fructose diphosphatase almost identical. 4. concluded regulatory properties characteristic fructose diphosphatase embryonic adult tissue, importance relation enzyme development discussed.
