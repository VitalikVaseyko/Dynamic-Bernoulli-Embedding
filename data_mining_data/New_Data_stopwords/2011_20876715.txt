 OBJECTIVE: Excess tissue iron levels risk factor diabetes, mechanisms underlying association incompletely understood. previously published mice humans form hereditary iron overload, hemochromatosis, exhibit loss beta-cell mass. effect sufficient, however, fully explain diabetes risk phenotype associated forms iron overload. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: therefore examined glucose fatty acid metabolism hepatic glucose production vivo vitro mouse model hemochromatosis gene often mutated human disease, HFE, deleted (Hfe(-)(/)(-)). RESULTS: Although Hfe(-)(/)(-) mice exhibit increased glucose uptake skeletal muscle, glucose oxidation decreased ratio fatty acid glucose oxidation increased. high-fat diet, Hfe(-)(/)(-) mice exhibit increased fatty acid oxidation hypermetabolic. decreased glucose oxidation skeletal muscle due decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme activity related, turn, increased expression PDH kinase 4 (pdk4). Increased substrate recycling liver contributes elevated hepatic glucose production Hfe(-)(/)(-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Increased hepatic glucose production metabolic inflexibility, characteristics type 2 diabetes, may contribute risk diabetes excessive tissue iron.
