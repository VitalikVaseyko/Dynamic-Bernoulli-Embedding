 Cell adhesion mediated selectins carbohydrate ligands, sialyl Lewis X sialyl Lewis A, figures heavily cancer metastasis. Expression carbohydrate determinants markedly enhanced cancer cells, molecular mechanism leads cancer-associated expression sialyl Lewis X/A well understood. Results recent studies indicated involvement two principal mechanisms accelerated expression sialyl Lewis X/A cancers; 'incomplete synthesis' ' neo synthesis.' 'incomplete synthesis,' recently found modified forms sialyl Lewis X sialyl Lewis non-malignant colonic epithelium, additional 6-sulfation 2 --> 6 sialylation. impairment GlcNAc 6-sulfation 2 --> 6 sialylation upon malignant transformation leads accumulation sialyl Lewis X/A colon cancer cells. Epigenetic changes DNA methylation and/or histone deacetylation suggested lie behind incomplete synthesis. mechanism called ' neo synthesis,' recent studies indicated cancer-associated alterations sugar transportation intermediate carbohydrate metabolism play important roles. Cancer cells known exhibit metabolic shift oxidative elevated anaerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), correlated increased gene expression sugar transporters glycolytic enzymes induced common cancer-specific genetic alterations. increased sialyl Lewis X/A expression cancer link chains events recent results indicated events accompany transcriptional induction set genes closely related expression.
