 Tumor necrosis-factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) member TNF-superfamily selectively induces apoptosis death receptors (DRs) 4 and/ DR5 cancer cells, without affecting normal cells. Unfortunately, many clinical studies shown cancer cells acquire TRAIL-resistance thus avoid TRAIL-induced apoptosis. current study, newly found PTBP1, splicer protein plays important role energy metabolism highly expressed TRAIL-resistant human colon cancer DLD-1. Interestingly, silencing PTBP1 using siRNA PTBP1 (siR-PTBP1) resulted significant increase TRAIL-sensitivity along switching pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms PKM2 PKM1, leading impaired Warburg effect, intracellular ATP levels significantly increased production lactate decreased. Notably, siR-PTBP1 canceled resistance increasing expression level DR5 effectively inducing translocation DR5 cell surface membrane. Also, siR-PTBP1 up-regulated expression level CCN1, contributed enhanced sensitivity TRAIL-induced apoptosis. findings indicate silencing PTBP1, thus impairing Warburg effect positively affected TRAIL-induced apoptosis splicer protein may thus serve possible target molecule cancel resistance cancer cells TRAIL.
