 achieve liver-directed expression sufficient amounts therapeutic genes successful safe gene therapy, natural liver-specific promoters used direct expression therapeutic genes liver, whereas strong viral enhancers used obtain sufficient amounts expressed therapeutic gene products. However, often use either former latter guarantee potent liver-specific therapeutic gene expression. conglomerate thus create potent tissue-specific promoter characterizing using liver-type pyruvate kinase proximal promoter (LPKPP) harboring TATA box HNF-1alpha binding site. Alone hardly activated reporter gene expression non-hepatocytes hepatocytes. However, presence SV40 viral enhancer (SV40VE), active multiple cell types, able potently activate reporter gene expression specifically hepatocytes. tissue-specific activation LPKPP viral enhancer attributed HNF-1alpha binding LPKPP. Taken together, results support idea constitutively active SV40VE could used activate LPKPP tissue-specific manner presence HNF-1alpha. knowledge, first study utilize HNF-1alpha binding site, context LPKPP, generate basal promoter transcriptionally activated potently tissue-specific manner viral enhancer active multiple cell types.
