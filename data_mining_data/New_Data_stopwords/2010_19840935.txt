 Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, antagonist phytopathogenic fungi rhizosphere crop plants, elaborates excretes several secondary metabolites antibiotic properties. synthesis depends three small RNAs (RsmX, RsmY, RsmZ), whose expression positively controlled GacS-GacA two-component system high cell population densities. find regulatory links primary secondary metabolism P. fluorescens related species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, searched null mutations affected central carbon metabolism well expression rsmY-gfp rsmZ-gfp reporter constructs without slowing growth rate rich media. Mutation pycAB genes (for pyruvate carboxylase) led down-regulation rsmXYZ secondary metabolism, whereas mutation fumA (for fumarase isoenzyme) resulted up-regulation three small RNAs secondary metabolism absence detectable nutrient limitation. effects required GacS sensor kinase accessory sensors RetS LadS. analysis intracellular metabolites P. fluorescens revealed strong positive correlation small RNA expression pools 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate. conclude Krebs cycle intermediates (already known control GacA-dependent virulence factors P. aeruginosa) exert critical trigger function secondary metabolism via expression GacA-dependent small RNAs.
