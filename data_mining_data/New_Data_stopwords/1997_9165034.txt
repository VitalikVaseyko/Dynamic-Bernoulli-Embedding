 Genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats present impaired response hepatic glucose production inhibition insulin. work, investigated modulation hormone epinephrine-stimulated gluconeogenesis, hepatocytes isolated obese (fa/fa) rats lean (Fa/-) littermates. Epinephrine (1 microM) caused maximal stimulation [14C]lactate conversion [14C]glucose hepatocytes isolated either obese lean animals. stimulation gluconeogenesis epinephrine accompanied significant reduction fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, inactivation pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase, 2-fold increase cellular concentrations cAMP. presence insulin incubation medium antagonized, concentration-dependent manner, effects epinephrine. hepatocytes isolated lean rats, reversion caused insulin complete, concentration required half-maximal insulin action ranging 0.22 0.56 nM. contrast, obese rat hepatocytes, insulin partially blocked epinephrine-mediated effects, sensitivity insulin 2- 4-fold lower, indicated corresponding half-maximal insulin action values. Furthermore, insulin (10 nM) almost completely blocked increase cAMP levels induced epinephrine lean rat hepatocytes, whereas provoked small nonsignificant reduction epinephrine-stimulated levels cyclic nucleotide hepatocytes obtained obese rats.
