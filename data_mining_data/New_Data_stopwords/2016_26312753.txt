 BACKGROUND: Warburg effect one hallmarks cancer rapidly proliferating cells. known hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) MYC proteins cooperatively regulate expression HK2 PDK1 genes, respectively, Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cell line P493-6, carrying inducible MYC gene repression system. However, mechanism aerobic glycolysis BL cells yet fully understood. METHODS FINDINGS: Western blot analysis showed HIF1A protein highly expressed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive BL cell lines. Using biochemical assays quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), found that-unlike lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs)-the MYC protein master regulator Warburg effect BL cell lines. Inhibition transactivation ability MYC influence aerobic glycolysis LCLs, led decreased expression MYC-dependent genes lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) activity BL cells. CONCLUSIONS: data suggest aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, BL cells regulated MYC expressed high levels, whereas LCLs, HIF1A responsible phenomenon.
