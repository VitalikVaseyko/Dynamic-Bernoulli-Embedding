 Many pathological states characterized muscle atrophy (e.g., sepsis, cachexia, starvation, metabolic acidosis severe insulinopenia) associated increase circulating glucocorticoids (GC) levels, suggesting GC could trigger muscle atrophy observed conditions. GC-induced muscle atrophy characterized fast-twitch, glycolytic muscles atrophy illustrated decreased fiber cross-sectional area reduced myofibrillar protein content. GC-induced muscle atrophy results increased protein breakdown decreased protein synthesis. Increased muscle proteolysis, particular activation ubiquitin proteasome lysosomal systems, considered play major role catabolic action GC. stimulation GC two proteolytic systems mediated increased expression several Atrogenes ("genes involved atrophy"), FOXO, Atrogin-1, MuRF-1. inhibitory effect GC muscle protein synthesis thought result mainly inhibition mTOR/S6 kinase 1 pathway. changes muscle protein turnover could explained changes muscle production two growth factors, namely Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-I, muscle anabolic growth factor Myostatin, muscle catabolic growth factor. review discuss recent progress made understanding mechanisms involved GC-induced muscle atrophy consider implications advancements development new therapeutic approaches treating GC-induced myopathy. article part Directed Issue entitled: Molecular basis muscle wasting.
