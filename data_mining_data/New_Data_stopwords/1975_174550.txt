 1. new rapid continuous assay rat liver microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17) developed. based measurement UDP production UDP-glucuronate glucuronidation reaction; UDP production continuously measured coupling conversion NADH NAD+ pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. assay independent acceptor substrate used; several findings confirm applicability. 2. glucuronidation rate series phenol derivatives determined assay, using Triton X-100-activated microsomal preparation enzyme source. Conjugation series nitrophenol derivatives also investigated 'classical' assay (measurement disappearance yellow colour nitrophenol glucuronidation). substrate highest conversion rate 3-methyl-2-nitrophenol. 3. electron releasing electron withdrawing ring substituents increased glucuronidation rate phenol derivatives, compared phenol. 4. Lipid solubility seems important determining conversion rate: poorly lipid-soluble substrates glucuronidated low rate high lipid solubility seems prerequisite high conversion rate. Glucuronidation poorly lipid-soluble compounds may limited diffusion. 5. consequences findings interpretation studies heterogeneity enzyme discussed.
