 Fibroblast growth factor (FGF21) plays important role regulating hepatic oxidation fatty acids gluconeogenesis response fasting consumption ketogenic diet. However, metabolic pathways FGF21 regulates hepatic function well defined. identify effects FGF21 liver vivo, administered FGF21 mice analyzed acute effects signaling gene expression. found FGF21 acts directly liver stimulate phosphorylation fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 ERK1/2. Acute FGF21 treatment induced hepatic expression key regulators gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, ketogenesis including glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase type 1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1alpha. addition, injection FGF21 associated decreased circulating insulin free fatty acid levels. FGF21 treatment induced mRNA protein expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC-1alpha), suggesting PGC-1alpha may play role regulating FGF21 action. However, studies using mice liver-specific ablation PGC-1alpha revealed regulation gluconeogenic gene expression FGF21 seen wild-type mice, indicating PGC-1alpha necessary effect FGF21 glucose metabolism. data demonstrate FGF21 acts directly liver modulate hepatic metabolism. direct effects examined dependent PGC-1alpha. addition, FGF21 treatment associated decreased serum insulin levels affect hepatic function.
