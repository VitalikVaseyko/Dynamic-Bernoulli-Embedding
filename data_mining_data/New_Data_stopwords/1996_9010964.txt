 objective study examine effects volume replacement recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA), developed reduce consumption human blood derivatives, maintaining hepatic energy metabolism. Hemorrhagic shock mean blood pressure 50 mmHg induced within 20 min maintained 60 min Wiggars' method rabbits. Fluid resuscitation replacing two thirds blood withdrawn plasma-derived 5% human serum albumin (pHSA; n = 7) rHSA (n = 10), replacing double volume blood withdrawn lactated Ringer's solution (n = 7) completed within 20 min, observed 120 min. significant differences observed blood pressures, blood gas analyses, blood counts, biochemical parameters (e.g., alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine) blood glucose levels among three groups. also significant differences parameters hepatic energy metabolism blood pyruvate lactate levels ratios, ketone body concentrations ratios, hepatic tissue energy charge levels among experimental groups. suggested volume replacement rHSA, like pHSA, able maintain hemodynamics organ function hemorrhagic shock, particularly hepatic energy metabolism.
