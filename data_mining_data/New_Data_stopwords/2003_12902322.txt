 Cellular adaptations endurance training influenced intensity duration exercise. examine impact exercise intensity duration acute transcriptional regulation metabolic genes red (RG) white (WG) gastrocnemius muscle, rats completed either low-intensity [ approximately 50% maximal O2 uptake (VO2 max)] treadmill exercise (LIE) 45 min, LIE 180 min, high-intensity ( approximately 75% VO2 max) exercise (HIE) 45 min. LIE 45 min activated (P < 0.05) transcription pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4), uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), hexokinase II (HK II) genes RG within 1 h exercise. WG, transcription PDK4, UCP3, HKII, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) also induced, whereas transcription HO-1 gene change. RG, extending LIE duration 45 180 min elicited similar activation PDK4 UCP3 ( approximately 15-fold) far greater increase HO-1 (>30-fold) HKII transcription (>25-fold). WG, extending LIE 180 min induced much greater prolonged (through 2- 4-h recovery) activation PDK4, UCP3 (both >200-fold), HO-1 (>10-fold). HIE elicited similar pattern gene activation LIE RG WG, exception HIE triggered >10-fold activation HO-1 WG. data provide evidence intensity duration exercise affect transcriptional regulation metabolic genes muscle fiber type-specific manner, possibly reflecting relative stress imposed exercise bout.
