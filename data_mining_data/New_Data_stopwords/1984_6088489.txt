 Using cDNA probe complementary rat L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs, studied respective roles glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, glucagon, insulin induction specific mRNAs liver animals refed either maltose-rich fructose-rich diet. Neither adrenalectomized thyroidectomized diabetic animals could express L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs liver refed carbohydrate-rich diets. animals given missing hormone, level hybridizable mRNAs returned normal values administration hormone alone failed induce mRNA synthesis fasted animals. glucagon cyclic AMP abolished induction L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs refed animals. Exogenous insulin, whatever dose, could reverse inhibitory action glucagon. Insulin usually regarded main regulator L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression. appears glucagon, beside regulating enzyme activity phosphorylation mechanisms, may also modulate L-type pyruvate kinase synthesis pre-translational level. Consequently, results show three conditions required synthesis liver L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs: (i) presence dietary carbohydrates, (ii) cessation glucagon release, (iii) presence permissive hormones, including insulin.
