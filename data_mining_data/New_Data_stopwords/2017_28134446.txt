 aim present study investigate influence Cs(+) cultured human cells. find HeLa cell growth suppressed addition 10 mm CsCl culture media. Cs(+) -treated cells, intracellular Cs(+) K(+) concentrations increased decreased, respectively. leads decrease activity glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase, uses K(+) cofactor. Cs(+) -treated cells show intracellular pH shift towards alkalization. Based results, CsCl presumably suppresses HeLa cell proliferation inducing intracellular cation imbalance affects cell metabolism. findings may implications use Cs(+) cancer therapy.
