 Rats fed diet containing 15% oxidized frying soybean oil (OFO) shown significantly lower tissue alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) concentration rats fed 15% fresh soybean oil diet. examine turnover alpha-tocopherol, depletion-repletion experiment radioisotope tracer study conducted. Two groups male weanling Long-Evans rats fed vitamin E-deficient diets containing either 15% OFO 15% vitamin E-stripped fresh soybean oil (control). 9 wk depletion, rats fed OFO diet significantly higher plasma pyruvate kinase (PK) activity lower concentrations alpha-T RBC, adrenal gland, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, testis muscle compared controls (P < 0.05), indicating vitamin E-deficient status aggravated feeding OFO diet. 12 wk, depleted rats intraperitoneally injected dose all-rac-alpha-T (2.5 mg/rat, dissolved Vitamin E-stripped corn oil) every day. Three doses administered rat 1-wk repletion period. Plasma PK activity decreased groups (P < 0.05) repletion OFO rats still significantly higher control group. repleted OFO gorup also significantly lower alpha-T concentration adrenal gland, epididymal fat, liver spleen repleted control group. Two rats group vitamin E-depleted 16 wk injected intraperitoneally single dose 5-methyl-14C-RRR-alpha-T (740 kBq/kg body weight). week dosing, radioactivity excreted urine feces OFO group 1.3- 1.7-fold, respectively, control group. Tissue retention radioactivity also lower OFO rats control rats. results suggest alpha-T body catabolized turned rats fed OFO-containing diet.
