 previously demonstrated impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion (IS) ATP elevation islets Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, nonobese model diabetes, significantly restored 30-60-min suppression endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. study, investigated effect longer (12 h) suppression ROS metabolism-secretion coupling beta-cells exposure tempol, superoxide (O2(-)) dismutase mimic, plus ebselen, glutathione peroxidase mimic (TE treatment). GK islets, H2O2 O2(-) sufficiently reduced glucose-induced ATP elevation improved TE treatment. Glucose oxidation, indicator Krebs cycle velocity, also improved TE treatment high glucose, whereas glucokinase activity, determines glycolytic velocity, affected. Lactate production markedly increased GK islets, TE treatment reduced lactate production protein expression lactate dehydrogenase hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha). results indicate Warburg-like effect, characteristic aerobic metabolism cancer cells lactate overproduced reduced linking mitochondria metabolism, plays important role impaired metabolism-secretion coupling diabetic beta-cells suggest ROS reduction improve mitochondrial metabolism suppressing lactate overproduction inhibition HIF1alpha stabilization.
