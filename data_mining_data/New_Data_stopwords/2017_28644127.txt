 Rapid cellular proliferation early development cancer depends glucose metabolism fuel macromolecule biosynthesis. Metabolic enzymes presumed regulators glycolysis-driven metabolic program, known Warburg effect; however, identified. uncover previously unappreciated role Mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) metabolic enzyme required maintain Warburg metabolism zebrafish embryos primary malignant mammalian cells. functional consequences MPI loss striking: glycolysis blocked cells die. phenotypes caused induction p53 accumulation glycolytic intermediate fructose 6-phosphate, leading engagement hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), increased O-GlcNAcylation, p53 stabilization. Inhibiting HBP genetic chemical methods reverses p53 stabilization rescues Mpi-deficient phenotype. work provides mechanistic evidence MPI loss induces p53, identifies MPI novel regulator p53 Warburg metabolism.
