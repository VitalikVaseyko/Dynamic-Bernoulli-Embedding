 Epidemiological clinical observations provide consistent evidence regular intake aspirin may effectively inhibit occurrence epithelial tumors; however, molecular mechanisms completely understood. present study, determined ability aspirin acetylate post-translationally modify cellular proteins HCT-116 human colon cancer cells understand potential mechanisms may exerts anti-cancer effects. Using anti-acetyl lysine antibodies, demonstrate aspirin causes acetylation multiple proteins whose molecular weight ranged 20 200 kDa. identity proteins determined, using immuno-affinity purification, mass spectrometry immuno-blotting. total 33 cellular proteins potential targets aspirin-mediated acetylation, 16 identified common control aspirin-treated samples. include enzymes glycolytic pathway, cytoskeleton proteins, histones, ribosomal mitochondrial proteins. glycolytic enzymes identified include aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase B chains. Immunoblotting experiment showed aspirin also acetylated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase transketolase, enzymes pentose phosphate pathway involved ribonucleotide biosynthesis. vitro assays enzymes revealed aspirin affect pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activity; however, decreased glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Similar results also observed HT-29 human colon cancer cells. Selective inhibition glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase may represent important mechanism aspirin may exert anti-cancer effects inhibition ribonucleotide synthesis.
