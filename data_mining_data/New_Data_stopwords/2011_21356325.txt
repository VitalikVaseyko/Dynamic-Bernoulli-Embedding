 Although hagfishes ecologically important members benthic communities little data available metabolism. oxygen consumption, enzyme activities, muscle proximate composition shallow living Eptatretus stoutii deeper living E. deani measured investigate hagfish metabolism. low rates oxygen consumption aerobic anaerobic enzyme activities body musculature confirmed low metabolism hagfishes. However, significant variation oxygen consumption existed. E. stoutii significantly lower rates compared deeper living E. deani two shallow living species literature data used. species could regulate oxygen consumption low oxygen concentrations. Epatretus deani, lives oxygen minimum zone, significantly lower critical oxygen tension (0.83 kPa) compared E. stoutii (1.47 kPa). deeper E. deani greater lipid stores E. stoutii may reflect deeper habitat sporadic food supply.
