 BACKGROUND: Barringtonia racemosa medicinal plant belonging Lecythidaceae family. water extract B. racemosa leaf (BLE) shown rich polyphenols. Despite diverse medicinal properties B. racemosa, information major biological effects underlying molecular mechanisms still lacking. METHODS: study, effect antioxidant-rich BLE gene expression HepG2 cells investigated using microarray analysis order shed light molecular mechanism associated medicinal properties plant. RESULTS: Microarray analysis showed total 138 genes significantly altered response BLE treatment (p < 0.05) fold change difference least 1.5. SERPINE1 significantly up-regulated gene 2.8-fold HAMP significantly down-regulated gene 6.5-fold. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) revealed "Cancer, cell death survival, cellular movement" top network affected BLE score 44. top five canonical pathways associated BLE Methylglyoxal Degradation III followed VDR/RXR activation, TR/RXR activation, PXR/RXR activation gluconeogenesis. expression genes encode enzymes involved methylglyoxal degradation (ADH4, AKR1B10 AKR1C2) glycolytic process (ENO3, ALDOC SLC2A1) significantly regulated. Owing Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis cancer cells may increase level methylglyoxal, cytotoxic compound. CONCLUSIONS: BLE potential developed novel chemopreventive agent provided cytotoxic effects related methylglyoxal accumulation minimized normal cells rely aerobic glycolysis energy supply.
