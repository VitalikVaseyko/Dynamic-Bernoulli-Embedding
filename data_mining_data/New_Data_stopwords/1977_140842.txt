 influence clofibrate glycolytic pathway liver studied. changes activity glucokinase hexokinase significant. reduction phosphofructokinase (p less 0.05) pyruvate kinase activity found (p less 0.0005) clofibrate feeding. vitro inhibition enzymes could demonstrated clofibrate concentration 2.5 mM. Crossover plots glycolytic intermediates indicate reduced pyruvate kinase activity may influence glycolytic pathway vivo. Clofibrate feeding induces lower ATP:ADP ratio, lower adenylate energy charge elevates AMP levels rat liver. may possibly stimulate hepatic glycogenolysis glucose utilisation organ.
