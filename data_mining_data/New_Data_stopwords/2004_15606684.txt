 Compounds trace element vanadium exert various insulin-like effects vitro vivo systems. include ability improve glucose homeostasis insulin resistance animal models Type 1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus. addition animal studies, several reports documented improvements liver muscle insulin sensitivity limited number patients Type 2 diabetes. effects are, however, dramatic observed animal experiments, probably lower doses vanadium used duration therapy short human studies compared animal work. ability compounds stimulate glucose uptake, glycogen lipid synthesis muscle, adipose hepatic tissues inhibit gluconeogenesis, activities gluconeogenic enzymes: phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase glucose-6-phosphatase liver kidney well lipolysis fat cells contributes potential mechanisms anti-diabetic insulin-like effects. cellular level, vanadium activates several key elements insulin signal transduction pathway, tyrosine phosphorylation insulin receptor substrate-1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase B activation. pathways believed mediate metabolic actions insulin. protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) considered negative regulators insulin-signalling pathway, suggested vanadium enhance insulin signalling action virtue capacity inhibit PTPase activity increase tyrosine phosphorylation substrate proteins. concerns potential toxicity available inorganic vanadium salts higher doses long-term therapy. Therefore, new organo-vanadium compounds higher potency less toxicity need evaluated efficacy potential treatment human diabetes.
