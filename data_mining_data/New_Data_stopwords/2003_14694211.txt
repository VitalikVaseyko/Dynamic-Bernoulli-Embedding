 OBJECTIVE: determine effect high-fat diet expression genes important fat oxidation, protein abundance transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms alpha gamma, selected enzyme activities type II skeletal muscle. RESEARCH METHODS PROCEDURES: Sprague-Dawley rats consumed either high-fat (HF: 78% energy, n = 8) high-carbohydrate (64% energy, n = 8) diet 8 weeks remaining sedentary. RESULTS: expression genes important fat oxidation tended increase type (soleus) type II (extensor digitorum longus) fiber types HF dietary intervention. However, expression muscle type carnitine palmitoyltransferase increased extensor digitorum longus. Analysis gene expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator fork-head transcription factor O1 demonstrated alteration response HF diet. Similarly, PPARalpha PPARgamma protein levels also altered HF diet. DISCUSSION: HF diet increased expression array genes involved lipid metabolism, subtle differences evident response within differing skeletal muscle fiber types. Despite changes gene expression, effects diet peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator fork-head transcription factor O1 mRNA protein abundance PPARalpha PPARgamma.
