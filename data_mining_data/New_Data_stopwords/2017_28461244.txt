 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), key enzyme regulating aerobic glycolysis, overexpressed many human cancers, correlates poor clinical outcomes. Aerobic glycolysis hallmark cancer, drugs targeting regulators, including LDHA, developed. However, mechanisms LDHA inhibition physiological significance LDHA inhibitors cancer cells unclear. Here, show microRNA-30a-5p (miR-30a-5p) suppresses LDHA expression directly targeting 3'-UTR. inhibition LDHA, miR-30a-5p dampens glycolysis decreasing glucose uptake, lactate production, ATP generation, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), increasing oxygen consumption rate (OCR) breast cancer cells. Importantly, glycolysis regulated miR-30a-5p critical regulating breast tumor growth metastasis vitro vivo. breast cancer patients, miR-30a-5p expression negatively correlated LDHA expression. Moreover, patients increased glucose uptake tumors assessed PET scans showed decreased miR-30a-5p expression increased expression LDHA. findings provide clues regarding role miR-30a-5p tumor suppressor breast cancer inhibition LDHA. Targeting LDHA miR-30a-5p could potential therapeutic strategy breast cancer.
