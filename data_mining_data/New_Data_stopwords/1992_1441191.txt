 comparative biochemical study enzymes glycogenolysis, glycolysis hexose monophosphate shunt pathway various fractions (cyst wall, cyst fluid zoites) sarcocysts Sarcocystis fusiformis oesophageal muscles naturally infected Indian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) carried out. pattern magnitude enzymic activity differed markedly fractions. Phosphorylase, hexokinase, aldolase pyruvate kinase showed highest levels activity zoites fractions, whereas lactate dehydrogenase highest cyst fluid. Alcohol dehydrogenases non-detectable. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase localized cyst wall only. Zoites considered active metabolic sites glucose breakdown.
