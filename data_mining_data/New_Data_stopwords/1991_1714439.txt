 work deviation liver metabolism cytokines, especially recombinant human interleukin 1-alpha (rhIL1-alpha), investigated. Administration rhIL1-alpha recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rhTNF/cachectin) normal mice resulted rapid, dose-dependent induction high liver ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. effects cytokines liver ODC indirect effects mediated eicosanoids. induction liver ODC rhIL1-alpha least partly direct effect hepatocytes, due increase de novo synthesis enzyme protein increase ODC mRNA. specific protein required increase level ODC-mRNA. IL1 treatment, actinomycin caused superinduction liver ODC, least partly due increased stability ODC enzyme, actinomycin doubled apparent half-life (from 50 95 min). Daily administration 2 x 10(3) U rhIL1-alpha mice 3 days also caused decrease level differentiated type pyruvate kinase isozyme (PK-L) marked increase prototype isozyme (PK-M2) liver, cause significant change isozyme patterns kidney, thymus, spleen. RhIL1-alpha also induced hypertrophy spleen. results indicate rhIL1-alpha causes metabolic deviation liver similar tumor-bearing hosts.
