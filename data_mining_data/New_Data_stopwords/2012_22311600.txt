 Tyrosine levels abnormally elevated tissues physiological fluids patients inborn errors tyrosine catabolism, especially tyrosinemia type II, caused deficiency tyrosine aminotransferase provokes eyes, skin, central nervous system disturbances. Considering mechanisms brain damage disorders poorly known, study, investigated vivo vitro effects tyrosine parameters energy metabolism cerebral cortex 14-day-old Wistar rats. observed 2 mM tyrosine inhibited vitro pyruvate kinase (PK) activity inhibition prevented 1 mM reduced glutathione 30, 60, 90 min preincubation. Moreover, administration tyrosine methyl ester (TME) (0.5 mg/g body weight) decreased activity PK reduction prevented pre-treatment creatine (Cr). hand, tyrosine alter adenylate kinase (AK) activity vitro, administration TME enhanced AK activity prevented Cr pre-treatment. Finally, TME administration decreased activity CK cytosolic mitochondrial fractions diminution prevented Cr pre-treatment. results suggest tyrosine alters essential sulfhydryl groups necessary CK PK functions, possibly oxidative stress. case also occurs patients, possible energy metabolism alterations may contribute, along mechanisms, neurological dysfunction hypertyrosinemias.
