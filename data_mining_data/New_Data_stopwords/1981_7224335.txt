 examined effect 6-wk exercise training program several skeletal enzymes patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Eight trained arms 7 trained legs. patients, muscle biopsy specimens taken trained limbs, 7 patients, additional biopsy specimens taken untrained limbs. enzymes examined citrate synthase, 3-beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase. Also examined cardiac frequency responses incremental endurance cycle ergometry; responses evaluated arm leg exercise, respectively. Despite patient's increased exercise endurance, unable document significant increase enzyme concentrations trained limbs. Similarly, analyses cardiac frequency failed show evolution typical cardiovascular training response. pattern marked contrast seen normal subjects endurance training. conclude patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease incapable exercising intensity high enough induce classic training response associated changes muscle enzymes. Therefore, mechanisms must important explaining increased endurance submaximal exercise.
