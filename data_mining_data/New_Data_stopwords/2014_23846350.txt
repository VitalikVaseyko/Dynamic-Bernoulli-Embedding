 biochemical events involved upregulation selected glucoseresponsive genes 3OmethylDglucose (3MG) remain elucidated. present study mainly aimed reevaluate possible role 3MG phosphorylation upregulation thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) liver pyruvate kinase (LPK) genes rat hepatocytes INS1E cells. TXNIP LPK transcription assessed rat liver INS1E cells exposed rise Dglucose concentration, 2deoxyDglucose (2DG), 3MG and, required, Dmannoheptulose. phosphorylation D[U14C]glucose 3O[14C]methylDglucose (14C-labeled 3-MG) measured rat liver, INS1E cell rat pancreatic islet homogenates. utilization D[53H]glucose intact INS1E cells also measured. rat hepatocytes, rise Dglucose concentration increased TXNIP/hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) LPK/HPRT ratios, 2DG 3MG also increased TXNIP/HPRT ratio, LPK/HPRT ratio. INS1E cells, TXNIP/HPRT LPK/HPRT ratios increased response addition Dglucose, 2DG 3MG. Furthermore, Dmannoheptulose abolished response Dglucose 2DG, 3MG, cells. Liver cell homogenates catalyzed phosphorylation 3MG modest extent, whilst INS1E rat pancreatic islet cell homogenates not. Moreover, 3MG marginally decreased Dglucose phosphorylation INS1E cell homogenates liver cell homogenates. D[53H]glucose utilization intact INS1E cells decreased 2DG, 3MG. findings reinforce view upregulation TXNIP LPK genes induced 3MG attributable phosphorylation favorable effect Dglucose metabolism.
