 development toxicity 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-9-(4,6,-O-thenylidene-beta-glucopyranoside) epipodophyllotoxin oncolytic activity, characterized mice treated three times 3-day intervals 10 mg drug i.p. per kg body weight. Changes organ function general metabolism determined measuring 18 constituents blood 10 weeks drug administration. results indicate three distinct phases toxicity 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-(4,6-O-2-thenylidene-beta-glucopyranoside). Acute toxicity developed within first 10 days expressed depressed hematocrit elevated plasma levels glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, amylase, lipase, uric acid. 4 weeks, levels ahd returned normal. acute phase followed chronic phase, characterized progressive decreases plasma levels glucose, cholesterol, albumin, total protein. Finally, 7 weeks treatment, terminal phase indicated correlated increases glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen became apparent. Plasma levels creatine phosphokinase, calcium, inorganic phosphate, total bilirubin, ketones, alkaline phosphatase change. Although pancreas liver marrow affected acute toxicity, boserved changes blood components chronic terminal phases correlate best continued hepatotoxicity. present evidence delayed toxicity 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-(4,6-o-2-thenylidene-beta-D-glucopyranoside) compatible irreversible hepatotoxocity leads metabolic deficiencies terminates death mice.
