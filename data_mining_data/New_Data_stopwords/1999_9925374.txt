 Muscle deconditioning common observation patients congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular diseases prolonged bed rest. gain insight metabolic mechanical properties deconditioned slow-twitch (soleus) fast-twitch (EDL) skeletal muscles, induced experimental muscle deconditioning hindlimb suspension (HS) rats 3 weeks. Cardiac muscle also studied. Besides profound muscle atrophy, increased proportion fast type II fibers well fast myosin isoenzymes, found decreased calcium sensitivity Triton X-100 skinned fiber bundles soleus muscle directed towards fast muscle phenotype. Glycolytic enzymes hexokinase pyruvate kinase increased, LDH isoenzyme pattern clearly shifted oxidative anaerobic profile. Creatine kinase (CK) myokinase activities increased HS soleus towards EDL values. Moreover, M-CK mRNA level greatly increased soleus, change EDL. However, oxygen consumption rate assessed situ saponin skinned fibers (12.5 +/- 0.8 C 15.1 +/- 0.9 micromol O2/min/g dw HS soleus compared 7.3 +/- 1.3 micromol O2/min/g dw control EDL), well mitochondrial CK (mi-CK) citrate synthase activities, preserved HS soleus. Following deconditioning change Km ADP mitochondrial respiration, either absence (511 +/- 92 C 511 +/- 111 microM HS soleus compared 9 +/- 4 microM control EDL) presence creatine (88 +/- 10 C 95 +/- 16 microM HS soleus compared 32 +/- 9 microM control EDL), found. results show muscle deconditioning induces biochemical functional slow fast phenotype transition myofibrillar cytosolic compartments postural muscle, mitochondrial compartment, suggesting compartments differently regulated conditions decreased activity.
