 Glucose homeostasis carnivorous (cat) omnivorous (rat) animal fed high-protein, low-carbohydrate (HP) diet followed pattern similar previously found carnivorous birds [Am. J. Physiol. 234 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 3): R115-R121, 1978]. Thus, compared controls given carbohydrate-rich (HC) diets. HP-fed animals had, fed state, lower levels blood sugar, lower concentrations liver glycogen, tendency reduced body glucose mass. fasting, liver glycogen little mobilized glycemia remained remarkably constant. Accordingly, body glucose mass remained unchanged. Gluconeogenic capacity, already high fed state, activated fasting. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity actually decreased rat liver cytosol, remaining unchanged cat liver cytosol mitochondria. [3H]glucose turnover studies revealed HP-fed cats rats glucose replacement rates fed state high HC-fed animals resistance glycemia fasting depended high gluconeogenic capacity efficient reduction glucose utilization.
