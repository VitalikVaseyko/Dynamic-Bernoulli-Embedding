 Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 master transcription factor, up-regulates glycolysis, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis hypoxia. HIF-1alpha accumulates normoxic tumor cells, leading glycolysis aerobic conditions. phenomenon, known "Warburg effect," caused yet unknown mechanism. show transformed cells express constitutively active pp60(c-Src) (Src) express HIF-1alpha protein normoxia, results expression multiple HIF-1alpha target genes. show occurrence due enhanced rate HIF-1alpha protein synthesis due reduced HIF-1alpha degradation. Furthermore, show Src-induced increase protein synthesis due global increase rate cap-dependent translation involve inhibition HIF-1alpha degradation.
