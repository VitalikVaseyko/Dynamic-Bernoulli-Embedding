 phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphatase purified homogeneity germinating mung beans (Vigna radiata). found tetrameric protein (molecular mass 240,000 daltons) made apparently identical subunits (subunit molecular mass 60,000 daltons). free bound nucleotides. show pyruvate kinase activity. enzyme showed high specificity PEP. Pyrophosphate esters (nucleoside di- triphosphates) hydrolyzed slowly phosphoric acid monoesters hydrolyzed. enzyme showed maximum activity pH 8.5. pH, K(m) PEP 0.14 millimolar V(max) equal 1.05 micromoles pyruvate formed per minute per milligram enzyme protein. Dialysis enzyme 10 millimolar triethanolamine buffer (pH 6.5), led loss catalytic activity, restored addition Mg(2+) ions (K(m) = 0.12 millimolar). divalent metal ions inhibited Mg(2+) -activated enzyme. PEP-phosphatase inhibited ATP several metabolites.
