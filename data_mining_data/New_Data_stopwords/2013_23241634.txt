 present study hepatitis B virus X antigen binding protein 1 (XBP1) cloned inducing expression, subcellular localization function examined. Total RNA extracted HepG2 cells XBP1 amplified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed restriction enzyme digestion pGBKT7 yeast plasmid identification enzyme digestion. plasmid transformed AH109 yeast via lithium acetate method protein extracts prepared. XBP1 protein expression eukaryotic cells determined using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis western blot analysis. gene encoding XBP1-binding protein screened liver cells using yeast two-hybrid technology. transfected human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line observed intracellular localization gene expression protein using fluorescence microscope, followed prokaryotic expression XBP1 gene identification. 921-bp XBP1 gene fragment obtained via RT-PCR amplification 20 proteins known functions interact XBP1 screened, including metallothionein, smooth muscle cell-related protein, asialoglycoprotein receptor, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 sequence unknown functions. green fluorescent protein expression plasmid pEGFP-C1-XBP1 XBP1 constructed successfully expression protein localized cytoplasm. 56-kDa recombinant protein successfully obtained via prokaryotic expression demonstrated good specificity using western blot analysis. XBP1 gene, expresses XBP1 protein, located cytoplasm plays role intracellular structure, cell growth, intracellular metabolism signal transduction pathway, well DNA duplication, transcription, recombination repair.
