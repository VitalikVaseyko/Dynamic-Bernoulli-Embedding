 carried genetic analysis pyruvate kinase (PykTk) phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PpsTk) hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodakarensis. principle, enzymes catalyse final step modified Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway found Thermococcales, conversion phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate, former utilizing ADP, latter dependent AMP phosphate. Enzyme activities transcript levels PykTk PpsTk increased T. kodakarensis glycolytic conditions compared cells grown pyruvate amino acids. Using KW128, tryptophan auxotrophic mutant trpE gene disruption, host strain, obtained mutant strains single gene disruptions either pykTk (Deltapyk strain) ppsTk (Deltapps strain) gene. Specific growth rates cell yields examined various media compared host KW128 strain. results indicated enzymes participated pyruvate metabolism, essential. presence maltooligosaccharides, Deltapyk strain displayed 15% decrease growth rate compared host strain, indicating PykTk participate glycolysis. However even dramatic effect observed Deltapps strain strain could grow maltooligosaccharides. results clearly indicate that, contrast conventional EM pathway dependent pyruvate kinase, PEP synthase essential enzyme glycolytic conversion PEP pyruvate T. kodakarensis. physiological roles two enzymes various growth conditions discussed.
