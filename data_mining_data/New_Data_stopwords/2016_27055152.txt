 Warburg effect probably prominent metabolic feature cancer cells, although little known underlying mechanisms consequences. Here, set study features detail number leukemia backgrounds. transcriptomes human CB CD34+ cells transduced various oncogenes, including BCR-ABL, MLL-AF9, FLT3-ITD, NUP98-HOXA9, STAT5A KRASG12V analyzed detail. data indicate particular BCR-ABL, KRASG12V STAT5 could impose hypoxic signaling normoxic conditions. coincided upregulation glucose importers SLC2A1/3, hexokinases HIF1 2. NMR-based metabolic profiling performed CB CD34+ cells transduced BCR-ABL versus controls, cultured normoxia hypoxia. Lactate pyruvate levels increased BCR-ABL-expressing cells even normoxia, coinciding enhanced glutaminolysis occurred HIF1/2-dependent manner. Expression glutamine importer SLC1A5 increased BCR-ABL+ cells, coinciding increased susceptibility glutaminase inhibitor BPTES. Oxygen consumption rates also decreased upon BPTES treatment, indicating glutamine dependency oxidative phosphorylation. current study suggests BCR-ABL-positive cancer cells make use enhanced glutamine metabolism maintain TCA cell cycle activity glycolytic cells.
