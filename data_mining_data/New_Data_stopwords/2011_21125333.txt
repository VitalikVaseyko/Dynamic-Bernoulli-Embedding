 Objective identify candidate biomarkers Squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) three ethnics Xinjiang well reveal molecular mechanism. Proteins 15 pairs ESCC matching adjacent normal esophageal tissues (five pairs ethnic Kazakh, Uygur Han) separated 2-DE differentially proteins identified matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS. identified Mascot database, interesting proteins confirmed 175 pairs ESCC immuno histochemistry. Comparison patterns revealed 20 proteins significantly changed, 12 protein concordantly increased, ACTB protein, COMT protein, Syntaxin binding protein Pyruvate Kinase (PKM2), Cathepsin D, Chromosome 1 open reading frame 8, Heat shock protein 27, Cdc42, Proteosome, LLDBP, Immunoglobulin, TNF receptor associated factor 7; eight protein spots concordantly decreased intensity ESCC, Adenylate kinase 1, General transcription factor II H, Smooth muscle protein, Trangelin, Early endosome antigen 1, Annexin A2, Fibrin beta, Tropomyosin. significant difference protein overexpression PKM2 (74.9%) Cathepsin (85.1%) ESCC compared adjacent tissues (P < 0.05) immunohistochemistry. Further, overexpression Cathepsin obvious difference Hazakh ESCC (94.7%) Uygur (78.6%) (P < 0.05). Interestingly, overexpression Cathepsin reversely associated ESCC differentiation (P < 0.05). Twenty proteins differentially-expressed ESCC normal tissues identified. Cathepsin PKM2 first time observed dysregulated Kazakh's ESCC. Moreover, Cathepsin may play complicated role carcinogenesis cell-differentiation ESCC.
