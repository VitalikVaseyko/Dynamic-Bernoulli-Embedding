 Transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, metabolomic analyses combined determine role pregnane X receptor (PXR) nongenotoxic signaling energy homeostasis liver rats repeatedly orally dosed PXR agonist pregnenolone carbonitrile (PCN) 7 days. Analyses mRNAs proteins supernatant, membrane, cytosolic fractions enlarged liver homogenates showed diverse expression profiles. Gene set enrichment analysis showed synchronous increase mRNAs proteins involved chemical carcinogenesis response drug possibly mediated PXR pathway proteasome core complex assembly possibly mediated Nrf2 pathway. addition, levels proteins endoplasmic reticulum lumen involved acute-phase response showed specific increase change mRNA level, composed mitochondrial inner membrane showed specific decrease. analysis phosphorylated peptides poly(A) RNA binding proteins showed decrease phosphorylation, possibly casein kinase 2, may related regulation protein expression. Proteins involved insulin signaling pathways showed increase phosphorylation, possibly protein kinase A, involved apoptosis showed decrease. Metabolomic analysis suggested activation pentose phosphate anaerobic glycolysis pathways increase amino acid fatty acid levels, occurs Warburg effect. conclusion, results combined analyses suggest PXR's effects due transcriptional post-transcriptional regulation alteration nongenotoxic signaling pathways energy homeostasis.
