 difficult make retrospective diagnosis perinatal asphyxia symptomatic neonates delivered non-institutionally. studied serum creatine kinase muscle-brain fraction (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) differentiating asphyxiated (n=25) non-asphyxiated (n=20) neonates present non-specific signs sickness. CK-MB assayed 8 24 h; LDH, SGOT SGPT 72 h life. comparing cases controls, median 8-hr CK-MB [80 U/L vs. 26 U/L respectively, P< 0.001], median 24-hr CK-MB [33.5 U/L vs. 21.5 U/L respectively, P=0.009] median LDH [965 U/L vs. 168 U/L respectively, P< 0.001] higher asphyxiated neonates. Raised LDH 100% sensitivity, CK-MB 100% specificity asphyxia. LDH highest area ROC curve (0.998). conclude LDH 72 hr life accurate differentiating asphyxiated non-asphyxiated symptomatic neonates.
