 Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) widespread neuropeptide acting neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, neurotrophic factor. diverse biological actions provide background variety deficits observed mice lacking endogenous PACAP. PACAP-deficient mice display several abnormalities, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)-like phenotype, decreased cell protection, increased risk Parkinson's disease. However, molecular proteomic background still unclear. Therefore, aim investigate differences peptide protein composition brains PACAP-deficient wild-type mice using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) mass spectrometric (MS)-based proteomic analysis. Brains PACAP-deficient mice removed, different brain areas (cortex, hippocampus, diencephalon, mesencephalon, brainstem, cerebellum) separated. Brain pieces weighed, homogenized, processed electrophoretic analysis. results revealed several differences diencephalon mesencephalon. protein bands interest cut gel, samples digested trypsin, tryptic peptides measured matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time flight (MALDI TOF) MS. Results analyzed MASCOT Search Engine. Among altered proteins, several involved metabolic processes, energy homeostasis, structural integrity. ATP-synthase tubulin beta-2A expressed strongly PACAP-knockout mice. contrast, expression peptides/proteins markedly decreased knockout mice, like pyruvate kinase, fructose biphosphate aldolase-A, glutathione S-transferase, peptidyl propyl cis-trans isomerase-A, gamma enolase, aspartate amino transferase. altered expression enzymes might partially account decreased antioxidant detoxifying capacity PACAP-deficient mice accompanying increased vulnerability animals. results provide novel insight altered biochemical processes mice lacking endogenous PACAP.
