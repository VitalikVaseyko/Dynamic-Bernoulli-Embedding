 fluorescent analogue GDP, 3'-O-anthraniloyl-GDP (anl-GDP) demonstrated bind elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) affinity even higher parent nucleotide. consequence binding, increase fluorescence anisotropy emission band arising non-radiative energy transfer among protein intrinsic fluorophores labelled nucleotide observed. Therefore, possible study exchange kinetics equilibrium protein-bound labelled GDP natural nucleotide modifications, occurring course reaction, fluorescence anisotropy non-radiative energy transfer. way, also easily proven that, presence aurodox (N-methylkirromycin), antibiotic impairing EF-Tu biological function, exchange kinetics protein-bound labeled GDP natural nucleotide faster. Moreover, also found labelled nucleotide recognized substrate pyruvate kinase, converted enzyme, presence phosphoenolpyruvate, anl-GTP. Pyruvate kinase also able convert, presence phosphoenolpyruvate, complex EF-Tu.anl-GDP complex EF-Tu.anl-GTP. fluorescence properties 3'-O-anthraniloyl-labeled guanyl nucleotides feature excellent acceptors fluorescence arising protein intrinsic fluorophores, may make compounds useful structural binding studies guanosine-nucleotide-binding proteins.
