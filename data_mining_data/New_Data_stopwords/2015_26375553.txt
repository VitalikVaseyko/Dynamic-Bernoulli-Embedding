 Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) constitutes one subtypes ovarian cancers, unique clinical, histological biological characteristics, one chemo-resistance. also known develop endometriotic cyst, benign ovarian tumor, relatively high frequency. Recently, becoming well known OCCCs express HNF1beta, transcription factor, closely associated development liver, pancreas kidney, well occurrence familial forms type 2 diabetes. Expression HNF1beta regarded hallmark tumor. Nevertheless, exact biological function gene OCCC clarified. shown previous studies microenvironment endometriotic cysts contains severe oxidative stress OCCC develops stressful environment stress-resistant tumor, may lead chemo-resistance. also showed increased expression HNF1beta facilitates glucose uptake glycolysis, known Warburg effect. previous issue journal, using comprehensive metabolome analysis, report HNF1beta actually reduces protects internal oxidative stress dramatically changing cellular metabolism. article, review relevance significance cancer-specific metabolism associated biological characteristics OCCC via expression HNF1beta, along future clinical implications targeting cancer-specific metabolism.
