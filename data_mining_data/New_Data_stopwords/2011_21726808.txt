 Protein acetylation emerged major mechanism regulating cellular metabolism. Whereas glycolytic steps reversible, reaction catalyzed pyruvate kinase irreversible, reverse reaction requires phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK1) commit gluconeogenesis. Here, show acetylation regulates stability gluconeogenic rate-limiting enzyme PEPCK1, thereby modulating cellular response glucose. High glucose destabilizes PEPCK1 stimulating acetylation. PEPCK1 acetylated P300 acetyltransferase, acetylation stimulates interaction PEPCK1 UBR5, HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, therefore promoting PEPCK1 ubiquitinylation degradation. Conversely, SIRT2 deacetylates stabilizes PEPCK1. observations represent example acetylation targets metabolic enzyme specific E3 ligase response metabolic condition changes. Given increased levels PEPCK linked type II diabetes, study also identifies potential therapeutic targets diabetes.
