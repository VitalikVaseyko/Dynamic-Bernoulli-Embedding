 Cultured hepatocytes derived adult rats used determine consequences altered poly(ADP-ribose)-metabolism DNA repair expression hepatocellular functions vitro. Inhibition poly(ADP-ribose)-biosynthesis affected process DNA repair response carcinogens one single step. expression two fetal enzymes, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase K-(111) type isozyme pyruvate kinase, inhibited hepatocytes poly(ADP-ribose)-biosynthesis suppressed 3-aminobenzamide inhibitors. data show cellular functions diverse DNA repair gene expression affected experimental manipulations poly(ADP-ribose)-metabolism cell. suggests poly(ADP-ribose)-modification chromatin proteins affects mechanism involved regulation one chromatin function.
