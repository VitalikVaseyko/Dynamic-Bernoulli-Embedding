 Methyl jasmonate recently found anti-cancer activity. Methyl jasmonate detached hexokinase 2 voltage dependent anion channel causing reduction mitochondrial transmembrane potential led release cytochrome C apoptosis inducing factor resulting intrinsic apoptosis. Blocked adenosine triphosphate synthesis caused mitochondrial injury hampered oxidative phosphorylation led cell necrosis. results applied vivo treatment nude mice satisfactory effect. Collectively, results suggest methyl jasmonate may adjuvant therapy liver tumors due mechanism cancer cells compared normal cells: major function inhibit glycolysis instead changing aerobic metabolism.
