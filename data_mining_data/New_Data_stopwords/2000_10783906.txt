 Since nitric oxide (NO) many cells involved energy metabolism, aim study evaluate role isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), donor, energy metabolism rat reticulocytes, particularly due high content hemoglobin--an effective scavenger NO. Rat reticulocyte-rich red blood cell suspensions aerobically incubated absence (control) presence different concentrations ISDN. ISDN decreased total coupled oxygen consumption (p<0.05) increased uncoupled oxygen consumption (p<0.05) dose- time-dependent manner. followed enhancement glycolysis, measured increased glucose consumption lactate accumulation (p<0.05). Levels glycolytic intermediates presence ISDN indicate stimulation pyruvate kinase activity. ISDN alter concentration ATP, increased ADP AMP levels (p>0.05). rat reticulocytes steady-state conditions, 95.4% overall energy produced oxidative phosphorylation 4.6% glycolysis. Due reduced coupled oxygen consumption presence ISDN, ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation significantly diminished. simultaneous increase glycolytic ATP production enough ensure constant ATP production. calculated mean ATP turnover time prolonged 199% presence 1.5 mmol/l ISDN. conclusion, ISDN a) inhibited total coupled respiration enhanced uncoupled respiration, b) stimulated glycolysis, c) decreased ATP production d) prolonged ATP turnover time rat reticulocytes. effects mediated effector molecule.
