 BACKGROUND: PPARs (alpha,gamma,delta) family ligand-activated transcription factors regulate energy balance, including lipid metabolism. Despite critical functions, integration specific pathways lipid metabolism distinct PPAR responses remains obscure. Previous work revealed lipolytic pathways activate PPARs. Whether hepatic lipase (HL), enzyme regulates VLDL HDL catabolism, participates PPAR responses unknown. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using PPAR ligand binding domain transactivation assays, found HL interacted triglyceride-rich VLDL (>HDL>>LDL, IDL) activate PPARdelta preferentially PPARalpha PPARgamma, effect dependent HL catalytic activity. cell free ligand displacement assays, VLDL hydrolysis HL activated PPARdelta VLDL-concentration dependent manner. Extended further, VLDL stimulation HL-expressing HUVECs FAO hepatoma cells increased mRNA expression canonical PPARdelta target genes, including adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP), angiopoietin like protein 4 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4. HL/VLDL regulated ADRP PPRE promoter region gene. vivo, adenoviral-mediated hepatic HL expression C57BL/6 mice increased hepatic ADRP mRNA levels 30%. ob/ob mice, model higher triglycerides C57BL/6 mice, HL overexpression increased ADRP expression 70%, demonstrating importance triglyceride substrate HL-mediated PPARdelta activation. Global metabolite profiling identified HL/VLDL released fatty acids including oleic acid palmitoleic acid capable recapitulating PPARdelta activation ADRP gene regulation vitro. CONCLUSIONS: data define novel pathway involving HL hydrolysis VLDL activates PPARdelta generation specific monounsaturated fatty acids. data also demonstrate integrating cell biology metabolomic approaches provides insight specific lipid mediators pathways lipid metabolism regulate transcription.
