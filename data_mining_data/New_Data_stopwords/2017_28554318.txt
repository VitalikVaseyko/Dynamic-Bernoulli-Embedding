 BACKGROUND: VDAC (Voltage-Dependent Anion selective Channel) small family abundant pore-forming proteins located outer mitochondrial membrane. role range intuitive, formation hydrophilic conduit membrane thanks beta-barrel structure, less understood functions make essential actors cross-talk bioenergetics metabolism cytosol components. Due localization, VDAC1, particular, reported involved apoptosis, Hexokinase tubulin binding, Warburg effect. reasons, involvement VDAC cancer considered consequential number compounds proposed used experimental trials demonstrate efficacy molecules affecting functions VDAC. OBJECTIVES: work, thus survey literature describing drug compounds acting cancerous proliferation VDAC. Three main categories assigned: molecules acting VDAC-Hexokinase binding, molecules directly inhibiting VDAC conductance, molecules affecting expression levels VDAC gene. application biological peptides purpose also considered. CONCLUSION: Since knowledges functional properties VDAC protein still insufficient, VDAC pharmacological target fight cancer still open, promising, field.
