 becoming increasingly clear microbiota inhabiting bodies influence cancer predisposition etiology. addition pathogens oncogenic properties, commensal symbiotic microbiota tumor-suppressive properties. Diet environmental factors modulate abundance certain members microbial communities within gastrointestinal tract anatomical sites. Furthermore, dietary factors metabolized commensal/symbiotic gut microbiota bioactive food components believed prevent cancer. example, dietary fiber undergoes bacterial fermentation colon yield butyrate, short-chain fatty acid histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suppresses viability growth colorectal cancer cell lines. recent study using gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates fiber protect colorectal tumorigenesis microbiota- butyrate-dependent manner involves Warburg effect. examples suggest inter-individual variation observed epidemiology intervention studies investigated associations diet cancer risk might explained differences microbiota among participants. Data basic research studies also support idea probiotics prebiotics could plausible chemoprevention strategies may utilized greater extent future.
