 1. effects different alternative starve-feed cycles glycolysis isolated renal tubules well glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase studied. Adaptive responses renal glycolysis nutritional conditions mentioned reported. 2. Renal glucose utilization increased linear fashion feeding state nutritional cycles, becoming twice much feeding fasting cycles. Conversely, decrease metabolic pathway took place starve periods cycles. feed-starve cycle decrease reached 70% 48 hr fasting fed high carbohydrate diet. Whereas opposite cycle almost 35%. 3. activities renal glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase parallel glycolytic capacity renal tubules different nutritional conditions. changes occur cellular substrate concentration. 4. behaviour kinetic parameters enzymes throughout experimental conditions reported. general, variations Km values without changes Vmax values take place reflect increase catalytic efficiency glycolytic enzymes feeding state conversely decrease starvation state.
