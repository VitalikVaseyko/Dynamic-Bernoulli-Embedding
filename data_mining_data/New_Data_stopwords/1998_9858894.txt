 interaction glycolysis, glutaminolysis tumor growth WAG/Fra rnu/rnu rats investigated. Small tumors characterized low conversion glucose lactate whereas conversion glutamine lactate high. medium sized tumors flow glucose lactate well oxygen utilization increased whereas glutamine serine consumption reduced. stage tumor cells start glutamate alanine production. Large tumors characterized low oxygen glucose supply high glucose oxygen utilization rate. conversion glucose glycine, alanine, glutamate, glutamine, proline reaches high values amino acids released. Pyruvate kinase increases tumor weight positively correlated increase glucose oxygen utilization. shift glutamate consumption glutamate production correlated increase glutamate dehydrogenase glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase activity.
