 effects short-term exposure NO2 glycolytic enzymes rat red cells examined. Exposure 10 ppm NO2 resulted decrease activities pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) day 1 increased progressively. Exposure 4 ppm NO2 caused progressive increases enzyme activities first day. day 5, PK PFK activities exposed animals became higher controls followed decreasing control level day 10. Red blood cells fractionated according ages. specific activities PK PFK decreased red cells became older. 7-day exposure 4 ppm NO2 resulted elevation PK PFK activities red cell subfractions. addition, amount youngest cells decreased concomitant increases older cells. findings suggest NO2 inhalation enhances red cell turnover.
