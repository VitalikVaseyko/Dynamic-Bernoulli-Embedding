 Hyperthyroidism [produced administration 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) 3 days adult rats] increased PDH kinase activities freshly isolated cardiomyocytes 1.6-fold. effects hyperthyroidism 48 h-starvation increase PDH kinase activities additive. Culture cardiomyocytes prepared fed, euthyroid rats 25 h T3 (100 nM) increased PDH kinase activities values comparable magnitude observed response experimental hyperthyroidism vivo. PDH kinase activities cardiomyocytes fed, euthyroid rats culture n-octanoate (1 mM) dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP)(50 microM) exceeded freshly isolated myocytes. DBcAMP T3 without effect presence n-octanoate. inclusion insulin (100 microU/ml) alone culture medium affect PDH kinase activity, insulin suppressed effects T3, DBcAMP n-octanoate increase cardiomyocyte PDH kinase activity culture. PDH kinase activities cardiomyocytes isolated starved rats declined 25 h culture. decline prevented inclusion T3, DBcAMP, culture medium. Insulin (100 microU/ml) suppressed effects T3 oppose loss cardiomyocyte PDH kinase activity experienced culture. results demonstrate hyperthyroidism leads stable increase activity cardiomyocyte PDH kinase, response mimicked T3 vitro. Insulin opposes effects T3 (and fatty acids cyclic AMP) increase PDH kinase activity cultured cardiomyocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
