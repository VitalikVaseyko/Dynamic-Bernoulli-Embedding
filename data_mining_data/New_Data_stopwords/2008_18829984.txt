 aim work investigate effect decreased cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber metabolism. Transgenic potato plants strongly reduced levels PKc generated RNA interference gene silencing control tuber-specific promoter. Metabolite profiling showed decreased PKc activity led decrease levels pyruvate organic acids involved tricarboxylic acid cycle. Flux analysis showed accompanied changes carbon partitioning, carbon flux diverted glycolysis toward starch synthesis. However, metabolic shift relatively small hence result enhanced starch levels tubers. Although total respiration rates ATP ADP ratio largely unchanged, transgenic tubers showed strong decrease levels alternative oxidase (AOX) protein corresponding decrease capacity alternative pathway respiration. External feeding pyruvate tuber tissue isolated mitochondria resulted activation AOX pathway, wild type PKc transgenic lines, providing direct evidence regulation AOX changes pyruvate levels. Overall, results provide evidence crucial role PKc regulation pyruvate levels well level AOX heterotrophic plant tissue, furthermore reveal parameters interlinked vivo.
