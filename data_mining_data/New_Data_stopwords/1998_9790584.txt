 Cantharidin calyculin A, natural toxins inhibitors protein phosphatases 1 2A (PPI PP2A, respectively). inhibit Neurospora crassa hyphal growth. N. crassa grown presence either drug, abnormalities observed hyphal tips. addition, drugs induced increase hyphal branching. Cantharidin inhibited N. crassa hyphal growth temperature-dependent manner, effect drug pronounced 34 degrees C 25 degrees C. addition drug-mediated inhibition phosphatase activity, genetic approach used determine phenotypic consequences reduced PP2A activity. Two strains subnormal PP2A activity constructed. first, original pph-1 gene (encoding PP2A catalytic subunit) replaced ectopically integrated copy pph-1, exhibited lower levels pph-1 transcript, lower PP2A activity increased sensitivity cantharidin. Similarly, second strain, pph-1 gene cloned antisense orientation downstream inducible isocitrate lyase promoter, lower levels pph-1 transcript, well PP2A activity, reduction hyphal growth observed. results study indicate PP2A, probably Ser/Thr phosphatases, involved regulation hyphal growth N. crassa.
