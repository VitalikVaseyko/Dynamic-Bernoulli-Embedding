 Cancer cells typically display altered glucose metabolism characterized preference aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect, facilitates cell proliferation. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) oncoprotein Myc two prominent transcription factors drive glycolysis. Previously, reported estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) act cofactors HIF enhance HIF-dependent transcription glycolytic genes hypoxia. ERRs orphan nuclear receptors key regulators energy metabolism orchestrating mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) oxidative phosphorylation. Here, show ERRs also stimulate glycolysis normoxia. ERRs directly bind activate promoters many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, ERR-binding sites promoters essential ERR-mediated transcriptional activation. ERRs interact Myc, two factors synergistically activate transcription glycolytic genes. Furthermore, overexpression ERRs increases glycolytic gene expression lactate production. Conversely, depletion ERRs cancer cells reduces expression glycolytic genes glucose uptake, resulting decreased aerobic glycolysis cell growth. Taken together, results suggest ERRs important transcriptional activators glycolytic pathway contribute Warburg effect cancer cells.
