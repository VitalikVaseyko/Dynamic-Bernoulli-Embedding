 Diabetes risk factor breast cancer development associated poor prognosis breast cancer patients. However, molecular biochemical mechanisms underlying association diabetes breast cancer fully elucidated. Here, investigated estradiol response MCF-7 breast cancer cells without chronic exposure insulin. found insulin priming necessary specific estradiol-induced cancer cell growth, induces anaplerotic shunting glucose macromolecule biosynthesis estradiol treated cells. Treatment ERK Akt specific inhibitors, U0126 LY294002, respectively, suppressed estradiol-induced growth. Interestingly, molecular analysis revealed estradiol treatment markedly increases expression cyclin B, decreases p21 p27 insulin-primed cells. addition, estradiol treatment activated metabolic genes pentose phosphate (PPP) serine biosynthesis pathways insulin-primed cells insulin priming decreased metabolic gene expression associated glucose catabolism breast cancer cells. Finally, found anti-diabetic drug metformin AMPK ligand AICAR, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), specifically suppress estradiol-induced cellular growth insulin-primed cells. findings suggest estrogen receptor (ER) activation chronic hyperinsulinemic condition increases breast cancer growth modulation cell cycle apoptotic factors nutrient metabolism, provide mechanistic evidence clinical benefit metformin use ER-positive breast cancer patients diabetes.
