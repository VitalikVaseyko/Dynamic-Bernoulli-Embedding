 PURPOSE: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-5) major lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme catalyzing transformation pyruvate lactate anaerobic acquisition energy. study, expression LDH-5 assessed normal malignant endometrium. role prognosis tumor angiogenesis hypoxia also examined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tissue specimens 68 patients clinical stage endometrial adenocarcinoma endometrioid cell type 20 samples normally cycling endometrium investigated immunohistochemically expression LDH-5. vascular density expression angiogenesis/hypoxia-related proteins (VEGF, HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha, phosphorylated VEGFR2/KDR, VEGF/KDR complex) also assessed. RESULTS: Unlike normal epithelia, glandular endometrial cells consistently expressed LDH-5 suggesting role enzyme normal menstrual cycle. Endometrial adenocarcinomas displayed LDH-5 expression 31/68 (45.5%) cases high LDH-5 expression connected low lymphocytic response; may suggest important role LDH-5 and, presumably, lactate release tumor escape host immuno-surveillance. importantly, LDH-5 significantly associated expression phosphorylated VEGFR2/KDR receptors cancer cells tumor-associated vasculature. LDH-5 one powerful independent prognostic variables. CONCLUSIONS: LDH-5 expression independent prognostic marker endometrial cancer, linked impaired host immune response activation VEGFR2/KDR receptors cancer cells tumor-associated vasculature. Adjuvant radio-chemotherapy may, therefore, useful cases, administration VEGF- tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors emerges therapeutic option.
