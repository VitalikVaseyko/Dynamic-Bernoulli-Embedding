 1. Vmax. activity pyruvate kinase sheep adipose tissue increased tissue culture 48 h; increase blocked actinomycin (an inhibitor transcription) promoted insulin antagonized dexamethasone. 2. contrast effects pyruvate kinase, insulin dexamethasone acted synergistically increase activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase sheep adipose tissue maintained culture. 3. Insulin stimulated, whereas dexamethasone inhibited, glucose utilization sheep adipose tissue maintained culture; two agents mutually antagonistic, effects prevented actinomycin D. 4. Antimycin (an inhibitor electron-transport chain) stimulated glucose uptake lactate output sheep adipose tissue presence dexamethasone insulin, suggesting effects dexamethasone glucose utilization sheep adipose tissue due inhibition glucose transport. 5. Comparison findings previous studies endocrine control hepatic pyruvate kinase shows major differences control Vmax. activities liver adipose tissue. 6. Although glucocorticoid hormones inhibit glucose utilization antagonize stimulatory effects insulin glucose utilization adipose tissue sheep rats, appear major differences sites action hormones two species.
