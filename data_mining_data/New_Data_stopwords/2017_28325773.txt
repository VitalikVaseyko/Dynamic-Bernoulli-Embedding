 Cancer progression depends cellular metabolic reprogramming direct indirect consequence oncogenic lesions; however, underlying mechanisms still poorly understood. Here, report CUEDC2 (CUE domain-containing protein 2) plays vital role facilitating aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, cancer cells. Mechanistically, show CUEDC2 upregulates two key glycolytic proteins GLUT3 LDHA via interacting glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 14-3-3zeta, respectively. demonstrate enhanced aerobic glycolysis essential role CUEDC2 drive cancer progression. Moreover, using tissue microarray analysis, show correlation aberrant expression CUEDC2, GLUT3 LDHA clinical HCC samples, demonstrating link CUEDC2 Warburg effect cancer development. Taken together, findings reveal previously unappreciated function CUEDC2 cancer cell metabolism tumorigenesis, illustrating close oncogenic lesions intertwined metabolic alterations promoting cancer progression.
