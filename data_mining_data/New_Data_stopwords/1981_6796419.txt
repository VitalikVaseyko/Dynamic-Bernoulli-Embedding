 Changes glucose metabolism rats feeding 3-methyl-4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene (3'-Me-DAB) investigated radiorespirometry 14C-labelled carbohydrates substrates, relation levels liver glycolytic enzyme activities. Rats fed 0.06% 3'-Me-DAB 7 weeks. Radiorespirometry carried IP administration [U-14C] glucose 2.5 micro Ci [1-14C] acetate 2.0 micro Ci weekly experimental period. analysis radiorespirometric pattern obtained [U-14C]glucose, peak time (PT) markedly shortened week 4. week 6 3'-Me-DAB feeding, peak height (PH) yield value (YV) increased significantly concomitant shortening PT. duration activation radiorespirometric parameters paralleled reasonably well glycolytic enzyme activity; activation liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) shortens PT, activation tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle increases YV. study showed radiorespirometric pattern reflected glucose metabolism liver well. conclusion, radiorespirometric analysis 14C-labelled glucose substrate may useful clinical diagnosis liver diseases.
