 Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), recently shown promising nontoxic antineoplastic agent. study, demonstrated DCA could induce autophagy LoVo cells, confirmed formation autophagosomes, appearance punctate patterns LC3 immunoreactivity activation autophagy associated proteins. Moreover, autophagy inhibition 3-methyladenine (3-MA) Atg7 siRNA treatment significantly enhance DCA-induced apoptosis. determine underlying mechanism DCA-induced autophagy, target identification using drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) coupled ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis utilized profile differentially expressed proteins control DCA-treated LoVo cells. result, Cathepsin (CTSD) thioredoxin-like protein 1 (TXNL1) identified significant alterations compared control. study indicated DCA treatment significantly promoted abnormal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. hand, DCA-triggered autophagy could attenuated N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), ROS inhibitor. Finally, demonstrated Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, major negative regulator autophagy, suppressed DCA treatment. knowledge, first study show DCA induced protective autophagy LoVo cells, potential mechanisms involved ROS imbalance Akt-mTOR signaling pathway suppression.
