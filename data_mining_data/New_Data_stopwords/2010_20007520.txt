 Chronic hypoxia reduces aerobic capacity (mitochondrial content) limb skeletal muscles, one causes seems decreased physical activity. Diaphragm respiratory muscles, however, may different pattern adaptation hypoxia increases work breathing. Thus, hypothesized chronic hypoxia would reduce mitochondrial content mouse diaphragm. Adult male C57BL/6J mice kept normoxia (Fi(O(2)) = 21%, control) normobaric hypoxia (Fi(O(2)) = 10%, hypoxia) 1, 2, 4 wk. Mice killed, diaphragm gastrocnemius muscles collected analysis. diaphragm, cytochrome c oxidase histochemistry showed less intense staining hypoxia group. total content subunits electron transport chain, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) evaluated Western blot. proteins decreased 25-30% 4 wk hypoxia (P < 0.05 vs. control comparisons), matching comparable decrease diaphragmatic mitochondrial volume density (control 33.6 +/- 5.5% vs. hypoxia 26.8 +/- 6.7%, P = 0.013). Mitochondrial volume density protein content change gastrocnemius hypoxia. Hypoxia decreased content peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) PPARgamma cofactor 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha) diaphragm gastrocnemius. PGC-1alpha mRNA levels diaphragm also reduced hypoxia. BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3 (BNIP-3) mRNA levels upregulated 1 2 wk hypoxia diaphragm gastrocnemius, respectively; BNIP-3 protein content increased diaphragm 4 wk hypoxia. Contrary hypothesis, results show chronic hypoxia decreases mitochondrial content mouse diaphragm, despite increase workload. combination reduced mitochondrial biogenesis increased mitophagy seems responsible decrease mitochondrial content mouse diaphragm hypoxia.
