 BACKGROUND: gastrointestinal tumors, subunits pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 detectable, mainly dimeric form termed tumor M2-PK. rapid test detection M2-PK stool developed. evaluated performance M2-PK rapid kit detection colorectal tumors compared colonoscopy DESIGN: Stool specimens (n=268) obtained patients fecal occult blood test colonoscopy performed clinical evaluation routine health checkup. Collected stool specimens kept frozen -20 degrees C testing. fecal tumor M2-PK test performed using ScheBo M2-PK Quick test (ScheBo((R))*Biotech AG, Giessen, Germany) RESULTS: total 236 patients analyzed, including 87 tubular adenoma 126 controls. tumor M2-PK testing, 37 87 tubular adenoma specimens (42.5%) 2 4 sessile serrated adenoma specimens (50%) tested positive. specificity M2-PK rapid test 87.3% CONCLUSIONS: tumor M2-PK test demonstrated moderate sensitivity detection colorectal adenoma. M2-PK test could considered useful point-of-care testing device detection colorectal tumors.
