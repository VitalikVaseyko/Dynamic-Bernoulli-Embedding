 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key glycolytic enzyme regulates Warburg effect necessary tumor growth. However, role chemoresistance fully elucidated. METHODS: PKM2 expression examined immunohistochemistry 205 tissue samples thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients undergone curative surgery (100 patients surgery alone 105 patients preoperative chemotherapy). relationship PKM2 expression clinicopathological factors, including chemotherapy response examined. vitro assays performed determine mechanism PKM2-related chemoresistance, using esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. RESULTS: PKM2 expression significantly correlated tumor cell differentiation, tumor depth, tumor stage. Strong PKM2 expression significantly correlated decreased survival rates poor response chemotherapy. vitro assays showed PKM2 inhibition significantly decreased cisplatin resistance increased apoptosis. siPKM2-transfected cells, pyruvate kinase activity paradoxically increased, followed increased intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. ratio NADPH/NADP, indicator glucose influx pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), significantly decreased siPKM2-transfected cells upon cisplatin treatment compared control cells. CONCLUSIONS: PKM2 expression associated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma chemoresistance. PKM2 inhibition restore cisplatin sensitivity inactivating PPP.
