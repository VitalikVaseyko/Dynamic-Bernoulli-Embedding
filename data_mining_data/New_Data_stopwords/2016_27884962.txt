 rather new approach treatment long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders represented triheptanoin, triglyceride three medium-odd-chain heptanoic acids (C7), due anaplerotic potential. investigate effects 1-year triheptanoin-based diet clinical phenotype long-chain-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase-deficient (VLCAD(-/-)) mice. cardiac function assessed VLCAD(-/-) mice vivo MRI. Metabolic adaptations identified expression genes regulating energy metabolism anaplerotic processes using real-time PCR, results correlated measurement glycolytic enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. Finally, intrahepatic lipid accumulation oxidative stress response long-term triheptanoin diet assessed. Triheptanoin able prevent development systolic dysfunction VLCAD(-/-) mice despite upregulation cardiac glucose oxidation. Strikingly, anaplerotic effects triheptanoin restricted liver. Despite this, hepatic lipic content increased upon triheptanoin supplementation. data demonstrate concept anaplerosis apply tissues equally.
