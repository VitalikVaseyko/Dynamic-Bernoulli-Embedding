 Improvement nutrient use efficiency cereal crops highly essential reduce cost cultivation also save environmental pollution, reduce energy consumption production chemical fertilizers, improve soil health, ultimately help mitigating climate change. present investigation, studied morphological (with special emphasis root system architecture) biochemical responses (in terms assay key enzymes involved N assimilation) two N-responsive wheat genotypes, seedling stage, nitrate-optimum nitrate-starved conditions grown hydroponics. Expression profile known wheat micro RNAs (miRNAs) also studied root tissue. Total root size, primary root length, first- second-order lateral root numbers responded significantly nitrate-starved condition. Morphological parameters terms root shoot length fresh dry weight roots shoots also observed significant N-optimum N-starved condition genotypes. Nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthatase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity significantly decreased N-starved condition. Glutamine oxoglutarate amino transferase (GOGAT) pyruvate kinase (PK) activity found genotype dependent. selected miRNAs expressed root tissues, showed differential N-responsive expression. studies indicate one N-responsive genotype (NP-890) get affected significantly nitrogen starvation seedling stage.
