 rat liver perfused situ stimulation nerve plexus around hepatic artery portal vein caused increase glucose output shift lactate uptake output. effects nerve stimulation key enzymes, metabolites effectors carbohydrate metabolism determined compared actions glucagon, led increase glucose output also lactate uptake. 1. Nerve stimulation caused enhancement activity glycogen phosphorylase 300% decrease activity glycogen synthase 40%, left activity pyruvate kinase unaltered. Glucagon, similarly nerve action, led strong increase glycogen phosphorylase decrease glycogen synthase; yet contrast nerve effect lowered pyruvate kinase activity clearly. 2. Nerve stimulation increased levels glucose 6-phosphate fructose 6-phosphate 200% 170%, respectively; glucagon enhanced levels 400% 230%, respectively. levels ATP ADP altered, AMP increased slightly nerve stimulation. 3. Nerve stimulation enhanced levels effectors fructose 2,6-bisphosphate cyclic AMP slightly 140% 125%, respectively; glucagon lowered level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate 15% increased level cyclic AMP 300%. 4. calcium-free perfusions metabolic responses nerve stimulation showed normal kinetics, calcium re-added 3 min before, delayed kinetics, re-added 2 min onset stimulus. delay may due time required refill intracellular calcium stores. hemodynamic alterations dependent extracellular calcium normal cases. activation glycogen phosphorylase, inhibition glycogen synthase increase glucose 6-phosphate well explain enhancement glucose output following nerve stimulation. unaltered activity pyruvate kinase marginal increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate cannot cause nerve-stimulation-dependent shift lactate uptake output. slight increase level cyclic AMP nerve stimulation cannot elicit observed activation glycogen phosphorylase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
