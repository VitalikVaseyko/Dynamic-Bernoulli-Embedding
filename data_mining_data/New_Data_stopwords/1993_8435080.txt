 Treatment 18 h-starved rats dexamethasone subsequent isolation incubation hepatocytes presence steroid increased gluconeogenic flux 1.0 mM pyruvate 1.0 mM lactate plus 0.2 mM pyruvate substrate. magnitude stimulation comparable substrates. increase glucose output accompanied increased flux pyruvate carboxylase, although absolute flux magnitude considerably less presence reduced substrate. effect steroid flux pyruvate dehydrogenase substrate-dependent, inhibition occurring oxidized substrate. effect steroid treatment [1-14C]lactate pyruvate oxidation tricarboxylic-acid-cycle flux measured [3-14C]pyruvate oxidation. Dexamethasone treatment resulted parallel increase pyruvate kinase flux glucose synthesis substrates employed, indicating steroid effect partitioning phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate lactate formation gluconeogenesis. Similarly effect steroid either activity ratio total pyruvate kinase activity cells. suggested acute effect dexamethasone increase gluconeogenesis resides level phosphoenolpyruvate formation, i.e. pyruvate carboxylase possibly phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.
