 glucocorticoid insulin known anabolic effect lipogenesis. glycolytic pathway part lipogenic pathway liver, glycolytic enzymes mediate conversion glucose pyruvate, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) mediates conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA, activity regulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) phosphatases (PDPs). study, surveyed effects glucocorticoid, insulin, forskolin (used surrogate glucagon) transcriptional activity glucokinase (GK), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), liver-type pyruvate kinase (LPK), PDKs/PDPs isoform genes. found glucocorticoid insulin positive effects PFK1 LPK, whereas GK two hormones showed opposite effect. Regarding PDKs/PDPs, glucocorticoid significantly stimulated transcriptional activity PDKs, among effect PDK4 prominent. Insulin alone minimal effects PDKs, dampened positive effects glucocorticoid. PDPs, glucocorticoid forskolin showed negative effects, whereas insulin positive effects; insulin glucocorticoid/forskolin antagonized other. Altogether, data suggest glucocorticoid insulin lipogenic effects positive effects PFK1 LPK expression. However, glucocorticoid antagonizes effect insulin level GK maintain glucose homeostasis PDKs/PDPs facilitate gluconeogenesis. Glucagon may also enhance gluconeogenesis inhibiting PDPs.
