 isocitrate dehydrogenase Escherichia coli ML308 reversibly activated addition pyruvate cells growing acetate [Bennett & Holms (1975) J. Gen. Microbiol. 87, 37-51]. using cells pulse-labelled [32P]Pi showed activation inactivation enzyme conditions correlate dephosphorylation rephosphorylation respectively. Incubation cell extracts prepared activation/inactivation cycle purified isocitrate dehydrogenase phosphatase confirmed pyruvate-induced activation dehydrogenase goes essentially completion. results show reversible changes activity dehydrogenase cells grown acetate solely due phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Inactive 32P-labelled isocitrate dehydrogenase isolated cells incubated [32P]Pi presence acetate. material purified enzyme phosphorylated vitro digested chymotrypsin, phosphopeptides isolated analysed. one phosphopeptide observed case; results show residue phosphorylated vivo identical phosphorylated purified isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase vitro.
