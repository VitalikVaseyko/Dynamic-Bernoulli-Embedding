 Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) profound effects hepatic gene transcription leading significant changes lipid metabolism. PUFA rapidly suppress transcription genes encoding specific lipogenic glycolytic enzymes induce genes encoding specific peroxisomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Using peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha)-null mouse, showed dietary PUFA induction acyl CoA oxidase (AOX) CYP4A2 require PPAR alpha. However, PPAR alpha required PUFA-mediated suppression fatty acid synthase (FAS), S14, L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK). Studies primary rat hepatocytes cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed metabolites 20:4n-6, like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), suppress mRNA encoding FAS, S14, L-PK Gi/Go-coupled signal transduction cascade. contrast adipocytes, 20:4n-6-mediated suppression lipogenic gene expression hepatic parenchymal cells require cyclooxygenase. Transfection analysis S14CAT fusion genes primary hepatocytes shows peroxisome proliferator-activated PPAR alpha acts thyroid hormone response elements (-2.8/-2.5 kb). contrast, PGE2 20:4n-6 regulate factors act proximal promoter (-150/-80 bp) region, respectively. conclusion, PUFA affects hepatic gene transcription least three distinct mechanisms: (i) PPAR-dependent pathway, (ii) prostanoid pathway, (iii) PPAR prostanoid-independent pathway. PUFA regulation hepatic lipid metabolism involves integration multiple pathways.
