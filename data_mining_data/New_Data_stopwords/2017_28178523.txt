 Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) systems essential mitochondrial health normal cellular function. Dysfunction MQC emerging central mechanism pathogenesis various diseases, including Parkinson's disease. mammalian mitochondrial rhomboid protease, PARL, proposed regulator PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy, essential component MQC. PARL undergoes N-terminal autocatalytic cleavage (beta cleavage), required efficient mitophagy. demonstrate beta cleavage responds mitochondrial stress, triggered depletion mitochondrial ATP. Furthermore, show PDK2, key regulator metabolic plasticity, phosphorylates PARL regulates beta cleavage. regulating beta cleavage production less active enzyme, PACT, PDK2 negatively regulates PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy. Taken together, propose PDK2/PARL senses defects mitochondrial bioenergetics, integrating mitochondrial metabolism mitophagy MQC human health disease.
