 describe protocols fractionation isolated hepatocytes eight sub-populations using centrifugal elutriation. distribution fluorescein isothiocyanate acridine orange hepatocytes prepared livers pre-perfused one dyes described used indicator acinar zone derivation population. cytochrome P-450 content response induction 3-methylcholanthrene phenobarbitone; distribution lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, pyruvate kinase tyrosine aminotransferase activities sub-populations also reported. marked asymmetry distribution activities observed. basis putative zone derivations (based data fluorescent dye distribution) eight factors studied, distributions six consistent sub-populations derived different acinar zones. Two major discrepancies noted however, distribution pyruvate kinase activity response sub-populations phenobarbitone. conclude study metabolic heterogeneity revealed sub-populations generated, characterisation required determine whether acinar zone separation occurred extent.
