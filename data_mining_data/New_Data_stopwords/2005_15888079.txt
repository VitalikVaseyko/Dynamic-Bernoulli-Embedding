 malaria threat global health exacerbated widespread drug resistance Plasmodium parasite insect vector, lack efficacious vaccine. Infection Plasmodium parasites cause wide spectrum pathologies, transient mild form anaemia severe rapidly fatal cerebral disease. Epidemiological studies humans experiments animal models shown genetic factors play key role onset, progression, type disease developed ultimate outcome malaria. protective effect polymorphic variants erythrocyte-specific structural proteins metabolic enzymes blood-stage disease one clearest illustrations genetic modulation, suggested co-evolution Plasmodium parasite human host areas endemic disease. Here, present brief overview erythrocyte polymorphisms biological relevance malaria pathogenesis, current work mechanism(s) mediate protective effect. recent addition erythrocyte pyruvate kinase group protective genes also discussed.
