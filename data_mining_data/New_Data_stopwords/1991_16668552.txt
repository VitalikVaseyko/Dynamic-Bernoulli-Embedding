 Leucoplast pyruvate kinase (PK(p); EC 2.7.1.40) endosperm developing castor oil seeds (Ricinus communis L. cv Baker 296) appears highly susceptible limited degradation cysteine endopeptidase purification enzyme incubation clarified homogenates 4 degrees C. Purified castor seed PK(p) previously reported consist immunologically related 57.5 44 kilodalton subunits (Plaxton WC, Dennis DT, Knowles VL [1990] Plant Physiol 94: 1528-1534). contrast, immunoreactive polypeptides 63.5 54 kilodaltons observed western blot extract prepared denaturing conditions probed affinity purified rabbit anti-(castor seed PK(p)) immunoglobulin G. Proteolytic activity PK(p) estimated disappearance 63.5 54 kilodalton subunits concomitant appearance lower molecular mass immunoreactive degradation products incubation clarified homogenates 4 degrees C. presence 2 millimolar dithiothreitol accelerated degradation PK(p). conservation 63.5 54 kilodalton subunits observed extraction enzyme presence 1 millimolar p-hydroxymecuribenzoate, 1 millimolar Nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 10 millimolar iodoacetate. results reveal cysteine endopeptidase responsible vitro proteolysis PK(p). endopeptidase present throughout stages endosperm development. PK(p)-degrading activity, however, appears pronounced preparations older endosperm. lysates purified leucoplasts incubated 4 degrees C 21 hours, degradation PK(p) observed; indicated extra-leucoplastic localization cysteine endopeptidase. Although vivo subunit structure PK(p) remains uniform throughout stages endosperm development, large decrease PK activity accompanies castor seed maturation coincides marked reduction concentration PK(p).
