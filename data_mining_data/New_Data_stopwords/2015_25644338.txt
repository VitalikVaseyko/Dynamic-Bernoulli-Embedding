 BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies shown consumption whole grains reduce risk type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality. However, underlying mechanisms remain matter debate. OBJECTIVE: aimed determine effects wheat bran-derived alkylresorcinols diet-induced metabolic disorders mice. METHODS: fed C57BL/6J mice normal refined diet high-fat, high-sucrose diet [29.1% fat, 20.7% protein, 34.0% carbohydrates containing 20.0% sucrose (w/w)] alone (FS) containing 0.4% (wt:wt) alkylresorcinols (FS-AR) 10 wk. RESULTS: alkylresorcinols suppressed FS-induced increases body weight 31.0% well FS-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation (means +/- SEMs: 29.6 +/- 3.18 19.8 +/- 2.42 mg/g tissue FS FS-AR groups, respectively), without affecting energy intake. measured circadian changes blood metabolic hormones found FS-induced hyperinsulinemia (5.1 2.1 mug/L night FS FS-AR groups, respectively) hyperleptinemia (21.6 10.8 mug/L night FS FS-AR groups, respectively) suppressed alkylresorcinols. Glucose insulin tolerance tests showed alkylresorcinols significantly reduced fasting blood glucose concentrations (190 +/- 3.62 160 +/- 8.98 mg/dL FS FS-AR groups, respectively) suppressed glucose intolerance well insulin resistance induced FS diet. Furthermore, alkylresorcinols significantly increased insulin-stimulated hepatic serine/threonine protein kinase B phosphorylation compared FS diet (+81.3% +57.4% Ser473 Thr308, respectively). hand, pyruvate starch tolerance tests suggested alkylresorcinols affect gluconeogenesis carbohydrate digestion, respectively. Alkylresorcinols significantly increased fecal cholesterol excretion 39.6% reduced blood cholesterol concentrations 30.4%, upregulating expression hepatic cholesterol synthetic genes sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (Srebf2) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme synthase 1 (Hmgcs1). CONCLUSIONS: findings suggest wheat alkylresorcinols increase glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity suppressing hepatic lipid accumulation intestinal cholesterol absorption, subsequently suppresses diet-induced obesity mice.
