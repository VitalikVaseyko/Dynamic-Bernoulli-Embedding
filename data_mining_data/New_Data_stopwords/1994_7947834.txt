 Two-dimensional proton transfer nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (TRNOESY) studies conformations adenosine moieties nucleotides bound active site lobster (Homarus americanus) muscle arginine kinase reported. TRNOESY measurements made using sample protocol chosen minimize contributions weak non-specific binding nucleotides observed NOE's. done making measurements function ligand concentration keeping ligand enzyme concentration ratio fixed 10:1. experiments performed 500 MHz 10 degrees C six different mixing times range 40-300 ms. measurements made three complexes enzyme: E.MgATP, E.MgADP, long-lived transition-state-analog complex (E.MgADP.NO-3.arginine). complexes, including transition-state-analog complex estimated lifetime 50 ms, satisfy fast-exchange condition. TRNOE buildup curves nucleotide-proton pairs complex analyzed using complete relaxation matrix appropriate fast exchange. interproton distances obtained NOE analysis used constraints obtaining energy-minimized conformation basis program CHARMm. glycosidic torsion angle (chi) adenosine moiety three complexes 50 degrees +/- 5 degrees. glycosidic orientation agrees well determined MgATP MgADP complexes creatine kinase (Murali et al., 1993), MgATP bound active ancillary sites pyruvate kinase (Jarori et al., 1994a), PRPP synthetase (Jarori et al., 1994b).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
