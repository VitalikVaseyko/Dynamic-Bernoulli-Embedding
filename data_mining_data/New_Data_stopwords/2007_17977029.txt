 present results screening pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency cohort 146 patients pre-selected 4017 individuals hematological index analysis. average PK activity levels measured cohort study 1.9% IU/g Hb activity measured 85 healthy adults normal erythrocyte indexes range 3.9-9.8 IU/g Hb. able define 14 different mutations coding sequence R-PK gene 74 individuals low enzyme activity. common G1168A G1529A mutations exon 11 occurring 54% cases. mutations occurring C1492T, C1456T, G1291A, C1594T, G787A, G994A, G1010C. polymorphism nt 1705 linkage disequilibrium C polymorphism, indicated multi-centric origin mutation. study promoter region intron/exon boundary investigation.
