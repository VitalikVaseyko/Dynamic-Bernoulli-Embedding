 investigated expression profiles microRNA (miRNA) gastric carcinomas use miRNA microarray platform covering total 470 human miRNAs. identified 39 differentially expressed miRNAs gastric carcinoma, six significantly downregulated 33 upregulated. found miRNA-375 (miR-375) downregulated ectopic expression gastric carcinoma cells markedly reduced cell viability via caspase-mediated apoptosis pathway. Interestingly, found expression miR-375 inhibited expression PDK1, direct target miR-375, followed suppression Akt phosphorylation. analysis gene expression microarray revealed 14-3-3zeta, potent antiapoptotic gene, significantly downregulated mRNA protein levels cells transfected miR-375. activity luciferase reporter containing miR-375 binding sequence 3' untranslated region (UTR) 14-3-3zeta mRNA repressed ectopic expression miR-375, suggesting miR-375 targets 3' UTR 14-3-3zeta. addition, knockdown either PDK1 14-3-3zeta gastric carcinoma cells induced caspase activation, also observed miR-375-transfected cells, suggesting miR-375 may exert proapoptotic function, least part, downregulation PDK1 14-3-3zeta. Taken together, propose miR-375 candidate tumor suppressor miRNA gastric carcinoma.
