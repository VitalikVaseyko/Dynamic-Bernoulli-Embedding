 turnover protein prototrophic strain Bacillus stearothermophilus exponential growth salts medium glucose succinate carbon source 4 %/h richer nutrient broth medium 23 %/h. Protein degradation non-growing conditions conformed similar pattern. turnover RNA (non-messenger) 1 %/h salts medium 9 %/h nutrient broth. turnover protein RNA thermophile thus moderate rather massive. conclusion confirmed measurement decay specific enzyme, isocitrate lyase, prototroph overall protein turnover non-prototrophic strain B. stearothermophilus. half-lives number enzyme systems intact cells prototrophic thermophile optimum growth temperature showed variation indicated significant rate inactivation. decay protein vivo apparently accounts moderate protein turnover observed growth.
