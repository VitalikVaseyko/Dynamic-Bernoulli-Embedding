 Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria found majority arthropods filarial nematodes medical veterinary importance. evolved wide range symbiotic associations. filarial nematodes cause human lymphatic filariasis (Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi) onchocerciasis (Onchocerca volvulus), Wolbachia important parasite development, reproduction survival. symbiotic bacteria rely part nutrients energy sources provided host. Genomic analyses suggest strain Wolbachia found B. malayi (wBm) lacks genes two glycolytic enzymes--6-phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase--and thus potentially unable convert glucose pyruvate, important substrate energy generation. Wolbachia surface protein, wBm00432, complexed six B. malayi glycolytic enzymes, including aldolase. study characterized two B. malayi aldolase isozymes found expression dependent Wolbachia fitness number. confirmed immuno-transmission electron microscopy aldolase associated Wolbachia surface. RNAi experiments suggested aldolase-2 plays significant role Wolbachia survival embryogenesis B. malayi. Treatment doxycycline reduced Wolbachia fitness increased amount glucose glycogen detected filarial parasite, indicating glucose metabolism glycogen storage B. malayi associated Wolbachia fitness. metabolic co-dependency Wolbachia filarial nematode indicates glycolysis could shared metabolic pathway bacteria B. malayi, thus potential new target anti-filarial therapy.
