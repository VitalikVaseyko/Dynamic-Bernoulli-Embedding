 order elucidate regulatory mechanism blood glucose concentrations specific chickens, carbohydrate metabolism liver, muscle kidney metabolite concentrations blood investigated chickens acute persistent hypoglycemia. Acute persistent hypoglycemia experimentally induced single injection insulin (8 U/kg BW) continuous infusion insulin (22.5 U/kg BW/day) 4 days. Non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration plasma D-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) concentrations liver muscle increased acute hypoglycemia. Plasma NEFA concentration 3HB concentration blood liver changed day 3 persistent hypoglycemia, 3HB concentration muscle decreased. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity liver tended increase PFK pyruvate kinase (PK) activities unchanged acute hypoglycemia. persistent hypoglycemia, increase hepatic PFK activity day 1 reversed day 3, small increase muscle PK activity observed, PK phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities liver kidney significantly changed. results show persistent hypoglycemic chickens, hepatic glycolysis transiently increases, followed small decrease, glycolysis muscles gluconeogenesis liver kidney significantly changed.
