 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase (PK) plays major role regulation glycolysis. catalytic activity controlled substrate phosphoenolpyruvate one allosteric effectors. crystal structures non-allosteric PKs cat rabbit muscle known. determined three-dimensional structure allosteric type PK Escherichia coli, order study mechanism allosteric regulation. RESULTS: 2.5 resolution crystal structure unligated type PK inactive T-state shows subunit homotetrameric enzyme comprises (beta/alpha)8-barrel domain, flexible beta-barrel domain C-terminal domain. allosteric active sites located domain interfaces. Comparison T-state E. coli PK non-allosteric muscle enzyme, thought adopt conformation similar active R-state, reveals differences orientations beta-barrel C-terminal domains subunit, rotated 17 degrees 15 degrees, respectively. Moreover, relative orientation four subunits differs 16 degrees two enzymes. Highly conserved residues subunit interfaces couple movements conformational changes substrate allosteric effector binding sites. subunit rotations observed T-state PK induce shift loop 6 (beta/alpha)8-barrel domain, leading distortion phosphoenolpyruvate-binding site accounting low substrate affinity T-state enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: results suggest allosteric control PK accomplished remarkable domain subunit rotations. transition T- R-state 12 domains functional tetramer modify relative orientations. concerted motions molecular basis coupling active centre allosteric site.
