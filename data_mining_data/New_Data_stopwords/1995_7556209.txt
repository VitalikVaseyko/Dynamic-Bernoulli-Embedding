 Macromolecules restore morphological changes outer mitochondrial compartment occur upon isolation organelle. decrease volume intermembrane space increase number intermembrane contact sites. study, investigated effects macromolecules one processes occurring mitochondrial outer compartment native structure might important, i.e. ADP supply outer-membrane-bound hexokinase-I oxidative phosphorylation. use reconstituted system rat liver mitochondria extramitochondrial pyruvate kinase compete ADP generated hexokinase, shown (a) part ADP generated mitochondrially associated hexokinase accessible pyruvate kinase channeled mitochondrion, (b) presence 10% (mass/vol.) macromolecules (i.e. dextran M20 BSA) pyruvate kinase inaccessible fraction increases 19% 31% ADP produced hexokinase, (c) ADP channeling characteristic property bound hexokinase, (d) increased channeling induced macromolecules neither explained direct effects macromolecules basic respiratory properties rat liver mitochondria, direct effects kinetic properties hexokinase-I. ATP ADP determinations performed hexokinase/mitochondria incubation mixtures presence macromolecules. determinations showed important consequence channeling capacity bound hexokinase lower extramitochondrial ADP levels consequently higher extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios maintained hexokinase bound. experimental data demonstrate ADP channeling activity associated bound hexokinase leads formation two ADP concentration gradients, one across outer membrane one bound hexokinase bulk phase.
