 activities phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase examined liver function age Swiss albino mice. hepatic activity phosphofructokinase total pyruvate dehydrogenase peaked mice 8 12 weeks age decreased value remained stable mature animals older 24 weeks age. Yet, activity pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase active form liver remained unchanged mice 12 weeks age. mice matured, progressive increase activity pyruvate kinase active form pyruvate dehydrogenase liver observed phosphofructokinase unaltered. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, total activity proportion enzyme active form, epididymal fat pad mouse showed consistent age trend. observed increase activity pyruvate kinase active form pyruvate dehydrogenase provide augmented capacity generation acetyl-CoA units de novo fatty acid synthesis livers mature mice.
