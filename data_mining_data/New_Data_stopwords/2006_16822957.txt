 effects high-fat (HF) feeding gene expression small intestine examined using obesity-resistant A/J mice obesity-prone C57BL/6J (B6) mice. strains mice maintained low-fat (LF; 5% fat) HF (30% fat) diets 2 wk. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed lipid metabolism-related genes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I, liver fatty acid binding protein, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4, NADP(+)-dependent cytosolic malic enzyme, upregulated HF feeding strains mice. upregulated gene expression levels higher A/J mice B6 mice, suggesting active lipid metabolism small intestine A/J mice. prominent upregulation lipid metabolism-related genes specific small intestine; expression levels little unchanged liver, muscle, white adipose tissue. increase HF feeding predominant expression intestinal lipid metabolism-related genes A/J mice reflected enzyme activities; malic enzyme, CPT, beta-oxidation activities increased HF feeding, upregulated malic enzyme CPT activities significantly higher obesity-resistant A/J mice compared obesity-prone B6 mice. findings suggest intestinal lipid metabolism associated susceptibility obesity.
