 BACKGROUND: Metabolic shifts disease great interest development novel therapeutics. cancer treatment, therapies exploit metabolic phenotype associated oncogenesis cancer progression. One recent strategy involves depletion cofactors needed maintain high rate glycolysis seen Warburg effect. Specifically, blocking nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis via nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibition depletes cancer cells NAD needed glycolysis. characterize metabolic phenotype vivo describe changes flux treatment, non-invasive biomarkers necessary. One biomarker hyperpolarized (HP) [1-(13) C] pyruvate, clinically translatable probe allows real-time assessment metabolism. METHODS: therefore developed cell perfusion system compatible HP magnetic resonance (MR) positron emission tomography (PET) develop translatable biomarkers response NAMPT inhibition reduced volume cell cultures. RESULTS: Using platform, observed reduction pyruvate flux lactate dehydrogenase NAMPT inhibition prostate cancer cells, showed HP lactate 2-[(18) F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) used biomarkers treatment response targeted agents. Moreover, observed dynamic flux changes whereby HP pyruvate re-routed alanine, providing positive negative indicators treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: study demonstrated feasibility MR/PET compatible bioreactor approach efficiently explore cell tissue metabolism, understanding critical developing clinically translatable biomarkers disease states responses therapeutics.
