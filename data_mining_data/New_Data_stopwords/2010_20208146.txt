 inclusion novel small molecules crystallization experiments provided encouraging results method emerging promising alternative strategy crystallizing 'problematic' biological macromolecules. small molecules ability promote lattice formation stabilizing intermolecular interactions protein crystals. Here, use 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid (PTS), provides helpful intermolecular bridge Leishmania mexicana PYK (LmPYK) macromolecules crystal, reported, resulting rapid formation stable crystal lattice neutral pH greatly improved X-ray diffraction results. refined structure LmPYK-PTS complex revealed negatively charged PTS molecule stacked positively charged (surface-exposed) arginine side chains neighbouring LmPYK molecules crystal lattice.
