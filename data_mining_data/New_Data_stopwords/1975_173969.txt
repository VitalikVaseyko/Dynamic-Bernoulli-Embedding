 Skeletal muscle adapts endurance excerise, long distance running, increase capacity aerobic metabolism. reflected increased capacity whole homogenates mitochondrial fraction muscle oxidize pyruvate long chain fatty acids. Underlying increase ability obtain energy respiration increase levels number mitochondrial enzymes. include enzymes involved fatty acid oxidation, enzymes citric acid cycle, components respiratory chain link oxidation succinate NADH oxygen, coupling factor 1. increases mitochondrial enzyme activity appear due increase enzyme protein evidenced doubling concentration cytochrome c 60% increase protein content mitochondrial fraction skeletal muscle. Electronmicroscopic studies suggest increases size number mitochondria responsible increase mitochondrial protein. alteration mitochondrial composition also occurs, mitochondrial enzymes increasing 2-fold, others increasing 35% 60%, others, including mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase adenylate kinase increase all. result exercise induced biochemical adaptations skeletal muscle tends become like heart muscle enzyme pattern.
