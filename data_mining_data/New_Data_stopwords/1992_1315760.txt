 Bovine lung cGMP-binding cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cG-BPDE) potent relatively specific substrate cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) compared cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK) (Thomas, M. K., Francis, S. H., Corbin, J. D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14971-14978). synthetic peptide, RKISASEFDRPLR (BPDEtide), synthesized corresponding sequence surrounding phosphorylation site cG-BPDE. BPDEtide retained cGK/cAK kinase specificity demonstrated native cG-BPDE: apparent Km BPDEtide cGK 5-fold lower cAK (Km = 68 320 microM, respectively). Vmax values 11 mumol/min/mg cGK 3.2 mumol/min/mg cAK. peptide phosphorylated measurable extent protein kinase C calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Thus, primary amino acid sequence peptide substrate sufficient confer kinase specificity. Studies crude tissue extracts indicated BPDEtide selective peptide substrate documented measuring cGK activity. Peptide analogs BPDEtide synthesized determine contribution specific residues cGK cAK substrate specificity. Substitution Lys amino-terminal Arg reduce cGK/cAK specificity; neither exchange Ala non-phosphorylated Ser removal 3 carboxyl-terminal residues. truncated BPDEtide (RKISASE) served equally well substrate (Km approximately 90 microM) kinases. However, restoration Phe, yield RKISASEF, reproduced original cGK/cAK specificity BPDEtide (Km = 120 480 microM, respectively), primarily decreasing affinity cAK. Addition carboxyl-terminal Phe peptide RKRSRAE (derived sequence cGK phosphorylation site histone H2B) peptide LRRASLG (derived sequence cAK phosphorylation site pyruvate kinase) also improved cGK/cAK specificity decreasing affinity cAK. data suggested Phe substrate tested negative determinant cAK.
