 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency well-characterized X-linked inherited disorder humans reported horses. describe persistent hemolytic anemia hyperbilirubinemia due severe G6PD deficiency American Saddlebred colt. abnormalities colt's erythrocytes compared healthy horses (n = 22-35) included increased activities hexokinase pyruvate kinase, decreased concentrations reduced glutathione reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), increased concentration oxidized NADP. Morphologic abnormalities included eccentrocytosis, pyknocytosis, anisocytosis, macrocytosis, increased number Howell-Jolly bodies. Scanning transmission electron microscopic examinations revealed eccentrocytes contracted spherical regions thin collapsed regions. Eccentrocytes electron dense normal erythrocytes examined transmission electron microscopy. exposed acetylphenylhydrazine, erythrocytes G6PD-deficient colt produced smaller Heinz bodies erythrocytes normal horses. Abnormalities colt's dam included presence eccentrocytes pyknocytes; average erythrocyte G6PD activity slightly range reference values.
