 Dysfunction energy metabolism-including pathways localized mitochondria-has implicated pathogenesis wide array disorders, ranging cancer neurodegenerative diseases type II diabetes. inherent complexities energy mitochondrial metabolism present significant obstacle effort understand role molecular processes play development disease. help unravel complexities, systems biology methods applied develop array computational metabolic models, ranging mitochondria-specific processes genome-scale cellular networks. constraint-based (CB) models efficiently simulate aspects normal aberrant metabolism various genetic environmental conditions. Development models leverages-and also provides powerful means integrate interpret-information wide range sources including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, enzyme kinetics. Here, review variety mechanistic modeling studies explore metabolic functions, deficiency disorders, aberrant biochemical pathways mitochondria related regions cell.
