 Among characteristics acquired many tumour cells shift using oxidative phosphorylation using glycolysis ATP production. Although nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family transcriptional regulators important roles tumorigenesis, ability function regulators metabolism recently investigated. revealed importance crosstalk NF-kappaB, p53 tumour suppressor crucial cell signalling pathways. review discusses mechanisms NF-kappaB regulates tumour cell metabolism important role p53 determining consequences NF-kappaB activity. also proposes model NF-kappaB contributes shift glycolytic ATP production regulation nuclear mitochondrial gene expression.
