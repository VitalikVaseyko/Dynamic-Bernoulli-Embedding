 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA reported up-regulated gene heart skeletal muscle carnitine-deficient juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mice fed conditions. PDK4 plays important role inhibition glucose oxidation via phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). study evaluated meaning increased PDK4 mRNA glucose metabolism investigating PDK4 protein levels, PDC activity glucose uptake heart skeletal muscle JVS mice. PDK4 protein levels heart skeletal muscle fed JVS mice increased accordance mRNA levels, protein enriched mitochondria. PDK4 protein co-fractionated PDC sucrose density gradient centrifugation, like PDK2 protein; however, activities pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) active form heart skeletal muscle fed JVS mice similar fed control mice. Fed JVS mice showed significantly higher glucose uptake heart similar uptake skeletal muscle compared fed control mice. Thus, carnitine deficiency fed conditions, glucose preferentially utilized heart energy source despite increased PDK4 protein levels mitochondria. preferred glucose utilization may involved developing cardiac hypertrophy carnitine deficiency fatty acid oxidation abnormality.
