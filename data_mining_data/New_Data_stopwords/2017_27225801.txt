 Dynamics large nonlinear complex systems, like metabolic networks, depend several parameters. metabolic pathway may switch another pathway accordance current state parameters normal cancer cells. Here, parameter values unknown us. fuzzy logic controller (FLC) developed purpose modeling metabolic networks approximating reasons behaviour system applying expert knowledge track switching metabolic pathways. simulation results track switching glycolysis gluconeogenesis, well glycolysis pentose phosphate pathways (PPP) normal cells. Unlike normal cells, pyruvate kinase (M2 isoform) (PKM2) switches alternatively two oligomeric forms, i.e. active tetramer relatively low activity dimer, cancer cells. Besides, coordination among PKM2 switching enzymes catalyzing PPP. phenomena help cancer cells maintain high energy demand macromolecular synthesis. However, reduction initial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) low concentration, decreasing initial glucose uptake, destroying coordination glycolysis PPP, replacement PKM2 relatively inactive oligomeric form (dimer) inhibition translation PKM2 may destabilize mutated control mechanism mammalian central carbon metabolic (CCM) pathway cancer cells. performance model compared appropriately existing ones.
