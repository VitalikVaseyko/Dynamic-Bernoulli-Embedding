 Mouse strains AcB55 AcB61 resistant malaria virtue mutation erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (Pklr(I90N)). Linkage analysis [AcB55 x A/J] F2 mice detected second locus (Char9; logarithm odds = 4.74) regulates blood-stage replication Plasmodium chabaudi independently Pklr. characterized 77 genes Char9 locus tissue-specific expression, strain-specific alterations gene expression, polymorphic variants possibly associated differential susceptibility. identified Vnn1/Vnn3 likely candidates responsible Char9. Vnn3/Vnn1 map within conserved haplotype block show expression levels strictly cis-regulated haplotype. absence Vnn messenger RNA expression lack pantetheinase protein activity tissues associated susceptibility malaria linked complex rearrangement Vnn3 promoter region. A/J strain also carries unique nonsense mutation leads truncated protein. Vanin genes code pantetheinase involved production cysteamine, key regulator host responses inflammatory stimuli. Administration cystamine vivo partially corrects susceptibility malaria A/J mice, measured reduced blood parasitemia decreased mortality. studies suggest pantetheinase critical host response malaria.
