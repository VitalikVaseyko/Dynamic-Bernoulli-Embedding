 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) known gatekeeper directing carbon flux glycolysis via inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. syncytialization placental trophoblasts, ATP production oxygen consumption increased meet enhanced energetic demands syntiotrophoblasts. hypothesized down-regulation PDK expression may play central role switch glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) syncytialization. using primary human trophoblasts, demonstrated PDK4 dominating PDK isoform human cytotrophoblasts, abundance substantially decreased upon syncytialization, accompanied decreases lactate production increases ATP production. Knock-down PDK4 expression reduced lactate production increased ATP production, over-expression PDK4 increased lactate production decreased ATP production, indicating down-regulation PDK4 key shift glycolysis OXPHOS syncytialization. Moreover, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)/cAMP/PKA pathway demonstrated involved down-regulation PDK4 expression upon syncytialization. Taken together, findings disclosed down-regulation PDK4 critical metabolic shift glycolysis OXPHOS syncytialization, may prerequisite proper implementation syncytiotrophoblast functions.
