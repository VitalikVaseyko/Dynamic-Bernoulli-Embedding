 numerical analysis glycolytic model containing enzymes phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase reveals different types entrainment, well chaotic response sinusoidal substrate input. Entrainment response periods 1, 2, 3, 5 7-times input flux period aperiodic behaviour verified measurements NADH fluorescence extracts Saccharomyces cerevisiae theoretically predicted range. stroboscopic transfer function obtained aperiodic signal admits period 3, implying chaos according Li-Yorke theorem.
