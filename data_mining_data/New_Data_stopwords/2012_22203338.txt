 Glucose lipid metabolism pancreatic islet organs poorly characterized. present study, using model carnivorous rainbow trout, glucose-intolerant fish, assessed mRNA expression levels several genes involved glucose lipid metabolism (including ATP-citrate lyase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 isoforms, CPT; mitochondrial isoform phosphoenolpyrutave carboxykinase, mPEPCK pyruvate kinase, PK) glucosensing (glucose transporter type 2, Glut2; glucokinase, GK potassium channel, K(ATP)) Brockmann bodies. evaluated response parameters changes feeding status (food deprived vs. fed fish) well changes amount carbohydrate (dextrin) diet. general inhibition glycolytic (including glucosensing marker GK) beta-oxidation pathways found comparing fed versus food-deprived fish. comparing fish feeding either low- high-carbohydrate diets, found genes related lipid metabolism controlled feeding status carbohydrate content (fatty acid synthase, CPTs). Findings discussed context pancreatic regulation glucose lipid metabolism fish, show trout pancreatic metabolism partially adapt high-carbohydrate diet, molecular actors studied seem poorly regulated (K(ATP)) may contribute glucose intolerance observed species fed high-carbohydrate diets.
