 Glycerinated single fibres dorsal longitudinal muscle Lethocerus maximus isometrically contracted MgATP-salines (10 microM Ca2+; 1.5 mM Mg2+; pH 6.7; 22 degrees C 20 mM PEP; 100 U/ml pyruvate kinase). ratio ATPase activity tension decreased factor 2 reducing ATP-concentration 15 0.5 mM. ATP-concentrations (0.5-15 mM), fibres showed tension adjustments response small step changes length characteristic actively contracting muscle: i) elastic phase depend ATP-concentration ii) quick phase stress relaxation least two exponential components; iii) phase delayed tension generation. increase size length step and/or decrease ATP-concentration slowed quick phase delayed phase. Similar results obtained skinned cardiac muscle (pig right ventricle). see, isolated contractile system affected increase light chain phosphorylation, tension transients studied skinned right ventricular muscle fibres incubation ATP gamma (2 mM), pure myosin light chain kinase (9 micrograms/ml), Calmodulin (1 microM) Ca2+ (0.8 microM). isometric tension development elicited 20 microM Ca2+ ATP salt solution barely affected presence enzyme, ATPase activity decreased 25% control. also marked decrease (about 50%) contraction velocity determined recovery tension following quick release. Quick stretches cause immediate increase tension followed rapid fall subsequent rise tension. velocity tension rise decreased approximately 30% incubation myosin light chain kinase.
