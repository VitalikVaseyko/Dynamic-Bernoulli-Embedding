 methemoglobin formation methemoglobin reduction canine erythrocytes characterized inherited high potassium (K+) normal reduced glutathione concentrations (HK-low GSH cells) compared canine erythrocytes inherited high K+ high GSH concentrations (HK-high GSH cells) normal canine erythrocytes low K+ low (= normal) GSH concentrations (LK-low GSH cells). rate methemoglobin formation induced sodium nitrite (NaNO2) order; LK-low GSH > HK-low GSH > HK-high GSH cells, difference among groups significant 7 15 min. Methemoglobin reduction medium containing glucose occurred rapidly HK-high GSH HK-low GSH cells, rate reduction 1.7-fold higher LK-low GSH cells. Accumulation pyruvate equivalent amount methemoglobin reduced indicated methemoglobin predominantly reduced NADH-methemoglobin reductase coupled glycolysis. HK-low GSH cells showed increased glycolytic rate high pyruvate kinase activity similar levels HK-high GSH cells. therefore evident HK-low GSH cells offer greater protection oxidation hemoglobin methemoglobin LK-low GSH cells increased glycolytic rate HK-low GSH cells attributable high pyruvate kinase activity cells.
