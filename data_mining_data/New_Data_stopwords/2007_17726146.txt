 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARdelta) activation results upregulation genes associated skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation mitochondrial uncoupling. However, direct, noninvasive assessment lipid metabolism mitochondrial energy coupling skeletal muscle following PPARdelta stimulation examined. Therefore, study examined response selective PPARdelta agonist (GW610742X 5 100 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) 8 days) skeletal-muscle lipid metabolism mitochondrial coupling efficiency rats using vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). decrease intramyocellular lipid-to-total creatine ratio assessed vivo (1)H-MRS soleus tibialis anterior muscles day 7 (reduced 49 46%, respectively; P < 0.01) high dose. Following (1)H-MRS experiment (day 8), [1-(13)C]glucose administered conscious rats assess metabolism soleus muscle. relative fat-vs.-carbohydrate oxidation rate increased dose-dependent manner (increased 52 93% 5 100 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) groups, respectively; P < 0.05). separate experiments mitochondrial coupling assessed vivo (day 7), (31)P-MRS used measure hindlimb ATP synthesis (13)C-MRS used measure hindlimb tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (V(tca)). alteration, either dose, mitochondrial coupling efficiency measured ratio unidirectional ATP synthesis flux V(tca). Soleus muscle GLUT4 expression decreased twofold, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a, uncoupling protein 2 3 expression increased two- threefold high dose (P < 0.05). summary, first noninvasive measurements illustrating selective PPARdelta-mediated decrease muscle lipid content consistent shift metabolic substrate utilization carbohydrate lipid. However, mitochondrial-energy coupling efficiency altered presence increased uncoupling protein expression.
