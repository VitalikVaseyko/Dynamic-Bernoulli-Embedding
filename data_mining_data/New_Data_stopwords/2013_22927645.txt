 GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor-related protein 1 (ARFRP1) located trans-Golgi compartment regulates recruitment Arf-like 1 (ARL1) effector golgin-245 compartment. Here, show liver-specific knockout Arfrp1 mouse (Arfrp1(liv-/-)) resulted early growth retardation, associated reduced hepatic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) secretion. Accordingly, suppression Arfrp1 primary hepatocytes resulted significant reduction IGF1 release. However, hepatic secretion IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) affected absence ARFRP1. addition, Arfrp1(liv-/-) mice exhibited decreased glucose transport liver, leading 50% reduction glycogen stores well marked retardation glycogen storage fasting refeeding. abnormalities glucose metabolism attributable reduced protein levels intracellular retention glucose transporter GLUT2 Arfrp1(liv-/-) livers. consequence impaired glucose uptake liver, expression levels carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), transcription factor regulated glucose concentration, target genes (glucokinase pyruvate kinase) markedly reduced. data indicate ARFRP1 liver involved regulation IGF1 secretion GLUT2 sorting thereby essential normal growth glycogen storage.
