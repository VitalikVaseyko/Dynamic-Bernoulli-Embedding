 purpose study investigate possible vivo effects (-)-nicotine, ethanol, adenosine agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) injected individually well various combinations glucose utilization fresh cerebellar slices mice. Mice received ICV (-)-nicotine CHA followed 5 min later test dose ethanol (2 g/kg; IP). Animals killed 20 min postethanol treatment fresh slices (300 microns) cerebellum incubated glucose medium Warburg flasks using 14C-glucose tracer. Trapped 14CO2 counted estimate glucose utilization. Ethanol treatment markedly accentuated glucose utilization, whereas pretreatment (-)-nicotine (125 250 ng, ICV) resulted significant attenuation ethanol-induced increase glucose utilization. However, ICV (-)-nicotine (125 ng) alone produce change cerebellar glucose utilization. attenuation ethanol-induced increase glucose utilization (-)-nicotine nearly totally blocked ICV hexamethonium, purported nicotinic antagonist, suggesting participation cholinergic-nicotinic receptors. (-)-nicotine pretreatment also significantly attenuated ICV CHA (25 ng)-induced increase glucose utilization accentuation ethanol-induced increase glucose utilization CHA. antagonistic effect (-)-nicotine CHA- ethanol-induced increase glucose utilization indicating interaction (-)-nicotine ethanol (-)-nicotine adenosine may suggest involvement postreceptor (nicotinic adenosine) mechanisms including ionic channels.
