 X-linked muscular dystrophy highly progressive disease childhood characterized primary genetic abnormalities dystrophin gene. Senescent mdx specimens used large-scale survey potential age-related alterations dystrophic phenotype, established mdx animal model dystrophinopathy exhibits progressive deterioration muscle tissue age. Since mdx tibialis anterior muscle frequently used model system muscular dystrophy research, employed particular muscle determine global changes dystrophic skeletal muscle proteome. comparison mdx mice aged 8 weeks versus 22 months mass-spectrometry-based proteomics revealed altered expression levels 8 distinct protein species. Increased levels shown carbonic anhydrase, aldolase, electron transferring flavoprotein, expressions pyruvate kinase, myosin, tropomyosin, small heat shock protein Hsp27 found reduced aged muscle. Immunoblotting confirmed age-dependent changes density key muscle proteins mdx muscle. Thus, segmental necrosis mdx tibialis anterior muscle appears trigger age-related protein perturbations due dystrophin deficiency. identification novel indicators progressive muscular dystrophy might useful establishment muscle subtype-specific biomarker signature dystrophinopathy.
