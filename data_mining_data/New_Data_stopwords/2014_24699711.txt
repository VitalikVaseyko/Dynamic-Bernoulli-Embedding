 Cancer cells possess aberrant proteomes arise disruption genes involved physiological protein degradation. demonstrate presence promoter CpG island hypermethylation-linked inactivation DERL3 (Derlin-3), key gene endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway, human tumours. restoration vitro vivo DERL3 activity highlights tumour suppressor features gene. Using stable isotopic labelling amino acids cell culture workflow differential proteome analysis, identify SLC2A1 (glucose transporter 1, GLUT1) downstream target DERL3. importantly, SLC2A1 overexpression mediated DERL3 epigenetic loss contributes Warburg effect studied cells pinpoints subset human tumours greater vulnerability drugs targeting glycolysis.
