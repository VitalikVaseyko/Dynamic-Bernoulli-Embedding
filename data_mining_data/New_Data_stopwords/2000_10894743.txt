 mevalonate pathway glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP)-pyruvate pathway alternative routes biosynthesis central isoprenoid precursor, isopentenyl diphosphate. Genomic analysis revealed staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci possess genes predicted encode enzymes mevalonate pathway GAP-pyruvate pathway, unlike Bacillus subtilis gram-negative bacteria studied, possess components latter pathway. Phylogenetic comparative genome analyses suggest genes mevalonate biosynthesis gram-positive cocci, highly divergent mammals, horizontally transferred primitive eukaryotic cell. Enterococci uniquely encode bifunctional protein predicted possess 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activities. Genetic disruption experiments shown five genes encoding proteins involved pathway (HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase) essential vitro growth Streptococcus pneumoniae standard conditions. Allelic replacement HMG-CoA synthase gene rendered organism auxotrophic mevalonate severely attenuated murine respiratory tract infection model. mevalonate pathway thus represents potential antibacterial target low-G+C gram-positive cocci.
