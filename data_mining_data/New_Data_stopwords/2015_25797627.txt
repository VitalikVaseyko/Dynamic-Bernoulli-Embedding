 Ionizing radiation used treat range cancers. Despite recent technological progress, radiation therapy damage skin administration site. specific molecular mechanisms involved effect fully characterized. study, effects pyruvate, radiation-induced skin injury investigated, including role pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2) signaling pathway. Next generation sequencing (NGS) identified wide range gene expression differences control irradiated mice, including reduced expression PDK2. confirmed using Q-PCR. Cell culture studies demonstrated PDK2 overexpression high cellular pyruvate concentration inhibited radiation-induced cytokine expression. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated radiation-induced skin thickening gene expression changes. Oral pyruvate treatment markedly downregulated radiation-induced changes skin thickness inflammatory cytokine expression. findings indicated regulation pyruvate metabolic pathway could provide effective approach control radiation-induced skin damage.
