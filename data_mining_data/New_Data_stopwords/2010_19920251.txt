 Warburg effect describes pro-oncogenic metabolism switch cancer cells take glucose normal tissue favor incomplete oxidation glucose even presence oxygen. better understand tyrosine kinase signaling, commonly increased tumors, regulates Warburg effect, performed phosphoproteomic studies. found oncogenic forms fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 inhibit pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform direct phosphorylation PKM2 tyrosine residue 105 (Y(105)). inhibits formation active, tetrameric PKM2 disrupting binding PKM2 cofactor fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Furthermore, found phosphorylation PKM2 Y(105) common human cancers. presence PKM2 mutant phenylalanine substituted Y(105) (Y105F) cancer cells leads decreased cell proliferation hypoxic conditions, increased oxidative phosphorylation reduced lactate production, reduced tumor growth xenografts nude mice. findings suggest tyrosine phosphorylation regulates PKM2 provide metabolic advantage tumor cells, thereby promoting tumor growth.
