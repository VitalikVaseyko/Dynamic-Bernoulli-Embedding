 highly purfied pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.2.4.1) uncomplexed pyruvate dehydrogenase bovine kidney heart mitochondria phosphorylated inactivated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase [gamma-32P]ATP. Tryptic digestion phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase yielded three phosphopeptides, mono- (site 1) di- (sites 1 2) phosphorylated tetradecapeptide monophosphorylated nonapeptide (site 3). amino acid sequences three phosphopeptides established Tyr-His-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asn-Pro-Gly-Val-Ser-Tyr-Arg, Tyr-His-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asn-Pro-Gly-Val-Ser(P)-Tyr-Arg, Tyr-Gly-Met-Gly-Thr-Ser(P)-Val-Glu-Arg. Phosphorylation proceeded markedly faster site 1 sites 2 3, phosphorylation site 1 correlated closely inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase. Complete inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase associated incorporation site 1 1.0--1.6 mol phosphoryl groups per mol enzyme. Since pyruvate dehydrogenase tetramer (alpha2beta2) since phosphorylation occurs alpha subunit, possibility half-site reactivity considered.
