 OBJECTIVE: investigate influence microtubule intervention drugs glycolytic key enzymes myocardial cells hypoxia. METHODS: primary passage cultured myocardial cells neonatal rats divided group (with hypoxia), B group (with hypoxia administration l0 micromol/L colchicine), C group (with hypoxia administration 5 micromol/L taxol), group (with hypoxia administration 10 micromol/L taxol), E group (with hypoxia administration 15 micromol/L taxol). morphology microtubule observed laser scanning microscope (LSM). cell vitality assayed cell counting kit (CCK). activities hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assayed colorimetry. RESULTS: group B E, microtubule structure damaged heavily, cell vitality decreased significantly [The cell vitality (89.99 +/- 3.47)% B group (84.56 +/- 6.61)% E group, respectively, 1.0 post hypoxia hour (PHH), hoth values obviously lower group (97.44 +/- 1.76)%, P < 0.01]. HK, PK PFK activities decreased obviously. activities HK, PK PFK group C similar group. Compared groups, degree damage microtubule structure group milden. activities HK, PK PFK group 0.5 - 6.0 PHH significantly higher group. activity LDH group increased hypoxia. CONCLUSION: Proper concentration microtubule-stabilizing drugs alleviate damages microtubule structure, enhance activity glycolytic key enzymes myocardial cells early stage hypoxia.
