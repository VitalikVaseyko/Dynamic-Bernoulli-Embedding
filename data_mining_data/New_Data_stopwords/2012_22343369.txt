 Recent studies shown atorvastain anti-inflammatory effect prevent cardiac hypertrophy. development cardiac hypertrophy dysfunction associated increase cardiac glucose utilization. study, investigated effect atorvastatin glucose oxidation tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated cardiomyocytes (H9c2 cells) potential role peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) effect. Exposure H9c2 cells TNF-alpha inhibited expressions PGC-1alpha, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, carnitine palmityl transferase 1 induced significant increase glucose oxidation rate. However, effects TNF-alpha significantly reversed atorvastatin. Selective silence PGC-1alpha H9c2 cells resulted downregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 carnitine palmityl transferase 1 increased TNF-alpha-induced glucose oxidation. Interestingly, effect atorvastatin PGC-1alpha almost abolished mevalonate partially farnesol geranylgeraniol. conclusion, atorvastatin inhibits TNF-alpha-induced glucose oxidation PGC-1alpha upregulation cardiomyocytes, might associated regulation isoprenoid metabolites.
