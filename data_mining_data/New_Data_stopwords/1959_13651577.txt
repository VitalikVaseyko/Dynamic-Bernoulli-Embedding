 effects reserpine hydrallazine upon oxygen uptake preparations rat brain, liver, kidney rabbit aorta investigated using Warburg "Direct" method. tissues reserpine significantly stimulate respiration doses used. Concentrations 10 50 mug./ml. significant effect upon respiration, higher doses (330 mug./ml.) depressed tissues studied. effect also seen rat brain reserpine concentration 100 mug./ml. significant effect tissues. Hydrallazine (50 100 mug./ml.) depressed respiration tissues studied. Stimulation lower doses seen.After sublethal doses reserpine, depletion energy rich phosphate compounds occurred brain liver skeletal muscle heart. Hydrallazine also depleted brain energy rich phosphate compounds, affect liver, heart, skeletal muscle. bearing results mode action reserpine hydrallazine discussed.
