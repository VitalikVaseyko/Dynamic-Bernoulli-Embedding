 Cancer metabolism emerged important area research recent years. Elucidation metabolic differences cancer normal cells underlying mechanisms advance understanding fundamental cancer cell biology also provide important basis development new therapeutic strategies novel compounds selectively eliminate cancer cells targeting unique metabolism. article reviews several important metabolic alterations cancer cells, emphasis increased aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) glutamine addiction, discusses mechanisms may contribute metabolic changes. addition, metabolic alterations cancer stem cells, mitochondrial metabolism influence drug sensitivity, potential therapeutic strategies agents target cancer metabolism also discussed.
