 Metabolic abnormalities underlying diabetes primarily result lack adequate insulin action associated changes protein phosphorylation gene expression. define full set alterations gene expression skeletal muscle caused diabetes loss insulin action, used Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays streptozotocin-diabetic mice. genes studied, 235 identified changed diabetes, 129 genes up-regulated 106 down-regulated. Analysis revealed coordinated regulation key steps glucose lipid metabolism, mitochondrial electron transport, transcriptional regulation, protein trafficking. mRNAs enzymes fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway increased, whereas GLUT4, hexokinase II, E1 component pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, subunits four complexes mitochondrial electron transport chain coordinately down-regulated. half alterations gene expression diabetic mice could corrected toward normal 3 days insulin treatment euglycemia. data point yet undefined mechanisms highly coordinated regulation gene expression insulin potential new targets therapy diabetes mellitus.
