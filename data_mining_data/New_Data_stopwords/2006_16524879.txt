 Control fatty acid homeostasis crucial prevent insulin resistance. fasting, plasma fatty acid level depends triglyceride lipolysis fatty acid re-esterification within fat cells. rodents, Rosiglitazone controls fatty acid homeostasis stimulating two pathways adipocytes, glyceroneogenesis glycerol phosphorylation, provide glycerol 3-phosphate necessary fatty acid re-esterification. Here, analyzed functionality pathways controlling fatty acid release subcutaneous adipose tissue samples lean overweight women Rosiglitazone ex vivo treatment. controls, pyruvate, used substrate glyceroneogenesis, could contribute re-esterification 65% fatty acids released basal lipolysis, whereas glycerol phosphorylation accounted 14 +/- 9%. However, efficiency glyceroneogenesis diminished body mass index (BMI) women increased. Rosiglitazone treatment, increase either pyruvate- glycerol-dependent fatty acid re-esterification strictly correlated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glycerol kinase, key enzymes pathway, depended BMI women. Whereas Rosiglitazone responsiveness glyceroneogenesis rather constant according BMI women, glycerol phosphorylation mostly enhanced lean women (BMI < 27). Overall, data indicate that, whereas glyceroneogenesis utilized glycerol phosphorylation fatty acid re-esterification human subcutaneous adipose tissue physiological situation, solicited response Rosiglitazone lower efficiency BMI increased.
