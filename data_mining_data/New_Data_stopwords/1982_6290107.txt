 Erythrocyte glycolysis studied anaemia associated protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) Kivu. Several results compatible lowering mean age erythrocyte population, notably raised levels glucose-6-phosphate, hexokinase, Na+-K+- adenosinetriphosphatases potassium, low sodium concentration. Non-significant differences observed glucose utilization, lactate formation, concentrations fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, adenosine diphosphate pyruvate kinase; gross disturbance cation transport. level adenosine triphosphate slightly decreased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate elevated, spite anaemia. latter could explained instability metabolite. concluded slight erythrocyte glycolytic abnormalities may occur anaemia Kivu PEM, main cause haemolysis observed syndrome.
