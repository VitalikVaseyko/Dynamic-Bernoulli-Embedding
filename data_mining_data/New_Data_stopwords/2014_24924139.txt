 Magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy offers convenient means rapid determination metabolic profiles intact malignant tissues high resolution. implementation MAS-NMR spectroscopy requires minimal sample processing, hence compatible complementary histological biochemical analyses. metabolites routinely detected (1)H MAS-NMR spectra simultaneously inform many metabolic alterations characterize malignant cells, including altered choline metabolism so-called Warburg effect. Clinical MAS-NMR profiles attributed diagnostic prognostic value, correlating disease subtype, tumor stage/grade, response chemotherapy, patient survival. Herein, scientific rationale behind MAS-NMR utility translational cancer research patient stratification summarized. Moreover, basic protocol analysis tumor samples MAS-NMR spectroscopy detailed.
