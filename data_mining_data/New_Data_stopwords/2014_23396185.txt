 Survival along optimal proliferation neuronal precursors determines outcomes endogenous cellular repair CNS. Cellular-oxidation based cell death described several neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, study aimed identification potent targets oxidative damage neuronal precursors effective prevention natural flavonoid, Quercetin. Neuronal precursor cells (NPCs), Nestin+ GFAP (Glial fibrillary acidic protein)+ isolated cultured adult rat SVZ (subventricular zone). cells challenged single dose H2O2 (50muM) and/or pre-treated different concentrations Quercetin. H2O2 severely limited cellular viability expansion neurospheres. Cellular-oxidation studies revealed reduction glutathione dependent redox buffering along depletion enzymatic cellular antioxidants might potentiate nitrite (NO2(-)) superoxide anion (O2(-)) mediated peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) formation irreversible protein nitration. identified depleted PK-M2 (M2 isoform pyruvate kinase) activity apoptosis NPCs revealed genomic DNA fragmentation elevated PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) activity along increased Caspase activity initiated severely depolarised mitochondrial membranes. However, pre-treatment Quercetin dose-response manner prevented changes restored expansion neurospheres preferably neutralizing oxidative conditions thereby reducing peroxynitrite formation, protein nitration PK-M2 depletion. results unravel potential interactions oxidative environment respiration survival activation precursors offer promise shown natural flavonoid protective strategy neuronal precursors adult brain.
