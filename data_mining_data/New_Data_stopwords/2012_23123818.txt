 PURPOSE REVIEW: Cancer cachexia complex metabolic syndrome manifests progressive wasting disorder. Recent findings substantially improved understanding unique entity shedding light potentially significant overlooked morbidity form cardiac functional changes may occur tandem cachexia. Moreover, recent technological advances, application metabolomic analysis, yielded better understanding metabolic changes accompany condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence murine studies indicates skeletal muscle wasting cancer cachexia may accompanied cardiac muscle wasting. decreased heart weight accompanied functional cardiac changes, suggestive congestive heart failure. addition, metabolomic analysis body fluids tissues distinguishes cancer cachexia's unique metabolic fingerprint separate entity, different healthy controls, tumor burden, caloric restriction, aging. also gives insight metabolic changes occur affected tissues Warburg effect often described muscle. SUMMARY: Translational investigations potential cardiac malfunction cancer patients metabolomic analyses patients' sera tissues warranted determine whether changes upheld humans.
