 Aluminium (Al) toxicity one important limiting factors crop yield acidic soils. However, mechanisms confer Al tolerance still remain largely unknown. understand molecular mechanism confers different tolerance Al, performed global transcriptome analysis roots leaves two contrasting soybean genotypes, BX10 (Al-tolerant) BD2 (Al-sensitive) 0 50 muM Al(3+) treatments, respectively. Gene Ontology Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes Genomes analyses revealed expression levels genes involved lipid/carbohydrate metabolism jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated signalling pathway highly induced roots leaves soybean genotypes. gene encoding enzymes, including pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, ATP-citrate lyase glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 2, associated organic acid metabolism differentially expressed BX10 roots. addition, genes involved citrate transport differentially expressed. Among genes, FRD3b down-regulated BD2, whereas two multidrug toxic compound extrusion genes up-regulated soybean genotypes. findings confirmed BX10 roots secreted citrate BD2 withstand Al stress. gene encoding enzymes regulators, lipoxygenase, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, acyl-CoA oxidase jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins, involved JA biosynthesis signalling preferentially induced BD2 leaves. finding suggests JA defence response activated, possibly weakening growth aerial parts excessive resource consumption ATP biosynthesis deficiency. results suggest Al sensitivity soybean varieties could attributed low level citrate metabolism exudation roots high level JA-mediated defence response leaves.
