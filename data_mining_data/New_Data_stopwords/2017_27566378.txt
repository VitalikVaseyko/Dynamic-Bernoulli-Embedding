 Severe influenza characterized cytokine storm multiorgan failure. Influenza patients underlying diseases show rapid progression disease severity. major mechanism underlies multiorgan failure progressive stage infection, particularly patients underlying risk factors, mitochondrial energy crisis. relationship factors determine infection severity, influenza virus, cytokines, cellular trypsin hemagglutinin processing protease viral multiplication, accumulation metabolic intermediates ATP crisis mitochondria, termed "influenza virus-cytokine-trypsin" cycle. occurs initial stages infection, interconnected "metabolic disorders-cytokine" cycle middle late phase infection. Experiments using animal models highlighted complex relationship two cycles. New treatment options proposed target ATP crisis multiorgan failure late phase infection, rather antiviral treatments neuraminidase inhibitors work initial phase. options (i) restoration glucose oxidation mitochondria diisopropylamine dichloroacetate, inhibits infection-induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 activity, (ii) restoration long-chain fatty acid oxidation mitochondria l-carnitine bezafibrate, agonist peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors-beta/delta, transcriptionally upregulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase II. latter particularly effective patients influenza-associated encephalopathy thermolabile short half-life compound variants carnitine palmitoyltransferase II.
