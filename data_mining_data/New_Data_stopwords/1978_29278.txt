 1. high oxygen affinity fetal blood rabbits due low concentration 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) red cells. order gather informations factors responsible characteristic studied synthesis break-down 2,3-DPG fetal adult rabbit red cells vitro examined possible regulative pathways may lead low 2,3-DPG concentration vivo. 2. conditions 2,3-DPG 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) accumulate adult erythrocytes, i.e. solution containing inosine, pyruvate inorganic phosphate, amount 2,3-DPG synthetized fetal red cells 40% adult value 3-PGA measurable. Upon inhibition enolase NaF, however, 2,3-DPG 3-PGA increased similar extent fetal adult red cells. findings point towards differences pyruvate kinase (PK) reaction one rate limiting steps glycolysis. Direct measurements revealed tenfold higher PK activity fetal compared adult red cells. higher activity PK lead decreased concentration 3-PGA consecutive fall 2,3-DPG concentration. 3. factors, like decreased glucose utilization, decreased activity 2,3-DPG mutase increased 2,3-DPG phosphatase activity could excluded cause low 2,3-DPG concentration fetal red blood cells. holds extraerythrocytic factors like glucose concentration pH value fetal blood. 4. postnatal development rabbits PK activity decreased. 50 days birth, PK activity 20% fetal value still somewhat higher adult erythrocytes. change paralleled increase 2,3-DPG concentration half saturation oxygen pressure. respect synthesis 2,3-DPG ATP, fetal rabbit red cell comparable hereditary high PK activity human erythrocytes.
