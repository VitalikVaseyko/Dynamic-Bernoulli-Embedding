 Intracerebroventricular administration carbachol (27 nmol 5 microliters 0.15 NaCl) produced marked hyperglycemia 24-h fasted rats, despite negligible amounts preformed liver glycosyl residues. investigate possibility stimulation gluconeogenesis, conscious unrestrained rats continuously infused [14C]bicarbonate (0.51 microliters, 0.18 muCi/min) label incorporation circulating glucose determined intraventricular injection. rate 14C incorporation blood glucose fed rats affected intraventricular injection 0.15 NaCl increased significantly carbachol administration. fed 24-h fasted rats hyperglycemia induced intraventricular carbachol accompanied marked increases plasma lactate. Previous adrenodemedullation prevented hyperglycemia hyperlactemia. Liver pyruvate kinase activity reduced carbachol-treated rats, enzyme assayed suboptimal concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate absence fructose 1,6-biphosphate. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity affected. data suggest central chemical stimulation cholinergic agents induces rapid activation liver gluconeogenesis, probably results increased sympathetic outflow epinephrine secretion adrenal medulla.
