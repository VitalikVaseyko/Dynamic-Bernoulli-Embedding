 Primary hepatocytes treated nonesterified PUFA used model analyzing inhibitory effects dietary polyunsaturated fats lipogenic gene expression. Although nonesterified fatty acids play important signaling role starvation, completely recapitulate mechanism dietary fat presentation liver, delivered via chylomicron remnants. test effect remnant TG lipogenic enzyme expression, chylomicron remnants generated lymph rats intubated either safflower oil lard. remnants added medium primary rat hepatocytes culture accumulation mRNA genes involved carbohydrate lipid metabolism measured. PUFA-enriched remnants nonesterified PUFA inhibited expression maturation sterol response element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) expression lipogenic genes regulated transcription factor. remnants also inhibited expression glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), gene regulated post-transcriptional steps. contrast, PUFA-enriched remnants inhibit accumulation mRNA malic enzyme, glucokinase, L-pyruvate kinase, whereas nonesterified fatty acids caused decrease mRNA. genes regulated independently SREBP-1c. SFA-enriched remnants inhibit lipogenic gene expression, consistent lack inhibition lipogenesis dietary saturated fats. Thus, inhibitory action dietary polyunsaturated fats lipogenesis involves direct action chylomicron remnants liver.
