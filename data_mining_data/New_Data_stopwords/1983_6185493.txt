 Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase isolated complementation pyk mutant DNA wild type yeast genomic library. Pyruvate kinase enzyme activity 20-fold higher transformant compared parental strain glucose inducible. cloned gene localized hybridization DNA fragments yeast poly(A+) RNA complementation mutant defect select subclones. DNA sequence 2885 nucleotides encoding protein 499 amino acids reported. polypeptide chain 34 residues deduced yeast amino acid sequence closely resembles peptide sequence ADP binding site bovine muscle pyruvate kinase. 5' end pyruvate kinase mRNA mapped starts within DNA sequence CAAG -38 -27 nucleotides upstream first ATG. note sequence PyAAPu region appears common consensus site yeast RNA polymerase II transcriptional starts.
