 Skeletal muscle examined colony mdx strain myopathic mice. Sixty-five mice 22 303 days age, showed extensive recurrent areas necrosis regeneration muscle fibres, often accompanied active cellular infiltration. Morphometry soleus muscle revealed abnormal proportion small large muscle fibres; half muscle fibres contained 'central' (non-peripheral) nuclei. histochemical muscle fibre-type grouping detected. Serum activities muscle-derived enzymes greatly elevated animals probably reflect enzyme leakage damaged muscle fibres. Histological evidence cardiomyopathy found 13 mice. mdx myopathy thus shows features seen Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Mdx differs Duchenne dystrophy principally exhibits greater degree compensatory muscle regeneration absence fibro-fatty replacement muscle fibres.
