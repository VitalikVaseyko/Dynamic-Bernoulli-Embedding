 identification various fecal biomarkers provided insight intestinal milieu. markers associated innate immune system gut, apart novel M2-pyruvate kinase. innate immunity gut plays role maintaining fine balance tolerance commensal bacteria immune response potential pathogens. complex system, comprises multiple elements, including antimicrobial peptides (e.g., defensins, cathelicidins, lactoferrin, osteoprotegerin), inflammatory proteins (e.g., calprotectin S100A12), microbial products (e.g., short-chain fatty acids). Dysfunction component lead development intestinal disease, different diseases associated different fecal levels biomarkers. fecal biomarker provides information specific biological disease processes. Therefore, stool quantification biomarkers provides non-invasive method define potential pathways behind pathogenesis diseases assist assessment diagnosis various gastrointestinal conditions. abovementioned fecal biomarkers role intestinal health disease reviewed paper pediatric focus.
