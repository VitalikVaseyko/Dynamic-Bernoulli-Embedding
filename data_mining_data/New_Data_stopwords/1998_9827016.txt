 Activities hexokinase (HK), glucokinase (GK) pyruvate kinase (PK), measured. expression GK mRNA investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) leukocytes (WBC) dogs cats. significant differences dogs cats found concentrations blood glucose plasma insulin. Dog WBC showed GK activities specific fragment predicted size 574 bp containing conserved region including glucose- ATP-binding domains GK determined RT-PCR. However, cat WBC, activities specific fragment GK absent. fasting, activities gene expression GK decreased greatly dog WBC. cat WBC significantly higher activities HK PK dog WBC.
