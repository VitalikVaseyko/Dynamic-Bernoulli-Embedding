 aim work study regulation respiration energy fluxes permeabilized oxidative glycolytic skeletal muscle fibers, focusing also role cytoskeletal protein tubulin betaII isotype mitochondrial metabolism organization. analyzing accessibility mitochondrial ADP, using respirometry pyruvate kinase-phosphoenolpyruvate trapping system ADP, show apparent affinity respiration ADP directly linked permeability mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Previous studies shown MOM permeability cardiomyocytes regulated VDAC interaction cytoskeletal protein, betaII tubulin. found oxidative soleus skeletal muscle high apparent Km ADP associated low MOM permeability high expression non-polymerized betaII tubulin. low expression non-polymerized form betaII tubulin glycolytic muscles associated high MOM permeability adenine nucleotides (low apparent Km ADP).
