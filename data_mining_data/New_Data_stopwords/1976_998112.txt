 method proposed, suitable kinetic studies concentrated enzyme preparations, principal features described. method makes possible keep constant concentration substrate(s) product(s) observation time. purpose, increase decrease indicator extinction signal, dependent enzyme velocity, monitored automatic titration performed using suitable titer solution. latter contains equimolar amounts indicator substrate(s). whole system operates similar manner pH-stat devices. technical set-up, model reaction systems practical applications shown. Operation problems possible sources error examined. Finally, main limitations well possible improvements discussed.
