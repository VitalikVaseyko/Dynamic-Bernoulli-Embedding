 Four isozymes pyruvate kinase differentially expressed human tissue. Human pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (hPKM2) expressed early fetal tissues progressively replaced three isozymes, M1, R, L, immediately birth. cancer cells, hPKM2 expressed promote tumor cell proliferation. almost ubiquitous presence cancer cells, hPKM2 designated tumor specific PK-M2, presence human plasma currently used molecular marker diagnosis various cancers. X-ray structure human hPKM2 complexed Mg(2+), K(+), inhibitor oxalate, allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) determined resolution 2.82 A. active site hPKM2 partially closed conformation likely resulting ligand-induced domain closure promoted binding FBP. four subunits enzyme tetramer, conserved water molecule observed 2-si face prospective enolate supports hypothesis proton-relay system acting proton donor reaction (1). Significant structural differences among human M2, rabbit muscle M1, human R isozymes observed, especially orientation FBP-activating loop, closed conformation FBP bound. structural differences observed PK isozymes could potentially exploited unique structural templates design allosteric drugs disease states associated various PK isozymes, especially cancer nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia.
