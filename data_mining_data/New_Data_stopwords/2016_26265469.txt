 widespread second messenger molecule cyclic di-GMP (cdG) regulates transition motile virulent lifestyles sessile, biofilm-forming ones wide range bacteria. Many pathogenic commensal bacterial-host interactions known controlled cdG signaling. Although biochemistry cyclic dinucleotide metabolism well understood, much remains discovered downstream signaling pathways induce bacterial responses upon cdG binding. part ongoing research role cdG signaling plant-associated Pseudomonas species, carried affinity capture screen cdG binding proteins model organism Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. flagella export AAA+ ATPase FliI identified result screen subsequently shown bind specifically cdG molecule, KD low micromolar range. interaction FliI cdG appears widespread. addition FliI homologs diverse bacterial species, high affinity binding also observed type III secretion system homolog HrcN type VI ATPase ClpB2. addition cdG shown inhibit FliI HrcN ATPase activity vitro. Finally, combination site-specific mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, silico analysis used predict cdG binds FliI pocket highly conserved residues interface two FliI subunits. results suggest novel, fundamental role cdG controlling function multiple important bacterial export pathways, direct allosteric control export ATPase proteins.
