 (Z)-3-Chlorophosphoenolpyruvate synthesized reaction 3,3-dichloropyruvic acid trimethylphosphite, followed deesterification. compound competitive inhibitor pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate kinase inactivated upon prolonged incubation compound, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase slowly inactivated (t1/2 = 5 h). compound substrate enzymes, acted upon pyruvate kinase approximately 0.1% rapidly phosphoenolpyruvate itself. case phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, compound converted 3:1 mixture chloropyruvate chlorooxalacetate, overall rate 25% carboxylation rate phosphoenolpyruvate.
