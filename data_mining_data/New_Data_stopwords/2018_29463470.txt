 Protein kinases regulate every aspect cellular activity, whereas metabolic enzymes responsible energy production catabolic anabolic processes. Emerging evidence demonstrates metabolic enzymes, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), ketohexokinase (KHK) isoform (KHK-A), hexokinase (HK), nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 2 (NME1/2), phosphorylate soluble metabolites also function protein kinases phosphorylate variety protein substrates regulate Warburg effect, gene expression, cell cycle progression proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, exosome secretion, cell activation, iron transport, ion channel opening, many fundamental cellular functions. elevated protein kinase functions moonlighting metabolic enzymes tumor development make promising therapeutic targets cancer.
