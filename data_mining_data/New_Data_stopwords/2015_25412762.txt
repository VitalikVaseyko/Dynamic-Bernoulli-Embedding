 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expressed high levels embryonic development tumour progression important cell growth. However, known whether directly controls cell division. Here, found Aurora B phosphorylates PKM2, PKM1, T45; phosphorylation required PKM2's localization interaction myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) contractile ring region mitotic cells cytokinesis. PKM2 phosphorylates MLC2 Y118, primes binding ROCK2 MLC2 subsequent ROCK2-dependent MLC2 S15 phosphorylation. PKM2-regulated MLC2 phosphorylation, greatly enhanced EGF stimulation EGFRvIII, K-Ras G12V B-Raf V600E mutant expression, plays pivotal role cytokinesis, cell proliferation brain tumour development. findings underscore instrumental function PKM2 oncogenic EGFR-, K-Ras- B-Raf-regulated cytokinesis tumorigenesis.
