 Shifting substrate oxidation heart muscle fatty acids glucose (substrate-switch) may improve contractile function heart failure. tested whether application two agents (etomoxir NVP-LAB121) capable inducing substrate-switch reverts onset heart failure rats chronic pressure-overload. Hypertrophy induced aortic banding rats 1 15 weeks. Rats treated 10 days CPT-1-inhibitor etomoxir [29.5 micromol/(kg day)] NVP-LAB121 [60 micromol/(kg day)], pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase-inhibitor, assessment echocardiography perfusion isolated working hearts. also analyzed PDH- CPT1-activity expression alpha- beta-MHC RT-PCR. Aortic banding increased heart-to-body-weight-ratio (g/kg) 3.44 +/- 0.26 4.14 +/- 0.48 1 week 2.80 +/- 0.21 6.54 +/- 0.26 15 weeks. Ejection fraction impaired 15 weeks (57 +/- 11 vs. 73 +/- 8%, P < 0.05) rats exhibited signs heart failure. Total PDH activity groups. CPT-1 activity unchanged 1 week decreased 15 weeks (P < 0.01). Neither etomoxir NVP-LAB121 affected cardiac function vivo, etomoxir improved function isolated heart. drugs affect total PDH CPT-1 activity, increased PDH-activity status, prevented decrease PDK4 expression heart failure, increased alpha beta-MHC expression shifted substrate oxidation toward glucose isolated working rat heart. conclusion, pharmacologic induction substrate-switching associated changes myofibrillar isoform expression reverse heart failure vivo. improvement function vitro deserves investigation.
