 Yeast established efficient model system study biological principles underpinning human health. review focus yeast models covering two aspects cancer formation progression (i) activity pyruvate kinase (PK), recapitulates metabolic features cancer cells, including Warburg effect, (ii) chromosome bridge-induced translocation (BIT) mimiking genome instability cancer. Saccharomyces cerevisiae excellent model study cancer cell metabolism, exponentially growing yeast cells exhibit many metabolic similarities rapidly proliferating cancer cells. metabolic reconfiguration includes increase glucose uptake fermentation, expense respiration oxidative phosphorylation (the Warburg effect), involves broad reconfiguration nucleotide amino acid metabolism. yeast humans, regulation process seems central player, PK, up-regulated cancer, occur mostly post-transcriptional post-translational basis. Furthermore, BIT allows generate selectable translocation-derived recombinants ("translocants"), two desired chromosomal locations, wild-type yeast strains transformed linear DNA cassette carrying selectable marker flanked two DNA sequences homologous different chromosomes. Using BIT system, targeted non-reciprocal translocations mitosis easily inducible. extensive collection different yeast translocants exhibiting genome instability aberrant phenotypes similar cancer cells produced subjected analysis. review, hence provide overview upon two yeast cancer models, extrapolate general principles mimicking human disease mechanisms yeast.
