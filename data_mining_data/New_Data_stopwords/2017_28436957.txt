 Diabetic nephropathy (DN) major cause end-stage renal disease, therapeutic options preventing progression limited. identify novel therapeutic strategies, studied protective factors DN using proteomics glomeruli individuals extreme duration diabetes (l50 years) without DN histologic signs DN. Enzymes glycolytic, sorbitol, methylglyoxal mitochondrial pathways elevated individuals without DN. particular, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression activity upregulated. Mechanistically, showed hyperglycemia diabetes decreased PKM2 tetramer formation activity sulfenylation mouse glomeruli cultured podocytes. Pkm-knockdown immortalized mouse podocytes higher levels toxic glucose metabolites, mitochondrial dysfunction apoptosis. Podocyte-specific Pkm2-knockout (KO) mice diabetes developed worse albuminuria glomerular pathology. Conversely, found pharmacological activation PKM2 small-molecule PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, reversed hyperglycemia-induced elevation toxic glucose metabolites mitochondrial dysfunction, partially increasing glycolytic flux PGC-1alpha mRNA cultured podocytes. intervention studies using DBA2/J Nos3 (eNos) KO mouse models diabetes, TEPP-46 treatment reversed metabolic abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction kidney pathology. Thus, PKM2 activation may protect DN increasing glucose metabolic flux, inhibiting production toxic glucose metabolites inducing mitochondrial biogenesis restore mitochondrial function.
