 PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), critical regulator glycolysis, phosphorylated numerous growth factor receptors oncogenic tyrosine kinases including NPM-ALK expressed subset aggressive T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas known anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-positive. previous work demonstrated phosphorylation Y105-PKM2 NPM-ALK regulates major metabolic shift promote lymphomagenesis. addition role metabolism, recent studies shown PKM2 promotes oncogenesis phosphorylating nuclear STAT3 (signal transducer activator transcription 3) regulating transcription genes involved cell survival proliferation. hypothesized identification novel PKM2 interactors could provide additional insights expanding functional role cancer. end, immunocomplexes FLAG-tagged PKM2 isolated NPM-ALK-positive ALCL (anaplastic large cell lymphoma) cells subjected liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) led identification polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) novel interactor PKM2. interaction PTBP1 PKM2 restricted nucleus dependent NPM-ALK mediated Y105 phosphorylation PKM2. Stable shRNA-mediated silencing PTBP1 resulted marked decrease pY105-PKM2 pY705-STAT3 led decreased ALCL cell proliferation colony formation. Overall, data demonstrate PTBP1 interacts PKM2 promotes ALCL oncogenesis facilitating PKM2-dependent activation STAT3 within nucleus.
