 Compared normal differentiated cells, cancer cells take much glucose metabolize mainly via aerobic glycolysis. metabolic phenotype characterized high expression glucose transporters (Gluts) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) glucose-sensing protein frequently up-regulated cancer cells, however, whether directly implicated glucose metabolism remains elucidated. report upon glucose deficiency, induction GRP78 resulted enhanced HIF-1alpha transcription, accompanied transient increased expression Glut-1. addition, GRP78 likely facilitate membrane translocation Glut-1 via protein-protein interaction. Glucose starvation-stimulated GRP78 also impaired expression PKM2 promoted expression mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA) B (PDHB), resulting metabolic shift glycolysis TCA cycle. Interestingly, inhibition PKM2 GRP78 abrogated glucose supply restored, suggesting GRP78 PKM2 expressions adaptable nutritional levels microenvironment. mechanistic study indicated GRP78 overexpression activated Class III PI3K-mediated autophagy pathway induced autophagic degradation IKKbeta, caused inactivation NF-kappaB pathway subsequently altered expression PKM2 HIF-1alpha. study establishes GRP78 PKM2 crucial molecular links cancer cell glucose metabolism tumor microenvironment alterations.
