 Tumors often characterized hypoxia, vascular abnormalities, low extracellular pH, increased interstitial fluid pressure, altered choline-phospholipid metabolism, aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). impact tumor characteristics investigated extensively context tumor development, progression, treatment response, resulting number non-invasive imaging biomarkers. recent evidence suggests cancer cells undergo metabolic reprograming, beyond aerobic glycolysis, course tumor development progression. resulting altered metabolic content tumors ability affect cell signaling block cellular differentiation. Additional emerging evidence reveals interaction tumor stroma cells alter tumor metabolism (leading metabolic reprograming) well tumor growth vascular features. review summarize previous current preclinical, non-invasive, multimodal imaging efforts characterize tumor microenvironment, including stromal components understand tumor-stroma interaction cancer development, progression, treatment response.
