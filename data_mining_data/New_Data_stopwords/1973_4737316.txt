 paper reports study kinetics reaction phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP Mg(2+) catalysed rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. experimental results indicate reaction mechanism equilibrium random-order type, substrates products phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, Mg(2+), pyruvate MgATP, dead-end complexes, pyruvate, ADP Mg(2+), form randomly exist equilibrium substrate complexes. Values determined Michaelis, dissociation inhibition constants reaction compared values ascertained previous workers.
