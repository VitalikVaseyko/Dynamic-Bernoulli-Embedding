 report effects sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) plus hemoperfusion (HP) (SLED + HP) patients acute severe organophosphate (OP) poisoning (ASOPP). study designed compare therapeutic effectiveness SLED + HP continuous hemofiltration (CHF) plus HP (CHF + HP) patients ASOPP. order assess two treatment methods, 56 patients ASOPP divided CHF + HP group SLED + HP group. biochemical indicators, in-hospital duration, hemodynamic parameters, Acute Physiology, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, survival mortality rates compared. groups treatment, levels serum creatine kinase isozyme MB, creatine kinase, creatinine, glutamic-oxalacetic transaminease, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, APACHE II scores first, second, seventh day decreased (P < 0.05), whereas levels serum acetylcholinesterase increased. two groups showed statistical differences in-hospital duration, biochemical indicators, APACHE II score, hemodynamic parameters, survival rate, mortality rate (P > 0.05). conclusion, SLED similar hemodynamic stability CHF two treatment methods similar effects ASOPP patients. importantly, SLED plus HP relatively economical convenient patients ASOPP clinical practice.
