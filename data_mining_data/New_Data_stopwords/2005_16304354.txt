 Mutations leading red cell enzyme deficiencies associated diverse phenotypes range hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia, polycythemia, neurological developmental abnormalities. mutations occur sporadically, common glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) mutants endemic rarely cause disease. Common G6PD mutants likely reached prevalence provide protection severe malarial complications. review G6PD, pyruvate kinase, 5' nucleotidase, cytochrome b5 reductase deficiencies discussed greater detail. Limitations commonly used screening tests detection disorders also emphasized, well emerging knowledge non-enzymatic function glycolytic enzymes.
