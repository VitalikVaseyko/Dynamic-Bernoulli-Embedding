 study attempted determine whether quantity quality protein intake could influence activity enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, adult rats fed 23 days diet containing different levels (10 70%) qualities (casein, wheat gluten, egg yolk) protein. Variations liver enzyme activities pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), malic enzyme (ME), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) studied. Also changes enzyme activities compared changes food intake body weight gain. Increasing protein level produced progressive fall activities PK. decrease PK activity greater biological value dietary proteins higher (P less 0.05). hand, activities G6PDH PEPCK increased protein level increased. activity G6Pase unchanged. relationship two opposing enzyme activities PK PEPCK, relation protein intake, shows protein studied, equilibrium glycolysis gluconeogenesis obtained different protein intakes (1.5, 1.9, 2.2 g protein/day/100 g body weight, respectively, egg yolk, casein, wheat gluten) regardless daily consumption energy carbohydrate, similar (8 9 kcal/day/100 g body weight). equilibrium also corresponded maximum weight gain (5 g) experimental animals. conclusion, experimental method used permits simultaneous assessment protein carbohydrate requirements ensuring best weight gain young adult rats.
