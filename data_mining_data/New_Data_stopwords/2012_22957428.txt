 BACKGROUND: Plant molluscicides could appropriate snail control measures schistosomiasis endemic areas. OBJECTIVES: present study undertaken evaluate immunological physiological responses Biomphalaria (B.) alexandrina snails effect methanol extract Azadirachta (A.) indica plant. MATERIALS METHODS: Haemolymph samples collected snails treated LC25 methanol extract 1 month untreated snails. collected haemolymph samples treated untreated snails tested plant used flow cytometric analysis cell cycle. RESULTS: obtained results indicated hemolymph samples B. alexandrina snails contained two morphologically distinct types hemocytes, designated Hyalinocyte Granulocyte cells. addition, number snail's hyalinocytes granulocytes mortality rate significantly increased treatment A. indica extract. Phagocytosis group treated tested plant highly significant increased control one indicating highly increase response snail treatment. lipid peroxide glucose levels hemolymph treated snails elevated protein glycogen contents showed decrease soft tissues compared control group. addition, activity level enzymes representing glycolytic enzymes hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),and glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI); glycogenolytic enzymes glycogen phosphorylase, glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase); gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1-6 diphosphatase (F-D-P ase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) also significantly reduced response treatment. CONCLUSIONS: concluded application methanol extracts A. indica plant may helpful snail control interferes snails'immunology physiology.
