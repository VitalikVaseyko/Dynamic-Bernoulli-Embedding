 Glucose-stimulated increases mitochondrial metabolism generally thought important activation insulin secretion. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) key regulatory enzyme, believed govern rate pyruvate entry citrate cycle. show elevated glucose concentrations (16 30 vs 3 mM) cause increase PDH activity isolated rat islets, clonal beta-cell line (MIN6). However, increases PDH activity elicited either dichloroacetate, adenoviral expression catalytic subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, without effect glucose-induced increases mitochondrial pyridine nucleotide levels, cytosolic ATP concentration, MIN6 cells, insulin secretion isolated rat islets. Similarly, parameters unaffected blockade glucose-induced increase PDH activity adenovirus-mediated over-expression PDH kinase (PDK). Thus, activation PDH complex plays unexpectedly minor role stimulating glucose metabolism triggering insulin release.
