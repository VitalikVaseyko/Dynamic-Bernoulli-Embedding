 Ketone bodies used cerebral energy generation situ, availability increased fasting ingestion ketogenic diet. However, known effectively ketone bodies compete glucose, lactate, pyruvate energy generation brain parenchyma. Hence, contributions exogenous 5.0 mM [1-(13)C]glucose 1.0 mM [2-(13)C]lactate + 0.1 mM pyruvate (combined [2-(13)C]lactate + [2-(13)C]pyruvate) acetyl-CoA production measured without 5.0 mM [U-(13)C]3-hydroxybutyrate superfused rat hippocampal slices (13)C NMR non-steady-state isotopomer analysis tissue glutamate GABA. Without [U-(13)C]3-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, combined lactate + pyruvate, unlabeled endogenous sources contributed (mean +/- SEM) 70 +/- 7%, 10 +/- 2%, 20 +/- 8% acetyl-CoA, respectively. [U-(13)C]3-hydroxybutyrate, glucose contributions significantly fell 70 +/- 7% 21 +/- 3% (p < 0.0001), combined lactate + pyruvate endogenous contributions unchanged, [U-(13)C]3-hydroxybutyrate became major acetyl-CoA contributor (68 +/- 3%)--about three-times higher glucose. direct analysis GABA carbon 2 multiplet revealed [U-(13)C]3-hydroxybutyrate contributed approximately acetyl-CoA fraction glucose, indicating less avidly oxidized GABAergic glutamatergic neurons. appearance superfusate lactate derived glycolysis [1-(13)C]glucose decrease significantly presence 3-hydroxybutyrate, hence total glycolytic flux (Krebs cycle inflow + exogenous lactate formation) attenuated 3-hydroxybutyrate. indicates that, conditions, 3-hydroxybutyrate inhibited glycolytic flux upstream pyruvate kinase.
