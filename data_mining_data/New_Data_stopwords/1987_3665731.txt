 studied effect spontaneous long-term (9-10 months) diabetes heart Chinese hamsters (CHAD strain) elucidate relationship diabetes mellitus cardiomyopathy. diabetic hamsters, aged approximately 11 months, showed body weight loss, hyperglycemia (mean fasting plasma glucose 402 mg/dl), hypoinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia ketonemia. diabetic hamsters showed reduced activities cytoplasmic glycolytic key enzymes; hexokinase, pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase, increases cardiac glycogen glucose-6-phosphate contents 40% decrease cardiac ATP content, indicating decreased energy production. accumulation myocardial triglyceride cholesterol found diabetic hamsters. addition, cardiac norepinephrine content increased diabetic hamsters, suggesting presence autonomic nervous disorder. Increased heart weight thickening septum ventricular walls found diabetic hamsters. Light-microscopic analysis revealed 42.9% diabetic hamsters myocardial degeneration without vascular lesion extramural large intramural small vessels, whereas non-diabetic controls myocardial vascular lesions. data suggest diabetic Chinese hamsters cardiomyopathy, possibly caused extravascular factors metabolic autonomic nervous disorder although conclusive evidence lacking.
