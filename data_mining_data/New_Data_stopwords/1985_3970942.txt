 inactivation rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase 0.3 mM 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-1,N6-ethenoadenosine pH 7.8 biphasic. first phase proceeds rapidly yield partially active enzyme (46% residual activity) followed slower rate leads total inactivation. inactivation first phase reversed addition 20 mM dithiothreitol, whereas second phase unaffected. two phases second-order rate constants 250 M-1 X min-1 (dithiothreitol-sensitive reaction) 52 M-1 X min-1 (dithiothreitol-insensitive reaction), respectively. Marked protection inactivation afforded phosphoenolpyruvate metal-nucleotide complexes presence free metal, indicating reaction occurs region active site. Loss approximately two sulfhydryls per enzyme subunit correlates well dithiothreitol-sensitive inactivation, suggesting phase inactivation may attributable disulfide formation. Incorporation one mole fluorescent reagent per enzyme subunit correlates closely dithiothreitol-insensitive phase inactivation, yielding modified histidine residue. quantum yield fluorescent sulfonylbenzoyl-1,N6-ethenoadenosine-pyruvate kinase 0.007, compared 0.54 parent nucleoside 1,N6-ethenoadenosine. quenched fluorescence consistent stacking sulfonylbenzoyl moiety purine ring modified enzyme, suggests altered histidine may located adenine region metal-nucleotide binding site.
