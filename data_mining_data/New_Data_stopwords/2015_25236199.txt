 work describes metalloproteomics study bovine muscle tissue different grades meat tenderness animals Nellore breed (Bos indicus) based protein separation two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, identification calcium ions protein spots X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) characterisation proteins electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Forty (40) specimens selected divided two experimental groups: animals tough meat (TO) animals tender meat (TE). third group (P) Piedmontese breed animals (Bos taurus) included serve comparative model level meat tenderness. procedures efficient preserved metal-protein structure, enabling calcium detection protein spots SR-XRF given molecular weight range 14-97kDa. Two proteins (pyruvate kinase albumin) inferred related phenotypical differences animals different groups.
