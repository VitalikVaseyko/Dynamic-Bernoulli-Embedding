 BACKGROUND: Bacterial signal transduction systems like two component system (TCS) Serine/Threonine kinase (STK) Serine/Threonine phosphatase (STP) play important roles virulence pathogenesis bacterial pathogens. Mycoplasma genitalium, mollicute causes urogenital diseases urethritis cervicitis men women, respectively, pathogen lacks TCS possesses STK/STP. study, investigated biochemical virulence properties STP protein encoded gene MG_207 species. RESULTS: overexpressed MG207 Escherichia coli overexpression system recombinant His10MG207 protein purified affinity chromatography. recombinant protein readily hydrolyzed substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) dose-dependent manner. Additional studies using synthetic peptides substrates revealed recombinant protein able hydrolyze threonine phosphate. Further, transposon insertion mutant strain M. genitalium (TIM207) lacks protein MG207 showed differentially phosphorylated proteins compared wild type G37 strain. Mass spectrometry revealed key proteins differentially phosphorylated TIM207 strain putative cytoskeletal protein encoded gene MG_328 pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha chain encoded gene MG_274. addition, TIM207 noticed less cytotoxic HeLa cells correlated production less hydrogen peroxide strain. strain also less efficient inducing differentiation THP-1 cell line compared wild type M. genitalium. CONCLUSIONS: results study suggest MG207 important signaling protein M. genitalium presence may crucial virulence species.
