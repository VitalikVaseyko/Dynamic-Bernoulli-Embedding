 Potent Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent cell activation endotoxin requires lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) CD14-dependent delivery endotoxin cells containing MD-2 TLR4. used metabolically labeled [(14)C] meningococcal lipooligosaccharide (LOS), purified recombinant endotoxin-binding proteins, cultured endothelial cells better define protein:endotoxin intermediates key cell activation absence functional membrane (m) CD14. Protein:endotoxin complexes aggregates (agg) purified gel sieving characterized immunocapture bio-assays. Cell activation closely correlated LBP, albumin soluble (s) CD14-dependent conversion endotoxin agg (M(r) > = 20 x 10(6)) monomeric (M(r) approximately 55 x 10(3)) endotoxin:sCD14 complexes. Ordered interaction LBP (+ albumin) sCD14 LOSagg required efficient formation bioactive endotoxin:sCD14 complex potent cell activation. Increasing ratio LBP/sCD14 addition bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) reduced accumulation endotoxin:sCD14 complexes instead yielded aggregates endotoxin (M(r) approximately 1-20 x 10(6)) containing LBP BPI taken cells CD14- TLR4-independent manner without inducing pro-inflammatory responses. findings strongly suggest host machinery linked TLR4-dependent cellular activation TLR4-independent cellular clearance endotoxin selectively recognizes different protein:endotoxin complexes. outset infection, low concentrations LBP present absence extracellular BPI favor formation pro-inflammatory endotoxin:CD14 complexes. mobilization LBP BPI triggered inflammation directs endotoxin clearance hence resolution endotoxin-triggered inflammation.
