 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1), key metabolic enzyme involved aerobic glycolysis, highly expressed many solid tumors. Small molecule compound DAP (2,2-dichloroacetophenone) potent inhibitor PDK1. Whether targeting PDK1 DAP inhibit acute myeloid leukemia (AML) works remains unknown. study, evaluated effect inhibition PDK1 DAP cell growth, apoptosis survival AML cells identified underlying mechanisms. found treatment DAP significantly inhibited cell proliferation, increased apoptosis induction suppressed autophagy AML cells vitro, inhibited tumor growth AML mouse model vivo. also showed inhibition PDK1 DAP increased cleavage pro-apoptotic proteins (PARP Caspase 3) decreased expression anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-xL BCL-2) autophagy regulators (ULK1, Beclin-1 Atg). addition, found DAP inhibited PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, demonstrated PDK1 interacted ULK1, BCL-xL E3 ligase CBL-b AML cells, DPA treatment could inhibit interactions. Collectively, results indicated targeting PDK1 DAP inhibited AML cell growth via multiple signaling pathways suggest targeting PDK1 may promising therapeutic strategy AMLs.
