 glycosomes vitro grown procyclic trypomastigote forms Trypanosoma brucei purified three different procedures results compared electron microscopy, enzyme assays sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Centrifugation self-forming Percoll gradient followed sucrose gradient centrifugation resulted least enriched glycosomal preparation. Centrifugation pre-formed Nycodenz gradient gave improved preparation homogeneous preparation intact glycosomes obtained centrifugation two successive sucrose gradients. Glycosomes purified Nycodenz double sucrose gradient procedures appeared larger situ glycosomes presumably due osmotic effect resulting disruption granular matrix organelles. Nevertheless, appears loss cisternal contents due swelling organelles. glycosomes bloodstream form trypomastigotes purified procedures show, however, sign swelling. comparison glycosomes purified procyclic trypomastigotes bloodstream form trypomastigotes prepared double sucrose procedure demonstrated glycosome procyclic trypomastigotes: activities hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructose kinase, aldolase phosphoglycerate kinase diminished 80-100%; activities glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase remain unchanged slightly reduced; appearance four major new proteins, among could phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase malate dehydrogenase. observations basic agreement Hart et al. (Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 12, 25-35, 1984).
