 Evidence reversible process resulting stable activated inactivated states mitochondrial branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex isolated perfused rat heart presented. inactivation process mediated pyruvate infusion, activation (up 18-fold) facilitated branched chain alpha-keto acid substrates. low activity state branched chain complex characteristic freshly excised rat hearts could maintained infusion either pyruvate glucose. Activation complex perfused rat heart achieved slowly substrate-free perfusion, rapid activation accomplished infusion branched chain alpha-keto acids. fully activated enzyme complex resulting branched chain alpha-keto acid infusion subsequently could inactivated maximally infusion pyruvate alone intermediate degrees inactivation could produced certain ratios co-infused pyruvate branched chain alpha-keto acid. alpha-Ketoisocaproate order magnitude effective alpha-keto isovalerate either preventing inactivation stimulating opposing activation process co-infused pyruvate. mitochondrial pyruvate transport inhibitor, alpha-cyanocinnamate, effectively prevented inactivation complex infused pyruvate. Differential changes activation states branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes evident two complexes compared apparently similar flux-inhibited (via octanoate infusion) flux-stimulated (via dichloroacetate infusion) metabolic conditions. differential effect pyruvate concentration activity states two complexes also well-defined. results present study suggest distinct systems regulation activity two multienzyme complexes interest. results argue neither inactivation branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex protein kinase, regulatory properties intramitochondrial protein kinase may similar pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. mechanistic nature suggested novel regulatory system concerned pyruvate-mediated inactivation branched chain alpha-keto acid activation cannot inferred present time.
