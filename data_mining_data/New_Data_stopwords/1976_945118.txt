 pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) reaction, complete enzyme-products complex consists enzyme, pyruvate, ATP, divalent cation, monovalent cation, usually K+. dissociation complex slow permitting reversible enolization pyruvate complex course forward reaction. High concentrations component enzyme-products complex inhibits forward reaction, elevated concentrations monovalent cation decrease net rate product dissociation relative pyruvate enolization. result indicates monovalent cation first component released enzyme-products complex presence inhibiting monovalent cation concentration leads re-formation complete complex, necessary pyruvate enolization. evidence suggests monovalent cation bind release turnover enzyme. data permit conclusion first release monovalent cation exclusive pathway dissociation enzyme-products complex, component released reassociate rapidly enough form complete complex forward reaction. Inhibition components must attributed formation abortive complexes.
