 addition acetyl-CoA carboxylase HMG-CoA reductase, AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylates glycogen synthase, phosphorylase kinase, hormone-sensitive lipase casein. number substrates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, e.g., L-pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, phosphorylated significant rates. Examination sites phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase, hormone-sensitive lipase, glycogen synthase phosphorylase kinase suggests consensus recognition sequence serine residue phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase hydrophobic residue N-terminal side (i.e., -1) least one arginine residue -2, -3 -4. Substrates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase lack hydrophobic residue -1 substrates AMP-activated protein kinase.
