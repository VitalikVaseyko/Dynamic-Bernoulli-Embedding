 Glucose glutamine metabolism two microregions human infiltrating ductile breast cancer, center periphery, studied results compared healthy mammary glands. general, activities glycolytic enzymes phosphate-dependent glutaminase follows: center>periphery>mammary gland. Insulin caused marked increase glucose consumption lactate production incubated slices mammary gland effect microregions tumor. Therefore, human breast cancer presents metabolic microregions.
