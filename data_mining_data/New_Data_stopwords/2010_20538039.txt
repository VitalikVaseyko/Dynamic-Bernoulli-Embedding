 previous studies demonstrated retinoic acid (RA)-induced reduction both, key glycolytic enzyme ENO1 proliferation-promoting c-Myc, resulted decreased vitality invasiveness follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines FTC-133 FTC-238. employing two-dimensional electrophoresis mass spectrometry, identified proteins affected RA treatment. addition previously reported decrease ENO1 expression, found RA led significantly reduced levels glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase isoenzymes M1/M2 (PKM1/M2), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIA), transketolase (TKT), annexin A2 (ANXA2), glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1) peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) compared untreated control. proteins investigated thyroid tissues found significantly up-regulated follicular, papillary undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas compared goiter adenoma tissues. findings identify new target proteins RA-mediated anti-tumor re-differentiation therapies provide novel insights treatments thyroid carcinoma.
