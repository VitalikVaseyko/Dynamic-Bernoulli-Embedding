 Teriparatide, recombinant peptide corresponding amino acids 1-34 human parathyroid hormone (PTH), effective bone anabolic drug decade. However, mechanism whereby PTH stimulates bone formation remains incompletely understood. report cultures osteoblast-lineage cells, PTH stimulates glucose consumption lactate production presence oxygen, hallmark aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect. Experiments radioactively labeled glucose demonstrate PTH suppresses glucose entry tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). Mechanistically, increase aerobic glycolysis secondary insulin-like growth factor (Igf) signaling induced PTH, whereas metabolic effect Igf dependent activation mammalian target rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). Importantly, pharmacological perturbation glycolysis suppresses bone anabolic effect intermittent PTH mouse. Thus, stimulation aerobic glycolysis via Igf signaling contributes bone anabolism response PTH.
