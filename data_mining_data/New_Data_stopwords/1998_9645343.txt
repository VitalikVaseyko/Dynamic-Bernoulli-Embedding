 Preneoplastic liver foci neoplasms different morphological phenotypes induced rats N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM; 120 mg/l drinking water 7 weeks) peroxisome proliferator dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; 0.6% diet 84 weeks). Preneoplastic glycogen storage foci (GSF) occurred mainly upon treatment NNM, amphophilic cell foci (APF) mainly observed rats treated DHEA alone combination NNM. 2 types lesions belong 2 different cellular lineages, glycogenotic/basophilic lineage amphophilic lineage, characterized distinct patterns alterations key enzymes energy metabolism. Whereas GSF enzymes glucose metabolizing pathways modified (increase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, decrease glucose-6-phosphatase), APF mainly demonstrated alterations mitochondrial enzymes (increase cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and, lower extent, peroxisomal enzymes (increase peroxisomal hydratase acyl-CoA oxidase). alterations enzyme expression reflect insulinomimetic effect GSF thyromimetic effect APF. Neoplasms resulting APF show differentiated phenotype arising GSF. suggest different many aspects opposite effects 2 carcinogens key enzymes distinct pathways energy metabolism modulate process neoplastic liver cell transformation result phenotypically different preneoplasias neoplasias reflecting different cellular lineages.
