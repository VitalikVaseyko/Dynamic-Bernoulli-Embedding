 previously found Drosophila melanogaster one deoxyribonucleoside kinase, Dm-dNK, however, capable phosphorylate four natural deoxyribonucleosides. Dm-dNK originally isolated embryonic cell line. wanted study expression Dm-dNK development embryonic cells adult flies found declining Dm-dNK activity development activity adult flies. Surprisingly, extract adult flies exhibited strong inhibitory effect deoxyribonucloside kinase activity. dNK-inhibitor precipitable ammonium sulfate, purified high degree gel-filtration indicated LC-MS/MS analysis. Since inhibitor eluted G-200 gel-filtration size 10-13 kDa, named P12. tested purified fraction specificity towards various enzymes found mammalian bacterial dNKs inhibited, whereas effect hexokinase pyruvate kinases acidic phosphatase. However, tested cyclin B-dependent kinase, found strong inhibitory effect. human Cdk1/CycB S. pombe Cdc2/B-type cyclin purified fraction Superdex 200 inhibited Dm-dNK, also inhibited two protein kinases degree. Furthermore, testing P12 DNA polymerase based assay found 3'-5'-exonuclease part DNA polymerase (Klenow polymerase) activated.
