 effects monovalent ions endogenous pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase activity purified bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex investigated. Activity PDH kinase stimulated 1.9-, 1.95-, 1.65-, 1.4-fold 10 mM K+, Rb+, NH+4, Cs+, respectively, whereas Na+ Li+ effect PDH kinase activity. crystal radii stimulatory ions range 1.33 1.69 crystal radii nonstimulatory ions range 0.6 0.94 A. Stimulation PDH kinase monovalent ions pH dependent. Protein dilution studies showed monovalent ion stimulation measurable within 10 protein addition PDH kinase assays. Furthermore, stimulation occurred protein concentrations tested. ATP concentrations 12.5 25 microM, K+ NH+4 stimulation constant 0 110 0 30 mM, respectively. higher ATP concentrations, 50 500 microM, K+ NH+4 stimulation peaked approximately 30 3 mM, respectively, thereafter declined ion concentration increased. Maximal PDH kinase stimulation K+ NH+4 also declined Na+ increased 0 120 mM, fixed salt concentration 120 mM, K+ NH+4 stimulated PDH kinase activity. Phosphopeptide analysis demonstrated K+ NH+4 stimulated phosphorylation sites 1 2, site 3 phosphorylation relatively constant conditions. Thiamin pyrophosphate 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) blocked monovalent ion stimulation half-maximally 4 6 microM, respectively. However, neither thiamin pyrophosphate 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) significantly inhibited PDH kinase activity absence monovalent ions. results indicate heart PDH kinase stimulation monovalent ions occur changing binding equilibrium PDH dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core. Instead, monovalent ions bind exert regulatory effects near active site PDH kinase.
