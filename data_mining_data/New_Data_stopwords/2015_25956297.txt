 development preimplantation embryo (from fertilisation formation differentiated blastocyst) occurs without requirement exogenous mitogenic survival signals. distinguishes behaviour cells early embryo normal cells. discovery fertilisation triggers production release potent bioactive mediators embryo act back membrane receptors demonstrated presence closed autocrine embryotrophic loops. clear ligands act concert paracrine mediators normally present within reproductive tract support normal development embryo. ligands act via receptors expressed embryo activate signalling transduced 1-o-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase resultant formation phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. polyphosphorylated membrane phospholipid acts docking site proteins possessing PH domain. include PDK1, AKT phospholipase C. activation proteins accounts initiation new transcription embryonic genome form pro-survival, anti-apoptotic transcriptome post-transcriptional activation pro-survival signalling within embryonic cells. includes attenuation action pro-apoptotic signals, P53. production embryotrophic ligands fertilisation bootstraps development activation transcription embryonic genome, followed activation pro-survival settings within embryo cells.
