 OBJECTIVE: determine frequency mutant pyruvate kinase (PK) allele, haematological parameters AB blood types Abyssinian Somali cats Australia. DESIGN: Complete blood cell reticulocyte counts, DNA PK mutation testing blood typing performed cats. RESULTS: total 60 cats (36 Abyssinians, 24 Somalis) included (37 females, 23 males). mutant PK allele, three female Somalis homozygous (affected, 5%), 17 cats heterozygous (carrier, 28%) 40 cats tested negative (normal, 67%). Pedigree analysis revealed common ancestry affected many carrier cats. affected cats, two regenerative anaemias reticulocytosis (range 64-390 x 10(9)/L; P < 0.001 compared normal carrier cats). consistent historical sign lethargy. One affected cat euthanased 18 months testing, anaemia, neutropenia, anorexia weight loss. mutant allele frequency 0.19 overall (0.29 Somalis, 0.13 Abyssinians). cats blood type A. commercial blood typing card method incorrectly identified 12 cats type AB blood. CONCLUSIONS: frequency mutant PK allele high Australia. Screening PK deficiency indicated mating individual cats breeds, even absence anaemia especially reticulocytosis. Although cats present study blood type A, blood type B common breeds worldwide. Retyping AB typed cats laboratory technique recommended.
