 previous reports presented evidence suggesting existence tumor cells second control site glycolysis pyruvate kinase competition adenosine diphosphate enzyme mitochondria, responsible Crabtree effect. Now, using cells partially permeabilized nucleotides phosphorylated substrates, provide evidence supporting existence hepatocytes partial control adenosine triphosphate phosphofructokinase, followed total control adenosine triphosphate pyruvate kinase. partial nonoperation second site Ehrlich ascites tumor cells appears cause characteristic aerobic glycolysis, Crabtree effect, low Pasteur effect cells.
