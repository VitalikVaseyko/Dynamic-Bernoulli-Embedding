 Pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40] various tissues rats separable seven kinds pI-isozymes isoelectric separation Ampholine carrier ampholytes; pI 5.4-isozyme, pI 5.6-isozyme, pI 6.2-isozyme (2 kinds), pI 6.6-isozyme, pI 7.4-isozyme, pI 7.8-isozyme. pI-isozymes contained bound fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP). bound FDP completely dissociated pI-isozymes salted ammonium sulfate. FDP-free form, pyruvate kinase classified three types, liver-type (type L) pI 6.2, muscle-type (type M) pI 7.4, spleen-type (type M2) pI 7.8. liver-type isoenzyme two kinds FDP-binding sites; pI 5.6-isozyme pI 5.4-isozyme obtained one two kinds sites bound FDP, respectively. association dissociation FDP sites reversible presence absence 0.15 KC1 (high ionic strength). muscle-type isoenzyme FDP-binding site. spleen-type isoenzyme two kinds FDP-binding sites, like liver-type isoenzyme. ionic strength solutions containing enzyme FDP sufficiently low, one two kinds sites could bind FDP, converting enzyme pI 6.6-isozyme pI 6.2-isozyme, respectively. FDP bound one kind site (the 2nd site) easily dissociable, FDP bound kind site (the 1st site) not. Provided 1st site carried bound FDP, 2nd site associable high ionic strength. liver-type isoenzyme free FDP spleen-type isoenzyme bound FDP sites similar pI values 6.2 separable isoelectric separation. properties pI-isozymes compared. Rhodamine sarcoma transplanted rats, content spleen-type isoenzyme livers increased. rats injected chromatin prepared either Rhodamine sarcoma spleen, content spleen-type isoenzyme livers increased. observed injection chromatin prepared liver, indicating factor capable controlling gene expression present chromatins sarcoma spleen barely chromatin liver.
