 Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) label-free technique identifying multiplex metabolites determining distribution relative abundance situ. previous study showed N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC) could act matrix laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF MS) detection oligosaccharides solution. present study, NEDC-assisted LDI-TOF MSI yielded many endogenous compound peaks m/z 60 m/z 1600 9-aminoacridine (9-AA). results show NEDC-assisted LDI-TOF MSI especially well-suited examining distributions glycerophospholipids (GPs) addition low molecular weight metabolites m/z 400. Particularly, NEDC matrix allowed LDI-TOF MSI glucose animal tissue. Furthermore, NEDC-assisted LDI-TOF MSI applied mouse model colorectal cancer liver metastasis. revealed distinct spatio-molecular signatures many detected compounds tumor tumor-bearing liver, found taurine, glucose, GPs decreased tumor-bearing liver tumor developed liver. Importantly, also found glucose gradient metastatic tumor foci first time, confirms energy competition tumors liver remnant due Warburg effect. results suggest NEDC-assisted LDI MSI provides situ label-free analysis multiple glycerophospholipids low molecular weight metabolites (including glucose) abundant peaks high spatial resolution. allow future application situ definition biomarkers, signaling pathways, disease mechanisms.
