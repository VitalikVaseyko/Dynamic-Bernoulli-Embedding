 Elevated plasma free fatty acids cause insulin resistance skeletal muscle activation chronic inflammatory process. process involves nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation result diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation subsequent protein kinase Ctheta (PKCtheta) phosphorylation. present, unknown whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARdelta) activation prevents fatty acid-induced inflammation insulin resistance skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, PPARdelta agonist GW501516 prevented phosphorylation insulin receptor substrate-1 Ser(307) inhibition insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation caused exposure saturated fatty acid palmitate. latter effect reversed PPARdelta antagonist GSK0660. Treatment PPARdelta agonist enhanced expression two well known PPARdelta target genes involved fatty acid oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 increased phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase, preventing reduction fatty acid oxidation caused palmitate exposure. agreement changes, GW501516 treatment reversed increase DAG PKCtheta activation caused palmitate. effects abolished presence carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 inhibitor etomoxir, thereby indicating increased fatty acid oxidation involved changes observed. Consistent findings, PPARdelta activation GW501516 blocked palmitate-induced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. Likewise, drug treatment inhibited increase IL-6 expression caused palmitate C2C12 human skeletal muscle cells well protein secretion cytokine. findings indicate PPARdelta attenuates fatty acid-induced NF-kappaB activation subsequent development insulin resistance skeletal muscle cells reducing DAG accumulation. results point PPARdelta activation pharmacological target prevent insulin resistance.
