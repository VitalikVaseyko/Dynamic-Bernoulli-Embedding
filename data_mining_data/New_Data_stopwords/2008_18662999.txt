 phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt pathway regulates various cellular functions, especially cell survival cell cycle progression. contrast survival pathways, reports scaffold proteins regulate signaling cascade specificity pathway. identify 5' repressor element dual-repression binding protein 1 (Freud-1)/Akt kinase-interacting protein 1 (Aki1) novel scaffold PDK1/Akt pathway. Freud-1/Aki1 (also known CC2D1A) expression induced formation PDK1/Akt complex regulated Akt activation concentration-dependent biphasic manner. Freud-1/Aki1 also associated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor response EGF stimulation required Akt activation induced EGF, insulin-like growth factor 1. Freud-1/Aki1 gene silencing decreased Akt kinase activity, resulting induction apoptosis increased sensitivity toward chemotherapeutic agents. results suggest Freud-1/Aki1 novel receptor-selective scaffold protein PDK1/Akt pathway present new activation mechanism Akt.
