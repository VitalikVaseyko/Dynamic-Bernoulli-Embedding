 sequence inactivation five bovine erythrocyte enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase aldolase) compared vivo aging red blood cell treatment cells heat, gamma-radiation enzymatic source superoxide radical anion. Amounts oxygen free radicals comparable formed physiologically cells able induce considerable inactivation enzymes; case physiological sequence inactivation reproduced. results seem argue multifactorial inactivation red cell enzymes intravascular aging erythrocyte.
