 study investigated effects long-term heat exposure Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) hybrids (P. olivaceus female symbol x summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus male symbol). 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C, temperature increased 1 +/- 0.5 degrees C day kept temperature 5 days next rise. Cumulative survival rate (CSR), cumulative survival rate different temperature (CSR-T), histological alteration, related enzyme activities investigated. P. olivaceus, mass mortality occurred 29 32 degrees C (the CSR-T dropped 42.39%), serious gill damages appeared 30 32 degrees C. Meanwhile, activities superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), lysozyme (LZM), pyruvate kinase (PK) declined around 29 32 degrees C (except CAT). comparison P. olivaceus, CSR hybrids higher, gill kept better structural integrity, activities SOD, CAT, LZM, PK showed tiny fluctuations. results suggested process chronic heat stress, P. olivaceus seemed sensitive 29 32 degrees C, manifestations survival, histology, enzyme activity generally consistent. hybrids, comparatively insensitivity high temperature might imply better heat tolerance.
