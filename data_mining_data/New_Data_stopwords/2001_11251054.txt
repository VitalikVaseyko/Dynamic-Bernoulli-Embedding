 1. effects creatine phosphate (CP) inorganic phosphate (Pi) sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ regulation investigated mechanically skinned muscle fibres rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles. Changes [Ca2+] detected using fura-2 fluorescence, continuous perfusion solution surrounding preparation restricted approximately 6 microl stopping perfusion. 2. solutions 5 mM ATP 10 mM CP, stopping flow 2-3 min effect [Ca2+] within bath. suggests SR Ca2+ uptake balanced efflux conditions. 3. solutions CP, introduction Pi induced small transient rise [Ca2+], due Ca2+ loss SR. Following equilibration solutions containing Pi (> = 5 mM), maintained decrease [Ca2+] occurred flow stopped. consistent calcium phosphate (Ca-Pi) precipitation within SR, resulting maintained Ca2+ uptake. 4. absence CP, [Ca2+] within bath increased progressively flow stopped. rise [Ca2+] inhibited alternative ATP regenerating system comprising phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate kinase (PK). Therefore, loss Ca2+ SR may result local ADP accumulation consequent reversal SR Ca2+ pump. 5. absence CP, initial Ca2+ release associated introduction Pi increased markedly. Following prolonged equilibration solutions containing Pi, rise [Ca2+] occurred within bath flow stopped. Maintained Ca2+ uptake associated Ca-Pi precipitation apparent level Pi tested (1-60 mM), CP absent. 6. results suggest withdrawal CP associated activation SR Ca2+ efflux pathway. may involve reversal SR Ca2+ pump, due local ADP accumulation. absence CP, dominant influence Pi appears involve Ca2+ efflux via SR Ca2+ pump. possible relevance effects skeletal muscle fatigue considered.
