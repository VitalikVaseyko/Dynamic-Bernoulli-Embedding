 CONTEXT: Differentiation (decidualization) endometrial stromal cells (ESC) essential prerequisite successful implantation establishment pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: aim determine whether orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha, NR3B1), target genes, medium chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD, ACADM), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PEPCK, PCK2), play role decidualization process. SETTING: conducted study University Research Institute. PATIENTS METHODS: Endometrial tissues collected women regular menstrual cycles; tissues used recovery primary ESC RNA extraction fixed immunohistochemistry. Primary ESC decidualized vitro; cells treated XCT790 (ERRalpha inverse agonist). RESULTS: Decidualization ESC vitro associated significant increase expression transcripts encoding ERRalpha coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha. Expression ERRalpha target genes altered increased expression MCAD PDK4 reduced expression PEPCK. Incubation decidualized ESC XCT790 reduced expression ERRalpha markers decidualization IGFBP-1. CONCLUSION: Increased expression ERRalpha may play role altering bioenergetics decidualized ESC preparation implantation embryo successful establishment early pregnancy.
