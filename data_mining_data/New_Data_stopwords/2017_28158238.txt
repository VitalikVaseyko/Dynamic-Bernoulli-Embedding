 Transcriptome sequencing could facilitate discovery sex-biased genes, biological pathways molecular markers, could help clarify molecular mechanism sex determination sexual dimorphism, assist selective breeding aquaculture. Yellow perch unique gonad system sexual dimorphism alternative model study mechanism sex determination, sexual dimorphism sexual selection. study, performed de novo assembly yellow perch gonads muscle transcriptomes high throughput Illumina sequencing. total 212,180 contigs obtained, ranging 127 64,876 bp, N50 1,066 bp. assembly RNA-Seq contigs (>/=200bp) used subsequent analyses, including annotation, pathway analysis, microsatellites discovery. female- pseudo-male-biased genes involved pathways male-biased genes involved 29 pathways, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction enzyme trypsin (enzyme code, EC: 3.4.21.4) highly involved. Pyruvate kinase (enzyme code, EC: 2.7.1.40), plays important roles cell proliferation, highly expressed muscles. addition, total 183,939 SNPs, 11,286 InDels 41,479 microsatellites identified. study first report transcriptome information Percids, provides rich resources conducting studies understanding molecular basis sex determinations, sexual dimorphism, sexual selection fish, population studies marker-assisted selection Percids.
