 Glycolysis ubiquitous pathway thought essential production oil developing seeds Arabidopsis thaliana oil crops. Compartmentation primary metabolism developing embryos poses significant challenge testing hypothesis engineering seed biomass production. also raises question whether preferred route carbon imported photosynthate seed oil embryo. Plastidic pyruvate kinase catalyzes highly regulated, ATP-producing reaction glycolysis. Arabidopsis genome encodes 14 putative isoforms pyruvate kinases. Three genes encode subunits alpha, beta(1), beta(2) plastidic pyruvate kinase. plastid enzyme prevalent developing seeds likely subunit composition 4alpha4beta(1), active pH 8.0, inhibited Glu. Disruption gene encoding beta(1) subunit causes reduction plastidic pyruvate kinase activity 60% reduction seed oil content. seed oil phenotype fully restored expression beta(1) subunit-encoding cDNA partially beta(2) subunit-encoding cDNA. Therefore, identified pyruvate kinase catalyzes crucial step conversion photosynthate oil, suggesting preferred plastid route substrate phosphoenolpyruvate fatty acids.
