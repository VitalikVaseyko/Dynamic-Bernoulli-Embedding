 stated Otto Warburg nearly century ago, cancer metabolic disease, fermentation caused malfunctioning mitochondria, resulting increased anabolism decreased catabolism. Treatment should, therefore, aim restoring energy yield. decrease anabolism, glucose uptake reduced (ketogenic diet). increase catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation restored. Treatment combination alpha-lipoic acid hydroxycitrate shown effective multiple animal models. treatment, combination conventional chemotherapy, yielded extremely encouraging results glioblastoma, brain metastasis lung cancer. Randomized trials necessary confirm preliminary data. major limitation fact combination alpha-lipoic acid hydroxycitrate effective mitochondria still present and/or functional. may case aggressive tumors. increased intracellular alkalosis strong mitogenic signal, bypasses inhibitory signals. Concomitant correction alkalosis may effective treatment case mitochondrial failure.
