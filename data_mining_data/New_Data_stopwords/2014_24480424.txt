 Low birth weight (LBW) exerts persistent effects growth development offspring. present study conducted test hypothesis LBW alters response pigs high-fat (HF) diet-induced changes meat quality skeletal muscle proteome. Normal-birth weight (NBW) LBW piglets fed control diet HF diet weaning slaughter 110 kg body weight. meat quality traits influenced LBW. Meat quality analysis revealed LBW piglets greater ability deposit intramuscular lipids heavier littermates fed HF diet. Increased shear force, lower pH45 min drip loss observed skeletal muscle LBW piglets compared NBW piglets. Proteomic analysis revealed forty-six differentially expressed proteins skeletal muscle LBW NBW piglets fed control diet HF diet. proteins play central role cell structure motility, glucose energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, cellular apoptosis, well stress response. particular interest finding LBW altered response HF diet-induced changes expression proteins related stress response (heat shock protein) glucose energy metabolism (pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase triosephosphate isomerase). Taken together, findings revealed HF diet-induced changes expression glucose energy metabolism-related proteins varied NBW LBW piglets, provides possible mechanism explain higher intramuscular fat store LBW pigs fed HF diet.
