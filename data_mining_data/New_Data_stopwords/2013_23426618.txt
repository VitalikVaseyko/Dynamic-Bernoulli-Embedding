 CONTEXT: widely believed glucocorticoids cause insulin resistance tissues. previously demonstrated glucocorticoids cause insulin sensitization human adipose tissue vitro induce insulin resistance skeletal muscle. OBJECTIVE: aim determine whether glucocorticoids tissue-specific effects insulin sensitivity vivo. DESIGN: Fifteen healthy volunteers recruited double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, receiving overnight hydrocortisone saline infusion. tissue-specific actions insulin determined using paired 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps incorporating stable isotopes concomitant adipose tissue microdialysis. SETTING: study performed Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: sensitivity sc adipose tissue insulin action measured. RESULTS: Hydrocortisone induced systemic insulin resistance failed cause sc adipose tissue insulin resistance measured suppression adipose tissue lipolysis enhanced insulin-stimulated pyruvate generation. primary cultures human hepatocytes, glucocorticoids increased insulin-stimulated p-ser473akt/protein kinase B. Similarly, glucocorticoids enhanced insulin-stimulated p-ser473akt/protein kinase B increased Insulin receptor substrate 2 mRNA expression sc, omental, intact human adipocytes, suggesting depot-specificity action. CONCLUSIONS: study represents first description sc adipose insulin sensitization glucocorticoids vivo demonstrates tissue-specific actions glucocorticoids modify insulin action. defines important advance understanding actions endogenous exogenous glucocorticoids may implications development targeting future glucocorticoid therapies.
