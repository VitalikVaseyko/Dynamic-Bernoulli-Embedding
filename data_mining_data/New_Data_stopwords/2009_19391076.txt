 Pheochromocytomas paragangliomas catecholamine-secreting tumors neural crest origin caused germline mutations least six distinct genes. genetic heterogeneity provided rich source discovery functional characterization new tumor-related genes. However, genetic repertoire tumors still fully known, current evidence points existence additional pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes. Here, unique contributions three hereditary models pheochromocytoma advance knowledge disease pathogenesis presented. first model, loss succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) function, illustrates SDHB, C, mutations, components energy metabolism pathway, serve unique system explore pervasive metabolic shift cancer cells towards glycolysis source energy (also known Warburg effect) contrast characteristic oxidative phosphorylation normal cells. second model, mechanisms tumorigenesis distinct classical pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes discussed context novel putative suppressor neural crest-derived tumors, KIF1B beta gene. Finally, NF1 loss highlighted valuable study model investigate cell lineage selectivity Egln3-mediated developmental apoptotic defect chromaffin precursor cells. Results studies may offer clues understand tissue specificity hereditary pheochromocytoma syndromes. distinct hereditary disease models illustrate genetic-driven progress potential narrow current gaps knowledge pheochromocytoma paraganglioma pathogenesis.
