 1. Measurements made hepatic metabolites normal thyroidectomized rats enzymes glycolytic route, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle lipogenesis together flux glucose alternative pathways glucose metabolism lipid. 2. significant fall content ADP, AMP, citrate, long-chain acyl-CoA derivatives rise 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate following thyroidectomy. observed changes glycolytic intermediates may correlated increased activity phosphofructokinase relative pyruvate kinase fructose bisphosphatase. 3. NAD+/NADH quotient mitochondrial compartment, calculated reactants Keq 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, becomes significantly oxidized hypothyroid animals. redox state cytosolic NAD NADP couples remains relatively unchanged. 4. changes hepatic content CoA derivatives citrate mitochondrial redox state interpreted indicating depressed rate lipid oxidation. 5. Calculations compartmentation metabolites cytosol mitochondria indicate marked decrease mitochondrial citrate, 2-oxoglutarate glutamate smaller changes aspartate malate. changes interpreted providing evidence importance modifications malate-aspartate shuttle hypothyroidism; supported measured changes distribution activities component enzymes hydrogen shuttles. 6. diminished activity glucokinase enzymes glycolytic pathway phosphofructokinase livers hypothyroid rats. oxidative enzymes pentose phosphate pathway, ATP-citrate lyase, 'malic' enzyme fatty acid synthetase also decrease markedly. striking parallelism changes enzyme profile liver adipose tissue hypothyroidism. 7. Adrenal glands hypothyroid rats showed generalized delcine enzyme activity parallel fall tissue weight. Cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase decreased sharply. 8. present results discussed relation data literature increased activities cyclic AMP cyclic GMP phosphodiesterases hypothyroidism, observations integrate relationships anabolic catabolic pathways carbohydrate lipid metabolism alterations hormone sensitivity hypothyroidism.
