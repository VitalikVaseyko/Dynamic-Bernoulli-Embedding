 According cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, aggressive growth early metastasis pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) due activity CSCs, targeted current therapies. Otto Warburg suggested growth cancer cells driven high glucose metabolism. Here, investigated whether glycolysis inhibition targets CSCs thus may enhance therapeutic efficacy. Four established 3 primary PDA cell lines, non-malignant cells, 3 patient-tumor-derived CSC-enriched spheroidal cultures analyzed glucose turnover measurements, MTT ATP assays, flow cytometry ALDH1 activity annexin positivity, colony spheroid formation, western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, xenotransplantation, immunohistochemistry. effect siRNA-mediated inhibition LDH-A LDH-B also investigated. PDA cells exhibited high glucose metabolism, glucose withdrawal LDH inhibition siRNA prevented growth colony formation. Treatment anti-glycolytic agent 3-bromopyruvate almost completely blocked cell viability, self-renewal potential, NF-kappaB binding activity, stem cell-related signaling reverted gemcitabine resistance. 3-bromopyruvate less effective weakly malignant PDA cells affect non-malignant cells, predicting minimal side effects. 3-bromopyruvate inhibited vivo tumor engraftment growth chicken eggs mice enhanced efficacy gemcitabine influencing expression markers proliferation, apoptosis, self-renewal, metastasis. importantly, primary CSC-enriched spheroidal cultures eliminated 3-bromopyruvate. findings propose CSCs may specifically dependent high glucose turnover suggest 3-bromopyruvate therapeutic intervention.
