 Many tumor cells characterized dysregulated glucose metabolism associated increased glycolysis presence oxygen ("Warburg Effect"). Here, analyzed first time possible link glucose metabolism immune cell infiltration renal cell carcinoma (RCC). RCC specimens revealed highly significant increase expression lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) glucose-transporter 1 (GLUT-1) compared corresponding normal kidney tissue mRNA level. Accordingly, tumor cell lines different origin RCC, melanoma hepatocellular carcinoma strongly expressed LDHA GLUT-1 compared nonmalignant counterparts. line finding, tumor cells secreted high amounts lactate. High expression GLUT-1 LDH5, tetramer 4 LDHA subunits, confirmed tissue microarray analysis 249 RCC specimens. Overall, 55/79 (69.6%) 46/71 (64.7%) cases clear cell carcinoma showed constitutive, heterogeneous expression GLUT-1 LDH5, respectively. number CD3(+), CD8(+) FOXP3(+) cells significantly elevated RCC lesions compared normal kidney epithelium, effector molecules granzyme B perforin decreased tumor infiltrating cells. interest, analysis revealed inverse correlation GLUT-1 expression number CD8(+) cells RCC lesions. Together, data suggest accelerated glucose metabolism RCC tissue associated low infiltration CD8(+) effector cells. Targeting glucose metabolism may represent interesting tool improve efficacy specific immunotherapeutic approaches RCC.
