 effects endotoxin administration glycolytic tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates dog livers studied. Changes metabolite concentrations expressed graphically percentages controls using "crossover" plots order identify transitory rate-controlling steps. results show endotoxin administration increased glycolytic flux pyruvate kinase, inhibited gluconeogenic flux phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, decreased glycogen storage, shifted cytosolic mitochondrial redox state relatively oxidized reduced state, decreased extra- intramitochondrial malate-aspartate glutamate-alpha-ketoglutarate shuttle activities, depleted ATP, ADP, NADP concentrations, decreased energy charge. Based data, concluded pyruvate kinase plays major role control glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase major controlling step regulation gluconeogenesis dog livers endotoxic shock. addition, major factor regulation metabolic pathways produce utilize high-energy phosphates livers impaired endotoxic shock.
