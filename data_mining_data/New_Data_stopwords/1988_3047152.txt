 soluble cytoplasmic protein pyruvate kinase (PK) expressed cell surface membrane-anchored form (APK). hybrid protein contains NH2-terminal signal/anchor domain class II integral membrane protein (hemagglutinin/neuraminidase, paramyxovirus SV5) fused PK NH2 terminus. APK contains cryptic site used N-linked glycosylation elimination site site-specific mutagenesis prevent cell surface localization. Truncated forms APK molecule, 80% PK region APK removed, also expressed cell surface. data suggest neither complete PK molecule glycosylation necessary intracellular transport PK cell surface, possible specific signals may needed ectodomain hybrid protein specify cell surface localization.
