 recently isolated strain L21-Fru-AB(T) represents moderately halophilic, obligately anaerobic saccharolytic bacteria thrive suboxic transition zones hypersaline microbial mats. Phylogenetic analyses based 16S rRNA genes, RpoB proteins gene content indicated strain L21-Fru-AB(T) represents novel species genus affiliated distinct phylum-level lineage originally designated Verrucomicrobia subdivision 5. survey environmental 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed members newly recognized phylum wide-spread ecologically important various anoxic environments ranging hypersaline sediments wastewater intestine animals. Characteristic phenotypic traits novel strain included formation extracellular polymeric substances, Gram-negative cell wall containing peptidoglycan absence odd-numbered cellular fatty acids. Unusual metabolic features deduced analysis genome sequence production sucrose osmoprotectant, atypical glycolytic pathway lacking pyruvate kinase synthesis isoprenoids via mevalonate. basis analyses phenotypic, genomic environmental data, proposed strain L21-Fru-AB(T) related bacteria specifically adapted utilization sulfated glycopolymers produced microbial mats biofilms.
