 structural stability rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase examined. unfolding pyruvate kinase induced guanidine hydrochloride, process monitored spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence UV absorption) hydrodynamic measurements (sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium, densimetry, viscometry). spectroscopic techniques revealed unfolding pyruvate kinase induced guanidine hydrochloride simple cooperative process. suggests different regions pyruvate kinase unfolding different efficiencies response denaturant. regions likely related domain structures observed x-ray crystallography. presence L-phenylalanine, allosteric inhibitor, denaturation process became cooperative, enzyme dissociated unfolded higher denaturant concentration. binding phenylalanine also induced structural change enzyme, rendering susceptible tryptic digestion. One peptides, production rate increased, isolated sequenced. N terminus located interface two domains, one contains active site. evidence indicates structural changes, probably involving domain-domain interaction, pyruvate kinase response phenylalanine binding.
