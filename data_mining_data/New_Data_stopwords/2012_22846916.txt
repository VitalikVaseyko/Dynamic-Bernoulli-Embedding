 phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) node important carbon distribution point central metabolic networks; therefore, modification common strategy employed developing microbial production strains. study, mutants Bacillus subtilis 168 generated deletions pykA (which encodes pyruvate kinase), ptsG (which encodes glucose-specific IICBA(Glc) component) ptsGHI operon [which encodes IICBA(Glc), HPr protein enzyme PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS)]. modifications caused reduction initial rate [(14)C]-glucose import, corresponding 10.99, 2.83 0.50% found B. subtilis 168 strains inactive pykA, ptsG ptsGHI genes, respectively. Characterization derivative strains lacking 3-dehydroquinate synthase activity showed inactivation pykA leads 8-fold increase carbon flow common aromatic pathway. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses 76 genes several functional classes revealed carbon starvation transcriptional pattern includes partial gluconeogenic response overexpression genes encoding non-PTS glucose importers strains lacking functional pykA, ptsG ptsGHI genes. transcriptional response consistent pyruvate limitation also detected, includes upregulation genes encoding malic enzymes generate pyruvate malate.
