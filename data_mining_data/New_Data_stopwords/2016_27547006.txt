 Metastasis-associated colon cancer-1 (MACC1) oncogene first identified colon cancer. upstream downstream MACC1 form delicate regulatory network supports tumorigenic role cancers. Multiple functions MACC1 discovered many cancers. gastric cancer (GC), MACC1 shown involved oncogenesis tumor progression. MACC1 overexpression adversely affects clinical outcomes GC patients. Regarding mechanism action MACC1 GC, studies shown promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accelerates cancer metastasis. MACC1 involved many hallmarks GC addition metastasis. MACC1 promotes vasculogenic mimicry (VM) via TWIST1/2, VM increases tumor blood supply, necessary tumor progression. MACC1 also facilitates GC lymphangiogenesis upregulating extracellular secretion VEGF-C/D, indicating MACC1 may important player GC lymphatic dissemination. Additionally, MACC1 supports GC growth metabolic stress enhancing Warburg effect. conclusion, MACC1 participates multiple biological processes inside outside GC cells, making important mediator tumor microenvironment.
