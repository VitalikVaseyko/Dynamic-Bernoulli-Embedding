 known theoretical work simple enzyme systems may exhibit non-linear dynamic properties like found vivo. realize system experimentally, ATP-producing reaction (pyruvate kinase) coupled ATP-consuming reaction (phosphofructokinase). substrate-stat technique adapted characterize single enzyme well follow one enzyme coupled system. plots pyruvate kinase activity versus [ADP] phosphofructokinase activity versus [ATP] hyperbolic, coupled system approaches unique steady state predicted single characteristics. assay conditions phosphofructokinase inhibited ATP, characteristics found single assay coupled system different. system ATP-inhibited phosphofructokinase, paradoxical behaviour predicted demonstrated experimentally. total pyruvate kinase activity increased certain limit, system switched low [ATP], high-activity steady state high [ATP] low-activity steady state.
