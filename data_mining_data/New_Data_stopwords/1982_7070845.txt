Phosphorylase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase catalyse non-equilibrium reactions patterns activity pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinase malic enzyme similar three organisms. levels tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates E.g.H., E.g.S. E.m. order reported tissues active cycle. complete sequence cycle enzymes substantial differences three parasites regard activity individual enzymes. activities NAD NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases significantly lower E.g.H. E.g.S. particularly E.m. suggests tricarboxylic acid cycle may play important role carbohydrate metabolism energy production latter parasites. Nevertheless, three organisms utilize fermentative pathways alternative energy production, fix carbon dioxide via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase partial reversed tricarboxylic acid cycle. speculated vivo carbon channelled towards oxaloacetate pyruvate phosphonenolpyruvate branch point. steady state content ATP ATP/AMP ratios low three organisms, suggesting low rate ATP utilization each.
