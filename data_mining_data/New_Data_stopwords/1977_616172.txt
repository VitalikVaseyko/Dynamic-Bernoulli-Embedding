 effect thyroid hormone renin productiona release rat kidney slices studied. Rat kidney slices incubated Warburg flasks containing Krebs-Ringer-Phosphate- Glucose- Dextran solution 37 C 5 hours. Renin content, renin released incubation media oxygen consumption measured. Kidney slices actively secreted renin. Kidney slices hyperthyroid rats released renin, kidney slices hypothyroid rats released less renin normal kidneys (p less 0.001). addition 1-thyroxine incubation medium increased significantly (p less 0.001) renin release kidney slices normal hypothyroid rats. Thyroid hormone affects renin release mechanism independent ouabain-sensitive sodium pump protein synthesis, since ouabain cycloheximide modify renin release production. results study suggest thyroid hormone plays role renin release juxtaglomerular cells.
