 UNLABELLED: Whether dietary fiber protects colorectal cancer controversial conflicting results human epidemiologic studies. However, studies mouse models colorectal cancer controlled composition gut microbiota, ferment fiber short-chain fatty acids butyrate. Butyrate noteworthy energetic epigenetic functions colonocytes tumor-suppressive properties colorectal cancer cell lines. used gnotobiotic mouse models colonized wild-type mutant strains butyrate-producing bacterium demonstrate fiber potent tumor-suppressive effect microbiota- butyrate-dependent manner. Furthermore, due Warburg effect, butyrate metabolized less tumors accumulated functioned histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor stimulate histone acetylation affect apoptosis cell proliferation. support relevance mechanism human cancer, demonstrate butyrate histone-acetylation levels elevated colorectal adenocarcinomas compared normal colonic tissues. SIGNIFICANCE: results, link diet microbiota tumor-suppressive metabolite, provide insight conflicting epidemiologic findings suggest probiotic/prebiotic strategies modulate endogenous HDAC inhibitor anticancer chemoprevention without adverse effects associated synthetic HDAC inhibitors used chemotherapy.
