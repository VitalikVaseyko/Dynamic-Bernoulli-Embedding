 mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) down-regulated phosphorylation catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms 1-4. Overexpression PDK isoforms therefore reduced PDC activity prevails cancer diabetes. present study, investigated role invariant C-terminal DW-motif inhibition human PDK2 dichloroacetate (DCA). Substitutions made DW-motif (Asp-382 Trp-383) interacting residues (Tyr-145 Arg-149) subunit PDK2 homodimer. Single double mutants show 20-60% residual activities stimulated PDC core. R149A Y145F/R149A mutants show drastic increases apparent IC(50) values DCA, whereas binding affinities DCA comparable wild-type PDK2. R149A Y145F variants exhibit increased similar affinities ADP ATP, mimicking effects DCA. R149A DW-motif mutations (D382A/W383A) forestall binding lipoyl domain PDC mutants, analogous wild-type PDK2 presence DCA ADP. contrast, binding dihydrolipoamide mimetic AZD7545 largely unaffected PDK2 variants. results illuminate pivotal role DW-motif mediating communications DCA-, nucleotide-, lipoyl domain-binding sites. signaling network locks PDK2 inactive closed conformation, equilibrium active open conformation without DCA ADP. results implicate DW-motif anchoring site drug target inhibition aberrant PDK activity cancer diabetes.
