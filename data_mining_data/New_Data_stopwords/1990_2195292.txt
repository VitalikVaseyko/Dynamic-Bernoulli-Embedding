 Metabolic changes rats fed low protein diet investigated 3 weeks weaning using lactalbumin (LP) dietary protein source. energy intake higher weight gain lower rats fed low protein diet (6%, LP group) control rats (13% lactalbumin, C group). Low protein diet induced changes plasma glucose, free fatty acids, triacylglycerol concentrations; however, plasma protein urea concentrations lower LP C rats. Plasma free T3 higher LP C rats (+38%, day 21) insulin progressively decreased experimental period (-56%, day 21) without change glucagon. Liver glycogen triacylglycerol concentrations (+40% +180%, respectively, day 21), cytosolic mitochondrial redox states increased (+100% +100%, day 21), protein concentration decreased (-15%, day 21). Pyruvate kinase (PK) malic enzyme activities higher LP C rats throughout experiment (+80% +210%, respectively, day 21), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity progressively decreased (-65%, day 21). Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity increased 2 weeks LP diet (+35%, day 21) fatty acid synthetase (FAS) activity increased first week diet (+100%, day 7). hormonal metabolic changes appeared associated development futile energy-wasting cycle pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate.
