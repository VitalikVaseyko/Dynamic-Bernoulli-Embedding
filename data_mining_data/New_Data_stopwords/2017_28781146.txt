 Diabetic heart pathology serious social impact due high prevalence worldwide significant mortality/invalidation diabetic patients suffered cardiomyopathy. pathogenesis diabetic diabetes-related cardiomyopathy associated progressive loss impairment cardiac function due adverse effects metabolic, prooxidant, proinflammatory, pro-apoptotic stress factors. adult heart, transcriptional factor forkhead box-1 (FOXO-1) involved maintaining cardiomyocytes homeostatic state induction adaptation metabolic pro-oxidant stress stimuli. Insulin inhibits cardiac FOXO-1 expression/activity IRS1/Akt signaling order prevent gluconeogenesis. diabetes insulin resistance, insulin production insulin-dependent signaling weakened absent. Indeed, FOXO-1 becomes overproduced/overactivated response stress stimuli. diabetic cardiac tissue, FOXO-1 overactivity induces metabolic switch glucose uptake predominant lipid uptake. FOXO-1 limits mitochondrial glucose oxidation stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) increases lipid uptake up-regulation surface expression CD36. cardiac muscle cells, lipid accumulation leads lipotoxicity via increased lipid oxidation, oxidative stress, cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Indeed, cardiac FOXO-1 levels activity strictly regulated. FOXO-1 deregulation (that observed diabetic heart) causes detrimental effects finally lead heart failure.
