 Ethyl pyruvate (EP), simple ester pyruvic acid, shown exert robust neuroprotection various neuropathological conditions, as, cerebral ischemia KA-induced seizure animal models. neuroprotective effect EP attributable anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic effects. present study, investigated convergence anti-inflammatory anti-oxidative functions EP present novel molecular mechanism underlying anti-inflammatory effects EP, conveyed p300, transcriptional co-activator Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) p65. BV2 cells, microglia cell line, EP induced translocation Nrf2 cytosol nucleus enhanced expression hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1) dose-dependent manner 1h incubation 10mM EP increased HO-1 4.9-fold. Nrf2 found translocate cytosol nucleus beginning 30 min EP-treatment binds antioxidant response element (ARE) located HO-1 promoter. Interestingly, LPS-induced inducible synthase (iNOS) induction substantially suppressed EP-pre-treated BV2 cells reverted Nrf2 knockdown. found EP-induced Nrf2 accumulation nucleus recruits p300, transcriptional co-activator Nrf2 p65, inhibiting p65-p300 interaction. Competition Nrf2 p65 p300 binding confirmed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull assay reporter gene analysis. results demonstrate EP induced nuclear translocation Nrf2 binds along p300 hampers iNOS expression via depleting p300 p65. novel anti-inflammatory mechanism conveyed EP, enhances protective effect converging anti-inflammatory anti-oxidative effects might applicable various Nrf2-activating agents, phytochemicals.
