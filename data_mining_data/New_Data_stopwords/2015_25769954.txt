 functional levels, besides genes proteins, changes metabolome profiles instructive biological system health disease including malignancy. understood metabolomic alterations association proteomic transcriptomic aberrations fundamental unravel malignant micro-ambient criticality oral cancer exception. Hence deciphering intricate dimensions oral cancer metabolism may contributory integrated appreciation pathogenesis identify critical yet unexplored dimension malignancy high mortality rate. Although several methods exist, NMR provides higher analytical precision identification cancer metabolomic signature. Present study explored abnormal signatures choline metabolism oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) using (1)H (13)C NMR analysis serum. demonstrated down-regulation choline concomitant up-regulation break-down product form trimethylamine N-oxide OSCC compared normal counterpart. Further, significant change lactate profile OSCC possibly indicated well-known Warburg effect prominent phenomenon malignancy. Amongst important metabolites, malonate shown up-regulation d-glucose, saturated fatty acids, acetate threonine show significant change. Analyzing metabolomic findings present study proposed trimethyl amine N-oxide malonate important metabolic signature oral cancer prominent Warburg effect.
