 ATP synthase chromatophores Rhodobacter caspulatus effectively generate transmembrane pH difference coupled hydrolysis ATP. rate hydrolysis rather insensitive depletion ADP assay medium ATP regenerating system (phospho-enol-pyruvate (PEP) pyruvate kinase (PK)). steady state values DeltapH however drastically reduced consequence ADP depletion. clamped concentrations ADP obtained using different PK activities assay medium could calculated apparent Kd approximately 0.5 microM estimated. extent proton uptake also strongly dependent addition phosphate assay medium. Kd effect 70 microM. Analogous experiments performed membrane fragment Escherichia coli. case, however, hydrolysis rate strongly inhibited Pi, added 3 mM. Inhibition Pi nearly completely suppressed following depletion ADP. Kd's ADP Pi micromolar range submillimolar range, respectively, mutually dependent concentration ligand. Contrary hydrolysis, pumping protons rather insensitive changes concentrations two ligands. intermediate concentrations, proton pumping actually stimulated, hydrolysis inhibited. concluded that, two bacterial organisms, ADP phosphate induce functional state ATP synthase competent tightly coupled proton pumping, depletion either one two ligands favors inefficient (slipping) functional state. switch states probably related structural change C-terminal alpha-helical hairpin epsilon-subunit, extended conformation, ATP hydrolysis tightly coupled proton pumping, retracted one, ATP hydrolysis proton pumping loosely coupled.
