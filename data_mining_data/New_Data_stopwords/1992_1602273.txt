 Purine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP, IMP), creatine, phosphocreatine, lactate, pyruvate glycogen measured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) white muscle following exercise exhaustion. Estimates intracellular pH permitted calculation free concentrations nucleotides ([nucleotide]f) required models control energy metabolism. Creatine charge, [PCr]/([PCr]+[Cr]), fell 0.49 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- S.E.M.) 0.08 +/- 0.02 exercise recovered completely first sample (2 h). Although [ATP] declined 24% resting levels recovered slowly, RATP, [ATP]/([ATP]+[ADP]f+[AMP]f), energy charge, EC, ([ATP]+0.5[ADP]f)/([ATP]+[ADP]f+[AMP]f), recovered quickly creatine charge. Changes [IMP] mirrored [ATP], suggesting AMP deaminase responsible maintaining RATP EC. Recovery carbon status much slower recovery energy status. Lactate increased 4 mumol g-1 rest 40 mumol g-1 exhaustion recover 8 h. Glycogen depletion resynthesis followed similar time course. early stages recovery, calculated [ADP]f declined 10-fold relative resting values. resulting high [ATP]/[ADP]f ratios may limit rate white muscle mitochondria produce ATP fuel glycogenesis situ. postulated high [ATP]/[ADP]f ratios required drive pyruvate kinase reverse direction glyconeogenesis recovery.
