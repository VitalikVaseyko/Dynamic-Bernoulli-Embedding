 Aerobic glycolysis dominant metabolic pathway utilized cancer cells, owing ability divert glucose metabolites ATP production towards synthesis cellular building blocks (nucleotides, amino acids, lipids) meet demands proliferation. M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) catalyzes final also rate-limiting reaction glycolytic pathway. PK family, PKM2 subjected complex regulation oncogenes tumour suppressors, allows fine-tone regulation PKM2 activity. less active form PKM2 drives glucose route aerobic glycolysis, active PKM2 directs glucose towards oxidative metabolism. Additionally, PKM2 possesses protein tyrosine kinase activity plays role modulating gene expression thereby contributing tumorigenesis. discuss current understanding PKM2's regulation many contributions tumorigenesis.
