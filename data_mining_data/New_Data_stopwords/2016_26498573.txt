 Aggressive behavior diffuse infiltrative growth main features Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), together high degree resistance recurrence. Evidence indicate GBM-derived stem cells (GSCs), endowed unlimited proliferative potential, play critical role tumor development maintenance. Among many signaling pathways involved maintaining GSC stemness, tumorigenic potential, anti-apoptotic properties, PDK1/Akt pathway challenging target develop new potential agents able affect GBM resistance chemotherapy. effort find new PDK1/Akt inhibitors, rationally designed synthesized small family 2-oxindole derivatives. Among them, compound 3 inhibited PDK1 kinase downstream effectors CHK1, GS3Kalpha GS3Kbeta, contribute GCS survival. Compound 3 appeared good tool studying role PDK1/Akt pathway GCS self-renewal tumorigenicity, might represent starting point development potent focused multi-target therapies GBM.
