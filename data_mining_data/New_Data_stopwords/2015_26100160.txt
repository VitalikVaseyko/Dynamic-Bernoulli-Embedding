 assess whether serum lactate potential biomarker non-glial cell brain tumors. Rapidly growing tumor cells typically glycolytic rates 200 times higher normal tissues origin produce lactate even presence oxygen. phenomenon called Warburg effect. recently showed serum lactate levels used potential non-invasive biomarker glial cell brain tumors, correlates tumor grade extent malignancy. present study, found patients metastatic brain tumors significantly higher baseline serum lactate levels compared patients meningioma pituitary tumors. statistically significant association metastatic brain tumors elevated serum lactate. demonstrate lactate used non-invasive biomarker determine malignancy brain tumors. analyses larger populations needed establish value serum lactate determining response therapy early recurrence.
