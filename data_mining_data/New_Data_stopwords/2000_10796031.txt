 describe isolation characterization pyruvate kinase thermophilic eubacterium Bacillus acidocaldarius. protein appears tetramer composed four 55-kDa subunits. intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence protein quenched approximately 20% upon binding sodium, occurs dissociation constant near 15 mM. Importantly, intrinsic fluorescence pyruvate kinase appear affected potassium, magnesium, calcium concentrations found whole blood. appears pyruvate kinase provide basis selective protein sensor sodium minimal interference cations.
