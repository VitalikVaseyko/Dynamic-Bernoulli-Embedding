 BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle fibers malignant hyperthermia (MH)-susceptible humans swine markedly sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR1) agonists normal individuals. Reproducible shifts dose-response skeletal muscle caffeine halothane basis current vitro diagnostic caffeine-halothane contracture test. attempt develop less invasive MH diagnostic test, authors determined effects RyR1 agonists (caffeine, 4-chloro-m-cresol [4CmC], halothane) adductor muscle respect lactate-pyruvate (L/P) system percutaneously dialyzed using microdialysis technique homozygous MH-susceptible compared normal swine. METHODS: Animals anesthetized (ketamine-propofol) artificially ventilated. Sets six CMA/20 microdialysis catheters implanted; catheter perfused different RyR1 agonist concentrations. 30-min equilibration implantation, one catheters perfused (2 microl/min) vehicle (0.9% saline lipid emulsion), five perfused caffeine (1-64 mM), 4CmC (0.1-8 mM), halothane (prepared lipid emulsion; 10-500 mM). Outflow dialysate fractions collected 10-min intervals L/P parameters measured enzymatically. RESULTS: MH-susceptible group RyR1 agonists increase dialysate L/P dose-dependent manner. dose-effect relations prominent 4CmC. halothane lipid emulsion, data scatter high compared caffeine group especially 4CmC group. signs global muscle rigidity, systemic hypermetabolism, clinical MH episode microdialysis RyR1 perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: authors data demonstrate vivo muscle microdialysis porcine L/P system reveals distinct differences MH-susceptible MH-normal muscle, especially response highly specific RyR1 agonists 4CmC. microdialysis L/P technique seems MH diagnostic potential clinical setting.
