 Hypothalamic effects gluconeogenesis glycosis rat liver studied byelectrical stimulations ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (LH) without disturbing animal's behavior. Stimulation VMH caused increase activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key gluconeogenic enzyme, marked suppression pyruvate kinase (PK), key glycolytic enzyme, liver. Stimulationof LH, hand, resulted decrease PEPCK activity alterPK activity. maximal responses enzymes hypothalamic stimulations obtained intermittent stimulations 4 h. Differential estimations thetwo isozymes liver PK (types L M) made using antibody typeM PK. level type enzyme altered significantly stimulation either VMH LH. content type L enzyme greatly decreased stimulation VMH affected stimulation LH. reciprical influences VMH LH hepatic carbohydrate metabolism relation neural-hormonal responses discussed.
