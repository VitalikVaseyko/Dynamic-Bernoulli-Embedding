 Mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) integrates multiple extracellular intracellular signals regulate cell growth survival. Hyperactivation mTOR observed various cancers. Regulation mTOR activity thus importance physiological processes tumor development. Here, present pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) novel regulator mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 activity augmented PDK4 overexpression reduced PDK4 suppression various cell lines. Furthermore, PDK4 bound cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) prevented degradation. enhanced CREB consequently transactivated expression Ras homolog enriched brain (RHEB), direct key activator mTORC1, independent AMP-activated protein kinase tuberous sclerosis complex protein 2. PDK4 potentiated mTORC1 effectors hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha pyruvate kinase isozymes M2 promoted aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Knockdown PDK4 suppressed tumor development cancer cells activated mTORC1. abundance PDK4 dictated responsiveness cells mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Combinatory suppression mTOR PDK4 exerted synergistic inhibition cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, PDK4 promotes tumorigenesis activation CREB-RHEB-mTORC1 signaling cascade.
