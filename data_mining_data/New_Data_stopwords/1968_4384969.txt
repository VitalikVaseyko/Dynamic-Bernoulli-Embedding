 Cell-free extracts Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis P. pestis catalyzed rapid reversible exchange electrons pyridine nucleotides. Although extent exchange approximated promoted soluble nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) transhydrogenase Pseudomonas fluorescens, reaction pasteurellae associated particulate fraction influenced adenosine-2'-monophosphate. ability P. pseudotuberculosis utilize system maintenance large pool nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate could correlated significant participation Entner-Doudoroff path catabolic use hexose-monophosphate path metabolism glucose. judged distribution radioactivity metabolic pyruvate, glucose gluconate fermented via Embden-Meyerhof Entner-Doudoroff paths, respectively. exception hexosediphosphatase, enzymes three paths detected, although little gluconokinase phosphogluconate dehydrase present unless organisms cultivated gluconate. significance findings discussed respect regulation carbohydrate metabolism pasteurellae, related enteric bacteria, P. fluorescens.
