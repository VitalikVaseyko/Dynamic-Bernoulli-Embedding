 Tumor cells display different bioenergetic profiles compared normal cells. present work showed metabolic reprogramming means inhibitors histone deacetylase (HDACis), sodium butyrate trichostatin breast cancer cells representing different stages aggressiveness metabolic profile. testing effect NaB TSA viability cells, shown non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells less affected increasing doses drugs tumorigenic, hormone dependent, tightly cohesive MCF-7, T-47D highly metastatic triple-negative MDA-MB 231 cells. T-47D cells sensitive treatment both, NaB TSA. Experiments measuring anchorage- independent growth tumor cells showed MCF-7, T-47D, MDA-MB-231 cells equally sensitive treatment NaB. NaB induced attenuation glycolysis, reflected decrease lactate release MCF-7 T47D lines. Pyruvate kinase activity significantly enhanced NaB MDA-MB-231 cells only. contrast, inhibitor enhanced lactate dehydrogenase activity specifically T-47 cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity shown differentially modulated NaB cell lines investigated: enzyme inhibited MCF-7 cells, whereas T-47D MDA-MB-231 cells, G6PDH activated. NaB TSA able significantly increase oxygen consumption MDA-MB-231 T-47D cells. Collectively results show epigenetic changes associated acetylation proteins general affect energy metabolism cancer cell lines mitochondria may occupy central role metastasis.
