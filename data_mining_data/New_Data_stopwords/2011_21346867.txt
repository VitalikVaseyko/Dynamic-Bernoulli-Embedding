 Dichloroacetate (DCA) synthetic compound promotes activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) inhibiting repressor protein called pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK). activation PDH leads reduction ambient cellular lactate concentrations vitro vivo contributes therapeutic use DCA treatment systemic lactic acidosis humans. therapeutic potential DCA explored disorders accompanied elevations lactate concentration hypoxic cancer cells. Yet conflicting evidence regarding mutagenic potential major setback clinical trials. Hence, docking descriptor analysis halogen substituted DCA analogues performed find drug candidate less toxicity better binding affinity DCA. Docking analysis carried using human PDHK isozyme 2, physiological receptor DCA. Bromo(iodo)acetate Diiodoacetate found plausible analogues DCA study.
