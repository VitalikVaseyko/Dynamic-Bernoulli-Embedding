 Bioprocesses conducted conditions restricted O(2) supply increasingly exploited synthesis reduced biochemicals using different biocatalysts. model facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli elaborate sensing signal transduction mechanisms redox control response availability O(2) electron acceptors. ArcBA two-component system consists ArcB, membrane-associated sensor kinase, ArcA, cognate response regulator. tripartite hybrid kinase ArcB possesses transmembrane, PAS, primary transmitter (H1), receiver (D1), phosphotransfer (H2) domain. Metabolic fluxes compared anoxic conditions wild-type E. coli strain, DeltaarcB derivative, two partial arcB deletion mutants ArcB lacked either H1 domain PAS-H1-D1 domains. analyses revealed elimination different segments ArcB determines distinctive distribution d-glucose catabolic fluxes, different observed DeltaarcB background. Metabolite profiles, enzyme activity levels, gene expression patterns also investigated strains. Relevant alterations observed P-enol-pyruvate/pyruvate acetyl coenzyme metabolic nodes, formation reduced fermentation metabolites, succinate, d-lactate, ethanol, favored mutant strains different extents compared wild-type strain. phenotypic traits associated altered levels enzymatic activities operating nodes, well elevated NADH/NAD(+) ratios. Thus, targeted modification global regulators obtain different metabolic flux distributions anoxic conditions emerging attractive tool metabolic engineering purposes.
