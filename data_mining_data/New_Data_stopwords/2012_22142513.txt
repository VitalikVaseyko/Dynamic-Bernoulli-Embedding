 expression programmed cell death 6 (PDCD6) known down-regulated cancer cell lines ovarian cancer tissues compared normal cells tissues. current study, characterized specific function PDCD6 novel pro-apoptotic protein. define roles PDCD6 cisplatin tumorigenesis, either over-expressed PDCD6 treated cisplatin SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. PDCD6 cisplatin respectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation dose-dependent manner. combined treatment PDCD6 cisplatin effective suppressing cell growth either drug treatment alone, effect treatment caspase-3 caspase-9 inhibitors. Cleavages caspase-3, -8, -9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) PDCD6-overexpressing cells significantly increased cisplatin treatment. Cell cycle analysis highly correlated down-regulation cyclin D1 CDK4, induction p16 p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Additionally, PDCD6 also suppressed phosphorylation signaling regulators downstream PI3K, including PDK1 Akt. PDCD6 promotes TNFalpha-dependent apoptosis activation NF-kappaB signaling pathways, increasing Bax, p53, p21 expression, also down-regulating Bcl-2 Bcl-xL expression. p21 p53 promoter luciferase activities enhanced PDCD6, affect p53(-/-) p21(-/-). time, p53 activity confirmed UV irradiation siPDCD6. Taken together, results provide evidence PDCD6 mediate pro-apoptotic activity cisplatin TNFalpha down-regulation NF-kappaB expression.
