 Epigenetic regulation histone methyltransferase G9a known control autophagic responses. link autophagy metabolic homeostasis widely accepted, investigated whether G9a affects metabolic circuitries affect autophagic response glioma cells. pharmacological inhibition siRNA mediated knockdown G9a increased autophagy marker LC3B glioma cells. G9a inhibitor BIX-01294 (BIX) induced Akt-dependent increase HIF-1alpha expression activity. Inhibition Akt-HIF-1alpha axis reversed BIX-mediated (i) increase LC3B expression (ii) decrease Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) phosphorylation. YAP1 over-expression abrogated BIX induced increase LC3B expression. Interestingly, BIX induced increase metabolic modelers TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis apoptosis regulator) PKM2 (Pyruvate kinase M2) crucial BIX-mediated changes, transfection TIGAR mutant PKM2 siRNA reversed BIX-mediated alterations pYAP1 LC3B expression. Coherent vitro observation, BIX significant effect tumor burden heterotypic xenograft glioma mouse model. Elevated LC3B PKM2 BIX-treated xenograft tissue accompanied decreased YAP1 levels. Taken together, findings suggest Akt-HIF-1alpha axis driven PKM2-YAP1 cross talk activates autophagic responses glioma cells upon G9a inhibition.
