 BACKGROUND: E. coli robust host various genetic manipulations used commonly bioconversion hexose pentose sugars valuable products. One products E. coli make fermentative condition ethanol. However, availability limited reducing equivalence generation competing co-products undermine ethanol yield productivity. Here, constructed E. coli strain produce high yield ethanol hexose pentose sugars modulating expression pyruvate dehydrogenase acetate kinase deleting pathways competing co-products. RESULTS: availability reducing equivalence E. coli increased inducing expression pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) operon anaerobic condition replacement promoter promoters ldhA, frdA, pflB, adhE gapA. SSY05 strain, PDH operon expressed gapA promoter, demonstrated highest PDH activity maximum improvement ethanol yield. Deletion genes responsible competing products, lactate (ldhA), succinate (frdA), acetate (ack) formate (pflB), led significant reduction growth rate anaerobic condition. Modulation acetate kinase expression SSY09 strain regained cell growth rate ethanol produced maximum rate 12 mmol/l/h glucose. resultant SSY09(pZSack) strain efficiently fermented xylose microaerobic condition produced 25 g/l ethanol maximum rate 6.84 mmol/l/h 97% theoretical yield. importantly, fermentation mixture glucose xylose achieved SSY09(pZSack) strain microaerobic condition ethanol produced maximum rate 0.7 g/l/h (15 mmol/l/h), respectively, greater 85% theoretical yield. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli strain SSY09(pZSack) constructed via endogenous pathway engineering fermented glucose xylose ethanol high yield productivity. strain lacking foreign gene ethanol fermentation likely genetically stable therefore tested fermentation lignocellulosic hydrolysate higher scale.
