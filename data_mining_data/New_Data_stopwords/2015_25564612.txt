 Porphyromonas gingivalis major pathogen periodontal diseases, including periodontitis. investigated effect P. gingivalis infection PI3K/Akt (protein kinase B) signaling pathway gingival epithelial cells. Here, found live P. gingivalis, heat-killed P. gingivalis, reduced Akt phosphorylation Thr-308 Ser-473, implies decrease Akt activity. Actually, PI3K, upstream Akt, also inactivated P. gingivalis. Furthermore, glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta, mammalian target rapamycin, Bad, downstream proteins PI3K/Akt cascade, also dephosphorylated, phenomenon consistent Akt inactivation P. gingivalis. However, events require direct interaction bacteria host cells independent P. gingivalis invasion cells. use gingipain-specific inhibitors gingipain-deficient P. gingivalis mutant KDP136 revealed gingipains protease activities essential inactivation PI3K Akt. associations PI3K regulatory subunit p85alpha membrane proteins disrupted wild-type P. gingivalis. Moreover, PDK1 translocation plasma membrane reduced wild-type P. gingivalis, KDP136, indicating little production phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate PI3K. Therefore, likely PI3K failed transmit homeostatic extracellular stimuli intracellular signaling pathways gingipains. Taken together, findings indicate P. gingivalis attenuates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via proteolytic effects gingipains, resulting dysregulation PI3K/Akt-dependent cellular functions destruction epithelial barriers.
