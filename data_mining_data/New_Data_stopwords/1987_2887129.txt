 rapid enzymatic assay method ammonia developed using glutamine synthetase glutamate-producing bacteria together pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, NADH. time required determination 25 nmol ammonia 5 min 1 unit glutamine synthetase, opposed 14-30 min 1 unit glutamate dehydrogenases various sources. present method used determine ammonia serum, microbiol-culture broth, waste water. method modified spectrophotometry visible region substituting pyruvate oxidase, peroxidase, appropriate chromogens lactate dehydrogenase NADH. 4-aminoantipyrine (4AA) phenol, 4AA N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethyl-m-toluidine chromogens, sensitivity ammonia determination 0.65 1.7 times glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively. present method also applicable continuous detection activity ammonia-forming enzymes guanase, adenosine deaminase, urease determination 0.5-30 microM ATP-ADP modification mixture.
