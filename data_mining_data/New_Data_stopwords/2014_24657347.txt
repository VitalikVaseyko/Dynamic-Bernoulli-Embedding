 Optimization bioprocesses mammalian cells mainly concentrates cell engineering, cell screening medium optimization achieve enhanced cell growth productivity. improving cell lines cell engineering techniques, in-depth understandings regulation metabolism product formation well resulting demand different medium components needed. work, relationship cell specific growth uptake rates changes maximum vitro enzyme activities intracellular metabolite pools glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, citric acid cycle energy metabolism determined batch cultivations AGE1.HN.AAT cells. Results obtained modeling cell growth consumption main substrates showed dynamics intracellular metabolite pools primarily linked dynamics specific glucose glutamine uptake rates. analyzing maximum vitro enzyme activities found low activities pyruvate dehydrogenase pyruvate carboxylase suggest reduced metabolite transfer citric acid cycle resulting lactate release (Warburg effect). Moreover, increase volumetric lactate production rate transition exponential stationary growth together transient accumulation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose 1-phosphate ribose 5-phosphate point toward upregulation PK via FBP. Glutaminase activity 44-fold lower activity glutamine synthetase. seemed sufficient supply intermediates biosynthesis might lead unnecessary dissipation ATP. Taken together, results elucidate regulation metabolic networks immortalized mammalian cells changes metabolite pools time course batch cultivations. Eventually, enables use cell engineering strategies improve availability building blocks biomass synthesis increasing glucose well glutamine fluxes. additional knockdown glutamine synthetase might help prevent unnecessary dissipation ATP, yield cell line optimized growth characteristics increased overall productivity.
