 Pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme mutants amino acid substitutions subunit interface prepared characterized. substitutions made allosteric M2 isozyme corresponding residues nonallosteric M1 isozyme identify residue involved allosteric effects. replacement Cys-423 Leu led substantial loss homotropic heterotropic allosteric effects substitutions Phe-389, Arg-398, Ala-401, Pro-402, Thr-408, Ile-427 not. altered kinetic properties Cys-423-substituted mutant resulted shift allosteric transition toward active R-state since mutant exhibits allosteric properties presence allosteric inhibitor, L-phenylalanine. inverse correlation hydrophobicity residue 423 extent stabilization R-state found analysis mutants un-ionizable amino acids position 423. Furthermore, modification Cys-423 methyl methanethiosulfonate led shift allosteric transition toward R-state, probably result increased hydrophobicity residue. results suggest Cys-423 involved allosteric regulation enzyme hydrophobic interactions.
