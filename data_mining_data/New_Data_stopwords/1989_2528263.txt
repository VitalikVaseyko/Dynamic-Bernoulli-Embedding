 activities key glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) hexokinase addition adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measured lymphocytes 39 cases B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). According percentage circulating large non-granular atypical lymphocytes (AL) B-CLL cases classified as: typical (less 10% AL; 28 cases) atypical (10-25% AL; 11 cases). groups median lymphocyte volume (MLV) assessed correlated correspondent enzyme activities. MLV B-CLL lymphocytes significantly (p less 0.001) decreased (149.9 +/- 19.4 fl) compared normal B lymphocytes (175.1 +/- 14.5 fl) significantly (p less 0.001) lower typical B-CLL (141.8 +/- 12.2 fl) atypical B-CLL (172.0 +/- 17.2 fl). Furthermore, patients typical B-CLL, enzyme activities expressed U/10(9) cells were, exception PFK, significantly decreased compared normal B lymphocytes. However, results expressed U/ml cells, PK, PNP LDH remained significantly low. findings demonstrate determination MLV addition morphology may useful tool distinguish two previously described morphological B-CLL variants (typical atypical) two different B-CLL groups also distinguishable basis three enzyme activities, PK, PNP LDH shown less dependent cell size enzymes, also studied here.
