 Glucose exerts powerful effects hepatocyte gene transcription mechanisms incompletely understood. c-Myc regulates hepatic glucose metabolism increasing glycolytic enzyme gene transcription concomitantly decreasing gluconeogenic ketogenic enzyme gene expression. However, molecular mechanisms c-Myc exerts effects known. study, glucose-mediated induction L-type pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA levels diminished maneuvers involving recombinant adenoviral vectors interfere (i) c-Myc protein levels antisense expression (ii) c-Myc function dominant-negative Max protein. results obtained using HL1C rat hepatoma cells primary rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, decrease c-Myc abundance reduced glucose production HL1C cells, presumably decreasing glucose-6-phosphatase activity. repression hormone-activated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription glucose affected reduction c-Myc levels. basal mRNA levels L-pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphatase altered significant degree adenoviral treatment. Furthermore, adenoviral overexpression c-Myc protein induced glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA absence glucose stimulation. conclude multiple mechanisms exist communicate glucose-derived signal c-Myc key role hepatic glucose signaling pathway.
