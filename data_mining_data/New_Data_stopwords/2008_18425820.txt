 Tumor cells express glycolytic regulator pyruvate kinase subtype M2 (M2-PK), occur tetrameric form high affinity substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) dimeric form low PEP affinity. transition conformations contributes control glycolysis important tumor cell proliferation survival. targeted M2-PK synthetic peptide aptamers, specifically bind M2-PK shift isoenzyme low affinity dimeric conformation. aptamer-induced dimerization inactivation M2-PK led significant decrease PK mass-action ratio well ATP:ADP ratio target cells. Furthermore, expression M2-PK-binding peptide aptamers moderately reduced growth immortalized NIH3T3 cell populations decelerating cell proliferation, without affecting apoptotic cell death. Moreover, M2-PK-binding peptide aptamers also reduced proliferation rate human U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells. present study, developed first specific inhibitors pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 present evidence inhibitors moderately decelerate tumor cell proliferation.
