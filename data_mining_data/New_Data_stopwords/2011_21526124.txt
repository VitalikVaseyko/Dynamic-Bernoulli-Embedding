 Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) complex three-dimensional deformity spine. cause pathogenesis scoliosis accompanying generalized osteopenia remain unclear despite decades extensive research. study, utilized two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled mass spectrometry (MS) analyze differential proteome bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) AIS patients. total, 41 significantly altered protein spots detected, 34 spots identified MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis found represent 25 distinct gene products. Among proteins, five related bone growth development, including pyruvate kinase M2, annexin A2, heat shock 27 kDa protein, gamma-actin, beta-actin, found dysregulated therefore selected validation Western blot analysis. protein level, results supported previous hypothesis decreased osteogenic differentiation ability MSCs one mechanisms leading osteopenia AIS. summary, analyzed differential BM-MSCs proteome AIS patients first time, may help elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms bone loss AIS also increase understanding etiology pathogenesis AIS.
