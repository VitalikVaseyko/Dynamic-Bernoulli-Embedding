 Transformation latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle fast-twitch, fatigue-prone fatigue-resistant ("heart-like") muscle, necessary allow application cardiac assist devices, induced chronic electrical stimulation. adult dogs studied nature time course myofibrillar metabolic adaptations LD muscle exposed situ 24 weeks continuous electrical stimulation. addition, metabolic properties stimulated muscle compared canine cardiac muscle. proportion immunohistochemically identified type fibres increased stimulation 28% 80%, type II fibres decreased 69% 16%. Fibres intermediate type (IIC IC) appeared transiently; highest levels found 4 8 weeks stimulation. activities fructose-6-phosphate kinase lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), stimulation similar heart, decreased 18% 34% initial values respectively. However, LDH isozyme pattern changed towards typical cardiac muscle. changes indicate markedly decreased flux capacity glycolytic pathway which, however, directed towards oxidative conversion substrates. mitochondrial capacity (maximal palmitate oxidation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activities) muscle change remained level less half cardiac ventricular muscle. Contents adenine nucleotides endogenous substrates maintained stimulation. changes observed adaptations occurred week 12 stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
