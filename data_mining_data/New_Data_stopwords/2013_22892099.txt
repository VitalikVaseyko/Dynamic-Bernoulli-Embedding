 estuarine crab Neohelice granulata exposed (96 h) sublethal copper concentration two different physiological conditions (hyperosmoregulating crabs: 2 ppt salinity, 1 mg Cu/L; isosmotic crabs: 30 ppt salinity, 5 mg Cu/L). exposure, gills (anterior posterior) dissected activities enzymes involved glycolysis (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), Krebs cycle (citrate synthase), mitochondrial electron transport chain (cytochrome c oxidase) analyzed. Membrane potential mitochondria isolated anterior posterior gill cells also evaluated. anterior gills crabs acclimated 2 ppt salinity, copper exposure inhibited hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase activity, increased lactate dehydrogenase activity, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. posterior gills, copper inhibited hexokinase pyruvate kinase activity, increased citrate synthase activity. anterior gills crabs acclimated 30 ppt salinity, copper exposure inhibited phosphofructokinase citrate synthase activity, increased hexokinase activity. posterior gills, copper inhibited phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activity, increased hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase activity. Copper affect cytochrome c oxidase activity either anterior posterior gills crabs acclimated 2 30 ppt salinity. findings indicate exposure sublethal copper concentration affects activity enzymes involved glycolysis Krebs cycle, especially anterior (respiratory) gills hyperosmoregulating crabs. Changes observed indicate switch aerobic anaerobic metabolism, characterizing situation functional hypoxia. case, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential would suggest decrease ATP production. Although gills isosmotic crabs also affected copper exposure, changes observed suggest impact overall tissue ATP production. Also, findings suggest copper exposure would stimulate pentose phosphate pathway support antioxidant system requirements. Although N. granulata tolerant copper, acute exposure metal disrupt energy balance affecting biochemical systems involved carbohydrate metabolism.
