 Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) isolated purified chicken turkey breast muscle purification procedure similar used bovine skeletal muscle isozyme (Cardenas, J., Dyson, R., strandholm, J. (1973), J. Biol. Chem. 248,6931). study chemical physical properties chicken enzyme revealed tetramer four apparently identical subunits, closely resembling respects mamalian type 7 isozyme. properties two enzymes similar enough permit subunits chicken type pyruvate kinase combine subunits mammalian type L (one three mammalian isozymes) form interspecies tetrameric hybrid isozymes relative quantities differ makedly formed L isozymes mammalian origin. similarity mammalian avian type pyruvates kinases suggests close evolutionary relationship. comparisons among three mammalian two avian isozymes pyruvate kinase consistent common evolutionary origin, perhaps ancestral form type K isozyme, pyruvate kinase identified mammalian avian embryos.
