 specific activities changes four placental enzymes: pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconic-dehydrogenase (6PGD), NADP malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MD) occurring course gestation maternal restricted food intake, studied rats. Enzymes activities expressed relation DNA. progress pregnancy, significant increase activity enzymes, except NADP-MD, observed groups. 50% food restriction pregnancy markedly decreased cell placental enzymes different stages development. PK lower early late pregnancy, NADP-MD reduced early developmental stage. activities G6PD 6PGD significantly lower near-term stage malnourished group comparison control group. findings suggest kind nutritional insult markedly reduces glycolytic capacity NADPH2 generation enzymes, key factor placental steroids metabolism.
