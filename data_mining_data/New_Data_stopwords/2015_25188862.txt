 Plumbagin nutraceutical potent anti-cancer activity. However, therapeutic efficacy plumbagin overshadowed lack sensitivity selectivity towards cancer cells. present study evaluated use nano-biotechnological intervention cage plumbagin silver nanoparticles selective targeting biological effects towards cancerous cells. Caging plumbagin silver nanoparticles imparted selectivity sensitivity plumbagin selective killing cancer cells altering redox signalling events cancer cells. selectivity sensitivity plumbagin towards cancer cells due cumulative expression properties plumbagin nanoparticles specifically affected differential cancer cell microenvironment altering pyruvate kinase activity regulates ROS challenge cancerous cells. positive surface charge plumbagin caged silver nanoparticles (PCSN) aids getting targeted towards anionic cancerous cells due exposed terminal carboxyl group sialic acid residues. Furthermore, observed effective concentration drug required induce apoptosis brought 50% upon caging plumbagin silver nanoparticles. observed effect individual compound alone. results indicated physico-chemical biochemical properties plumbagin significantly changed conjugation nanomaterials facilitated "adding-in" therapeutical values plumbagin would otherwise overshadowed lack sensitivity selectivity towards cancer cells.
