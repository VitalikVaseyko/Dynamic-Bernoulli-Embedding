 Cancer cells undergo increased steady-state ROS condition compared normal cells. Among major metabolic differences cancer cells normal cells dependence cancer cells glycolysis major source energy even presence oxygen (Warburg effect). Warburg effect, glucose catabolized lactate extruded monocarboxylate transporters microenvironment cancer cells, normal cells, glucose metabolized pyruvate extruded. Pyruvate potent antioxidant, lactate antioxidant effect. Pyruvate normal cells may metabolized acetyl CoA Krebs cycle production antioxidant intermediates e.g. citrate, malate oxaloacetate together reducing equivalents (NADH.H+). activity mitochondrial transhydrogenase, NADH.H+ replenishes NADPH.H+, coenzyme glutathione reductase replenishes reduced form glutathione (potent antioxidant). enhances antioxidant capacities normal cells, cancer cells exhibiting Warburg effect may deprived antioxidant capabilities due loss extruded lactate (substrate Krebs cycle). Although intrinsic oxidative stress cancer cells high, may prevented reaching progressively increasing levels cytotoxic cancer cells. may due antioxidant effects exerted hexokinase II (HK II) NADPH.H+ produced HMP shunt. Glycolytic phenotype cancer cells maintains high non-toxic oxidative stress cancer cells may responsible malignant behavior. HK II, glycolysis fuels energetic arm malignancy, mitotic arm malignancy (DNA synthesis HMP shunt pathway) metastatic arm malignancy (hyaluronan synthesis uronic acid pathway) addition role phosphohexose isomerase (autocrine motility factor). critical three arms start substrate G6P direct product HK II. 3-bromopyruvate (3BP, inhibitor HK II) may prove promising anticancer antimetastatic agent based antagonizing Warburg effect disturbing malignant behavior cancer cells.
