 tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) small macropodid marsupial major part weaning occupies period 28 36 weeks pouch life. weaning diet tammar high carbohydrate low lipid/volatile fatty acid whereas reverse applies weaning. adult tammar forestomach fermenter. aim study elucidate physiological metabolic changes associated major change diet. Hepatic glycogen content increased gradually early development maximum 7% liver weight 28-30 weeks pouch life. fell precipitously less 1% liver weight 36 weeks recovering adult level 3% liver weight. Plasma glucose levels maintained 10 mM 36 weeks, fell gradually adult values 4 mM. Hepatic hexokinase activity increased several-fold 18 30 weeks pouch life, remained high 42 weeks, fell adult level. hepatic activities fructose-bisphosphatase particulate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) unchanged development soluble hepatic PEPCK activity, low 28 weeks pouch life, increased 3-4 fold 30 36 weeks fell slightly adult level. Hepatic pyruvate kinase increased activity 28 weeks fell half peak values 36 weeks 20% peak activity adult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
