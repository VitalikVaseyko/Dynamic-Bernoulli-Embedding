 Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis, marked increased metabolism glucose lactate presence oxygen. Despite widespread prevalence physiology cancer biology, causes consequences remain incompletely understood. Here, show simple balance interacting fluxes glycolysis creates constraints impose necessary conditions glycolytic flux generate lactate opposed entering mitochondria. conditions determined cellular redox energy demands. analyzing constraints sampling feasible region model, study cell proliferation rate mitochondria-associated NADH oxidizing ATP producing fluxes interlinked. Together analysis illustrates simplicity origins Warburg effect identifying flux distributions necessary instantiation.
