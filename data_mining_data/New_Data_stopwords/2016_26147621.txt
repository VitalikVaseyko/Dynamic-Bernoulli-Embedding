 INTRODUCTION: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex localized mitochondrial matrix catalyzing irreversible decarboxylation pyruvate acetyl-CoA NADH. proper complex regulation E1-alpha subunit functions on/off switch regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. different cell types one four-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms (PDHK1-4) phosphorylate subunit leading PDH inactivation. previous results human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC), suggested PDHK could key regulator metabolic profile pluripotent cells, upregulated pluripotent stem cells. Therefore, wondered metabolic modulation, via inexpensive pharmacological inhibition PDHK, could impact metabolism pluripotency. METHODS/RESULTS: order assess importance PDH cycle mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESC), incubated cells PDHK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) observed presence ESC started differentiate. Changes mitochondrial function proliferation potential also found protein levels PDH (both phosphorylated non-phosphorylated) PDHK1 monitored. Interestingly, also able describe possible pathway involves Hif-1alpha p53 DCA-induced loss pluripotency. Results ESCs treated DCA comparable obtained cells grown without Leukemia Inhibitor Factor (LIF), used case positive control differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: DCA negatively affects ESC pluripotency changing cell metabolism elements related PDH cycle, suggesting PDHK could function possible metabolic gatekeeper ESC, may good target modulate metabolism differentiation. Although molecular biology-based experiments required, data suggests inactive PDH favors pluripotency ESC similar strategies cancer cells maintain glycolytic profile, using signaling pathways found latter cells.
