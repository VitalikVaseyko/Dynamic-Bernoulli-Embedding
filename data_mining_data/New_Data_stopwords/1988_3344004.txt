 pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) Leishmania major promastigotes multimer 59 kDa subunits Mr 181000. activated substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) positively cooperative manner, heterotropically fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Kinetics regard phosphate acceptor adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), MgCl2, KCl hyperbolic unaffected FBP. enzyme strongly inhibited reaction product ATP, well GTP ITP, lesser degree citrate. seven amino acids reported inhibit pyruvate kinases organisms, none effect L. major pyruvate kinase vitro. enzyme shows maximum activity pH 7.0 absence FBP, pH 7.6 presence. Contrary previous suggestions, enzyme appears well-suited regulatory role metabolism aerobic organism capable net glucose synthesis.
