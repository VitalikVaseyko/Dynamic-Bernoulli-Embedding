 novel two-component system, CbrA-CbrB, discovered Pseudomonas aeruginosa; cbrA cbrB mutants strain PAO found unable use several amino acids (such arginine, histidine proline), polyamines agmatine sole carbon nitrogen sources. mutants also unable use, used poorly, many carbon sources, including mannitol, glucose, pyruvate citrate. 7 kb EcoRI fragment carrying cbrA cbrB genes cloned sequenced. cbrA cbrB genes encode sensor/histidine kinase (Mr 108 379, 983 residues) cognate response regulator (Mr 52 254, 478 residues) respectively. amino-terminal half (490 residues) CbrA appears sensor membrane domain, predicted 12 possible transmembrane helices, whereas carboxy-terminal part shares homology histidine kinases NtrB family. CbrB response regulator shows similarity NtrC family members. Complementation primer extension experiments indicated cbrA cbrB transcribed separate promoters. cbrA cbrB mutants, well allelic argR9901 argR9902 mutants, aot-argR operon induced arginine, indicating essential role two-component system expression ArgR-dependent catabolic pathways, including aruCFGDB operon specifying major aerobic arginine catabolic pathway. histidine catabolic enzyme histidase expressed cbrAB mutants, even presence histidine. contrast, proline dehydrogenase, responsible proline utilization (Pru), expressed cbrB mutant level comparable wild-type strain. succinate C4-dicarboxylates added proline medium 1 mM, cbrB mutant restored Pru+ phenotype. succinate-dependent Pru+ property almost abolished 20 mM ammonia. conclusion, CbrA-CbrB system controls expression several catabolic pathways and, perhaps together NtrB-NtrC system, appears ensure intracellular carbon: nitrogen balance P. aeruginosa.
