 Many biologically active bacterial natural products contain highly modified deoxysugar residues often critical activity parent compounds. deoxysugars secondary metabolites biosynthesized form nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) sugars prior transfer natural product aglycones glycosyltransferases. past decade, many biosynthetic pathways lead formation unusual sugars unraveled, mechanisms many key enzymatic transformations involved pathways elucidated. However, obtaining workable quantities NDP-deoxysugars vitro studies often difficult task. limitation hindered in-depth investigation substrate specificity deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes, many promiscuous respect NDP-sugar substrates are, thus, potentially useful catalysts natural product glycoengineering. Presented review procedures enzymatic synthesis purification variety NDP-deoxysugars, including early intermediates NDP-deoxysugar biosynthetic pathways, highly modified NDP-deoxysugars late intermediates respective biosynthetic pathways. procedures described herein could used general guidelines development specific protocols synthesis NDP-deoxysugars.
