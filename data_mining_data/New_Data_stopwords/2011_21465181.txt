 Activation transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3) frequently observed prostate cancer linked tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis. study, investigated effect ursolic acid (UA) NF-kappaB STAT3 signaling pathways androgen-independent (DU145) androgen-dependent (LNCaP) prostate cancer cell lines also prospectively tested hypothesis NF-kappaB STAT3 inhibition using virtual predictive functional proteomics tumor pathway technology platform. found UA inhibited constitutive TNF-alpha-induced activation NF-kappaB DU145 LNCaP cells dose-dependent manner. suppression mediated inhibition constitutive TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation, phosphorylation IkappaBalpha p65 NF-kappaB-dependent reporter activity. Furthermore, UA suppressed constitutive inducible STAT3 activation prostate cancer cells concomitant suppression activation upstream kinases (Src JAK2) STAT3-dependent reporter gene activity. UA also downregulated expression various NF-kappaB STAT3 regulated gene products involved proliferation, survival, angiogenesis induced apoptosis cells lines evidenced DNA fragmentation annexin V staining. vivo, UA (200 mg/kg b.w.) treated 6 weeks inhibited growth DU145 cells nude mice without significant effect body weight. Overall, results experimental predictive studies suggest UA mediates anti-tumor effects suppression NF-kappaB STAT3 pathways prostate cancer.
