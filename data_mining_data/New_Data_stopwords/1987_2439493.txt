 Allosteric activation pyruvate kinase thermophilic bacterium, Bacillus stearothermophilus, ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) kinetically examined. Two activated forms enzyme could distinguished, depending R5P concentration. One form (Form I) observed 10(-5) R5P. showed slightly negative cooperativity phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). form (Form II) observed 10(-3) R5P showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics PEP. PEP ADP concentrations yield half-maximal velocity essentially identical two forms (about 0.1 0.5 mM, respectively), Form larger Vmax value Form II. absence R5P, enzyme showed homotropic positive cooperativity PEP; concentration required half-maximal velocity 2 mM ADP 1.6 mM. enzyme susceptible protease digestion presence R5P absence it. concentration R5P required enzyme susceptible protease digestion approximately identical required generate Form I. 10(-3) R5P, thermostability enzyme greatly increased. concentration R5P required enzyme thermostable good agreement required generate Form II. results indicate two activated forms distinguished kinetically differ conformations, too. saturating level PEP cause change thermostability susceptibility protease.
