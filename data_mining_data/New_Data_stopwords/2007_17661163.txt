 described Warburg 50 years ago, tumour cells maintain high glycolytic rate even conditions adequate oxygen supply. However, tumours subjected hypoxic conditions due abnormal vasculature supply oxygen nutrients. Thus, glycolysis essential tumour survival spread. key step controlling glycolytic rate conversion fructose-6-P fructose-1,6-P(2) 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1). activity PFK-1 allosterically controlled fructose-2,6-P(2), product enzymatic activity dual kinase/phosphatase family enzymes (PFKFB1-4) increased significant number tumour types. turn, enzymes induced hypoxia activation HIF-1 complex (hypoxia-inducible complex-1), transcriptional activator controls expression hypoxia-regulated genes. HIF-1 complex overexpressed variety tumours expression appears correlate poor prognosis responses chemo radiotherapy. Thus, targeting PFKFB enzymes, either directly inhibition HIF-1, appears promising approach treatment certain tumours.
