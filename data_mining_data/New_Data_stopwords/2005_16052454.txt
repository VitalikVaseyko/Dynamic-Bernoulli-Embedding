 Frog jumping excellent model system examining structural basis interindividual variation burst locomotor performance. possible factors affect jump performance, total body size, hindlimb length, muscle mass, muscle mechanical biochemical properties, analysed interindividual (intraspecies) level tree frog Hyla multilineata. aim study determine physiological anatomical variables vary individuals correlated interindividual variation jump performance. model produced via stepwise linear regression analysis absolute data suggested 62% interindividual variation maximum jump distance could explained combination interindividual variation absolute plantaris muscle mass, total hindlimb muscle mass (excluding plantaris muscle), pyruvate kinase activity. body length effects removed, multiple regression indicated independent variables explained 43% residual interindividual variation jump distance. suggests individuals relatively large jumping muscles high pyruvate kinase activity body size achieved comparatively large maximal jump distances body size.
