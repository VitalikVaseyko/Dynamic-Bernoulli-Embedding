 Freeze inactivation LDH, MDH, ADH, G-6-PDH, PK prevention additives sodium glutamate albumin studied. LDH, MDH, ADH, G-6-PDH, PK, lost activity frozen storage -20 degrees C. speed inactivation differed each. stability enzymes increased increase enzyme concentration. Sodium glutamate albumin prevented freeze inactivation. activity LDH solution frozen without additives almost lost day frozen storage, frozen either glutamate (0.2 M) albumin (0.1%) added decreased less quickly. residual activity 1 day 50% initial prefreeze value former 10% latter, respectively. Combined use glutamate albumin prevented inactivation best maintained initial activity almost completely 6 weeks. enzymes tested lost part activity solutions diluted media. inactivation prevented significant extent addition sodium glutamate and/or albumin diluting media.
