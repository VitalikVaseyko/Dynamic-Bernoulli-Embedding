 four substrate-binding sites porcine liver pyruvate kinase labeled photoaffinity reagent 8-azido-2'-O-dansyl-[alpha-32P]ATP (AD-ATP) different experimental conditions. dark, native pyruvate kinase reversibly competitively inhibited AD-ATP, KI = 2.8 microM KADP = 0.18 mM. UV-irradiation, enzyme covalently labeled presence Mg2+ AD-ATP inactivated irreversibly. Measurement photoinactivation process presence various concentrations ADP gave KI = 4.0 microM KADP = 0.2 mM. linear plot relative specific activity partially photolabeled enzyme gel-filtration vs. number label per pyruvate kinase molecule introduced presence Mg2+ shows covalent label completely inactivates tetrameric pyruvate kinase molecule. strict absence Mg2+, three substrate-binding sites pyruvate kinase molecule labeled AD-ATP without decreasing enzyme activity. Subsequent addition Mg2+ enables AD-ATP label remaining site inactivate enzyme. observations show one catalytic three non-catalytic substrate-binding sites pyruvate kinase molecule. probable structural reason possible functional differentiation intrinsically identical substrate-binding sites tetrameric enzymes suggested.
