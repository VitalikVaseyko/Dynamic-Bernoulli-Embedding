 past decade, research unique ways, cancer cells skew metabolism, renaissance-for repeated time 80 years since discovery inherent preference glycolysis. Importantly, Warburg effect arises primary neoplasms sole prominent metabolic phenomenon. transformed cells shed initial growth begin process metastasis, energy requirements change adapt increased demand adenosine triphosphate, satisfied would lead anoikis. stage, oxidoreductases respiratory chain activated. Furthermore, intrinsic metabolic characteristics tumor cells may influenced extrinsic factors, comprising metabolite secretions stromal cells acidification nutrient deprivation late-stage hypoxic environment. metabolic adjustment cancer cells throughout disease history, phenotypic manifestation changes various times. stage selectivity implications pharmacotherapy ambitions.
