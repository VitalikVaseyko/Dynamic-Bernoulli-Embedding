 objective understand reasons behind persistent postprandial hyperglycemia rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). hypothesized species, high levels dietary protein could increase hepatic production glucose, irrespective dietary carbohydrate supply. fed juvenile rainbow trout four diets containing graded levels protein 14 d. Pair-feeding employed keep lipid carbohydrate intakes constant. Six hours feeding, postulated, activities mRNA levels gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) increased increasing dietary protein (P < 0.05). However, fish low protein intake, strong increase plasma glucose (18 mmol/L) also associated high capacity store excess glucose indicated altered pyruvate kinase activity, glucokinase activity, hepatic glycogen fat concentrations (P < 0.05). conclusion, level carbohydrate intake, low dietary protein intake associated unexplained increase glycemia, probably responsible decrease hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme expression. effect dietary protein low carbohydrate utilization species remains unclear.
