 Previous studies demonstrated anti-tumor alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid complex (alpha-LA-OA) may target glycolysis tumor cells. However, data available regarding effects alpha-LA-OA energy metabolism. study, measured glycolysis mitochondrial functions HeLa cells response alpha-LA-OA using XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). gene expression enzymes involved glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transfer chain, ATP synthesis also evaluated. results show alpha-LA-OA significantly enhanced basal glycolysis glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity ATP production also improved response alpha-LA-OA. enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due increased capacity utilizing fatty acids glutamine substrate. However, gene expressions pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 inhibited, suggesting insufficient ability glycolysis process tricarboxylic acid cycle. increased expression acetyl-coenzyme acyltransferase 2, central enzyme involved beta-oxidation fatty acids, would enhance unbalance due decreased expression electron transfer flavoprotein beta subunit, acts electron acceptor. results indicated alpha-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due conditions ATP production exceeding energy demand. results may help clarify mechanism apoptosis induced reactive oxygen species mitochondrial destruction.
