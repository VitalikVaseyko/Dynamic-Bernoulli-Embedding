 Many tumors undergo dramatic metabolic shift known Warburg effect glucose utilization favored oxidative phosphorylation downregulated, even oxygen availability plentiful. However, mechanistic basis switch remained unclear. Recently several independent groups identified tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), mitochondrial molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) family, key modulator mitochondrial respiration. Although reports agree activity TRAP1 important implications neoplastic progression, data different groups partially overlap, suggesting TRAP1 may complex possibly contextual effects tumorigenesis. review analyze recent findings attempt reconcile observations.
