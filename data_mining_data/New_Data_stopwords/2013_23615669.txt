 Cancer cells activate glycolysis, glutaminolysis beta-oxidation promote biosynthesis. low activity pyruvate kinase, reexpressed embryonic isoform PKM2, generates bottleneck end glycolysis, reorients glucose catabolism towards formation molecules implied numerous synthesis: ribose nucleic acids, glycerol lipid synthesis, etc. However, part glucose transformed pyruvate, also comes aminoacids catabolism. Due inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate preferentially transformed lactate, either presence oxygen (Warburg effect). Lactate dehydrogenase reaction furnishes lactic acid, acidifies tumoral microenvironment, process favors cellular growth regenerates NAD(+), crucial cofactor functioning various metabolic pathways (glycolysis, DNA synthesis repair...). Cancer cells consume lot glutamine, replenish Krebs cycle (coupled ATP production), and/or furnishes aspartate nucleotides synthesis. particular metabolism sustained activation oncogenes (Myc, AKT, etc.) suppressors inactivation (P53, PTEN...). Like parasite, cells draw reserves host supply biosynthesis, secrete waste products (NO, polyamines, ammonia, lactate...) promote cellular growth. "symbiotic" cooperation could established tumor cells themselves, and/or environmental cells, maximize ATP production relation resources oxygen concentration.
