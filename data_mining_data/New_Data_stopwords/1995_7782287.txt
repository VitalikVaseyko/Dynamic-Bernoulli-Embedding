 Mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase (alpha 2 beta 2) (E1) regulated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, catalyzed E1-kinase phospho-E1-phosphatase. Using site-directed mutagenesis three phosphorylation sites (sites 1, 2, 3) E1 alpha, several human E1 mutants made single, double, triple mutations changing Ser Ala. Mutation site 1 sites 2 and/or 3 decreased E1 specific activity also increased Km values thiamin pyrophosphate pyruvate. Sites 1, 2, 3 E1 mutants phosphorylated either individually presence sites dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase-protein X-E1 kinase indicating site-independent mechanism phosphorylation. Phosphorylation site resulted complete inactivation E1. However, rates phosphorylation inactivation site-specific. Sites 1, 2, 3 dephosphorylated either individually presence sites phospho-E1-phosphatase resulting complete reactivation E1. rates dephosphorylation reactivation similar sites 1, 2, 3, indicating random dephosphorylation mechanism.
