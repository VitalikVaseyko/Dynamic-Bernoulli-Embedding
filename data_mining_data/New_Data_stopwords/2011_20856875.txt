 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase (PK), catalyzes final step glycolysis converting phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, central metabolic regulator organisms. Consequently PK represents attractive therapeutic target cancer human pathogens, like Apicomplexans. phylum Aplicomplexa, group exclusively parasitic organisms, includes genera Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium Toxoplasma, etiological agents malaria, cryptosporidiosis toxoplasmosis respectively. Toxoplasma gondii infection causes mild illness common infection affecting nearly one third world's population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: determined crystal structure PK1 enzyme T. gondii, B domain open closed conformations. also characterized enzymatic activity confirmed glucose-6-phosphate allosteric activator. first description PK enzyme closed inactive conformation without bound substrate. Comparison two tetrameric TgPK1 structures indicates reorientation monomers concomitant change buried surface among adjacent monomers. change buried surface associated significant B domain movements one interacting monomers. CONCLUSIONS: hypothesize loop interface B domains plays important role linking position B domain buried surface among monomers two alpha-helices. proposed model links catalytic cycle enzyme domain movements highlights contribution interface adjacent subunits. addition, unusual ordered conformation observed one allosteric binding domains related specific apicomplexan insertion. sequence structural particularity would explain atypical activation mono-phosphorylated sugar. sum peculiarities raises enzyme emerging target drug discovery.
