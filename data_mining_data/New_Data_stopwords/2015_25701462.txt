 ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) responsible conversion cytosolic citrate acetyl-CoA oxaloacetate, first rate-limiting enzyme involved de novo lipogenesis. Recent studies demonstrated inhibition elevated ACLY results growth arrest apoptosis subset cancers; however, expression pattern underlying biological function ACLY pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear. current study, overexpressed ACLY commonly observed PDAC compared normal pancreatic tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high expression level ACLY resulted poor prognosis PDAC patients. Silencing endogenous ACLY expression siRNA PANC-1 cells led reduced cell viability increased cell apoptosis. Furthermore, significant decrease glucose uptake lactate production observed ACLY knocked down, effect blocked 2-deoxy-D-glucose, indicating ACLY functions Warburg effect affect PDAC cell growth. Collectively, study reveals suppression ACLY plays anti-tumor role decreased Warburg effect, ACLY-related inhibitors might potential therapeutic approaches PDAC.
