 Successful vitro maturation (IVM) oocytes obtained medium-sized antral follicles could avoid need superovulation vitro fertilization. wide range doses FSH used IVM prompted us study effect varying concentrations FSH dynamics nutrient uptake production individual maturing mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). COCs isolated antral follicles unprimed, prepubertal B6CBF(1) mice cultured individually increasing concentrations FSH (0-2000 ng/ml). Following culture, pyruvate, glucose, lactate uptake production individual complexes noninvasively assessed compared stage nuclear maturation enclosed oocyte. FSH significantly increased oocyte maturation produced two- threefold increase glucose uptake lactate production COCs enclosed oocyte completed maturation. COCs, pyruvate taken control conditions produced progressively higher quantities increasing concentrations FSH. COCs oocyte failed complete maturation, pyruvate taken (rather produced) glucose uptake lactate production lower unaffected presence absence FSH. suggests dialogue cumulus cells maturing oocyte influences FSH responsiveness substrate metabolism whole COC. Finally, inhibition FSH-stimulated glucose uptake PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 finding GLUT4 protein granulosa cells suggest FSH increases glucose uptake PI3-kinase-mediated translocation GLUT4 granulosa cell membrane.
