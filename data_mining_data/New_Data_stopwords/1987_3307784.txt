 phospho-oligosaccharide polar head group novel insulin-sensitive glycophospholipid recently involved insulin action. investigated insulin-like effects phospho-oligosaccharide glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate kinase activities hepatocytes incubated presence glucagon (0.1 nM). Similarly insulin, phospho-oligosaccharide antagonized glucagon-dependent activation glycogen phosphorylase, well inactivation pyruvate kinase caused hormone. antagonistic action phospho-oligosaccharide glucagon effects dose-dependent. Furthermore, partially antagonized glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP levels. results support hypothesis phospho-oligosaccharide mediates least insulin actions hepatocytes.
