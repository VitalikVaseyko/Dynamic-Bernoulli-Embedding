 Microsomes prepared livers malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) resistant (MHR) pigs. incubation spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-l-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN), microsomes MHS pigs produced characteristic electron spin resonance (ESR) signal greater rate MHR pigs. Increased formation incubations thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) microsomes MHS pigs indicated enhanced susceptibility free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation. results provide evidence MHS pigs antioxidant abnormality may contribute fatal MH response. However nature abnormality unclear. enhanced formation unstable free radicals indices lipid peroxidation due decreased vitamin E concentration glutathione peroxidase activity microsomes. Furthermore, fatty acid profiles similar microsomes MHS MHR pigs indicating similar amounts potential substrate TBARS formation.
