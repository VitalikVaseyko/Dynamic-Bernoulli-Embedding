 Melatonin potent scavenger reactive oxygen species strong antioxidant. Melatonin exerts protective effects damage enhancing Akt signal pathway, thus regulating apoptotic cell death. Akt phosphorylates pro-apoptotic proteins Bad FoxO1 inhibits pro-apoptotic functions proteins. study investigated protective effects melatonin Akt downstream targets, Bad FoxO1, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) damage. Adult mice subjected 1 h hepatic ischemia 3 h reperfusion. Hepatic ischemia induced occlusions hepatic artery, portal vein, bile duct. Melatonin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) vehicle administrated 15 min prior ischemia reperfusion. Serum aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase levels higher I/R group sham-operated group. Melatonin attenuated increases levels. Moreover, melatonin attenuates injury-induced increases positive TUNEL staining hepatic tissues. Hepatic I/R injury induced reductions Akt up-stream target, PDK1 phosphorylation. levels phospho-Akt, phospho-Bad, phospho-FoxO1 decreased vehicle-treated animals. However, melatonin prevented hepatic I/R injury-induced decreases proteins levels. Moreover, interaction levels phospho-Bad 14-3-3 phospho-FoxO1 14-3-3 reduced vehicle-treated animals, melatonin attenuated decreases binding levels proteins. 14-3-3 exerts anti-apoptotic function sequestration Bad FoxO1. findings suggest melatonin exerts protective effects case hepatic I/R damage maintaining binding phospho-Bad 14-3-3 binding phospho-FoxO1 14-3-3, thus preventing activation apoptotic cell death.
