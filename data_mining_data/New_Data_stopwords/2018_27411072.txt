 Considering Alzheimer's disease prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide, investigated activities three key kinases: creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase adenylate kinase hippocampus cerebral cortex Alzheimer's disease model. Male adult Swiss mice received amyloid-beta saline. One day after, mice treated blank nanocapsules (17 ml/kg) meloxicam-loaded nanocapsules (5 mg/kg) free meloxicam (5 mg/kg). Treatments performed alternating days, end experimental protocol. fourteenth day, kinases activities performed. Amyloid-beta change kinases activity hippocampus cerebral cortex mice. However, free meloxicam decrease creatine kinase activity mitochondrial-rich fraction group induced amyloid-beta, cytosolic fraction, raised activity pyruvate kinase activity cerebral cortex. Further, meloxicam-loaded nanocapsules administration reduced adenylate kinase activity hippocampus mice injected amyloid-beta. conclusion observed absence short-term effects kinases activities energy metabolism mice hippocampus cerebral cortex using amyloid-beta peptide model. findings established foundation study kinases phosphoryltransfer network changes observed brains patients post-mortem Alzheimer's disease.
