 Prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha) multifunctional protein that, mammalian cells, involved nuclear metabolism interaction histones also cytosolic role apoptotic inhibitor. ProTalpha phosphorylated protein kinase (ProTalphaK), activity dependent phosphorylation. ProTalpha phosphorylation also correlates cell proliferation. Mass spectrometric analysis ProTalphaK purified human tumor lymphocytes (NC37 cells) enabled us identify enzyme M2-type isoenzyme pyruvate kinase. study relationship ProTalphaK activity pyruvate kinase isoforms NC37 cells cell types confirmed M2 isoform enzyme responsible ProTalphaK activity proliferating cells. Yet, 10% cellular pool M2 isoform shows specific affinity ProTalpha responsible ProTalphaK activity. pool M2 protein possesses observable pyruvate kinase activity changes responses various effectors pyruvate kinase activity; however, responses PK effectors maintained main cellular fraction containing M2 isoform. Acquisition ProTalphaK activity M2 seems due phosphorylation serine threonine residues, which, besides essential catalytic activity, induces trimeric association ProTalphaK. association shifted tetrameric form fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate, results decrease ProTalphaK activity.
