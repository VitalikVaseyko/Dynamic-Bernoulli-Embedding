 Serial determinations carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels performed full-term newborn infants first days life mothers. close correlation found COHb mother determined cord blood. correlation COHb mother delivery found neonate disappeared 48 h life. determination COHb period demonstrated significantly higher values COHb levels jaundiced neonates compared normal infants. Determinations erythrocyte age-dependent enzyme activities carried birth 5 days life demonstrate significant difference mean values jaundiced normal infants. However, normal infants demonstrated decrease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate-kinase activities birth 5th day appreciable neonates hyperbilirubinemia unknown etiology. results discussed relation role hemolysis neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
