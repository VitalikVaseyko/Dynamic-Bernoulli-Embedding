 specificities pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase probed using synthetic peptides corresponding sequence around phosphorylation sites 1 2 pyruvate dehydrogenase [Tyr-His-Gly-His-Ser(P1)-Met-Ser-Asp-Pro-Gly-Val-Ser(P2)-Tyr-Arg]. dephosphotetradecapeptide containing aspartic acid position 8 better substrate kinase tetradecapeptide containing asparagine position 8. apparent Km V values two peptides 0.43 6.1 mM 2.7 2.4 nmol 32P incorporated/min/mg, respectively. Methylation aspartic acid residue also increased apparent Km tetradecapeptide 14-fold. results indicate acidic residue carboxyl-terminal side phosphorylation site 1 important specificity determinant kinase. Phosphate incorporated site 1 synthetic peptide kinase. phosphatase exhibited apparent Km 0.28 mM V 2.3 mumol 32P released/min/mg phosphorylated tetradecapeptide containing aspartic acid. Methylation aspartic acid residue significant effect dephosphorylation. octapeptide phosphooctapeptide produced cleavage aspartyl-prolyl bond formic acid poorer substrates kinase phosphatase tetradecapeptide phosphotetradecapeptide, respectively. Modification amino terminal acetylation lysine addition slight effect kinase phosphatase activities.
