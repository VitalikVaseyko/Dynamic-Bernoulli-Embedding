 Fractionation Saccharomyces cerevisiae postribosomal extract DEAE-cellulose revealed two fractions cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-1 PKA-2). presence PKA fractions confirmed immunoblotting anti-Bcy1 antibodies. Yeast pyruvate kinase Pyk1 identified amino acid microsequencing analysis immunoblotting anti-Pyk1 antibodies copurified PKA-1 -2 fraction. Pyk1 phosphorylated yeast PKA vitro presence cAMP cGMP. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis revealed four phosphorylated forms Pyk1 modified PKA. phosphorylation Pyk1 mainly Tpk2 catalytic subunit yeast PKA involved.
