 major Mn2+-activated phosphoprotein phosphatase human erythrocyte purified homogeneity cell hemolysate. sensitive inhibitors 1 2 rabbit skeletal muscle, preferentially dephosphorylates beta subunit phosphorylase kinase, dephosphorylates broad range substrates including phosphorylase a, p-nitro-phenyl phosphate, phosphocasein, regulatory subunit cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, spectrin (Km = 10 microM) pyruvate kinase (Km = 18 microM) purified human erythrocyte. purified enzyme stimulated Mn2+ lesser extent higher concentrations Mg2+. purification procedure selected avoid change molecular weight, hence subunit composition, crude purified enzyme. Maintenance original structure demonstrated non-denaturing gel electrophoresis gel filtration chromatography. Gel filtration purified holoenzyme shows single active component Stokes radius 58 molecular weight position 180,000. Sedimentation velocity glycerol gradient gives value 6.1 S20, w. Together data indicate molecular weight 135,000. Two bands equal intensity appear sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis molecular weights 61,700 36,300, suggesting subunit composition two 36,000 one 62,000 subunits. 36-kDa catalytic subunit isolated freezing thawing holoenzyme hydrophobic chromatography holoenzyme. catalytic subunit shows unchanged substrate inhibitor specificity altered metal ion activation.
