 several cell types, mostly epithelial origin, activation cAMP pathway triggers DNA synthesis cell division. Regulation gene expression cAMP involves phosphorylation pyruvate kinase activation cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)/CRE modulator (CREM) transcription factors bind DNA CRE sites. hand, several CREM isoforms transcriptional repressors, inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) transcription factors, synthesized intronic promoter CREM gene. study investigated potential role CREB/CREM transcription factors cAMP mitogenic pathway, using experimental model epithelial cells primary culture, i.e. dog thyroid cells stimulated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). response TSH, CREB/CREM transcription factors phosphorylated serine residue pyruvate kinase consensus site. addition, synthesis ICER mRNAs strongly induced TSH. transient upregulation ICER expression correlated increased protein levels. restricted cAMP pathway, neither epidermal growth factor phorbol myristate acetate, potent mitogens dog thyroid cells, induced ICER expression. hand, increased expression ICER mRNAs detected dog thyroids chronically stimulated TSH vivo. requirement CREB/CREM transcription factors mitogenic effect TSH assessed transfecting expression vectors encoding CREM repressors dog thyrocytes order interfere CRE-mediated gene transcription. ectopic expression ICER Igamma CREM alpha isoforms inhibited DNA replication dog thyrocytes stimulated TSH. inhibitory effect dependent ability CREM repressors form dimers involve DNA-binding capacity. Together results show CREB/CREM transcription factors tightly regulated, transcriptional post-translational levels, TSH dog thyroid cells, provide clear evidence activity required cAMP-dependent proliferation cells primary culture. Moreover, transient induction ICER transcription factors mitogenic stimulation TSH raises questions role potent repressors CRE-dependent transcription timers cellular proliferation.
