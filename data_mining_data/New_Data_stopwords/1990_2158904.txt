 gamma-P adduct ATP 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (ATP-EDC) synthesized incubated Ca-ATPase sarcoplasmic reticulum result time-dependent complete loss enzyme's activity occurred. inactivation required calcium magnesium ATP protective effect. ATP-EDC incubation NaK-ATPase HK-ATPase produced partial (greater 50%) inactivation, effect myosin S1, pyruvate kinase hexokinase, suggesting ATP analog specific inactivator so-called 'P-type' ATPases.
