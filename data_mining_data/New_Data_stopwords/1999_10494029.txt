 renal proximal tubular cells brought tissue culture, revert oxidative metabolism gluconeogenesis high rates glycolysis. Among factors possibly responsible metabolic conversion, limited oxygen availability and/or substrate supply discussed. order study role factors long-term cultures, impact growth conditions, culture media volume, glucose content carbohydrate metabolism continuous renal cell lines LLC-PK(1) (porcine kidney) OK (opossum kidney) investigated. impact culture media volumes glucose content, respectively, determined overlaying confluent monolayer cultures LLC-PK(1) OK cells (i) increasing volumes culture medium thus increasing amounts glucose, (ii) increasing culture medium volumes constant absolute amounts glucose adding glucose-free medium, order increase volume constant glucose supply. Alternatively, order improve cell oxygenation, LLC-PK(1) cells also cultured roller bottles. Cell carbohydrate metabolism assessed measuring rates glucose consumption lactate production, respectively, determination specific activities key glycolytic enzymes hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Mitochondrial phosphate-dependent glutaminase (PDG) assayed marker enzyme oxidative metabolism glutamine. LLC-PK(1) OK cells, rates glucose consumption independent initial glucose concentrations and/or culture media volumes used. Glucose quantitatively converted lactate, accumulated 1:2 molar ratio. Lactate culture media reached maximum content 24 h, reutilized cell lines thereafter. Interestingly, rates lactate reuptake strictly depended culture medium volume, indicating volume-induced stimulation oxidative lactate metabolism. Marked changes found specific activities glycolytic enzymes. LLC-PK(1) cells, increased glucose supply caused increases HK, PFK, PK LDH activities, superimposed stimulatory effects increased media volumes. Enzyme activity showed biphasic response, indicating glucose supply culture media volumes covering cell monolayer factors determining glycolytic rates LLC-PK(1) renal cells. Conversely, OK cells glycolytic enzyme activities decreased increasing culture media volumes constant glucose levels. expected, conditions enhanced oxygenation LLC-PK(1) cells roller bottle culture, glycolytic enzyme activities decreased, whereas PDG activity increased, paralleled increased rates ammonia generation. Thus, changes nutrient supply oxygenation renal epithelial cell cultures altered culture media volumes dramatically influence metabolic rates levels enzyme activities, respectively.
