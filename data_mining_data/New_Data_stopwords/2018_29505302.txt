 Prostate cancer (PCa) represents one common solid neoplasms, metastasis second leading cause death adult males. Anoikis programmed cell death induced upon cell detachment extracellular matrix (ECM), behaves critical protective mechanism anchorage-independent cell growth metastasis formation. However, absence ECM attachment, shift metabolic pattern tolerance anoikis facilitate survival aggressive cancer cells circulatory system well metastasis distant sites. molecular targets PCa thus far reported prevent anoikis resistance, metabolic reprogramming, metastasis simultaneously. present study, elevated migration, invasion, pyruvate production, lactate generation, ATP level, impaired detachment-induced apoptosis found anoikis-resistant PCa cells, genome microarray analysis demonstrated cell migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) potential molecular target regulation aforementioned malignant behaviors. Additional investigation revealed AMPK/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta)/beta-catenin cascade-triggered CEMIP overexpression anoikis-resistant PCa cells might implicated local progression, metabolic shift, cellular migration invasion, whereas knockout CEMIP clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 anoikis-resistant PCa cells reversed described bioeffects reducing expressions matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), VEGF, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4), lactate dehydrogenase A. addition, inhibition glycolysis CEMIP-mediated PDK4 down-regulation impaired migration invasion anoikis-resistant PCa cells attenuating MMP2 VEGF expressions. findings establish AMPK/GSK3beta/beta-catenin cascade-triggered CEMIP overexpression might promote migration invasion anoikis-resistant PCa cells enhancing PDK4-associated metabolic reprogramming, may provide novel, promising therapeutic target treatment advanced PCa.-Zhang, P., Song, Y., Sun, Y., Li, X., Chen, L., Yang, L., Xing, Y. AMPK/GSK3beta/beta-catenin cascade-triggered overexpression CEMIP promotes migration invasion anoikis-resistant prostate cancer cells enhancing metabolic reprogramming.
