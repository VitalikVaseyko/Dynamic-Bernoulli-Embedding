 Lysates protoplasts endosperm developing grains wheat (Triticum aestivum) fractionated density gradients Nycodenz give amyloplasts. Enzyme distribution gradients suggested that: (i) starch synthase ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase confined amyloplasts; (ii) pyrophosphate: fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase confined cytosol; (iii) significant proportion (23-45%) glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglucomutase pyruvate kinase inclusive, amyloplast. Starch synthase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase glycolytic enzymes showed appreciable latency assayed unfractionated lysates protoplasts. activity fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase found amyloplasts homogenates endosperm. Antibody plastidic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase react positively, immunoblot analysis, protein extracts wheat endosperm. argued wheat endosperm lacks significant plastidic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase carbon starch synthesis enter amyloplast C-3 compound probably hexose phosphate.
