 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) neurodevelopmental disorder behaviorally defined social communication impairments restricted interests repetitive behaviors. currently biomarkers help diagnosis. Several studies suggest mitochondrial dysfunction commonly involved ASD pathophysiology, standard mitochondrial biomarkers thought variable. present study examine wide variety plasma biomarkers mitochondrial metabolism related abnormalities oxidative stress apoptosis 41 ASD patients assessed ASD severity using Childhood Autism Rating Scales 41 non-related age sex matched healthy controls. findings confirm previous studies indicating abnormal mitochondrial related biomarkers children ASD including pyruvate, creatine kinase, Complex 1, Glutathione S-Transferase, glutathione Caspase 7. novel finding, report lactate dehydrogenase abnormal children ASD. also identified severe children demonstrated abnormalities Complex 1 activity Glutathione S-Transferase. Additionally, find several biomarkers could candidates differentiating children ASD typically developing children, including Caspase 7, gluthatione Glutathione S-Transferase lactate dehydrogenase Complex added biomarkers combination. Caspase 7 discriminating biomarker ASD patients healthy controls suggesting potential use diagnostic marker early recognition ASD pathophysiology. study confirms several mitochondrial biomarkers abnormal children ASD suggest certain mitochondrial biomarkers differentiate ASD typically developing children, making possibly useful tool diagnosis ASD identify ASD subgroups.
