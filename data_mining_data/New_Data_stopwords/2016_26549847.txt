 Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) rare erythroid metabolic disease caused mutations PKLR gene. Erythrocytes PKD patients show energetic imbalance causing chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, pyruvate kinase defects impair ATP production erythrocytes. generated PKD induced pluripotent stem cells (PKDiPSCs) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MNCs) PKD patients non-integrative Sendai viral vectors. PKDiPSCs gene edited integrate partial codon-optimized R-type pyruvate kinase cDNA second intron PKLR gene TALEN-mediated homologous recombination (HR). Notably, found allele specificity HR led presence single-nucleotide polymorphism. High numbers erythroid cells derived gene-edited PKDiPSCs showed correction energetic imbalance, providing approach correct metabolic erythroid diseases demonstrating practicality approach generate large cell numbers required comprehensive biochemical metabolic erythroid analyses.
