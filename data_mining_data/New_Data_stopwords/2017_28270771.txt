 Prostate cancer one common types cancer western country males mechanisms involved transformation processes clearly elucidated. Alteration cellular metabolism cancer cells recognized hallmark malignant transformation, although becoming clear biological features metabolic reprogramming differ different cancers, also among different cells type cancer. Normal prostate epithelial cells peculiar inefficient energy metabolism use glucose synthesize citrate secreted part seminal liquid. transformation process, prostate cancer cells modify energy metabolism inefficient highly efficient, often taking advantage interaction cell types tumor microenvironment corrupted produce secrete metabolic intermediates used cancer cells catabolic anabolic processes. recapitulate metabolic transformations occurring prostate normal cell metastasis, highlighting role microenvironment summarizing known molecular mechanisms involved process.
