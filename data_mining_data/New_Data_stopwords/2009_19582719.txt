 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) commonly used chemotherapeutic agent colorectal cancer (CRC). However, resistance drug major obstacle CRC chemotherapy. Accurate prediction response 5-FU would avoid unnecessary chemotherapy allow selection effective drugs. identify candidate predictor 5-FU resistance, isolated secreted proteins up- downregulated 5-FU-resistant cancer cell line, compared parent cell line (SNU-C4), using stable isotope-coded labeling protocol. validating clinical applicability method, levels identified proteins determined sera 46 patients treated 5-FU. total, 238 proteins molecular weights ranging 50 75 kDa identified. Among these, 45 35 secreted proteins up- downregulated 5-FU-resistant cell line, respectively. observed significant upregulation glycolytic enzymes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase M2 (PK-M2), transketolase, NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme 1. particular, level PK-M2, key enzyme glycolytic pathway, showed increasing tendency sera tissues CRC patients displaying response 5-FU-based chemotherapy (progressive stable disease cases), compared complete partial responders 5-FU-based chemotherapy; however, reach statistical significance. conclusion, increasing pattern PK-M2 observed 5-FU resistance induced vitro sera tissues CRC patients displaying poor response 5-FU-based chemotherapy suggest relevance dysregulated glycolysis 5-FU-resistant CRC.
