 Pyravate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-0 phosphotransferase E.C.2.7.1.40) purified Brochothrix thermosphacta. enzyme homotetramer monomer Mr 58,000. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate stimulates activity promotes hyperbolic kinetics although essential enzyme activity. positive effect fructose-1,6-bisphosphate activity repressed inorganic phosphate enhances cooperative kinetics. Unlike pyruvate kinases sources, Brochothrix enzyme uncompetitively inhibited glucose-6-phosphate, although high concentration. ATP strong inhibitor pyruvate kinase shifts residual activity/pH profile towards alkaline values.
