 study aimed investigating extracellular cell wall-associated proteins (exoproteome) Lactobacillus plantarum DC400 cultivated modified chemically defined medium (CDM) supplemented chemically synthesized pheromone plantaricin (PlnA) cocultured L. plantarum DPPMA20 Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DPPMA174. Compared monoculture, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis showed exoproteome L. plantarum DC400 affected PlnA cocultivation strains DPPMA20 and, especially, DPPMA174. highest similarity 2-DE maps found DC400 cells cultivated monoculture coculture strain DPPMA20. Almost extracellular proteins (22 spots) cell wall-associated proteins (40 spots) showed decreased increased levels synthesis growth CDM supplemented PlnA and/or coculture strain DPPMA20 DPPMA174 identified. basis sequences Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes Genomes database, changes exoproteome concerned proteins involved quorum sensing (QS), transport system, stress response, carbohydrate metabolism glycolysis, oxidation/reduction processes, proteolytic system, amino acid metabolism, cell wall catabolic processes, cell shape, growth, division. Cultivation PlnA cocultivation strains DPPMA20 and, especially, DPMMA174 markedly increased capacity L. plantarum DC400 form biofilms, adhere human Caco-2 cells, prevent adhesion potential intestinal pathogens. phenotypic traits part related oversynthesized moonlighting proteins (e.g., DnaK GroEL, pyruvate kinase, enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) response QS mechanisms interaction L. plantarum DPPMA20 and, especially, L. sanfranciscensis DPPMA174.
