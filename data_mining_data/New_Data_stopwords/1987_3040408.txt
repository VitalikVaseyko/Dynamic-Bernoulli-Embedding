 Changes glycolytic flux observed liver conditions effects cAMP seem unlikely. have, therefore, studied phosphorylation four enzymes involved regulation glycolysis gluconeogenesis (6-phosphofructo-1-kinase rat liver rabbit muscle; pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase rat liver) defined concentrations two cAMP-independent protein kinases: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). results compared obtained catalytic subunit cAMP-dependent protein kinase. following results obtained. 1. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase L-type pyruvate kinase slightly lower rate compared cAMP-dependent protein kinase. 2. 6-Phosphofructo-1-kinase phosphorylated two kinases single identical position. additive phosphorylation. final stoichiometry 2 mol phosphate/mol tetramer. holds L-type pyruvate kinase except stoichiometry either kinase kinases together 4 mol phosphate/mol tetramer. 3. Rabbit muscle 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase phosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. 4. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase rat rabbit liver phosphorylated position markedly lower rate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase compared phosphorylation cAMP-dependent protein kinase. 5. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase negligible rate. 6. Protein kinase C seem involved regulation enzymes examined: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase became phosphorylated significant degree. contrast phosphorylation cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylation associated change enzyme activity. agrees observation sites phosphorylation two kinases different. results indicate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase protein kinase C could involved regulation hepatic glycolytic flux conditions changes activity cAMP-dependent protein kinase seem unlikely.
