 Glucose required efficient expression glucose transporter GLUT2 genes. shown previously intracytoplasmic loop GLUT2 divert signal, resulting stimulation glucose-sensitive gene transcription. present study, interaction GLUT2 loop, cloned rat karyopherin alpha2, receptor involved nuclear import. specificity binding restricted GLUT2, GLUT1 GLUT4, karyopherin alpha2, alpha1. rendered irreversible cross-linking agent, transitory interaction detected vivo hepatocytes. role karyopherin alpha2 transcription two glucose-sensitive genes investigated transfection native inactive green fluorescent protein-karyopherin alpha2 GLUT2-expressing hepatoma cells. amount inactive karyopherin alpha2 receptor reduced, dose-dependent manner, GLUT2 liver pyruvate kinase mRNA levels competition endogenous active receptor. contrast, overexpression karyopherin alpha2 significantly stimulate GLUT2 liver pyruvate kinase mRNA accumulation green fluorescent protein-sorted cells. present study suggests that, concert glucose metabolism, karyopherin alpha2 transmits signal nucleus regulate glucose-sensitive gene expression. transitory tethering karyopherin alpha2 GLUT2 plasma membrane might indicate receptor load cargo imported locally.
