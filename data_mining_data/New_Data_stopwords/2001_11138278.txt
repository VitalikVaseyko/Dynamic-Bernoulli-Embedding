 Tumor cell metabolism characterized high rate aerobic glycolysis. metabolic differences require changes glycolytic enzyme activities isoenzyme patterns. inactive form M2 pyruvate kinase (Tu M2-PK) specifically expressed tumor cells detected immunohistochemically tumor tissue also peripheral blood patients different malignant tumors. study, Tu M2-PK plasma patients renal cell carcinoma (RCC) compared healthy volunteers. Tu M2-PK quantified commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Using ELISA kit, plasma probes 57 healthy individuals compared 63 patients RCC (51 patients non-metastatic RCC, 12 patients metastatic RCC). Statistical analysis performed non-parametric ANOVA test according Kruskal-Wallis. patients renal cell carcinoma, Tu M2-PK significantly higher healthy volunteers. organ-defined, non-metastatic tumors, sensitivity 27.5%, 95% reference values control group used discrimination. differences pronounced patients metastatic disease. Tu M2-PK significantly enhanced compared healthy controls, also group non-metastatic disease, sensitivity 66.7%. data show Tu M2-PK impact unspecific marker diagnosis renal cell carcinoma. especially relevant organ-defined, non-metastatic RCC. advanced metastatic disease, potential importance parameter treatment control palliative therapeutic approaches assumed, warrants investigations.
