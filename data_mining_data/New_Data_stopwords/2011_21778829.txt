 Previously, proposed cancer cells behave metabolic parasites, use targeted oxidative stress "weapon" extract recycled nutrients adjacent stromal cells. Oxidative stress cancer-associated fibroblasts triggers autophagy mitophagy, resulting compartmentalized cellular catabolism, loss mitochondrial function, onset aerobic glycolysis, tumor stroma. such, cancer-associated fibroblasts produce high-energy nutrients (such lactate ketones) fuel mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative metabolism cancer cells. termed new energy-transfer mechanism "reverse Warburg effect." test validity hypothesis, used vitro MCF7-fibroblast co-culture system, quantitatively measured variety metabolic parameters FACS analysis (analogous laser-capture micro-dissection). Mitochondrial activity, glucose uptake, ROS production measured highly-sensitive fluorescent probes (MitoTracker, NBD-2-deoxy-glucose, DCF-DA). Interestingly, using approach, directly show cancer cells initially secrete hydrogen peroxide triggers oxidative stress neighboring fibroblasts. Thus, oxidative stress contagious (spreads like virus) propagated laterally vectorially cancer cells adjacent fibroblasts. Experimentally, show oxidative stress cancer-associated fibroblasts quantitatively reduces mitochondrial activity, increases glucose uptake, fibroblasts become dependent aerobic glycolysis. Conversely, co-cultured cancer cells show significant increases mitochondrial activity, corresponding reductions glucose uptake GLUT1 expression. Pre-treatment co-cultures extracellular catalase (an anti-oxidant enzyme detoxifies hydrogen peroxide) blocks onset oxidative stress, potently induces death cancer cells, likely via starvation. Given cancer-associated fibroblasts show largest increases glucose uptake, suggest PET imaging human tumors, Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-2-DG), may specifically detecting tumor stroma, rather epithelial cancer cells.
