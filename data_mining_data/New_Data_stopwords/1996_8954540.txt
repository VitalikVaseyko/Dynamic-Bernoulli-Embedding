 paper describes rapid efficient procedure enzymatic synthesis 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phospho[35S]sulfate ([35S]PAPS). [35S]PAPS synthesized incubating ATP carrier-free [35S]-Na2(35)SO4 ATP sulfurylase, recombinant APS kinase inorganic pyrophosphatase. transfer 35SO4 group [35S]Na2SO4 [35S]PAPS proceeded efficiently presence ATP-regenerating system composed pyruvate kinase phosphoenol pyruvate. 90% radioactivity present starting material [35S]Na2SO4 transferred [35S]PAPS within 2-h reaction incubation. reaction products applied Mono Q column, [35S]PAPS eluted step-wise gradient triethylamine bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.5). conditions, [35S]PAPS eluted sharp peak 0.7 triethylammonium bicarbonate well separated contaminants. purified [35S]PAPS (yield 85%, purity > 95%) functional donating sulfate oligosaccharide acceptor standard sulfotransferase reaction. enzymatic procedure described particularly useful synthesis [35S]PAPS wide range concentrations specific activities (up 1500 Ci/mmol). generally useful approach also found successful syntheses 8-azido 8-bromo derivatives [35S]PAPS. Applications two derivatives PAPS, purification identification sulfotransferases, also discussed.
