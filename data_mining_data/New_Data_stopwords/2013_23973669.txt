 tolerance cancer cells hypoxia depends combination different factors--from increase glycolysis (Warburg Effect) activation intracellular growth/apoptotic pathways. Less known influence epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) EMT-associated pathways cell sensitivity hypoxia. aim study explore role Snail signaling, one key EMT pathways, mediating hypoxia response regulation cell sensitivity hypoxia, using model vitro cultured breast cancer cells. Earlier shown estrogen-independent HBL-100 breast cancer cells differ estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells increased expression Snail1, demonstrated Snail1 involvement formation hormone-resistant phenotype. Snail1 belongs hypoxia-activated proteins, studied influence Snail1 signaling cell tolerance hypoxia. found Snail1-enriched HBL-100 cells less sensitive hypoxia-induced growth suppression compared MCF-7 line (31% MCF-7 vs. 71% HBL-100 cell viability 1% O2 atmosphere 3 days). Snail1 knock-down enhanced hypoxia-induced inhibition cell proliferation giving direct evidence Snail1 involvement cell protection hypoxia attack. protective effect Snail1 shown mediated, least part, via beta-catenin positively regulated expression HIF-1-dependent genes. Finally, found cell tolerance hypoxia accompanied failure phosphorylation AMPK - key energy sensor, demonstrated inverse relationship AMPK Snail/beta-catenin signaling. Totally, data show Snail1 beta-catenin, besides association loss hormone dependence, protect cancer cells hypoxia may serve important target treatment breast cancer. Moreover, suggest level proteins well level AMPK phosphorylation may considered predictors tumor sensitivity anti-angiogenic drugs.
