 synthesis 2-acetylthiamin pyrophosphate (acetyl-TPP) described. synthesis compound accomplished 23 degrees C oxidation 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)thiamin pyrophosphate using aqueous chromic acid oxidizing agent conditions Cr(III) coordination pyrophosphoryl moiety hydrolysis pyrophosphate acetyl moieties prevented. Although chemical properties exhibited acetyl-TPP similar 2-acetyl-3,4-dimethylthiazolium ion examined Lienhard [Lienhard, G.E. (1966) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 88, 5642-5649], significant differences exist pyrimidine ring acetyl-TPP. Characterization acetyl-TPP ultraviolet spectroscopy, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 31P NMR provided evidence compound aqueous solution exists equilibrium mixture keto, hydrate, intramolecular carbinolamine forms. equilibria hydration carbinolamine formation reactions pD 1.3 determined 1H NMR strongly dependent temperature, showing increase hydrate carbinolamine forms expense keto form decreasing temperature. concentration keto form also decreases increasing pH. Acetyl-TPP stable aqueous acid rapidly deacetylates higher pH form acetate thiamin pyrophosphate. Trapping acetyl moiety aqueous solution occurs efficiently 1.0 hydroxylamine pH 5.5-6.5 form acetohydroxamic acid much smaller extent 1.0 2-mercaptoethanol pH 4.0 5.0 form thio ester. Transfer acetyl group 0.5 dihydrolipoic acid pH 5.0 1.0 phosphate dianion pH 7.0 observed significant extent water. kinetic thermodynamic reactivity acetyl-TPP water nucleophiles compatible hypothetical role acyl-TPPs enzymatic acyl-transfer intermediates.
