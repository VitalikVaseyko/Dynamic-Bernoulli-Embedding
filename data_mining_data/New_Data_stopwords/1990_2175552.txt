 mammary gland tissue extremely sensitive insulin lactation; weaning, effect insulin rapidly abolished. purpose study characterize mammary gland insulin receptors kinase activity lactating weaned mammary gland. apparent molecular weight alpha-subunit slightly lower mammary gland liver white adipose tissue (127,000 vs. 134,000), apparent molecular weight beta-subunit similar three tissues (95,000). Insulin induced 10-fold increase beta-subunit autophosphorylation, half-maximal effect achieved 2 nM insulin. 24 h weaning, number insulin receptors decreased 30%, kinase activity beta-subunit unchanged. euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, insulin entirely activated pyruvate dehydrogenase lactating rat mammary gland, whereas 24 h weaning unable increase proportion enzyme active form. results suggest site alteration action insulin mammary gland weaning distal receptor.
