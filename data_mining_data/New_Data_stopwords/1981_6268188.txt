 1. Epinephrine, isoproterenol phenylephrine increases significantly gluconeogenesis (from dihydroxy-acetone D-fructose) glycogenolysis added hepatocytes 48-h fasted rabbits. stimulation processes epinephrine, isoproterenol phenylephrine negated beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol remains significant presence alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. Conversely, previous data suggest catecholamine-induced stimulation glucose formation L-lactate alpha- beta-adrenergic-sensitive. 2. Glucagon, epinephrine, isoproterenol, phenylephrine dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibits significantly pyruvate kinase activity rabbit hepatocytes. Inhibition pyruvate kinase activity epinephrine, isoproterenol phenylephrine negated propranolol insensitive phentolamine. 3. observations suggest enhancement epinephrine glucose formation either dihydroxyacetone D-fructose solely beta-adrenergic-regulated, inhibition pyruvate kinase activity. Stimulation gluconeogenesis glucagon, epinephrine, isoproterenol, phenylephrine dibutyryl cyclic AMP may least part directly related ability inhibit pyruvate kinase.
