 effect glucose concentration insulin glucose incorporation studied primary cultures rat hepatocytes. rate glucose incorporation hepatocytes proportional medium glucose concentration 100 800 mg/dl. 800 mg/dl glucose rate reached plateau. glucose taken hepatocytes, 16 18% incorporated glycogen lipid, respectively, 58% nucleotide fraction incubation 4 h. medium, lactate major product found. Insulin stimulates glucose incorporation 20-112% pathways glucose concentrations 100 800 mg/dl. insulin effect noted early 2-4 h (early effect) 24 h (delayed effect). effect insulin observed dose dependent 5 200 ng/ml insulin. delayed insulin effect abolished cycloheximide, early effect insulin affected. respect key enzyme activities glucose utilization, activation glycogen synthase (increase I-activity/total activity) pyruvate kinase (activation 0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate) noted 4 h insulin addition, effects abolished cycloheximide. two enzymes increased total activity 24 h. glucokinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities increased 30-35% 65-93% 4 24 h, respectively. results indicate hepatocytes directly utilize glucose dose-dependent manner respect glucose insulin. major early delayed effect insulin appeared due activation induction key hepatic enzymes glucose utilization, respectively.
