 BACKGROUND: increasing evidence oncogenic Wnt signaling directs metabolic reprogramming cancer cells favor aerobic glycolysis Warburg metabolism. colon cancer, reprogramming due direct regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) gene transcription. Additional metabolism genes sensitive Wnt signaling exhibit correlative expression PDK1. Whether genes also regulated transcriptional level, therefore part core metabolic gene program targeted oncogenic WNT signaling, known. RESULTS: Here, identify monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1; encoded SLC16A1) direct target gene supporting Wnt-driven Warburg metabolism. identify validate Wnt response elements (WREs) proximal SLC16A1 promoter show mediate sensitivity Wnt inhibition via dominant-negative LEF-1 (dnLEF-1) expression small molecule Wnt inhibitor XAV939. also show WREs function independent additive manner c-Myc, known oncogenic regulator SLC16A1 transcription. MCT-1 export lactate, byproduct Warburg metabolism, essential transporter pyruvate well glycolysis-targeting cancer drug, 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP). Using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays follow cell proliferation, tested panel colon cancer cell lines sensitivity 3-BP. observe cell lines highly sensitive reduction Wnt signaling XAV939 treatment synergize 3-BP, instead protective promotes rapid recovery. CONCLUSIONS: conclude MCT-1 part core Wnt signaling gene program glycolysis colon cancer modulation program could play important role shaping sensitivity drugs target cancer metabolism.
