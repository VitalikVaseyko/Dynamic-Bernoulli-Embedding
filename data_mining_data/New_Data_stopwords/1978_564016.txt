 investigation carbohydrate energy metabolism Rhabdias bufonis, lung-dwelling nematode parasite African toad, Bufo regularis, indicates nematode stores little glycogen (0.137 +/- 0.003% fresh weight basis) utilize oxygen vitro. intracellular distribution high levels activity observed enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme fumarate reductase suggest two alternative pathways carbohydrate energy metabolism.
