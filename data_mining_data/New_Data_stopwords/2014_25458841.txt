 Cancer cells typically subject profound metabolic alterations, including Warburg effect wherein cancer cells oxidize decreased fraction pyruvate generated glycolysis. show herein mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), composed products MPC1 MPC2 genes, modulates fractional pyruvate oxidation. MPC1 deleted underexpressed multiple cancers correlates poor prognosis. Cancer cells re-expressing MPC1 MPC2 display increased mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, changes cell growth adherent culture. MPC re-expression exerted profound effects anchorage-independent growth conditions, however, including impaired colony formation soft agar, spheroid formation, xenograft growth. also observed decrease markers stemness traced growth effects MPC expression stem cell compartment. propose reduced MPC activity important aspect cancer metabolism, perhaps altering maintenance fate stem cells.
