 major glucose-consuming organ human body, dynamics glucose metabolism brain deserve special attention. shown brain's energy allocation percentage total energy budget individual peaks childhood declines adolescence reaching stable allocation level seen adult. pattern glucose consumption observed species, including close primate relatives, therefore potentially either driver consequence human cognition. Furthermore, allocation glucose usage brain changes individual ages, surprising amount dedicated glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation pathway. suggests that, certain developmental stages, glucose-fuelled anabolic pathways, addition ATP generation, driving forces behind brain's high energy requirement. study, explore recent work pertaining dynamic glucose uptake allocation developing human brain investigate several genes may play role regulating processes.
