 Aberrant expression microRNA (miR)-1 observed many human malignancies. However, function underlying mechanism miR-1 remains elusive. address specific role miR-1 tumor glycolysis using gain- loss-of-function studies. Metabolic studies combined gene expression analysis performed vitro vivo. demonstrated aberrant expression miR-1 aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, cancer cells. MiR-1 suppressed aerobic glycolysis tumor cell proliferation via inactivation Smad3 targeting HIF-1alpha, leading reduce HK2 MCT4 expression, illustrated novel pathway mediate aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. Overexpression miR-1 mimics significantly decreased tumor glycolysis, including lactate production glucose uptake, cell proliferation, effects reversed ectopic expression Smad3. Importantly, endogenous Smad3 regulated interacted HIF-1alpha, resulting increasing activity Smad3, interaction dramatically abolished addition miR-1. demonstrated Smad3 central effects miR-1 colorectal cancer cells, establishing previously unappreciated mechanism miR-1/Smad3/HIF-1alpha axis facilitates Warburg effect promote cancer progression vitro vivo. results indicate miR-1 may essential role tumor suppressor, suggesting potential role molecular therapy patients advanced colorectal cancer.
