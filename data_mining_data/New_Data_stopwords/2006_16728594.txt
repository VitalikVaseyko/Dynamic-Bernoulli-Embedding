 energy sustains cancer cells derived preferentially glycolysis. metabolic change, Warburg effect, one first alterations cancer cells recognized conferring survival advantage. Here, show p53, one frequently mutated genes cancers, modulates balance utilization respiratory glycolytic pathways. identify Synthesis Cytochrome c Oxidase 2 (SCO2) downstream mediator effect mice human cancer cell lines. SCO2 critical regulating cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex, major site oxygen utilization eukaryotic cell. Disruption SCO2 gene human cancer cells wild-type p53 recapitulated metabolic switch toward glycolysis exhibited p53-deficient cells. SCO2 couples p53 mitochondrial respiration provides possible explanation Warburg effect offers new clues p53 might affect aging metabolism.
