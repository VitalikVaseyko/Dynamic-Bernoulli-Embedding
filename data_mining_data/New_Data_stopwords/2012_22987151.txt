 well known hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha) detectable adaptive metabolic response hypoxia. However, HIF1/HIF1alpha detectable even normoxic conditions, metabolism altered, e.g., high proliferation index. Importantly, hypoxic metabolism Warburg effect common decrease intracellular pH value. interpretation, HIF1alpha directly accumulated hypoxia, process occurs always hypoxic conditions, decrease intracellular pH value metabolic imbalances. assume HIF1alpha sensitive controller intracellular pH value independently oxygen concentration. Moreover, HIF1alpha major role activating genes eliminate toxic metabolic waste products (e.g., NH3/NH4+) generated tumor-specific metabolism called glutaminolysis, occur hypoxia, Warburg effect. reason, HIF1alpha appears potential target tumor therapy disturb pH balance inhibit elimination toxic metabolic waste products tumor cells.
