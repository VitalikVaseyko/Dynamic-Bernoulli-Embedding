 effect free radical scavengers free radical-induced myocardial injury heart preservation transplantation examined. Four groups nine hearts harvested mongrel dogs (12.5 16.5 kg) orthotopically transplanted size-matched recipients. hearts received continuous perfusion oxygenated modified Collins' solution (group A). addition, groups B, C, received Fluosol DA albumin. Preservation perfusion performed 18 hours, 4 degrees C, pH = 7.4, 20 mm Hg. group C, recombinant human superoxide dismutase (4,080 U/mg, 20 mg/kg) bovine catalase (46,200 U/mg, 20 mg/kg) administered preservation perfusion. group D, scavengers administered reperfusion 1 hour. Hemodynamic studies performed excision donor hearts 1 hour termination cardiopulmonary bypass. Creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels coronary effluent determined preservation perfusion reperfusion. group showed significant heart weight gain (p less 0.05) decline passive compliance (p less 0.05) preservation. Lactate release higher group groups receiving Fluosol DA. contrast, pyruvate levels group lower groups. generation free radicals stayed low level preservation, significantly increased reperfusion associated corresponding increase creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme. Perfusion perfluorochemical solution (group B) inhibited sharp rise levels thiobarbituric acid reactive substances creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme improved cardiac function reperfusion (versus group A). Exogeneous free radical scavengers administered reperfusion (group D) significantly ameliorated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme levels also induced significant hemodynamic improvement reperfusion. However, administration scavengers preservation not. study demonstrates generation free radicals primarily significant reperfusion reoxygenation ischemia. Thus best time administration scavengers onset reperfusion. Furthermore, perfusion perfluorochemicals effectively maintains aerobic metabolism ameliorates free radical damage period.
