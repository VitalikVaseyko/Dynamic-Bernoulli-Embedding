 membrane potential tonoplast-free cells Nitellopsis obtusa Graves relation intracellulcar concentration ATP ([ATP])i measured using either ordinary microelectrode method open-vacuole method (M. Tazawa, M. Kikuyama S. Nakagawa, 1975, Plant Cell Physiol. 16, 611). intracellular ATP concentration modified microelectrode method introducing cell ATP-regenerating media composed phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase, open-vacuole method continuously perfusing cell interior media known ATP concentrations. Plots membrane potential [ATP]i follow rectangular hyperbola. Using microelectrode method, maximum ATP-dependent potential about-120-130 mV apparent K 10-30 muM. openvacuole method used, maximum ATP-dependent potential 100 mV apparent K 100 muM. membrane still excitable [ATP]i 10 muM 1.7 muM [ATP]i. membrane resistance increased parallel decrease [ATP]i membrane depolarization, decreased low [ATP]i (1.7 muM).
