 Serotonergic neuronal networks important food intake body weight regulation. Dexfenfluramine (dF), serotonin releaser reuptake inhibitor, used investigate changes food intake, body weight development, energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, substrate oxidation rates 12 days. Rats, made obese early postnatal overfeeding, received energy-controlled mash diet water ad lib intraperitoneally injected daily either saline, 5 10 mg dF/kg. Compared controls, food intake, body weight development, energy expenditure decreased dose-dependent manner, especially first 6 days. Lipid oxidation increased oxidation carbohydrates decreased. Pair-feeding experiments 2 days revealed solely result diminished food intake also additional metabolic effect dF, different anorectic effect. end experiments, plasma glucose liver glycogen unchanged dF, plasma free fatty acids significantly decreased. Insulin-sensitivity probably improved, indicated decreased insulin levels increases muscle glycogen contents activities muscle pyruvate kinase. Liver-glutamine contents valine, leucine, isoleucine muscle significantly decreased dF-treatment, latter indicating diminished proteolysis. plasma tryptophan/large neutral amino acids ratio dF-rats unchanged paired-fed rats changed, despite similar changes food intake. concluded increased oxidation endogenous fat reduced food intake could mediate body weight reducing effect dF.
