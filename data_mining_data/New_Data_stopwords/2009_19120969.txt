 control phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae), vectors leishmaniasis, directed mostly adults larvae develop unknown inaccessible habitats. current study tested geraniol, natural plant-derived product, space repellent synthetic pyrethroid prallethrin diffusible insecticide. Geraniol dispersed air using diffusers electric fan prallethrin evaporated using electrically heated evaporators. substances tested inhabited bedrooms tents. Geraniol failed effect significant reductions numbers either Phlebotomus papatasi Scopoli rooms Phlebotomus sergenti Parrot tents. laboratory experiments, geraniol proved ineffective preventing sandflies feeding. contrast, prallethrin highly effective reducing number sandflies rooms well tents. Exposure sandflies prallethrin laboratory experiments caused 97% mortality rates. prallethrin and, lesser extent, geraniol reduced number Culex mosquitoes captured tents. Electric liquid-vaporizers 1.5% prallethrin highly effective protecting people sandfly bites confined spaces may useful combating cutaneous leishmaniasis.
