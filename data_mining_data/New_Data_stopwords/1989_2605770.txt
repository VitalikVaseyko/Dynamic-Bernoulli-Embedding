 Rat liver nonparenchymal cells (NPC) prepared pronase digestion purified discontinuous gradients Nycodenz. Morphological biochemical characterization cell suspensions showed free contamination hepatocytes. confirmed usefulness pyruvate kinase activity monitoring degree hepatocyte contamination NPC derived equation allows carry-over calculated. Using highly purified suspensions NPC shown contain glucose-6-phosphatase low detectable levels. Spectrophotometric studies showed contain cytochrome P450, specific content 24 +/- 5 pmole mg-1 cell protein. potential source error previous studies recognized; namely peroxidase, present NPC high concentration, able mask absorption due cytochrome P450. presence inducibility enzyme NPC prepared rats pretreated phenobarbital 3-methylcholanthrene confirmed using Western blot analysis.
