 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 abundant nuclear protein plays important role pre-mRNA processing mRNA export nucleus. A1 shuttles rapidly nucleus cytoplasm, 38-amino acid domain, M9, serves bidirectional transport signal A1. Recently, 90-kD protein, transportin, identified mediator A1 nuclear import. study, show transportin mediates nuclear import additional hnRNP proteins, including hnRNP F. also isolated sequenced novel transportin homolog, transportin2, may differ transportin1 substrate specificity. Immunostaining shows transportin1 localized cytoplasm nucleoplasm, nuclear rim staining also observed. nuclear localization A1 dependent ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription. Interestingly, pyruvate kinase-M9 fusion, normally localizes nucleus, also accumulates cytoplasm RNA polymerase II inhibited. Thus, M9 specific sensor transcription-dependent nuclear transport. Transportin1-A1 complexes isolated cytoplasm nucleoplasm, transportin1 detectable hnRNP complexes. RanGTP causes dissociation A1-transportin1 complexes vitro. Thus, likely nuclear import, A1 dissociates transportin1 RanGTP becomes incorporated hnRNP complexes, A1 functions pre-mRNA processing.
