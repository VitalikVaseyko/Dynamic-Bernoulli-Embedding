 Aquatic terrestrial crustaceans dependent aerobic anaerobic metabolism energy production exercise. Anaerobic energy production marked accumulation lactate muscle tissue haemolymph, metabolic fate lactate clear. Lactate recycling via gluconeogenesis potential role carbonic anhydrase (CA) supplying bicarbonate carboxylation pyruvate investigated three species decapod crustaceans: Callinectes sapidus (aquatic), Cardisoma guanhumi (semi-terrestrial) Gecarcinus lateralis (terrestrial). CA activity found mitochondria cytoplasmic fractions gill, hepatopancreas muscle three species. Significant activities key enzymes gluconeogenesis (e.g. pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase fructose bisphosphatase), however, could detected. Exercise exhaustion produced species-specific pattern accumulation clearance lactate tissue haemolymph, indicating differential degree reliance anaerobic energy production. Treatment acetazolamide, CA inhibitor, significantly alter pattern lactate dynamics animals given repeated bouts exhaustive exercise interspersed periods recovery. Injection [U-14C]lactate resulted appearance label muscle glycogen excreted carbon dioxide, suggesting multiple metabolic fates lactate. Lactate turnover rates G. lateralis similar reported fish. animals, gluconeogenesis possibly proceeds via reversal pyruvate kinase, via typical Cori cycle slowly uncatalysed supply bicarbonate sufficient keep pace low activities pyruvate carboxylase subsequent low rates pyruvate carboxylation.
