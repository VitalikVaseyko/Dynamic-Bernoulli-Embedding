 Targeted cancer therapies use genetics successful, principles selectively targeting tumor metabolism also dependent environment remain unknown. show differences rate-controlling enzymes Warburg effect (WE), prominent hallmark cancer cell metabolism, used predict response targeting glucose metabolism. establish natural product, koningic acid (KA), selective inhibitor GAPDH, enzyme characterize differential control properties metabolism WE. machine learning integrated pharmacogenomics metabolomics, demonstrate KA efficacy determined status individual genes, quantitative extent WE, leading therapeutic window vivo. Thus, basis targeting encoded molecular principles extend beyond status individual genes.
