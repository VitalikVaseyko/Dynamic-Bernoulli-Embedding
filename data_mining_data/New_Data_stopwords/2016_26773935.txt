 long recognized cancer cells display increased glucose uptake metabolism. rate-limiting step glucose metabolism, glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins facilitate glucose uptake across plasma membrane. Fourteen members GLUT protein family identified humans. review describes major characteristics member GLUT family highlights evidence abnormal expression tumors cancer cells. regulation GLUTs key proliferation pro-survival pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), Ras, c-Myc p53 pathways discussed. clinical utility GLUT expression cancer recognized evidence regarding use GLUTs prognostic predictive biomarkers presented. GLUTs represent attractive targets cancer therapy review summarizes recent studies GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT5 others inhibited decrease cancer growth.
