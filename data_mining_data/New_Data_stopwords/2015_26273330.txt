 tumor cells show different metabolic pathways normal cells. Even conditions sufficient oxygen, produce energy high rate glycolysis followed lactic acid fermentation cytosol, known aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect. Lung cancer malignant tumor one highest incidence mortality rates world present. However, exact mechanisms underlying lung cancer development remain unclear. three key enzymes glycolysis hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase. Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes transfer pyruvate lactate. four enzymes reported overexpressed tumors, including lung cancer, regulated many oncoproteins promote tumor proliferation, migration, metastasis dependence independence glycolysis. discovery aerobic glycolysis 1920s provided new means potential therapeutic targets lung cancer.
