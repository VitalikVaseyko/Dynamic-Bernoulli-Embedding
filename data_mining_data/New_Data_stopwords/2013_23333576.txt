 Hepatic gluconeogenesis major contributor blood glucose diabetes mellitus. previous study indicated areca nut extract enriched catechin-based procyanidins oligomers polymers gave rise anti-inflammatory effects vitro vivo. surveyed molecular features areca nut procyanidins (ANPs) using quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) resulting mass spectrum accurately described ANP monomer hexadecamer. Furthermore, potential ANP terms blood glucose homeostasis explored using cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/dexamethasone stimulated primary mouse hepatocytes multiple low dose streptozocin (MLD-STZ) treated mice. primary hepatocytes, ANP dose-dependently inhibited gluconeogenesis reduced mRNA expression two gluconeogenic key enzymes, phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Intragastrically feeding 10mg/kg ANP 4weeks reduced levels fasting blood glucose, PEPCK G6Pase MLD-STZ mice. additional, level 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression showed trend towards restored ANP treated MLD-STZ-mice. study indicated ANP potential improve hyperglycemia regulating gluconeogenic related kinases MLD-STZ-mice.
