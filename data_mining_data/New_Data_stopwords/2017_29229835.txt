 Warburg effect, characterized increased glucose uptake lactate production, well-known universal across cancer cells proliferating cells. PKM2, splice isoform pyruvate kinase (PK) specifically expressed cells, serves major regulator metabolic reprogramming adjustable activity subjected numerous allosteric effectors posttranslational modifications. Here, identified posttranslational modification PKM2, O-GlcNAcylation, specifically targets Thr(405) Ser(406), residues region encoded alternatively spliced exon 10 cancer cells. show PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation up-regulated various types human tumor cells patient tumor tissues. modification destabilized active tetrameric PKM2, reduced PK activity, led nuclear translocation PKM2. also observed modification associated increased glucose consumption lactate production enhanced level lipid DNA synthesis, indicating O-GlcNAcylation promotes Warburg effect. vivo experiments showed blocking PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation attenuated tumor growth. Thus, demonstrate O-GlcNAcylation regulatory mechanism PKM2 cancer cells serves bridge PKM2 metabolic reprogramming typical Warburg effect.
