 Chemokines function migration circulating leukocytes regions inflammation, implicated chronic inflammatory conditions including mycobacterial infection. investigated whether Leukotactin-1 (Lkn-1), novel member CC-chemokines, involved immune response macrophages Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, MTB infection increased mRNA expression Lkn-1 dose-dependent manner. Lkn-1 induction peaked 12 h infection, declined gradually returned basal level 72 h. Secretion Lkn-1 elevated MTB infection. increase expression secretion Lkn-1 caused MTB reduced cells treated inhibitors phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) Akt. MTB-induced Akt phosphorylation blocked treatment PI3-K inhibitor PDK1 inhibitor, implying PI3-K, PDK1, Akt associated signaling pathway up-regulates Lkn-1 response MTB. results suggest Lkn-1 novel member group chemokines released macrophages infected MTB.
