 orphan receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NROB2) transcriptional repressor inhibits nuclear receptor signaling diverse metabolic pathways. Here, report SHP(-/-) mice exhibited hypoinsulinemia age, associated increased peripheral insulin sensitivity increased response isolated islets glucose stimulation, yet maintain normal levels blood glucose. Deficiency SHP function resulted up-regulation glucose transporter 4 mRNA glucose uptake muscles, overexpression SHP C2C12 cells inhibited basal peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator-1alpha-stimulated glucose transporter 4 expression glucose uptake. SHP(-/-) hepatocytes showed markedly decreased basal glucose production cultures, SHP(-/-) livers increased glycogen stores sensitive insulin inhibition glucose output, concomitant decreased expression PPARgamma1, fatty acid translocase, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenol/pyruvate carboxykinase, increased mRNAs glucokinase pyruvate kinase. white fat, SHP deficiency resulted up-regulation genes involved insulin sensitizing, including PPARgamma2 adiponectin. show that, transcriptional level, SHP directly represses adiponectin promoter activity PPARgamma/liver receptor homolog-1. results suggest increases insulin sensitivity multiple signaling pathways muscle, liver, fat, increase islet secretory function, represent complex mechanism whereby SHP deficiency leads improvement insulin sensitivity, secretion, diabetes.
