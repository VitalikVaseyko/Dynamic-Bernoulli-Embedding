 Alterations enzyme activities involved muscle energy metabolism muscle fiber type distribution investigated six subjects, ranging age 19-23 years, following short-term, high intensity exercise. Changes vastus lateralis muscle studied prior exercise approximately 24 h 2 consecutive days supramaximal cycling exercise (120% VO2 max) performed intermittently 1-min work 4-min rest fatigue 24 repetitions completed. results indicated changes (P greater 0.05) maximal vitro activities representative enzymes beta-oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HAD), citric acid cycle (succinic dehydrogenase, SDH), glucose phosphorylation (hexokinase, HK), glycogenolysis (total phosphorylase, PHOSPH), glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, PFK; pyruvate kinase, PK; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) spite large increase carbohydrate utilization glycolytic flux rate. addition, although change fiber type distribution found pre-exercise biopsy days, acute reduction (P less 0.05) type fiber distribution occurred exercise. concluded supramaximal exercise performed short-term basis alter enzymatic profile fiber type distribution measured 24 h following activity.
