 dynamics partial glycolytic reaction sequence converts glucose 6-phosphate triose phosphates described. study performed cell-free extracts baker's yeast harvested logarithmic stationary growth phases. experiments based flow-through reactor supplied desalted cell-free extract well glucose 6-phosphate, ATP phosphoenolpyruvate. reaction system quasi-irreversible reactions catalyzed 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase involved. substrate supplied continuously, stable stationary states observed. transient perturbations substrate supply, multiple stationary states appear. Cyclic transitions unique stable stationary states induced appropriate changes rate substrate supply. hysteretic cycle could demonstrated when, reverse transitions, parameter region multistability passed. presence (in resting yeast) absence (in growing yeast) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase significantly influence dynamic capabilities investigated reaction sequence. kinetic properties cell-free extracts fit mathematical models developed vitro systems reconstituted purified enzymes.
