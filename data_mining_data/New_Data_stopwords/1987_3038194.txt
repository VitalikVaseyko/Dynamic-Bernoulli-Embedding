 Caloric restriction reduces incidence progression broad spectrum neoplastic diseases, yet little known biochemical molecular mechanisms involved. Profiles enzyme activities importance cellular energy utilization examined 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced (DMBA) mammary adenocarcinomas rats fed ad libitum calorically restricted diets. diets provided equal nutrients except fewer carbohydrate-derived calories; graded caloric restriction 10, 20, 30 40%. specific activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase elevated varying degrees large palpable small, non-palpable tumors calorically restricted hosts compared activities tumors ad libitum-fed rats. Phosphofructokinase activity increased palpable tumors calorically restricted hosts markedly reduced non-palpable tumors. results suggest adaptive compensatory alterations tumor enzyme profiles response altered nutritional state host.
