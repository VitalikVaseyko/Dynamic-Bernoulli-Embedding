 cure non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Therapies lack efficacy and/or toxic, reflecting failure target disease abnormalities distinct processes vital normal cells. NSCLC PAH share reversible mitochondrial-metabolic abnormalities may offer selective therapeutic targets. following mutually reinforcing, mitochondrial abnormalities favor proliferation, impair apoptosis, relatively restricted PAH cancer cells: (1) Epigenetic silencing superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) methylation CpG islands creates pseudohypoxic redox environment causes normoxic activation hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha). (2) HIF-1alpha increases expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), impairs oxidative metabolism promotes glycolytic metabolic state. (3) Mitochondrial fragmentation, partially due mitofusin-2 downregulation, promotes proliferation. review focuses recent discovery decreased expression SOD2, putative tumor-suppressor gene major source H2O2, results hypermethylation CpG islands. cancer PAH hypermethylation site enhancer region intron 2 inhibits SOD2 transcription. normal PASMC, SOD2 siRNA decreases H2O2 activates HIF-1alpha. PAH, reduced SOD2 expression decreases H2O2, reduces cytosol thereby activates HIF-1alpha. causes glycolytic shift metabolism increases proliferation/apoptosis ratio downregulating Kv1.5 channels, increasing cytosolic calcium, inhibiting caspases. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, restores SOD2 expression, corrects proliferation/apoptosis imbalance PAH cancer cells. specificity PAH lung vessels may relate selective upregulation DNA methyltransferases mediate CpG methylation PASMC (DNA MT-1A -3B). SOD2 augmentation inactivates HIF-1alpha PAH PASMC therapy SOD mimetic, MnTBAP, regresses experimental PAH. conclusion, cancer PAH share acquired mitochondrial abnormalities increase proliferation inhibit apoptosis, suggesting new therapeutic targets.
