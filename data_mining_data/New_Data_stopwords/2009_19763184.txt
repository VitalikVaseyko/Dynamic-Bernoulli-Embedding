 Warburg effect describes cancer cells down-regulate aerobic respiration preferentially use glycolysis generate energy. evaluate link hypoxia Warburg effect, studied mitochondrial electron transport, angiogenesis glycolysis pheochromocytomas induced germ-line mutations VHL, RET, NF1 SDH genes. SDH VHL gene mutations shown lead activation hypoxic response, even normoxic conditions, process referred pseudohypoxia. observed decrease electron transport protein expression activity, associated increased angiogenesis SDH- VHL-related, pseudohypoxic tumors, stimulation glycolysis solely observed VHL tumors. Moreover, microarray analyses revealed expression genes involved metabolic pathways efficient tool classification pheochromocytomas accordance predisposition gene mutated. data suggest unexpected association pseudohypoxia loss p53, leads distinct Warburg effect VHL-related pheochromocytomas.
