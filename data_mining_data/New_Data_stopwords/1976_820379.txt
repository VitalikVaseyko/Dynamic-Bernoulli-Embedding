 pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) Streptococcus lactis C10 activated fructose 1,6-diphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), activity sigmoidal function activator concentration. FDP0.5V (Fru-1,6-P2 concentration giving half-maximal velocity) markedly increased presence low concentrations inorganic phosphate; 1 mM phosphate increases FDP0.5V value 6-fold. Although intracellular level Fru-1,6-P2 (12-18 mM) exponentially growing cells medium used much greater FDP0.5V pyruvate kinase (0.2 mM) determined triethanolamine-HCl buffer, much higher Fru-1,6-P2 concentration may required activate enzyme vivo overcome phosphate inhibition. Tris maleate also inhibit enzyme. low concentrations Fru-1,6-P2 (0.1 mM), reaction rate sigmoidal function phosphoenolpyruvate adenosine diphosphate (ADP) concentrations; near saturating concentrations activator (1 mM) response varying ADP hyperbolic response varying phosphoenolpyruvate becomes much less sigmoidal. affinity substrates (especially phosphoenolpyruvate) also increased increasing concentration Fru-1,6-P2. affinity enzyme guanosine disphosphate (GDP) 12-13 times ADP assay conditions used. Streptococcus lactis pyruvate kinase molecular weight 240000 subunit molecular weight 60000.
