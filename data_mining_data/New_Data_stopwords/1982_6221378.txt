 participation intracellular creatine kinase system energy transport cardiac cells studied further. functional behavior different kinetically indistinguishable isoenzymes creatine kinase (CK) muscle cells determined intracellular localization shown report mitochondrial sarcolemmal creatine kinases. kinetics forward mitochondrial creatine kinase reaction influenced oxidative phosphorylation increases apparent affinity ATP change kinetics reverse creatine kinase reaction. molar content creatine kinase heart mitochondria determined found close content adenine nucleotide translocase, thus supporting concept tight functional relationship two mitochondrial proteins basis effective phosphocreatine (PCr) production mitochondria. sarcolemmal preparation, antiport Na+ K+ much effectively supported sarcolemmal creatine kinase reaction externally added ATP-regenerating system consisting phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. results experiments taken show ability sarcolemmal creatine kinase maintain high phosphorylation potential vicinity active centers Na+ -K+ ATPase necessary support active transport Na+ K+ across plasma membrane avoid reversal ion gradient. Finally, concluded chapter rapid decrease PCr content cells anoxic ischemic conditions may one important factors impairment cardiac contractile function conditions.
