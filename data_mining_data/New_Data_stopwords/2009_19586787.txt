 cancers rely disproportionately glycolysis energy even presence adequate oxygen supply, condition known "aerobic glycolysis", Warburg effect. Pharmacological reversal Warburg effect shown cause selective apoptosis tumor cells, presumably stimulating mitochondrial respiratory chain activity production reactive oxygen species that, turn, induce caspase-mediated series reactions leading cell death. reasoned similar effect tumor cells might result up-regulation E1alpha subunit gene (pda1) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes rate-limiting step aerobic glucose oxidation thus plays major role control oxidative phosphorylation. test postulate, employed self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV)-based delivery expression system targeting pda1 mitochondria primary cultures human hepatoblastoma (HB) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Serotypes 1-10 scAAV vectors included enhanced green fluorescent (egfp) reporter gene driven either cytomegalovirus (CMV) chicken beta-actin (CBA) promoters analyzed transduction ability HB (Huh-6) HCC (Huh-7 HepG2) cell lines primary cultures normal human hepatocytes. Serotype 3 scAAV-egfp (scAAV3-egfp) vector efficient transduced 90% cells. limited transgene expression primarily liver cancer cells generating scAAV3 vectors contained human alpha-fetoprotein promoter (AFP)-driven reporter gene (scAAV3.AFP-egfp) potentially therapeutic gene scAAV3.AFP-pda1. Infection Huh-6 cells scAAV3.AFP-pda1 vector increased protein expression E1alpha, PDC catalytic activity, late-stage apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis also associated increased protein expression Bcl-X/S, early marker apoptosis, release cytochrome c cytosol infected HB cells. data indicate molecular targeting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism liver cancer cells AAV3-mediated delivery pda1 holds promise novel effective therapeutic approach human hepatic tumors.
