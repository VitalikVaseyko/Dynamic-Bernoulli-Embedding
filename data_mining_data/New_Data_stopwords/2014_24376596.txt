 BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Acyclic retinoid (ACR) promising chemopreventive agent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) selectively inhibits growth HCC cells (JHH7) normal hepatic cells (Hc). better understand molecular basis selective anti-cancer effect ACR, performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolome analyses JHH7 Hc cells treatment ACR. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: NMR-based metabolomics revealed distinct metabolomic profile JHH7 cells 18 h ACR treatment 4 h ACR treatment. CE-TOFMS analysis identified 88 principal metabolites JHH7 Hc cells 24 h treatment ethanol (EtOH) ACR. abundance 71 metabolites significantly different EtOH-treated control JHH7 Hc cells, 49 metabolites significantly down-regulated ACR-treated JHH7 cells compared EtOH-treated JHH7 cells. particular interest, increase adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), main cellular energy source, observed EtOH-treated control JHH7 cells almost completely suppressed ACR-treated JHH7 cells; treatment ACR restored ATP basal levels observed EtOH-control ACR-treated Hc cells (0.72-fold compared EtOH control-treated JHH7 cells). Moreover, real-time PCR analyses revealed ACR significantly increased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 4 (PDK4), key regulator ATP production, JHH7 cells Hc cells (3.06-fold 1.20-fold compared EtOH control, respectively). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: results present study suggest ACR may suppress enhanced energy metabolism JHH7 cells Hc cells; occurs least part via cancer-selective enhancement PDK4 expression. cancer-selective metabolic pathways identified study important targets anti-cancer activity ACR.
