 PURPOSE: investigated relationships biomarkers related anaerobic glycolytic metabolism (GLUT1, LDH5, PDK1, HIF-1alpha proteins), pathologic response, prognosis. METHODS: stage II stage III rectal cancer patients 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/day 28 fractions) 5.5 weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (425 mg/m(2)/day) leucovorin (20 mg/m(2)/day) bolus days 1 5 29 33, surgery performed 7 10 weeks completion therapies. Expression GLUT1, LDH5, PDK1, HIF-1alpha proteins determined immunohistochemistry assessed 104 patients rectal cancer treated neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: study included stage II III rectal cancer patients, stage accounted 50 % total cases. high expression GLUT1 protein associated significantly lower rate ypCR compared low expression GLUT1 protein (4.0 % vs. 27.8 %, respectively; p = 0.012). GLUT1 expression also significantly higher poor response group (Grade 0, 1) good response group (Grade 2, 3) (34.0 % vs. 14.8 %, respectively; p = 0.022). recurrence analysis, expression GLUT1 protein demonstrated significant correlation time recurrence, based log-rank method (p = 0.016). analyzed multiple Cox regression, positive expression GLUT1 significant independent unfavorable prognostic factor (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: GLUT1 expression predictive prognostic factor pathologic complete response recurrence rectal cancer patients treated 5-flurouracil leucovorin neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
