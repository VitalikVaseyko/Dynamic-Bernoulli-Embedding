 OBJECTIVE: SLC3 Friend erythroleukemic cell line established Pk-1(slc) mouse, mouse model red blood cell type-pyruvate kinase (R-PK) deficiency. study aimed elucidate mechanisms attributing apoptosis induced R-PK deficiency. MATERIALS METHODS: SLC3 control Friend cell line, CBA2, cultured condition glucose deprivation supplementation 2-deoxyglucose, apoptosis detected annexin V. established two stable transfectants SLC3 cells human R-PK cDNA, examined effect R-PK apoptotic feature cell cycle analysis. Intracellular oxidation measured 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. DNA microarray analysis performed examine gene-expression profiles two transfectants parental SLC3. RESULTS: SLC3 susceptible CBA2 apoptosis induced glycolytic inhibition. forced expression R-PK significantly decreased cells sub G0/G1 stage expression-level dependent manner. Microarray analysis showed proapoptotic genes, Bad, Bnip3, Bnip3l, downregulated transfectants. addition, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) antioxidant genes, Cat, Txnrd1, Glrx1 also downregulated. significant decrease dichlorofluorescein fluorescence observed R-PK expression. Preincubation glutathione precursor showed significant decrease apoptosis. CONCLUSION: results indicated glycolytic inhibition R-PK gene mutation augmented oxidative stress Friend erythroleukemia cell, leading activation hypoxia-inducible factor-1 well downstream proapoptotic gene expression. Thus, R-PK plays important role antioxidant erythroid differentiation.
