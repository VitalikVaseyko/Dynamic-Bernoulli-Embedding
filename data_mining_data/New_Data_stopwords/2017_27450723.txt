 Therapeutic targeting ASCT2, glutamine transporter plays major role glutamine uptake cancer cells, challenging ASCT2 also biological role normal tissues. study, report novel finding ASCT2 physically associated molecular complex epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), often overexpressed human head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Furthermore, found ASCT2 co-targeted cetuximab, EGFR antibody approved treating metastatic HNSCC. demonstrated cetuximab downregulated ASCT2 EGFR expression-dependent manner via cetuximab-mediated EGFR endocytosis. Downregulation ASCT2 cetuximab led decreased intracellular uptake glutamine subsequently decreased glutathione level. Cetuximab thereby sensitized HNSCC cells reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis and, importantly, independent effective inhibition EGFR downstream signaling cetuximab. contrast, knockdown EGFR siRNA inhibition EGFR kinase gefitinib, EGFR kinase inhibitor, failed sensitize HNSCC cells ROS-induced apoptosis. findings support novel therapeutic strategy EGFR-overexpressing cetuximab-resistant cancers combining cetuximab oxidative therapy.
