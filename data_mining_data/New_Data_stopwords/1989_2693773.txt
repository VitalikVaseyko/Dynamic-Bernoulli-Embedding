 Since discovery glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency pyruvate kinase deficiency, erythroenzymopathies associated hereditary hemolytic anemia extensively investigated. Kinetic electrophoretic studies shown erythroenzymopathies caused production mutant enzyme. Single amino acid substitutions determined G6PD phosphoglycerate kinase variants studies enzyme. Except two enzymes, difficult purify characterize patient's enzyme low protein contents red blood cells. Recent advance recombinant DNA technology made possible isolation normal genomic DNA cDNA several enzymes. results permit us study molecular basis erythroenzymopathies nucleotide level. Single base substitutions identified aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, G6PD adenylate kinase variants cloning nucleotide sequence patients' genes. date, enzyme-deficient variants investigated caused point mutations. exception hemolytic anemia secondary increased adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity. Red cell ADA activity increases order hundred-fold affected individuals. basic abnormality appears result overproduction structurally normal enzyme due abnormal translational efficiency.
