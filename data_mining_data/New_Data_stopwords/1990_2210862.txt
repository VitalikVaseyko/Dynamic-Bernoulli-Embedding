 human granulocyte easy obtain shows nearly complete enzymatic equipment. therefore represents interesting model in-vitro studies metabolic disorders various clinical conditions. presented study, activities several enzymes glycolysis citric cycle measured granulocytes separated surgical patients (n = 10). Blood samples 20 40 ml drawn 6.5 +/- 4.8 hours termination surgical procedure. patients artificially respirated nourished intravenously according results indirect calorimetry. Hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) measured photometrically cell homogenate. values compared determined group healthy, not-anesthetized persons, nourished studied identically (n = 12). granulocytes separated patients following major surgery found increased activities HK (29.8 vs. 24.1 mU/mg protein controls), LDH (2,484 vs. 1,868 mU/mg protein, p less 0.01) IDH (41.5 vs. 35 mU/mg protein, p less 0.05), reduced activity PK (1,623 vs. 2,265 mU/mg protein, p less 0.01). Assuming alterations enzyme activities isolated granulocytes reflect metabolic alterations whole organism certain extent, results interpreted decreased induction PK insulin, increase lactate recycling via Cori cycle (LDH), stimulated substrate flux citric cycle (IDH). separated human granulocyte recommended model posttraumatic metabolic disorders. taken consideration studies leading improvement nutrition posttraumatic glucose mal-utilization.
