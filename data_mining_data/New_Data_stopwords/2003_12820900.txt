 forkhead-type transcription factor, DAF-16, located downstream part insulin signalling pathway via PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase). essential extension life-span also involved dauer formation induced food deprivation Caenorhabditis elegans. present study, addressed whether FOXO members AFX, FKHR (forkhead homologue rhabdomyosarcoma) FKHRL1 (FKHR-like protein 1), mammalian counterparts DAF-16, involved starvation stress. found remarkable selective induction FKHR FKHRL1 transcripts skeletal muscle mice starvation. induction FKHR gene expression observed 6 h food deprivation, peaked 12 h, returned basal level 24 h refeeding. induction also found skeletal muscle mice glucocorticoid treatment. Moreover, found levels PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) gene expression up-regulated direct binding FKHR promoter region gene C2C12 cells. results suggest FKHR important role regulation energy metabolism, least part, up-regulation PDK4 gene expression skeletal muscle starvation.
