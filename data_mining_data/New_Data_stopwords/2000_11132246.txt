 changes vascular prostaglandin production implicated derangement vascular reactivity diabetes. However, mechanism altered prostaglandin (PG) production diabetes largely unknown. study, investigated effect high glucose IL-1beta-induced PG production possible underlying mechanism cultured vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC). High glucose evoked augmentation IL-1beta-induced PG synthesis dose dependent manner enhanced cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, reached maximum 8-12 hours stimulation. Western blot analysis supported activity data. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, H-7 chelerythrine, significantly inhibited enhancement IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression high glucose. activation PKC PMA resulted marked increase PG production low glucose group, whilst case high glucose group. Furthermore, glucose-enhancing effect significantly suppressed zopolrestat, aldose reductase inhibitor, sodium pyruvate. results suggest augmenting effect high glucose IL-1beta-induced PG production COX-2 expression is, least part, due increased glucose metabolism via sorbitol pathway following PKC activation.
