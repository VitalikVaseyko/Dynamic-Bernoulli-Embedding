 Heparin, shown behave effective specific inhibitor type II casein kinases, exhibits stimulatory effect phosphorylation rate pyruvate kinase phosphorylase kinase, histones, catalytic subunit cAMP-dependent protein kinase. pyruvate kinase substrate phosphorylation rate approximately doubled heparin concentrations around 100 micrograms/ml, 2 4 micrograms heparin per ml sufficient induce half maximal effect. stimulation heparin observed replacing protein substrates two synthetic peptides reproducing phosphorylatable sites pyruvate kinase gamma subunit phosphorylase kinase. data support hypothesis heparin accelerates phosphorylation rendering phosphorylatable sites readily accessible protein kinase.
