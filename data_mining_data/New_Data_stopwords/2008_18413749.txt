 Cancer cells acquire drug resistance result selection pressure dictated unfavorable microenvironments. survival process facilitated efficient control oxidative stress originating mitochondria typically initiates programmed cell death. show critical adaptive response cancer cells linked uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), mitochondrial suppressor reactive oxygen species (ROS). UCP2 present drug-resistant lines various cancer cells human colon cancer. Overexpression UCP2 HCT116 human colon cancer cells inhibits ROS accumulation apoptosis exposure chemotherapeutic agents. Tumor xenografts UCP2-overexpressing HCT116 cells retain growth nude mice receiving chemotherapy. Augmented cancer cell survival accompanied altered NH(2)-terminal phosphorylation pivotal tumor suppressor p53 induction glycolytic phenotype (Warburg effect). findings link UCP2 molecular mechanisms chemoresistance. Targeting UCP2 may considered novel treatment strategy cancer.
