 Clostridium thermocellum produces ethanol one major end products direct fermentation cellulosic biomass. Therefore, viewed attractive model production biofuels via consolidated bioprocessing. However, better understanding metabolic pathways, along putative regulation, could lead improved strategies increasing production ethanol. absence annotated pyruvate kinase genome, alternate means generating pyruvate sought. Previous proteomic transcriptomic work detected high levels malate dehydrogenase malic enzyme, may used part malate shunt generation pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate. purification characterization malate dehydrogenase malic enzyme described order elucidate putative roles malate shunt potential role C. thermocellum metabolism. malate dehydrogenase catalyzed reduction oxaloacetate malate utilizing NADH NADPH kcat 45.8 s(-1) 14.9 s(-1), respectively, resulting 12-fold increase catalytic efficiency using NADH NADPH. malic enzyme displayed reversible malate decarboxylation activity kcat 520.8 s(-1). malic enzyme used NADP(+) cofactor along NH4 (+) Mn(2+) activators. Pyrophosphate found potent inhibitor malic enzyme activity, Ki 0.036 mM. propose putative regulatory mechanism malate shunt pyrophosphate NH4 (+) based characterization malate dehydrogenase malic enzyme.
