 Ethanol widely used drug consumed large amounts pharmacologic effects. Elimination ethanol alters metabolism liver throughout organism. Ethanol's effect metabolites influence regulation key pathways gluconeogenesis. adopted proton NMR-based metabolomic approach study ethanol-induced metabolic changes liver, blood, brain tissue rats exposed either single dose ethanol chronic 4 day binge-ethanol protocol. acute binge ethanol caused (i) decreased glucose, lactate, alanine liver serum; (ii) increased acetate liver serum; (iii) increased acetoacetate serum. Binge-ethanol increased liver beta-hydroxybutyrate decreased betaine. Pretreatment antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) increased betaine reduced ethyl glucuronide (EtG) livers binge-ethanol animals, compared pretreated BHT. found change brain metabolites single dose ethanol. Unsupervised principal component (PC) analysis spectral data liver serum successfully discriminated treatment groups, based largely biochemical differences outlined above, confirming results manual analysis. explain observed lack gluconeogenesis following ethanol treatment resolve apparently discordant results previous studies, propose model decreased hepatic alanine removes inhibition pyruvate kinase, thus permitting futile cycle diverts phosphoenolpyruvate away gluconeogenesis. new mechanism biochemically elucidates well-known, yet unexplained, "empty calorie" phenomenon ethanol. Reduction EtG pretreatment BHT suggests BHT perhaps compounds may alter pharmacokinetics EtG EtG may always sensitive marker ethanol abuse.
