 Hundreds small RNAs (sRNAs) identified diverse bacterial species, functions remain unknown, regulate key processes, particularly stress responses. sRNA DicF identified 25 years ago inhibitor cell division since remained uncharacterized. DicF consists 53 nucleotides encoded gene carried prophage (Qin) genomes many Escherichia coli strains. demonstrated DicF inhibits cell division via direct base pairing ftsZ mRNA repress translation prevent new synthesis bacterial tubulin homolog FtsZ. Systems analysis using computational experimental methods identified additional mRNA targets DicF: xylR pykA mRNAs, encoding xylose uptake catabolism regulator pyruvate kinase, respectively. Genetic analyses showed DicF directly base pairs represses translation targets. Phenotypes cells expressing DicF variants demonstrated DicF-associated growth inhibition solely due repression ftsZ, indicating physiological consequences DicF-mediated regulation extend beyond effects cell division caused reduced FtsZ synthesis. IMPORTANCE sRNAs ubiquitous versatile regulators bacterial gene expression. number well-characterized examples E. coli highly conserved present E. coli core genome. contrast, sRNA DicF (identified 20 years ago remaining poorly characterized) encoded gene carried defective prophage element many E. coli genomes. Here, characterize DicF order better understand horizontally acquired sRNA regulators impact bacterial gene expression physiology. data confirm long-hypothesized DicF-mediated regulation ftsZ, encoding bacterial tubulin homolog required cell division. uncover DicF-mediated posttranscriptional control metabolic gene expression. Ectopic production DicF highly toxic E. coli cells, toxicity attributable DicF regulation ftsZ. work needed reveal biological roles benefits host conferred DicF products encoded defective prophages.
