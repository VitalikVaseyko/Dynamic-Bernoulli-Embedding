 Malignancy cancer associated aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) evidenced increased trapping [(18)F]deoxyglucose (FdG) patients imaged positron emission tomography (PET). [(18)F]deoxyglucose uptake correlates glucose transporter (GLUT-1) expression, regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha). previously reported established breast lines HIF-1alpha levels presence oxygen leads Warburg effect. However, glycolysis GLUT-1 also induced independent HIF-1alpha factors, c-Myc phosphorylated Akt (pAkt). study investigates HIF-1alpha, c-Myc, pAkt, aerobic glycolysis low-passage breast cancer cells assumption represent vivo condition better established lines. Similar vivo FdG-PET primary breast cancers, rates glycolysis diverse, higher cells expressing c-Myc HIF-1alpha lower cell lines low negative transcription factors. correlations observed glycolytic rates pAkt levels. Two 12 cell lines formed xenografts mice. positive HIF-1alpha phosphorylated c-Myc, one positive pAkt. Glycolysis affected pharmacological regulation c-Myc HIF-1alpha. findings suggest c-Myc and/or HIF-1alpha activities involved regulation glycolysis breast cancers.
