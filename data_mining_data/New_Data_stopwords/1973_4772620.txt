 Intact rats trained controlled feeding lighting schedule designated ;8+16' exhibited diurnal oscillations liver weight, glucokinase activity liver glycogen content. Glucokinase activity expressed units/g liver decreased 30% unoperated controls first 48h partial hepatectomy returned near normal values 2 weeks. glucokinase activity expressed units/liver per 100g body wt., decrease 50% control activity observed 24 48h operation. similar pattern found pyruvate kinase type I. contrast, pyruvate kinase type III activity increased partial hepatectomy. suggested newly divided cells partial hepatectomy synthesize glucokinase pyruvate kinase synthesize pyruvate kinase III. Glycogen found accumulate early 24h partial hepatectomy, normal concentrations reached 48h operation performed times feeding periods.
