 Macrophages believed play crucial role atherogenesis atherosclerotic plaque progression, mainly role accumulation large amounts cholesteryl ester foam cell formation uptake arterial intima oxidized LDL (oxLDL) particles known proatherogenic. aim study use differential proteomic approach identify response human monocyte-derived macrophages treatment oxLDL 24 h. Mass spectrometry analysis (MALDI-TOF) 2D-DIGE gels made possible identify 9 intracellular 3 secreted proteins up-regulated, 11 intracellular 1 secreted proteins down-regulated, 2 secreted proteins induced. methodological approach confirmed differential expression levels proteins known regulated oxLDL macrophages, catalase pyruvate kinase, also identified oxLDL modulation proteins first time, including heat shock proteins (HSP) Actin cytoskeletal proteins. Semiquantitative Western blot confirmed role. HSPs identified included heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hsc70), 75 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP75), heat shock 70 kDa protein (Hsp70), 60 kDa (Hsp60) proteins. highly conserved intracellular protein chaperones, commonly seen atherosclerotic plaques, appear participate protection cellular stress. Interestingly, oxLDL also modulated several F-Actin capping proteins involved Actin polymerization motility: gelsolin, CapG, CapZ. conclusion, demonstrated effects oxLDL modulation several proteins human macrophages established functional profile human macrophage atherosclerotic process.
