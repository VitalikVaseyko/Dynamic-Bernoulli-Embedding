 kinetic optical properties Co(II)-substituted pyruvate kinase presence D-phenylalanine (D-Phe) investigated. results discussed comparison effects optical isomer L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) enzyme. catalytic effect D-Phe rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase depended upon nature activating divalent metal ion used. stimulatory effect Mg(II)-activated enzyme, inhibitory effect Co(II)-activated enzyme. Unlike inhibitory effect L-Phe, inhibition Co(II)-enzyme D-Phe sensitive changes pH temperature, could reversed L-alanine (L-Ala), displayed hyperbolic kinetics, noncompetitive respect phosphoenopyruvate saturation. D-Phe induced substantial visible circular dichroism (CD) spectral changes Co(II)-enzyme similar induced L-Phe. Although ultraviolet CD spectrum affected, D-Phe induced ultraviolet difference absorption spectral change similar to, much smaller than, induced L-Phe. results support D-Phe amino acids interact enzyme two different sites: common site, causing similar conformational changes bear little direct kinetic relevance, kinetically relevant site, sterically dependent upon side chain amino acids.
