 ability guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMP=P(NH)P) guanylylmethylenediphosphonate (GMP-P(CH2)P) activate adenylate cyclase activity studied incubating analogs fat cell membranes followed thorough washing membranes assay enzyme activity. GMP-P(NH)P hydrolyzed membrane preparations several tissues. pyruvate kinase regenerating system maintains concentration GMP-P(NH)P thereby augments ability suboptimal concentrations GMP-P(NH)P activate adenylate cyclase. GTP inhibits activation fat cell membrane adenylate cyclase GMP-P(NH)P inhibition overcome time. consistent virtually irreversible nature GMP-P(NH)P activation, inability GTP reverse stimulated state enzyme. Although initial rate enzyme activation highly dependent concentration GMP-P(NH)P, increasing times incubation nearly maximal extent activation seen wide range concentrations. Thus, possible estimate true affinity constants (at equilibrium) GMP-P(NH)P, anticipated virtually irreversible character activation process.
