 recently proposed new model cancer metabolism explain role aerobic glycolysis L-lactate production fueling tumor growth metastasis. model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress aerobic glycolysis tumor stroma. This, turn, drives L-lactate secretion cancer-associated fibroblasts. Secreted L-lactate fuels oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) epithelial cancer cells, acting paracrine onco-metabolite. previously termed type two-compartment tumor metabolism "Reverse Warburg Effect," aerobic glycolysis takes place stromal fibroblasts, rather epithelial cancer cells. Here, used MCT4 immuno-staining human breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs; > 180 triple-negative patients) directly assess prognostic value "Reverse Warburg Effect." MCT4 expression functional marker hypoxia, oxidative stress, aerobic glycolysis, L-lactate efflux. Remarkably, high stromal MCT4 levels (score = 2) specifically associated decreased overall survival (< 18% survival 10 post-diagnosis). contrast, patients absent stromal MCT4 expression (score = 0), 10-y survival rates ~97% (p-value < 10 (-32) ). High stromal levels MCT4 strictly correlated loss stromal Cav-1 (p-value < 10 (-14) ), known marker early tumor recurrence metastasis. fact, combined use stromal Cav-1 stromal MCT4 allowed us precisely identify high-risk triple-negative breast cancer patients, consistent goal individualized risk-assessment personalized cancer treatment. However, epithelial MCT4 staining prognostic value, indicating "conventional" Warburg effect predict clinical outcome. Thus, "Reverse Warburg Effect" "parasitic" energy-transfer key determinant poor overall patient survival. MCT4 druggable-target, MCT4 inhibitors developed treatment aggressive breast cancers, possibly types human cancers. Similarly, discuss stromal MCT4 could used biomarker identifying high-risk cancer patients could likely benefit treatment FDA-approved drugs existing MCT-inhibitors (such as, AR-C155858, AR-C117977, AZD-3965).
