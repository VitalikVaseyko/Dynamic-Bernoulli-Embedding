 neuroprotective activity pyruvate confirmed previous vivo vitro studies. Here, report novel mechanism pyruvate prevents SH-SY5Y cells glutamate excitotoxicity regulating death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) protein complex. results showed pyruvate regulated DAPK1 protein complex protect cells two ways. First, pyruvate induced dissociation DAPK1 NMDA receptors. disruption DAPK1-NMDA receptors complex resulted decrease NMDA receptors phosphorylation. glutamate-stimulated Ca2+ influx inhibited intracellular Ca2+ overload alleviated, blocked release cytochrome c cell death. addition, increased Bcl-xL induced pyruvate regulated Bax/Bak dependent death inhibiting release cytochrome c mitochondrial inter-membrane space cytosol. result, cytochrome c-initiated caspase cascade, including caspase-3 caspase-9, inhibited. Second, pyruvate promoted association DAPK1 Beclin-1, resulted autophagy activation. autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine reversed protection afforded pyruvate. Furthermore, attenuation mitochondrial damage induced pyruvate partly reduced 3-methyladenine. suggested autophagy mediated pyruvate protection preventing mitochondrial damage. Taken together, pyruvate protects cells glutamate excitotoxicity regulating DAPK1 complexes, dissociation DAPK1 NMDA receptors association DAPK1 Beclin-1. go forward protect cells attenuating Ca2+ overload activating autophagy. Finally, convergence two ways protects mitochondria glutamate excitotoxicity, leads cell survival.
