 Reduced carbohydrate (CHO) availability exercise potent influence regulation substrate metabolism, little known impact fat availability and/or energy deficit fuel metabolism dietary CHO availability reduced. purpose study determine influence postexercise energy deficit, independent CHO availability, plasma substrate concentrations substrate oxidation. Seven moderately trained men (peak oxygen uptake: 56 +/- 2 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)) performed exhaustive cycling exercise two separate occasions. two trials differed meals ingested exercise: 1) high-fat diet designed maintain energy balance 2) low-fat diet designed elicit energy deficit. CHO protein contents diets identical. next morning, measured plasma substrate insulin concentrations CHO oxidation, obtained muscle biopsies vastus lateralis measurement pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-2 PDK-4 mRNA expression using RT-PCR. Despite identical blood glucose (5.0 +/- 0.1 4.9 +/- 0.1 mM) insulin (7.9 +/- 1.1 8.4 +/- 0.9 microU/ml) concentrations, plasma fatty acid glycerol concentrations elevated three- fourfold energy deficit compared energy balance CHO oxidation 40% lower (P < 0.01) morning energy deficit compared energy balance (328 +/- 69 565 +/- 89 micromol/min). lower CHO oxidation accompanied 7.3 +/- 2.5-fold increase PDK-4 mRNA expression energy deficit (P < 0.05), whereas PDK-2 mRNA similar trials. conclusion, energy deficit increases fatty acid availability, increases PDK-4 mRNA expression, suppresses CHO oxidation even dietary CHO content reduced.
