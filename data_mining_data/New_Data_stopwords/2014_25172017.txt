 Lactate, by-product glycolysis, indicator poor tissue perfusion useful biomarker prognostic value risk-stratifying patients several diseases. Furthermore, elevated lactate production observed tumour glycolysis, also known Warburg effect, essential promoting tumour cell invasion, metastasis, immune system evasion, promoting resistance cell death. However, studies elevated serum lactate brain tumour patients potential biomarker, knowledge. aim study determine possible correlations malignancy tumours pre- intraoperative serum lactate elevation patients undergoing craniotomy tumour resection. provide initial evidence rise serum lactate used non-invasive biomarker correlates brain tumour grade. results study future prospective studies may allow determination tumour progression response therapy using serum lactate biomarker.
