 Lysine 221 pyruvate kinase Bacillus stearothermophilus mutated arginine, leucine, asparatic acid cysteine. mutated enzymes 10(4) 10(5) times less active wild-type enzyme. cysteine-free enzyme C9S/C268S, enzyme C9S/C268S/K221C, possessed unique sulfhydryl group position 221, prepared. former comparable activity wild-type enzyme latter 10(4) times less active. enzymes denatured renatured aminoethylation. C9S/C268S/K221C enzyme failed regain activity renatured without aminoethylation; renatured aminoethylation, regained 4.5% activity C9S/C268S enzyme. evidence suggests importance Lys221 pyruvate kinase activity. kinetic parameters S-aminoethylated C9S/C268S/K221C enzyme suggest decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate.
