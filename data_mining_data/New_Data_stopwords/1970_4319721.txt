 enzyme responsible direct phosphorylation pyruvate gluconeogenesis Acetobacter xylinum purified 46-fold ultrasonic extracts freed interfering enzyme activities. enzyme shown catalyze reversible Mg(2+) ion-dependent conversion equimolar amounts pyruvate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), orthophosphate (P(i)) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), pyrophosphate (PP). optimal pH PEP synthesis pH 8.2; reversal pH 6.5. ratio initial rates reaction forward reverse directions 5.1 pH 8.2 0.45 pH 6.5. apparent K(m) values components system forward reaction were: pyruvate, 0.2 mm; ATP, 0.4 mm; P(i), 0.8 mm; Mg(2+), 2.2 mm; reverse reaction: PEP, 0.1 mm; AMP, 1.6 mum; PP, 0.067 mm; Mg(2+), 0.87 mm. PEP formation inhibited AMP PP. inhibition AMP competitive regard ATP (K(i) = 0.2 mm). reverse reaction inhibited competitively ATP noncompetitively pyruvate. enzyme strongly inhibited p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. inhibition reversed dithiothreitol glutathione. properties enzyme discussed relation regulation opposing enzymatic activities involved interconversion PEP pyruvate A. xylinum.
