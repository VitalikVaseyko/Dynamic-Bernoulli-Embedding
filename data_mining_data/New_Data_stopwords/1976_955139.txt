 Luteal metabolism investigated corpora lutea early pregnant rats treated four abortifacient agents. corpora lutea rats treated prostaglandin F2alpha rats 1 day postpartum, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity increased 140 170% 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20alpha-HSD) activated significantly high levels, whereas malic enzyme activity decreased 29% control values. aminoglutethimide-treated rats, activities G6PDH malic enzyme decreased, 20alpha-HSD activity maintained low level. increased dose, complete abortion observed. corpora lutea aborted rats, 20alpha-HSD activated moderately G6PDH values slightly higher control values, whereas malic enzyme activity fell lower levels. rats treated clomiphene citrate aborted within 63 hours last injection. activities G6PDH, malic enzyme, ATP citrate lyase corpora lutea decreased 66, 68, 72% control levels, respectively; 20alpha-HSD activity maintained low level, activities 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase appreciably altered. findings indicated that, beginning luteolysis fetal resorption, activities steroidogenic enzymes decreased 20alpha-HSD yet activated. Therefore, could gauge early changes luteolysis measuring activities G6PDH, MALIC ENZYME, ATP citrate lyase well 20alpha-HSD.
