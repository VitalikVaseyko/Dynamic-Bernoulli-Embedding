 BACKGROUND: Management diabetes without side effects still challenge medical system. leads increasing demand natural products antidiabetic activity fewer side effects. Grewia hirsuta (Tiliaceae) traditional herbal medicinal plant reported possess variety pharmacological actions. present research, compound (4Z, 12Z)-cyclopentadeca-4, 12-dienone isolated Grewia hirsuta taken ligand molecular docking studies. Evaluation hypoglycemic activity extensive silico docking approach molecular targets aldose reductase, glucokinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, glycogen synthase kinase-3, 11beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase performed. METHODS: Isolation (4Z, 12Z)-cyclopentadeca-4,12-dienone methanol extract leaves Grewia hirsuta performed column chromatography yield different fractions. fractions subjected purification structure elucidated confirmed spectroscopic methods including UV, FTIR, (1)H, (13)C NMR accurate mass determination carried using Q-TOF mass spectrometer. In-vivo experimentation performed evaluation alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase MTT assay reported author earlier paper. Molecular docking study performed GLIDE docking software. RESULTS: docking studies ligand (4Z, 12Z)-cyclopentadeca-4, 12-dienone seven different target proteins showed good inhibitor, docks well various targets related diabetes mellitus. Hence (4Z, 12Z)-cyclopentadeca-4,12-dienone considered developing potent anti-diabetic drug. CONCLUSION: results current study revealed leaves selected plant Grewia hirsuta contains potential inhibitor diabetes (4Z, 12Z)-cyclopentadeca-4,12-dienone. Thus enabling possibility plant extract new alternative existing diabetic approaches.
