 self-stabilization energy charge ATP investigated open reconstituted enzyme system containing phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. experiments performed stirred flow-through reactor containing gel-entrapped enzymes. dynamics system analyzed theoretically model based kinetic properties individual enzymes. energy charge identified one essential variables system. According theoretical prediction, homoeostasis energy charge observed experimentally either maximal activity phosphofructokinase, energy charge influx solution flow rate reaction chamber varied. shown efficiency stabilization energy charge related occurrence alternative stationary states.
