 Besides role carboxylase prosthetic group, biotin regulates gene expression wide repertoire effects systemic processes. Several studies shown pharmacological concentrations biotin reduce hypertriglyceridemia. molecular mechanisms pharmacological concentrations biotin affect lipid metabolism largely unknown. present study analyzed effects pharmacological doses biotin triglyceridemia, insulin sensitivity mRNA expression various lipogenic genes. Three-week-old male BALB/cAnN Hsd mice fed biotin-control biotin-supplemented diet (1.76 97.7mg free biotin/kg diet, respectively) period eight weeks. Serum triglyceride concentrations, insulin glucose tolerance mRNA abundance various lipogenic genes investigated. biotin-supplemented group showed 35% less serum triglycerides control mice. liver, found significant (P<0.05) reduction mRNA levels SREBP1-c, glucose transporter-2, phosphofructokinase-1, pyruvate kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase fatty acid synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase expression increased. changes glucokinase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, FoxO1 PPAR-gamma expression observed. adipose tissue, found decreased expression SREBP1c, glucose-6-phosphate deshydrogenase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, phosphofructokinase-1 PPAR-gamma, changes FoxO1 expression. Moreover, group fed biotin-supplemented diet showed significant decrease adipose tissue weight. differences insulin sensitivity serum insulin concentrations observed groups. results indicate pharmacological concentrations biotin decrease serum tryglyceride concentrations lipogenic gene expression liver adipose tissues.
