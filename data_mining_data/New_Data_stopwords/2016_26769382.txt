 FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21), first described main fasting-responsive molecule liver, shown act true metabolic regulator additional tissues, including muscle adipose tissues. present study, found expression secretion FGF21 rapidly increased following lactate exposure adipocytes. Using different pharmacological knockout mice models, demonstrated lactate regulates Fgf21 expression NADH/NAD-independent pathway, requires active p38-MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) signalling. also demonstrated effect restricted lactate additional metabolites including pyruvate ketone bodies also activated FGF21 stress response. FGF21 release adipose cells response excess intermediate metabolites may represent physiological mechanism sensing environmental metabolic conditions results release FGF21 improve metabolic adaptations.
