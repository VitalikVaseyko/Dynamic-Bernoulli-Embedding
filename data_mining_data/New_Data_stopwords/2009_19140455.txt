 influence chronic consumption alcohol biochemical reactions thiamine metabolism rat brain investigated. shown content thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) brain tissue change conditions, though essential decrease thiamine-kinase activity. ability isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) absorb labelled thiamine also decreases condition. specified disturbances probably reason deceleration exchange free (uncombined proteins) thiamine phosphates nervous cells, results observed reduction activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) due inactivation phosphorylation. Thiamine-binding thiaminetriphosphatase activities thiamine-binding protein (ThBP) structure synaptic plasma membranes (SPM), isolated rat brain various experimental groups, investigated. increase, respect control, enzymes activity SPM, isolated brain rats chronic alcoholism shown. Kinetic researches testify increase affinity SPM (ThBP) thiamine thiaminetriphosphate conditions. vitamin E given animals model chronic alcoholism normalization PDC activity nervous cells observed, testify transient character changes. Inability vitamin E normalize biological activities ThBP PMS, analyzed, testify deep disturbances structure SPM thiamine binding protein structure.
