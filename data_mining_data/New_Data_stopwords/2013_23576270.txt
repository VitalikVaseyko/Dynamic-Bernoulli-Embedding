 O-GlcNAcylation dynamic PTM nuclear cytoplasmic proteins, regulated O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) O-GlcNAcase, catalyze addition removal O-GlcNAc, respectively. modification associated glucose metabolism, plays important roles many diseases including cancer. Although emerging evidence reveals tumor-associated proteins O-GlcNAc modified, total O-GlcNAcylation cancer still largely unexplored. Here, demonstrate O-GlcNAcylation increased primary breast malignant tumors, benign tumors augmentation associated increased expression OGT level. Using 2D O-GlcNAc immnoblotting LC-MS/MS analysis, successfully identified 29 proteins, seven uniquely O-GlcNAcylated associated O-GlcNAcylation cancer. identified proteins, related Warburg effect, including metabolic enzymes, proteins involved stress responses biosynthesis. addition, proteins associated RNA metabolism, gene expression, cytoskeleton highly O-GlcNAcylated associated O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, OGT knockdown showed decreasing O-GlcNAcylation related inhibition anchorage-independent growth vitro. data indicate aberrant protein O-GlcNAcylation associated breast cancer. Abnormal modification O-GlcNAc-modified proteins might one vital malignant characteristics cancer.
