 Sarcosine N-methyl derivative amino acid glycine, elevation tissues physiological fluids patients sarcosinemia could reflect deficient pool size activated 1-carbon units. Sarcosinemia rare inherited metabolic condition associated mental retardation. present study, investigated acute effect sarcosine and/or creatine plus pyruvate parameters oxidative stress energy metabolism cerebral cortex homogenates 21-day-old Wistar rats. Acute administration sarcosine induced oxidative stress diminished activities adenylate kinase, GAPDH, complex IV, mitochondrial cytosolic creatine kinase. hand, succinate dehydrogenase activity enhanced cerebral cortex rats. Moreover, total sulfhydryl content significantly diminished, DCFH oxidation, TBARS content, activities SOD GPx significantly enhanced acute administration sarcosine. Co-administration creatine plus pyruvate effective prevention alterations provoked sarcosine administration oxidative stress enzymes phosphoryltransfer network. results indicate acute administration sarcosine may stimulate oxidative stress alter energy metabolism cerebral cortex rats. case effects also occur humans, may contribute, along mechanisms, neurological dysfunction sarcosinemia, creatine pyruvate supplementation could beneficial patients.
