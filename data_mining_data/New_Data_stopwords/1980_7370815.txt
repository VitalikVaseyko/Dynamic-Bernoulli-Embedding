 interactions L-Phe L-Ala rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase dependend upon nature divalent metal ions sutdied: Mg(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Ni(II). L-phe inhibited metal derivatives enzyme except Mn(II)--enzyme. L-Ala inhibited Ni(II)--enzyme effect metal derivatives. inhibition L-Phe could partially completely reversed L-Ala metal derivatives. mode inhibition pyruvate kinase L-Phe depended upon pH well nature activating divalent metal ions. sigmoidal response increased increasing pH metal derivatives inhibited L-Phe. L-Phe L-Ala strongly perturbed coordination sphere enzyme bound Co(II), Ni(II). poor correlations visible circular dichroic (cd) spectral changes corresponding kinetic changes. However, L-Phe (or) L-Ala induced ultraviolet cd difference absorption spectral changes, hand, corresponded remarkably well kinetic observations.
