 frequent cause death Friedreich's ataxia patients cardiomyopathy, molecular alterations underlying condition unknown. performed 2-DE characterize changes protein expression hearts using muscle creatine kinase frataxin conditional knockout (KO) mouse. Pronounced changes protein expression profile observed 9 week-old KO mice severe cardiomyopathy. contrast, several proteins showed altered expression asymptomatic 4 week-old KO mice. hearts frataxin KO mice, components iron-dependent complex-I -II mitochondrial electron transport chain enzymes involved ATP homeostasis (creatine kinase, adenylate kinase) displayed decreased expression. Interestingly, KO hearts exhibited increased expression enzymes involved citric acid cycle, catabolism branched-chain amino acids, ketone body utilization pyruvate decarboxylation. constitutes evidence metabolic compensation due decreased expression electron transport proteins. also pronounced up-regulation proteins involved stress protection, variety chaperones, well altered expression proteins involved cellular structure, motility general metabolism. first report molecular changes protein level could involved cardiomyopathy frataxin KO mouse.
