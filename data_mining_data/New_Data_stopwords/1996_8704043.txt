 new micromethod determination sphingomyelin samples suspended aqueous solutions, modified micromethods determining phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylglycerol used determine phosphatidylcholine sphingomyelin (detection limits 1.8 mumol/l), phosphatidylglycerol (detection limit 2.3 mumol/l) lipid dispersions, membranes sheep erythrocytes platelets, pulmonary surfactants rats different ages rats maintained normobaric hyperoxia 2 days prior sacrifice. procedures easy perform, accurate, require less sample conventional methods also applied directly aqueous samples. Phospholipase C sphingomyelinase used release phosphorylcholine phosphatidylglycerol sphingomyelin, respectively. choline released phosphorylcholine alkaline phosphatase reconverted phosphorylcholine ATP choline kinase. phophatidylglycerol determination, phospholipase used release glycerol phosphatidate. glycerol formed converted glycerolphosphate using ATP glycerol kinase. cases, ADP thus formed determined following enzymatic conversion NADH NAD 340 nm coupled pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system. Significant variations phospholipid composition rat pulmonary surfactant found development; particular increase phosphatidylglycerol content adult rats compared younger rats. Hyperoxia produced changes phosphatidylglycerol content surfactant adult rats, 2-day old rats.
