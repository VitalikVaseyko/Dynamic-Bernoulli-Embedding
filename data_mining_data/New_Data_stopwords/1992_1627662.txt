 Cytosolic free magnesium (Mgf) considered relatively constant. test concept, Mgf estimated hyperkalemic ventricular akinesis, normal maximum adrenergic stimulation, sulfate loading normoxic perfused guinea-pig heart. Mgf estimates utilized new sliding scale derived Mg(2+)-dependence glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/phosphoglycerate kinase (GAPDH/PGK). pseudo constant K'GAPDH.K'PGK measured ([creatine phosphate][3-phosphoglycerate][lactate]KLDH)/([creatine][Pi] [glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate][pyruvate]KCK), varied magnesium due KCK (CK, LDH = creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase). However, correct magnesium dependencies true constants KGAPDH.KPGK KCK taken literature. [Mg2+] pseudo K'GAPDH.K'PGK equalled true KGAPDH.KPGK best estimate Mgf.Mgf fell approximately 0.13 mM hyperkalemic arrest control approximately 0.6 mM, rising approximately 0.85 mM maximum adrenergic stress. Mgf increased approximately 1.3 mM sulfate loading induced ATP catabolism. Mgf ATP reciprocally related. Thus; (1) myocardial free [Mg2+] judged GADPH/PGK mass-action relations changed appreciably extreme physiological states; (2) ATP major chelator Mg2+ perfused myocardium, i.e., acute ATP pool size reduction may associated increments Mgf.
