 1. Six monoclonal antibodies specific pyruvate kinase foot muscle common limpet P. caerulea produced. 2. also exhibited specificity mouse liver L-type isoenzyme pyruvate kinase present. react mouse skeletal muscle, heart red blood cells isoenzymes pyruvate kinase (PK). One these, monoclonal antibody B react PK isoenzymes mouse tissues. 3. presence isoenzymic type PK recognized monoclonals, (type L), traced five phyla marine invertebrates application monoclonal antibodies A, B C. 4. two phyla majority animals found possess L-type PK isoenzyme muscles quite different isoenzymic type present tissues. results study compared existing literature, use monoclonal antibodies study enzymic systems considered discussion.
