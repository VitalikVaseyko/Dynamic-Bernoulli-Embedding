 1. effects recombinant human tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) murine interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1) activation state hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHa), activity mitochondrial PDH kinase, hepatic lipogenesis de novo plasma triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations studied. 2. Monokine effects depended upon prior nutritional state. rats fasted 20 h 45 h monokine administration refeeding (orally intravenous glucose), PDHa, TG hepatic lipogenesis increased. rats fed ad libitum, treatment TNF plus IL-1 increased contribution hepatic lipogenesis circulating TG 550% control values (P = 0.03) plasma TG concentrations 159% (P = 0.02), whereas PDHa increased slightly 120% (P = 0.02) liver glycogen content fell 45.8% (P = 0.05) control values. 3. Intrinsic hepatic PDH kinase activity changed monokine treatment rats fed ad libitum. 4. increased lipogenesis de novo showed correlation (r2 = 0.05, significant) hepatic PDHa individual animals fed ad libitum. 5. conclusion, results suggest monokines increase pyruvate flux hepatic PDH vivo rats fed ad libitum primarily mechanisms covalent modification PDH. Prior nutritional status exerts permissive effect monokine stimulation PDHa lipogenesis, consistent substrate-mediated action, mechanism permissive effect remains uncertain.
