 Hexokinase purified rabbit heart specific activity 70 U/mg protein. purified enzyme electrophoretically homogeneous apparent molecular weight 102,000. Purified immunoglobulins sheep used titrate percentage hexokinase various tissues rabbit. Precipitating antibodies sheep also prepared rabbit muscle MM-creatine kinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Apparent turnover rates phosphotransferases hexokinase determined rabbit heart soleus muscle means immunoprecipitation technique single pulse labelling [U-14Cl]leucine vivo. Apparent half-lives phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase hexokinase 0.56 d, 0.73 0.93 rabbit heart. slow-twitch soleus muscle half-lives phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase II creatine kinase 0.63 d, 0.72 d, 0.85 0.82 d. similarity rate constants degradation enzymes interpreted indication different tissue concentrations result primarily different rates synthesis.
