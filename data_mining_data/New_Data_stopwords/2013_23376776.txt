 Warburg effect known crucial cancer cells acquire energy. Nutrient deficiencies important phenomenon solid tumors, effect cancer cell metabolism yet clear. study, demonstrate starvation HeLa cells incubation Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) induced cell apoptosis, accompanied induction reactive oxygen species (ROS) production AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Notably, HBSS starvation increased lactate production, cytoplasmic pyruvate content decreased oxygen consumption, failed change lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity glucose uptake. found HBSS starvation rapidly induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation, inhibited compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), NAC (a ROS scavenger), dominant negative mutant AMPK. data revealed involvement ROS production AMPK activation. Moreover, DCA (a PDK inhibitor), NAC, compound C significantly decreased HBSS starvation-induced lactate production accompanied enhancement HBSS starvation-induced cell apoptosis. HeLa cells, HBSS-induced lactate production PDH phosphorylation also observed CL1.5, A431 human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Taken together, first time demonstrated low-nutrient condition drives cancer cells utilize glycolysis produce ATP, increases Warburg effect novel mechanism involving ROS/AMPK-dependent activation PDK. event contributes protecting cells apoptosis upon nutrient deprivation.
