 DNA methylation provides mechanism environmental factors control insulin sensitivity obesity. Here, assessed DNA methylation skeletal muscle obese people Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Obesity associated altered expression subset genes enriched metabolic process mitochondrial function. weight loss, expression majority identified genes normalized levels observed normal-weight, healthy controls. Among 14 metabolic genes analyzed, promoter methylation 11 genes normalized levels observed normal-weight, healthy subjects. Using bisulfite sequencing, show promoter methylation PGC-1alpha PDK4 altered obesity restored nonobese levels RYGB-induced weight loss. genome-wide DNA methylation analysis skeletal muscle revealed obesity associated hypermethylation CpG shores exonic regions close transcription start sites. results provide evidence obesity RYGB-induced weight loss dynamic effect epigenome.
