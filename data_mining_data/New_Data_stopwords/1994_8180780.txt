 Using immunohistochemical enzyme biochemical methods investigated expression L- M2-pyruvate kinase (PK) normal renal tissue, renal cell carcinomas (RCCs; clear cell, chromophilic cell mixed cell type) RCC metastases. L-PK expressed proximal tubules normal renal tissue and, variable extent, 23/25 primary RCCs, 1 RCC recurrence 10 RCC metastases. Staining intensity percentage stained tissue correlate tumour grade. One renal oncocytoma extrarenal malignancies examined lacked L-PK immunoreactivity. M2-PK mainly expressed distal tubules normal kidney found renal tumours well extrarenal malignancies. Quantitative biochemical investigations yielded two- seventeen-fold increase PK activity RCCs compared normal renal cortex taken patient, whereas fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity dramatically lower RCCs. Otherwise, activity enzymes investigated (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase lactate dehydrogenase) significantly changed RCCs. immunocytochemical results suggest L-PK useful marker RCC metastases, acetone-fixed tissue available. quantitative changes concentration PK enzymes RCCs compared normal renal tissue probably reflect metabolic alterations related tumour growth.
