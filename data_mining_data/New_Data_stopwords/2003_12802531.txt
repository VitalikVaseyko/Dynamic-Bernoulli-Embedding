 Metabolic flux analysis based 13C-labeling experiments followed measurement intracellular isotope distribution using 2D NMR GC-MS carried investigate effect pyruvate kinase (pyk) gene knockout metabolism Escherichia coli continuous culture. addition, activities 16 enzymes, concentrations 5 intracellular metabolites, measured function time batch culture well continuous culture. found flux phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase malic enzyme up-regulated pykF- mutant compared wild type, acetate formation significantly reduced mutant. addition, flux phosphofructose kinase pathway reduced oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway increased mutant. evidenced corresponding enzyme activities, increase concentrations phosphoenol pyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate 6-phosphogluconate, etc. also found continuous cultivation enzyme activities oxidative PP Entner-Doudoroff pathways increased dilution rate increased pykF- mutant. clarify metabolism quantitatively, found quite important integrate information intracellular metabolic flux distribution, enzyme activities intracellular metabolite concentrations.
