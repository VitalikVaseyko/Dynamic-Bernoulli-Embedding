 Zonula occludens proteins (ZOPs) essential scaffold proteins involved organization epithelial endothelial intercellular junctions. Based molecular domain architecture, members large family membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like (MAGUK) proteins. MAGUKs, ZOPs contain core several PDZ, src homology-3, guanylate kinase-like domain, indicating proteins may serve structural signaling functions. addition, ZOPs exhibit unique motifs shared MAGUKs, i.e., several nuclear localization (NLS) nuclear export signals (NES), allowing proteins shuttle cytoplasm nucleus. However, stimuli leading nuclear accumulation ZOPs resulting physiological consequences remain poorly defined. previously reported direct binding nuclear ZO-2 scaffold attachment factor B, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein involved chromatin organization transcriptional control eukaryotic genes. report nuclear accumulation ZO-2 leads increase expression M2 type pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) epithelial endothelial cells. Further, proliferative activity increased, intercellular junctional stability Madin-Darby canine kidney cells reduced. data provide evidence suggest ZO-2 exerts junction-unrelated function supports notion general "dual" role junctional MAGUKs, indispensable structural component cell-cell junctions nuclear factor influencing gene expression cell behavior.
