 Cancer cells exhibit altered glucose metabolism characterized preference aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect, cells resist matrix detachment-induced apoptosis, called anoikis, barrier metastasis. remains largely unclear whether tumor metabolism influences anoikis metastasis. show detached matrix, untransformed mammary epithelial cells undergo metabolic reprogramming markedly upregulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4 (PDK4) estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma), thereby inhibiting PDH attenuating flux glycolytic carbon mitochondrial oxidation. decipher significance metabolic response, found depletion PDK4 activation PDH increased mitochondrial respiration oxidative stress suspended cells, resulting heightened anoikis. Conversely, overexpression PDKs prolonged survival cells suspension. Therefore, decreased glucose oxidation following cell detachment confers anoikis resistance. Unlike untransformed cells, cancer cells demonstrate reduced glucose oxidation even attached conditions, thus inherently possess survival advantage suspended. Normalization glucose metabolism stimulating PDH cancer cells restores susceptibility anoikis impairs metastatic potential. results suggest Warburg effect, specifically, diminished glucose oxidation, promotes anoikis resistance metastasis PDKs potential targets antimetastasis therapy.
