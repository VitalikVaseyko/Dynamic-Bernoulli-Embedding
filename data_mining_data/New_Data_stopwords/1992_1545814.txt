 major DNA-binding protein, infected-cell protein 8 (ICP8), encoded herpes simplex virus localize cell nucleus independently viral proteins. define nuclear localization signals within ICP8, performed several forms mutagenesis cloned ICP8 gene. Deletion analysis ICP8 gene showed several portions ICP8 involved nuclear localization. determine whether regions independent localization signals, introduced various portions ICP8 gene series cassette plasmids allowed expression fusion proteins containing pyruvate kinase, normally cytoplasmic protein, fused various portions ICP8. results showed carboxyl-terminal 28 residues portion ICP8 capable targeting protein kinase nucleus. However, inclusion certain additional regions ICP8 fusion protein led inhibition nuclear localization. Therefore, carboxyl-terminal 28 residues ICP8 act independently nuclear localization signal, certain conformational constraints folding assembly requirements remainder protein affect nuclear localization protein. results demonstrate sequences distant nuclear localization signal affect ability function. set fusion vectors isolated general use making 5' 3' fusions reading frame rapidly map localization signals.
