 experiment performed determine fetus influence placental metabolism. Fetal pigs decapitated 45 days gestation placentas compared 110 days within litter controls. histological histochemical differences observed. Glycogen levels elevated fetal placenta decapitated pigs 107%. Fatty acid synthesis increased fetal placenta decapitated animals (12.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.7 nmol acetate units/100 mg/2 h). Fetal decapitation increased fetal placental fatty acid esterification 43% oxidation 125%. altered lipid metabolism fetal placenta reflected enzymes associated substrate utilization (pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase). Maternal placenta lipogenesis also altered fetal manipulation. Leucine conversion alpha ketoacid increased fetal placenta decapitated pigs (14.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.4 nmol/100 mg/2 h) indicating amino acid metabolism affected treatment. ability altered fetal endocrinology metabolism affect placental metabolism supports concept fetal influence placental metabolism.
