 Iron accumulation associated several pathological conditions Friedreich ataxia. human disorder caused decreased expression frataxin. Iron-overload triggers oxidative stress, main targets stress known. yeast cells lacking frataxin ortholog YFH1, identified set 14 carbonylated proteins, include mitochondrial ATP synthase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, molecular chaperones. Interestingly, target proteins magnesium- and/or nucleotide-binding proteins. key feature leads us postulate iron accumulates, chelatable iron replaces magnesium corresponding metal-binding site, promoting selective damage proteins. Consistent hypothesis, vitro experiments performed pure pyruvate kinase phosphoglycerate kinase showed oxidation proteins prevented magnesium increased presence ATP. Also, chelatable iron, forms complexes nucleotides, showed sevenfold increase Deltayfh1 cells. Moreover, lowering chelatable iron Deltayfh1 cells desferrioxamine prevented enzyme inactivation. general conclusion, propose magnesium bound proteins replaced chelatable iron metal accumulates. mechanism explains selective protein oxidation provides clues better understanding iron-overloading pathologies.
