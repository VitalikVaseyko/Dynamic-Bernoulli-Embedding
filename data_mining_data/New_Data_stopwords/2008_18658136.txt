 Human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) down-regulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms 1-4. PDK4 overexpressed skeletal muscle type 2 diabetes, resulting impaired glucose utilization. show human PDK4 robust core-free basal activity, considerably higher activity levels PDK isoforms stimulated PDC core. PDK4 binds L3 lipoyl domain, activity significantly stimulated individual lipoyl domains core PDC. 2.0-A crystal structures PDK4 dimer bound ADP reveal open conformation wider active-site cleft, compared closed conformation epitomized PDK2-ADP structure. open conformation PDK4 shows partially ordered C-terminal cross-tails, conserved DW (Asp(394)-Trp(395)) motif one subunit anchors N-terminal domain subunit. open conformation fosters reduced binding affinity ADP, facilitating efficient removal product inhibition nucleotide. Alteration deletion DW-motif disrupts C-terminal cross-tail anchor, resulting closed conformation nearly complete inactivation PDK4. Fluorescence quenching enzyme activity data suggest compounds AZD7545 dichloroacetate lock PDK4 open closed conformational states, respectively. propose PDK4 bound ADP exists equilibrium open closed conformations. favored metastable open conformation responsible robust basal activity PDK4 absence PDC core.
