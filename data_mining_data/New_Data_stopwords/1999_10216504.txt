 diagnostic value tumor marker pyruvate kinase type tumor M2 evaluated patients benign, malignant metastasizing pancreatic lesions compared reference markers CA19-9 CEA. prospective study comprised 166 individuals; 66 patients various pancreatic pathologies (38 histologically proven pancreatic cancer, 28 benign pancreatic lesions pseudotumorous pancreatitis, pseudocysts pancreatic (cyst)adenoma) 100 healthy blood donors served controls. cut-off value 28 U/ml (corresponding specificity 90%) sensitivity TUM2-PK pancreatic cancer (as related control group) 79% (CA19-9: 65%, CEA: 22%). good correlation TUM2-PK levels tumor metastasis (p < 0.001 versus distant metastasis, p = n.s. CA19-9 CEA). However, TUM2-PK also elevated 64.3% patients benign pancreatic pathologies. study TUM2-PK good diagnostic qualities pancreatic cancer also showed better correlation metastasis CA 19-9 CEA.
