 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) hypothesized link lipid exposure skeletal muscle insulin resistance glucose-fatty acid cycle increased fatty acid oxidation increases acetyl-CoA concentrations, thereby inactivating PDH decreasing glucose oxidation. However, whether fatty acids induce insulin resistance decreasing PDH flux remains unknown. genetically examine hypothesis assessed relative rates pyruvate dehydrogenase flux/mitochondrial oxidative flux insulin-stimulated rates muscle glucose metabolism awake mice lacking pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 4 [double knockout (DKO)], results constitutively activated PDH. Surprisingly, increased glucose oxidation DKO muscle accompanied reduced insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake. Preferential myocellular glucose utilization DKO mice decreased fatty acid oxidation, resulting increased reesterification acyl-CoAs diacylglycerol triacylglycerol, subsequent activation PKC-theta inhibition insulin signaling muscle. contrast, putative mediators muscle insulin resistance, including muscle acylcarnitines, ceramides, reactive oxygen species production, oxidative stress markers, increased. findings demonstrate modulation oxidative substrate selection increase muscle glucose utilization surprisingly results muscle insulin resistance, offering genetic evidence glucose-fatty acid cycle hypothesis muscle insulin resistance.
