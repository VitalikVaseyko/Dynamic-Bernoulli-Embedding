 objective experiment determine effect polyunsaturated fatty acids gene expression fatty acid synthase, acetyl CoA-carboxylase, malic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase obese mice. Eight-week-old female lean obese mice fed semi-purified diets containing 20% (w/w) fat either high low polyunsaturated saturated (P/S) fatty acid ratio four weeks. Total RNA isolated liver hybridized cDNA probes enzymes. Consumption high P/S diet decreased mRNA levels lipogenic enzymes studied lean obese mice. Compared lean mice, obese mice exhibited higher mRNA level fatty acid synthase, acetyl CoA-carboxylase, malic enzyme, pyruvate kinase animals fed either high low P/S diet. Enzyme-specific activities followed profile mRNA levels lean obese mice fed high low P/S diet. decrease liver fatty acid synthase mRNA level pronounced lean mice compared obese mice, suggesting obese mice may resistant polyunsaturated fatty acid feedback control gene expression.
