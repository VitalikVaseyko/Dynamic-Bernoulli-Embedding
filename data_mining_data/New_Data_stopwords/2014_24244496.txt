 Mpc proteins highly conserved yeast humans necessary uptake pyruvate inner mitochondrial membrane, used leucine valine biosynthesis fuel respiration. analysis yeast MPC gene family suggests amino acid biosynthesis, respiration rate oxidative stress tolerance regulated changes Mpc protein composition mitochondria. Mpc2 Mpc3 highly similar functionally different: Mpc2 abundant fermentative non stress conditions important amino acid biosynthesis, Mpc3 abundant family member upon salt stress high respiration rates required. Accordingly, expression MPC3 gene highly activated upon NaCl stress transition fermentation respiration, types regulation depend Hog1 MAP kinase. Overexpression experiments show gain Mpc2 function leads severe respiration defect ROS accumulation, Mpc3 stimulates respiration enhances tolerance oxidative stress. results identify regulated mitochondrial pyruvate uptake important determinant respiration rate stress resistance.
