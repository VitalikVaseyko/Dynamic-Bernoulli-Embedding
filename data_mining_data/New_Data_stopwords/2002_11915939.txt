 finding mitochondria contain substrates protein kinases lead discovery protein kinases located mitochondria certain tissues species. include pyruvate dyhydrogenase kinase, branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, protein kinase A, protein kinase Cdelta, stress-activated kinase A-Raf well unidentified kinases. Recent evidence suggests mitochondrial protein kinases may involved physiological processes apoptosis steroidogenesis. Additionally, novel finding low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins mitochondria suggests possibility may interact mitochondrial protein kinases regulate activity mitochondrial effector proteins. fact components cellular regulatory systems mitochondria indicates exciting possibility undiscovered systems regulating mitochondrial physiology.
