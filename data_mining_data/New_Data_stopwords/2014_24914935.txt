 Menopause associated increased visceral adiposity disrupted glucose homeostasis, underlying molecular mechanisms related metabolic changes still elusive. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays key role energy expenditure may regulated sexual steroids, alterations glucose homeostasis could precede increased weight gain ovariectomy. Thus, aim work evaluate metabolic pathways BAT liver may disrupted early ovariectomy. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats increased food efficiency early 12 days ovariectomy, could explained differences feces content. Analysis isolated BAT mitochondria function revealed differences citrate synthase activity, uncoupling protein 1 expression, oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, heat production OVX rats. addition GDP BSA inhibit uncoupling protein 1 decreased oxygen consumption BAT mitochondria equally groups. Liver analysis revealed increased triglyceride content accompanied decreased levels phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase OVX animals. elevated expression gluconeogenic enzymes OVX OVX + estradiol rats associated alterations glucose tolerance test serum insulin coincident higher glucose disposal pyruvate tolerance test. Although estradiol treatment prevented ovariectomy-induced increase body weight hepatic triglyceride cholesterol accumulation, able prevent increased gluconeogenesis. conclusion, disrupted liver glucose homeostasis ovariectomy neither caused estradiol deficiency related increased body mass.
