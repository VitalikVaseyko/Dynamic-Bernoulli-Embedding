 review, discuss way insights evolutionary theory systems biology shed light form function mammalian reproductive systems. first part review, contrast rapid evolution seen reproductive genes generally conservative nature development. discuss directional selection coevolution potential drivers rapid evolution sperm egg proteins. rapid change different highly conservative nature later embryo development. However, unique, regions sex chromosomes also show elevated rates evolutionary change. explain contradictory trends, argue reproductive functions per se induce rapid evolution. Rather, fact biotic interactions, speciation events sexual conflict, evolutionary endpoint hence drive continuous evolutionary changes. Returning question sex chromosome evolution, discuss way recent advances evolutionary genomics systems biology and, particular, development theory gene balance provide better understanding evolutionary patterns seen chromosomes. end review discussion surprising incompletely understood phenomenon observed early embryos: namely Warburg effect, whereby glucose fermented lactate alanine rather respired carbon dioxide. argue evolutionary insights, yeasts tumor cells, help explain Warburg effect, new metabolic modeling approaches useful assessing potential sources effect.
