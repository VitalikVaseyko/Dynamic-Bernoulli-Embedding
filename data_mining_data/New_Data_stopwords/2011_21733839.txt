 Ehrlich's pioneering chemotherapeutic experiments published 1904 (Ehrlich, P., Shiga, K. (1904) Berlin Klin. Wochenschrift 20, 329-362) described efficacy series dye molecules including trypan blue trypan red eliminate trypanosome infections mice. molecular structures dyes provided starting point synthesis suramin, developed used trypanocidal drug 1916 still clinical use. Despite biological importance dye-like molecules, mode action trypanosomes remained elusive. present crystal structures suramin three related dyes complex pyruvate kinases Leishmania mexicana Trypanosoma cruzi. phenyl sulfonate groups four molecules (suramin, Ponceau S, acid blue 80, benzothiazole-2,5-disulfonic acid) bind position ADP/ATP active sites pyruvate kinases (PYKs). binding positions two different trypanosomatid PYKs nearly identical. show suramin competitively inhibits PYKs humans (muscle, tumor, liver isoenzymes, K(i) = 1.1-17 muM), T. cruzi (K(i) = 108 muM), L. mexicana (K(i) = 116 muM), similar active sites. Synergistic effects observed examining suramin inhibition presence allosteric effector molecule, whereby IC(50) values decreased 2-fold trypanosomatid human PYKs. kinetic structural analyses provide insight promiscuous inhibition observed suramin mode action dye-like molecules used Ehrlich's original experiments.
