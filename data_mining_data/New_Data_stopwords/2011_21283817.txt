 BACKGROUND: Exposure cigarette smoke major risk factor head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). previously established chronic cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated human oral normal keratinocyte model, demonstrating elevated frequency mitochondrial mutations CSE treated cells. Using model characterized mechanism chronic CSE treatment induces increased cellular proliferation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: demonstrate chronic CSE treatment upregulates PDK2 expression, decreases PDH activity thereby increases glycolytic metabolites pyruvate lactate. also found chronic CSE treatment enhanced HIF1alpha accumulation increased pyruvate lactate production manner selectively reversible ascorbate. Use HIF1alpha small molecule inhibitor blocked growth induced chronic CSE treatment OKF6 cells. Furthermore, chronic CSE treatment found increase ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, application ROS scavengers N-acetylcysteine abrogated expression PDK2 HIF1alpha. Notably, treatment dichloroacetate, PDK2 inhibitor, also decreased HIF1alpha expression well cell proliferation chronic CSE treated OKF6 cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: findings suggest chronic CSE treatment contribute cell growth via increased ROS production mitochondrial mutations, upregulation PDK2, attenuating PDH activity thereby increasing glycolytic metabolites, resulting HIF1alpha stabilization. study suggests role chronic tobacco exposure development aerobic glycolysis normoxic HIFalpha activation part HNSCC initiation. data may provide insights development chemopreventive strategies smoking related cancers.
