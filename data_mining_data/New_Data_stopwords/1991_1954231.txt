 progress curve enzyme catalysed reaction follows integrated Michaelis-Menten equation, maximum velocity Michaelis constant determined single curve. paper, experimental design collecting data proposed close optimum sense produces smallest standard error estimate Michaelis constant. design involves choosing initial substrate concentration approx. two three times value Michaelis constant.
