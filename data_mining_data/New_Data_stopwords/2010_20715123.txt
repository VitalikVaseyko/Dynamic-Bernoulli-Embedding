 Phosphorylation posttranslational protein modification common subject proteomic studies, phosphorylation mitochondria still poorly investigated. study presented applied 2-DE characterize phosphorylation yeast mitochondrial proteome identified 59 spots corresponding 34 phosphorylated mitochondrial mitochondria-associated proteins. proteins presented putative substrates mitogen-activated protein target rapamycin kinases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cyclin-dependent kinases Snf1p suggesting key players phosphorylation mitochondrial mitochondria-associated proteins. dynamic behaviour phosphoproteome major metabolic change, shift fermentation respiration (diauxic shift), studied. Eight proteins (Ald4p, Eft1p/2p, Eno1p, Eno2p, Om14p, Pda1p, Qcr2p, Sdh1p) growth dependent changes phosphorylation, indicating role phosphorylation-dependent regulation translation, metabolic pathways (e.g. glucose fermentation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass) respiratory chain.
