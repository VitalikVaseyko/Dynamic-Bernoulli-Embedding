 BACKGROUND: cardioprotective benefits bradykinin attributable activation B(2) receptor (B(2)R)-mediated actions abolished B(2)R antagonists. current experiments evaluated cardioprotective potential potent, long-acting B(2)R-selective agonist peptide analogue bradykinin, compound NG291. METHODS: compared extent cardiac tissue damage remodeling expression pattern selected genes mice submitted acute myocardial infarct (MI) treated 1 week either NG291 [Hyp(3),Thi(5),(N)Chg(7),Thi(8)]-bradykinin saline delivered via osmotic minipump. RESULTS: Active treatment resulted better ejection fraction (EF) 69 +/- 1% vs. 61 +/- 3.1% (P = 0.01), (vs. 85 +/- 1.3% sham-operated controls), fractional shortening (FS) 38 +/- 4% vs. 32 +/- 8% (NS) (vs. 53 +/- 1.2 sham-operated controls), fewer markers myocyte apoptosis (TUNEL-positive nuclei 4.9 +/- 1.1% vs. 9.7 +/- 0.03%, P = 0.03). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) end point normal 110 +/- 4.2 actively treated mice, tended lower 104 +/- 4.7 mm Hg saline controls decreased cardiac systolic capacity. Expression patterns selected genes factors related tissue injury, inflammation, metabolism (i.e., B(1)R, B(2)R, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), TNF-alpha, cardiomyopathy-associated 3 (Cmya3), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4)) showed acute MI induced significant upregulation genes, active treatment prevented attenuated upregulation, whereas B(2)R agonist produced difference myocardium sham-operated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment selective B(2)R agonist initiated time induction acute MI mice beneficial effect cardiac function, tissue remodeling, inflammation-related tissue gene expression, may explain structural functional benefits.
