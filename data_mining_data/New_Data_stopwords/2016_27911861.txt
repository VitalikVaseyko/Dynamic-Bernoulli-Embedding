 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key enzyme Warburg effect plays central role cancer cell metabolic reprogramming. Recently, quite studies investigated correlation PKM2 expression prognosis multiple cancer patients, results inconsistent. therefore performed meta-analysis explore prognostic value PKM2 expression patients solid cancer. twenty-seven individual studies 25 publications total 4796 cases included explore association PKM2 overall survival (OS) disease-free survival (DFS)/ progression-free survival (PFS)/ recurrent-free survival (RFS) subjects solid cancer. Pooled analysis showed high levels PKM2 significantly associated poorer overall survival (HR = 1.73; 95%CI = 1.48-2.03) DFS/ PFS/ RFS (HR = 1.90; 95%CI = 1.39-2.59) irrespective cancer types. Different analysis models (univariate multivariate models), sample-sizes (</=100 >100), methods data collection (direct extraction indirect extraction) impact negative prognostic effect PKM2 over-expression. Nevertheless, stratified cancer type, high-expression PKM2 associated unfavorable OS breast cancer, esophageal squamous carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma gallbladder cancer; whereas correlated worse OS pancreatic cancer gastric cancer. conclusion, over-expression PKM2 associated poor prognosis solid cancers might potentially useful biomarker predicting cancer prognosis future clinical applications.
