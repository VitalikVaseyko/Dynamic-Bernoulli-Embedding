 fields tumor metabolism immune oncology independently received considerable attention last several years. majority research tumor metabolism largely focused Warburg effect resulting biologic consequences, including energy macromolecule production. However, recent investigations identified elegant, multifaceted strategies alterations tumor metabolism also contribute potent tolerogenic immune environment. One notable increased tryptophan metabolism activation indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). However, pathway represents one numerous metabolic pathways may modulate immune system. example, metabolites associated aerobic glycolysis, adenosine, arginine, prostaglandin metabolism implicated cancer-mediated immune tolerance represent attractive therapeutic targets. review, provide overview emerging interface 2 timely areas cancer research provide overview strategies currently tested target next-generation metabolic immune checkpoints.
