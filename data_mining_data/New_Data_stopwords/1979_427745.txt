 Carbohydrate metabolism four rat hepatoma cell lines culture, namely, Reuber H35, MH1C1, RLC, HTC, investigated. Glucose utilization H35 MH1C1 cells lower RLC HTC cells. four cell lines also differ respect accumulation lactic acid growth medium; particular, H35 cells show uptake lactic acid, rather accumulation medium. Specific activities number enzymes involved glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen formation determined four cell lines. direct relationship differences found activities enzymes belonging carbohydrate metabolism, namely, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, aldolases B, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase differences found glucose utilization different cell lines.
