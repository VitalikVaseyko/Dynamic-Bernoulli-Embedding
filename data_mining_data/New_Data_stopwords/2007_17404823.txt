 introductory article review series entitled "The Cancer Cell's Power Plants Promising Therapeutic Targets" written 20 million people suffer cancer. summarizes strategies destroy prevent cancers targeting energy production factories, i.e., "power plants." nucleated animal/human cells two types power plants, i.e., systems make "high energy" compound ATP ADP P( ). One type "glycolysis," "mitochondria." contrast normal cells mitochondria major ATP producers (>90%) fueling growth, human cancers detected via Positron Emission Tomography (PET) rely types power plants. cancers, glycolysis may contribute nearly half ATP even presence oxygen ("Warburg effect"). Based solely cell energetics, presents challenge identify curative agents destroy cancer cells must destroy power plants causing "necrotic cell death" leave normal cells alone. One agent, 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), lactic acid analog, shown inhibit glycolytic mitochondrial ATP production rapidly growing cancers (Ko et al., Cancer Letts., 173, 83-91, 2001), leave normal cells alone, eradicate advanced cancers (19 19) rodent model (Ko et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 324, 269-275, 2004). second approach induce cancer cells undergo "apoptotic cell death." Here, mitochondria release cell death inducing factors (e.g., cytochrome c). third approach, cancer cells induced die apoptotic necrotic events. summary, much effort focused identifying agents induce "necrotic," "apoptotic" apoptotic plus necrotic cell death cancer cells. Regardless death inflicted, every cancer cell must die, fast slow.
