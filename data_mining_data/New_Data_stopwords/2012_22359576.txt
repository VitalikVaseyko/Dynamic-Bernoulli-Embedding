 AMPK, master metabolic switch, mediates observed increase glucose uptake locomotory muscle mammals exercise. AMPK activated changes intracellular AMP:ATP ratio ATP consumption stimulated contractile activity also AICAR metformin, compounds increase glucose transport mammalian muscle cells. However, possible role AMPK regulation glucose metabolism skeletal muscle investigated vertebrates, including fish. study, investigated effects AMPK activators glucose uptake, AMPK activity, cell surface levels trout GLUT4 expression GLUT1 GLUT4 well expression enzymes regulating glucose disposal PGC1alpha trout myotubes derived primary muscle cell culture. show AICAR metformin significantly stimulated glucose uptake (1.6 1.3 fold, respectively) Compound C completely abrogated stimulatory effects AMPK activators glucose uptake. combination insulin AMPK activators result additive synergistic effects glucose uptake. Moreover, exposure trout myotubes AICAR metformin resulted increase AMPK activity (3.8 3 fold, respectively). also provide evidence suggesting stimulation glucose uptake AMPK activators trout myotubes may take place, least part, increasing cell surface mRNA levels trout GLUT4. Finally, AICAR increased mRNA levels genes involved glucose disposal (hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase citrate synthase) mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1alpha) affect glycogen content glycogen synthase mRNA levels trout myotubes. Therefore, provide evidence, first time non-mammalian vertebrates, suggesting potentially important role AMPK stimulating glucose uptake utilization skeletal muscle fish.
