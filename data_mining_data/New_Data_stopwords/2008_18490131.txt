 explored genetic basis intraspecific variation mycoplasmal sialidase activity correlates virulence, potentially advantageous linkage nutrient catabolism. Polymorphism N-acetylneuraminate scavenging degradation genes (sialidase, N-acetylneuraminate lyase, N-acetylmannosamine kinase, N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate epimerase, N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase, glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase) evident among eight strains avian pathogen Mycoplasma synoviae. differences single nucleotide polymorphisms, ranging 0.34+/-0.04 substitutions per 100 bp N-acetylmannosamine kinase 0.65+/-0.03 single-copy sialidase gene nanI. Missense mutations twice common silent mutations nanI; 26% resulted amino acids dissimilar consensus; 12-base deletion near nanI promoter strain WVU1853(T), supporting complex genetic basis differences sialidase activity. Two strains identical frameshifts N-acetylneuraminate lyase gene nanA, resulting nonsense mutations, downstream deletions nanA. genetic lesions uncouple extracellular liberation sialic acid generation fructose-6-phosphate pyruvate via intracellular N-acetylneuraminate degradation.
