 objective study assess influence temperature coupling among energy failure, depolarization, ionic fluxes anoxia. end, induced anoxia cardiac arrest anesthetized rats maintained body temperature either 34 degrees C 40 degrees C, measured extracellular K+ concentration (K+e), froze neocortex exposed dura measurements phosphocreatine (PCr), creatine (Cr), ATP, ADP, AMP, glucose, glycogen, pyruvate lactate content ischemic intervals maximally 130 s. Free ADP (ADPf) concentrations derived creatine kinase equilibrium. Hypothermia reduced initial rate rise K+e, delayed terminal depolarization; however, hypo- hyperthermic animals showed massive loss ion homeostasis K+e 10-15 mM. initial rate rise K+e correlate changes ATP, ATP/ADPf ratio, suggesting temperature changes per se may control degree activation K+ conductances. results clearly showed that, hyper- hypothermic subjects, energy failure preceded sudden activation membrane conductances ions. results indicate temperature primarily influences membrane permeability ions like K+e (and Na+), cerebral energy state secondarily affected. proposed higher rate rise K+e high temperatures accelerates ATP hydrolysis primarily enhancing metabolic rate glial cells.
