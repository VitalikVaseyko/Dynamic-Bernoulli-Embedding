 Viruses evolved sophisticated strategies exploit host cell function benefit. show physiologically normal oxygen levels (normoxia) vaccinia virus (VACV) infection leads rapid stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, translocation nucleus activation HIF-responsive genes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter-1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1. HIF-1alpha stabilization mediated VACV protein C16 binds human oxygen sensing enzyme prolyl-hydroxylase domain containing protein (PHD)2 thereby inhibits PHD2-dependent hydroxylation HIF-1alpha. binding C16 PHD2 direct specific, ectopic expression C16 alone induces transcription HIF-1alpha responsive genes. Conversely, VACV strain lacking gene C16, C16L, unable induce HIF-1alpha stabilization. Interestingly, N-terminal region C16 predicted PHD2-like structural fold lacks catalytic active site residues PHDs. induction hypoxic response VACV reminiscent biochemical consequences solid tumor formation, illustrates poxvirus strategy manipulation cellular gene expression biochemistry.
