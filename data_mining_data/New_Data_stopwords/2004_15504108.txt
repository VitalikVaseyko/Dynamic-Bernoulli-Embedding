 transacetylase component (E2) PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) plays critical role regulation PDHK (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) activity. present study undertaken investigate molecular mechanism E2 modulates activity PDHK. agreement earlier results, found inner L2 (lipoyl-bearing domain 2) E2 expressed without C-terminal hinge region little, any, effect kinase activity, indicating lack direct allosteric effect L2 PDHK. marked contrast, significant activation PDHK observed construct consisting L2 E1BD (E1-binding domain) E2 (L2-E1BD didomain) suggesting co-localization and/or mutual orientation PDHK E1, facilitated E2 binding, largely account activation PDHK transacetylase component. Isothermal titration calorimetry glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays established binding adenyl nucleotides PDHK molecule facilitated release L2 domain. contrast, binding L2 domain caused significant decrease affinity PDHK ATP. cross-talk binding adenyl nucleotides L2 domain PDHK may indicate existence highly integrated mechanism whereby exchange lipoyl-bearing domains presented PDHK E2 coupled ADP/ATP exchange.
