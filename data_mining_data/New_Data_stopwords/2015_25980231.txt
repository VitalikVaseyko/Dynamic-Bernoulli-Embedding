 known production energy synthesis macromolecules cancer cells depend glucose metabolism greater extent non-tumor. paper carry comparative study effectiveness two modifiers glycolysis 2 - D-deoxyglucose (2-DG) dichloroacetate (DCA) induction cell death, changes cell cycle progression alteration intracellular ROS levels endothelial cells (line ECV304) human carcinoma cells (line HeLa G-63) order identify cause-effect relations events. shown inhibition various stages glycolysis result blocking cells C2/M phase cell cycle induction cell death. effect record HeLa G-63 cells only. DCA inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2-DG inhibitor glucose transport glycosylation induced selective dose-dependent cytotoxic effect HeLa G-63 cells. increase intracellular levels oxygen radicals induced DCA cells HeLa G-63 suggests cytotoxic effect DCA mediated activation mitochondrial functions. cytotoxic effect 2-DG depend level glucose culture medium, therefore suggest oxidative stress, energy depletion involved selective response cancer cells actions inhibitors glycolysis.
