 Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent subpopulation tumor cells endowed self-renewal capacity considered underlying cause tumor recurrence metastasis. metabolic signatures CSCs mechanisms involved regulation stem cell-like properties still remain elusive. utilized nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) CSCs model dissect metabolic signatures found CSCs underwent metabolic shift mitochondrial resetting distinguished differentiated counterparts. metabolic shift, CSCs showed greater reliance glycolysis energy supply compared parental cells. mitochondrial resetting, quantity function mitochondria CSCs modulated biogenesis organelles, round-shaped mitochondria distributed peri-nuclear manner similar seen stem cells. addition, blocked glycolytic pathway, increased ROS levels, depolarized mitochondrial membranes CSCs, respectively, examined effects metabolic factors CSC properties. Intriguingly, properties CSCs curbed redirected quintessential metabolic reprogramming, indicates plasticity energy metabolism regulated balance acquisition loss stemness status. Taken together, suggest metabolic reprogramming critical CSCs sustain self-renewal, deter differentiation enhance antioxidant defense mechanism. Characterization metabolic reprogramming governing CSC properties paramount design novel therapeutic strategies metabolic intervention CSCs.
