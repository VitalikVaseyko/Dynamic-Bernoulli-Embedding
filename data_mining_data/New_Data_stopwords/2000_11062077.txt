 previously reported [Xie, Li, Mechin van de Werve (1999) Biochem. J. 343, 393-396] dietary phosphate deprivation 2 days up-regulated catalytic subunit putative glucose-6-phosphate translocase rat liver microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase system, suggesting increased hepatic glucose production might responsible frequent clinical association hypophosphataemia glucose intolerance. show liver cAMP increased rats fed diet deficient P(i) compared rats fed control diet. Accordingly, P(i)-deficient group pyruvate kinase inactivated, concentration phosphoenolpyruvate increased fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate concentration decreased. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity marginally increased glucokinase activity unchanged P(i) deprivation. liver glycogen concentration decreased P(i)-deficient group. fed state, plasma glucose concentration increased plasma P(i) insulin concentrations substantially decreased P(i)-deficient group. changes, except decreased plasma P(i), cancelled overnight fasted P(i)-deficient group. fasted P(i)-deficient group, immediately glucose bolus, plasma glucose level elevated inhibition endogenous glucose production decreased. However, mild glucose intolerance sufficient affect rate fall glucose level glucose bolus. Taken together, changes compatible stimulation liver gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis P(i)-deficient diet indicate liver might contribute impaired glucose homeostasis P(i)-deficient states.
