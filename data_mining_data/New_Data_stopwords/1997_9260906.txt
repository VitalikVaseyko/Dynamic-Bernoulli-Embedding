 report describes establishment characterization mhPKT cell line derived liver transgenic mouse harboring simian virus (SV40) large small antigens placed control 5' regulatory sequence rat L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene. mhPKT cells prolonged life span, expressed SV40-encoded nuclear large antigen grown glucose-enriched medium, induced tumors injected subcutaneously athymic (nu-nu) mice. Growth petri dishes filters yielded multiple layers cuboid cells, numerous spaces adjacent cells closed junctional complexes. bile canaliculi-like structures exhibited numerous microvilli villin, actin-binding brush-border protein, colocalized actin. bile canaliculi-like structures appeared functional accumulated fluorescein. mhPKT cells conserved expression liver-specific transcription factors HNF1, HNF3, HNF4, DBP together substantial levels L-PK albumin alpha-fetoprotein mRNA transcripts. mhPKT cells mainly metabolized testosterone androstenedione 6beta-hydroxytestosterone, vivo. 3-Methylcholanthrene 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) markedly increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity related cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1/2 protein, whereas alpha-naphtoflavone antagonized TCDD-elicited induction. Phenobarbital slightly increased CYP2B-mediated activities pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase, 2beta- 16beta-testosterone hydroxylase. mhPKT cells also substantial sulfotransferase, UDP-glucuronyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase activities. model may serve tool long-term vitro studies xenobiotic metabolism, potent CYP inducers, hepatocyte damage due drugs factors.
