 ability glucagon adrenaline affect concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate isolated hepatocytes re-investigated important discrepancies existing literature. unable detect significant difference sensitivity hepatocytes regard effect glucagon initiate interconversion phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase, also cause disappearance fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. contrast, observed differences time-course various changes, since interconversions phosphorylase pyruvate kinase least twice fast 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. measured cell-free system presence MgATP, cyclic AMP-dependent interconversion pyruvate kinase 5-10-fold rapid 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. data indicate 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase relatively poor substrates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; also support hypothesis two catalytic activities belong single protein. Adrenaline slight effect several parameters investigation, except activation phosphorylase. absence Ca2+ ions incubation medium, however, adrenaline effect similar glucagon.
