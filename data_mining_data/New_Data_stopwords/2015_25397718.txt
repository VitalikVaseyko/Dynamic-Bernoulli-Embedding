 Gallic acid (GA) long associated wide range biological activities. study, antitumor effect B16F10 melanoma cells demonstrated MTT assay, cell migration assay, wound-healing assay, flow cytometric analysis. GA concentration >200 muM shows apoptotic activity toward B16F10 cells. According Western blotting data, overexpressions cleaved forms caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP-1 pro-apoptotic Bax Bad, accompanied underexpressed anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 Bcl-xL indicate GA induces B16F10 cell apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway. 2-DE based comparative proteomics employed B16F10 cells without GA treatment large-scale protein expression profiling. total 41 differential protein spots quantified, identities characterized using LC-MS/MS analysis database matching. addition regulated proteins associated apoptosis, interestingly, identified proteins involved glycolysis glucokinase, alpha-enolase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, GAPDH simultaneously up-regulated, reveals GA-induced cellular apoptosis B16 melanoma cells associated metabolic glycolysis.
