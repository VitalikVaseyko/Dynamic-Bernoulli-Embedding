 allosterically regulated pyruvate kinase type (PKI) E. coli inactivated ATP analog 2',3'-dialdehyde ATP (o-ATP) Ki 3.6 mM. ATP phosphoenolpyruvate protected enzyme activity allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate enhanced rate inactivation. Incubation o-ATP, followed reduction formed Schiff bases radioactive sodium borohydride, employed determine ATP binding sites PKI. tryptic digestion, purification labelled peptides sequence analysis allowed identify four modified lysyl residues, namely Lys173, Lys175, Lys272, Lys317 known DNA-deduced sequence PKI. close lysines 173 175 reacted o-ATP mutually exclusive way accounted together 53% recovered radioactivity, rest distributed Lys272 (31%) Lys317 (16%). fitted available three-dimensional structure muscle pyruvate kinase, position modified lysines defines catalytic allosteric ATP binding sites PKI.
