 Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis, characterized increased lactate production. distinctive metabolism involves expression embryonic M2 isozyme pyruvate kinase, contrast M1 isozyme normally expressed differentiated cells, confers proliferative advantage tumor cells. M1 M2 pyruvate-kinase isozymes expressed single gene alternative splicing pair mutually exclusive exons. measured expression M1 M2 mRNA protein isoforms mouse tissues, tumor cell lines, terminal differentiation muscle cells, show alternative splicing regulation sufficient account levels expressed protein isoforms. show M1-specific exon actively repressed cancer-cell lines--although M1 mRNA expressed cell lines derived brain tumors--and demonstrate related splicing repressors hnRNP A1 A2, well polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein PTB, contribute control. Downregulation splicing repressors cancer-cell lines using shRNAs rescues M1 isoform expression decreases extent lactate production. findings extend links alternative splicing cancer, begin define factors responsible switch aerobic glycolysis.
