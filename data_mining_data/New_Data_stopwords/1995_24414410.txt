 Hyperthermophiles characterized temperature optimum growth 80 110 degrees C. considered represent ancient phenotype living organisms thus metabolic design might reflect situation early stage evolution. modes metabolism diverse include chemolithoautotrophic chemoorganoheterotrophic. extant phototrophic hyperthermophiles known. Lithotrophic energy metabolism mostly anaerobic microaerophilic based oxidation H2 coupled reduction S, inf4 (sup2-) , CO2 inf3 (sup-) rarely O2. substrates derived volcanic activities hyperthermophilic habitats. lithotrophic energy metabolism hyperthermophiles appears similar mesophiles. Autotrophic CO2 fixation proceeds via reductive citric acid cycle, considered one first metabolic cycles, via reductive acetyl-CoA/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase pathway. Calvin cycle found hyperthermophiles (or Archaea). Organotrophic metabolism mainly involves peptides sugars substrates, either oxidized CO2 external electron acceptors fermented acetate products. Sugar catabolism hyperthermophiles involves non-phosphorylated versions Entner-Doudoroff pathway modified versions Embden-Meyerhof pathway. 'classical' Embden-Meyerhof pathway present hyperthermophilic Bacteria (Thermotoga) Archaea. hyperthermophiles (and Archaea) tested far utilize pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase acetyl-CoA formation pyruvate. Acetyl-CoA oxidation anaerobic sulphur-reducing aerobic hyperthermophiles proceeds via citric acid cycle; hyperthermophilic sulphate-reducer Archaeoglobus oxidative acetyl-CoA/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase pathway operative. Acetate formation acetyl-CoA Archaea, including hyperthermophiles, catalysed acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming), novel prokarvotic enzyme involved energy conservation. Bacteria, including hyperthermophile Thermotoga, acetyl-CoA conversion acetate involves two enzymes, phosphate acetyltransferase acetate kinase.
