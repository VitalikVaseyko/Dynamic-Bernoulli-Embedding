 Pyruvate kinase (PK) plays key role erythrocytes, obtain energy glycolysis. study investigated erythrocyte energy metabolism hypoxic newborns, measuring pyruvate kinase activity, kinetic, ATP levels hypoxia. Forty-nine babies cord pH value lower 7.2 Apgar scores lower 7 first minute accepted hypoxic group, 48 babies cord pH value higher 7.2 Apgar score higher 7 first minute taken controls. erythrocyte mean PK activity found lower (16.9+/-8.5 [5.8-47.9] EU/gHb) hypoxic group control group (21.3+/-10.9 [3.9-44.3] EU/gHb) (p<.05). mean ATP value hypoxic group higher (19.2+/-11.3 [3.9-37.6] mM) compared control group (13.8+/-7.16 [3.9-28.7] mM). kinetic study, different ADP concentrations control group, substrate amount (Km) needed reach half-maximum enzyme activity (Vmax=27.7 Eu/gHb) found 2.70 mM, 1.47 mM reach Vmax (22.7 Eu/gHb) hypoxic group. Vmax 41.67 Eu/gHb Km 8.33 mM control group different PEP concentrations, whereas Vmax 21.7 Eu/gHb Km 0.89 mM hypoxic group. Increase ATP level ePK activity decreases, suggesting glycolysis increases hypoxia. kinetic study, substrate amount needed reaching half-maximum enzyme activity less hypoxic group, probably suggests pyruvate kinase increases glycolysis increasing affinity substrates. way, erythrocytes may gain energy required oxygen delivery tissues maintaining ion gradient. arrangement possibly proceeds sygmoidal structure pyruvate kinase.
