 Significant quantitative differences end-product yields two strains Clostridium thermocellum one strain Thermoanaerobium brockii observed cellobiose fermentation. notably, ethanol/H(2) lactate/acetate ratios drastically higher T. brockii compared C. thermocellum strains LQRI AS39. Exogenous H(2) addition (0.4 1.0 atm) culture growth increased ethanol/acetate ratio T. brockii AS39 effect LQRI. strains operative Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway displayed catabolic activities fructose-1,6-diphosphate-activated lactate dehydrogenase, coenzyme acetylating pyruvate acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, ethanol dehydrogenase, acetate kinase. Enzyme kinetic properties (apparent K(m), V(max), Q(10) values) specificity electron donors/acceptors different oxidoreductases involved pyruvate conversion fermentation products compared three strains. species contained ferredoxin-linked pyruvate dehydrogenase pyridine nucleotide oxidoreductases. Ferredoxin-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) reductase activity significantly higher T. brockii AS39 detectable LQRI. H(2) production hydrogenase activity inversely related ferredoxin-NAD reductase activity three strains. Ferredoxin-NAD phosphate reductase activity present cell extracts species. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity C. thermocellum NAD dependent, unidirectional, inhibited low concentrations NAD ethanol. Ethanol dehydrogenase activity T. brockii NAD NADP linked, reversible, inhibited low levels reaction products. high lactate yield T. brockii correlated increased fructose-1,6-diphosphate. relation catabolic enzyme activity quantitative differences intracellular electron flow fermentation product yields thermophilic bacteria discussed.
