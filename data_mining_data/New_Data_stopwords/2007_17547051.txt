 conducted allozyme electrophoretic study explore potential enzyme markers distinguish Opisthorchis viverrini Thailand Lao PDR. Twenty-eight enzymes encoding presumptive 32 loci established. enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase diagnostic two geographically separate isolates Thailand. Twelve enzymes, ie, aconitate hydratase, aldolase, creatine kinase, enolase, esterases, fumarate hydratase, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose-phosphate isomerase, alanine aminotransferase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, also provided diagnostic markers two isolates Thailand one isolate Lao PDR.
