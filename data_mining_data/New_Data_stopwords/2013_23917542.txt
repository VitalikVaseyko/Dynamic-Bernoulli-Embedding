 Recently become clear cost associated Warburg effect, inefficient production ATP, offset selective advantages produced resultant intracellular metabolic alterations. fact tumors may addicted Warburg effect. addition alterations result changes extracellular tumor microenvironment also produce selective advantages tumor cell growth survival. One extracellular alteration increased adenosine concentrations shown impair cell mediated rejection support angiogenesis. expression A2A receptor non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) tissues, cell lines cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) determined performing immunohistrochemistry immunoblot analysis. efficacy A2A receptor antagonists vivo evaluated PC9 xenograft model. determine mode cell death induced A2A receptor antagonists flow cytometry, immunoblot, cytotoxic analysis performed. found significant number lung adenocarcinomas express adenosine A2A receptors. Antagonism receptors impaired CAF tumor cell growth vitro inhibited human tumor xenograft growth mice. observations add rationale testing adenosine A2A receptor antagonists anticancer therapeutics. could prevention negative signaling cells within tumor microenvironment inhibition angiogenesis, also inhibitory effect tumor-promoting, immunosuppressive CAFs direct inhibitory effect tumor cells themselves.
