 Infrared spectroscopy powerful tool protein science due sensitivity changes secondary structure conformation. order take advantage full power infrared spectroscopy structural studies proteins, complex band contours, amide band, decomposed main component bands, process referred curve fitting. paper, report improved curve fitting approach absorption spectra second derivative spectra fitted simultaneously. approach, name co-fitting, leads reliable modelling experimental data uses spectral information standard approach fitting absorption spectrum. also avoids fitting routine becomes trapped local minima. tested proposed approach using infrared absorption spectra three mixed alpha/beta proteins different degrees spectral overlap amide region: ribonuclease A, pyruvate kinase, aconitase.
