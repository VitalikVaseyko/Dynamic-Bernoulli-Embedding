 Warburg effect describes phenomenon cancer cells obtain energy glycolysis even normoxic (O(2)-sufficient) conditions. Tumor tissues generally exposed hypoxia owing inefficient aberrant vasculature. Cancer cells multiple molecular mechanisms adapt stress conditions reprogramming cellular metabolism. Hypoxia-inducible factors major transcription factors induced cancer cells response hypoxia contribute metabolic changes. addition, cancer cells within hypoxic tumor areas reduced access serum components nutrients lipids. However, effect serum factor deprivation cancer cell biology context tumor hypoxia fully understood. Cancer cells lipid-rich normoxia hypoxia, leading increased generation cellular organelle, lipid droplet (LD). recent years, LD-mediated stress response mechanisms cancer cells revealed. review focuses production functions LDs various types cancer cells relation associated cellular environment factors including tissue oxygenation status metabolic mechanisms. information contribute current understanding cancer cells adapt diverse tumor environments promote survival.
