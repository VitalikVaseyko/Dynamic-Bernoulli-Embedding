 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (RMPK) important allosteric enzyme glycolytic pathway catalyzing transfer phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP. energetic landscape allosteric regulatory mechanism RMPK characterized isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) temperature range 4 45 degrees C. ITC data RMPK binding substrates PEP ADP, allosteric inhibitor Phe, combination ADP Phe globally analyzed. thermodynamic parameters characterizing linked-multiple-equilibrium system extracted. Four novel insights uncovered. (1) binding preference ADP either R state temperature-dependent, namely, favorable R states high low temperatures, respectively. crossover affinity toward R states implies ADP plays complex role modulating allosteric behavior RMPK. Depending temperature, binding ADP regulate RMPK activity favoring enzyme either R state. (2) binding Phe negatively coupled ADP; i.e., Phe ADP prefer bind subunit RMPK. (3) release absorption protons linked various equilibria specific particular reaction. consequence, pH exert complex effect linked equilibria, resulting proton allosteric regulatory ligand RMPK. (4) R <--> equilibrium accompanied significant DeltaC(p), rendering RMPK sensitive temperature physiological conditions. muscle activity, pH temperature fluctuations known happen; thus, results study physiologically relevant.
