 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) oxidizes pyruvate acetyl CoA critically important maintaining normal cellular energy homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations PDC give rise congenital lactic acidosis progressive cellular energy failure. However, subsequent biochemical consequences PDC deficiency may contribute clinical manifestations disorder poorly understood. postulated altered flux PDC would disrupt mitochondrial electron transport, resulting oxidative stress. Compared cells 4 healthy subjects, primary cultures skin fibroblasts 9 patients variable mutations gene encoding alpha subunit (E1alpha) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDA1) demonstrated reduced growth viability. Superoxide (O(2)(.-)) Qo site complex III electron transport chain accumulated cells associated decreased activity manganese superoxide dismutase. expression uncoupling protein 2 also decreased patient cells, significant changes expression cellular markers protein DNA oxidative damage. expression hypoxia transcription factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha) also increased PDC deficient fibroblasts. conclude PDC deficiency associated increase O(2)(.-) accumulation coupled decrease mechanisms responsible removal. Increased HIF1alpha expression may contribute increase glycolytic flux lactate production PDC deficiency and, trans-activating pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, may suppress residual PDC activity phosphorylation E1alpha subunit.
