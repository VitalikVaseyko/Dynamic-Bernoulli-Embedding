 properties purified mammalian adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)- guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinases compared. Several physical characteristics two enzymes similar, including size, shape, affinity cyclic nucleotide binding, K(m) ATP. addition, amino acid composition two proteins indicated close composition homology (70-90%). cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases catalyzed phosphorylation rat liver pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) fructose 1,6-diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11), rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (EC 2.4.1.11) phosphorylase b kinase (EC 2.7.1.38), calf thymus histone H(2)b. phosphorylation several synthetic peptides trypsin-sensitive trypsin-insensitive sites glycogen synthase suggested similar recognition sites protein substrates two kinases. cAMP-dependent protein kinase better catalyst protein peptides substrate. results suggest two enzymes evolved common ancestral protein.
