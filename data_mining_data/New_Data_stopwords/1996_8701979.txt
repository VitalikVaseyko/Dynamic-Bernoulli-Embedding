 Liver damage induced variety agents including hepatocarcinogens, alcohol, virus induces proliferation oval cells. study, iron overloading liver used means inducing liver damage extended period ascertain whether promotes appearance oval cells. Rats fed 2% carbonyl-iron-supplemented diet 3 6 months. Extensive iron deposits appeared periportally hepatocytes Kupffer cells. Iron deposition less pronounced pericentrally. Small oval-like cells, morphologically immunocytochemically similar CDE-derived oval cells, identified quantified. first emerged periportally subsequently small tracts foci nearer central regions stained positively alpha-fetoprotein, pi-class glutathione S-transferase, embryonic form pyruvate kinase. contained iron deposits classified iron free. major difference CDE- iron-overload-derived oval cells latter negative transferrin. study shows cellular changes occurring iron-overloaded rat liver similar observed rats placed hepatocarcinogenic diet rats chronically exposed alcohol.
