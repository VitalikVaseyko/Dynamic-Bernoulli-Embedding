 CO2 stimulates development many intestinal helminths able fix CO2 means phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), Hysterothylacium aduncum. determined activity CO2-fixing enzymes PEPCK phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), although significant activity detected pyruvate carboxylase carboxylating-malic enzyme. former act phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) yield oxalacetate. helminths studied, PEP vital role glucidic metabolism. Consequently, determined activity enzymes involved crossroad PEP, pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase. enzymes detected showed significant variations activity vitro development parasite third larval stage mature adult. Fixing CO2 PEPCK decreased development (from 228 115 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein), PEPC increased (from 19 46 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein). enzyme, rare animals, could play part detecting levels free phosphate, releasing PEP required processes glycogenolysis, glycolysis adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. PK, showed increasing activity development immature adult (from 56 82 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein), could act combination PEPC obtain energy cytosol (in form ATP) mitochondria (possible destination pyruvate formed), compensating decrease activity PEPCK.
