 platelet-activating factor (PAF) produced mouse embryos showed similar kinetics action dose-response curve, bioassay, 1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphocholine (PAF-acether). activity embryo-derived PAF affected inhibitors ADP (pyruvate kinase phosphoenol pyruvate) cyclo-oxygenase (indomethacin) pathways platelet activation. Chlorpromazine, inhibitor PAF-acether pathway platelet activation, caused significant inhibition effects embryo-derived PAF. Phospholipases A2, C significantly inhibited activity lipase effect, suggesting phospholipid structure. embryo-derived PAF found chloroform fraction chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) extraction, PAF-acether. factors migrated similar rate (Rf 0.10-0.12) silica thin-layer chromatography (chloroform:methanol:water; 65:35:4 vol.). embryo-derived PAF therefore displays chemical, biochemical physiological properties similar PAF-acether.
