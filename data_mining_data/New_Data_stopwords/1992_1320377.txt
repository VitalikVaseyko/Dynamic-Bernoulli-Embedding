 effect treatment rats bacterial endotoxin fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) metabolism investigated isolated liver cells prepared 18 h-starved animals. results obtained support hypothesis stimulation 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) activity inhibition fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2ase) may one mechanism underlying inhibition gluconeogenesis lactate pyruvate endotoxin. suggest stimulation PFK-1 inhibition Fru-1,6-P2ase activity result 2-3-fold increase Fru-2,6-P2. latter due changes total activity phosphorylation state bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, appears result decrease cytosolic concentration phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), inhibitor PFK-2 activity. effect endotoxin resistant presence glucagon, comparable effects cells prepared control endotoxin-treated animals. mechanism endotoxin treatment rat decreases PEP gluconeogenesis remains established. However, involve alterations either total activity phosphorylation state pyruvate kinase, involve increased flux enzyme intact cell, fact decreased model septic shock. suggested decreased flux may result lower rate formation PEP, suggesting prime lesion sepsis inhibition one steps leading PEP formation.
