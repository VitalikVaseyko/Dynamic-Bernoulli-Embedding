 short-term training program involving 2 h daily exercise 59% peak O2 uptake (VO2max) repeated 10-12 consecutive days employed determine significance adaptations energy metabolic potential alterations energy metabolism substrate utilization working muscle. initial VO2max determined training eight male subjects 53.0 +/- 2.0 (SE) ml.kg-1.min-1. Analysis samples obtained needle biopsy vastus lateralis muscle exercise (0 min) 15, 60, 99 min exercise indicated average training resulted (P less 0.05) 6.5% higher concentration creatine phosphate, 9.9% lower concentration creatine, 39% lower concentration lactate. Training effect ATP concentration. adaptations also accompanied reduction utilization glycogen end exercise glycogen concentration 47.1% higher trained muscle. Analysis maximal activities representative enzymes different metabolic pathways segments indicated change potential citric acid cycle (succinate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase), beta-oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase), glucose phosphorylation (hexokinase), potential glycogenolysis (phosphorylase) glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase). exception increases capillary-to-fiber area ratio type IIa fibers, change found fiber type (types I, IIa, IIb) area, number capillaries, capillary-to-fiber area ratio, oxidative potential training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
