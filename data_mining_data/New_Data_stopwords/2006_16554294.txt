 Colorectal cancer second leading killer cancer worldwide presently common cancer among males Singapore. study aimed detect changes protein profiles associated process colorectal tumorigenesis identify specific protein markers early colorectal cancer detection diagnosis potential therapeutic targets. Seven pairs colorectal cancer tissues adjacent normal mucosa examined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis basic pH range (pH 7-10). Intensity changes 34 spots detected statistical significance. 16 34 spots identified MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. Changes protein expression levels revealed significantly enhanced glycolytic pathway (Warburg effect), decreased gluconeogenesis, suppressed glucuronic acid pathway, impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle. Observed changes protein abundance verified two-dimensional DIGE. changes reveal underlying mechanism colorectal tumorigenesis roles impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle Warburg effect may critical.
