 effect long-term oral synthetic protease inhibitor (FOY 305) administration fasting blood sugar (FBS), body weight, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin glucagon levels, pancreatic insulin glucagon contents, hepatic enzyme activities, plasma lipids normal streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats studied. Normal rats treated oral FOY 305 9 weeks found pancreatic hypertrophy decreased body weight gain compared untreated normal controls. FBS, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin glucagon levels, pancreatic insulin glucagon contents, plasma lipids uninfluenced FOY 305 treated normal rats. STZ-induced diabetic rats treated oral FOY 305 found decreased FBS 5 weeks beginning FOY 305 administration compared untreated diabetic controls, whereas 7th 9th week treatment difference FBS FOY 305 treated untreated diabetic rats. metabolic balance observed 4th week treatment, slight improvement diabetic state found FOY 305 treated diabetic rats. apparent difference blood sugar curve insulin response following oral glucose load diabetic rats treated 7 weeks untreated diabetic rats. rats sacrificed 9 weeks treatment. Diabetic rats treated oral FOY 305 9 weeks showed pancreatic hypertrophy decreased plasma glucagon level decreased pancreatic glucagon content compared untreated diabetic controls, whereas difference body weight, plasma insulin level pancreatic insulin content FOY 305 treated untreated diabetic rats. Furthermore, oral FOY 305 treatment improved hyperlipidemia STZ-induced diabetic rats also significantly improved hepatic pyruvate kinase phosphoenlpyruvate carboxykinase activities diabetic rats. improvements might partly due decreased pancreatic content secretion glucagon and/or direct action synthetic PI, FOY 305 tissues.
