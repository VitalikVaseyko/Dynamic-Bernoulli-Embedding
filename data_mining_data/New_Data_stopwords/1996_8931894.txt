 present paper, vitro activities 10 osmium(III) complexes [OSIII(L)] degrees structure promastigote forms Leishmania donovani epimastigote forms Trypanosoma cruzi assayed. complexes OSIII-2,4dinitroimidazole dithiocarbamate, OSIII-4-nitroimidazole dithiocarbamate, OSIII-benznidazole dithiocarbamate OSIII-2-amino-6-Br-benzothiazole dithiocarbamate induced high percentages growth inhibition parasites. four compounds showed moderate cell toxicity. inhibitory effects complexes macromolecule synthesis evaluated using [3H]-thymidine, [3H]-uridine [3H]-leucine incorporation. metal-drug complexes clearly inhibit DNA, RNA protein synthesis, well enzymatic activities succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase.
