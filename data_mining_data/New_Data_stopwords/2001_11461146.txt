 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae efficiently ferments hexose sugars ethanol, unable utilize xylose, pentose sugar abundant lignocellulosic materials. Recombinant strains containing genes coding xylose reductase (XR) xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) xylose-utilizing yeast Pichia stipitis reported; however, strains ferment xylose ethanol poorly. One reason may low capacity xylulokinase, third enzyme xylose pathway. investigate potential limitation xylulokinase step, overexpressed endogenous gene enzyme (XKS1) S. cerevisiae also expresses P. stipitis genes XR XDH. metabolism recombinant yeast investigated pure xylose bioreactor cultivation various oxygen levels. results clearly indicated overexpression XKS1 significantly enhances specific rate xylose utilization. addition, XK-overexpressing strain efficiently convert xylose ethanol aeration conditions studied. One important illustrations significant anaerobic aerobic xylose conversion ethanol recombinant Saccharomyces; moreover, achieved pure xylose carbon. microaerobic conditions, 5.4 g L(-1) ethanol produced 47 g L(-1) xylose 100 h. fed-batch cultivations using mixture xylose glucose carbon sources, specific ethanol production rate highest highest aeration rate tested declined almost one order magnitude lower aeration levels. Intracellular metabolite analyses vitro enzyme activities suggest following: control flux strain overexpresses XKS1 shifted nonoxidative steps pentose phosphate pathway (i.e., downstream xylose 5-phosphate), enzymatic steps lower part glycolysis ethanol formation pathways (pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase) high flux control recombinant strain. Furthermore, intracellular ATP levels found significantly lower XK strain compared either control strain similar conditions glucose-grown Saccharomyces. ATP : ADP ratios also lower XK strain, especially microaerobic conditions (0.9 vs 6.4).
