 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy powerful versatile tool investigate structure dynamics proteins solution. intrinsically low extinction coefficient amide mode, main structure-related oscillator, together high infrared absorptivity aqueous media, requires proteins studied high concentrations (>10 mg L(-1)). may represent challenge study aggregation-prone proteins peptides, questions significance structural data obtained proteins physiologically existing much lower concentrations. describe development simple experimental approach increases detection limit protein structure analysis infrared spectroscopy. approach relies custom-made filters isolate amide region (1700-1600 cm(-1)) irrelevant spectral regions. sensitivity instrument increased background attenuation, approach consisting use neutral density filter, non-scattering metal grid, attentuate intensity background spectrum. filters grid combined, 2.4-fold improvement noise level obtained. successfully tested approach using highly diluted solution pyruvate kinase deuterated medium (0.2% w/v), found provides spectra quality comparable recorded 10-fold higher protein concentration.
