 Changes muscle proteins serum exercise studied evaluate use proteins indicators increased muscle membrane vulnerability. Seventy-one women asked perform bicycle exercise 45 min moderate load; four proteins (creatine kinase - CK, myoglobin - Mb, aldolase - Ald pyruvate kinase - PK) measured serum 24 h exercise. Twenty-one women carriers Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD); known show elevated serum CK activity rest, well increased CK response exercise. Fifty women without family history neuromuscular disease tested obtain normal values: showed small peak (18%) CK activity 8 h exercise, even smaller peak Mb (9%) 1 h exercise. mean post-exercise increase CK Mb 21 DMD carriers significantly higher controls; maximum Mb, average 70% baseline levels, reached 1 h exercise higher CK (48%), reached 8 h exercise. concluded myoglobin levels exercise good index increased vulnerability muscle membrane.
