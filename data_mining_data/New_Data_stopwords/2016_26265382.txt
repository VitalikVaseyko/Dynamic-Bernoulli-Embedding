 BACKGROUND: Stroke major cause disability death adults. Diabetes mellitus metabolic disorder strongly increases risk severe vascular diseases. study compared changes proteins cerebral cortex ischemic brain injury nondiabetic diabetic animals. METHODS: Adult male rats injected streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal route induce diabetes underwent surgical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 4 wk streptozotocin treatment. Cerebral cortex tissues collected 24 h MCAO cerebral cortex proteins analyzed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Several proteins identified differentially expressed nondiabetic diabetic animals. Among identified proteins, focused following metabolism-related enzymes: isocitrate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenosylhomocysteinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (neuroleukin). Expression proteins decreased animals underwent MCAO. Moreover, protein expression reduced greater extent diabetic animals nondiabetic animals. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed diabetic condition exacerbates decrease expression metabolism-related proteins MCAO. CONCLUSIONS: results suggest diabetic condition may exacerbate brain damage focal cerebral ischemia downregulation metabolism-related proteins.
