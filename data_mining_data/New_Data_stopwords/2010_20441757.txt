 Structural changes rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) induced phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) Mg(2+) binding studied attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combination dialysis accessory. experiments indicated largely preserved secondary structure upon PEP Mg(2+) binding also revealed small backbone conformational changes PK involving types secondary structure. assess effect protein environment bound PEP, assigned evaluated infrared absorption bands bound PEP. identified using 2,3-(13)C(2)-labeled PEP. obtained following assignments: 1589 cm(-1) (antisymmetric carboxylate stretching vibration); 1415 cm(-1) (symmetric carboxylate stretching vibration); 1214 cm(-1) (C-O stretching vibration); 1124 1110 cm(-1) (asymmetric PO(3)(2-) stretching vibrations); 967 cm(-1) (symmetric PO(3)(2-) stretching vibration). corresponding band positions solution 1567, 1407, 1229, 1107, 974 cm(-1). differences bound free PEP indicate specific interactions ligand protein. Quantification interactions phosphate group indicated enzyme environment little influence P-O bond strengths, bridging P-O bond, broken catalytic reaction, weakened <3%. Thus, little distortion toward dissociative transition state phosphate transfer reaction PEP binds PK. Therefore, results line associative transition state. Carboxylate absorption bands indicated maximal shortening length shorter C-O bond 1.3 pm. PEP bound PK presence monovalent ion Na(+) exhibited band positions presence K(+), indicating similar interaction strengths ligand protein cases.
