 Previously shown hypoxia strongly induces expression 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 -4 (PFKFB-3 PFKFB-4) genes several cancer cell lines via HIF-dependent mechanism. paper studied expression hypoxic regulation PFKFB-4 PFKFB-3 mRNA well correlation HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, VEGF Glut1 mRNA expression pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1 two gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 NUGC3. study clearly demonstrated PFKFB-3 PFKFB-4 mRNA expresses MKN45, NUGC3 Panc1 cancers cells genes responsive hypoxia vitro. However, basal level expression hypoxia responsiveness vary different cells studied. Particularly, PFKFB-3 mRNA highly expressed MKN45 NUGC3 cancer cells, highest response hypoxia NUGC3 cell line. PFKFB-4 mRNA variable low basal level expression gastric pancreatic cancer cell lines. However, highest hypoxia response PFKFB-4 mRNA found pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1. basal level PFKFB-4 protein expression highest NUGC3 gastric cancer cell line lowest Panc1 cells, highest response hypoxia pancreatic cancer cell line. studies showed PFKFB-3 PFKFB-4 gene expression highly responsive hypoxia mimic dimethyloxalylglycine, specific inhibitor HIF-alpha hydroxylase enzymes, suggesting hypoxia responsiveness PFKFB-3 PFKFB-4 genes cell lines regulated HIF transcription complex. expression VEGF Glut1, known HIF-dependent genes, also strongly induced hypoxic conditions gastric pancreatic cancer cell lines. levels HIF-1alpha protein increased gastric pancreatic cancer cell lines hypoxic conditions. However, basal level HIF-1alpha well HIF-2alpha mRNA expression hypoxia responsiveness different MKN45 NUGC3 cancer cells. Thus, expression HIF-1alpha mRNA decreased gastric cancer cell lines treated hypoxia dimethyloxalylglycine, HIF-2alpha mRNA expression changed significantly NUGC3 slightly increased MKN45 cells. Expression PFKFB-4 PFKFB-3 also studied gastric cancers corresponding nonmalignant tissue counterparts patients mRNA protein levels. expression PFKFB-3 PFKFB-4 mRNA well PFKFB-1 PFKFB-2 mRNA observed normal human gastric tissue increased malignant gastric tumors. basal level PFKFB-4 protein expression gastric cancers much higher compared PFKFB-3 isoenzyme. conclusion, study provides evidence PFKFB-4 PFKFB-3 genes also expressed gastric pancreatic cancer cells, strongly respond hypoxia via HIF-1alpha dependent mechanism and, together expression PFKFB-1 PFKFB-2 genes, possibly significant role Warburg effect found malignant cells.
