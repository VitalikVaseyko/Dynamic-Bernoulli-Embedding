 chapter, demonstrate advantage simultaneous multicurve nonlinear least-squares analysis conventional single-curve analysis. Fitting results subjected thorough Monte Carlo analysis rigorous assessment confidence intervals parameter correlations. comparison performed practical example simulated steady-state reaction kinetics complemented isothermal calorimetry (ITC) data resembling allosteric behavior rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (RMPK). Global analysis improves accuracy confidence limits model parameters. Cross-correlation parameters also reduced accompanying enhancement model-testing power. becomes especially important validation models "difficult" highly cross-correlated parameters. show proper experimental design critical evaluation data improve chance differentiating models.
