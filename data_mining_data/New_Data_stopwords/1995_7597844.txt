 Growth efficiency regulation key enzyme activities studied carbon- energy-limited chemostat cultures Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown mixtures glucose ethanol fixed dilution rate. Biomass yields substrate carbon oxygen could adequately described net result growth single substrates. Activities isocitrate lyase malate synthase detected cell-free extracts glucose-limited cultures. However, enzymes present ethanol fraction reservoir medium exceeded theoretical minimum glyoxylate cycle required anabolic reactions. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity detectable high ethanol fractions feed, activity enzyme required synthesis hexose phosphates. Phospho-enol-pyruvate-carboxykinase activity detectable extracts glucose-grown cultures increased ethanol fraction feed. concluded that, carbon-limited growth S. cerevisiae mixtures glucose ethanol, biosynthetic intermediates three carbon atoms preferentially synthesized glucose. Synthesis key enzymes gluconeogenesis glyoxylate cycle adapted cells' requirement intermediates. gluconeogenic enzymes physiological antagonists (pyruvate kinase, pyruvate carboxylase phosphofructokinase) expressed simultaneously high ethanol fractions feed. futile cycling prevented conditions, primarily achieved tight control enzyme synthesis.
