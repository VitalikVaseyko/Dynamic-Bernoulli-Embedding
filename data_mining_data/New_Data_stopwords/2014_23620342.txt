 beta-Alanine beta-amino acid derivative degradation pyrimidine uracil precursor oxidative substrate acetyl-coenzyme (acetyl-CoA). accumulation beta-alanine occurs beta-alaninemia, inborn error metabolism. Patients beta-alaninemia may develop neurological abnormalities whose mechanisms far understood. study evaluated effects beta-alanine administration parameters oxidative stress creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase cerebral cortex cerebellum 21-day-old rats. animals received three peritoneal injections beta-alanine (0.3 mg /g body weight) controls received volume (10 muL/g body weight) saline solution (NaCl 0.85 %) 3 h intervals. CSF levels beta-alanine increased five times, achieving 80 muM rats receiving amino acid. results beta-alanine administration parameters oxidative stress similar tissues studied: reduction superoxide dismutase activity, increased oxidation 2',7'-dihydrodichlorofluorescein, total content sulfhydryl catalase activity. However, results phosphoryltransfer network enzymes similar enzymes, different tissues studied: beta-alanine administration able inhibit enzyme pyruvate kinase, cytosolic creatine kinase, adenylate kinase activities cerebral cortex, increase cerebellum. case also occurs patients, results suggest oxidative stress alteration phosphoryltransfer network may involved pathophysiology beta-alaninemia. Moreover, ingestion beta-alanine improve muscular performance deserves attention respect possible side-effects.
