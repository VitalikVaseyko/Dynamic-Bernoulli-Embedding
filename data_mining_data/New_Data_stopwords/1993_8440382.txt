 produced three lines transgenic mice containing 5' flanking region L-type pyruvate kinase gene nucleotides -189 +37, includes enhancer unit TATA box functional elements, linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Since transgene expression stimulated dietary fructose glucose tissue-dependent manner, suggest unit responsive stimuli.
