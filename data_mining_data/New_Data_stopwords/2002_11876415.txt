 Classical whole-cell mutagenesis achieved great success development many industrial fermentation strains, serious disadvantage accumulation uncharacterized secondary mutations detrimental performance. post-genomic era, novel methodology avoids drawback presents itself. "genome-based strain reconstruction" involves identifying mutations comparative genomic analysis, defining mutations beneficial production, assembling single wild-type background. Described herein initial challenge involving reconstruction classically derived L-lysine-producing Corynebacterium glutamicum. Comparative genomic analysis relevant terminal pathways, efflux step, anaplerotic reactions wild-type production strains identified Val-59-->Ala mutation homoserine dehydrogenase gene (hom), Thr-311-->Ile mutation aspartokinase gene (lysC), Pro-458-->Ser mutation pyruvate carboxylase gene (pyc). Introduction hom lysC mutations wild-type strain allelic replacement resulted accumulation 8 g 55 g L-lysine/l, respectively, indicating specific mutations relevant production. two mutations reconstituted wild-type genome, led synergistic effect production (75 g/l). introduction pyc mutation resulted additional contribution accumulation 80 g/l 27 h. high-speed fermentation achieved highest productivity (3.0 g l(-1) h(-1)) far reported microbes producing L-lysine fed-batch fermentation.
