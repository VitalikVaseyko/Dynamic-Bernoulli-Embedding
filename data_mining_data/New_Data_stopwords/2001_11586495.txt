 Rates glucose uptake epididymal retroperitoneal adipose tissue vivo, well rates hexose uptake glycolytic flux isolated adipocytes, determined rats adapted high-protein, carbohydrate-free (HP) diet control rats fed balanced (N) diet. Adaptation HP diet induced significant reduction rates glucose uptake, estimated 2-deoxy-[1-(3)H]-glucose, adipose tissue (epididymal retroperitoneal) vivo isolated adipocytes. Twelve hours replacement HP diet balanced diet, rates adipose tissue uptake vivo HP-adapted rats returned levels differ significantly N-fed rats. rate flux glycolytic pathway, estimated (3)H[5]-glucose, also significantly reduced adipocytes HP-fed rats. agreement findings, activities hexokinase (HK), phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), pyruvate kinase (PK) markedly reduced adipose tissue HP-adapted rats. activity pyruvate kinase partially reverted diet replacement 12 hours. low-plasma insulin high-glucagon levels HP-fed rats may played important role reduction adipose tissue glucose utilization animals.
