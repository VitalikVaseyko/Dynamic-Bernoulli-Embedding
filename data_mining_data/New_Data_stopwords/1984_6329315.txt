 electrophoretic method devised investigate changes enzymes isoenzymes carbohydrate metabolism, upon adding glucose derepressed yeast cells. (i) glycolytic enzymes tested, enolase II, pyruvate kinase pyruvate decarboxylase markedly increased. increase accompanied overall increase glycolytic activity prevented cycloheximide, inhibitor protein synthesis. (ii) contrast, respiratory activity decreased adding glucose. decrease clearly shown result repression respiratory enzymes. rapid decrease within minutes adding glucose, analogy so-called ' Crabtree effect', observed yeast. (iii) gluconeogenic enzymes, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase malate dehydrogenase, inactivated adding glucose, showed significant changes electrophoretic mobilities. Hence, evidence enzyme modifications, postulated initiating degradation. However, possible investigate cytoplasmic mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase isoenzymes separately. Synthesis mitochondrial isoenzyme repressed, whereas cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase subject glucose inactivation.
