 specificity histone-H4-specific, protease-activated protein kinase (H4-PK) examined using two series synthetic peptides corresponding phosphorylation sites histone H4 pyruvate kinase. Optimum kinetic constants phosphorylation observed using peptide Val-Lys-Arg-Ile-Ser-Gly-Leu. Peptides Lys replaced Arg Lys-Arg sequence transposed phosphorylated less favorable kinetics. Peptides either basic residue deleted serve substrates. H4 peptide, containing Arg-Arg sequence, phosphorylated cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (CA-PK). Distinct specificity determinants H4-PK CA-PK also observed using pyruvate kinase peptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly). Collectively data indicated primary substrate specificity determinants H4-PK Lys-Arg-Xaa-Ser whereas CA-PK selectively phosphorylates sequence Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser.
