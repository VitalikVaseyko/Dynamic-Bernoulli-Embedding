 study utilized phosphorylase b kinase-deficient (gsd/gsd) rat model hepatic substrate utilization constraint glycogenesis imposed maintenance high glycogen concentrations. Glucose re-feeding 48 h-starved gsd/gsd rats led suppression hepatic glucose output. contrast situation normal rats, activation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex lipogenesis observed. suggested impeding glycogenic flux may divert substrate lipogenesis, possibly via activation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
