 BTG3 (B-cell translocation gene 3) p53 target also binds inhibits E2F1. Although connects two major growth-regulatory pathways functionally downregulated human cancers, whether BTG3 acts tumor suppressor remain largely uncharacterized. present evidence BTG3 binds suppresses AKT, kinase frequently deregulated cancers. BTG3 ablation results increased AKT activity phosphorylates inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. Consequently, also observed elevated beta-catenin/T-cell factor activity, upregulation mesenchymal markers, enhanced cell migration. Consistent findings, BTG3 overexpression suppressed tumor growth mouse xenografts, associated diminished AKT phosphorylation reduced beta-catenin tissue specimens. Significantly, short BTG3-derived peptide identified, recapitulates effects vitro cells. Thus, study provides mechanistic insights previously unreported AKT inhibitory pathway downstream p53. identification AKT inhibitory peptide also unveils new avenue cancer therapeutics development.
