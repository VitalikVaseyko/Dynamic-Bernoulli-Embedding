 Abnormal expression claudin subtypes reported various cancers. However, pathological role claudin clarified detail. Claudin-18 absent human non-small cell small cell lung cancers, although expressed normal lung tissues. Here, examined effect claudin-18 expression expression junctional proteins, cell proliferation, cell motility using human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Real-time PCR western blotting showed exogenous expression claudin-18 effect expression junctional proteins including claudin-1, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, E-cadherin. Claudin-18 mainly distributed cell-cell contact areas concomitant ZO-1. Cell proliferation significantly decreased 48 72h seeding claudin 18-expressing cells. Claudin-18 suppressed cell motility, whereas increased cell death anoikis. Claudin-18 decreased phosphorylated (p)-3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) p-Akt levels without affecting p-epidermal growth factor receptor p-phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) levels. Furthermore, claudin-18 bound PDK1 suppressed nuclear localization PDK1. suggest claudin-18 suppresses abnormal proliferation motility lung epithelial cells mediated inhibition PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling pathway.
