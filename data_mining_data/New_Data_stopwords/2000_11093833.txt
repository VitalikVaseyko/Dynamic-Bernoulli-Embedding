 introns-early view challenged several genes; prominent instances triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), aldolase, pyruvate kinase (PK), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) myosin heavy chain. introns appear phylogenetically ancient and/or delineate exons corresponding protein modules, considerable number seemingly not. argued many anomalous introns periodic, is, relics internal sequence repetitions within ancestral gene. periodic-intron patterns shared related genes, alphabeta -barrels TPI, aldolase PK, Rossmann nucleotide-binding domain common PK, ADH GAPDH. evidence ancestral status introns. myosin heavy chain C-terminal rod region paradoxical sequence clearly periodic intron placements not; however, exhibit remarkable coherence intron translational phases, suggesting introns may also originally periodic arrangement obscured intron slipping.
