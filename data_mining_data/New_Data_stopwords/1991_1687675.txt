 1. Withdrawal food lactating rats produced rapid dramatic decrease uptake glucose mammary gland inhibition rate fatty acid synthesis could explained alone decreased substrate supply tissue. 2. Within first 6 hr starvation, fatty acid synthesis pyruvate dehydrogenase activity inhibited 87 80%, respectively, acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity change significantly. 3. 6 24 hr starvation, total expressed activities acetyl-CoA carboxylase decreased 62 55%, respectively. 4. ratio fructose-6-phosphate/fructose-1,6-bisphosphate concentration mammary tissue increased 9-fold first 6 hr starvation, indicating inhibition 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. However, major inhibition enzyme occurred 6 24 hr starvation metabolite ratio increased 160-fold parallel increased tissue citrate concentration. 5. increase citrate concentration 6 24 hr starvation correlated acetyl-CoA carboxylase inactivation ketone body accumulation mammary gland. 6. study confirms asynchronous control three important regulatory steps pathway glucose utilization fatty acid synthesis lactating rat mammary gland.
