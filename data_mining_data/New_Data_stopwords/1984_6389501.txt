 Li+ inhibited growth Escherichia coli glucose, galactose, fructose, glycerol added sole source carbon. Growth inhibition observed lactate mixture amino acids used carbon source. mutant possessing elevated activity Li+ extrusion inhibited Li+. results suggested intracellular Li+ inhibited glycolytic pathway, likely triose metabolism, without affecting gluconeogenesis. also found pyruvate kinase inhibited Li+.
