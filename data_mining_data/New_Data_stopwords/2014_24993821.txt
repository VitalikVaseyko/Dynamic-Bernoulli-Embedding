 Rapid tumor growth establish metabolically stressed microenvironments activate 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), ubiquitous regulator ATP homeostasis. Previously, investigated importance AMPK growth experimental tumors prepared HRAS-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts primary brain tumor development rat model neurocarcinogenesis. Here, used triple-negative human breast cancer cells AMPK activity knocked investigate contribution AMPK experimental tumor growth core glucose metabolism. found AMPK supports growth fast-growing orthotopic tumors prepared MDA-MB-231 DU4475 breast cancer cells effect proliferation survival cells culture. used vitro vivo metabolic profiling [(13)C]glucose tracers investigate contribution AMPK core glucose metabolism MDA-MB-231 cells, Warburg metabolic phenotype; experiments indicated AMPK supports tumor glucose metabolism part positive regulation glycolysis nonoxidative pentose phosphate cycle. also found AMPK activity MDA-MB-231 tumors could systemically perturb glucose homeostasis sensitive normal tissues (liver pancreas). Overall, findings suggest contribution AMPK growth aggressive experimental tumors critical microenvironmental component involves specific regulation core glucose metabolism.
