 pyruvate kinase enzymopathies described red blood cells. basis results special structural properties erythrocyte PK assumed, yet totally established. PK defects may cause nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. enzymopathy characterized polymorphism, expressed 5 different pathological variants. 16 cases PK deficiency ben diagnozed GDR. following parameters used characterization PK: PEP-dependance, inhibition ATP alanine, specificity nucleotides, stability temperature urea maturation dependence. Two pathological variants PK decreased PEP-affinity described. Furthermore differences energy metabolism red blood cells two patients aerobic anaerobic conditions discussed.
