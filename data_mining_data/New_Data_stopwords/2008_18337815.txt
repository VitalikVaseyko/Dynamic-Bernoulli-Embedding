 Growth factors stimulate cells take excess nutrients use anabolic processes. biochemical mechanism accomplished fully understood initiated phosphorylation signalling proteins tyrosine residues. Using novel proteomic screen phosphotyrosine-binding proteins, made observation enzyme involved glycolysis, human M2 (fetal) isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), binds directly selectively tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. show binding phosphotyrosine peptides PKM2 results release allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, leading inhibition PKM2 enzymatic activity. also provide evidence regulation PKM2 phosphotyrosine signalling diverts glucose metabolites energy production anabolic processes cells stimulated certain growth factors. Collectively, results indicate expression phosphotyrosine-binding form pyruvate kinase critical rapid growth cancer cells.
