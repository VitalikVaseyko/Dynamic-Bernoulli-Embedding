 paper demonstrate, first time, feasibility new imaging concept - combined hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) (18)F-FDG-PET imaging. procedure performed clinical PET/MRI scanner canine cancer patient. named concept hyper PET. Intravenous injection hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate results increase (13)C-lactate, (13)C-alanine (13)C-CO2 ((13)C-HCO3) resonance peaks relative tissue, disease metabolic state probed. Accordingly, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) use (13)C-pyruvate possible directly study Warburg Effect rate conversion (13)C-pyruvate (13)C-lactate. study, combined (18)F-FDG-PET studies uptake glucose cells. canine cancer patient histology verified local recurrence liposarcoma right forepaw imaged using combined PET/MR clinical scanner. PET performed single-bed, 10 min acquisition, 107 min post injection 310 MBq (18)F-FDG. (13)C-chemical shift imaging (CSI) performed FDG-PET 30 post injection 23 mL hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate. Peak heights (13)C-pyruvate (13)C-lactate quantified using general linear model. Anatomic (1)H-MRI included axial coronal T1 vibe, coronal T2-tse axial T1-tse fat saturation following gadolinium injection. tumor found clearly increased (13)C-lactate production, also corresponded high (18)F-FDG uptake PET. agreement fact glycolysis production lactate increased tumor cells compared normal cells. Yet, interestingly, also muscle forepaw dog high (18)F-FDG uptake observed. due activity muscles prior anesthesia, accompanied similarly high (13)C-lactate production. Accordingly, clearly demonstrates Warburg Effect directly demonstrated hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate MRSI. possible (18)F-FDG-PET imaging due inability discriminate causes increased glucose uptake. propose new concept simultaneous hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate MRSI PET may highly valuable image-based non-invasive phenotyping tumors. methods may useful treatment planning therapy monitoring.
