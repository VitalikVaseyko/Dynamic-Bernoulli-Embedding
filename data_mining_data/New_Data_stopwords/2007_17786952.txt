 Sugar consumption subsequent sugar metabolism known regulate expression genes involved intestinal sugar absorption delivery. investigate hypothesis sugar-sensing detectors membranes facing intestinal lumen bloodstream also modulate intestinal sugar absorption. used wild-type GLUT2-null mice, show dietary sugars stimulate expression sucrase-isomaltase (SI) L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) GLUT2-dependent mechanisms, whereas expression GLUT5 SGLT1, rely presence GLUT2. providing sugar metabolites, sugar transporters, including GLUT2, fuelled sensing pathway. Caco2/TC7 enterocytes, could disconnect sensing triggered detector produced metabolism, found GLUT2 generated metabolism-independent pathway stimulate expression SI L-PK. cultured enterocytes, apical basolateral fructose could increase expression GLUT5, conversely, basolateral sugar administration could stimulate expression GLUT2. Finally, located sweet-taste receptors T1R3 T1R2 plasma membranes, measured cognate G alpha Gustducin mRNA levels. Furthermore, showed T1R3 inhibitor altered fructose-induced expression SGLT1, GLUT5, L-PK. Intestinal gene expression thus controlled combination least three sugar-signaling pathways triggered sugar metabolites membrane sugar receptors that, according membrane location, determine sugar-sensing polarity. provides rationale intestine adapts sugar delivery blood dietary sugar provision.
