 crystal structure muconate lactonizing enzyme solved 3 resolution, unambiguous alpha-carbon backbone chain trace made. enzyme contains three domains; central domain parallel-stranded alpha-beta barrel, previously reported six enzymes, including triose phosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase. One novel feature enzyme alpha-beta barrel seven parallel alpha-helices around central core eight parallel beta-strands; known alpha-beta barrels contain eight helices. N-terminal (alpha + beta) C-terminal domains cover cleft eighth helix would be. active site muconate lactonizing enzyme found locating manganese ion essential catalytic activity, binding locating inhibitor, alpha-ketoglutarate. active site lies cleft N-terminal barrel domains; active sites muconate lactonizing enzyme triose phosphate isomerase superimposed, barrel-strand 1 triose phosphate isomerase aligned barrel-strand 3 muconate lactonizing enzyme. implies structurally homologous active-site residues two enzymes carried different parts primary sequence; ancestral gene would transposed evolution modern proteins, seems unlikely. Therefore, two enzymes may related convergent, rather divergent, evolution.
