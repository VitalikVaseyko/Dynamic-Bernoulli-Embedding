 Preneoplastic liver lesions produced female Wistar rats oral administration 2-acetylaminofluorene 165 days succeeded carcinogen-free standard diet 420 days. treatment numerous altered hepatic foci (AHF) hyperplastic nodules (HN) detected histochemically focal decrease lack adenosine-5-triphosphatase glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) activities. addition, immunohistochemically demonstrable amount L-type pyruvate kinase clearly reduced. histochemically demonstrated decrease G-6-Pase substantiated microbiochemical determination enzyme activity microdissected material. Moreover, experimental period continuous decrease glucokinase increase hexokinase detected microbiochemically within AHF HN. alterations indicate shift carbohydrate metabolism gluconeogenesis glucose utilization pentose-phosphate-pathway biosynthesis nucleic acids. Beside oncofetal markers, HK may used indicator early stages liver carcinogenesis.
