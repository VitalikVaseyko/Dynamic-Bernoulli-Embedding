 Two enzymatic assay procedures measurement 2,5-anhydrohexitol fructose analogs devised. procedures based measurement ADP formed enzymatic phosphorylation analogs either hexokinase fructokinase. actual measurement makes use coupled assay system using pyruvate kinase, PEP, lactate dehydrogenase, NADH. systems used measure fructose appropriate analogs cuvette concentrations 0.10 mM. hexokinase procedures allows measurement fructose, 2,5-anhydromannitol, 2,5-anhydromannose. Glucose, also reacts, removed pretreatment samples glucose oxidase. fructokinase procedure allows measurement fructose, 2,5-anhydromannitol, 2,5-anhydroglucitol, 2,5-anhydrotalitol.
