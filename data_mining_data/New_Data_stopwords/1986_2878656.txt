 cell-free system prepared rat liver containing cytosol mitochondria well number cofactors gluconeogenic intermediates near-physiological concentrations shown form hexose 6-phosphates linearly lactate + pyruvate + glutamate rate 0.82 +/- 0.05 mumol/min per g liver (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 8, 37 degrees C). indicated rates measured 20 min 60 min incubation time, system near steady state. Experiments either [1-14C]lactate [U-14C]glutamate revealed incorporation radioactive label hexose 6-phosphates proportional utilization lactate + pyruvate glutamate incubation served gluconeogenic substrates ratio 2:1. [ATP]/[ADP] ratio lowered 60 19 addition ATPase, rate hexose 6-phosphate formation fell one-third. decrease gluconeogenic flux mainly due decreased flow phosphoglycerate kinase step. Hexose 6-phosphate formation could also decreased increasing ratio [NADH]/[NAD+], either addition ethanol increasing initial concentration lactate + pyruvate fixed ratio 10:1. observed inhibition linked limitation availability oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction increased formation sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Finally, rates hexose 6-phosphate formation incubations cytosols fed rats 50% observed cytosols animals starved 48 h. One limiting steps found flow phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase step.
