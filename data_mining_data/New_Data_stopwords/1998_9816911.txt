 Histopathological features Alzheimer's disease (AD) include extracellular deposits amyloid beta (A beta) fibrils cores senile plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed paired helical filaments (PHF), neuronal cell loss. main component PHF highly phosphorylated tau protein. identified protein kinase converting normal tau PHF-like state. kinase tau protein kinase (TPK) I/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 beta. Using neuronal cell culture system AD model, recognized TPK I/GSK-3 beta plays central role AD pathology. hypothesize beta-induced neuronal cell death occurs following mechanism. beta inactivates PI3-kinase activates TPK I/GSK-3 beta, turn phosphorylates inactivates tau pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). ability tau promote microtubule assembly diminished phosphorylation, soluble tau molecules aggregate PHF unknown mechanism. Destabilization microtubule arrays causes inhibition axonal transport accumulation amyloid precursor protein (APP). Phosphorylation PDH inhibits reaction converting pyruvate acetyl-CoA, resulting inhibition energy metabolism decrease acetylcholine, also characteristics AD. changes may lead neuronal cell death.
