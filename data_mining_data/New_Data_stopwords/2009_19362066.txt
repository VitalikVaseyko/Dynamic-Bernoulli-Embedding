 main focus investigation steady state kinetics regulation mitochondrial respiration permeabilized cardiomyocytes situ. Complete kinetic analysis regulation respiration mitochondrial creatine kinase performed presence pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate simulate interaction mitochondria glycolytic enzymes. system analysis revealed striking differences kinetic behaviour MtCK-activated mitochondrial respiration situ vitro. Apparent dissociation constants MgATP binary ternary complexes MtCK, Kia Ka (1.94+/-0.86 mM 2.04+/-0.14 mM, correspondingly) increased several orders magnitude situ comparison constants vitro (0.44+/-0.08 mM 0.016+/-0.01 mM, respectively). Apparent dissociation constants creatine, Kib Kb (2.12+/-0.21 mM 2.17+/-0.40 Mm, correspondingly) significantly decreased situ comparison vitro mitochondria (28+/-7 mM 5+/-1.2 mM, respectively). Dissociation constant phosphocreatine changed. data may indicate selective restriction metabolites' diffusion level mitochondrial outer membrane. concluded mechanisms regulation respiration energy fluxes vivo system level properties depend intracellular interactions mitochondria cytoskeleton, intracellular MgATPases cytoplasmic glycolytic system.
