 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exhibits high dietary amino acid requirements apparent inefficiency use dietary carbohydrates. Using species, investigated metabolic consequences long-term high carbohydrates/low protein feeding. Fish fed two experimental diets containing either 20% carbohydrates/50% proteins (C20P50), high levels carbohydrates expense proteins (35% carbohydrates/35% proteins--C35P35). expression genes related hepatic muscle glycolysis (glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase hexokinase) illustrates poor utilisation carbohydrates irrespective dietary levels. increased postprandial GK activity absence inhibition gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase activity support hypothesis existence futile cycle around glucose phosphorylation extending postprandial hyperglycaemia. 9 weeks feeding, C35P35-fed trout displayed lower body weight feed efficiency reduced protein fat gains fed C20P50. reduced activation eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) muscle C35P35 group suggests reduction protein synthesis, possibly contributing reduction N gain. increase dietary carbohydrate:protein ratio decreased expression genes involved amino acid catabolism (serine dehydratase branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase E1alpha E1beta), increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, suggesting higher reliance lipids energy source fish fed high-carbohydrate low-protein diets. probably also contributes lower fat gain. Together, results show different metabolic pathways affected high-carbohydrate/low-protein diet rainbow trout.
