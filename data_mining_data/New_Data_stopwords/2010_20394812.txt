 2,2',4,4',5,5'-Hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) non-metabolizable environmental chemical contaminant commonly found breast milk PCB exposed individuals, suggesting chronic exposure PCB-153 could adverse health effects. shown previously PCB-153 increased reactive oxygen species levels non-tumorigenic MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells, associated DNA damage, growth inhibition, cytotoxicity. study investigates hypothesis PCB-153 exposure coordinates cell cycle progression cellular metabolism inhibiting cyclin D1 accumulation. PCB-153 treated MCF-10A cells exhibited dose time dependent decrease cyclin D1 protein levels. decrease cyclin D1 protein levels associated inhibition AKT GSK-3beta phosphorylation, correlated increase cyclin D1-T286 phosphorylation. Fibroblasts carrying mutant form cyclin D1 (T286A) resistant PCB-153 induced degradation cyclin D1. Pre-treatment cells proteasome inhibitor (MG132) suppressed PCB-153 induced decrease cyclin D1 protein levels. Interestingly, suppression cyclin D1 accumulation associated increase cellular glucose consumption, hexokinase II pyruvate kinase protein levels. results suggest cyclin D1 coordinates cell cycle progression cellular metabolism PCB-153 treated non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells.
