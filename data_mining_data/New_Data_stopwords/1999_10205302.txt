 Recent experimental findings structural--functional features pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) isolated various sources compared. Two alternative mechanisms (a b) dephosphorylation E1 component pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) discussed: a) reaction occurs result stochastic collisions PDP PDC, generation enzyme--substrate complex (PDP--E1--PDC) dephosphorylation E1 component occur independently different PDP binding sites PDC core; b) dephosphorylation performed simultaneously certain number PDP molecules symmetrically bound PDC core. second mechanism suggested self-assembly theory multicomponent enzyme systems proved kinetic experiments. Based self-assembly principles data feasible binding sites peripheral components PDC, stoichiometry mutual location PDP, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, E1 component core mammalian PDC postulated provide optimal functioning PDC. Structural mechanisms stimulation PDP activity Ca2+ polyamines also discussed.
