 Mutations hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF-1alpha) lead maturity-onset diabetes young type 3 result impaired insulin secretory response pancreatic beta-cells. expression 50 genes essential normal beta-cell function studied better define molecular mechanism underlying insulin secretion defect Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice. found decreased steady-state mRNA levels genes encoding glucose transporter 2 (Glut2), neutral basic amino acid transporter, liver pyruvate kinase (L-Pk), insulin Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice. addition, determined expression several islet-enriched transcription factors, including Pdx-1, Hnf-4alpha, Neuro-D1/Beta-2, reduced Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice. changes pancreatic islet mRNA levels already apparent newborn animals, suggesting loss Hnf-1alpha function rather chronic hyperglycemia primary cause altered gene expression. expression profile pancreatic islet-specific distinct hepatocytes, found normal expression Glut2, L-Pk, Hnf-4alpha liver Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice. expression small heterodimer partner (Shp-1), orphan receptor heterodimerize Hnf-4alpha inhibit transcriptional activity, also reduced Hnf-1alpha(-/-) islets. characterized 0.58-kb Shp-1 promoter determined decreased expression Shp-1 may indirectly mediated downregulation Hnf-4alpha. showed Shp-1 repress transcriptional activation inhibiting Hnf-4alpha function, thereby establishing feedback autoregulatory loop. results indicate loss Hnf-1alpha function leads altered expression genes involved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin synthesis, beta-cell differentiation.
