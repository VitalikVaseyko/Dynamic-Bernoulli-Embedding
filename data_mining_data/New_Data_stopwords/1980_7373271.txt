 Pyruvate kinase occurs two major forms coho salmon; type isozyme occurs primarily muscle heart, type K generalized tissue distribution, parallel type K isozyme vertebrate systems. order assess evolutionary relationships among fish, avian, mammalian isozymes pyruvate kinase, purified two isozymes fish, examined physical properties, studied immunological relationships avian mammalian isozymes. Salmon type K least partially inactivated antibody bivine type L pyruvate kinase well antibodies produced chicken, bovine, salmon type isozymes. Salmon type pyruvate kinase, hand, significantly corss-reactive bovine type L isozyme, least partially inactivated antibodies produced bovine chicken type isozymes. Mammalian type L pyruvate kinase immunologically distinct either mammalian type K type M, salmon type K structural features common three mammalian isozymes. Thus, salmon fish type K pyruvate kinase could similar primordial form antecedent three major differentiated isozymes higher vertebrates.
