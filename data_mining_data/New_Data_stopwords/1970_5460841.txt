 property glucose nonfermentation, characteristic genus Veillonella, investigated V. alcalescens C1, strain sheep rumen origin. Cell-free extracts well intact cells incapable glucose fermentation, thereby eliminating possibility nonpermeation. Assimilation (14)C-glucose detectable. 10 glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, phosphoglyceromutase, pyruvate kinase detectable. glycolytic enzymes present.
