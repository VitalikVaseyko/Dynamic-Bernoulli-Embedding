 Smad transcription factors mediate growth inhibitory effect transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) many cell types. Mutational inactivation Smads correlated loss responsiveness TGF-beta-mediated signal transduction. study, compare contribution individual Smads TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition endogenous gene expression isogenic cellular backgrounds. Smad2, Smad3 Smad4 expression selectively inhibited differentiation-competent cells using improved antisense molecules. found TGF-beta mediates inhibitory effect HaCaT keratinocyte cell growth predominantly Smad3. Inhibition Smad3 expression sufficient interfere TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest induce suppress endogenous cell cycle regulators. Inhibition Smad4 expression exhibited partial effect, whereas inhibition Smad2 expression effect. gene expression profiling, identified TGF-beta-dependent genes differentially regulated Smad2 Smad3 regular growth conditions genome-wide scale. show Smad2, Smad3 Smad4 contribute regulation TGF-beta responses varying extents, demonstrate, addition, Smads exhibit distinct roles different cell types.
