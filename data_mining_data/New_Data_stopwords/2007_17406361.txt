 Stool testing based tumour-derived markers might offer promising approach non-invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. aim study estimate potential new test faecal tumour M2-PK discriminate patients CRC large sample unselected older adults. Faecal tumour M2-PK concentrations determined 65 CRC patients population-based sample 917 older adults (median age: 65 62 years, respectively). Sensitivity specificity test calculated different cutoff values, receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) constructed visualise discriminatory power test. median (interquartile range) faecal tumour M2-PK concentration 8.6 U ml(-1) (2.8-18.0) among CRC patients <2 U ml(-1) (<2-3.2; P<0.0001) population sample. cutoff value 4 U ml(-1), sensitivity (95% confidence interval) 85% (65-96%) colon cancer 56% (41-74%) rectum cancer. Specificity (95% confidence interval) estimated 79% (76-81%). Given comparatively high sensitivity tumour M2-PK stool test (especially colon cancer) simple analysis, potential use test early detection CRC merits investigation. Possibilities enhance specificity test explored.
