 Pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (TD) well-established model Wernicke's encephalopathy glutamate-mediated excitotoxic mechanism may play important role determining selective vulnerability. order examine possibility, cultured astrocytes exposed TD effects glutamate transport metabolic function studied. TD led decreases cellular levels thiamine thiamine diphosphate (TDP) 24 h treatment decreased activities TDP-dependent enzymes alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase transketolase 4 7 days, respectively. TD treatment 10 days led reversible decrease uptake [(3)H]-D-aspartate, nonmetabolizable analogue glutamate. Kinetic analysis revealed uptake inhibition caused 47% decrease V(max) uptake [(3)H]-D-aspartate, change K(m) value. Immunoblotting showed decrease uptake due 81% downregulation astrocyte-specific GLAST glutamate transporter. Loss uptake activity GLAST protein blocked treatment protein kinase C inhibitor H7, exposure DCG IV, group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, resulted improvement [(3)H]-D-aspartate uptake partial reversal transporter downregulation. results consistent recent vivo findings loss astrocytic glutamate transporters TD provide evidence TD conditions may increase phosphorylation GLAST, contributing downregulation. addition, manipulation group II mGluR activity may provide important strategy treatment disorder.
