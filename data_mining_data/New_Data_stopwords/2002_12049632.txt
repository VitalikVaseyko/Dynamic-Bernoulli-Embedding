 Inactivation cardiac pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) prolonged starvation response hyperthyroidism associated enhanced protein expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoform 4. present study examined potential role peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) adaptive modification cardiac PDK4 protein expression starvation hyperthyroidism. PDK4 protein expression analysed immunoblotting homogenates hearts fed 48 h-starved rats, rats rendered hyperthyroid subcutaneous injection tri-iodothyronine subgroup euthyroid rats maintained high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet, without treatment PPARalpha agonist WY14,643. addition, PDK4 protein expression analysed hearts fed, 24 h-starved 6 h-refed wild-type PPARalpha-null mice. PPARalpha activation WY14,643 vivo timescale response starvation failed up-regulate cardiac PDK4 protein expression rats maintained standard diet (WY14,643, 1.1-fold increase; starvation, 1.8-fold increase) influence cardiac PDK4 response starvation. contrast, PPARalpha activation WY14,643 vivo significantly enhanced cardiac PDK4 protein expression rats maintained high-fat diet, increased cardiac PDK4 protein expression. PPARalpha deficiency abolish up-regulation cardiac PDK4 protein expression response starvation (2.9-fold increases wild-type PPARalpha-null mice). Starvation hyperthyroidism exerted additive effects cardiac PDK4 protein expression, PPARalpha activation WY14,643 influence response cardiac PDK4 protein expression hyperthyroidism either fed starved state. data support hypothesis cardiac PDK4 protein expression regulated, least part, fatty acid-dependent, PPARalpha-independent mechanism strongly implicate fall insulin either initiating facilitating response cardiac PDK4 protein expression starvation.
