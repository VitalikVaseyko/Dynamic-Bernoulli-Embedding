 study, investigated whether gastric cancer hypoxia-induced resistance 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) could re-sensitized following treatment low-dose dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor glycolytic pathway. expression profiles hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1) analyzed tissues 10 patients gastric cancer different responses adjuvant 5-FU treatment. vitro assays, cell viability apoptosis evaluated without treatment 20mM DCA AGS MKN45 cell lines, well PDK1 knockdown cell lines. expression levels HIF-1alpha PDK-1 elevated tumor tissues relative normal gastric tissues patients showed recurrence adjuvant 5-FU treatment. Cellular viability tests showed cell lines lower sensitivity 5-FU hypoxic conditions compared normoxic conditions. Moreover, addition 20mM DCA increased sensitivity cells 5-FU hypoxic conditions, resistance 5-FU hypoxia also attenuated PDK1 knockdown cell lines. conclusion, DCA treatment able re-sensitize gastric cancer cells hypoxia-induced resistance 5-FU alteration glucose metabolism.
