 PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) key enzyme controlling rate glucose oxidation, availability gluconeogenic precursors. Activation PDH skeletal muscle liver may increase glucose uptake reduce glucose production. study describes properties AZD7545, novel, small-molecule inhibitor PDHK (PDH kinase). presence PDHK2, AZD7545 increased PDH activity EC(50) value 5.2 nM. rat hepatocytes, rate pyruvate oxidation stimulated 2-fold (EC(50) 105 nM). single dose AZD7545 Wistar rats increased proportion liver PDH active, dephosphorylated form dose-related manner 24.7 70.3% 30 mg/kg; skeletal muscle 21.1 53.3%. single dose 10 mg/kg also significantly elevated muscle PDH activity obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats. Obese, insulin-resistant, Zucker rats show elevated postprandial glucose levels compared lean counterparts (8.7 versus 6.1 mM 12 weeks old). AZD7545 (10 mg/kg) twice daily 7 days markedly improved 24-h glucose profile, eliminating postprandial elevation blood glucose. results suggest PDHK inhibitors may beneficial agents improving glucose control treatment type 2 diabetes.
