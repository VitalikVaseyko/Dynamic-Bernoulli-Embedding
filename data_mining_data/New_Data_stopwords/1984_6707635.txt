 enzyme complement two different mitochondrial preparations adult rat brain studied. One population mitochondria (synaptic) prepared lysis synaptosomes, (non-synaptic free) separation homogenates. populations prepared distinct regions brain: cortex, striatum, pons medulla oblongata. following enzymes measured: pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1), citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7), NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.41), NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42), fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2), NAD-linked malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30), mitochondrially bound hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2). nonsynaptic (free) mitochondria show higher enzyme specific activities regions studied corresponding values recorded synaptic mitochondria. significance observations discussed light different metabolic activities two populations mitochondria compartmentation metabolic activities brain.
