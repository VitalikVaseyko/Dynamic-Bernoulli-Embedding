 Rapidly proliferating cells, cancer cells, adopted aerobic glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation supply energy demand; phenomenon known 'the Warburg effect'. widely accepted apoptosis loss energy production, orchestrated caspases, contributes dismantling dying cell. However, loss energy production occurs still partially known. present work, established apoptosis level cellular ATP decreased caspase-dependent manner. demonstrated decrease ATP content independent caspase modification glucose uptake, ATP consumption reactive oxygen species production dependent caspase-dependent inhibition glycolysis. found activity two glycolysis-limiting enzymes, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, affected caspases, whereas activity phosphoglycerate kinase not, suggesting specificity effect. Finally, using metabolomic analysis, observed caspases led decrease several key metabolites, including phosphoserine, major regulator pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme activity. Thus, established apoptosis, caspases shut main energy production pathway cancer cells, leading impairment activity two enzymes controlling limiting steps glycolysis.
