 Regulation glycolytic pathway considered primarily achieved carbon metabolites resulting glucose metabolism [e.g., fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), citrate] ATP charge cell. divalent cations (e.g., Mg2+ Mn2+) considered regulatory roles glycolysis, although involved almost every enzyme-catalyzed reaction pathway. Using kinetic linked-function analysis steady-state kinetic data interactions PEP, FDP, Mn2+ yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK), found divalent metal principal trigger allosteric responses observed enzyme. interaction Mn2+ YPK enhances interaction FDP -1.6 kcal/mol interaction PEP -2.8 kcal/mol. simultaneous interaction three ligands YPK favored -4.3 kcal/mol sum independent binding free energies. Surprisingly, binding allosteric activator FDP directly influence binding substrate PEP since coupling free energy near zero calculated two ligands. Thus, communication PEP FDP sites occurs structurally metal allosteric relay mechanism. conclusions supported results thermodynamic linked-function analysis direct binding data interactions PEP, FDP, Mn2+ YPK [Mesecar, A. D., & Nowak, T. (1997) Biochemistry (following paper series)]. findings raise important questions possible roles divalent metals modulating multiligand interactions YPK regulation glycolytic pathway.
