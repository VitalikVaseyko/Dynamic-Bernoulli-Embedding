 pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex undergoes reversible phosphorylation catalyzed PDH kinase (inactivating) PDH phosphatase (activating). skeletal muscle, decreased proportion active PDH (PDHa) complex limits glucose oxidation insulin-deficient states. time-course reactivation PDH complex insulin skeletal muscle diabetic rats important understanding potential mode action insulin regulating glucose metabolism. single injection insulin (1 U/kg) completely reversed effects alloxan-diabetes PDHa activity within 1 hour. normalization effects diabetes PDHa activity insulin maintained minimum 6 hours. increase PDHa activity occurred insulin-induced decrease plasma free fatty acids levels, demonstrating dissociation antilipolytic effects insulin ability activate PDH complex. PDH kinase activity normalized control values following single injection insulin. Therefore, acute (1 6 hours) insulin-mediated activation PDH complex result decrease PDH kinase activity. However, longer-term insulin therapy (1 U/kg body weight; twice daily) restored PDHa PDH kinase activities. results consistent hypothesis activation PDH complex immediately following insulin administration mediated decreased PDH kinase activity. However, daily insulin therapy diabetes, activation PDH complex results decreased PDH kinase activity.
