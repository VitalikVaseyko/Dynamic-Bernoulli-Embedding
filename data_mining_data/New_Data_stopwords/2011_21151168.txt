 Hematopoietic cells normally require cell extrinsic signals maintain metabolism survival. contrast, cancer cells express constitutively active oncogenic kinases BCR-Abl promote processes independent extrinsic growth factors. cells receive insufficient growth signals oncogenic kinases inhibited, glucose metabolism decreases self-digestive process autophagy elevated degrade bulk cytoplasm organelles. Although autophagy proposed provide cell-intrinsic nutrient supply mitochondrial oxidative metabolism maintain cellular homeostasis degradation damaged organelles protein aggregates, acute role growth factor deprivation inhibition oncogenic kinases remains poorly understood. therefore developed growth factor-dependent hematopoietic cell culture model autophagy acutely disrupted conditional Cre-mediated excision autophagy-essential gene Atg3. Treated cells rapidly lost ability perform autophagy underwent cell cycle arrest apoptosis. Although Atg3 essential optimal upregulation mitochondrial oxidative pathways growth factor withdrawal, metabolic contribution autophagy appear critical cell survival, provision exogenous pyruvate lipids could completely rescue Atg3 deficiency. Instead, autophagy suppressed stress response otherwise led p53 phosphorylation upregulation p21 pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Puma. Importantly, BCR-Abl-expressing cells low basal levels autophagy, highly dependent process, rapidly underwent apoptosis upon disruption autophagy Atg3 deletion treatment chemical autophagy inhibitors. dependence autophagy extended vivo, Atg3 deletion also prevented BCR-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis cell transfer model. Together data demonstrate critical role autophagy mitigate cell stress, cells expressing oncogenic kinase BCR-Abl appear particularly dependent autophagy cell survival leukemogenesis.
