 BRAF mutations known drivers melanoma development and, recently, also described players Warburg effect, reprogramming energy metabolism identified possible strategy treating melanoma patients. Therefore, aim work evaluate expression prognostic value panel glycolytic metabolism-related proteins series melanomas. immunohistochemical expression MCT1, MCT4, GLUT1, CAIX evaluated 356 patients presenting melanoma 20 patients presenting benign nevi. Samples included 20 benign nevi, 282 primary melanomas, 117 lymph node 54 distant metastases samples. BRAF mutation observed 29/92 (31.5%) melanoma patients 17/20 (85%) benign nevi samples. NRAS mutation observed 4/36 (11.1%) melanoma patients 1/19 (5.3%) benign nevi samples. MCT4 GLUT1 expression significantly increased metastatic samples, MCT1, MCT4 GLUT1 significantly associated poor prognostic variables. Importantly, MCT1 MCT4 associated shorter overall survival. conclusion, present study brings new insights metabolic aspects melanoma, paving way development new-targeted therapies.
