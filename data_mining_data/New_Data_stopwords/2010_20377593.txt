 genetic component susceptibility malaria complex multigenic better-known protective polymorphisms involving erythrocyte-specific structural proteins enzymes. vivo vitro data suggested pyruvate kinase deficiency, causes nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia, could protective malaria severity humans, hypothesis remains tested. present study, conducted combined analysis Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) pyruvate kinase-encoding gene (PKLR) adjacent regions (chromosome 1q21) look malaria selective signatures two sub-Saharan African populations Angola Mozambique, several groups different malaria infection outcome. European population Portugal, including control pyruvate kinase-deficient group, used comparison. Data STR SNP loci spread along PKLR gene region showed considerably higher differentiation African Portuguese populations usually found neutral markers. addition, wider region showing strong linkage disequilibrium found uncomplicated malaria group, haplotype found associated clinical group. Altogether, data suggests malaria selective pressure acting genomic region.
