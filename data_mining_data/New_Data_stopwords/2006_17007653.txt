 OBJECTIVES: determine prevalence haemoglobin (Hb) variants glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency Rwanda. METHODS: two-month period 2005, 987 cord blood samples obtained two hospitals Kigali Butare, Rwanda. Screening sickle cell disorders, Hb disorders, G6PD deficiency rare erythroenzymopathy deficiencies done using isoelectric focusing techniques quantitative kinetic assays, respectively. RESULTS: prevalence Hb trait 2.7% G6PD deficiency 3.8%. neonate suffered sickle cell disease (homozygous Hb compound heterozygous Hb S), another clinically significant haemoglobinopathy, pyruvate kinase glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Sickle cell disorders considered public health problem Kigali Butare. systematic neonatal screening programme disorders, diagnose G6PD deficiency, seems reasonable, local health priorities must considered. Adapted management hereditary sickle cell G6PD disorders available.
