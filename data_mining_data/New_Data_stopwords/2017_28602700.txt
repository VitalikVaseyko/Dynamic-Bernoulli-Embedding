 Cancer cells usually utilize glucose carbon source aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Increasing studies shown PVT1 (a long non-coding RNA, lncRNA) functions critical regulator multiple cancers. However, remains totally unknown whether PVT1 regulates glucose metabolism OS cells. study, found expression PVT1 specifically increased OS cells tissues, upregulated PVT1 indicated poor prognosis. Glucose uptake, lactate production, expression HK2 OS cells increased overexpression PVT1, decreased PVT1 knockdown. fund PVT1 acted molecular sponge repress miR-497. Inhibition miR-497 promoted glucose consumption lactate production, phenomenon could reversed PVT1 silencing. Moreover, HK2 direct target miR-497 overexpression HK2 attenuated suppressive effect miR-497 glycolysis. Functionally, knockdown PVT1 exerted tumor-suppressive effect suppressing cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, invasion vitro, whereas miR-497 inhibitor partially abolished inhibition effect si-PVT1. Overexpression HK2 attenuated miR-497 induced inhibition cell growth motility. Taken together, findings suggested PVT1 contributes OS cell glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, motility miR-497/HK2 pathway, revealed novel relation lncRNA alteration glycolysis OS cells.
