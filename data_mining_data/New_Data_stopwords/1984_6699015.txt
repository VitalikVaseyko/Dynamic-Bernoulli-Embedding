 structure D-xylose isomerase Streptomyces rubiginosus determined 4-A resolution using multiple isomorphous phasing techniques. folding polypeptide chain established consists two structural domains. larger domain consists eight beta-strand alpha-helix (beta alpha) units arranged configuration similar found triose phosphate isomerase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase, pyruvate kinase. smaller domain forms loop away larger domain overlapping larger domain another subunit tightly bound dimer formed. tetramer consists two dimers. location active site enzyme tentatively identified studies using crystal grown solution containing inhibitor xylitol.
