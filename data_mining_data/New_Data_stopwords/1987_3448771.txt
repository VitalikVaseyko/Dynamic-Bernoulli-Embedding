 activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, enolase pyruvate kinase studied breast cancer tissues, comparison benign breast disease normal breast tissues. enzyme activities breast cancer significantly increased compared normal benign breast tissues (p less 0.001). Also increase activity benign disease compared normal statistically significant (p less 0.001). Within group benign diseases, fibroadenomas could distinguished fibrocystic disease, former generally showing higher activities compared latter (p less equal 0.05). Carcinoma subgroups, classified according histology, could recognized enzymologically. addition, isozyme composition pyruvate kinase enolase studied. find significant shift towards K type pyruvate kinase expression benign disease compared normal breast tissues. Also fibroadenomas differ fibrocystic disease. However, amount K type pyruvate kinase carcinomas proved significantly higher comparison benign disease normal breast tissues (p less 0.001). Expression alpha gamma-enolase normal breast tissue virtually absent. benign disease minority specimens show hybrid alpha gamma-enolase. Nearly carcinomas alpha gamma-enolase expression 20% carcinomas gamma gamma-enolase could detected (so-called neuron-specific enolase). discriminant analysis, function giving best discrimination compared histological data based natural logarithm aldolase total gamma-enolase subunits. Contrary expectation, regulator enzymes glycolysis; i.e., hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase included discriminant function. best fit produced 90% correct classification benign malignant disease. findings confirmed larger series, discrimination sufficiently strong form basis clinically useful tool.
