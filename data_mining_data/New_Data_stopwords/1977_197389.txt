 fdp mutation localized genome Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, chromosome II, lys2 tyr1, man distance 31 centimorgan lys2. Since fdp mutant grow glucose, fructose, mannose sucrose, hexose transport number enzymes carbon metabolism tested, significant differences could found wild type mutant. regulatory properties glycogen synthetase changed mutant, doubtful whether explain phenotype. disorganization carbon metabolism mutant upon addition glucose medium analyzed detail. prominent feature observed accumulation free glucose hexose phosphates cell. result indicates somehow feedback control hexose transport metabolism impaired. Hexose phosphates known toxic many cells, including yeast. Therefore, accumulation hexose phosphates presence glucose medium, explain absence growth carbon source.
