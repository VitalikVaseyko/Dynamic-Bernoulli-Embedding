 Homogenates Trypanoplasma borelli subjected subcellular fractionation sequential differential isopycnic centrifugation sucrose. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glycolytic enzymes, glucosephosphate isomerase triosephosphate isomerase, well peroxisomal marker enzyme catalase mainly, part, associated sedimentable particles buoyant density sucrose 1.22 g cm-3. Moreover, triosephosphate isomerase exhibited latency, total homogenates particulate fraction. Electron microscopy thin sections T. borelli revealed presence microbodies gave positive reaction catalase. Pyruvate kinase behaved typical soluble enzyme. stimulated micromolar concentrations fructose 2,6-bisphosphate stimulation counteracted inorganic phosphate millimolar range. enzymes involved synthesis degradation fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, present T. borelli behaved soluble enzymes. conclude T. borelli glycolytic pathway compartmentalized way similar found another Kinetoplastid family, Trypanosomatidae, seven glycolytic enzymes two enzymes glycerol metabolism associated glycosomes. Apparently presence glycosomes characteristic Kinetoplastida.
