 Enzyme activity declines erythrocyte age mammals. test concept dog, decreased PCV less 20 phlebotomy. erythrocytes restored rapidly (1.57 per cent per day). resulting decline mean erythrocyte age accompanied increased activity erythrocyte enzymes studied. Enzymes lower initial enzymatic activity (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase glutathione reductase) increased proportionally higher initial activity (lactate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase glucose-6-dehydrogenase). Among species, increases enzyme activity phlebotomy appear related species' life span. metabolites increased concomitantly highest reticulocyte period. Diphosphoglycerate concentrations change significantly experiment.
