 Reprogramming intracellular metabolism common liver cancer cells. Understanding mechanisms cell metabolic reprogramming may present new basis liver cancer treatment. previous study, reported novel oncogene eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) promotes tumorigenesis hypoxic condition. Here, aim investigate role EIF5A2 cell metabolic reprogramming hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. study, reported messenger RNA (mRNA) level EIF5A2 upregulated 59 105 (56.2%) HCC clinical samples (P = 0.015), EIF5A2 overexpression significantly associated shorter survival time patients HCC (P = 0.021). Ectopic expression EIF5A2 HCC cell lines significantly promoted cell growth accelerated glucose utilization lipogenesis rates. high rates glucose uptake lactate secretion conferred EIF5A2 revealed abnormal activity aerobic glycolysis HCC cells. Several key enzymes involved glycolysis including glucose transporter type 1 2, hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase liver type, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 lactate dehydrogenase upregulated overexpression EIF5A2. Moreover, EIF5A2 showed positive correlations FASN ACSS2, two key enzymes involved fatty acid de novo biosynthetic pathway, protein mRNA levels HCC. results indicated EIF5A2 may regulate fatty acid de novo biosynthesis increasing uptake acetate. conclusion, findings demonstrate EIF5A2 critical role HCC cell metabolic reprogramming may serve prominent novel therapeutic target liver cancer treatment.
