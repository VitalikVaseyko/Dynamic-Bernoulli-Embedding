 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) important glycolytic enzyme, manipulation regulatory behavior allosteric modifiers interest medicinal purposes. Human-erythrocyte PK expressed Rosetta cells purified Ni-NTA column. search small-molecules database National Cancer Institute (NCI), using UNITY software, led identification several compounds similar pharmacophores fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), natural allosteric activator human kinases. compounds subsequently docked FBP binding site using programs FlexX GOLD, interactions protein analyzed energy-scoring function HINT. Seven promising candidates, compounds 1-7, obtained NCI, subjected kinetics analysis, revealed activators inhibitors R-isozyme PK (R-PK). allosteric effectors discovered study could prove lead compounds developing medications treatment hemolytic anemia, sickle-cell anemia, hypoxia-related diseases, disorders arising erythrocyte PK malfunction.
