 OBJECTIVES: determine whether pyruvate-fortified cardioplegia solution provides cardioprotection superior lactate-based cardioplegia solutions patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization, specific attention post-surgical recovery left ventricular performance well biochemical markers ischemic injury. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, semi-blinded human trial. SETTING: Community-based academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty adult patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients randomized two 4:1 blood cardioplegia solutions, one pyruvate enhanced lactate based. Hemodynamic laboratory variables measured patients pre-cross-clamp, post-cross-clamp, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours bypass. MEASUREMENTS MAIN RESULTS: Relative lactate-based cardioplegia, pyruvate-fortified cardioplegia sharply increased left ventricular stroke work 4 12 hours bypass (p < 0.001), lowered coronary sinus troponin creatine phosphokinase-MB activities 67% (p < 0.001) 53% (p < 0.01), respectively, increased coronary sinus hemoglobin O(2) saturation 18% (p < 0.001). Ten patients treated lactate cardioplegia required beta-adrenergic inotropic support postbypass, 4 pyruvate-treated patients required beta-adrenergic support (p = 0.067). Pyruvate cardioplegia shortened postsurgery hospitalization 6.3 +/- 0.3 5.2 +/- 0.1 days (p < 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Pyruvate-fortified cardioplegia mitigated myocardial injury coronary artery bypass surgery facilitated postsurgical recovery cardiac performance. Thus, pyruvate-enhanced cardioplegia may provide cardioprotection superior lactate-based solutions surgical cardiac arrest.
