 1920s, Otto Warburg observed tumor cells consumed large amount glucose, much normal cells, converted lactic acid. phenomenon, known "Warburg effect," foundation one earliest general concepts cancer: fundamental disturbance cellular metabolic activity root tumor formation growth. ensuing decades, became apparent abnormalities chromosomes eventually individual genes caused cancer, "metabolic" model cancer lost good deal appeal, even emerging technologies exploiting Warburg effect clinically detect tumors vivo. know tumor suppressors proto-oncogenes influence metabolism, mutations genes promote metabolic phenotype supporting cell growth proliferation. Thus, advances unified aspects metabolic genetic models cancer, stimulated renewed interest role cellular metabolism tumorigenesis. review reappraises notion dysregulated cellular metabolism key feature cancer, discusses metabolic issues escaped scrutiny years deserve closer attention.
