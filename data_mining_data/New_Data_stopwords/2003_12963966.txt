 PFKFB (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) bifunctional enzyme regulates steady-state concentration fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, potent activator key regulatory enzyme glycolysis, phosphofructokinase. PFKFB3 (iPFK2) one four tissue-specific PFKFB isozymes identified date. PFKFB3 also implicated high glycolytic rate cancer cells occurs despite adequate oxygen, phenomenon known Warburg effect. isolated characterized human PFKFB3 genomic sequence, spans region 32.5 kb single chromosomal locus. Determination exon-intron splice junctions established PFKFB3 encoded 19 exons 15 normally expressed. Exon sizes range 23 208 bp, largest intron 10,286 bp long. full-length human PFKFB3 open reading frame 4,675 bp long encodes 590 aa protein predicted molecular weight 66.9 kDa isoelectric point 8.64. Fluorescence situ hybridization analysis localized human PFKFB3 gene chromosome 10p15.3-p15.2, locus 3 million bp centromeric PFKP, platelet-type phosphofructokinase. PFKFB3 shown abundantly expressed human tumors expression linked long-standing observations concerning apparent coupling enhanced glycolysis cell proliferation.
