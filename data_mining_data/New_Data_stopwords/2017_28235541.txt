 limited number studies indicated association mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) cellular metabolism. Here, employing inducible RNA interference approach A375 melanoma cells coupled PCR array multiple validation approaches, demonstrated PLK1 alters number genes associated cellular metabolism. PLK1 knockdown resulted significant downregulation IDH1, PDP2 PCK1 upregulation FBP1. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified 1) glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway major canonical pathways associated PLK1, 2) PLK1 inhibition-modulated genes largely associated cellular proliferation, FBP1 key modulator. Further, BI 6727-mediated inhibition PLK1 caused decrease PCK1 increase FBP1 A375 melanoma cell implanted xenografts vivo. Furthermore, inverse correlation PLK1 FBP1 found melanoma cells, FBP1 expression significantly downregulated panel melanoma cells. addition, BI 6727 treatment resulted upregulation FBP1 A375, Hs294T G361 melanoma cells. Overall, study suggests PLK1 may important regulator metabolism maintenance melanoma cells.
