 BACKGROUND PURPOSE: Endothelial cell activation plays critical role regulating leukocyte recruitment inflammation infection. Ethanol (EtOH) reduces host defence systems, including cell adhesion. However, well-known side effects EtOH limit clinical use anti-inflammatory drug. Instead, ethyl pyruvate (EtP) may represent better alternative. Here, compared effects EtP EtOH neutrophil recruitment activation human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Adhesion neutrophils HUVEC monolayers, surface expression intercellular cell adhesion molecule, E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule, release interleukin (IL)-8 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) HUVECs assessed well translocation interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) subunits p50, p65 IkappaB-alpha. NF-kappaB activation analysed luciferase reporter plasmid. Cells stimulated IL-1beta, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tumour necrosis factor-alpha. KEY RESULTS: EtP several-fold potent EtOH reducing adhesion neutrophils activated HUVECs, generation IL-8 G-CSF surface expression adhesion molecules. last reaction decreased EtP even added cytokines LPS. Translocation IRAK-1, IkappaBalpha NF-kappaB p65 subunit HUVEC nucleus inhibited EtP stimuli, whereas diminished p50 translocation stimulus specific. p65 constitutively expressed Cos7 cells, stimulation NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene affected EtP, suggesting EtP acted upstream gene activation. CONCLUSIONS IMPLICATIONS: EtP impedes adhesive, secretory signalling events typical early inflammatory response endothelial cells, suggesting EtP possible treatment acute inflammatory conditions.
