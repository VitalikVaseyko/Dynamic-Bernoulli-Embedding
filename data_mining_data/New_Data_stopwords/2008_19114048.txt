 search tumor-specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations head neck squamous cell cancer, found heteroplasmy blood two individuals, i.e., individuals carried two alleles mtDNA. cases, tumor found homoplasmic, i.e., contained one two mtDNA alleles present blood. interestingly, one case tumor acquired wild-type allele, case contained mutant allele only. Sequencing whole 16.5 kb mtDNA showed observed heteroplasmic positions D-loop region, nucleotides 152 16187, respectively, differences tumor blood mtDNA genotypes individuals. findings thus strongly support hypothesis accumulation mtDNA mutations solid tumors occurs clonal random expansion pre-existing alleles necessary metabolic changes generally associated tumor formation, Warburg effect.
