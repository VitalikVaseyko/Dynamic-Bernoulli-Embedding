 rapid convenient procedure developed measurement mRNA half-life S.cerevisiae using transcriptional inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline. range half-lives 6.6 +/- 0.67 minutes 100 minutes, relative stability 18S rRNA control, obtained fifteen mRNAs. include pyruvate kinase actin mRNAs, well 13 randomly picked mRNAs unknown function. mRNAs clearly fall two populations lengths half-lives analysed; one population considerably stable mRNAs similar length compared. Also, within population, inverse relationship mRNA length half-life. results suggest mRNA length least one additional factor strongly influence mRNA stability yeast.
