 BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) major risk factor cardiovascular disease, prevalence increased significantly recent decades epidemic proportions China. Individually, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum) seed, mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) root improve glycemia various animal models humans impaired glucose metabolism T2DM. aim study design optimized botanical formula containing herbal extracts nutritional strategy prevention insulin resistance T2DM. METHODS: Cell-free alpha-amylase alpha-glucosidase enzyme assays used determine inhibitory potential extracts. Glucose uptake examined differentiated human adipocytes using radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose. Male Sprague Dawley rats divided glycemia balanced 5 groups: two controls (naive model) three doses botanical test formula containing standardized fenugreek seed, mulberry leaf American ginseng extracts (42.33, 84.66 169.33 mg/kg BW). Insulin resistance T2DM induced feeding animals high fat diet alloxan injection. Glucose tolerance examined measuring serum glucose levels following oral glucose load. RESULTS: Fenugreek seed mulberry leaf dose dependently inhibited alpha-amylase (IC50 = 73.2 mug/mL) alpha-glucosidase (IC50 = 111.8 ng/mL), respectively. three botanical extracts improved insulin sensitivity glucose uptake human adipocytes, lead design optimized botanical test formula. rat model insulin resistance T2DM, optimized botanical test formula improved fasting serum glucose levels, fasting insulin resistance development impaired glucose tolerance. reduction epididymal adipose tissue GLUT4 PDK1 expression induced high fat diet alloxan blunted botanical test formula. CONCLUSIONS: novel botanical formula containing standardized extracts mulberry leaf, fenugreek seed American ginseng ratio 1:1.3:3.4 prevented development insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance T2DM. Given rising need effective non-drug targeting insulin resistance progression T2DM, complementary alternative nutritional strategies without intolerable side effects could meaningful impact metabolic health diabetes risks.
