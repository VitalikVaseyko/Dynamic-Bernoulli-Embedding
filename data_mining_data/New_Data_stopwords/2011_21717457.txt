 Activation PI3K/Akt signaling pathway correlated poor prognosis neuroblastoma, common deadly extracranial tumor childhood. study, show small-molecule inhibitors phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) OSU03012 dual class PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI103 profound effects neuroblastoma survival vitro vivo. OSU03012 PI103 inhibited neuroblastoma growth vitro. treated cells, OSU03012 induced apoptosis phase cell cycle arrest, whereas minor apoptosis detected PI103 treated cells together G1 arrest. OSU03012 PI103 downregulated phosphorylation Akt inhibited downstream targets glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) p70 S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), well downregulated expression cyclin D1 Mycn protein. Neuroblastoma cells expressing high levels Mycn sensitive OSU03012 PI103 compared cells expressing low Mycn levels. compounds significantly inhibited growth established, subcutaneous MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma xenografts nude NMRI nu/nu mice. results suggest inhibition PI3K/Akt signaling pathway represent clinical relevant target treatment patients high-risk MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.
