 effects sodium nitroprusside (SNP), nitric oxide (NO) donor clinically used treatment hypertensive emergencies energy production rat reticulocytes investigated. Rat reticulocyte-rich red blood cell suspensions aerobically incubated without (control) presence different concentrations SNP (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mM). SNP decreased total coupled, increased uncoupled oxygen consumption. accompanied stimulation glycolysis, measured increased glucose consumption lactate accumulation. Levels glycolytic intermediates indicate stimulation hexokinase-phosphofructo kinase (HK-PFK), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) pyruvate kinase (PK) activities presence SNP. Due decrease coupled oxygen consumption presence SNP, ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation significantly diminished. Simultaneous increase glycolytic ATP production enough provide constant ATP production. addition, SNP significantly decreased ATP level, accompanied increased ADP AMP levels. However, level total adenine nucleotides significantly lower, consequence increased catabolism adenine nucleotides (increased hypoxanthine level). ATP/ADP ratio adenylate energy charge level significantly decreased. conclusion, SNP induced inhibition oxidative phosphorylation, stimulation glycolysis, depletion total energy production rat reticulocytes. alterations accompanied instability energy status.
