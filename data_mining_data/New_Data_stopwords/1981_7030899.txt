 plasma levels corticosterone, insulin glucagon, concomitant changes levels several liver enzymes metabolites measured intact rats basal state 24 hours conditions food deprivation hypoxia. levels following enzymes metabolites examined: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, glycogen, fructose-6-phosphate, hexokinase, tyrosine amino-transferase tryptophan oxygenase. food deprivation, increased gluconeogenesis possibly result glucagon activity. contrast, however, hypoxia increase gluconeogenesis seems result higher plasma level corticosterone. starvation, insulin concentration dropped steadily came close zero.
