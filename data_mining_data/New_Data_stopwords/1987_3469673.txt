 Sulfhydryl modification 22 human erythrocyte enzymes achieved exposing intact erythrocytes, hemolysates, partially purified enzymes persulfides (RSSH) generated nonenzymatically cystine presence pyridoxal phosphate mercaptopyruvate, donates sulfur suitable acceptors mediation carrier enzyme, mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.2). inhibition pattern qualitatively similar persulfides previously reported us methylthio-group donor, methyl methanethiosulfonate. Thirteen activities inhibited, 9 minimally affected. Pyruvate kinase similarly modified systems terms phosphoenolpyruvate kinetics, thermostability, interaction negative effector ATP. Partial-to-complete reversal inhibition documented subset activities inhibited mercaptopyruvate upon 30-min incubation 1 mM dithiothreitol. possible physiologic role methylthio groups persulfides discussed.
