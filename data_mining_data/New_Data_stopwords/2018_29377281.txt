 Cancer cells exhibit increased dependency aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon referred "Warburg effect" therefore, blocking glycolysis using non-metabolizable analogues glucose, like 2-Deoxy glucose (2-DG), proposed huge therapeutic importance. One major drawbacks using 2-DG chemotherapeutic agent induce ER stress. ER stress hall mark many solid tumors unfolded protein response (UPR) associated initiates many survival mechanisms cancer cells. present study, report novel survival mechanism associated ER stress, cancer cells become adapted aerobic glycolysis. ER stress induced Hela cells treating 2-DG Thapsigargin (TG) expression activity LDH significantly regulated, conferring cells greater glycolytic potential. simultaneous decrease observed expression miR-23a, predicted silico target site 3'UTR LDH B mRNAs. miRNA expression studies mRNA degradation assays suggest miR-23a could target LDH LDH B mRNAs. basis results previous scientific reports, propose "c-Myc," expressed ER stress, repress expression miR-23a, turn regulates expression target genes viz., LDH LDH B, thereby making cells competent survive tumor microenvironment, requires efficient use aerobic glycolysis.
