 Rainbow trout limited ability use dietary carbohydrates efficiently considered glucose intolerant. Administration carbohydrates results persistent hyperglycemia impairs post-prandial regulation gluconeogenesis despite normal insulin secretion. Since gluconeogenic genes mainly insulin control, put forward hypothesis transcriptional function insulin whole may impaired trout liver. order test hypothesis, performed intraperitoneal administration bovine insulin fasted rainbow trout also subjected rainbow trout primary hepatocytes insulin and/or glucose stimulation. demonstrate insulin able activate Akt, key element insulin signaling pathway, regulate hepatic metabolism-related target genes vivo vitro. way mammals, insulin decreased mRNA expression gluconeogenic genes, including glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Insulin also limited expression carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), limiting enzyme fatty acid beta-oxidation. vitro studies revealed that, mammals, glucose important regulator insulin target genes glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS). Interestingly, glucose also stimulates expression glucokinase (GK), equivalent mammals. study demonstrates insulin possesses intrinsic ability regulate hepatic gene expression rainbow trout, suggesting hormonal metabolic factors may counteract post-prandial actions insulin.
