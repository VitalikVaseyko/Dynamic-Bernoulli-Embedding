 Effect Capparis spinosa (C. spinosa) Acacia arabica (A. arabica) dry powder plant molluscicide glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes snail tissues, investigated. Lactate debydrogenase (LDH), Pyruvate Kinase (PK), Hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) important glycolytic enzymes, markedly manipulated plants measured one day one week post-treatment. hand glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6Pase), fructose 1.6 diphosphatase (FDpase), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gluconeogenic enzymes significantly affected moluscicidal plants. addition, parameters glycogen, glucose, total protein, 5-nucleotidase alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) kreb's cycle enzyme tested. conclusion, LC25 LC50 concentrations C. spinosa A. arabica might render B. alexandrina physiologically unsuitable S. mansoni infection.
