 physiological effects genetic transcriptional changes observed phenol producing mutant solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida S12 assessed metabolic flux analysis. upregulation malate/lactate dehydrogenase encoding gene could connected flux increase malate oxaloacetate. mutation pykA gene decreased vitro pyruvate kinase activity, consistent lower flux phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate. Changes oprB-1, gntP gnuK genes, encoding glucose-selective porin, gluconokinase gluconate transporter respectively, altered substrate uptake profile. Metabolic flux analysis furthermore revealed cellular events predicted transcriptome analysis. Gluconeogenic formation glucose-6-phosphate triose-3-phosphate abolished, favour increased phosphoenolpyruvate production. increased pentose phosphate pathway flux resulted higher erythrose-4-phosphate production. Thus, availability two central phenol precursors improved. Furthermore, metabolic fluxes redistributed overall TCA cycle flux unaffected energy production increased. Engineering P. putida S12 phenol production yielded strain channels carbon fluxes previously unfavourable routes reconcile drain metabolites required phenol production, maintaining basal flux levels central carbon metabolism.
