 hemolysate partially purified human red cells demonstrated capable synthesizing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2) fructose-6-phosphate presence adenosine triphosphate (ATP) indicating human red cells contain fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase. effect F-2,6-P2 rate-limiting enzymes glycolysis, ie, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase, also examined. PFK activated metabolite half-maximum activation obtained concentration 10(-7) mol/L. Neither hexokinase pyruvate kinase affected F-2,6-P2. results suggest human erythrocytes may contain metabolite one positive effectors PFK.
