 fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-activated pyruvate kinase Escherichia coli purified simplified procedure, gives homogeneous enzyme approximately half working time required methods suitable large scale preparations. activity enzyme strictly dependent presence monovalent cations. Enzyme activity elicited K+ NH4+, Na+. Homotropic cooperativity displayed activation K+ NH4+ heterotropic effects reciprocally exerted monovalent cations ligands, phosphoenolpyruvate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. allosteric nature interactions suggested changes heat stability enzyme induced K+ fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. NH4+, K+, high concentrations, cause inhibition enzyme activity.
