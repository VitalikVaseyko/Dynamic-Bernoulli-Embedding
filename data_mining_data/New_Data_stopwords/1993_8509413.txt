 Transcription L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene induced response increased carbohydrate metabolism liver. demonstrated previously segment 5'-flanking region L-PK gene -183 -96 necessary sufficient glucose response primary hepatocytes. explore protein factors involved carbohydrate regulation, performed mutational analyses vitro binding studies segment. Sequences critical glucose response mapped -171 -124. segment contains consensus binding sites two nuclear transcription factors: LF-A1 MLTF. factors capable binding corresponding L-PK sites vitro. Mutational functional analyses indicated LF-A1 indeed involved glucose induction L-PK gene. PK MLTF-like site consists two imperfect CACGTG motifs, core binding site family transcription factors related c-myc. Unexpectedly, mutations either motif resulted defective glucose stimulation retained vitro binding MLTF. Furthermore, authentic MLTF binding site adenovirus major late promoter functionally interchangeable natural sequence. data indicate binding MLTF, presence LF-A1, capable supporting glucose response. Conversion either imperfect motif CACGTG within context mutations disrupting opposite site restored response elevated glucose. Thus, factor recognizes PK MLTF-like site participates mediating carbohydrate response L-PK gene appears member c-myc family distinct MLTF.
