 Tumor suppressor genes effector pathways identified many dominantly heritable cancers, enabling efforts intervene early course disease. approach subject early intervention investigate gene expression patterns morphologically normal "one-hit" cells become hemizygous homozygous inherited mutant gene usually required tumor formation. Here, studied histologically non-transformed renal epithelial cells patients inherited disorders predispose renal tumors, including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC). controls, studied histologically normal cells non-cancerous renal epithelium patients sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Gene expression analyses VHLmut/wt TSC1/2mut/wt versus wild-type (WT) cells revealed transcriptomic alterations previously implicated transition precancerous renal lesions. example, gene expression changes VHLmut/wt cells consistent activation hypoxia response, associated, part, "Warburg effect". Knockdown remaining VHL mRNA using shRNA induced secondary expression changes, activation NFkappaB interferon pathways, fundamentally important development RCC. posit general pattern hereditary cancer predisposition, wherein haploinsufficiency VHL TSC1/2, potentially tumor susceptibility genes, sufficient promote development early lesions, cancer results inactivation remaining normal allele. gene expression changes identified related metabolic basis renal cancer may constitute suitable targets early intervention.
