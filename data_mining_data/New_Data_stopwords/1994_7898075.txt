 assessed ranolazine's potential reduce myocardial injury resulting 90-min occlusion 18-h reperfusion left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) anesthetized dogs. Ranolazine, putative antianginal agent, exhibited positive results variety experimental models associated ischemic myocardium. Previous studies demonstrated ranolazine possesses mechanism action involving increases amount active pyruvate dehydrogenase ischemia, suggesting compound may act promote glucose utilization. Ranolazine administered bolus 3.3 mg/kg, followed constant infusion 7.2 mg/kg/h 20 h. loading dose administered 30 min LCX occlusion. Control animals received appropriate volumes vehicles (loading infusion). Hemodynamics unchanged ranolazine vehicle groups. Three animals group excluded ventricular fibrillation (VF). difference degree ST segment change control ranolazine-treated groups time LCX occlusion. area risk (AAR) infarct 40.1 +/- 1.7 38.9 +/- 1.3% control-treated (n = 13) randolazine-treated (n = 8) animals, respectively (p = 0.631). Myocardial infarct size (IS) 31.7 +/- 5.2 36.6 +/- 8.5% control ranolazine-treated animals, respectively (p = 0.603). significant changes observed plasma content enzymatic markers 0.5, 2.0, 18.0 h reperfusion. results vivo study indicate ranolazine provide protection injury regionally ischemic reperfused myocardium despite reported antiischemic activity.
