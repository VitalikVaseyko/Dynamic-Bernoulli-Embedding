 cloned full-length cDNA rat-liver-type phosphofructokinase. similarities rat liver-type phosphofructokinase mRNA human mouse counterparts 94% 99% amino acid sequences 88% 94% nucleotide sequences coding regions, respectively. Rat liver-type phosphofructokinase mRNA expressed tissues examined, level regulated tissue-specifically. nutritional hormonal regulations mRNA liver examined comparison two key glycolytic enzymes, glucokinase L-type pyruvate kinase. level liver-type phosphofructokinase mRNA essentially unchanged starvation (72 h) diabetes. mRNA level also change significantly refeeding starved rats high carbohydrate diet, treating diabetic ones insulin. results suggested rat liver-type phosphofructokinase mRNA liver control diet insulin, contrast glucokinase L-type pyruvate kinase.
