 Glucose regulates programs gene expression orchestrate changes cellular phenotype several metabolically active tissues. Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) binding partner, Mlx, mediate glucose-regulated gene expression binding carbohydrate response elements target genes, prototypical glucose-responsive gene, liver-type pyruvate kinase (Pklr). c-Myc also required glucose response Pklr gene, although relationship c-Myc ChREBP defined. describe molecular events glucose-mediated activation Pklr determine effects decreasing activity abundance c-Myc process. Time-course chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed set transcription factors [hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha, HNF4alpha, RNA polymerase II (Pol II)] constitutively resident Pklr promoter, relative enrichment acetylated histones 3 4 region gene. Glucose affect HNF1alpha binding acetylation histones H3 H4. contrast, glucose promoted recruitment ChREBP c-Myc increased occupancy HNF4alpha RNA Pol II, coincident glucose-mediated increase transcription determined nuclear run-on assay. Depletion c-Myc activity using small molecule inhibitor (10058-F4/1RH) abolished glucose-mediated recruitment HNF4alpha, ChREBP, RNA Pol II, without affecting basal gene expression, histone acetylation, HNF1alpha basal HNF4alpha occupancy. activation recruitment ChREBP several glucose-responsive genes blocked 1RH, indicating general necessity c-Myc process.
