 Primary cultures adult rat hepatocytes kept 46 h either insulin ('insulin cells') glucagon ('glucagon cells') dominant hormone different oxygen concentrations 13% (v/v) O2 mimicking arterial 4% hepatovenous levels. Thereafter metabolic rates measured 2 h period ('overall long-term O2 effects') different ('short-term O2 effects') oxygen concentration. differences two effects 'intrinsic long-term O2 effects' derived. Glycolysis, measured 'insulin-cells', stimulated low O2 levels. threefold faster cells cultured tested 4% O2 compared cells cultured tested 13% O2, indicating overall long-term effect. Glycolysis twofold faster cells cultured tested 4% O2 compared cells cultured 4% O2 tested 13% O2, demonstrating short-term effect. Glycolysis 1.5-fold faster cells cultured tested 4% O2 compared cells cultured 13% O2 tested 4% O2, showing intrinsic long-term effect. difference roughly parallel difference levels glucokinase pyruvate kinase. Gluconeogenesis, measured 'glucagon cells', stimulated high O2 levels. Similar glycolysis overall long-term, short-term intrinsic long-term effects could distinguished. intrinsic long-term effects determined 13% O2 corresponded 1.5-fold stimulation paralleled difference phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase levels. present results show physiological oxygen concentrations also modulate hepatic carbohydrate metabolism long-term effects O2 gradient liver parenchyma thus contributes metabolic differences periportal perivenous hepatocytes vivo.
