 Thermoanaerobium brockii shown catabolize glucose via Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway ethanol, acetic acid, H(2)-CO(2), lactic acid. Radioactive tracer studies, employing specifically labeled [(14)C]glucose, demonstrated significant fermentation (14)CO(2) C-3 C-4 substrate exclusively. extracts contained sufficient levels activity (expressed micromoles per minute per milligram protein 40 degrees C) assign catabolic role following enzymes: glucokinase, 0.40; fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase, 0.23; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1.73; pyruvate kinase, 0.36; lactate dehydrogenase (fructose-1,6-diphosphate activated), 0.55; pyruvate dehydrogenase (coenzyme acetylating), 0.53; hydrogenase, 3.3; phosphotransacetylase, 0.55; acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (coenzyme acetylating), 0.15; ethanol dehydrogenase, 1.57; acetate kinase, 1.50. pyridine nucleotide-linked oxidoreductases examined specific nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, except ethanol dehydrogenase displayed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-linked activities. Fermentation product balances cell growth yields supported glucose catabolic pathway described. Representative balanced end product yields (in moles per mole glucose fermented) were: ethanol, 0.94; l-lactate, 0.84; acetate, 0.20; CO(2), 1.31; H(2), 0.50. Growth yields 16.4 g cells per mole glucose demonstrated. growth end product yields varied significantly accordance specific medium composition incubation time.
