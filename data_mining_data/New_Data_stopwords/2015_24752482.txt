 Streptomyces albulus PD-1 co-produce antimicrobial homo-polymers poly(epsilon-lysine) (epsilon-PL) poly(L-diaminopropionic acid) (PDAP). study, novel feeding strategy citric acid coupled glucose-(NH4)2SO4 feeding employed S. albulus PD-1. pH culture broth dropped 4.0, feeding solution added continuously maintain concentrations glucose citric acid 10 4 g L(-1), respectively. result, final concentration epsilon-PL increased 21.7 29.7 g L(-1) final concentration PDAP decreased 4.8 3.2 g L(-1). Assays intracellular nucleotide levels key enzyme activities performed elucidate underlying regulation mechanism. addition citric acid increased NADH/NAD(+) ratio decreased intracellular ATP level; meanwhile, activities pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase isocitrate dehydrogenase decreased aspartate aminotransferase activity increased. Therefore, deduced citric acid feeding resulted metabolic flux redistribution node phosphoenolpyruvate; metabolic pathway phosphoenolpyruvate directed tricarboxylic acid cycle weakened thus PDAP production inhibited. hand, metabolic pathway phosphoenolpyruvate directed oxaloacetate L-aspartate enhanced, thereby improving epsilon-PL production. fermentation strategy may potentially useful epsilon-PL production effectively inhibit formation by-products, PDAP.
