 3-Bromopyruvic acid (3-BP) promising anticancer compound strong inhibitor glycolytic enzymes, especially glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Warburg effect means malignant cells much dependent glycolysis normal cells. Potential complications anticancer therapy 3-BP side effects due interaction normal cells, especially erythrocytes. Transport cells critical 3-BP intracellular effects. aim study kinetic characterization 3-BP transport human erythrocytes. 3-BP uptake erythrocytes linear within first 3 min pH-dependent. transport rate decreased increasing pH range 6.0-8.0. Km Vm values 3-BP transport 0.89 mM 0.94 mmol/(l cells x min), respectively. transport inhibited competitively pyruvate significantly inhibited DIDS, SITS, 1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Flavonoids also inhibited 3-BP transport: potent inhibition found luteolin quercetin.
