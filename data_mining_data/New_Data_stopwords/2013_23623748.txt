 WNT signaling controls many biological processes including cell differentiation metazoans. However, WNT reprograms cell identity well understood. investigated potential role cellular metabolism WNT-induced osteoblast differentiation. WNT3A induces aerobic glycolysis known Warburg effect increasing level key glycolytic enzymes. metabolic regulation requires LRP5 beta-catenin mediated mTORC2-AKT signaling downstream RAC1. Suppressing WNT3A-induced metabolic enzymes impairs osteoblast differentiation vitro. Deletion Lrp5 mouse, decreases postnatal bone mass, reduces mTORC2 activity glycolytic enzymes bone cells lowers serum lactate levels. Conversely, mice expressing mutant Lrp5 causes high bone mass exhibit increased glycolysis bone. Thus, WNT-LRP5 signaling promotes bone formation part direct reprogramming glucose metabolism. Moreover, regulation cellular metabolism may represent general mechanism contributing wide-ranging functions WNT proteins.
