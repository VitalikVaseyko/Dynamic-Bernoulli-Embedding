 show volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced rhizospheric strains Pseudomonas fluorescens B-4117 Serratia plymuthica IC1270 may act inhibitors cell-cell communication quorum-sensing (QS) network mediated N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules produced various bacteria, including strains Agrobacterium, Chromobacterium, Pectobacterium Pseudomonas. quorum-quenching effect observed AHL-producing bacteria treated VOCs emitted strains B-4117 IC1270 dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), major volatile produced strain IC1270. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed treatment strains Pseudomonas chlororaphis 449, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Ps. fluorescens 2-79 VOCs emitted strain IC1270 DMDS drastically decreases amount AHLs produced bacteria. Volatile organic compounds produced Ps. chlororaphis 449 able suppress QS-induction activity, suggesting negative interaction VOCs AHL molecules strain. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed treatment Ps. chlororaphis 449 VOCs emitted cells IC1270, B-4117 449 itself, DMDS, leads significant suppression transcription AHL synthase genes phzI csaI. Thus, along AHLs, bacterial volatiles might considered another type signal molecule involved microbial communication rhizosphere.
