 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis, observation known Warburg effect. Recently, studies deciphered role oncogenes tumor suppressor genes regulating Warburg effect. Furthermore, mutations glycolytic enzymes identified various cancers highlight importance Warburg effect molecular cellular level. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) non-coding RNAs posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression dysregulated pathogenesis various types human cancers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) miRNA genes may affect miRNA biogenesis, processing, function, stability provide additional complexity pathogenesis cancer. Moreover, mutations miRNA target sequences target mRNAs affect expression. METHODS: silico analysis cataloguing polymorphisms miRNA genes target genes directly indirectly controlling aerobic glycolysis carried using different publically available databases. RESULTS: miRNA SNP2.0 database revealed several SNPs miR-126 miR-25 upstream downstream pre-miRNA flanking regions respectively inserted flanking regions miR-504 miR-451 fewest. miRNAs target genes control aerobic glycolysis indirectly. SNPs premiRNA genes found miR-96, miR-155, miR-25 miR34a miRNASNP. Dragon database polymorphic regulation miRNA genes (dPORE-miRNA) database revealed several SNPs modify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) creating new TFBS promoter regions selected miRNA genes analyzed dPORE-miRNA. CONCLUSIONS: results raise possibility integration SNP analysis miRNA genes studies metabolic adaptations cancer cells could provide greater understanding oncogenic mechanisms.
