 used novel microvolumetric technique based protein diffusion characterize subproteome muscle consists diffusible proteins, including involved cell metabolism. Muscle fiber segments mechanically demembranated mineral oil transferred drops relaxing solution. fiber segment depleted diffusible proteins, content drop residual segment analyzed one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins identified peptide mass fingerprinting quantified using purified protein standards. Ten abundant cytosolic proteins, distinguished ability readily diffuse skinned fiber, glycolytic enzymes whose concentrations ranged 2.6+/-1.0 g liter-1 (phosphoglucose isomerase) 12.8+/-1.1 g liter-1 fiber volume (pyruvate kinase). concentrations five abundant cytosolic proteins follows: glycogen phosphorylase, 6.0+/-2.3 g liter-1; phosphoglucose mutase, 2.2+/-0.2 g liter-1; adenylate kinase, 1.6+/-1.3 g liter-1; phosphocreatine kinase, 6.6+/-2.6 g liter-1; parvalbumin, 0.7+/-0.4 g liter-1. Given molecular weight subunit number enzyme, combined concentration 15 abundant cytosolic proteins 82.3 g liter-1; volume fraction 0.093. large volume fraction diffusible proteins favors nonspecific interactions associations, particularly glycolytic enzymes diffusible phosphocreatine kinase restricted I-band previous studies suggest. relative molar concentration glycolytic enzymes roughly consistent stoichiometry 1:2 enzymes catalyzing hexose triose sugar reactions, respectively, stoichiometry may favor metabolic channeling intermediates glycolysis. results indicate subcellular fractionation muscle proteins, cytosolic constituents distinguished ability diffuse readily demembranated cells, promising microvolumetric technique allows conclusions drawn native protein-protein interactions based concentration stoichiometry.
