 1. influence inorganic phosphate (P(i)) relationship ATP consumption mechanical performance isometric dynamic conditions investigated chemically skinned single fibres thin bundles rabbit psoas muscle. Myofibrillar ATPase activity measured photometrically enzymatic coupling regeneration ATP oxidation NADH. NADH absorbance 340 nm determined inside miniature (4 microliters) measuring chamber. 2. ATP consumption due isovelocity shortenings measured range 0.0625 1 L0 s-1(L0: fibre length previous shortening, corresponding sarcomere length 2.64 microns), solutions without added P(i) 30 mM P(i). get estimate amount ATP utilized shortening phase, quick releases various amplitudes also performed. 3. quick releases, sufficiently large force dropped zero, extra ATP hydrolysed largely independent amplitude release period unloaded shortening. extra amount, isometric ATP turnover, corresponded 0.7 0.5 ATP molecules per myosin head 0 30 mM P(i), respectively. 4. ATP turnover isovelocity shortenings higher isometric turnover increased increasing shortening velocity 2.7 times isometric value. low moderate velocities shortening (< 0.5 L0 s-1), P(i) reduced ATP turnover isovelocity shortening isometric ATP turnover similar extent, i.e. decrease 77% 0 30 mM added P(i). 5. extra ATP turnover isometric value, resulting isovelocity shortenings studied different speeds, proportional power output preparation, absence presence added [P(i)]. 6. effect shortening velocity [P(i)] energy turnover understood cross-bridge model consists detached, non- low-force-producing, force-producing state. model, mass action P(i) influences equilibrium force-producing non-or-low-force-producing cross-bridges, shortening enhances cross-bridge detachment attached states.
