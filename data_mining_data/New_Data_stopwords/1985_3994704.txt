 enzymes metabolites glycolytic pathway animal model cystic fibrosis (the chronically reserpine-treated rat) investigated. activities enzymes phosphofructokinase (P less 0.002), enolase (P less 0.03), pyruvate kinase (P less 0.005), lactate dehydrogenase (P less 0.009) decreased whereas activity glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase unaffected submandibular glands treated animals. metabolites, reserpine treatment resulted increased concentration glycogen (P less 0.0002) phosphoenolpyruvate (P less 0.001) decreased concentration pyruvate (P less 0.005) lactate (P less 0.002) glands. concentration glucose glycerate-2-phosphate unaffected. perchloric acid-soluble part proteins also increased (P less 0.0001) submandibular glands reserpine-treated animals, activity ribonuclease. findings point disturbance metabolism glucose possible acidosis submandibular glands animal model cystic fibrosis.
