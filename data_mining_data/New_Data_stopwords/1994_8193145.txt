 molecular structure rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, crystallized complex Mn2+, K+, pyruvate, solved 2.9-A resolution. Crystals employed investigation belonged space group P1 unit cell dimensions = 83.6 A, b = 109.9 A, c = 146.8 A, alpha = 94.9 degrees, beta = 93.6 degrees, gamma = 112.3 degrees. two tetramers asymmetric unit. structure solved molecular replacement, using search model coordinates tetramer pyruvate kinase cat muscle [Muirhead, H., Claydon, D. A., Barford, D., Lorimer, C. G., Fothergill-Gilmore, L. A., Schiltz, E., & Schmitt, W. (1986) EMBO J.5, 475-481]. amino acid sequence derived cDNA coding enzyme rabbit muscle fit electron density. rabbit cat muscle enzymes approximately 94% sequence identity, folding patterns expected nearly identical. are, however, three regions topological models cat rabbit pyruvate kinases differ. Mn2+ coordinates protein carboxylate side chains Glu 271 Asp 295. two residues strictly conserved known pyruvate kinases. addition, density Mn2+ connected pyruvate, consistent chelation carboxylate oxygen carbonyl oxygen substrate. epsilon-NH2 Lys 269 OH Thr 327 lie either side methyl group bound pyruvate. Spherical electron density, assigned K+, located within well-defined pocket four oxygen ligands contributed carbonyl oxygen Thr 113, gamma Ser 76, delta 1 Asn 74, delta 2 Asp 112. interaction Asp 112 side chains Lys 269 Arg 72 may mediate, indirectly, monovalent cation effects activity.
