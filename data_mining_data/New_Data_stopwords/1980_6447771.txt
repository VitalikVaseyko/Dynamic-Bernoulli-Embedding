 following aspects investigated 10 patients affected Huntington's disease )HD): --extensive haematological investigations; --red cell enzyme activities level important glycolytic intermediate compounds; --protein, lipid carbohydrate composition erythrocyte membrane membrane polarity; --effects vitro aging red cell membranes. Lack 4.5 protein band SDS-PAGE 14-fold decrease membrane-bound catalase found vitro aged red cells 10 HD patients examined. Na+ + K+ATPase slightly higher normal patients. Red cells 5 8 patients showed decrease reduced glutathione phosphoenolpyruvate levels and/or increase hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase glutathione reductase activities. haematological investigations, protein lipid carbohydrate composition fresh red cells, membrane polypeptide aggregates membrane polarity evaluated microspectrofluorometric analysis normal.
