 phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway essential many biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, angiogenesis, pathophysiological conditions. Although 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) primary activator Akt plasma membrane, optimal activation mechanism remains unclear. report adhesion molecule IgG-like domain 2 (AMIGO2) novel scaffold protein regulates PDK1 membrane localization Akt activation. Loss AMIGO2 endothelial cells (ECs) led apoptosis inhibition angiogenesis Akt inactivation. Amino acid residues 465-474 AMIGO2 directly bind PDK1 pleckstrin homology domain. synthetic peptide containing AMIGO2 465-474 residues abrogated AMIGO2-PDK1 interaction Akt activation. Moreover, effectively suppressed pathological angiogenesis murine tumor oxygen-induced retinopathy models. results demonstrate AMIGO2 important regulator PDK1-Akt pathway ECs suggest interference PDK1-AMIGO2 interaction might novel pharmaceutical target designing Akt pathway inhibitor.
