 BACKGROUND: Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) inherited hemolytic anemia documented Abyssinian Somali breeds well random bred domestic shorthair cats. disease results mutations PKLR, gene encoding regulatory glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK). Multiple isozymes produced tissue-specific differential processing PKLR mRNA. Perturbation PK decreases erythrocyte longevity resulting anemia. Additional signs include: severe lethargy, weakness, weight loss, jaundice, abdominal enlargement. domestic cats, PK deficiency autosomal recessive mode inheritance high variability onset severity clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Sequence analysis PKLR revealed intron 5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) position 304 concordant disease phenotype Abyssinian Somali cats. Located 53 nucleotides upstream exon 6 splice site, cats SNP produce liver blood processed mRNA 13 bp deletion 3' end exon 5. frame-shift mutation creates stop codon amino acid position 248 exon 6. frequency intronic SNP 14,179 American European cats representing 38 breeds, 76 western random bred cats 111 cats unknown breed 6.31% 9.35% restricted 15 groups carrying concordant SNP. CONCLUSIONS: PK testing recommended Bengals, Egyptian Maus, La Perms, Maine Coon cats, Norwegian Forest cats, Savannahs, Siberians, Singapuras, addition Abyssinians Somalis well new breeds using afore mentioned breeds crossing development programs.
