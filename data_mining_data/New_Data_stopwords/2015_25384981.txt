 Cystic fibrosis (CF) due folding defect CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. common mutation, DeltaF508, prevents CFTR trafficking apical plasma membrane. show activation PDK1/SGK1 signaling pathway C4-ceramide (C4-CER), non-toxic small molecule, functionally corrects trafficking defect cultured CF cells primary epithelial cell explants CF patients. mechanism C4-CER action involves series mutual autophosphorylation phosphorylation events PDK1 SGK1. Detailed mechanistic studies indicate C4-CER initially induces autophosphorylation SGK1 Ser(422). SGK1[Ser(P)(422)] C4-CER coincidently bind PDK1 permit PDK1 autophosphorylate Ser(241). PDK1[Ser(P)(241)] phosphorylates SGK1[Ser(P)(422)] Thr(256) generate fully activated SGK1[Ser(422), Thr(P)(256)]. SGK1[Ser(P)(422),Thr(P)(256)] phosphorylates inactivates E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. DeltaF508-CFTR thus free traffic plasma membrane. Importantly, C4-CER-mediated activation PDK1 SGK1 independent PI3K/Akt/mammalian target rapamycin signaling pathway. Physiologically, C4-CER significantly increases maturation stability DeltaF508-CFTR (t(1/2) approximately 10 h), enhances cAMP-activated chloride secretion, suppresses hypersecretion interleukin-8 (IL-8). suggest candidate drugs CF directed PDK1/SGK1 signaling pathway, C4-CER, provide novel therapeutic strategy life-limiting disorder affects one child, average, day.
