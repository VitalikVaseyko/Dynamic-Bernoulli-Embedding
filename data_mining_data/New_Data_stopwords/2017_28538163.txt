 autoimmune diseases, decade-long defect self-tolerance eventually leads clinically relevant, tissue-destructive inflammatory disease. pathogenic potential chronic persistent immune responses pre-clinical clinical phase ultimately linked bioenergetic fitness innate adaptive immune cells. Chronic immune cell stimulation, high cellular turn-over, structural damage host tissue maladaptive wound healing, require reliable supply nutrients, oxygen, biosynthetic precursors. Here, use model system rheumatoid arthritis (RA) discuss immunometabolism vantage point T-cells macrophages encounter fundamentally different metabolic stress scenarios RA host. outline general principle insufficient nutrient supply, well nutrient excess generate cellular stress responses guide immune function. ATP(low), NADPH(high), ROS(low) T-cells hyperproliferate forced premature senescence. ATP(high), ROS(high) macrophages dimerize glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase amplify STAT3-dependent inflammatory effector functions. corollary model simple nutraceutical interventions insufficient re-educate immune system RA. Instead, interference cell-type-exclusive differentiation-stage-dependent metabolic setpoints needed reprogram arthritogenic pathways.
