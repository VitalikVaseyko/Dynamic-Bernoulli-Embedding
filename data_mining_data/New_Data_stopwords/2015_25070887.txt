 long known pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) released circulation cancer patients. PKM2 levels patients suggested diagnostic marker many types cancers. However, known PKM2 released blood, whether circulating PKM2 physiological function(s) tumor progression. report, demonstrate PKM2 blood facilitates tumor growth promoting tumor angiogenesis. experiments show PKM2 promotes tumor angiogenesis increasing endothelial cell proliferation, migration, cell-ECM adhesion. dimeric PKM2 possess activity promoting tumor angiogenesis, consistent observations PKM2 circulation cancer patients dimer form.
