 effects anemia-inducing substance (AIS), found plasma tumor-bearing subjects, red blood cells (RBC) cellular immunity examined. results obtained may summarized follows: 1) osmotic resistance deformability RBC decreased patients terminal cancer. 2) Normal human RBC made less deformable membrane made fragile treatment cachectic plasma patients, changes physical properties irreversible. 3) Energy metabolism RBC affected AIS, is, ATP concentration pyruvate kinase activity RBC lowered transmembrane glucose influx suppressed. 4) AIS removed cachectic plasma repeated adsorption normal RBC, inhibitory effect cellular immunity lessened AIS removed. 5) AIS detected cachectic RBC membrane, monocytes, tumor tissue indirect immunofluorescence assay using rabbit anti-AIS antibody prepared us. observations suggest strongly tumor-derived AIS appears blood patients terminal cancer, shows cytotoxicity RBC immunologically competent cells, plays role pathogenesis cancer cachexy.
