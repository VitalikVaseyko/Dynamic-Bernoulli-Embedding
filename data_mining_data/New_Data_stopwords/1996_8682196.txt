 Crystallographic mutagenesis studies unravelled general features allosteric transition mechanism pyruvate kinase. enzyme displays dramatic conformational change going T- R-state. three domains forming subunit tetrameric enzyme undergo simultaneous concerted rotations, way subunit domain interfaces modified. mechanism unprecedented since tetrameric allosteric enzymes, characterised atomic resolution, least one domain subunit interfaces remains unchanged T- R-state transition. molecular mechanism allosteric regulation proposed provides rationale effect single site mutations observed human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase associated congenital anaemia.
