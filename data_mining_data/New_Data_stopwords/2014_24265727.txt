 Lung cancer cause cancer-related deaths Western world. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts almost 80% lung cancers, 50% type adenocarcinomas. cellular molecular origin type lung cancer remains elusive mechanisms poorly known. known K-Ras mutations appear 25-30% lung adenocarcinomas best known single mutation related lung cancers. Recently, suggested putative population mouse bronchioalveolar stem cells could considered cell origin adenocarcinomas. cells expanded early stages lung tumorigenesis. isolated population mouse bronchioalveolar stem cells induced transformation oncogenic K-RasG12. Different approaches shown intracellular network linking p38alpha MAPK PI3K-Pdk1 pathways involved regulating survival malignant progression transformed cells. Absence p38alpha catalytic activity leads Pdk1 activation (independent Akt Erk activity), enhancing survival proliferation malignant lung cancer cells. specifically selects high Sca-1/Sox9 cells harbour stronger colonizing potential, maintain capacity produce secondary tumors serial transplantations.
