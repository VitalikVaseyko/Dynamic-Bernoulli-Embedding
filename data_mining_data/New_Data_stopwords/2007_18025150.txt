 Despite importance phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) B-cell development, activation mechanism still remains elusive. study, show deletion BCAP CD19 leads almost complete block BCR-mediated Akt activation severe defects generation immature mature B cells. YXXM motifs BCAP CD19 crucial regulating B-cell development mutation motifs abrogated ability induce BCR-mediated Akt activation well promote B-cell development. Furthermore, developmental defect CD19(-/-)BCAP(-/-) B cells partly relieved introducing constitutively active form PI3K PDK1. Together, data suggest BCAP CD19 complementary roles BCR-mediated PI3K activation, thereby, least part, contributing B-cell development.
