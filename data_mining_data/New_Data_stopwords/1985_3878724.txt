 pH profiles determined reactions catalyzed pyruvate kinase pyruvate MgATP phosphoenolpyruvate MgADP. V, V/KMgATP, V/Kpyruvate decrease pK 8.3 one 9.2. group pK = 8.3 probably lysine removes proton pyruvate enolization, pK 9.2 water coordinated enzyme-bound Mg2+. fact pK shows three pH profiles shows pyruvate forms predominantly second sphere complex cannot replace hydroxide form inner sphere complex results enolization subsequent phosphorylation. basis displacement pK acid-base catalytic group V/K profile, phosphoenolpyruvate sticky substrate, reacting give pyruvate approximately 5 times faster dissociates. V/K profile slow substrate phosphoenol-alpha-ketobutyrate shows pK 8.3 acid-base catalytic group correct position, group must protonated donate proton intermediate enolate following phosphoryl transfer. secondary phosphate pK substrate seen V/K profile well pKi profile phosphoglycolate (but glycolate O-sulfate oxalate), showing preference trianion binding. chemical mechanism natural substrates thus appears involve phosphoryl transfer MgADP Mg2+-bound enolate metal coordination enolate serving make good leaving group.
