 Abnormal glucose metabolism mediated pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) fuels cancer overgrowth propagation. However, expression oncogenic roles oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains incompletely known. Here, aimed investigate expression PKM2, prognostic values oncogenic functions using 7,12-dimethyl-1,2-bezan-tracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch SCC model, primary OSCC specimens well vitro cellular assays. found DMBA-induced OSCC model, negative PKM2 expression commonly observed normal epithelial, PKM2 abundance detected hyperplasia, dysplasia SCC. Overexpression PKM2 major fraction OSCC significantly associated tumor size (P = 0.027), cervical node metastasis (P = 0.004) clinical stages (P = 0.000). Patients increased PKM2 remarkably reduced overall disease-free survival. Multivariate survival analysis revealed PKM served critical independent prognostic factor patients' overall survival. Furthermore, impaired cell proliferation migration, reduced apoptosis detected upon PKM2 knockdown HN4 HN12 cells. Taken together, findings reveal PKM2 critically involved OSCC initiation progression probably promoting cell proliferation migration well reducing apoptosis. overexpression correlates aggressive clinicopathological features poor patients' outcome.
