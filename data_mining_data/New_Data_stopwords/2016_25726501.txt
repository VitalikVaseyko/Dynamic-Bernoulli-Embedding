 BACKGROUND: Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury one main lesions liver transplantation. study aims detect hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha protects transplanted liver I/R injury promoting glucose metabolism decrease mitochondrial injury apoptosis rat model. METHODS: rats given treatment 90 min non-lethal hypoxic preconditioning induce increase HIF-1alpha expression. autologous orthotopic liver transplantation model used imitate liver I/R injury. RESULTS: Hypoxic-induced HIF-1alpha detected increase liver tissue 90-minute hypoxic environment (HP vs. Ctrl, *P<0.001). operation, expression HIF-1alpha liver tissue also stayed high level. 24h operation, several genes promoted, levels HK-2 (HP vs. AT, 24h, *P=0.004), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) (HP vs. AT, 24h, *P=0.003), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK-1) (HP vs. AT, 24h, *P=0.007), even NF-kappaB Erk pathways. TUNEL assay, apoptosis hypoxic preconditioning liver tissue decreased compared non-HP operative group 12h operation. expressions cleaved-caspase 3 (HP vs. AT, *P=0.0119) PARP (HP vs. AT, *P=0.0134) HP group also significantly lower group. CONCLUSION: hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha could promote glucose metabolism protect hepatocellular mitochondria damage. could useful way protect liver I/R injuries inflammatory injury, particularly promote recovery graft function.
