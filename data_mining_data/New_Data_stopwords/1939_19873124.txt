 Experiments using Warburg-Barcroft apparatus led following results conclusions: (1) Two yeasts three different media strikingly stimulated respiration minute amounts pantothenic acid. (2) Nine compounds (vitamins biologically important substances) tested found cases deficient G.M. yeast, lesser cases appreciable stimulative effect. Thiamin effective compounds. action shown different ways antagonistic pantothenic acid. (3) Liver extract (Lilly's Number 343) contains substances capable speeding respiration (and growth) much higher level seems possible known compounds. (4) Pantothenic acid found definite stimulative effect fermentation dialyzed maceration juice yeast. (5) likewise stimulated respiration apple potato tissue indications similar effect certain animal tissues obtained.
