 INTRODUCTION: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) oncogene attractive therapeutic target treatment HER2-addicted tumors. Although lapatinib, FDA-approved small-molecule HER2 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), represents significant therapeutic advancement treatment HER2+ breast cancers, responses lapatinib durable. Consequently, elucidation mechanisms acquired therapeutic resistance HER-directed therapies critical importance. METHODS: Using functional protein-pathway activation mapping strategy, along targeted genomic knockdowns applied series isogenic-matched pairs lapatinib-sensitive resistant cell lines, report unexpected mechanism acquired resistance lapatinib similar TKIs. RESULTS: signaling analysis revealed whereas HER2 appropriately inhibited lapatinib-resistant cells, EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation incompletely inhibited. Using targeted molecular knockdown approach interrogate causal molecular underpinnings EGFR-persistent activation, found lapatinib-resistant cells longer oncogene addicted HER2-HER3-PI3K signaling, seen parental lapatinib-sensitive cell lines, instead dependent heregulin (HRG)-driven HER3-EGFR-PI3K-PDK1 signaling axis. Two FDA-approved EGFR TKIs could overcome HRG-HER3-mediated activation EGFR, reverse lapatinib resistance. ability overcome EGFR-mediated acquired therapeutic resistance lapatinib demonstrated molecular knockdown EGFR treatment irreversible pan-HER TKI neratinib, blocked HRG-dependent phosphorylation HER3 EGFR, resulting apoptosis resistant cells. addition, whereas HRG reversed lapatinib-mediated antitumor effects parental HER2+ breast cancer cells, neratinib comparatively resistant effects HRG parental cells. Finally, showed HRG expression independent negative predictor clinical outcome HER2+ breast cancers, providing potential clinical relevance findings. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis acquired therapeutic resistance lapatinib identified new resistance mechanism based incomplete "leaky" inhibition EGFR lapatinib. selective pressure applied incomplete inhibition EGFR drug target resulted selection ligand-driven feedback sustained EGFR activation face constant exposure drug. Inadequate target inhibition driven ligand-mediated autocrine feedback loop may represent broader mechanism therapeutic resistance TKIs suggests adopting different strategy selecting effective TKIs advance clinic.
