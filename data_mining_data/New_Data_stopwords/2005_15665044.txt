 ERK MAP kinase-mediated contractile mechanism previously reported activated peroxide stretch bovine coronary arteries shown study present endothelium-denuded bovine pulmonary arteries subject regulation modulation cytosolic NAD(H) redox lactate dehydrogenase reaction. Although previous work identified acute PO2-dependent peroxide-mediated relaxation bovine pulmonary arteries exposure lactate, 30-min treatment 10 mM lactate enhanced ERK phosphorylation increased force generation 30 mM KCl. Hypoxia inhibited responses lactate. Increases ERK phosphorylation enhancement force generation lactate stretch attenuated presence inhibitors Nox oxidase (0.1 mM apocynin) ERK activation (10 microM PD-98059) 0.1 mM ebselen. Additionally, incubation pulmonary arteries 10 mM pyruvate lowered basal levels ERK phosphorylation, inhibited ERK phosphorylation enhancement force generation 30 mM KCl caused stretch. Treatment pulmonary arteries thiol oxidant diamide (1 microM) elicited appears peroxide-independent increase force ERK phosphorylation attenuated PD-98059. Thus pulmonary arteries possess peroxide-elicited contractile mechanism involving ERK MAP kinase, stimulated stretch regulated control Nox oxidase activity availability cytosolic NADH.
