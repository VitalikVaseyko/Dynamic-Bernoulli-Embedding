 BACKGROUND: important phenomenon observed glioma metabolism increased aerobic glycolysis tumor cells, generally referred Warburg effect. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2, previously showed induced lactic acid, key pathophysiological factor glioblastoma, leading increased invasion severe local immunosuppression proteolytic cleavage latency associated peptide. study tested hypothesis, lactate regulates TGF-beta2 expression glioma cell migration via induction Thrombospondin-1 (THBS-1), TGF-beta activating protein. METHODS: Lactate levels reduced knockdown LDH-A using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) competitive inhibition LDH-A sodium oxamate. Knockdown THBS-1 performed using specific siRNA. Western Blot, qRT-PCR, ELISA used investigate expression levels LDH-A, LDH-B, TGF-beta2 THBS-1. Migration cells examined Spheroid, Scratch Boyden Chamber assays. RESULTS: Knockdown LDH-A subsequent decrease lactate concentration leads reduced levels THBS-1 TGF-beta2 glioma cells. Lactate addition increases THBS-1 protein, leading increased activation TGF-beta2. Inhibition THBS-1 reduces TGF-beta2 protein migration glioma cells. Addition synthetic THBS-1 rescue reduced TGF-beta2 protein levels glioma cell migration siLDH-A treated cells. CONCLUSION: define regulatory cascade lactate, THBS-1 TGF-beta2, leading enhanced migration glioma cells. results demonstrate specific interaction tumor metabolism migration provide better understanding mechanisms underlying glioma cell invasion.
