 modeled energy metabolism perfused rat heart order elucidate interaction physiological biochemical control mechanisms. model includes glycolysis, Krebs cycle, related metabolism, contains 68 submodels individual enzymes transport mechanisms including cytosolic mitochondrial reactions. method model construction, relies heavily fitting observed situ behavior known algebraic rate laws isolated enzymes, data requirements necessary assumptions described. Simulation CO-induced anoxic preparation described detail. glycolysis increases sharply, due increased glucose uptake phosphorylase activation (there rapid interconversion b forms, active here); causes damped glycolytic oscillation originating glycogen-handling enzymes rather phosphofructokinase. behavior physiological consequences ATPase activity lactate permease exports lactate perfusate discussed.
