 BACKGROUND: therapeutic prognostic value glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase (PK) implicated variety cancers, roles treatment prognosis hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC) remain unclear. study, determined expression PKM2 impact biology clinical outcome human HC. METHODS: regulation function PKM2 HC pathogenesis evaluated using human tissues, molecular cell biology, animal models, prognostic significance determined according impact patient survival. RESULTS: found expression hexokinase 1 M2 splice isoform PK (PKM2) upregulated HC tissues expression correlated tumor recurrence outcome. PKM2 expression increased HC cases chronic cholangitis demonstrated isobaric tags relative absolute quantification. High PKM2 expression highly correlated high syndecan 2 (SDC2) expression neural invasion. PKM2 downregulation led decrease SDC2 expression. Treatment metformin markedly suppressed PKM2 SDC2 expression transcriptional posttranscriptional levels inhibited HC cell proliferation tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: PKM2 regulates neural invasion HC cells least part via regulation SDC2. Inhibition PKM2 SDC2 expression contributes therapeutic effect metformin HC. Therefore, PKM2 independent prognostic factor potential therapeutic target human HC.
