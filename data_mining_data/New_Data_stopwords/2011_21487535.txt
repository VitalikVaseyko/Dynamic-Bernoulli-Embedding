 proposed select oligomers polymer d-lactic acid (PDLA) form stereocomplex l-lactate vivo, producing lactate deficiency tumor cells. cancer cells utilize transport lactate maintain electrical neutrality may cease multiply die lactate trapping, cancer cells benefit utilization extracellular lactate may impaired. Intracellular trapping lactate produces different physiology inhibition LDH cell loses option shuttling pyruvate alternative pathway produce anion. Conjugated stains fluorescent probes, PDLA oligomers may agent diagnosis tissue lactate possibly cell differentiation biopsy specimens. Preliminary experimental evidence presented confirming PDLA high concentrations cytotoxic l-lactate forms presumed stereocomplex PDLA. Future work directed isolation biologically active oligomers PDLA.
