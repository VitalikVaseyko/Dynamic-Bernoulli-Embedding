 Investigation patient complaining exercise-induced dark urine, pain, stiffness tenderness skeletal muscle revealed findings characteristic McArdle's disease. dark urine attributable excretion myoglobin, ischemic exercise test failed demonstrate usual rise fall blood lactate pyruvate. Enzyme assays skeletal muscle showed absence phosphorylase, slight increase phosphorylase b kinase slight decrease phosphoglucomutase. Chemical histochemical analyses demonstrated increase skeletal muscle glycogen content enlargement muscle cells. abnormality liver glycogen metabolism found. absence specific therapy, effective practical form treatment reduction exercise threshold symptoms.
