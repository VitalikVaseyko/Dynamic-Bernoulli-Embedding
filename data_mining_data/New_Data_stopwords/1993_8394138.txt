 normal rat hepatocytes primary culture level mRNA encoding key gluconeogenic enzyme phospho enol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) increased cyclic AMP analogue, chlorophenylthio cyclic AMP (cpt cAMP), response reversed insulin. protein-phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid diminished stimulatory effects cpt cAMP PEPCK mRNA. Protein kinase remained fully active presence okadaic acid, therefore, insulin-mimetic actions okadaic acid localised site subsequent initial protein kinase activation. Insulin produced decrease PEPCK mRNA expression similar okadaic acid extent mechanism (i.e., lack change protein kinase activation). effects okadaic acid PEPCK mRNA amount additive insulin effects insulin abolished okadaic acid. data suggest okadaic acid insulin may interact cAMP regulation PEPCK gene expression common site. mechanisms may attained discussed relation known control specific protein kinases protein phosphatases insulin okadaic acid importance protein phosphorylation state regulation gene-transcriptional processes.
