 Cancer cell survival metastasis dependent metabolic reprogramming capable increasing resistance oxidative energetic stress. Targeting two processes crucial cancer progression. Herein, describe role microRNA-661 (miR661) epigenetic regulator colon cancer (CC) cell metabolism. MicroR661 induces global increase reactive oxygen species, specifically mitochondrial superoxide anions, appears mediated decreased carbohydrate metabolism pentose phosphate pathway, higher dependency mitochondrial respiration. MicroR661 overexpression non-metastatic human CC cells induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, reduced tolerance metabolic stress. seems general effect miR661 CC, since metastatic CC cell metabolism also compromised upon miR661 overexpression. propose hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase M2 two key players related observed metabolic reprogramming. Finally, clinical relevance miR661 expression levels stage-II III CC patients discussed. conclusion, propose miR661 potential modulator redox metabolic homeostasis CC.
