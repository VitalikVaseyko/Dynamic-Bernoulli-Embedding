 study performed determine effects dietary perilla oil, n-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) source, hepatic lipogenesis possible mechanism lowering triacylglycerol (TG) levels. Male Sprague-Dawley rats trained 3-hour feeding protocol fed one five semipurified diets follows: 1% (w/w) corn oil control diet, one four diets supplemented 10% beef tallow, corn oil, perilla oil, fish oil. Two separate experiments performed compare effects feeding periods, 4 weeks 4 days. Hepatic plasma TG levels decreased rats fed perilla oil fish oil diets, compared corn oil beef tallow diets. activities hepatic lipogenic enzymes fatty acid synthase (FAS), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme suppressed fish oil, perilla oil, corn oil-fed groups, effect significant fish oil-fed group. Also, activities glycolytic enzymes, glucokinase, L-pyruvate kinase showed similar trend lipogenic enzymes. activity FAS, key regulatory enzyme lipogenesis, positively correlated hepatic plasma TG levels reduced significantly perilla oil-fed group compared corn oil-fed group. addition, FAS activity negatively correlated hepatic microsomal content EPA DHA. conclusion, suppression FAS plays significant role hypolipidemic effects observed rats fed ALA rich perilla oil effects associated increase hepatic microsomal EPA DHA contents.
