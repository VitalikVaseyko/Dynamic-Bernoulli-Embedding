 Starvation yeast cultures limited auxotrophic requirements results glucose wasting failure achieve prompt cell-cycle arrest compared starvation basic natural nutrients like phosphate sulfate. measured survival yeast auxotrophs upon starvation different nutrients found substantial differences: deprived leucine uracil, viability declined exponentially half-life <2 days, whereas strains deprived phosphate sulfate, half-life approximately 10 days. survival rates nongrowing auxotrophs deprived uracil leucine depended carbon source available starvation, independent carbon source prior growth. performed enrichment procedure mutants suppress lethality auxotrophy starvation. repeatedly found loss-of-function mutations number functionally related genes. Mutations PPM1, methylates protein phosphatase 2A, target rapamycin (TOR1) characterized further. Deletion PPM1 almost completely suppressed rapid lethality substantially suppressed glucose wasting starvation leucine uracil. Suppression deletion TOR1 less complete. suggest that, similar Warburg effect observed tumor cells, starving yeast auxotrophs wastes glucose consequence failure conserved growth control pathways. Furthermore, suggest results condition-dependent chronological lifespan important implications interpretation design studies chronological aging.
