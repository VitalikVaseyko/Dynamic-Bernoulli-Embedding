 Yeast mutants blocked different steps glycolytic pathways used study inactivation several gluconeogenic enzymes upon addition sugars. phosphorylation sugars appears requisite inactivation fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase inactivated fructose mutants lacking hexokinase. normal inactivation elicited glucose mutant lacking phosphofructokinase indicates process require metabolism sugar beyond hexose monophosphates. possible role ATP inactivation process suggested.
