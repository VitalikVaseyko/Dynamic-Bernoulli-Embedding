 Autophagy, lysosome-mediated catabolic process, contributes maintenance intracellular homeostasis cellular response metabolic stress. yeast, genes essential execution autophagy defined, including autophagy-related gene 1 (ATG1), kinase responsible initiation autophagy downstream target rapamycin. investigate role mammalian Atg1 homologs, uncoordinated family member (unc)-51-like kinase 1 2 (ULK1 ULK2), autophagy generating mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) doubly deficient ULK1 ULK2. found ULK1/2 required autophagy response amino acid deprivation autophagy induced deprivation glucose inhibition glucose metabolism. ULK1/2-independent autophagy simple result bioenergetic compromise failed induced AMP-activated protein kinase activators 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside phenformin. Instead found autophagy induction upon glucose deprivation correlated rise cellular ammonia levels caused elevated amino acid catabolism. Even complete medium, ammonia induced autophagy WT Ulk1/2(-/-) MEFs Atg5-deficient MEFs. autophagy response ammonia abrogated cell-permeable form pyruvate resulting scavenging excess ammonia pyruvate conversion alanine. Thus, although ULK1 and/or ULK2 required autophagy response following deprivation nitrogenous amino acids, autophagy response enhanced amino acid catabolism induced deprivation glucose direct exposure ammonia require ULK1 and/or ULK2. Together, data suggest autophagy provides cells mechanism adapt nitrogen deprivation also nitrogen excess.
