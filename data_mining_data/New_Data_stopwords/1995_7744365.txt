 isolated peptides bound HLA-DR4, DR53 molecules obtained HLA homozygous cell line cells, EBV-Wa (DRB1*0405, DRB4*0101), determined amino acid sequences peptides. Amino acid sequences 19 peptides obtained identified peptide fragments known proteins. those, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2m), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) cathepsin C considered endogenously derived, transferrin apolipoprotein B-100 exogenous proteins. Peptides corresponding protein shared sequence amino terminal carboxy terminal protrusions. Based core sequences, putative DR4, DR53-binding motifs suggested Y----T/V--D Y----T--D.
