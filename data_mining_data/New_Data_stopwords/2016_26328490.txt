 Aerobic glycolysis established hallmark cancer. Neoplastic cells display increased glucose consumption corresponding increase lactate production compared normal cells. Aerobic glycolysis regulated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/ mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, well oncogenic transcription factors c-Myc hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). gamma-Tocotrienol natural isoform within vitamin E family compounds displays potent antiproliferative apoptotic activity wide range cancer cell types treatment doses little effect normal cell viability. Studies conducted determine effects gamma-tocotrienol aerobic glycolysis mouse +SA human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Treatment gamma-tocotrienol resulted dose-responsive inhibition +SA MCF-7 mammary tumor cell growth, induced relatively large reduction glucose utilization, intracellular ATP production extracellular lactate excretion. effects also associated large decrease enzyme expression levels involved regulating aerobic glycolysis, including hexokinase-II, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A. gamma-Tocotrienol treatment also associated corresponding reduction levels phosphorylated (active) Akt, phosphorylated (active) mTOR, c-Myc, HIF-1alpha glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1). summary, findings demonstrate antiproliferative effects gamma-tocotrienol mediated, least part, concurrent inhibition Akt/mTOR signaling, c-Myc expression aerobic glycolysis.
