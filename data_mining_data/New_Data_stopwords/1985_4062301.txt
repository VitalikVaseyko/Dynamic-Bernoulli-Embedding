 Aerobic anoxic variants pyruvate kinase (termed PK-aer PK-anx) hepatopancreas gastropod mollusc, Busycotypus canaliculatum, purified apparent homogeneity final specific activities 14 2.3 units/mg protein, respectively. enzymes homotetramers molecular weight. enzymes also showed equivalent affinities ADP (0.22 mM) similar affinities Mg2+, Mn2+, K+, NH4+. PK-aer PK-anx differed strongly, however, maximal enzyme velocity (Vmax 9-fold higher PK-aer), affinity P-enolpyruvate (PEP0.5 = 0.38 mM PK-aer 1.1 mM PK-anx), effects activators inhibitors enzymes. PK-aer much strongly stimulated fructose-1,6-P2 aspartate activators (a 19- 32-fold activation enzyme velocity subsaturating PEP levels versus 4.1- 2.6-fold activation PK-anx, respectively). K alpha fructose-1,6-P2 3-fold lower (0.16 microM) PK-aer PK-anx (0.48 microM), K alpha aspartate enzymes (1.5 mM). Activators decreased PEP0.5 (to 0.05 mM PK-aer 0.07 mM PK-anx), relieved inhibitions alanine, Mg ATP, ADP, Pi, and, added together, showed strong synergistic activation PK-aer (but PK-anx). kinetic differences PK-aer PK-anx similar dephosphorylated versus phosphorylated forms PK sources, including red muscle PK B. canaliculatum, indicate change enzyme form brought anaerobiosis may due enzyme phosphorylation. powerful activation hepatopancreas PK aspartate novel regulatory control enzyme.
