 membrane sensor protein, ArcB, recognizes anaerobic environments signals information cognate regulator, ArcA. vitro study presents process control signal-transduction phosphorylation. presence ATP, ArcB transmitter module undergoes autophosphorylation transfers phosphoryl group receiver module well ArcA receiver module. Results suggest phosphoryl group ArcB receiver module released intrinsic phosphatase activity. D-Lactate inhibits phosphatase activity removes phosphoaspartate groups receiver module ArcB, associated increase phosphorylation module leads activation transphosphorylation subsequently added phosphohistidine groups ArcB receiver module ArcA. similar effect also observed presence pyruvate, acetate, NADH. Conversely, non-phosphorylated ArcB receiver module completely inhibits intermolecular transphosphorylation. Thus, phosphorylation state ArcB receiver module controls signal transduction ArcB ArcA. Since intrinsic phosphatase activity inhibited cellular metabolites increasingly accumulate anaerobiosis, enzyme portion ArcB may involved sensing anaerobic environments cellular metabolites vivo.
