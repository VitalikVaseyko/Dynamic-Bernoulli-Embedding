 6 patients breast cancer - specimens primary tumor well one metastases available examination - demonstrated intratumoral intertumoral heterogeneity expression activity glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, enolase pyruvate kinase. Heterogeneity also existed isozyme composition pyruvate kinase. transition tumors towards normal surrounding breast tissue showed either sharp drop activity, gradual decrease activity, corresponding pushing margins infiltrative growth tumor demonstrated histologic examination specimens. Likewise, shift towards expression K isozyme pyruvate kinase breast cancer compared normal breast tissue could demonstrated.
