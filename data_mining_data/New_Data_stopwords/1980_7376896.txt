 ATP level pyruvate kinase (PK) activity measured red cells 21 dogs. obtained results are: ATP -- 732 +/- 197.3 mumoles/1 RBC, PK -- 919 +/- 452.3 mumoles/min/1 RBC. ATP level dog red cells significantly lower rabbit rat red cells (p less 0.05). Possible explanation low ATP level dog red cells discussed.
