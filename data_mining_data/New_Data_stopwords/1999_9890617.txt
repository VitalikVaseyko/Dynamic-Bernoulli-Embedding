 Erythrocyte deformability determined 500 clinical samples, found elevated conditions fetal-like red cells produced: aplastic anemia (3/3 cases), myelodysplastic syndromes, polycythemias, sickle cell anemia treatment hydroxyurea, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, recovery B12 deficiency. Elevated deformability observed neonatal erythrocytes, recovery transient erythroblastopenia childhood, fetal-like red cells known produced. Increased deformability appears feature fetal fetal-like red cells. Forty-eight cases enzymatically verified glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-PD) deficiency also examined. Thirty 32 G-6-PD(A-) individuals, including heterozygotes hemizygotes, exhibited increased deformability steady state. contrast, G-6-PD(Med) hemizygotes normal deformability. Increased deformability also found G-6-PD(Huron) (n=3), G-6-PD(Wayne) (n=4), triose phosphate isomerase deficiency (n=2), pyruvate kinase deficiency (n=2). elevated osmoscan found 90% female G-6-PD heterozygotes, affording simple screening test heterozygotes. Deformability remained high hemolytic episodes, older enzyme deficient cells removed circulation. four cases G-6-PD deficiency normal deformability, evidence co-existing hereditary spherocytosis found. combination conditions opposing effects deformability resulted nearly normal deformability. increased red cell deformability feature fetal erythrocytes, results suggest red cells many cases glycolytic enzyme deficiency fetal-like.
