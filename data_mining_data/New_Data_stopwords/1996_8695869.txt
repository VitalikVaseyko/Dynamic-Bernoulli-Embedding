 Rabbit erythrocytes progressively increasing age isolated using avidin-biotin affinity technique activity protein kinases enzymes analyzed cytosols membranes isolated cells. activities cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC), cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), casein kinase type II (CKI II) found undergo age-dependent decrease twofold fourfold 8-week lifespan cells. Membrane-associated tyrosine kinase showed little decrease, membrane-associated CKI showed dramatic eightfold decrease 8-week period. contrast, various cytosolic enzymes, including lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, acid phosphatase, showed change activity time period. Density-separated human erythrocytes showed qualitatively similar decreases cytosolic protein kinase activities densest fractions, contain oldest cells. results show aging erythrocytes undergo progressive loss protein kinases may adversely affect various cellular processes. age-dependent loss kinase activity reported one striking manifestations erythrocyte senescence yet reported.
