 Methylation CpG islands tumor suppressor gene prompter one characteristic abnormalities Helicobacter pylori (HP)-associated gastric carcinoma (GC). Here, investigated pathogenic molecular mechanisms underlying hypermethylation tumor suppressor genes HP induced GC development. found tumor suppressor genes hypermethylation, represented MGMT, positively correlated CagA clinical specimens, gastric tissues HP infected C57 mice GC cell lines transfected CagA treated HP infection. CagA enhanced PDK1 AKT interaction increased AKT phosphorylation. P-AKT subsequent activated NFkappaB, bound DNMT1 promoter increased expression. Finally, upregulated DNMT1 promoted tumor suppressor genes hypermethylation MGMT representative. conclusion, CagA increased tumor suppressor genes hypermethylation via stimulating DNMT1 expression AKT-NFkappaB pathway.
