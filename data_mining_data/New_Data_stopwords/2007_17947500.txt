 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) important regulator carbohydrate oxidation exercise, activity downregulated increase dietary fat. purpose study determine acute metabolic effects differential dietary fatty acids activation PDH complex (PDHa activity) rest onset moderate-intensity exercise. University-aged male subjects (n = 7) underwent two fat-loading trials spaced least 2 wk apart. Subjects consumed approximately 300 g saturated (SFA) n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) fat course 5 h. Following this, participants cycled 65% maximum oxygen uptake 15 min. Muscle biopsies taken following fat loading 1 min exercise. Plasma free fatty acids increased 0.15 +/- 0.07 0.54 +/- 0.19 mM 5 h SFA 0.11 +/- 0.04 0.35 +/- 0.13 mM n-6 PUFA significantly lower throughout n-6 PUFA trial. PDHa activity unchanged following fat loading increased onset exercise SFA trial, 1.18 +/- 0.27 2.16 +/- 0.37 mmol x min(-1) x kg wet wt(-1). effect negated n-6 PUFA trial (1.04 +/- 0.20 1.28 +/- 0.36 mmol x min(-1) x kg wet wt(-1)). PDH kinase unchanged trials, suggesting attenuation PDHa activity n-6 PUFA result changes concentrations intramitochondrial effectors, potentially intramitochondrial NADH Ca(2+). findings suggest attenuated PDHa activity contributes preferential oxidation n-6 PUFA moderate-intensity exercise.
