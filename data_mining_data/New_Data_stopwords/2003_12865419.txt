 Hepatocyte nuclear factors-3 (Foxa-1-3) winged forkhead transcription factors regulate gene expression liver pancreatic islets required normal metabolism. show Foxa-2 expressed preadipocytes induced de novo adipocytes genetic diet-induced rodent models obesity. preadipocytes Foxa-2 inhibits adipocyte differentiation activating transcription Pref-1 gene. Foxa-2 Pref-1 expression enhanced primary preadipocytes growth hormone, suggesting antiadipogenic activity growth hormone mediated Foxa-2. differentiated adipocytes Foxa-2 expression leads induction gene expression involved glucose fat metabolism, including glucose transporter-4, hexokinase-2, muscle-pyruvate kinase, hormone-sensitive lipase, uncoupling proteins-2 -3. Diet-induced obese mice haploinsufficiency Foxa-2 (Foxa-2+/-) develop increased adiposity compared wild-type littermates result decreased energy expenditure. Furthermore, adipocytes Foxa-2+/- mice exhibit defects glucose uptake metabolism. data suggest Foxa-2 plays important role physiological regulator adipocyte differentiation metabolism.
