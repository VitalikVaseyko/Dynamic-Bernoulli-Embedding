 BACKGROUND: long time cancer cells known increased uptake glucose metabolization glycolysis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) key regulatory enzyme pathway produce ATP oxidative level phosphorylation. Previously, reported GAPDH purified variety malignant tissues, normal tissues, strongly inactivated normal metabolite, methylglyoxal (MG). Molecular mechanism behind MG mediated GAPDH inhibition cancer cells well understood. METHODS: GAPDH purified Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells based enzymatic activity. GAPDH associated proteins EAC cells 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) induced mouse tumor tissue detected mass spectrometry analysis immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment, respectively. Interacting domains GAPDH associated proteins assessed silico molecular docking analysis. Mechanism MG mediated GAPDH inactivation cancer cells evaluated measuring enzyme activity, Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, IP mass spectrometry analyses. RESULT: Here, report GAPDH associated glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells also 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) induced mouse tumor tissue. Molecular docking analyses suggest C-terminal domain preference interaction GAPDH GPI. However, C N termini PKM2 might interacting C terminal domain GAPDH. Expression PKM2 GPI increased 3MC induced tumor compared normal tissue. presence 1 mM MG, association GAPDH PKM2 GPI perturbed, enzymatic activity GAPDH reduced 26.8 +/- 5 % 3MC induced tumor 57.8 +/- 2.3 % EAC cells. Treatment MG purified GAPDH complex leads glycation R399 residue PKM2 only, changes secondary structure protein complex. CONCLUSION: PKM2 may regulate enzymatic activity GAPDH. Increased enzymatic activity GAPDH tumor cells may attributed association PKM2 GPI. Association GAPDH PKM2 GPI could signature cancer cells. Glycation R399 PKM2 changes secondary structure GAPDH complex could one mechanisms GAPDH activity inhibited tumor cells MG.
