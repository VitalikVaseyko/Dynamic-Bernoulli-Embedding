 Thyroid hormone regulates metabolism transcriptional posttranscriptional mechanisms. integration mechanisms heart poorly understood. Therefore, investigated control substrate flux citric acid cycle (CAC) thyroid hormone using retrogradely perfused isolated hearts (n = 20) control (C) age-matched thyroidectomized rats (T). determined substrate flux fractional contributions (Fc) CAC 13C-NMR spectroscopy isotopomer analyses hearts perfused [1,3-(13)C]acetoacetic acid (0.17 mM), L-[3-(13)C]lactic acid (LAC, 1.2 mM), [U-13C]long-chain mixed free fatty acids (FFA, 0.35 mM), unlabeled glucose. hearts supplied triiodothyronine (T3, 10 nM; TT) 60 min. Prolonged hypothyroid state reduced myocardial oxygen consumption, although T3 produced significant change. Hypothyroidism reduced overall CAC(flux) selectively altered FFA(flux) among individual substrates, though LAC(flux) trended upward. T3 rapidly decreased lactate Fc flux. 13C labeling glutamine glutamate increased enhancement TT. glutamate-to-glutamine ratio significantly lower TT. Immunoblots detected decrease hypothyroid hearts muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I) marked increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-2 changes liver CPT I, PDK-4, hexokinase 2. TT, T, displayed elevated glutamine synthetase (GS) expression. studies showed T3 regulates cardiac metabolism integration several mechanisms, including changes oxidative enzyme content rapid modulation individual substrates fluxes. T3 also moderates forward glutamine flux, possibly increasing overall activity GS.
