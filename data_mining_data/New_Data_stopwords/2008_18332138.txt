 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway emerged major regulator cellular functions implicated several pathologies involving remodeling extracellular matrix (ECM). end stage inflammatory joint diseases characterized excessive ECM catabolism, study assess role PI3K signaling induction collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) human chondrocytes. used potent cytokine stimulus reported promote cartilage ECM catabolism, namely interleukin-1 (IL-1) combination oncostatin (OSM). OSM IL-6 (in presence soluble receptor), IL-1 leukemia inhibitory factor, induced Akt phosphorylation human chondrocytes. Inhibition PI3K signaling using LY294002 blocked IL-1+OSM-mediated Akt phosphorylation, induction MMP-1 MMP-13, cartilage collagenolysis. explore role downstream substrates within PI3K pathway, complementary use small molecule inhibitors specific small interfering RNAs demonstrated PI3K subunit p110alpha Akt1 required MMP-1 mRNA induction. MMP-13 induction also reduced loss function molecules lack p110delta, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 Akt3. therefore propose activities specific elements PI3K signaling pathway, including Akt, necessary synergistic induction MMP-1 MMP-13 cartilage breakdown stimulated IL-1+OSM. data provide new insight mechanism synergy IL-1 OSM highlight new therapeutic targets inflammatory joint diseases aim repress expression collagenases.
