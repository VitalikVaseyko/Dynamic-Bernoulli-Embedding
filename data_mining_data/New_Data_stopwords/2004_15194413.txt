 Assessment islet viability transplantation mandatory successful clinical transplantation. ATP content energy charge (EC) islets may represent good parameter assess viability. introduced novel bioluminescent enzymatic cycling assay using synthetic firefly luciferase, pyruvate kinase) (PK), pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) determine adenine nucleotides (AN) isolated islets. complete assay requires several minutes. ATP contents 1, 3, 10, 30 100 islets diameter 150 microm 9.95 +/- 0.03, 28.3 +/- 1.18, 89.5 +/- 1.48, 282 +/- 10.2, 673 +/- 27.1 pmol, respectively, showing relatively constant ATP content per 30 islets (9.95, 9.42, 8.95, 9.41 pmol/IEQ). ECs group 0.74 +/- 0.02, 0.74 +/- 0.02, 0.75 +/- 0.02, 0.74 +/- 0.02, 0.65 +/- 0.01, respectively, value quite constant 30 islets. quantity ATP EC single islet measured quickly reproducibly, offering new method determine viability isolated islets prior transplantation.
