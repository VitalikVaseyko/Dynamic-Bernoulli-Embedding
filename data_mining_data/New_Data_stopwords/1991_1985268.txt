 Human X-linked Duchenne Becker muscular dystrophies due defects dystrophin, product exceptionally large gene. Although dystrophin characterized spectrin-like submembranous cytoskeletal protein, experimental evidence function structural maintenance muscle. Current hypotheses attribute necrosis dystrophin-less fibres situ mechanical weakening outer membrane, excessive influx Ca2+ ions, combination two mechanism, possibly mediated stretch-sensitive ion channels. Using hypo-osmotic shock determine stress resistance mouse model (mdx) human disease, show functional dystrophin contributes stability cultured myotubes isolated mature muscle fibres.
