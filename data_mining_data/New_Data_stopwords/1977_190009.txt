 1. Intact pure parenchymal non-parenchymal cells isolated rat liver. specific activities several mitochondrial enzymes determined parenchymal non-parenchymal cell homogenates characterize mitochondria liver cell types. 2. general activities mitochondrial enzymes lower non-parenchymal liver cells parenchymal cells. specific activity pyruvate carboxylase non-parenchymal cells expressed percentage parenchymal cells onlu 2% glutamate dehydrogenase 4.3% cytochrome c oxidase 79.4%. Monoamine oxidase, exception, equal specific activity cell types. 3. activity ratio pyruvate carboxylase 10 mM pyruvate 0.1 mM pyruvate 3.35 parenchymal cells 1.50 non-parenchymal cells. indicates non-parenchymal liver cells contain high affinity form pyruvate carboxylase contrast parenchymal cells. 4. ratio glycerol-3-phosphate cytochrome c reductase succinate cytochrome c reductase activity differs parenchymal (0.01) non-parenchymal cells (0.10). might indicate glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, important transport reduction equivalents cytosol mitochondria relatively active non-parenchymal cells parenchymal cells. 5. activity pattern mitochondrial enzymes parenchymal non-parenchymal cell homogenates indicates cell types contain different types mitochondria. presence different cell types liver therefore contribute heterogeneity isolated rat liver mitochondria mitochondria non-parenchymal cells might considered "non-gluconeogenic".
