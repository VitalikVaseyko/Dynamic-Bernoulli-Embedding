 AcB55, AcB61 CBA/N-Pk(slc) mice carry loss function mutations erythrocyte specific pyruvate kinase gene (Pklr). AcB55 AcB61 (Pklr(I90N)) PK deficiency protective blood-stage malaria. mechanistic basis protection malaria unknown studied two mutant alleles vivo. Pklr(G338D) mutation CBA/N-Pk(slc) mutant shown deleterious Pklr(I90N) allele respect enzymatic activity severity hemolytic anemia, dramatic reduction half-life erythrocytes (increased turnover) CBA/N-Pk(slc) mice. CBA/N-Pk(slc) mice also shown highly resistant infection Plasmodium chabaudi compared CBA/J CBA/N controls. Resistance malaria, measured lower levels blood-stage replication P. chabaudi, rapid elimination infected erythrocytes increased survival infection, greater Pklr(G338D) mutant, CBA/N-Pk(slc), Pklr(I90N) mutant strains, AcB55/AcB61. results strongly suggest correlation severity PK-deficiency extent protection malaria. Additionally, protective effect independent genetic background Pklr mutations occurred.
