 AIM: Recent studies rodents humans indicated bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells able home liver damaged demonstrated plasticity becoming hepatocytes. However, question remains stem cells activated led liver signals initiating mechanisms activation differentiation stem cells originate. aim study investigate influence serum liver-damaged rats differentiation tendency bone marrow-derived stem cells. METHODS: Serum samples collected rats treated 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) /carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) program varying time points used stimulators cultured BM stem cells. Expression M(2)- L-type isozymes rat pyruvate kinase, albumin well integrin-beta1 examined reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) estimate differentiation state BM stem cells. RESULTS: Expression M(2)-type isozyme pyruvate kinase (M(2)-PK), marker immature hepatocytes, detected group stimulated experimental serum, controls including mature hepatocytes, BM stem cells without serum stimulation, BM stem cells stimulated normal control serum. marker expressed development liver, expression signal integrin-beta1 also detectable group stimulated experimental serum. However, expression L-type isozyme pyruvate kinase (L-PK) albumin, marker molecules mature hepatocytes, detected groups stimulated experimental serum. CONCLUSION: influence serum rats liver failure, BM stem cells begin differentiate along direction hepatocyte lineage possess features immature hepatocytes.
