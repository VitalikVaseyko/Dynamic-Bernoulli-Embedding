 Defects energy metabolism potential pathogenic mechanisms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), rapidly fatal disease cure. mechanisms occurs remain elusive understanding may prove therapeutically useful. used metabolomics stable isotope tracers examine metabolic changes well-characterized cell model familial ALS, motor neuronal NSC-34 line stably expressing human wild-type Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (wtSOD1) mutant G93A (G93ASOD1). findings indicate wt G93ASOD1 expression enhanced glucose metabolism serum deprivation. However, wtSOD1 cells, phenotype increased supply amino acids protein glutathione synthesis, G93ASOD1 cells associated death, aerobic glycolysis, broad dysregulation amino acid homeostasis. Aerobic glycolysis mainly due induction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. study thus provides novel insight role deranged energy metabolism cause poor adaptation stress promoter neural cell damage presence mutant SOD1. Furthermore, metabolic alterations report may help explain mitochondrial dysfunction impairment endoplasmic reticulum stress response frequently seen ALS.
