 eukaryotes, different isoenzymes pyruvate kinase characterized. M2-type Pk cDNA mouse fetal ovary library isolated differential expression M1 M2-types testis development observed. presence M2 mRNAs decreases throughout development spermatogenesis, deduced M1 type expression increases adult testis coinciding presence elongating spermatids seminiferous epithelium. Polyadenylation tests showed concurrent increase length polyadenylation tail transcribed M1-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs prepuberal adult seminiferous tubules. similar relationship poly[A] tail extension differential increase gene expression detected M1-type mRNA adult brain muscle. Length poly[A] tail M2-type transcripts shown decrease development mouse testis. results suggest changes length poly[A] tail transcripts associated differential expression regulated isoenzymes testicular development.
