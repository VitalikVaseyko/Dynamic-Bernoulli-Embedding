 Dysregulated metabolism rarefaction capillary network play critical role pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) etiology. associated decrease perfusion lungs, skeletal muscles, right ventricle (RV). Previous studies suggested endothelin-1 (ET-1) modulates metabolism angiogenesis. hypothesized dual ETA/ETB receptors blockade improves PAH improving cell metabolism promoting angiogenesis. Five weeks disease induction, Sugen/hypoxic rats presented severe PAH pulmonary artery (PA) remodeling, RV hypertrophy capillary rarefaction lungs, RV, skeletal muscles (microCT angiogram, lectin perfusion, CD31 staining). Two-week treatment dual ETA/ETB receptors antagonist macitentan (30 mg/kg/d) significantly improved pulmonary hemodynamics, PA vascular remodeling, RV function hypertrophy compared vehicle-treated animals (all P = 0.05). Moreover, macitentan markedly increased lung, RV quadriceps perfusion, microvascular density (all P = 0.05). vitro, effects associated increases oxidative phosphorylation (oxPhox) markedly reduced cell proliferation PAH-PA smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) treated macitentan without affecting apoptosis. macitentan affect oxPhox, proliferation, apoptosis PAH-PA endothelial cells (PAECs), significantly improved angiogenic capacity (tube formation assay). Exposure control PASMC PAEC ET-1 fully mimicked PAH cells phenotype, thus confirming ET-1 implicated metabolism angiogenesis abnormalities PAH. Dual ETA/ETB receptor blockade improved metabolic changes involved PAH-PASMCs' proliferation angiogenic capacity PAH-PAEC leading increased capillary density lungs, RV, skeletal muscles.
