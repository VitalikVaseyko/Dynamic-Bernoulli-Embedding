 Studies described demonstrate ability glucagon, epinephrine, dibutyryl-cAMP stimulate glycogenolysis impaired rat hepatocytes isolated animals starved 24 h refed sucrose-rich diet refed standard rat chow. impaired regulation glycogenolysis glucagon observed within 24 h refeeding persisted least 3 days. inability glucagon stimulate glycogen breakdown refed condition appeared due suppressed activation glycogen phosphorylase phosphorylase b kinase hormone. capacity glucagon regulate pyruvate kinase glycolysis altered refeeding, suggesting defect lies beyond interaction hormone receptor. Prolonged incubation hepatocytes refed rats accompanied depletion glycogen reserves accompanied restoration hormonal stimulation glycogenolysis. Addition glycogen cell-free extracts found inhibit phosphorylase b kinase phosphorylase. findings investigation consistent interpretation high levels glycogen present liver refeeding may lead diminished activity phosphorylase b kinase hormonal regulation.
