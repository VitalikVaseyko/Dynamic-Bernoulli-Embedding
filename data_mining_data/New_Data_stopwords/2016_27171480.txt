 Glioblastoma, common brain tumor, characterized high proliferation rate, invasion, angiogenesis, chemo- radio-resistance. One remarkable feature glioblastoma switch toward glycolytic energetic metabolism leads high glucose uptake consumption strong production lactate. Activation several oncogene pathways like Akt, c-myc, ras induces glycolysis angiogenesis acts assure glycolysis prosecution, tumor proliferation, resistance therapy. Therefore, high glycolytic flux depends overexpression glycolysis-related genes resulting overproduction pyruvate lactate. Metabolism glioblastoma thus represents key issue cancer research. Flavopiridol synthetic flavonoid inhibits wide range Cyclin-dependent kinase, demonstrate inactivate glycogen phosphorylase, decreasing glucose availability glycolysis. work study glucose metabolism upon flavopiridol treatment two different glioblastoma cell lines. results obtained point towards effect flavopiridol glycolytic cells, thus suggesting possible new use compound flavopiridol-derived formulations combination anti-proliferative agents glioblastoma patients.
