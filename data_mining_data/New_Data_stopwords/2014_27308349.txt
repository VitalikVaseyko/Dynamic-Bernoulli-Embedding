 Senescence defined stable cell growth arrest. Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) occurs normal primary human cells activation oncogene absence cooperating oncogenic stimuli. OIS therefore considered bona fide tumor suppression mechanism vivo. Indeed, overcoming OIS-associated stable cell growth arrest lead tumorigenesis. Although cells undergone OIS replicate DNA, remain metabolically active. number recent studies report significant changes cellular metabolism OIS, including alterations nucleotide, glucose, mitochondrial metabolism autophagy. alterations may necessary stable senescence-associated cell growth arrest, overcoming shifts metabolism may lead tumorigenesis. review highlights currently known alterations cellular metabolism OIS implication OIS-associated metabolic changes cellular transformation development cancer therapeutic strategies.
