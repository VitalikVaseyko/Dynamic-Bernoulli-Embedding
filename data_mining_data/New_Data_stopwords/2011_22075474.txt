 understand compromised survival embryos derived assisted reproductive techniques, transcriptome survey early embryonic development shown impact vitro culture environment gene expression bovine living species. However, differentially expressed genes translate developmentally compromised embryos unresolved. therefore aimed characterize transcriptomic markers expressed bovine blastocysts cultured conditions known impair embryo development. increasing glucose concentrations shown stressful early cleavage stages mammalian embryos decrease subsequent blastocyst survival, vitro-matured/fertilized bovine zygotes cultured control (0.2 mM) high-glucose (5 mM) conditions 8- 16-cell stage, transferred control media reached blastocyst stage. concentration 5 mM glucose chosen stress treatment significant effect blastocyst rate without treatment's lethal 10 mM. Microarray analysis revealed gene expression differences unrelated embryo sex hatching. Overrepresented processes among differentially expressed genes treated blastocysts extracellular matrix signalling, calcium signaling, energy metabolism. pathophysiological level, higher glucose treatment impacts pathways associated diabetes tumorigenesis genes controlling Warburg effect, i.e., emphasis use anaerobic glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation. results allowed us conclude disruption vitro preattachment development concomitant gene expression modifications involved metabolic control.
