 Carbohydrate metabolism development fruits tomato cultivar Micro-Tom studied. metabolism pericarp placental tissues found different. Starch degraded slowly placenta comparison pericarp, whereas soluble sugars accumulated greater extent pericarp. activities glycolytic enzymes tended peak 40 days flowering. Two these, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase pyruvate kinase, showed dramatic increase activity peak, possibly indicating role up-regulating glycolysis generate increased ATP would used climacteric respiration. expression plastidial transporters studied. TPT Glu6P transporter expressed greatest green fruits, declining. expression triose-phosphate transporter greater glucose 6-phosphate transporter. ATP/ADP transporter expressed low level throughout fruit development.
