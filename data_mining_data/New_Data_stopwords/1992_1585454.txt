 Transgenic animals provide comprehensive model investigating genes encoding inducible enzymes involved metabolism, since molecular mechanisms regulating gene transcription studied whole animal. Studies promoters genes encoding two key enzymes gluconeogenic glycolytic pathways--phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase described examples approach. Work phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter using transgenic mice particularly informative: cis-acting elements involved hormonal regulation, tissue specificity developmental inhibition gene expression identified function vivo examined.
