 protein phosphatase dephosphorylates pyruvate kinase (PK) vitro purified characterized foot muscle anoxia tolerant gastropod mollusc Busycon canaliculatum. Purification involved three steps: negative chromatography Blue Dextran CM Sephadex, affinity chromatography DEAE Sephadex gel exclusion chromatography Sephacryl S-400. Pyruvate kinase phosphatase (PK-Pase) activity monitored following changes PK I50 values L-alanine previously linked changes degree PK phosphorylation. purified PK-Pase gave single band SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis molecular weight 41 +/- 1 kdaltons. Isoelectric focusing analysis showed PK-Pase isoelectric point 4.2 +/- 0.1. Kinetic analysis showed enzyme Type 2C protein phosphatase pH optimum 6.5. Maximal activity required presence magnesium ions (KM = 7.9 +/- 0.6 microM) although high concentrations Mg2+ inhibitory (I50 = 2.3 +/- 0.4 mM). protein phosphatase activity affected either spermine, cAMP, cGMP, potassium phosphate, tartrate, NaF, HgCl2, citrate concentrations CaCl2 less 10 mM. enzyme could also use ATP, ADP, GTP substrates.
