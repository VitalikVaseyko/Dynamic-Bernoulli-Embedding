 pyruvate kinase (PK) activity mouse liver increases injection endotoxin. decreases animals given cortisone alone remains essentially unchanged given cortisone endotoxin time. CCl(4) causes increase liver PK activity, neither endotoxin changes activity muscle PK. Addition octonoate liver homogenates inhibits activity liver PK. results suggest rapid depletion liver glycogen administration endotoxin CCl(4) may related increased PK activity. Induction tolerance prevent increase liver PK activity challenged animals.
