 present study aims clarify protective effect supplementation antioxidants, idebenone (200 mg/kg, ip), melatonin (10 mg/kg, ip) arginine (200 mg/kg, ip) combination, liver function (T. protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase), energetic parameters (adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate, inorganic phosphate, total adenylate, adenylate energy charge potential phosphate). effect glycolytic glycogenolytic enzymes (glucose, glycogen, glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase hypoxia) also studied. drugs administered 24 1 h prior sodium nitrite intoxication. biochemical parameters estimated 1 h sodium nitrite injection. Injection sodium nitrite (75 mg/kg, sc) produced significant disturbance biochemical parameters liver function, energetic parameters glycolytic glycogenolytic enzymes. Hepatic damage confirmed histopathological examination liver compared controls. marked changes hepatic cells induced sodium nitrite completely abolished pretreatment drug combination, suggesting potential protection sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia. could concluded combination idebenone melatonin idebenone arginine provides potential protection sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia improving biochemical parameters preserving liver histology.
