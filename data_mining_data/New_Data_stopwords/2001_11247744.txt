 Newly hatched precocial chicks arctic shorebirds able walk regulate body temperatures limited extent. Yet, must also grow rapidly achieve independence end short arctic growing season. rapid growth rate may conflict development mature function, allometric scaling thermal relationships, trade-off might resolved differently large small species. assessed growth (mass) functional maturity (catabolic enzyme activity) leg pectoral muscles chicks aged 1-16 adults two scolopacid shorebirds, smaller dunlin (Calidris alpina: neonate mass 8 g, adult mass 50 g) larger whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus; neonate mass 34 g, adult mass 380 g). Enzyme activity indicates maximum catabolic capacity, one aspect development functional maturity muscle. growth rate-maturity hypothesis predicts development catabolic capacity delayed faster-growing muscle masses. Leg muscles species larger proportion adult size hatching grew faster pectoral muscles. Pectoral muscles grew rapidly dunlin whimbrel, whereas leg muscles grew rapidly whimbrel. species leg pectoral muscles, enzyme activities generally increased age, suggesting increasing functional maturity. Levels citrate synthase activity similar reported species, l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase (PK) activities comparatively high. Catabolic capacities leg muscles initially high compared pectoral muscles, exception glycolytic (PK) capacities, subsequently increased modestly even decreased chicks grew. earlier functional maturity rapidly growing leg muscles, well generally higher functional maturity muscles rapidly growing dunlin chicks, contradicts growth rate-maturity function trade-off suggests birds considerable latitude modify relationship. Whimbrel chicks, apparently, rely allometric scaling power requirements locomotion thermal inertia larger mass reduce demands muscles, whereas dunlin chicks require muscles higher metabolic capacity earlier age. Thus, larger smaller species may adopt different strategies growth tissue maturation.
