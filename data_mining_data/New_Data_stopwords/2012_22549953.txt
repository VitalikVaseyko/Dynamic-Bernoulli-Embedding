 Metabolism generates oxygen radicals, contribute oncogenic mutations. Activated oncogenes loss tumor suppressors turn alter metabolism induce aerobic glycolysis. Aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect links high rate glucose fermentation cancer. Together glutamine, glucose via glycolysis provides carbon skeletons, NADPH, ATP build new cancer cells, persist hypoxia turn rewires metabolic pathways cell growth survival. Excessive caloric intake associated increased risk cancers, caloric restriction protective, perhaps clearance mitochondria mitophagy, thereby reducing oxidative stress. Hence, links metabolism cancer multifaceted, spanning low incidence cancer large mammals low specific metabolic rates altered cancer cell metabolism resulting mutated enzymes cancer genes.
