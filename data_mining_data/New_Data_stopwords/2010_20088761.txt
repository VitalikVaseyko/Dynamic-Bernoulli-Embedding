 many different species, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) constitutes major checkpoint anaerobic glycolysis, catalyzing reduction pyruvate lactate. enzyme recently received great deal attention since may constitute valid therapeutic target diseases different malaria cancer. fact, isoform expressed Plasmodium falciparum (pfLDH) key enzyme energy generation malarial parasites. species mostly depend anaerobic glycolysis energy production, since lack citric acid cycle ATP formation. Therefore, inhibitors pfLDH would potentially cause mortality P. falciparum and, purpose, several small organic molecules recently designed developed aim blocking new potential antimalarial chemotherapeutic target. Moreover, invasive tumour phenotypes show metabolic switch (Warburg effect) oxidative phosphorylation increased anaerobic glycolysis, promoting upregulation human isoform-5 lactate dehydrogenase (hLDH-5 LDH-A), normally present muscles liver. Hence, inhibition hLDH-5 may constitute efficient way interfere tumour growth invasiveness. review provides overview LDH inhibitors developed now, analysis possible isoform-selectivity, therapeutic potentials.
