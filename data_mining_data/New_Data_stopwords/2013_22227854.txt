 present study explored association Pyruvate Kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1) Adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) cervical carcinoma. case-control method designed collected 95 cervical biopsy samples, divided 30 controls 60 cases. Cases subdivided mild cervical carcinoma (MCC-25), intermediate cervical carcinoma (ICC-20), severe cervical carcinoma (SCC-20) method cervical pathology. expression PKM2, PFK-1, ANT1 examined methods immunohistochemistry western blotting (WB). results showed positive proportions PKM2 PFK-1 case group higher control, increased positive proportions PKM2 PFK-1 also revealed order Control, MCC, ICC, SCC (P<0.05). Further, results WB confirmed enhanced expressions PKM2 PFK-1 case group increasing trend PKM2 PFK-1 expressions Control, MCC, ICC, SCC groups. addition, WB result ANT1 showed lower level expression SCC group, positive proportion ANT1 significant cases group control. conclusion, PKM2 PFK-1 genes associated closely cervical carcinoma. enhanced expressions PKM2 PFK-1 indicate one developing signal cervical carcinoma.
