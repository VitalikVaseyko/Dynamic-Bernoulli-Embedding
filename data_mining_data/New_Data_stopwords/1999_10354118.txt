 Using direct sequencing analysed pyruvate kinase (PK) LR gene patient severe haemolytic anaemia due PK deficiency. novel promoter mutation -249delA relative translation initiation site common 1529A mutation exon 11 gene could identified. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis combined restriction digestion revealed -249delA mutation leads reduction amount mRNA produced allele 6% normal. assume mutations would account PK deficiency compound heterozygous patient.
