 concerted, allosteric model developed, equations derived quantitative interpretation kinetic equilibrium binding data rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase pH 7.5 23 degrees C. simplest model seems likely rationalize experimental data involves two conformational states. model, two simplifying assumptions made. First, affinities pyruvate kinase substrate inhibitor assumed depend upon conformational state tetrameric enzyme. Second, rate product formation also assumed depend upon enzyme conformation. types experimental data analyzed simultaneously estimate parameters best predict total body experimental results. fitted parameters indicate intrinsic allosteric equilibrium favors active (R) state 11 1. substrate phosphoenolpyruvate binds preferentially, factor 10, R state, whereas inhibitor Phe 23 times higher affinity inactive (T) state. cases tested, calculated values good agreement experimental data.
