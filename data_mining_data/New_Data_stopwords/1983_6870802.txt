 1. following measured pieces perirenal adipose tissue obtained foetal lambs 120 days gestation within 3 days term, 9-month-old sheep: rates synthesis glucose fatty acids, acylglycerol glycerol, pyruvate lactate; rate glucose oxidation CO2 proportions contributed pentose phosphate cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase tricarboxylic acid cycle; activities hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase. 2. total rate glucose utilization lower pieces adipose tissue near-term lambs 120-day foetal lambs pattern glucose metabolism differed, with, example, much smaller proportion glucose carbon used fatty acid synthesis, whereas greater proportion glucose oxidation occurred via tricarboxylic acid cycle near-term lambs. general, differences glucose metabolism associated differences activities various enzymes listed above. 3. rates glucose utilization per fat-cell 120-day foetal lambs 9-month-old sheep similar but, again, proportions metabolized various products differed. particular, smaller proportion glucose oxidized via pentose phosphate cycle greater proportion oxidized via pyruvate dehydrogenase tricarboxylic acid cycle adipose tissue foetal lambs. differences matched lower activity glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase higher pyruvate dehydrogenase activity fat-cells foetal lambs.
