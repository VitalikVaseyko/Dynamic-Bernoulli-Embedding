 Adult rat hepatocytes kept primary culture 48 h different hormonal conditions induce enzyme pattern respect carbohydrate metabolism approximated periportal perivenous hepatocytes vivo. 1. Glucagon-treated cells compared control cells possessed lower activity glucokinase, 4.5-fold higher activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase unchanged levels glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphofructokinase, fructose-bisphosphatase pyruvate kinase; resembled first approximation periportal cell type called simplicity 'periportal'. Inversely, insulin-treated cells compared control cells contained 2.2-fold higher activity glucokinase, slightly decreased activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, increased activities phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase unaltered levels glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-bisphosphatase; resembled perivenous cells called simply 'perivenous'. Gluconeogenesis glycolysis studied various substrate hormone concentrations. 2. Physiological concentrations glucose (5 mM) lactate (2 mM) gave 80% saturation gluconeogenesis lactate less 15% saturation glycolysis simultaneous 40% inhibition glycolytic rate lactate. 3. Comparison two cell types showed identical assay conditions (5 mM glucose, 2 mM lactate, 0.5 nM insulin, 0.1 muM dexamethasone) gluconeogenesis 1.5-fold faster 'periportal' cells glycolysis 2.4-fold faster 'perivenous' cells. 4. Metabolic rates short-term hormonal control. Insulin increased glycolysis three fold cell types half-maximal effect 0.4 nM, influence gluconeogenic rate. Glucagon inhibited glycolysis 70% half-maximal effect 0.1 nM. Gluconeogenesis stimulated glucagon (half-maximal dose: 0.5 nM) 1.8-fold 'periportal' cells containing high phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, 'perivenous' cells low level enzyme. 5. comparison two cell types showed maximally stimulating hormone concentrations gluconeogenesis threefold faster 'periportal' cells glycolysis eightfold faster 'perivenous' cells. results support view periportal perivenous hepatocytes vivo catalyse gluconeogenesis glycolysis inverse rates.
