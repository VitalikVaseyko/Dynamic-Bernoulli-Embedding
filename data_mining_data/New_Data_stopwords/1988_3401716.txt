 influence prolactin (Prl) bromocriptine specific activities neural glial cellular enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum pons-medulla studied. Prl bromocriptine stimulated activity hexokinase (HK) neural well glial cells. Prl increased activity phosphofructokinase (PFK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-3-PDH) pyruvate kinase (PK) neural cells, decreased glial cells. hand, bromocriptine elevated activity enzymes neural cells without effect glial cells. activities neural cellular glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGDH) inhibited Prl, whereas bromocriptine increased same. activities enzymes glial cells enhanced Prl bromocriptine. Thus, present study suggests Prl differential effect activities enzymes involved Embden-Meyerhoff pathway (EMP) hexosemonophosphate shunt (HMP) neural glial cells immature male bonnet monkeys.
