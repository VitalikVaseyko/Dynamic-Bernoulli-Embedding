 Daily rhythms regulated master clock-system suprachiasmatic nucleus peripheral clock-system organ. norepinephrine one timekeepers myocardial circadian clock influences cardiac metabolism, speculated beta-blocker may affect circadian clock metabolism heart tissue. study, thirty mg/kg/day propranolol (a lipophilic beta-blocker) atenolol (a hydrophilic beta-blocker) given orally Wistar rats 4 weeks. mRNA expressions Bmal1 E4BP4 heart tissue suppressed beta-blockers. However, mRNA expressions clock genes suprachiasmatic nucleus unchanged. Myocardial mRNA expressions lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 also suppressed beta-blockers. addition, ATP content heart tissue significantly elevated beta-blockers throughout 24 hours. effects propranolol atenolol differ significantly. study showed first time beta-blocker affects myocardial clock gene expression. Propranolol atenolol increased ATP content heart tissue throughout 24 hours. influences beta-blockers may negligible SCN, may independent lipid solubility heart tissue. well known drugs exert protective effect myocardial ischemia, may mediated increase preservation myocardial ATP.
