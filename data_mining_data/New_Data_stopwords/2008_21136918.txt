 Development ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) imposes significant financial burden health care system, yet therapeutic decisions rely conventional, less sensitive microbiological examination. Characterization proteins secreted bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) provides opportunity discovery diagnostic marker candidates accurate therapeutic decision-making. report first global description BALF proteome patients VAP. approach combining gel-assisted digestion followed SCX fractionation nano-LC-MS/MS effectively overcame interference high salt concentrations BALF. Semi-quantitative analysis simple, label-free approach based chromatographic peak area intensity revealed protein constituents dramatically different non-VAP controls VAP group. knowledge, 206 identified proteins present comprehensive global proteome map BALF. expression four selected proteins unique roles, including gelsolin, serum amyloid P-component, vitamin D-binding protein pyruvate kinase, significantly higher BALF patients VAP (p <0.05). demonstrate proteomic approach provides in-depth profiling BALF proteome, comprises proteins functionally associated pathogenesis VAP, including expressed due stress-induced injury host immune response local inflammation.
