 Insulin resistance induced vivo intravenous infusion glucosamine cells incubation glucosamine. However, publication (Hresko, R. C., et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 20658-20668) suggests trivial explanation glucosamine-induced insulin resistance whereby intracellular ATP pools depleted presumably due phosphorylation glucosamine glucosamine 6-phosphate, hexosamine pathway intermediate. reduced ATP level impaired insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation tyrosine kinase activity toward substrates. present work describes development comparison two methods inducing insulin resistance, treating 3T3-L1 adipocytes overnight using either 25 mM glucose/5 nM insulin 2 mM glucosamine. conditions basal glucose transport rates comparable controls. Insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake, however, reduced approximately 45% response high glucose/insulin glucosamine treatment, relative control cells. total relative amounts insulin-responsive glucose transporter, Glut4, remained constant treatment conditions. relative phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) contents insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) assessed whole cell homogenates. methods induce insulin resistance, IR/IRS-1 Tyr(P) levels virtually indistinguishable control cells. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation Akt Ser(473) impaired insulin-resistant cells. Furthermore, relative Tyr(P) content PDGF receptor comparable high glucose/insulin- glucosamine-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes upon subsequent challenge PDGF. Finally, relative amounts glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, two important hexosamine pathway enzymes, similar treatments compared controls. Thus, 3T3-L1 adipocytes used model system studying insulin resistance induced increased influx glucose. appropriate experimental conditions, glucosamine treatment mimic effects increased glucose flux without impairment tyrosine phosphorylation-based signaling.
