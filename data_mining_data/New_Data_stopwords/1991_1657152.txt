 reported yeast 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC 2.7.1.105) ca. 96-kDa subunit size, well isolation structural gene, PFK26. Sequencing shows open reading frame 827 amino acids 93.5 kDa. deduced amino acid sequence 42% identity 55-kDa subunit bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase rat liver extra material ends. Although yeast sequence especially similar liver one bisphosphatase domain, essential His-258 liver enzyme is, yeast, serine, may explain apparent lack bisphosphatase activity. Also, yeast enzyme known activated via protein kinase A, putative phosphorylation site near C-terminus lacks N-terminal phosphorylation sequence involved inhibition liver enzyme. chromosomal null mutant strain, pfk26::LEU2, activity marginal protein detectable antigen. mutant strain grew well glucose contained near-normal level fructose 2,6-P2. growth pyruvate, contrast wild-type strain, fructose 2,6-P2 detectable, form glucose addition presence cycloheximide either. resting cells, however, metabolized glucose normal high rate. Glucose addition pfk26 mutant strain absence cycloheximide, hand, caused ca. 10% normal rate fructose 2,6-P2 accumulation, presumably employing glucose-inducible second enzyme. Using strains also lacking 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, affinity chromatography revealed second enzyme minor peak amounting 6% 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity PFK26 strain sole peak, similar amount, pfk26 mutant strain.
