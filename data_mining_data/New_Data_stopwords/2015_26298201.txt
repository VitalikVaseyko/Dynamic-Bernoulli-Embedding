 ATP essential cellular function usually produced oxidative phosphorylation. However, mitochondrial dysfunction recognized important contributing factor development cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH metabolic change oxidative phosphorylation mainly glycolysis energy production. However, mechanisms underlying glycolytic switch poorly understood. particular role respiratory Complexes mitochondrial dysfunction associated PH unresolved focus investigations. report smooth muscle cells isolated pulmonary vessels rats PH (PH-PASMC), induced single injection monocrotaline, attenuated mitochondrial function enhanced glycolysis. Further, utilizing novel live cell assay, able demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction PH-PASMC correlates deficiencies activities Complexes I-III. Further, observed increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation mitochondrial membrane potential PASMC isolated rats PH. found defect Complex activity due loss Complex assembly, although assembly Complexes II III maintained. Thus, conclude loss Complex assembly may involved switch energy metabolism smooth muscle cells glycolysis maintaining Complex activity may potential therapeutic target treatment PH.
