 BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinomas subclassified clear cell carcinomas, chromophobe cell carcinomas, chromophilic cell carcinomas, oncocytomas. Previous studies, distinction among different types renal cell tumors grades malignancy performed, showed tumors high glycolytic rates. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: carbohydrate metabolism control human kidney samples renal clear cell carcinomas different degrees cytologic malignancy (G I, G II, G III) studied determining glycogen glucose-6-phosphate levels activities key enzymes involved glycolysis (hexokinase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase), gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase), pentose phosphate pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) tissues compared limited number chromophilic cell carcinomas, chromophobe cell carcinomas, oncocytomas. RESULTS: glycogen glucose-6-phosphate levels significantly higher G I, G II, G III clear cut carcinomas control kidneys; glucokinase, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities remained unchanged, pyruvate kinase activity enhanced, glucose-6-phosphatase well fructose-1,6-diphosphatase activities strongly reduced compared control kidney values. chromophilic cell carcinomas glycogen content, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase activities elevated, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase activity reduced. chromophobe cell carcinomas glycogen content elevated gluconeogenesis reduced, whereas glycolysis activated. oncocytomas glycogen detected glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase activities remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: demonstrated series characteristic changes occur carbohydrate metabolism renal clear cell carcinomas: glycogen glucose-6-phosphate levels increase, glycolysis activated, gluconeogenesis reduced. Furthermore, alterations carbohydrate metabolism within clear cell carcinomas clearly distinct observed chromophilic cell carcinomas, chromophobe cell carcinomas, oncocytomas.
