 rapid fractionation method determination metabolite levels chloroplast extrachloroplast compartment Chlamydomonas reinhardtii developed. Protoplasts containing one large chloroplast fractionated passing multilayer gradient containing digitonin, polyacrylamide, mixture silicone oil bromodecane. Lysis plasma membrane separation chloroplasts extrachloroplast material achieved within less 5 s. chloroplast enriched fraction contaminated 3% fumarase (mitochondria) 13% phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase (cytosol). Metabolites upper glycolytic chain detected mainly chloroplasts, whereas 2-phosphoglycerate found extrachloroplast compartment. Analysis changes metabolite concentrations transition anaerobic conditions dark pointed regulation carbohydrate catabolism chloroplast phosphofructokinase cytosolic pyruvatekinase.
