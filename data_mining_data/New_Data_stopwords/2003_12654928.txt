 Pyruvate kinases (PK, EC 2.7.1.40) three hyperthermophilic archaea (Archaeoglobus fulgidus strain 7324, Aeropyrum pernix, Pyrobaculum aerophilum) hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima compared respect thermophilic, kinetic, regulatory properties. PKs archaea 200-kDa homotetramers composed 50-kDa subunits. enzymes required divalent cations, Mg2+ Mn2+ effective, independent K+. Temperature optima activity 85 degrees C (A. fulgidus) 98 degrees C (A. pernix P. aerophilum). PKs highly thermostable 110 degrees C (A. pernix) showed melting temperatures thermal unfolding 93 degrees C (A. fulgidus) 98 degrees C (A. pernix P. aerophilum). archaeal PKs exhibited sigmoidal saturation kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP indicating positive homotropic cooperative response substrates. Classic heterotropic allosteric regulators PKs eukarya bacteria, e.g. fructose 1,6-bisphosphate AMP, affect PK activity hyperthermophilic archaea, suggesting absence heterotropic allosteric regulation. PK bacterium T. maritima also homotetramer 50-kDa subunits. enzyme independent K+ ions, temperature optimum 80 degrees C, highly thermostable 90 degrees C, melting temperature 98 degrees C. enzyme showed cooperative response PEP ADP. contrast archaeal counterparts, T. maritima enzyme exhibited classic allosteric response activator AMP inhibitor ATP. Sequences hyperthermophilic PKs showed significant similarity characterized PKs bacteria eukarya. Phylogenetic analysis PK sequences three domains indicates distinct archaeal cluster includes PK hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima.
