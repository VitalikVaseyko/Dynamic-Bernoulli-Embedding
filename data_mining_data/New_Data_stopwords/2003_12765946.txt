 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) inactivated many tissues starvation diabetes conserve three-carbon compounds gluconeogenesis. achieved increase extent PDC phosphorylation caused part increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity due increased PDK expression. study examined whether altered pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) expression also contributes changes phosphorylation state PDC starvation diabetes. two PDP isoforms expressed mammalian tissues, Ca(2+)-sensitive isoform (PDP1) highly expressed rat heart, brain, testis detectable less abundant rat muscle, lung, kidney, liver, spleen. Ca(2+)-insensitive isoform (PDP2) abundant rat kidney, liver, heart, brain detectable spleen lung. Starvation streptozotocin-induced diabetes cause decreases PDP2 mRNA abundance, PDP2 protein amount, PDP activity rat heart kidney. Refeeding insulin treatment effectively reversed effects starvation diabetes, respectively. findings indicate opposite changes expression specific PDK PDP isoenzymes contribute hyperphosphorylation therefore inactivation PDC heart kidney starvation diabetes.
