 growing incidence melanoma serious public health issue merits thorough understanding potential causative risk factors, includes exposure ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Though UVR classified complete carcinogen long recognized ability damage genomic DNA direct indirect means, precise mechanisms UVA UVB components UVR contribute pathogenesis melanoma clearly defined. review, therefore highlight recent studies addressed roles UVA radiation generation DNA damage modulating subsequent cellular responses DNA damage melanocytes, cell type gives rise melanoma. Recent research suggests UVA contributes direct formation DNA lesions also impairs removal UV photoproducts genomic DNA oxidation damage DNA repair proteins. Moreover, melanocyte microenvironment within epidermis skin also expected impact melanomagenesis, therefore discuss several paracrine signaling pathways shown impact DNA damage response UV-irradiated melanocytes. Lastly, examine alterations immune microenvironment UVA-associated DNA damage responses may contribute melanoma development. Thus, appear multiple avenues UVA may elevate risk melanoma. Protective strategies excess exposure UVA wavelengths light therefore potential decrease incidence melanoma. Environ. Mol. Mutagen, 2018. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
