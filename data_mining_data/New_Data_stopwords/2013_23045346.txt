 previously reported statin myopathy associated impaired carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation fast-twitch rodent skeletal muscle, hypothesised occurred result forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) mediated upregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) gene transcription. Upregulation FOXO gene targets known regulate proteasomal lysosomal muscle protein breakdown also evident. hypothesised increasing CHO oxidation vivo, using pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activator, dichloroacetate (DCA), would blunt activation FOXO gene targets reduce statin myopathy. Female Wistar Hanover rats dosed daily 12 days (oral gavage) either vehicle (control, 0.5% w/v hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose 0.1% w/v polysorbate-80; n = 9), 88 mg( )kg(-1) day(-1) simvastatin (n = 8), 88 mg( )kg(-1) day(-1) simvastatin + 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) DCA (n = 9) 88 mg kg(-1) day(-1) simvastatin + 40 mg kg(-1) day(-1) DCA (n = 9). Compared control, simvastatin reduced body mass gain food intake, increased muscle fibre necrosis, plasma creatine kinase levels, muscle PDK4, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) cathepsin-L mRNA expression, increased PDK4 protein expression, proteasome cathepsin-L activity, reduced muscle PDC activity. Simvastatin DCA maintained body mass gain food intake, abrogated myopathy, decreased muscle PDK4 mRNA protein, MAFbx cathepsin-L mRNA, increased activity PDC reduced proteasome activity compared simvastatin. PDC activation abolished statin myopathy rodent skeletal muscle, occurred least part via inhibition FOXO-mediated transcription genes regulating muscle CHO utilisation protein breakdown.
