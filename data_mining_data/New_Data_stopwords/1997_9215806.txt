 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), one major products lipid peroxidation, inactivated rate-limiting enzymes (from animal sources) glycolytic pathway pentose phosphate pathway incubated 37 degrees C 1 h absence glutathione (GSH). HNE concentration half-maximal inactivation 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3-10 microM; value pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinases II 0.15-0.6 mM. presence 5 mM GSH, however, PFK, irrespective source (muscle, liver, erythrocyte), inactivated 40-50% incubated 0.1 mM HNE 1 h. Even PFK inactivated presence GSH substrate, ATP (2 mM). Glycolysis human erythrocytes affected treatment cells 0.1 mM HNE 37 degrees C 30 min. results suggest HNE, concentrations observable physiological pathological conditions, hardly affects glycolysis cells.
