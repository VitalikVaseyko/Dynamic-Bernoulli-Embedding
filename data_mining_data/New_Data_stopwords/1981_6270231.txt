 Activities ten main metabolic pathway enzymes seven lysosomal enzymes determined specimens human normal palmar fascia Dupuytren's contracture. activities enzymes tested 2-3 times higher fresh specimens Dupuytren's contracture. differences activity distribution patterns specimens, absolute activities calculated relation glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. exception adenylate kinase pyruvate kinase, activities main metabolic pathway enzymes based DNA content showed significantly lower activities Dupuytren's contracture tissue palmar fascia. Lysosomal enzymes exhibit significant differences activity respective specimens. However, lysosomal enzyme activities cultured fibroblasts lower corresponding activities tissue specimens. enzyme activities per DNA content cultured fibroblasts 10-50 times higher tissue specimens. enzyme activities cultured fibroblasts decrease age density cells culture. increased metabolic activity diseased tissues Dupuytren's contracture due higher cell content afflicted portions tissue, individual enzymes show qualitative changes activity increases enzyme activity per cell (DNA).
