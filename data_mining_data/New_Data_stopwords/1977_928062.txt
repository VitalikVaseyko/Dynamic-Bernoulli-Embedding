 rapid, simple inexpensive procedure described preparation purine ribo-and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates specifically highly radiolabeled [32P]phosphate beta position. method involves two successive enzymatic reactions: conversion donor [gamma-32P]ATP presence excess acceptor 5'-mononucleotide 5'-diphosphates myokinase guanosine 5'-monophosphate kinase followed phosphorylation pyruvate kinase yield 5'-triphosphates.
