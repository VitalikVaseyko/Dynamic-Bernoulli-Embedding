 Two types pyruvate kinases found Fusarium oxysporum. One type (inducible) present mainly early stages growth glucose sucrose displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate adenosine diphosphate. major type (constitutive) present conditions growth displayed absence potassium ions, sigmoidal substrate saturation curve phosphoenolpyruvate used variable substrate. presence potassium ions saturation curve phosphoenolpyruvate exhibits plateau half-maximal velocity. effects various metabolites activity inducible constitutive kinases also studied. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate, cyclic AMP, acetyl CoA, tryptophan, phenylalanine effect activity enzymes. Citrate potent inhibitor constitutive pyruvate kinase activity increased sigmoidicity saturation curve phosphoenolpyruvic acid. presence K+, bimodal plot observed absence citrate gradually changed hyperbolic shape concentration citric acid increased. presence K+ ADP variable substrate citric acid converted hyperbolic plot sigmoidal one. Citrate effect inducible enzyme.
