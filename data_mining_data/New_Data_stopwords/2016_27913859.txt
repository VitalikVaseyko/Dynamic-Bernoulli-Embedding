 Human infection Salmonella global public health concern. low- middle-income countries, Salmonella infection major source disease terms mortality morbidity, high-income nations, pathogen ongoing threat food security. outcome infection Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) mouse models dependent upon coordinated complex immune response. panel recombinant congenic strains (RCS) derived reciprocal double backcross A/J C57BL/6J mice screened susceptibility Salmonella infection, RCS AcB60 identified resistant strain Salmonella infection, resistant parental strain A/J. mice known carry resistant alleles three well-defined Salmonella susceptibility loci, Slc11a1 (Ity) (solute carrier family 11 member 1; Immunity Typhimurium locus), Pklr (Ity4) (pyruvate kinase liver red blood cell; Ity4 locus), Ity5. current study, used interval mapping validate locus Chr 15, named Ity8, linked Salmonella resistance AcB60 mice. Global gene expression analysis infection identified AcB60-specific expression genes involved Ccr7 signaling, including downstream effector Mapk11 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 11), located within Ity8 interval, representing potential positional candidate gene. additional region Chr 18 C57BL/6J descent shown associated increase resistance AcB60. observations provide opportunity achieve new insight complex genetics resistance Salmonella infection context mouse models human infection Salmonella Typhimurium.
