 metabolic effects oxalate pyruvate kinase studied intact human red blood cells compared spontaneous modifications induced congenital pyruvate kinase deficiency. normal cells, oxalate (2-3 . 10(-4) M) produces large increase monophosphoglycerates, phosphoenolpyruvate pool decrease pyruvate concentrations result pyruvate kinase inhibition; significantly modify 2,3-diphosphoglycerate level, ATP formation overall glycolytic activity. effects oxalate due Mg2+ chelation. similar metabolite pattern observed vivo erythrocytes congenital pyruvate kinase deficiency, ATP concentration glycolytic activity described. cells sensitive oxalate normal ones. Results discussed reference rate-limiting character normal congenitally deficient pyruvate kinase.
