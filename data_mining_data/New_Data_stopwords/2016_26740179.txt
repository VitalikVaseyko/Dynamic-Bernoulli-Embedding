 Chronic inflammation augments deleterious effects several diseases, particularly diabetes, cancer, sepsis. also involved process metabolic shift glucose oxidation lactate production. Although several studies suggest change activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) major factor causing metabolic change, exact mechanism inflammatory state remains unclear. study, investigated effect lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), strongly associated inactivation PDC C2C12 myoblasts. C2C12 myoblasts, LPS exposure led increased PDK4 mRNA protein expression levels well lactate production culture medium. However, expression levels PDK isoenzymes (PDK1 - 3) remained unchanged. Additionally, observed LPS treatment induced phosphorylation Jun N-Terminal Kinases (JNK). confirm role JNK, inhibited JNK pathway observed PDK4 expression lactate production decreased, p38 ERK significantly changed. Taken together, results suggest LPS induces PDK4 expression alters glucose metabolism via JNK pathway.
