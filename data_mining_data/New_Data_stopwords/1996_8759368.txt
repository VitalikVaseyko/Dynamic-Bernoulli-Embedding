 effects acute bout prolonged exercise activities several hepatic lipogenic enzymes abundance fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA evaluated using food deprivation-refeeding protocol diets contained 50% energy either fructose cornstarch. Food withheld male rats 48 h refed 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 48 h. time point, half dietary group subjected single bout treadmill running exhaustion killed immediately. half group rested without food amount time killed. Exercise significantly decreased FAS activity 57, 46, 10, 26 70% 4, 8, 12, 24 48 h refeeding, respectively, fructose-fed rats; 70 63% 24 48 h refeeding, respectively, cornstarch-fed rats. Activities L-type pyruvate kinase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase significantly decreased exercise fructose-fed, cornstarch-fed rats. rested rats, FAS mRNA abundance increased approximately fourfold unfed levels 8 12 h refeeding. Exercise attenuated diet-induced increases FAS mRNA abundance. 8 h refeeding, cornstarch- fructose-fed exercised rats 71% (P < 0.05) FAS mRNA levels rested counterparts; 12 h, exercised rats showed 46 27% (P < 0.05) FAS mRNA levels compared rested rats fed diet. conclude dietary induction FAS activity mRNA abundance inhibited prolonged exercise, suggesting exercise may influence FAS transcription and/or mRNA stability.
