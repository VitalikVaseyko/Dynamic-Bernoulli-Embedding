 Electrophoretic variation ascribable three enzyme loci, coding pyruvate kinase (PK1), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1), observed three species fish genus Xiphophorus. Electrophoretic patterns F1 hybrid heterozygotes confirmed dimeric structures GPI IDH, indicated multimeric structure pyruvate kinase. Variant alleles three loci exhibited normal Mendelian segregation backcross hybrids. Linkage analyses indicate gene order estimated recombination PK1--10%--GPI1--41%--IDH1. significant interference sex- population-specific recombination difference detected. group (designated linkage group IV) shown assort independently nine loci comprising linkage groups I, II, III 23 informative markers, within limits data. conclusions respect homology linkage relationships could reached, due presence presumably duplicated loci fish coding isozymes whose homology enzymes vertebrate species yet unestablished.
