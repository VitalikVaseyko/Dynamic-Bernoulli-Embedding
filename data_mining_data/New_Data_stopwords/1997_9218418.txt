 Twenty-six different hepatoma cell lines established cancer-prone transgenic mice exhibited close correlation expression GLUT 2 glucose transporter activation L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene glucose, judged Northern blot analyses transient transfection assays. L-PK gene transfected L-PK construct silent GLUT 2(+) cells active GLUT 2(-) cells cultured glucose-free medium. Transfection GLUT 2(-) cells GLUT 2 expression vector restored inducibility L-PK promoter glucose, mainly suppressing glucose-independent activity promoter. Culture GLUT 2(-) cells, L-PK gene constitutively expressed, culture medium using fructose fuel selected GLUT 2(+) clones L-PK gene responded glucose. expression L-PK gene GLUT 2(-) cells cultured absence glucose correlated high intracellular glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) concentration similar culture conditions Glu-6-P concentration low GLUT 2(+) cells. Consequently, role GLUT 2 glucose responsiveness glucose-sensitive genes cultured hepatoma cells could allow Glu-6-P depletion gluconeogenic culture conditions. absence GLUT 2, glucose endogeneously produced might unable exported cells would phosphorylated Glu-6-P constitutively expressed hexokinase isoforms, continuously generating glycolytic intermediates active L-PK gene transcription.
