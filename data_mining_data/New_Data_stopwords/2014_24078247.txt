 application dipolar direct current (DDC) radio frequency-only ion guide (Q0) hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer collision-induced declustering large bio-ions described. broadband technique, ion trap DDC collisional activation (CA) employed decluster ions simultaneously relatively broad mass-to-charge (m/z) range. Declustering DDC CA yield significantly narrower peaks relative observed absence declustering methods, depending upon extent noncovalent adduction associated ions, also used conjunction methods, nozzle-skimmer CA. key experimental variables DDC experiment DDC voltage (VDDC), VRF , time VDDC applied. VDDC/VRF ratio key extent ion temperatures elevated also influences upper m/z limit ion storage. VDDC/VRF ratio affects ion temperatures upper m/z limit opposing directions. is, ratio increases, ion temperature also increases, whereas upper m/z storage limit decreases. However, given VDDC /VRF ratio, upper m/z storage limit increased increasing VRF, expense lower m/z limit ion storage. key value approach affords relatively precise degree control ion temperatures well time elevated higher temperature. utility method illustrated application ion trap DDC CA Q0 oligonucleotide, protein, multimeric protein complex analyte ions.
