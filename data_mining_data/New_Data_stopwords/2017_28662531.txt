 Background Team handball intense ball sport specific requirements technical skills, tactical understanding, physical performance. ability handball players develop explosive efforts (e. g. sprinting, jumping, changing direction) crucial success. Objective purpose pilot study examine effects in-season high-intensity strength training program physical performance elite handball players. Materials methods Twenty-two handball players (a single national-level Tunisian team) randomly assigned control group (CG; n = 10) training group (TG; n = 12). beginning pilot study, subjects performed battery motor tests: one repetition maximum (1-RM) half-squat test, repeated sprint test [6 x (2 x 15 m) shuttle sprints], squat jumps, counter movement jumps (CMJ), Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1. TG additionally performed maximal leg strength program twice week 10 weeks immediately engaging regular handball training. strength training session included half-squat exercises strengthen lower limbs (80 - 95 % 1-RM, 1 - 3 repetitions, 3 - 6 sets, 3 - 4 min rest sets). control group underwent additional strength training. motor test battery repeated end study interventions. Results TG, 3 parameters (maximal strength lower limb: eta(2) = 0.74; CMJ: eta(2) = 0.70, RSA best time: eta(2) = 0.25) showed significant improvements, large effect sizes (e. g. CMJ: = 3.77). reduction performance 3 parameters observed CG (d = -0.24). Conclusions results support hypothesis additional strength training twice week enhances maximal strength lower limbs jumping repeated sprinting performance. evidence shuttle sprints ahead regular training compromising players' speed endurance capacities.
