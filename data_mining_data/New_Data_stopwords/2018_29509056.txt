 mechanisms beyond Warburg effect proliferative mammalian cells, well similar Crabtree effect yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, still matter debate: cells shift energy-efficient respiration energy-inefficient fermentation high sugar concentration? review reports strong similarities phenomena cell types, discusses current ideas, provides novel interpretation common functional mechanism dynamic perspective. achieved analyzing another phenomenon, sugar-induced-cell-death (SICD) occurring yeast high sugar concentration, highlight link ATP depletion cell death. integration SICD dynamic functioning glycolytic process, suggests fitness advantage Crabtree/Warburg effect long term, consists maintenance cell energetic homeostasis, therefore strategic cell survival.
