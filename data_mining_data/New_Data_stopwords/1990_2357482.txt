 Pyruvate kinase studies granulocyte-macrophage lineage vitro differentiation performed using culture techniques GM-CFC cells study also done bone marrow cells. enzyme exhibits biphasic behaviour respect substrates cells derived vitro cultures 5 7 days incubation period. However bone marrow cells kinetics observed ADP. different kinetic behaviour pyruvate kinase toward Fru-1,6-P2, Ala, Phe ATP three cellular populations allows us conclude expression pyruvate kinase associated differentiation cells.
