 Photoautotrophic calli Nicotiana plumbaginifolia grown 3 weeks two CO(2) concentrations (500 20,000 microliters CO(2) per liter). Calli cultured high CO(2) exhibited two-fold higher rate growth. CO(2) test levels, calli characterized lower net photosynthetic capacity calli cultured low CO(2). diminution due CO(2) adaptation could ascribed 170% stimulation dark respiration, 40% decrease total ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activity, also feedback inhibition photosynthesis: high CO(2) grown calli contained 5.5-fold sucrose three-fold less orthophosphate (Pi) low CO(2) grown calli. Whether decrease Rubisco activity related accumulation sucrose Pi limitation discussed. calli exhibited Warburg-effect showing existence active photorespiration low CO(2). calli grown low CO(2) 5 millimolar aminoacetonitrile (AAN), inhibitor glycolate pathway, fresh weight decreased 25% chlorophyll content 40%, dark respiration increased 50% net CO(2) uptake decreased 60% 340 microliters CO(2) per liter 35% 10,000 microliters CO(2) per liter. calli, glutamine glutamate contents half control calli. contrast, AAN provoke noticeable effect calli grown high CO(2). photoautotrophic calli, inhibition glycolate pathway AAN results severe perturbations glutamate metabolism chlorophyll biosynthesis.
