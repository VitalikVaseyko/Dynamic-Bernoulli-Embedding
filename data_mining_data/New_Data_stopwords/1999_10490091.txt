 OBJECTIVE: define disease-causing mutation West Highland White Terriers (WHWT) erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (R-PK) deficiency design genetic test capable recognizing affected (homozygous) carrier (heterozygous) dogs. ANIMALS: 3 anemic WHWT littermates 1 unaffected littermate; 16 dogs kennel, including 4 unrelated, phenotypically normal dogs (control dogs), 12 PK activity known; 2 PK-deficient Basenjis; 2 PK-deficient Beagles; 4 unaffected English Springer Spaniels; 1 mixed-breed dog. PROCEDURES: cDNA cloned sequenced, cDNA sequences compared published sequence canine R-PK cDNA identify putative disease-causing mutation. Genomic DNA spanning affected region cloned sequenced verify mutation. Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction primers designed amplify section gene containing mutation DNA blood buccal swab samples. Gel electrophoresis allowed assignment genotypes basis allele separation. RESULTS: 4 single base polymorphisms attributable sequencing errors published sequence identified, along 6 base pair (bp) insertion exon 10 recognized putative disease-causing mutation. identical insertion found genomic DNA. Amplification genomic DNA yielded 117 bp product genotypically normal dogs 123 bp product WHWT homozygous PK deficiency. Carriers 1 copy allele variable heteroduplex structures. CONCLUSIONS CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 6 bp insertion C domain R-PK identified WHWT PK deficiency. Affected carrier dogs could distinguished genetic test.
