 Pyruvate kinase (PKLR) deficiency protects mice humans blood-stage malaria. Although mouse strain AcB62 carries malaria-protective PklrI90N genetic mutation, phenotypically susceptible blood stage malaria induced infection Plasmodium chabaudi AS, suggesting genetic modifier PklrI90N protective effect. Linkage analysis F2 cross AcB62 (PklrI90N) another PK deficient strain CBA/Pk (PklrG338D) maps modifier (designated Char10) chromosome 9 (LOD = 10.8, 95% Bayesian CI = 50.7-75Mb). study mechanistic basis Char10 effect, generated incipient congenic line (Char10C) harbors Char10 chromosome 9 segment AcB62 fixed genetic background CBA/Pk. Char10 effect shown highly penetrant Char10C line recapitulates AcB62 phenotype, displaying high parasitemia following P. chabaudi infection, compared CBA/Pk. Char10C mice also display reduction anemia phenotypes associated PklrG338D mutation including decreased splenomegaly, decreased circulating reticulocytes, increased density mature erythrocytes, increased hematocrit, well decreased iron overload kidney liver decreased serum iron. Erythroid lineage analyses indicate number total TER119+ cells well numbers different CD71+/CD44+ erythroblast sub-populations found lower Char10C spleen compared CBA/Pk. Char10C mice also displayed lower number CFU-E per spleen compared CBA/Pk. Taken together, results indicate Char10 locus modulates severity pyruvate kinase deficiency regulating erythroid responses presence PK-deficiency associated haemolytic anemia.
