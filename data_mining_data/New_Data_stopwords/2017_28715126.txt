 Changes allosteric regulation glycolytic enzymes linked metabolic reprogramming involved cancer. Remarkably, allosteric mechanisms control enzyme function significantly shorter time-scales compared long-term effects metabolic reprogramming cell proliferation. remains unclear speed reversibility afforded rapid allosteric control metabolic enzymes important cell proliferation. Tools allow specific, dynamic modulation enzymatic activities mammalian cells would help address question. Towards goal, used molecular dynamics simulations guide design mPKM2 internal light/oxygen/voltage-sensitive domain 2 (LOV2) fusion position D24 (PiL[D24]), engineered pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) variant harbours insertion light-sensing LOV2 domain Avena Sativa within region implicated allosteric regulation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). LOV2 photoreaction preserved PiL[D24] chimera causes secondary structure changes associated 30% decrease Km enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate resulting increased pyruvate kinase activity light exposure. Importantly, change activity reversible upon light withdrawal. Expression PiL[D24] cells leads light-induced increase labelling pyruvate glucose. PiL[D24] therefore could provide means modulate cellular glucose metabolism remote manner paves way studying importance rapid allosteric phenomena regulation metabolism enzyme control.
