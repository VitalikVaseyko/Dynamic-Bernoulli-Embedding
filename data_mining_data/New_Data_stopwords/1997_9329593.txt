 monoclonal antibody pyruvate kinase type tumor M2 (TUM2-PK) shown high binding capacity pancreatic cancer. present study TUM2-PK serum levels measured pancreatic cancer compared reference tumor markers CA19-9, CA50, CA72-4 CEA. Overall 100 patients included study, 64 patients histologically confirmed pancreatic carcinoma, 36 patients gastrointestinal cancer (stomach, colon), 666 healthy volunteers served controls. Measurements done enzymimmunoassay. healthy blood donors cut-off value 22.5 U/ml evaluated, corresponds 95% specificity. patients pancreatic cancer sensitivities TUM2-PK, CA19-9, CEA, CA72-4 CA50 71%; 68%, 37%, 49% 63.4% respectively. Linear regression analysis indicated positive correlation (r = 0.79). According results study TUM2-PK comparable sensitivity higher specificity reference tumor marker CA19-9.
