 completion human genome project construction single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps lead significant efforts find SNPs linked pathophysiology. silico models complete biochemical reaction networks relate cell's individual reactions function entire network. Sequence variations turn related kinetic properties individual enzymes, thus allowing silico model-driven assessment effects defined SNPs overall cellular functions. process applied defined SNPs two key enzymes human red blood cell metabolism: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. results demonstrate utility silico models providing insight differences red cell function patients chronic nonchronic anemia. silico models complex cellular processes thus likely aid defining understanding key SNPs human pathophysiology.
