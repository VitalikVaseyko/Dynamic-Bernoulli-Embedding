 Disuse osteoporosis, occurs commonly prolonged bed rest immobilization, becoming major problem modern societies; however, molecular mechanisms underlying unloading-driven bone loss fully elucidated. osteocyte network considered ideal mechanosensor mechanotransduction system. searched molecules responsible disuse osteoporosis using BCL2 transgenic mice, osteocyte network disrupted. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), upregulated femurs tibiae wild-type mice BCL2 transgenic mice tail suspension. Bone Pdk4(-/-) mice developed normally maintained. unloading, however, bone mass reduced due enhanced osteoclastogenesis Rankl expression wild-type mice Pdk4(-/-) mice. Osteoclast differentiation Pdk4(-/-) bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage lineage cells (BMMs) presence M-CSF RANKL suppressed, osteoclastogenesis impaired coculture wild-type BMMs Pdk4(-/-) osteoblasts, Rankl expression promoter activity reduced. Further, introduction Pdk4 Pdk4(-/-) BMMs osteoblasts enhanced osteoclastogenesis Rankl expression activated Rankl promoter. findings indicate Pdk4 plays important role bone loss unloading promoting osteoclastogenesis.
