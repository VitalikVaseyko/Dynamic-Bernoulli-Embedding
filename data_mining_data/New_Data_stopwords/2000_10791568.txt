 regulation pyruvate kinase activity noradrenaline investigated Rana balcanica red cells. Thirty minutes noradrenaline incubation induced significant increase Vo/Vmax ratio pyruvate kinase. S0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate enzyme significantly increased presence noradrenaline Km ADP decreased. response hormonal stimulation Na +/H+ exchange activated shown increase Na+ cyclic adenosine monophosphate 3rd min incubation. effects specific alpha1 beta antagonists. High concentrations fructose diphosphate significantly activated enzyme presence noradrenaline absence. Furthermore, presence noradrenaline partially released inhibition enzyme adenosine triphosphate, inorganic phosphate 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. results suggest noradrenaline stimulates glycolysis pyruvate kinase activation. mechanism stimulation may Na+/H+ exchange activation, cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activation.
