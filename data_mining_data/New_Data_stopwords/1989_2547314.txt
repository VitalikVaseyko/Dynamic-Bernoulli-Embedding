 P1,P5-di(adenosine 5')pentaphosphate (Ap5A) excellent inhibitor human hemolysate adenylate kinase concentrations near 2 microM above. ten times concentration hemolysate enzyme assays conditions described paper appears alter reaction data case hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglycerokinase. pyruvate kinase assay, modest reductions activity noted, kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), uridine diphosphate (UDP) unaltered.
