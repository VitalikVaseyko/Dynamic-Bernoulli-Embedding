 Malignant cells highly dependent aerobic glycolysis, differs significantly normal cells (the Warburg effect). Interference metabolic process considered innovative method developing selective cancer therapy. recent study demonstrated glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) potentiate PDT efficacy, whereas possible mechanisms carefully investigated. study firstly proved general potentiation PDT efficacy 2-DG 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, carefully elucidated underlying mechanism process. results showed 2-DG 3-BP could significantly promote PDT-induced cell cytotoxic effect compared either monotherapy. Synergistic potentiation mitochondria- caspase-dependent cell apoptosis observed, including mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) drop, Bax translocation, caspase-3 activation. Besides, ROS generation expression oxidative stress related proteins P38 MAPK phosphorylation JNK phosphorylation notably increased combined treatments. Moreover, pretreated ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC), ROS generation, MMP drop, cell apoptosis cytotoxicity differently inhibited, suggesting ROS vertical pro-apoptotic process induced 2-DG/3-BP combined PDT treatment. results indicate combination glycolytic antagonists PDT may promising therapeutic strategy effectively kill cancer cells.
