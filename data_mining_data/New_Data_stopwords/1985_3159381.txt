 Experimental hyperthyroidism induced rats daily injections 3,3',5,5'-tetraiode-L-thyroxine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) 14 days resulted significant increase heart weight heart weight/body weight ratio. Hemodynamic morphological studies performed one group. Thyroxine-treated rats showed characteristic cardiovascular hyperdynamic state, tachycardia augmented rate contraction, evidence heart failure elevated end-diastolic pressures. cardiac cells hyperthyroid rats significantly larger diameter mitochondria control rats. another group activities cardiac enzymes involved energy utilization liberation measured biochemically compared normal controls. Hyperthyroidism resulted increased specific activity cytochrome C oxidase actomyosin ATPase myocardium. specific activity long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, carnitine palmityl-transferase, carnitine acetyltransferase, malate dehydrogenase citrate synthase showed moderate marked increment, whereas specific activity lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase remained control values. results suggest hyperthyroid rat hearts functions energy liberation utilization systems enhanced meet added workload. Moreover, increased activity enzymes participating fatty acid metabolism suggest thyroxine-induced hypertrophic hyperdynamic rat hearts, fatty acids contribute energy supply carbohydrates.
