 activities zonal distribution key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism studied livers diabetic rats. 48 h alloxan treatment following alterations observed, intermediate values reached 24 h: Blood glucose, acetoacetate beta-hydroxybutyrate increased 500%; liver glycogen reduced 10%. Portal vein insulin reduced 10%, portal glucagon increased almost 200%. glucogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glucose-6-phosphatase enhanced 320% 150%, respectively. glycolytic enzymes glucokinase pyruvate kinase L (differentiated M2 isoenzyme specific anti-L-antibody) lowered 50% 75%, respectively. citrate cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase remained unchanged. normal periportal perivenous gradient phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 3:1, measured microdissected tissue samples, enhanced 4:1 activities elevated 230% 190%, respectively, two zones. normal periportal perivenous gradient pyruvate kinase L 1:1.7, determined microdissection technique, reduced 1:1.4 levels lowered 55% 45%, respectively, two zones. even zonal distribution pyruvate kinase M2 remained unaltered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
