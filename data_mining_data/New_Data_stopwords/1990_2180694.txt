 Immunological methods protein visualization afford high sensitivity, good specificity resolution. used indirect immunoassay peroxidase- 125I-labelled antibodies investigate microheterogeneity pyruvate kinase human red blood cells show enzyme pattern 10 single bands. Different methods tested applicability protein fixation subsequent immunological visualization polyacrylamide gels. Besides Western blot, immunofixation ethanolic fixation recommended fixation techniques, especially isoelectric focusing ultrathin gels.
