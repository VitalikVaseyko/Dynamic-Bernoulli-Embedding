 kinetics rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase studied assays pH 7.4, relationships initial velocities catalysed reaction concentrations substrates ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate Mg2+ non-hyperbolic. data used test applicability exponential model regulatory enzyme, extended describe behaviour three-substrate enzyme. appears data represented model result permit conclusion substrates influence one another's binding type charge interactions evident Michaelis-Menten kinetics enzyme observed pH 6.2. Evidence also presented indicating MgADP acts dead-end inhibitor enzyme pH 7.4.
