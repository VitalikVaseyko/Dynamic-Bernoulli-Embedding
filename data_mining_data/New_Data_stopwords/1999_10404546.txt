 effects ethanol extract root Plumbago zeylanica key enzymes glycolysis biochemical parameters studied rat. results show thigh muscle hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activities significantly reduced (p < 0.05) 12.07%, 51.02%, 24.32% 25.16% respectively rats treated ethanol extract Plumbago zeylanica compared controls. Serum pyruvate lactate significantly lowered experimental rats 23.64% 46.29%, respectively. difference supernatant protein means statistically different (p > 0.05) suggesting preservation protein synthesis muscle extract-treated rats. reduction activities key enzymes glycolysis end-products suggests reduction flux across glycolytic pathway extract-treated rats. may result impaired delivery to, utilization of, glucose peripheral tissue, thus substantiating reported hyperglycaemia extract-treated rats.
