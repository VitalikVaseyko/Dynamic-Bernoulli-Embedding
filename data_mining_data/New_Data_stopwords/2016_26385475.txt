 rational design allosteric kinase modulators challenging rewarding. protein kinase PDK1, lies center growth-factor signaling pathway, possesses allosteric regulatory site previously validated vitro cells. ANCHOR.QUERY software used discover potent allosteric PDK1 kinase modulator. Using recently published PDK1 compound template, several new scaffolds bind allosteric target site generated one example validated. inhibitor synthesized one step multicomponent reaction (MCR) chemistry using ANCHOR.QUERY approach. results significant outlined approach allows rapid efficient scaffold hopping known molecules new easily accessible biologically active ones. Based increasing interest allosteric-site drug discovery, foresee many potential applications approach.
