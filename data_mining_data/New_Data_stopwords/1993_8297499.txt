 Phenylarsine oxide (PAO), trivalent arsenical complexes vicinal dithiols, prevented action insulin primary cultured adult rat hepatocytes. Simultaneous short-term treatment 48-h old cells insulin 2 microM PAO resulted complete attenuation insulin-dependent increase level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activation phosphofructokinase 2, pyruvate kinase, glucokinase flux glycolysis. Basal rates glucose transport glycolysis affected. PAO also abolished stimulation glycogen synthesis amino-acid transport decrease glycogenolysis evoked insulin. 20-fold activation insulin receptor tyrosine kinase insulin was, however, reduced PAO. data suggest differentiated hepatocytes insulin signal transduction involves vicinal sulhydryls located post-receptor step.
