 Unequal transmission nutritive signaling cell division establishes fate disparity sibling lymphocytes, asymmetric signaling becomes organized understood. show receptor-associated class phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling activity, indexed phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) staining, spatially restricted microtubule-organizing center subsequently one pole mitotic spindle activated B lymphocytes. Asymmetric PI3K activity co-localizes polarization antigen receptor components implicated class PI3K signaling facultative glucose transporters whose trafficking PI3K dependent whose abundance marks cells destined differentiation.
