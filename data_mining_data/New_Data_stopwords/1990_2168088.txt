 alterations specific activity and/or isozyme pattern hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase studied tissue specimens 26 patients lipoblastic tumors 28 patients tumors neurogenic origin. Although biochemical data demonstrated activities enzymes studied elevated specimens malignant tumors, differences activity hexokinase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase measured benign malignant neurogenic tumors significant. malignant tumors, especially neurogenic origin, isozyme pattern pyruvate kinase showed shift towards K-type subunits.
