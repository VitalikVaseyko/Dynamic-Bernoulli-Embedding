 Proteins genes involved recovery heat-injured Salmonella Enteritidis investigated. Salmonella Enteritidis cells cultured overnight tryptic soy broth (TSB; nonselective medium) suspended citric acid-disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 6). heat treatment 55 degrees C 15 min, culturable counts measured tryptic soy agar (TSA; nonselective medium) decreased 10(8) 10(7) CFU/ml. hand, culturable counts measured desoxycholate-hydrogen sulfite-lactose (DHL) agar (selective medium) decreased 10(8) 10(4) CFU/ml treatment. results suggest 99.9% Salmonella Enteritidis detected TSA injured recoverable. injured Salmonella Enteritidis incubated TSB, culturable count measured TSA increase 2 h, whereas DHL agar increased incubation 30 min. incubation 2 h, culturable count measured DHL agar reached similar level TSA, indicating Salmonella Enteritidis recovered. two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed elongation factor G (FusA) pyruvate kinase (PykF) specifically increased cells heat treatment recovery cells. levels transcription 86 stress-inducible genes also investigated reverse transcription PCR. Nineteen heat-inducible (clpB, clpX, degP, dnaJ, fkpA, ftsJ, gapA, hflB, hslJ, hslU, hslV, htpG, htrA, lon, mopA, mopB, mreB, rpoE, ppiD), 12 oxidative-stress DNA damage-inducible (ahpC, ahpF, fldB, fur, grxA, dinF, katG, mutM, recA, soxR, trxC, zwf) genes transcribed extensively recovery TSB. results obtained study used develop media culture conditions promote recovery detection food poisoning bacteria, including injured cells food products.
