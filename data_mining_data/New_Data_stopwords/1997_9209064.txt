 interaction Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase Mck1 pyruvate kinase (Pyk1) detected using two-hybrid method. Purified Mck1 able phosphorylate purified Pyk1 Ser vitro. Pyruvate kinase activity elevated mck1 delta cells. Several phenotypes mck1 delta mutants similar observed cells overexpressing PYK1. Co-overexpression MCK1 suppressed phenotypes associated PYK1 overexpression. results indicate Mck1 negatively regulates pyruvate kinase activity, possibly direct phosphorylation.
