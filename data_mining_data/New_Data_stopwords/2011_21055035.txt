 OBJECTIVE: explore cell culture techniques amplification oval cells preservation simultaneously stem cell characteristics. METHODS: Oval cell line OC3 cultured RPMI 1640 supplemented 15% fetal bovine serum 20 microg/L EGF. Cells harvested every 5 passages examined biomarkers including OV-6, c-kit, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, placental form glutathione-S-transferase (GST-P), pyruvate kinase M(2), pyruvate kinase L albumin using techniques including RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, enzymo-cytochemistry. RESULTS: OC3 cell lines could amplified abundantly in-vitro associating expression infant liver cell markers various level, including OV-6, c-kit, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, GST-P, pyruvate kinase M(2), expression mature hepatocyte markers detected including pyruvate kinase L albumin. CONCLUSIONS: Amplification OC3 cells preservation stem cell phenotype high proliferation index achieved 79(th) passages culturing RPMI 1640 supplemented 15% fetal bovine serum 20 microg/L EGF.
