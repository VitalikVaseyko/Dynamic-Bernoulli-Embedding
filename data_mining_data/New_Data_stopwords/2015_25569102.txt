 Changes cellular metabolism integral property malignant potential cancer cells. Already 1930s, Otto Warburg observed tumor cells preferably utilize glycolysis lactate fermentation energy production, rather mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation dominating normal cells, phenomenon today known Warburg effect. Even though many tumor types display high degree aerobic glycolysis, still retain activity energy-producing metabolic pathways. One exception seems clear cell variant renal cell carcinoma, ccRCC, activity pathways glycolysis shown reduced. makes ccRCC promising candidate use glycolytic inhibitors treatment disease. However, studies far addressed issue. report, show strikingly reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity primary human ccRCC cells, resulting enhanced sensitivity glycolytic inhibition 3-Bromopyruvate (3BrPA). effect largely absent established ccRCC cell lines, finding highlights importance using biologically relevant models search new candidate cancer therapies. 3BrPA markedly reduced ATP production primary ccRCC cells, followed cell death. data suggest glycolytic inhibitors 3BrPA, shown well tolerated vivo, analyzed possible development selective treatment strategies patients ccRCC.
