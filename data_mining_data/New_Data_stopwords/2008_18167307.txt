 Giardia lamblia early branching eukaryotic microorganism derives metabolic energy primarily anaerobic glycolysis. organisms, glycolysis catalyzed pyruvate kinase (PK), allowing generation two ATP molecules one molecule pyruvate. Giardia PK pyrophosphate-dependent pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), catalyzes generation five ATP molecules pyruvate pyrophosphate-dependent glycolysis offers potential selective advantage. order evaluate importance pyrophosphate-dependent glycolysis, used ribozyme-mediated cleavage PPDK transcript decrease PPDK transcript levels 20% normal. accompanying decrease PPDK enzyme activity decreased ATP levels 3% normal increased glycogen deposition, confirming importance pyrophosphate-mediated glycolysis previously suggested cell lysate studies. PPDK found vertebrates, specific inhibitors may useful treatment infections caused anaerobic protists depend pyrophosphate-dependent glycolysis.
