 nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) known critical role metabolic syndrome. Here, show direct regulators family pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) genes, whose products act metabolic homeostats sensing hunger satiety levels key metabolic tissues modulating activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Mis-regulation tightly controlled network may lead hyperglycemia. human embryonal kidney cells found mRNA expression PDK2, PDK3 PDK4 direct primary control PPAR ligands, normal mouse kidney tissue Pdk2 Pdk4 PPAR targets. Both, treatment HEK cells PPARbeta/delta-specific siRNA genetic disruption Pparbeta/delta gene mouse fibroblasts resulted reduced expression Pdk genes abolition induction PPARbeta/delta ligands. findings suggest PPARbeta/delta key regulator PDK genes, particular PDK4/Pdk4 gene. silico analysis human PDK genes revealed two candidate PPAR response elements PDK2 gene, five PDK3 gene two PDK4 gene, none PDK1 gene. seven sites could demonstrate PPARbeta/delta ligand responsiveness context chromatin region simultaneous association PPARbeta/delta functional partner proteins, retinoidXreceptor, co-activator mediator proteins phosphorylated RNA polymerase II. conclusion, PDK2, PDK3 PDK4 primary PPARbeta/delta target genes humans underlining importance receptor control metabolism.
