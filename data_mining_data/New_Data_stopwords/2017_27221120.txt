 purpose study determine whether plasma lactate skeletal muscle glucose regulatory pathways, specifically PDH dephosphorylation, impaired hyperinsulinemic conditions middle- older-aged individuals determine whether exercise training could improve key variables responsible skeletal muscle PDH regulation. Eighteen young (19-29 yr; n = 9 males 9 females) 20 middle- older-aged (57-82 yr; n = 10 males 10 females) individuals underwent 2-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Plasma samples obtained baseline 30, 50, 90, 120 min analysis lactate, skeletal muscle biopsies performed 60 min analysis protein associated glucose metabolism. response insulin, plasma lactate elevated aged individuals normalized insulin action. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation skeletal muscle PDH serine sites 232, 293, 300 decreased young individuals only. Changes insulin-stimulated PDH phosphorylation positively related changes plasma lactate. age-related differences observed skeletal muscle phosphorylation LDH, GSK-3alpha, GSK-3beta response insulin PDP1, PDP2, PDK2, PDK4, MPC1 total protein. Twelve weeks endurance- strength-oriented exercise training improved insulin-stimulated PDH dephosphorylation, related reduced lactate response. findings suggest impairments insulin-induced PDH regulation sedentary aging population contribute impaired glucose metabolism exercise training effective intervention treating metabolic inflexibility.
