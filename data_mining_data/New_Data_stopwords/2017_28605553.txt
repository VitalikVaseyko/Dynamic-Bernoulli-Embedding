 Genetic factors associated susceptibility many infectious diseases may determinants clinical progression. Gene copy number variation (CNV) shown associated phenotypes numerous diseases, including malaria. quantified gene copy numbers pyruvate kinase, liver, red blood cell (PKLR) gene well Fcgamma receptor 2A Fcgamma receptor 2C (FCGR2A, FCGR2C) Fcgamma receptor 3 (FCGR3) genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays Gabonese children severe (n = 184) mild (n = 189) malaria healthy Gabonese white individuals (n = 76 each). means PKLR, FCGR2A, FCGR2C, FCGR3 copy numbers significantly higher among children severe malaria compared mild malaria (P < .002), indicating surplus copies genes significantly associated malaria severity. Copy numbers FCGR2A FCGR2C genes significantly lower (P = .005) Gabonese individuals compared white individuals. conclusion, CNV PKLR, FCGR2A, FCGR2C, FCGR3 genes associated malaria severity, results provide evidence role CNV host responses malaria.
