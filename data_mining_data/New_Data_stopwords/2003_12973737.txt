 performed proteomic analysis monocytes primed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) vitro, using two-dimensional gels stained Coomassie blue. found 16 proteins approximately 500 detected either increased decreased abundance result priming LPS (14 P </= 0.05). proteins identified comparing masses tryptic peptides known proteins, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry SWISS-PROT database. Identities confirmed matching sequence several tryptic peptides, using liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry. increases protective enzymes superoxide dismutase catalase, four calgranulins, cytokine pre-B cell enhancing factor, annexin 2, macrophage capping protein, transketolase, pyruvate kinase, serine/threonine protein kinase 10. Proteins decreased abundance integrin alpha-IIB, protein disulfide isomerase, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase. Many altered proteins interesting functions inflammation.
