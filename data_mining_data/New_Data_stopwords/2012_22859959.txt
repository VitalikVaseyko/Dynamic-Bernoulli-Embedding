 glycolytic profile unifies group pheochromocytomas paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) distinct underlying gene defects, including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) mutations. Nevertheless, tumor aggressiveness distinct: PHEOs/PGLs metastasize rarely VHL-, frequently SDHB-patients. date, molecular mechanisms causing aggressive phenotype SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs remain largely unknown. Recently, however, excellent model study aggressive PHEOs (mouse tumor tissue (MTT) cells) developed mouse PHEO cells (MPC). employed model proteomics based approach identify changes characteristic tumor aggressiveness, explored homogeneous set human SDHB- VHL-PHEOs/PGLs. increase glucose transporter 1 VHL, hexokinase 2 VHL SDHB, confirmed glycolytic profile. agreement cell model support decoupling glycolysis, Krebs cycle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), SDHB tumors showed increased lactate dehydrogenase levels. SDHB-PGLs OXPHOS complex activity increased complex III and, expected, decreased complex II. Moreover, protein mRNA expression tested OXPHOS-related genes higher SDHB- VHL-derived tumors. Although direct evidence increased reactive oxygen species production, elevated superoxide dismutase 2 expression may reflect elevated oxidative stress SDHB-derived PHEOs/PGLs. first time, show despite dysfunction complex II evidence glycolytic phenotype, Warburg effect seem fully apply SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs respect decreased OXPHOS. addition, present evidence increased LDHA SOD2 expression SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs, proteins proposed promising therapeutic targets cancers. study provides new insight pathogenic mechanisms aggressive human PHEOs/PGLs, may lead identifying new diagnostic prognostic markers near future.
