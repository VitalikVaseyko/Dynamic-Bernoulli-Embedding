 isozyme pattern pyruvate kinase canine erythrocytes changes following birth. changes followed electrophoretic, immunologic, kinetic measurements isozymes. birth, mixture isozymes present consisting M2 isozyme hybrid molecules containing M2 R subunits. increasing animal age, content M2 subunits decreases content R subunits increases. 6 months age, isozyme pattern indistinguishable adult erythrocytes contain R tetramer. conclude switch erythrocyte pyruvate kinase gene expression first 6 months postnatural life. existence hybrid molecules switch indicates M2 R genes expressed within erythroid precursor cell. developmental changes erythrocyte pyruvate kinase consistent role enzyme regulation oxygen-transport function canine hemoglobin 2,3-diphosphoglycerate postnatal period.
