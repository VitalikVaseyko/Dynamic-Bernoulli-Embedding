 dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2 component) 60-mer assembled via COOH-terminal domain exterior E1-binding domain two lipoyl domains (L2 L1) sequentially connected mobile linker regions. E2 facilitates markedly enhanced function pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP). Human E2 structures prepared one lipoyl domain (L1 L2) alanines substituted sites lipoylation (Lys-46 L1 Lys-173 L2). L2 domain lipoyl group shown essential markedly enhanced PDP function required greatly up-regulated PDK function. complete absence L1 domain reduced enhancements activities maximal effector-stimulated PDK activity acetylation L2. nonlipoylated L2 present, lipoylated L1 supported lesser enhancement PDK function significant stimulation upon acetylation L1. Prevention L1 lipoylation K46AE2 removed competitive L1 role enhanced L2-facilitated PDK activity beyond native E2 PDK activity measured absence presence stimulatory effectors. Thus, E2-L2 domain paramount role facilitating enhanced PDK PDP function inclusion E2-L1 domain, even noninteracting (nonlipoylated) form, contributes marked elevation activities.
