 Aromatic amino acids precursors numerous plant secondary metabolites diverse biological functions. Many secondary metabolites already used active pharmaceutical nutraceutical ingredients, numerous exploratory studies compounds promising applications. p-Coumaric acid derived aromatic amino acids and, besides valuable chemical building block, serves precursor biosynthesis many secondary metabolites, polyphenols, flavonoids, polyketides. developed p-coumaric acid-overproducing Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain. First, reduced by-product formation knocking phenylpyruvate decarboxylase ARO10 pyruvate decarboxylase PDC5. Second, different versions feedback-resistant DAHP synthase chorismate mutase overexpressed. Finally, identified shikimate kinase another important flux-controlling step aromatic amino acid pathway overexpressing enzymes Escherichia coli, homologous pentafunctional enzyme Aro1p bifunctional chorismate synthase-flavin reductase Aro2p. highest titer p-coumaric acid 1.93 +/- 0.26 g L(-1) obtained, overexpressing tyrosine ammonia-lyase TAL Flavobacterium johnsoniaeu, DAHP synthase ARO4(K229L), chorismate mutase ARO7(G141S) E. coli shikimate kinase II (aroL) Deltapdc5Deltaaro10 strain background. knowledge highest reported titer aromatic compound produced yeast. developed S. cerevisiae strain represents attractive platform host production p-coumaric-acid derived secondary metabolites, flavonoids, polyphenols, polyketides.
