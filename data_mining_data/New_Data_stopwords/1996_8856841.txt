 pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex undergoes reversible phosphorylation catalyzed PDH kinase (inactivating) PDH phosphatase (activating). skeletal muscle, decreased proportion PDH complex active, nonphosphorylated form (PDHa) limits glucose oxidation promotes conversion pyruvate lactate. Increased lactate formation accompanying hyperlactatemia frequent metabolic complication sepsis. time course inactivation PDH complex skeletal muscle sepsis contrasted changes PDHa sterile inflammation 3,7, 14 days following implantation foreign body nidus. Total PDH complex activity altered conditions examined. Sepsis, sterile inflammation, caused reduction muscle PDHa measured 3 7 days following induction sepsis. inhibition muscle PDHa sepsis associated sustained hyperlactatemia. PDH kinase activity measured extracts mitochondria enhanced twofold period. Fourteen days induction sepsis, differences PDHa plasma lactate concentrations septic rats compared either control sterile inflammation. Furthermore, PDH kinase activity decreased values observed control values. results consistent hypothesis reduced PDHa skeletal muscle sepsis responsible, part, hyperlactatemia characteristic septic hypermetabolism. Furthermore, results provide evidence decrease PDHa results stable stimulation PDH kinase activity.
