 mini review primarily concerned monovalent divalent cation activation pyruvate kinase. preparations pyruvate kinase vertebrate tissue examined require monovalent cations K+ catalysis. However, several microbial preparations activated monovalent cations. fact, E. coli synthesize, depending growth conditions, 2 different forms enzyme; one form activated activated monovalent cations. monovalent cation shown NMR techniques bind within 4-8 divalent cation activator apparently plays direct role catalytic process. kinases, pyruvate kinase requires divalent cation catalysis. Mg+2 optimal physiological reaction, however, Co+2, Mn+2, Ni+2 also activate. divalent cation activation several non-physiological reactions catalyzed pyruvate kinase reviewed. Several lines evidence suggest 2 moles divalent cation required catalytic event. However, specific role atoms catalytic event thoroughly elucidated.
