 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) reported closely correlated proliferation, apoptosis invasion esophageal cancer cells. However, expression pattern clinical significance human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unclear. address problem, immunohistochemistry performed detect expression subcellular localization PDK1 protein 120 paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cancerous adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Then, associations tumor progression patients' prognosis statistically evaluated. that, performed migration invasion assays siRNA-targeted PDK1-transfected cells vitro. result, immunohistochemistry analysis showed PDK1 protein expressed cytoplasm carcinoma cells ESCC tissues, expressed adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Statistical analysis indicated expression level PDK1 protein ESCC tissues significantly higher adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P < 0.001). addition, high PDK1 expression found closely correlated advanced tumor stage (P = 0.006), positive lymph node metastasis (P = 0.01) high histological grade (P = 0.02). Moreover, survival analysis revealed PDK1 overexpression significantly associated shorter overall survival (P = 0.001). multivariate analysis identified PDK1 expression independent prognostic factor ESCC patients. ESCC cell lines, knockdown PDK1 using siRNA inhibited cell migration invasion vitro. findings support PDK1 may contribute aggressive progression ESCC. note, PDK1 may serve effective prognostic marker provide novel therapeutic strategy human ESCC.
