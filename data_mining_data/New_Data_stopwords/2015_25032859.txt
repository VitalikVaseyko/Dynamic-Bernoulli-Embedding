 number studies suggest cancer stem cells essential tumour growth, failure target cells result tumour relapse. population cells shown resistant radiation chemotherapy, essential understand biology identify new therapeutic approaches. Targeting cancer metabolism potential alternative strategy counteract tumour growth recurrence. applied proteomic targeted metabolomic analysis order point main metabolic differences breast cancer cells grown spheres thus enriched cancer stem cells compared cells grown adherent differentiating conditions. integrated approach allowed us identify metabolic phenotype associated stem-like condition shows breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) shift mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation towards fermentative glycolysis. Functional validation proteomic metabolic data provide evidences increased activities key enzymes anaerobic glucose fate pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, lactate dehydrogenase glucose 6-phopshate dehydrogenase cancer stem cells well different redox status. Moreover, show treatment 2-deoxyglucose, well known inhibitor glycolysis, inhibits BCSC proliferation used alone shows synergic effect used combination doxorubicin. conclusion, suggest inhibition glycolysis may potentially effective strategy target BCSCs.
