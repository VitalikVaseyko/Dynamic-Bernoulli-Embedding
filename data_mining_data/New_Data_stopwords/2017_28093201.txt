 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) progressive vascular disease characterized increased pulmonary arterial pressure vasoconstriction structural remolding pulmonary arterioles. Recent clinical experimental studies discovered relationship metabolic alterations pathogenesis PAH. primary metabolic alteration, previously demonstrated various cancers, gradual change energy generated complete aerobic cellular respiration solely "aerobic glycolysis," termed "Warburg effect." Understanding Warburg effect metabolic dysregulation interaction inflammatory mechanisms pathogenesis PAH provided valuable explanation disease guided formulation new clinical treatments molecular level.
