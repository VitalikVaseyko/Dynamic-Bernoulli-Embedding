 Isoelectrofocusing studies mouse tissue extracts show mice pyruvate kinase isozyme pattern similar rat. Moreover, electrofocusing kinetic assays conducted liver extracts normal mice mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumors show latter higher proportion fetal K-isozyme pyruvate kinase. Serial injection supernatant remaining centrifugation homogenized tumor cells 100,000 x g, phenolic extracts latter, produced similar shift liver isozyme pattern involves decrease L-isozyme activity increase K-isozyme activity. However, increase activity K-isozyme appears specific response injection extracts. presence specific factor extracts confirmed observation similar extracts prepared normal adult tissues increase activity K-isozyme. hand, phenolic extracts fetal mice increase K-isozyme activity injections serum tumor-bearing mice cell-free ascites fluid. Evidence presented supporting concept factor proteinaceous nature, acts deprepressing synthesis K-isozyme.
