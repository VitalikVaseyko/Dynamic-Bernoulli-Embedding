 effect distribution rest periods efficacy interval sprint training analysed. Ten male subjects, divided random two groups, performed distinct incremental sprint training protocols, muscle load (14 sessions), distribution rest periods varied. 'short programme' group (SP) trained every day 2 weeks, 'long programme' group (LP) trained 6-week period 2-day rest period following training session. volunteers performed 30-s supramaximal cycling test cycle ergometer training. Muscle biopsies obtained vastus lateralis test examine metabolites enzyme activities. training programmes led marked increase (all significant, P < 0.05) enzymatic activities related glycolysis (phosphofructokinase - SP 107%, LP 68% aldolase - SP 46%, LP 28%) aerobic metabolism (citrate synthase - SP 38%, LP 28.4% 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase - SP 60%, LP 38.7%). However, activity creatine kinase (44%), pyruvate kinase (35%) lactate dehydrogenase (45%) rose significantly (P < 0.05) SP. end training programme, SP suffered significant decrease anaerobic ATP consumption per gram muscle (P < 0.05) glycogen degradation (P < 0.05) post-training test, failed improve performance. contrast, LP showed marked improvement performance (P < 0.05) although without significant increase anaerobic ATP consumption, glycolysis glycogenolysis rate. results indicate high-intensity cycling training 14 sessions improves enzyme activities anaerobic aerobic metabolism. changes affected distribution rest periods, hence shorter rest periods produce larger increase pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase. However, performance improve short training programme include days recovery, suggests muscle fibres suffer fatigue injury.
