 Starvation increased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase activity extracts freshly excised rat soleus 2.2-fold (from 0.6 min-1 fed rats 1.31 min-1 48-h-starved rats). fed rats, activities unchanged following 24 h culture medium 199, increased 2.1-fold 24 h culture 50 microM dibutyryl cAMP plus 1 mM n-octanoate 1.6-1.7-fold either agent alone. Approx. 70% increase PDH kinase induced starvation lost following 24 h culture medium 199; loss prevented 50 microM dibutyryl cAMP plus 1 mM n-octanoate. cAMP concentrations fresh soleus muscle 1 nmol/g (fed rats) 1.6 nmol/g (starved rats). 20-60 min culture fed-starved difference disappeared [cAMP] fell 0.4 nmol/g. Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) increased cAMP 3-fold; increase maintained throughout 24 h culture, readily reversed 30 min 24 h culture 60-min incubation CGRP-free medium. Starvation rat (48 h) effect sensitivity soleus towards [cAMP]-increasing effect CGRP. concluded culture may reverse effects starvation PDH kinase activity lowering cAMP removal vivo effects circulating free fatty acids; starvation CGRP detectable long-term effects cAMP system soleus muscle.
