 Exercise tests carried well days 128 248 370-day head-down tilt study. test subjects, took part study, divided two groups used different regimens countermeasures (drugs exercise). exercise tests following serum parameters measured: lactate, pyruvate, glucose, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, lactate dehydrogenase, alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase. Decrease delayed increase concentration energy substrates (nonesterified fatty acids triglycerides) standard exercise test metabolic manifestation deconditioning changes induced head-down tilting. Insufficient supply working human body readily utilizable lipid substrates causes inadequate activation energy forming enzymes excessive buildup metabolites, i. e. lactate pyruvate. efficacy corrective prophylactic measures verified biochemical data.
