 work, describe use rule 3 fragment-based strategies biochemical screening data 1100 in-house, small, low molecular weight fragments. sequential combination silico fragment hopping fragment linking based S160/Y161/A162 hinge residues hydrogen bonding interactions leads identification novel 1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-1H-indazol class Phosphoinositide-Dependent Kinase-1 (PDK1) inhibitors. Consequent SAR follow-up screening data led discovery two potent PDK1 inhibitors: compound 32 35, IC50 80nM 94nM, respectively. biological evaluation showed that, low nanomolar concentration, drug potent ability inhibit phosphorylation AKT p70S6, selectively kill cancer cells mutations PTEN PI3K. microarray data showed DUSP6, DUSP4, FOSL1 down-regulated sensitive cell lines compound treatment. vivo test showed 35 significantly inhibit tumor growth without influencing body weight growth. results suggest compounds, especially 35, merit pre-clinical evaluation.
