 Gaucher disease (GD), caused deficiency lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA), common human glycolipid storage disease. incidence disease particularly high Ashkenazi Jewish population, carrier frequency 0.068. 1226A-->G 84GG mutations two predominant disease-causing alleles. investigated association various mutations GBA gene different alleles highly polymorphic site adjacent pyruvate kinase (PKLR) gene. Ninety-seven unrelated type GD patients various genotypes studied determine genotype PKLR gene trinucleotide repeat polymorphism. One hundred 104 (96%) alleles carrying 1226G mutation also carried A1 allele PKLR gene, present 6.7% control population. calculated linkage disequilibrium 1226G A1 allele PKLR gene 0.957. Mutation 84GG found uniquely associated PKLR A6 allele, linkage disequilibrium 1.00. association several less frequent GD mutations PKLR alleles also studied. results support hypothesis 1226G 84GG mutations Ashkenazi Jewish population originated single founder. studies association 1226G 84GG mutations PKLR alleles European non-Jewish GD patients could help study chronological order mutations may shed light history Ashkenazi Jews past two millennia.
