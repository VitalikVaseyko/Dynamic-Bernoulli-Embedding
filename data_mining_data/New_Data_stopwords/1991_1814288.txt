 Expression TGF-alpha mRNA, correlates well ability cells condition medium EGF-like activity, clonally segregates best tumorigenicity among several single phenotypes considered study. results unreported studies analyzed quantitative relationships expression selected phenotypes tumorigenicity, suggest elevated expression myc TGF-alpha mRNAs interact associations tumor yield. results suggest elevated myc expression sensitizes hepatic epithelial cells possible tumorigenic action TGF-alpha. observation may explain correlation qualitative expression TGF-alpha tumorigenicity, described here, perfect. Conventionally applied markers transformation hepatocytes vivo cultured liver epithelial cells vitro studied -histochemical expression GGT, ability grow medium containing low levels calcium, ability grow soft agar- clonally segregated tumorigenicity poorly liver epithelial cells transformed vitro. conclude phenotypes adequate markers determining lineage hepatic epithelial neoplasms (including, probably hepatocellular cancers arising vivo). study appears first attempt analyze clonally association markers tumorigenicity, quantify sensitivity, specificity, predictive value associations. study suggests relatively weak associations phenotypes tumorigenicity may related stronger associations expression TGF-alpha, property strongly associated tumorigenicity. Expression TGF-alpha strongly associated expression GLC, example, GLC phenotype tumorigenicity. least GLC, autocrine stimulation TGF-alpha likely, since EGF increases growth WB cells low calcium medium. observation may explain perfect correlation expression TGF-alpha GLC. EGF also stimulates lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase WB cells. However, quantitative correlation GGT activity TGF-alpha less strong. Thus, data studies suggest tumorigenic phenotype cultured hepatic epithelial cells intimately dependent expression TGF-alpha gene, possibly producing autocrine stimulation growth via cells' EGF receptors. simple view potential relationship TGF-alpha expression tumorigenicity liver epithelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
