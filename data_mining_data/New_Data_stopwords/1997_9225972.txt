 Mutations glucocerebrosidase (GBA) prosaposin (PSAP) genes responsible Gaucher disease, prevalent sphingolipidosis. Somatic cell hybrid analysis situ hybridization experiments localized GBA gene 1q21 PSAP gene 10q21-q22. performed pairwise multi-point linkage analyses two genes several highly polymorphic markers Genethon human linkage map. results show six markers cosegregate GBA gene (Zmax = 8.73 theta = 0.00 marker D1S2714) define 3.2-cM interval D1S305 D1S2624 probable location gene. Three markers (D1S2777, D1S303, D1S2140), well gene encoding pyruvate kinase (PKLR), contained single YAC clone together GBA gene. new polymorphism identified within PSAP gene (C16045T) used linkage studies. multi-point analysis places gene 9.8-cM interval D10S1688 D10S607. fine localization genes provides useful tool cosegregation analysis, indirect molecular diagnosis, population genetic studies.
