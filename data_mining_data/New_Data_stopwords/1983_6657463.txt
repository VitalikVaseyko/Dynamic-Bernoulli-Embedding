 alterations activity patterns representative enzymes energy metabolism investigated superficial (white) deep (red) portions fast vastus lateralis muscle adult rat response prolonged endurance training. found following 15 weeks extreme training (final running duration: 210 min per day, 27 m/min 15 degree grade), increases activities marker enzymes citric acid cycle (citrate synthase), beta-oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase), ketone body utilization (3-ketoacid CoA transferase) well glutamate pyruvate transaminase occurred regions muscle, greatest increase observed superficial portion (2.6-4.2-fold). Pronounced increases also seen hexokinase showed highest activities 7 weeks training. Conversely, decreases noted various glycogenolytic, glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes (phosphorylase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase fructose-1,6-diphosphatase). Reduction activities enzymes pronounced deep portion muscle. results demonstrate fundamental rearrangement energy metabolism muscle response prolonged, high intensity training. case deep portion vastus lateralis muscle, shown composed large percentage fast oxidative-glycolytic fibres (FOG), enzyme profile becomes similar slow oxidative (SO) fibre. superficial portion contains predominantly fast glycolytic fibres (FG), enzyme profile becomes similar FOG fibres.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
