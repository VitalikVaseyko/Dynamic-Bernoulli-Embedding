 OBJECTIVE: Based rodent studies, examined hypothesis increased adipose tissue (AT) mass obesity without adequate support vascularization might lead hypoxia, macrophage infiltration, inflammation. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: Oxygen partial pressure (AT pO2) temperature abdominal (9 lean 12 overweight/obese men women) measured direct insertion polarographic Clark electrode. Body composition measured dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, insulin sensitivity measured hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Abdominal subcutaneous tissue used staining, quantitative RT-PCR, chemokine secretion assay. RESULTS: pO2 lower overweight/obese subjects lean subjects (47 +/- 10.6 vs. 55 +/- 9.1 mmHg); however, level pO2 activate classic hypoxia targets (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]). pO2 negatively correlated percent body fat (R = -0.50, P < 0.05). Compared lean subjects, overweight/obese subjects 44% lower capillary density 58% lower VEGF, suggesting rarefaction (capillary drop out). might due lower peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma1 higher collagen VI mRNA expression, correlated pO2 (P < 0.05). clinical importance, pO2 negatively correlated CD68 mRNA macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha secretion (R = -0.58, R = -0.79, P < 0.05), suggesting lower pO2 could drive inflammation obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Adipose tissue rarefaction might lie upstream low pO2 inflammation obesity. results suggest novel approaches treat dysfunctional found obesity.
