 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency iron-loading anaemia characterized chronic haemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis requirement blood transfusion cases. studied 11 patients 10 unrelated families found nine different disease-causing PKLR mutations. Two mutations - point mutation c.878A>T (p.Asp293Val) frameshift deletion c.1553delG (p.(Arg518Leufs*12)) - previously described literature. frameshift deletion associated unusually severe phenotype involving neonatal hyperferritinaemia typical PK deficiency. disease-causing mutations genes associated haemochromatosis could found. Inappropriately low levels hepcidin respect iron loading detected PK-deficient patients increased ferritin, confirming predominant effect accelerated erythropoiesis hepcidin production. Although levels putative hepcidin suppressor, growth differentiation factor-15, increased PK-deficient patients, negative correlation hepcidin found. result indicates existence another as-yet unidentified erythroid regulator hepcidin synthesis PK deficiency.
