 Insulin gene therapy requires insulin secretion coupled metabolic requirements. end, developed insulin transgene whose transcription stimulated glucose inhibited insulin. Glucose- insulin-sensitive promoters constructed inserting glucose-responsive elements (GlREs) rat L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene insulin-sensitive, liver-specific, rat insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) promoter. Glucose (5 25 mM) stimulated, insulin (10-10 10-7 M) inhibited, luciferase expression driven promoters primary cultured rat hepatocytes. capacity transfected hepatocytes secrete mature, biologically active insulin demonstrated using human proinsulin cDNA (2xfur), modified allow protein processing endogenous endopeptidase activity. Medium conditioned insulin-producing hepatocytes contained greater 300 microU/ml immunoreactive insulin, denaturing SDS-PAGE anti-insulin immunoprecipitate revealed bands mobilities insulin A, B chains. Biological activity hepatocyte-produced insulin demonstrated transfection assay, medium conditioned insulin-producing hepatocytes exerted effect similar 10-7 insulin. combined glucose- insulin-sensitive promoter modified human proinsulin cDNA create metabolically sensitive insulin transgene ((GlRE)3BP-1 2xfur). H4IIE hepatoma cells stably transfected construct, normal rat hepatocytes (GlRE)3BP-1 2xfur-mediated insulin secretion increased response stimulation glucose. Moreover, capacity decrease insulin production response diminishing glucose exposure also demonstrated. conclude transcriptional regulation insulin production using glucose- insulin-sensitive constructs meets requirements application rodent model insulin gene therapy.
