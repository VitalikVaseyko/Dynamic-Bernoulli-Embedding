 produce two xylanases Trichoderma reesei grown glucose, recombinant strains carry either xyn1 xyn2 (xylanase II [XYN XYN II]-encoding) structural genes expression signals homologous pki1 (pyruvate kinase-encoding) gene constructed. two types transformants secreted XYN II, respectively, growth glucose, demonstrated sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunostaining. corresponding specific xylanase activities best transformants glucose 76 145 U/mg protein XYN XYN II, respectively, opposed obtained parent strain (26 U/mg protein). related amount biomass formed, however, produced 4 5 U/g, contrast much higher activities (10 12 U/g) growth xylan. ultrastructural location XYN II transformant strain producing highest constitutive XYN II formation (ATX2-12) investigated immunoelectron microscopy compared wild-type strain growing xylan. Cell extracts types transformants grown glucose exhibited higher intracellular xylanase activity parent strain grown xylan. using electron microscopy immunogold labelling, XYN II detected endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi-like vesicles, secretory vesicles, vacuoles, cell walls. immunolabel vacuoles detected preferentially subapical cells. recombinant strain expressed xyn2 pki1 promoter compared parent strain growth xylan, former exhibited less proliferated endoplasmic reticulum smaller number secretory vesicles; however, higher density labelling observed. relationship findings efficacy protein secretion growth glucose discussed.
