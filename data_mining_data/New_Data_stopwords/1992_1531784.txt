 B-CK isozyme cytoplasmic creatine kinase localized distinctly terminal web region intestinal epithelial cell brush border (Keller Gordon: Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton 19:169-179, 1991). Experiments performed determine whether CK energetically coupled myosin II present circumferential ring interrootlet structural domains brush border terminal web. isolated brush borders, ATP-dependent circumferential ring contraction interrootlet myosin solubilization supported either exogenous PEP-pyruvate kinase-based ATP-regeneration system (PEP-PK) addition phosphocreatine endogenous B-CK-based ATP-regeneration system (PCr-B-CK). Addition exogenous hexokinase-glucose ATP-hydrolysis system (HK-G) effectively blocked contraction myosin solubilization PEP-PK assay. contrast, HK-G significant effect PCr-B-CK-supported brush border contraction, although inhibit interrootlet myosin solubilization. Thus, high-energy phosphate supplied phosphocreatine, brush border B-CK imparts circumferential ring myosin selective energetic advantage ATPases. results suggest myosin B-CK functionally coupled brush border circumferential ring, might comprise one end energy circuit supplies energy contraction, colocalization CK myosin brush border interrootlet domain insufficient establish functional coupling.
