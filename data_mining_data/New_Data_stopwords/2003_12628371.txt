 activities NAD- NADP-dependent dehydrogenases creatine kinase compared extracts spermatozoa herring (Clupea harengus), carp (Cyprinus carpio) catfish (Clarias gariepinus). activity malic enzyme herring spermatozoa approximately 5 36 times higher carp catfish spermatozoa. contrast, lactate dehydrogenase activity herring spermatozoa low. Herring spermatozoa possess two isoenzymes lactate dehydrogenase: LDH-A(2)B(2) LDH-B(4). herring spermatozoa isozymes separated, partly purified characterized kinetic physico-chemical properties. pH optima K(m) values pyruvate reduction 7.1, 7.25, 7.6 0.22, 0.07, 0.09 mM LDH-A(4), LDH-A(2)B(2) LDH-B(4), respectively. isoenzymes also different thermostabilities. High activity malic enzyme herring spermatozoa suggests adaptation metabolism high oxygen tension.
