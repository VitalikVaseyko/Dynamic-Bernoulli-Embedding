 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase postulated metabolic signaling enzyme, acts switch glycolysis gluconeogenesis mammalian liver regulating level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. effect overexpressing bifunctional enzyme studied FAO cells transduced recombinant adenoviral constructs either wild-type enzyme double mutant bisphosphatase activity protein kinase phosphorylation site. constructs, mRNA protein overexpressed 150- 40-fold, respectively. Addition cAMP cells overexpressing wild-type enzyme increased S0.5 fructose 6-phosphate kinase 1.5-fold effect overexpressed double mutant. wild-type enzyme overexpressed, decrease fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, even though 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase maximal activity increased 22-fold excess fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase maximal activity. kinase:bisphosphatase maximal activity ratio decreased, indicating overexpressed enzyme phosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Overexpression double mutant resulted 28-fold increase kinase maximal activity 3-4-fold increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. Overexpression form inhibited rate glucose production dihydroxyacetone 90% stimulated rate lactate plus pyruvate production 200%. contrast, overexpression wild-type enzyme enhanced glucose production inhibited lactate plus pyruvate production. results provide direct support fructose 2,6-bisphosphate regulator gluconeogenic/glycolytic pathway flux suggest regulation bifunctional enzyme activities covalent modification important amount protein.
