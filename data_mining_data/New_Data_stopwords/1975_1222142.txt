 Pyruvate kinase isozymic changes studied adult hepatocyte cultures, electrophoretic, kinetic immunological methods. able maintain parenchymal cells normal adult rat liver non-proliferating monolayer cultures 10 days. Hepatocytes appeared contain dominant PK type 4-5 days culture. day 5, PK III type regularly present PK 7 days PK III type always isozyme detected culture. must pointed that, Ouchterlony method sometimes electrophoresis, concentrated extracts freshly isolated hepatocytes starting hepatocyte cultures also contain Pyruvate kinase PK III type. results suggest Pyruvate kinase III present partly repressed adult parenchymal cells becomes derepressed culture.
