 winter syndrome gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata indicates species exposed critically low temperatures Mediterranean aquaculture winter. present study metabolic patterns molecular stress responses cold exposure carried investigate "disease", light recent concept oxygen capacity limited thermal tolerance. metabolic profile fuel oxidation examined determining activities enzymes hexokinase (HK), aldolase (Ald), pyruvate kinase (PK), L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH), citrate synthase (CS), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) heart, red white muscle exposure temperatures 10, 14 18 degrees C. Especially, increase LDH activity combined accumulation L-lactate tissues indicates temperatures 14 degrees C critical Sparus aurata stimulate anaerobic component metabolism. Increase activity HOAD suggests oxidation free fatty acids might contribute ATP turnover low temperatures. expression Hsp70 Hsp90 tissues examined revealed cellular stress response cooling 18 degrees C. light winter temperatures S. aurata cultures around 10 degrees C, data suggest fish exposed stressful conditions low end thermal tolerance window. conditions likely impair aerobic capacity fish, compromise rates growth reproduction may contribute elicit pathological conditions.
