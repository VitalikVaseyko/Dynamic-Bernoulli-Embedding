 increase rate glucose consumption multi-vitamin auxotrophic yeast Torulopsis glabrata. neomycin-resistant mutant N07, activity F1-ATPase decreased roughly 35% glucose consumed per cell increased 38% parent strain, breed based analysis energy metabolic pathway. typical inhibitors F1F0-ATPase, DCCD, NaN3 neomycin, depressed F1-ATPase activity parental strain effect mutant strain. Strain N07 cultured pyruvate fermentation medium containing 100g/L glucose using flask. found rate glucose consumption pyruvate production higher 34% 42.9% mutant parent, respectively. However, rate yield growth (about 24%) mutant lower parent. content intracellular ATP mutant also decreased 23.7% parent. activities key enzymes glycolytic pathway electron transfer chain mutant parent determined. Enzymatic analysis revealed that, compared parent strain CCTCC M202019. activities key enzymes, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mutant N07 increased 63.7%, 28.8% 14.4%, respectively, key enzymes electron transfer chain mutant N07 also increased roughly 10%.
