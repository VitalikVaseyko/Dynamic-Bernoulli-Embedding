 Glycometabolism distinctive aspect energy metabolism breast cancer, key glycometabolism enzymes/pathways (glycolysis, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, pentose phosphate pathway) may directly indirectly affect clinical features. study, analyzed particular correlation altered glycometabolism clinical features breast cancer instruct research clinical treatment. Tissue microarrays containing 189 hollow needle aspiration samples 295 triple-negative breast cancer tissues used test expression M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), p53 immunohistochemistry intensity glycometabolism-related protein evaluated. Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards model used analyze relationship expression factors major clinical features. PKM2, GFPT1, G6PD affect pathologic complete response rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients different ways; pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2) G6PD closely associated molecular subtypes, whereas GFPT1 correlated cancer size. three factors well p53 impacts progression-free survival overall survival triple-negative breast cancer patients. Cancer size shows significant association PKM2 GFPT1 expression, pN stage grade associated PKM2 G6PD expression. study support clinical characteristics reflections specific glycometabolism pathways, relationships may shed light orientation research clinical treatment. expression PKM2, GFPT1, G6PD hazardous factors prognosis: high expression proteins predict worse progression-free survival overall survival triple-negative breast cancer, well worse pathologic complete response rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer. However, p53 appears protective factor patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. four proteins, PKM2, GFPT1, G6PD p53, prognostic markers breast cancer. correlation among suggests may crosstalk four proteins breast cancer.
