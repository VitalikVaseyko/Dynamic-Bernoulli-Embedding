 INTRODUCTION: hypothesis brief intermittent exercise-induced increases human skeletal muscle metabolic mRNA dependent relative workload investigated. METHODS: Trained (n = 10) untrained (n = 8) subjects performed exhaustive intermittent cycling exercise (4 x 4 min 85% VO(2peak), interspersed 3 min). Trained subjects also performed intermittent exercise absolute workload untrained subjects, corresponding 70% VO(2peak) (n = 6). RESULTS: Exercise 85% V(O2peak) elevated (P < 0.001) venous plasma lactate 10.1 +/- 0.4 10.8 +/- 0.5 mM trained untrained subjects, respectively. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA expression increased (P < 0.001) approximately four- fivefold several hours exercise groups. exercise 70% VO(2peak), venous plasma lactate less (P < 0.001) elevated (3.1 +/- 0.7 mM) PGC-1alpha mRNA content less (P < 0.05) increased (approximately threefold) exercise 85% VO(2peak). Likewise, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 hexokinase II mRNA expressions increased (P < 0.05) exercise performed 85% VO(2peak) trained subjects. Hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha mRNA increased (P < 0.05) 3 h recovery trained subjects, difference 70% 85% VO(2peak) trial. change hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, phosphofructokinase, citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, heart muscle isoforms, mRNA expressions detected exercise trials. CONCLUSIONS: relative intensity brief intermittent exercise major importance exercise-induced increase several mRNA, including PGC-1alpha.
