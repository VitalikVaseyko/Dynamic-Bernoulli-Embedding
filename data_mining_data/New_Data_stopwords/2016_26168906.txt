 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032, glutamic-acid producing actinobacterium, subject feedback inhibition metabolic intermediates aspartic acid 2-oxoglutaric acid, implies importance PEPC replenishing oxaloacetic acid TCA cycle. Here, investigated effects feedback-insensitive PEPC glutamic acid production. single amino-acid substitution PEPC, D299N, found relieve feedback control aspartic acid, 2-oxoglutaric acid. simple mutant, strain R1, D299N substitution PEPC constructed ATCC 13032 using double-crossover chromosome replacement technique. Strain R1 produced glutamic acid concentration 31.0 g/L 100 g/L glucose jar fermentor culture biotin-limited conditions, significantly higher parent, 26.0 g/L (1.19-fold), indicative positive effect desensitized PEPC glutamic acid production. Another mutant, strain DR1, desensitized PEPC PYK-gene deleted mutations, constructed similar manner using strain D1 PYK-gene deleted mutation parent. mutation shown enhance glutamic acid production previous study. Although marginal, strain D1 produced higher glutamic acid, 28.8 g/L, ATCC13032 (1.11-fold). contrast, glutamic acid production strain DR-1 elevated 36.9 g/L, 1.42-fold higher ATCC13032 significantly higher three strains. results showed synergistic effect two mutations glutamic acid production C. glutamicum.
