 frequently stated pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) Warburg effect important cancer development accumulating raw materials macromolecule biosynthesis. However, correlation PKM2 cancer poorly reported. Here, investigated PKM2 expression esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). observed expression PKM2 much higher ESCC control normal tissue, highly associated many clinical features prognosis. Specially, found expression PKM2 closely related differentiation state ESCC, confirmed discovery vitro. result, data indicated PKM2 might useful indicator determining survival patients ESCC. Considering previous researches link among PKM2, Warburg effect, differentiation, study inferred direct roles PKM2 Warburg effect differentiation cancer cells rather providing synthetic intermediates promotion cancer's progression.
