 BACKGROUND: Aerobic glycolysis, namely Warburg effect, main hallmark cancer cells. Mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction proposed one major causes glycolytic shift. hypothesis revisited tumors appear undergo waves gene regulation progression, rely functional mitochondria. framework, role mitochondrial complex still debated, particular respect effect mitochondrial DNA mutations cancer metabolism. aim work provide proof concept functional complex necessary sustain tumor progression. METHODS: Complex I-null osteosarcoma cells complemented allotopically expressed complex subunit 1 (MT-ND1). Complex re-assembly function recovery, also terms NADH consumption, assessed. Clones tested ability grow soft agar generate tumor masses nude mice. Hypoxia levels evaluated via pimonidazole staining hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) immunoblotting histochemical staining. 454-pyrosequencing implemented obtain global transcriptomic profiling allotopic non-allotopic xenografts. RESULTS: Complementation truncative mutation gene encoding MT-ND1, showed functional enzyme required perform glycolytic shift hypoxia response induce Warburg profile vitro vivo, fostering cancer progression. trigger mediated HIF-1alpha, whose stabilization regulated recovery balance alpha-ketoglutarate succinate due recuperation NADH consumption followed complex rescue. CONCLUSION: Respiratory complex essential induction Warburg effect adaptation hypoxia cancer cells, allowing sustain tumor growth. Differently mitochondrial tumor suppressor genes, therefore, complex severe mutation one reported may confer anti-tumorigenic properties, highlighting prognostic values genetic markers cancer.
