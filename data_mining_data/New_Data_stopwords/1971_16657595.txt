 5-second exposure illuminated bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. var. ;Coastal') leaves (14)CO(2), 84% incorporated (14)C recovered aspartate malate. transfer (14)CO(2)-air (12)CO(2)-air continuous illumination, total radioactivity decreased aspartate, increased 3-phosphoglyceric acid alanine, remained relatively constant malate. Carbon atom 1 alanine labeled predominantly, interpreted indicate alanine derived 3-phosphoglyceric acid. activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, alkaline pyrophosphatase, adenylate kinase, pyruvate-phosphate dikinase, malic enzyme bermudagrass leaf extracts distinctly higher fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), reductive pentose phosphate cycle plant. Assays malic enzyme activity indicated decarboxylation malate favored. malic enzyme NADP(+)-specific malic dehydrogenase activity low bermudagrass compared sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.). activities NAD(+)-specific malic dehydrogenase acidic pyrophosphatase leaf extracts similar among plant species examined, irrespective predominant cycle photosynthesis. Ribulose-1, 5-diphosphate carboxylase C(4)-dicarboxylic acid cycle plant leaf extracts 60%, chlorophyll basis, reductive pentose phosphate cycle plants.We conclude enzyme (14)C-labeling studies bermudagrass contains C(4)-dicarboxylic acid cycle pyruvate-phosphate dikinase exist exclusively C(4)-dicarboxylic acid cycle plants, propose C(4)-dicarboxylic acid cycle plants transfer carbon dicarboxylic acid 3-phosphoglyceric acid involves decarboxylation reaction refixation carbon dioxide ribulose-1, 5-diphosphate carboxylase.
