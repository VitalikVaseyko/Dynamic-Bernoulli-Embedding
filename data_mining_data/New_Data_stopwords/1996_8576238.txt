 previously reported ability protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) undergo ATP-dependent autophosphorylation. efforts map modification site hindered low abundance instability labeling. Results presented paper nature phospho-PDI, appears intermediate half-life 2.5-8.8 min ATPase reaction. ATP binds PDI high affinity, Kd 9.66 microM, kinetic parameters KmATP kcat ATPase reaction measured using pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay various conditions. Strikingly, ATPase reaction stimulated presence denatured polypeptides, disulfide oxidization activity PDI affected ATP. However, PDI known participate various unrelated functions endoplasmic reticulum, ATP could involved regulation one these. results discussed light recent findings ATP-chaperone relationships.
