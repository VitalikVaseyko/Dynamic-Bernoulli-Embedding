 effect 1% 21% O(2) upon (14)CO(2) assimilation desert plants exposed 10 90 seconds studied. plants studied divided three groups respect O(2). C(3) plants display usual Warburg effect. changes could observed intensity photosynthesis function O(2) content another group plants (showing signs Crassulacean acid metabolism). still another group plants (C(4) plants) stimulating effect O(2) photosynthesis could detected. C(3) plants, O(2) inhibits processing carbon Calvin cycle intermediates. involvement carbon glycolate pathway fails explain completely inhibiting effect O(2) photosynthesis. assumed O(2) inhibits enzymes Calvin cycle. C(4) plants O(2) stimulates incorporation (14)C malate aspartate. incorporation (14)C intermediates Calvin cycle C(4) plants inhibited much like typical C(3) plants.
