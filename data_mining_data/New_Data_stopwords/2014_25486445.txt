 Since revitalization 'the Warburg effect', great interest mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, cancer perspective also general biomedical science field. center oxidative metabolism, mitochondria metabolic activity tightly controlled meet cellular energy requirements different physiological conditions. One mechanism inducible transcriptional co-regulators PGC1alpha NCOR1, respond various internal external stimuli modulate mitochondrial function. However, activity co-regulators depends interaction transcriptional factors directly bind control downstream target genes. nuclear receptors PPARs ERRs shown key transcriptional factors regulating mitochondrial oxidative metabolism executing inducible effects PGC1alpha NCOR1. review, summarize recent gain-of-function loss-of-function studies PPARs ERRs metabolic tissues discuss unique roles regulating different aspects mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.
