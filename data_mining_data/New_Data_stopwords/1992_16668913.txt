 Short-term changes pyridine nucleotides key metabolites measured onset NO(3) (-) NH(4) (+) assimilation dark N-limited green alga Selenastrum minutum. NH(4) (+) added N-limited cells, NADH/NAD ratio rose immediately NADPH/NADP ratio followed slowly. immediate decrease glutamate 2-oxoglutarate indicates increased flux glutamine synthase/glutamate oxoglutarate aminotransferase. Pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase rapidly activated supply carbon skeletons tricarboxylic acid cycle amino acid synthesis. contrast, NO(3) (-) addition caused immediate decrease NADPH/NADP ratio accompanied increase 6-phosphogluconate decrease glucose-6-phosphate/6-phosphogluconate ratio. changes show increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, indicating oxidative pentose phosphate pathway supplies reductant NO(3) (-) assimilation dark. lag 30 60 seconds increase NADH/NAD ratio NO(3) (-) assimilation correlates slow activation pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Together, results indicate NH(4) (+) assimilation, demand ATP carbon skeletons synthesize amino acid signals activation respiratory carbon flow. contrast, NO(3) (-) assimilation, initial demand carbon respiration reductant lag tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon flow activated response carbon demands amino acid synthesis.
