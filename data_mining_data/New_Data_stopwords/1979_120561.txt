 previous papers reported earlier peak time (PT) radiorespiratory feeding 3'-methyl-4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene(3'-Me-DAB) due activation hexose monophosphate (HMP) pathway together hepatic cell proliferation reflecting toxic effects carcinogen. study, investigated correlation results radiorespiratory levels enzyme activities HMP pathway regenerating rat liver connection hepatic cell proliferation. [3H]Thymidine incorporation rat liver DNA activities hexokinase (HK) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase(G-6-PD) reached maximum 3rd day partial hepatectomy. radiorespirometry using [U-14C] glucose, peak time (PT) much earlier 2nd 3rd day partial hepatectomy. peak height (PH) decreased less 1/2 initial level 2nd, began recover 3rd day. yield value (YV) remained initial level 4 days operation.
