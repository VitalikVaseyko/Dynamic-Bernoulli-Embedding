 OBJECTIVE: investigate gene expression profiles lung adenocarcinoma (LA), tumor adjacent tissue (TAT) fetal lung tissue (FLT) cDNA microarray technique. METHODS: Total RNA LA, TAT FLT extracted purified. cDNA made RT-PCR, labeled Cy5 Cy3 fluorescence probes hybridized whole gene chips. Subsequently, signal images scanned ScanArray 4000 fluorescence scanner analyzed Gene Pix PRO3.0. RESULTS: 4 cases LA TAT, 25 genes screened differences gene expression level, among 3 upregulated 22 downregulated; FLT TAT cases, 316 genes screened out, among 192 upregulated 124 downregulated; 16 genes found differentially expressed genes common LA, TAT FLT, among 12 upregulated 4 downregulated. CONCLUSION: 25 differentially expressed genes LA TAT may related occurrence development lung cancer, 316 genes FLT TAT may related fetal developmental. 16 differentially expressed genes may related initiation lung cancer.
