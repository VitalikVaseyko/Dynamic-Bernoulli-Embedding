 stability various glycolytic enzymes human erythrocytes studied mechanical shaking method. rate denaturation apparently followed first order kinetics. t1/2, shaking time required denature 50% original activity, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase less 1 min; hexokinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, monophosphoglyceromutase 2 13 min; enzymes 30 min. Since t1/2 value enzyme highly reproducible shaking conditions kept constant, parameters may used indicator protein stability solution. mechanical denaturation method may also used remove unstable components mixture proteins different stabilities.
