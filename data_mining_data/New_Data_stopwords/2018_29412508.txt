 Many health effects Lactobacillus acidophilus desirable among adhesion ability vital enhance possibility colonization stabilisation associated gut mucosal barrier. study, growth characteristics adhesion activity L. acidophilus intestine-like pH environment (pH 7.5) identified. number bacteria adhering HT-29 cells found gradual increase trend (pH 5.5-7.5). also led morphological changes L. acidophilus exposure different pH environments. Furthermore, help isobaric tags relative absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis, 207 proteins detected differentially expressed pH 7.5. use GO analysis KEGG analysis indicated three essential pathways related cell envelope peptide-glycan biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism obviously changed. Adhesion related surface protein fmtB PrtP up-regulated pH 7.5 group. moonlight proteins like pyruvate kinase, binds specifically mucin layer inhibits adhesive activity L. acidophilus found down-regulated. results could useful understand adhesion mechanism L. acidophilus adapting gut mucosal barrier intestinal environment. article protected copyright. rights reserved.
