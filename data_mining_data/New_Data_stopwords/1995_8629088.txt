 molecular abnormalities erythroenzymopathies associated hereditary hemolytic anemia determined using molecular techniques. Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency common well-characterized enzyme deficiency involving glycolytic pathway causing hereditary hemolytic anemia. identified six distinct missense mutations form splicing mutation 11 unrelated families homozygous PK deficiency. Mutations located near substrate binding site may change conformation active site, resulting drastic loss activity severe clinical symptoms. now, including genetic defects, 21 missense, 1 nonsense 2 splicing mutations, 2 insertions, 3 deletions determined. G6PD deficiency common metabolic disorder, associated chronic drug- infection-induced hemolytic anemia. date, sixty different mutations identified. Except three kinds variants small gene deletions three nucleotide substitutions, found produced one two nucleotide substitutions. Molecular studies disclosed class 1 variants associated chronic hemolysis mutations surrounding either substrate NADP binding site. Among rare enzymopathies, missense mutations determined glucosephosphate isomerase deficiency, aldolase deficiency, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) deficiency, phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, adenylate kinase deficiency. Compound heterozygous cases missense mutation/nonsense mutation missense mutation/decreased mRNA reported TPI deficiency diphosphoglyceromutase deficiency, respectively. phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency, three kinds 5'-splice junction mutations resulting abnormally spliced PFK-M mRNA identified. exception hemolytic anemia due increased adenosine deaminase activity. basic abnormality appears result overproduction structurally normal enzyme.
