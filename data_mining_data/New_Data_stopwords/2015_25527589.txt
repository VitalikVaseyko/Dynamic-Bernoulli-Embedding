 Energy homeostasis essential process oogenesis, nutrients required suitable embryonic development, recently, studies investigated metabolic activity process. work aims investigation dynamics energy source utilization Rhynchophorus palmarum embryogenesis. this, first evaluated mobilization kinetics lipids glycogen. Thereafter, synthesis RNA, protein, involvement enzyme glycolytic pentose-phosphate pathways. Results showed lipid content decreased contrast lipase activity. total glycogen amounts partly consumed glucose content increased, values remained stable hatching. Total RNA content increased, significant changes total protein content observed. study glycolytic pathway data showed activity hexokinase pyruvate kinase beginning embryogenesis. Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate formed driven pentose-phosphate pathway viewed high activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Finally, results showed mobilization different energy sources together different enzymatic activities important role embryonic development R. palmarum.
