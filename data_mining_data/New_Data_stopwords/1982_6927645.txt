 carcinogens, urethane (URTH), 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) given pregnant mice enhanced permanently activities pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) lungs offspring even well appearance lung tumours. noncarcinogenic analogues phenylurethane (PHUR) pyrene (PYR), effect PK LDH activity. non-carcinogenic pulmonary toxicant Paraquat (PAR) elicited temporary elevation activities enzymes tested. H:M ratio LDH sub-units lung tissue permanently decreased URTH administered transplacentally. PAR caused temporary decrease H:M ratio, PHUR effect isozymic pattern LDH.
