 differences therapeutic effectiveness sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) continuous blood purification (CBP) investigated. order assess different treatment methods, 56 critically ill patients divided two groups, CBP group SLED group. comparison made biochemical indicators, in-hospital duration, hemodynamic parameters, acute physiology chronic health evaluation (APACHE-II), survival, mortality rates. treatment, levels serum creatine kinase isozyme MB (CK-MB), creatine kinase, creatinine, glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase (AST), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (ALT), APACHE II score 1st, 2nd, 7th day treatment groups lower treatment (P < 0.05). statistical differences in-hospital duration, biochemical indicators, APACHE II score, hemodynamic parameters, survival rate mortality rate two groups (P > 0.05). concluded SLED similar hemodynamic stability CBP two methods similar treatment effects critically ill patients. However, noticed SLED relatively economical convenient critically ill patients clinical practice.
