 role calcium signalling specific intracellular calcium signalling pathways regulating skeletal muscle tissue peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator (PGC)-1alpha, hexokinase (HK)II pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4 mRNA examined. Cultured primary rat skeletal muscle cells incubated 6 h caffeine ionomycin. PGC-1alpha mRNA clearly showed greater induction ionomycin, latter chosen main experiments, whereby cells incubated 6 h either ionomycin alone combination either cyclosporin KN-62. PGC-1alpha mRNA level increased (p<0.05) approximately six-fold HKII mRNA content approximately two-fold ionomycin relative corresponding controls, whereas PDK4 mRNA content remained unaffected. Cyclosporin abolished (p<0.05) KN-62 reduced (p<0.1) ionomycin-induced increase PGC-1alpha mRNA. Electrical stimulation vitro incubated rat EDL muscle increased (p<0.05) PGC-1alpha mRNA 2.2-fold 4 h recovery relative resting control, increase absent muscles incubated KN-62 cyclosporin A. present data strongly suggest calcium signalling involved regulating PGC-1alpha HKII genes, PDK4. calcineurin CaMK signalling seem involved calcium- contraction-mediated PGC-1alpha up-regulation skeletal muscle.
