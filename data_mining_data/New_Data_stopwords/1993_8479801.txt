 presence phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31), enzyme branchpoint glycolysis Krebs cycle detected Filaria Molinema dessetae. enzyme previously identified Helminths, far found possess phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32). enzyme level activity comparable pyruvate kinase, relatively less active enzymes malate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase. propose method purification M. dessetae PEP-carboxylase. purified electrophoretic homogeneity, enzyme molecular weight 64 kDa. Kinetic studies indicated carboxylation reaction optimal pH 5.8. enzyme inhibited cations Fe2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+ required presence Mg2+ Mn2+. enzyme thermostable. apparent Km value 2.38 mmol phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylation reaction higher previously reported values. Km value KHCO3 found 1.6 mmol. PEP-carboxylase catalyse reverse reaction.
