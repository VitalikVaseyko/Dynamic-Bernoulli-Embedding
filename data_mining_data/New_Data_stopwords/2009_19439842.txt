 BACKGROUND: Recent studies confirmed alterations isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) provide tumor cells selective growth advantage. AIMS: aim establish mean activity enzyme PK human astrocytomas look trends activity relation histological grade. MATERIALS METHODS: PK (EC 2.7.1.40) activity measured tumor homogenate spectrophotometric rate determination. DeltaAbsorbance 340 nm (A 340 nm ) per minute obtained using maximal linear rate test blank. Enzyme activity estimated presence absence amino acid alanine. RESULTS: mean PK level astrocytomas 3.5 +/- 2.0 mmol/min/mg protein, significantly higher (24%; P < 0.001) compared 2.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/min/mg protein control brain. Highest PK activity noted grade 2 astrocytomas. controls change PK activity presence alanine. grade 2 astrocytomas 7% decrease mean PK activity presence alanine, difference grade 3 astrocytomas 33% grade 4 astrocytomas 61%. tumors becoming malignant graded increase levels PK inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Mean PK activity significantly higher astrocytomas. graded increase level PK inhibition tumors becoming malignant.
