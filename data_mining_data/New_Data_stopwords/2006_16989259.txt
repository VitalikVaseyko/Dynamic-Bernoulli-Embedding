 Cellular physiology metabolism monitored using quasi real-time combination on-line off-line data estimate metabolic fluxes established bioreaction network. utility approach towards optimizing bioreactor operation demonstrated CHO cells cultivated 15 L perfusion reactors 20 x 10(6) cells/mL. Medium composition dilution rates changed obtain several steady states varying glucose glutamine concentrations. cells restored initial culture medium perfusion rate conditions exposed lower glucose glutamine concentrations, pyruvate flux TCA cycle increased 30% pyruvate flux lactate decreased 30%, suggesting steady-state multiplicity. appropriately altering cellular metabolism, perfusion bioreactors operate lower perfusion rates without significant accumulation inhibitory metabolites lactate. Changes glucose, lactate glutamine uptake/production rates significant effects calculation fluxes network. Sensitivity analysis key metabolic fluxes highlighted need accurate reliable real-time sensors. Overall, rapid observation metabolic fluxes valuable tool bioprocess development, monitoring control. framework presented study offers convenient means quasi real-time estimation metabolic fluxes represents step towards realizing potential metabolic flux analysis accelerated bioprocess optimization.
