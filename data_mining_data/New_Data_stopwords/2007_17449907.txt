 Glucose disposal induces signal modulates transcriptional regulation genes involved glycolysis lipogenesis pathways. investigate role glucose metabolism hepatic gene expression independently insulin action, overexpressed glucokinase, limiting enzyme glycolysis pathway, liver streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats. microarray analysis, observed critical genes liver-type pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 enhanced multiple-fold, whereas genes involved mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation Krebs cycle downregulated. Despite increase expression fatty acid synthesis genes presence steatosis, major alterations levels genes involved VLDL assembly secretion, diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1 2 microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, observed. Overall, data suggest gene expression pattern induced glucose metabolism favors fatty acid storage liver rather secretion circulation.
