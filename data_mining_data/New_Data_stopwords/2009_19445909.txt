 rats humans estradiol attenuates neuroendocrine responses hypoglycemia. Since neuroendocrine responses hypoglycemia mediated hypothalamic neurons, assessed estradiol attenuates hypoglycemia-induced gene expression hypothalamus female ovariectomized mice. expected, estradiol-implanted ovariectomized mice exhibited increased plasma estradiol, increased uterine weight, decreased body weight, decreased visceral adiposity, enhanced glucose tolerance decreased plasma insulin. Estradiol-implanted mice exhibited attenuated hypoglycemia-induced gene expression glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) inhibitor kappa beta signaling (IkappaB) hypothalamus liver. Estradiol also attenuated hypoglycemia-induced plasma glucagon, pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC), adrenal c-fos, consistent impaired counterregulatory responses hypoglycemia. addition, estradiol inhibited hypothalamic expression carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1a CPT1c) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), effects would expected enhance accumulation long-chain fatty acids glycolysis. Taken together, findings suggest hypothalamic mechanisms mediating attenuation hypoglycemia-induced neuroendocrine responses.
