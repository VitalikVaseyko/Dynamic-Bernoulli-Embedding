 Reprogrammed metabolism identified emerging hallmark cancer cells. demonstrated fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) rate-limiting enzyme gluconeogenesis plays critical roles tumor initiation progression several cancer types. However, function FBP1 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still clear. study, observed expression FBP1 obviously downregulated cell lines tissues HCC. Downregulation FBP1 HCC tissues correlated lower overall survival rate relatively higher tendency tumor recurrence (n = 224). Silencing FBP1 could significantly promote colony formation, proliferation metastasis HCC cells, ectopic overexpression FBP1 resulted impaired abilities colony formation, proliferation metastasis vitro vivo. Mechanistically, silencing FBP1 facilitated glycolysis HCC cell lines, may responsible aggressiveness HCC cells. found targeting Warburg effect using specific inhibitor FX11 could suppress aggressiveness HCC cells mediated loss FBP1. findings indicate FBP1 appears tumor suppressor HCC. Strategies restore levels activities FBP1 might developed treat patients HCC.
