 Recently, family polyketide inhibitors F(0)F(1)-ATPase, including apoptolidin, ossamycin, oligomycin, shown among top 0.1% cell line selective cytotoxic agents 37, 000 molecules tested 60 human cancer cell lines National Cancer Institute. Many cancer cells maintain high level anaerobic carbon metabolism even presence oxygen, phenomenon historically known Warburg effect. mechanism-based strategy sensitize cells class potent small molecule cytotoxic agents presented. natural products inhibit oxidative phosphorylation targeting mitochondrial F(0)F(1) ATP synthase. Evaluation gene expression profiles panel leukemias revealed strong correlation expression level gene encoding subunit 6 mitochondrial F(0)F(1) ATP synthase (known binding site members class macrolides) sensitivity natural products. Within set leukemia cell lines, comparably strong drug-gene correlations also observed genes encoding two key enzymes involved central carbon metabolism, pyruvate kinase, aspartate aminotransferase. propose simple model mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activated response shift balance aerobic anaerobic ATP biosynthesis. Inhibitors lactate formation carbon flux Embden-Meyerhof pathway significantly sensitized apoptolidin-resistant tumors drug. Nine different cell lines derived human leukemias melanomas, colon, renal, central nervous system, ovarian tumors also sensitized killing apoptolidin.
