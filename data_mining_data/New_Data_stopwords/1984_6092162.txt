 short-term regulation pyruvate kinase rat hepatocytes studied feeding cycle progressive fasting. fed fasted rats, activity ratio pyruvate kinase (V0.5-mMPEP/Vmax) crude extracts directly correlated concentration glucose 1,6-bisphosphate++ hepatocytes. Precipitation enzyme homogenates ammonium sulphate, removes fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, induced groups animals low activity ratio pyruvate kinase remained unchanged whole experiment. results show absence added glucagon hepatocytes, activity pyruvate kinase mainly controlled intracellular level fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Addition glucagon hepatocytes fed fasted rats inactivated pyruvate kinase decreased concentration fructose 1,6-bisphosphate cells. However, crude extracts activity ratio pyruvate kinase fructose 1,6-biphosphate levels higher fed rats starved rats. findings suggest glucagon-induced inactivation pyruvate kinase also depends upon concentration fructose 1,6-biphosphate hepatocytes.
