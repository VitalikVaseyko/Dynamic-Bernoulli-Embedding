 PknJ (Rv2088) serine/threonine protein kinase mycobacteria present Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), gene absent Mycobacterium smegmatis (MS); fast grower nonpathogenic species mycobacteria. heterologous expression MTB-specific PknJ MS altered growth recombinant mycobacteria highlighting one characteristics protein. nature protein confirmed Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) containing antisense copy pknJ resulted increased growth BCG. real-time RNA quantification analysis pointed toward increased expression protein infection THP-1 macrophage cells emphasized protein essential intracellular survival mycobacteria. differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE) data followed mass spectroscopy suggested PknJ involved regulation pyruvate kinase (Rv1617). Since pyruvate kinase (PK) one key enzymes controls glycolytic cycle mycobacteria, looked interaction PknJ extracellular intracellular growth mycobacteria. order identify specific residue(s) involved post-translational modification, phospho-null mutants PK generated, substrate specificities response PknJ assessed kinase assay. findings thus underlined PK activity predominantly dependent threonine residue 94(th) position suggested site may plausible intracellular survival mycobacteria upon phosphorylation PknJ.
