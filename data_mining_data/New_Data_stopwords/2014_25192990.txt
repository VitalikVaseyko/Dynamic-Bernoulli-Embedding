 high growth rate bacterial cultures usually achieved optimizing growth conditions, metabolism bacterium limits maximal growth rate attainable carbon source used. limitation circumvented engineering metabolism bacterium. Acinetobacter baylyi become model organism studies bacterial metabolism metabolic engineering due wide substrate spectrum easy-to-engineer genome. produces naturally storage lipids, wax esters, unique gluconate catabolism lacks gene pyruvate kinase. engineered central metabolism A. baylyi ADP1 favorable gluconate catabolism expressing pyruvate kinase gene (pykF) Escherichia coli. modification increased growth rate cultivated gluconate glucose sole carbon source batch cultivation. engineered cells reached stationary phase carbon sources approximately twice fast control cells carrying empty plasmid produced similar amount biomass. Furthermore, grown either gluconate glucose, pykF expression lead significant accumulation overflow metabolites consumption substrate remained unaltered. Increased growth rate glucose accompanied decreased wax ester production, pykF-expressing cells accumulated significantly storage lipids respect cultivation time.
