 parenchymal hepatocytes isolated adult liver co-cultured epithelial cells, production various plasma proteins hepatocytes preserved much longer conventional culture. study examines metabolic interactions parenchymal hepatocytes epithelial cells maintained co-culture. leakage lactate dehydrogenase hepatocytes co-cultured epithelial cells lower conventional hepatocyte culture. epithelial cells high glycolytic rate provide hepatocytes continual supply lactate. [lactate] lower co-cultures hepatocytes epithelial cells pure epithelial cultures similar density, suggesting lactate clearance hepatocytes. Alanine uptake higher conventional hepatocyte cultures, lack exogenous supply lactate, parenchymal hepatocytes co-culture. Studies pure parenchymal hepatocytes incubated increasing [lactate] suggest lactate utilized preference alanine gluconeogenic substrate hepatocytes co-cultured epithelial cells. Ketogenesis carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity declined slowly hepatocytes co-cultured epithelial cells conventional culture. concluded co-culture model potential long-term studies carbohydrate lipid metabolism.
