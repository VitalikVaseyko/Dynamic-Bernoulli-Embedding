 INTRODUCTION: Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency one common hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemias worldwide clinical manifestations ranging mild severe hemolysis. However, investigation enzymopathy lacking Tunisia. report pioneer investigation PK deficiency among Tunisian cases referred laboratory biological analysis unknown cause hemolytic anemia. METHODS: Two hundred fifty-three patients unknown cause hemolytic anemia addressed laboratory order investigate red blood cells genetic disorders. Red cell enzyme activities measured standard methods, molecular analysis performed DNA sequencing. interpretation mutation effect molecular modeling performed using specific software. RESULTS: Six different PKLR mutations found (c.966-1G>T; c.965+1G>A; c.721G>T; c.1163C>A; c.1456C>T; c.1537T>A), among four described first time. Genotype-phenotype correlations novel missense mutations investigated three-dimensional structure analysis. CONCLUSION: study provides important data PK deficiency among Tunisians. might followed large neonatal screening determine spectrum PK mutations identify potential deficient patients early medical follow-up.
