 generally accepted ATP regulates mitochondrial function AMPK signaling pathway. However, AMPK-independent pathway remains largely unknown. study, investigated ATP surplus negative regulation mitochondrial function focus pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation protein acetylation. PDH phosphorylation induced high fat diet liver obese mice, associated ATP elevation. 1c1c7 hepatoma cells, phosphorylation induced palmitate treatment induction ATP production. phosphorylation associated reduction mitochondria oxygen consumption 4 h treatment. palmitate effect blocked etomoxir, inhibited ATP production suppression fatty acid beta-oxidation. PDH phosphorylation induced incubation mitochondrial lysate ATP vitro without altering expression PDH kinase 2 (PDK2) 4 (PDK4). addition, acetylation multiple mitochondrial proteins induced ATP conditions. Acetyl-CoA exhibited similar activity ATP induction phosphorylation acetylation. data suggest ATP elevation may inhibit mitochondrial function induction phosphorylation acetylation mitochondrial proteins. results suggest AMPK-independent mechanism ATP regulation mitochondrial function.
