 Stress conditions induced rainbow trout readjustment glucosensing response hypothalamus hindbrain sensors respond properly changes glucose levels, demonstrated previous studies. evaluate hypothesis corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) could involved response, incubated hypothalamus hindbrain rainbow trout different glucose concentrations presence different concentrations CRF. conditions, evaluated whether parameters related glucosensing [the levels glucose, glycogen glucose 6-phosphate, activities glucokinase (GK), glycogen synthase (GSase) pyruvate kinase (PK), mRNA abundance transcripts GK, Glut2, Kir.6-like sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)-like] modified presence CRF way comparable observed stress conditions. obtained evidence allowing us suggest CRF could involved interaction stress glucosensing CRF treatment hypothalamus hindbrain vitro induced readjustment glucosensing parameters similar previously observed stress conditions vivo. also previously demonstrated stress elicits alterations food intake parallel readjustment glucosensing systems. Here, provide evidence mRNA abundance several neuropeptides involved regulation food intake, neuropeptide (NPY) cocaine amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), affected CRF treatment, way expression respond changes glucose levels way controls, allowing us suggest food intake response integrated changes peptides known reduced stress could also mediated CRF action glucosensing areas.
