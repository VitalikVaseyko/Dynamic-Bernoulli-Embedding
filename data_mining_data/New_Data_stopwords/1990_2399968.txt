 Primary cultures rabbit proximal tubules, revert glycolytic profile reflected increased activity pyruvate kinase (PK) paralleled increased glucose consumption lactate formation, utilized explore relationship glycolytic metabolism proliferation. Tubules placed serum-free, hormonally defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 5 mM glucose exhibited logarithmic growth beginning day 3 culture. increase PK activity lagged approximately 1 day behind, suggesting reversion glycolysis consequence rather prerequisite cellular proliferation. Tubules cultured 0.5 mM contrasted 25 mM glucose exhibited heightened proliferation reflected increase protein content cell number day 5 culture. heightened proliferation accompanied increased PK activity. day 9, confluency achieved, differences protein content PK activity detected tubules cultured different glucose concentrations. findings indicate low glucose concentration mitogenic renal proximal tubules proliferative process fashion up-regulates activity glycolytic enzyme PK. Furthermore, accelerated growth proceeds presence glucose restriction, energy glycolysis required proliferative process.
