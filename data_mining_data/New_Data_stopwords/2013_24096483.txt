 Post-translational modification (PTM) important step signal transduction transfers chemical groups phosphate, acetyl glycosyl groups one protein another protein. PTMs reversible, normal cells use PTMs 'switch' determine resting proliferating state cells enables rapid tight regulation cell proliferation. cancer cells, activation oncogenes and/or inactivation tumor suppressor genes provide continuous proliferative signals part adjusting state diverse PTMs effector proteins involved regulation cell survival, cell cycle proliferation, leading abnormally fast proliferation cancer cells. addition dysregulated proliferation, 'altered tumor metabolism' recently recognized emerging cancer hallmark. common metabolic phenotype cancer known Warburg effect aerobic glycolysis consists increased glycolysis enhanced lactate production even presence oxygen. Although Otto Warburg observed aerobic glycolysis nearly 90 years ago, detailed molecular mechanisms increased glycolysis regulated oncogenic and/or tumor suppressive signaling pathways remain unclear. review, summarize recent advances revealing signaling pathways reprogram metabolism diverse PTMs provide metabolic advantage cancer cells, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation, tumorigenesis tumor growth.
