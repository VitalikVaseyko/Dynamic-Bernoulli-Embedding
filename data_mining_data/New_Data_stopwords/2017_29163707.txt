 Glycolysis glutaminolysis heavily involved metabolic reprogramming cancer cells. activation oncogenes inactivation tumor suppressor genes marked effect cellular metabolic processes glycolysis glutaminolysis. N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) tumor suppressor gene previous studies demonstrated inhibit growth, proliferation metastasis clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells. However, function NDRG2 ccRCC metabolism remains unknown. present study, NDRG2 significantly inhibited consumption glucose glutamine, well production lactate glutamate ccRCC. NDRG2 significantly suppressed expression glucose transporter 1, hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, glutamine transporter ASC amino acid transporter 2 glutaminase 1 mRNA (by quantitative polymerase chain reaction) protein level (by western blot analysis), key regulators enzymes glycolysis glutaminolysis. Data present study also revealed overexpression NDRG2 suppressed cell proliferation ccRCC vitro vivo, demonstrated colony formation assays, wound healing assay nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment. present findings demonstrate first time NDRG2 acts key inhibitor glycolysis glutaminolysis ccRCC could promising target metabolic treatment ccRCC.
