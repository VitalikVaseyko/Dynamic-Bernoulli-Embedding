 dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) component contains COOH-terminal inner domain (E2I) extended NH2-terminal structure, composed two lipoyl domains (the fragment containing designated E2L) subunit-binding domain (E2B). four domains connected hinge regions. subcomplex, composed oligomer E2 subunits, protein X (which also NH2-terminal lipoyl domain), [pyruvate dehydrogenase]-kinase catalytic basic subunits (Kc Kb, respectively) (i.e. E2.X.KcKb subcomplex), treated Clostridium histolyticum collagenase. E2 subunits selectively cleaved NH2-terminal end E2B domain, releasing E2L fragment. Complete release E2 subunits also released kinase subunits, indicating kinase bound E2L portion E2. residual inner core subcomplex (designated E2IB.X) strong tendency aggregate, reversed heparin (1 mg/ml). E2IB.X subcomplex binds pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) components. E1 component, binds E2B domain, blocked collagenase cleavage E2. evaluated capacity collagenase-treated E2.X.KcKb subcomplex, different portions E2L domains removed, support (in combination excess levels E1 E3 components) overall reaction complex. Loss activity occurred half E2L domains removed. delay sharp contrast effect selective removal lipoyl domain protein X, leads immediate decrease activity (Gopalakrishnan, S., Rahmatullah, M., Radke, G.-A., Powers-Greenwood, S. L., Roche, T. E. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 160, 715-721). results suggest multiple lipoyl domains E2 component service rate-limiting E1 component. E2L domains removed E2IB.X subcomplex separated free E2L, 10% activity retained overall reaction. Thus, lipoyl domain protein X supported overall reaction complex.
