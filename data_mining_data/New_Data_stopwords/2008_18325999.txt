 beta 1-3-Adrenoreceptor (AR)-deficient mice unable regulate energy expenditure develop diet-induced obesity high-fat diet. determined previously beta2-AR agonist treatment activated expression mRNA encoding orphan nuclear receptor, NOR-1, muscle cells plantaris muscle. show beta2-AR agonist treatment significantly transiently activated expression NOR-1 (and members NR4A subgroup) slow-twitch oxidative soleus muscle fast-twitch glycolytic tibialis anterior muscle. activation induced beta-adrenergic signaling consistent involvement protein kinase A, MAPK, phosphorylation cAMP response element-binding protein. Stable cell lines transfected silent interfering RNA targeting NOR-1 displayed decreased palmitate oxidation lactate accumulation. concordance observations, ATP production NOR-1 silent interfering RNA (but control)-transfected cells resistant (azide-mediated) inhibition oxidative metabolism expressed significantly higher levels hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha. addition, observed repression genes promote fatty acid oxidation (peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha/beta lipin-1alpha) trichloroacetic acid cycle-mediated carbohydrate (pyruvate) oxidation [pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 regulatory catalytic subunits (pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases-1r -c)]. Furthermore, observed beta2-AR agonist administration mouse skeletal muscle induced expression genes activate fatty acid oxidation modulate pyruvate use, including PGC-1alpha, lipin-1alpha, FOXO1, PDK4. Finally, demonstrate NOR-1 recruited lipin-1alpha PDK-4 promoters, consistent NOR-1-mediated regulation genes. conclusion, NOR-1 necessary oxidative metabolism skeletal muscle.
