 X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy neurometabolic disorder caused inactivation peroxisomal ABCD1 transporter long-chain fatty acids. mice, ABCD1 loss causes late onset axonal degeneration spinal cord association locomotor disability resembling common phenotype patients, adrenomyeloneuropathy. Increasing evidence indicates oxidative stress bioenergetic failure play major roles pathogenesis X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. study, aimed evaluate whether mitochondrial biogenesis affected X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. demonstrated Abcd1 null mice show reduced mitochondrial DNA concomitant downregulation mitochondrial biogenesis pathway driven PGC-1alpha/PPARgamma reduced expression mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c, NDUFB8 VDAC. Moreover, show oral administration pioglitazone, agonist PPARgamma, restored mitochondrial content expression master regulators biogenesis, neutralized oxidative damage proteins DNA, reversed bioenergetic failure terms ATP levels, NAD+/NADH ratios, pyruvate kinase glutathione reductase activities. importantly, treatment halted locomotor disability axonal damage X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy mice. results lend support use pioglitazone clinical trials patients adrenomyeloneuropathy reveal novel molecular mechanisms action pioglitazone neurodegeneration. Future studies address effects anti-diabetic drug axonopathies oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction contributing factors.
