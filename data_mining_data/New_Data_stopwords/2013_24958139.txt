 Cancer devastating disease alters metabolism cell surrounding milieu. Metabolomics growing powerful technology capable detecting hundreds thousands metabolites tissues biofluids. recent advances metabolomics technologies enabled deeper investigation metabolism cancer better understanding cancer cells use glycolysis, known "Warburg effect," advantageously produce amino acids, nucleotides lipids necessary tumor proliferation vascularization. Currently, metabolomics research used discover diagnostic cancer biomarkers clinic, better understand complex heterogeneous nature, discover pathways involved cancer could used new targets monitor metabolic biomarkers therapeutic intervention. metabolomics approaches may also provide clues personalized cancer treatments providing useful information clinician cancer patient's response medical interventions.
