 new approach regeneration adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cell-free protein synthesis developed prolong synthesis also avoid accumulation inorganic phosphate. approach demonstrated batch system derived Escherichia coli. Contrary conventional methods exogenous energy sources contain high-energy phosphate bonds, new system designed generate continuously required high-energy phosphate bonds within reaction mixture, thereby recycling phosphate released protein synthesis. allowed accumulate, phosphate inhibits protein synthesis, likely reducing concentration free magnesium ion. Pediococcus sp. pyruvate oxidase, introduced reaction mixture along thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), catalyzed generation acetyl phosphate pyruvate inorganic phosphate. Acetyl kinase, already present sufficient activity Escherichia coli S30 extract, catalyzed regeneration ATP. Oxygen required generation acetyl phosphate H(2)O(2) produced byproduct sufficiently degraded endogenous catalase activity. continuous supply chemical energy, also prevention inorganic phosphate accumulation, duration protein synthesis extended 2 h. Protein accumulation levels also increase. synthesis human lymphotoxin receives greater benefit chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, former sensitive phosphate inhibition. Finally, repeated addition pyruvate amino acids reaction period, protein synthesis continued 6 h new system, resulting final yield 0.7 mg/mL.
