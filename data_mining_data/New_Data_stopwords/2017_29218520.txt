 Warburg effect describes cancer cells exhibit higher-than-normal glucose consumption, hypoxic conditions, also normal oxygen levels present. Although glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) found play key role cellular uptake glucose, especially cancer cells, generally overexpressed, given consideration suitable target development anticancer drugs. chapter, example molecular design realization novel GLUT1 inhibitors, including silico modeling, chemical synthesis, biological characterization, provided. process started identification focused series oxime derivatives, originally designed estrogen receptor (ER) ligands, structurally optimized order direct activity towards GLUT1 minimize binding ERs, leading production efficient selective inhibitors glucose uptake cancer cells.
