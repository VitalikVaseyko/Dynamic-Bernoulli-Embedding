 effect diet desaturation linoleic acid gamma-linolenic acid liver microsomal preparations, blood glucose insulin levels, activities glucokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase studied. female rats used experiments maintained one following dietary regimes: (a) fasted, (b) fasted 96 hr refed glucose, (c) balanced diet, (d) carbohydrate-free diet, (e) lipid-free diet, (f) protein-free diet. Fasting 96 hr caused decrease linoleic acid desaturation glucokinase pyruvate kinase activity together slight decrease blood insulin level. Alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity modified. Refeeding glucose 50 hr increased conversion linoleic acid linolenic acid well activities enzymes studied except alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. increase desaturation, however, transient. feeding lipid-free diet modify tested parameters. Feeding carbohydrate-free diet 96 hr resulted increased linoleic acid desaturation decreased glucokinase pyruvate kinase activity, thus apparently eliminating putative correlation fatty acid desaturating activity glycolytic activity blood insulin levels experimental conditions. findings suggest dietary proteins may play important role determining level fatty acid desaturation.
