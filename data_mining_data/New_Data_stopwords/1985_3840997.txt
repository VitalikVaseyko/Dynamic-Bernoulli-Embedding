 pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) acetyltransferase (E2) components pig heart ox kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex separated purified. E1 component phosphorylated (alpha-chain) inactivated MgATP. Phosphorylation mainly confined site 1. Addition E2 accelerated phosphorylation three sites E1 alpha inactivation E1. basis histone H1 phosphorylation, E2 presumed contain PDH kinase, removed (greater 98%) treatment p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulphonate. Stimulation ATP-dependent inactivation E1 E2 independent histone H1 kinase activity E2. effect E2 attributed conformational change(s) induced E1 and/or E1-associated PDH kinase. PDH kinase activity associated E1 could separated gel filtration DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Subunits PDH kinase detected sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gels E1 E2, presumably low concentration. activity pig heart PDH complex increased E2, E1, indicating E2 rate-limiting holocomplex reaction. ATP-dependent inactivation PDH complex accelerated E1 phosphorylated E1 plus associated PDH kinase, E2 plus presumed PDH kinase. suggested substantial proportion PDH kinase may accompany E1 PDH complex dissociated component enzymes. possibility E1 may possess intrinsic PDH kinase activity considered unlikely, may fully excluded.
