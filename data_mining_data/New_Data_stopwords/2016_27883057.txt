 tumor form pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation gives rise Warburg effect. Warburg effect defines pro-oncogenic metabolism switch cancer cells take glucose normal tissue favor incomplete oxidation glucose, even presence oxygen. Retinal photoreceptors highly metabolic energy consumption equivalent multiplying tumor cell. present study, found PKM2 predominant isoform rod- cone-dominant retina, undergoes light-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. also discovered PKM2 phosphorylation signaled photobleaching rhodopsin. findings suggest phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation promotes PKM2 phosphorylation. Light tyrosine phosphorylation appear regulate PKM2 provide metabolic advantage photoreceptor cells, thereby promoting cell survival.
