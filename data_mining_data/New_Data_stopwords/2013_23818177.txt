 BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation promotes prostate cancer formation progression. Furthermore, alterations energy metabolism hallmark prostate cancer cells. However, actions inflammatory factors energy metabolism prostate epithelial cells previously investigated. first study report effect inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) glycolytic oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial function widely used prostate epithelial cells. METHODS: Pre-malignant RWPE-1 cancerous LNCaP PC-3 cells treated low-dose TNFalpha. Glycolytic oxidative metabolism quantified measuring extracellular acidification oxygen consumption rates, respectively. ATP content lactate export measured luminescence fluorescence, respectively. Mitochondrial content expression glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha), Cytochrome C measured flow cytometry. RESULTS: data suggest TNFalpha increases glycolysis, ATP production, lactate export, reduces oxidative metabolism mitochondrial function prostate epithelial cells. highly aggressive PC-3 cells tend less responsive actions TNFalpha pre-malignant RWPE-1 non-aggressive LNCaP cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular energetics, is, glycolytic oxidative metabolism significantly influenced low-level inflammation prostate epithelial cells. widely used prostate epithelial cell models, micro-environmental inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha induces aerobic glycolysis inhibiting oxidative metabolism. supports hypothesis low-level inflammation induce Warburg metabolism prostate epithelial cells, may promote cancer formation progression.
