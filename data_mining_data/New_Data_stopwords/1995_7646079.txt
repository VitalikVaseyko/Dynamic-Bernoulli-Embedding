 method assessing rates futile cycle presented, illustrated vitro. Glycolytic- gluconeogenic-type futile cycles simulated reactions catalyzed phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) assays systems cycle rates either direction varied determined. either system sustaining net flux carbons given direction, flux radioactively labeled carbons opposite direction determined. Different cycle rates obtained varying phosphofructokinase activity keeping fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity constant "gluconeogenic" simulation varying fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase keeping phosphofructokinase activity constant "glycolytic" simulation. direct, linear relationship found cycle rate radioactive labeling fructose 1,6-bisphosphate [U-14C]glucose 6-phosphate net gluconeogenic carbon flux. Also, direct, linear relationship found cycle rate radioactive labeling fructose-6-P [U-14C]fructose-1,6-bisP net glycolytic carbon flux. applicability, advantages, problems method discussed.
