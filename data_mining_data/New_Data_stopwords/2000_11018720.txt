 produce high amounts extracellular endo-beta-1,6-glucanase, overexpressed gene bgn16.2 Trichoderma harzianum control pyruvate kinase gene promoter (pki) T. reesei. Transcription bgn16.2 gene increased conditions extracellular beta-1,6-glucanase levels. Relationship extracellular BGN16.2 protein presence proteases studied order maximize production. changing carbon nitrogen sources buffering culture media different pHs, four major proteases, acidic ones pH-regulated, detected. Overexpression BGN16.2 low pH resulted BGN16.2 degradation, due induction aspartyl proteases instability pH 3. Maximal overproduction BGN16.2 albeit pure achieved buffered medium, pH-induced aspartyl proteases absent nitrogen sources, yeast extract, peptone casein substrate proteases.
