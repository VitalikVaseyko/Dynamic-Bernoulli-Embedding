 Perfused rat hearts show markedly increased binding phosphofructokinase fructose-bisphosphate aldolase consequence ischaemia, little change binding pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 10 min ischaemia one quarter phosphofructokinase three quarters aldolase bound. effect anoxia less well marked influence binding aldolase showing significant increase binding. results suggest one factor involved increased binding ischaemia fall pH heart. Binding studies isolated myofibrils confirm affinity stoichiometry aldolase binding considerably increased pH lowered range comparable occurs ischaemic heart. low level binding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase perfused rat hearts correlates relatively low affinity enzyme binding rat rabbit cardiac myofibrils. species differences enzyme binding response ischaemia. Sheep hearts show rapid large increases binding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase addition changes aldolase phosphofructokinase binding. greater binding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reflects greater affinity sheep cardiac myofibrils. suggested altered metabolic demands ischaemia satisfied changes glycolytic enzyme organisation enzymes shift soluble particulate phase cardiac muscle.
