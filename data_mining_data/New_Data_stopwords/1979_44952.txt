 1) rate 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate breakdown independent pH value. 2) adenine nucleotide pattern alkaline pH values characteristic lowering ATP accompanying accumulation fructose-1,6-bisphosphate caused relative excess activity hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system compared wity pyruvate kinase. 3) breakdown adenine nucleotides proceeds via AMP mainly phosphatase via AMP deaminase. 4) constancy sum nucleotides long glucose present postulated due resynthesis via adenosine kinase competes successfully adenosine deaminase. 5) procedure given calculate ATPase activity glucose-depleted red cells. results indicate ATPase activity less lower pH values declines time. ATPase high Km ATP postulated. 6) glucose depletion ATP production mostly derived breakdown 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate supply pentose phosphate pool proceed constant rate. contribution pentose phosphate breakdown adenine nucleotides amounts 40% lactate formed pH 6.8 twice lactate pH 8.1.
