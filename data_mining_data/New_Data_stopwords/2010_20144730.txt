 investigate primary effects pyruvate kinase (PYK) defect glucose metabolism Corynebacterium glutamicum, pyk-deleted mutant derived wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC13032 using double-crossover chromosome replacement technique. mutant evaluated glutamic acid-producing conditions induced biotin limitation. mutant showed increased specific rate glucose consumption, decreased growth, higher glutamic acid production, aspartic acid formation glutamic acid production phase. significant increase phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase activity significant decrease PEP carboxykinase activity occurred mutant, suggested enhanced overall flux anaplerotic pathway PEP oxaloacetic acid mutant. enhanced anaplerotic flux may explain increased rate glucose consumption higher productivity glutamic acid mutant. Since pyk-complemented strain similar metabolic profiles wild-type strain, observed changes represented intrinsic effects pyk deletion physiology C. glutamicum.
