 Cytokines induce cell proliferation growth suppression depending context. increasingly becoming clear success standard radiotherapy and/or chemotherapeutics eradicate solid tumors dependent IFN signaling. review discuss molecular mechanisms tumor growth suppression gene product isolated laboratory using genome-wide expression knock-down strategy. Gene associated retinoid-IFN-induced mortality -19 (GRIM-19) functions non-canonical tumor suppressor antagonizing oncoproteins. component mitochondrial respiratory chain, GRIM-19 influences degree "Warburg effect" cancer cells many advanced and/or aggressive tumors show severely down-regulated GRIM-19 levels. addition, GRIM-19 appears regulate innate acquired immune responses mouse models. Thus, GRIM-19 positioned nodes favor cell protection and/or prevent aberrant cell growth.
