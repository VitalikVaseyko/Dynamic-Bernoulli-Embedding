 Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) new transcription factor binds carbohydrate-responsive element l-type pyruvate kinase gene (l-PK). aim study investigate mechanism feeding high fat diets results decreased activity ChREBP liver (Yamashita, H., Takenoshita, M., Sakurai, M., Bruick, R. K., Henzel, W. J., Shillinglaw, W., Arnot, D., Uyeda, K. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 9116-9121). cloned rat liver ChREBP gene use throughout study. Acetate, octanoate, palmitate inhibited glucose-induced activation l-PK transcription ChREBP-overexpressed hepatocytes. hepatocytes, cytosolic AMP concentration increased 30-fold AMP-activated protein kinase activity activated 2-fold. Similarly fatty acids, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide, specific activator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also inhibited l-PK transcription activity ChREBP-overexpressed hepatocytes. Using substrate truncated ChREBP consisting C-terminal region, demonstrated phosphorylation AMPK resulted inactivation DNA binding activity. AMPK specifically phosphorylated Ser(568) ChREBP. S568A mutant ChREBP gene showed tight DNA binding lost fatty acid sensitivity, whereas S568D mutant showed weak DNA binding inhibited l-PK transcription activity even absence fatty acid. results strongly suggested fatty acid inhibition glucose-induced l-PK transcription resulted AMPK phosphorylation ChREBP Ser(568), inactivated DNA binding activity. AMPK activated increased AMP generated fatty acid activation.
