 BACKGROUND/AIMS: M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) enzyme produced undifferentiated proliferating tissues. study aims evaluate usefulness immunochromatographic M2 pyruvate kinase (iM2-PK) screening colorectal cancer (CRC) premalignant lesions. METHODS: Healthy volunteers patients colorectal neoplasia enrolled six academic hospitals capital province Korea. iM2-PK value compared immunochromatographic fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) fecal tumor M2-PK enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: total 323 subjects enrolled. sensitivity iM2-PK CRC 92.8%, superior iFOBT (47.5%, p<0.0001). adenomatous lesions, sensitivity iM2-PK 69.4%, also superior iFOBT (12.1%, p<0.001). Compared M2-PK ELISA, iM2-PK exhibited significantly enhanced sensitivity CRC (97.5% vs 80.0%, p=0.0289). sensitivity iM2-PK higher advanced stages CRC compared cancers confined mucosa submucosa (p<0.05). However, lymph node metastasis influence sensitivity iM2-PK. CONCLUSIONS: iM2-PK exhibited increased sensitivity identifying CRC adenomatous lesions compared iFOBT. Given rapid results convenience, CRC screening using iM2-PK promising.
