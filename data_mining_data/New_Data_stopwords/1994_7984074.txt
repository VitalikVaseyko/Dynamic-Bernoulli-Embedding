 isotopically substituted molecule (6-13C, 1, 6, 6-2H3)glucose evaluated determine whether metabolic 2H loss would prevent use quantitating pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity. PPP activity causes C1 glucose lost CO2, C6 appear lactate. 2H NMR analysis lactate produced glucose distinguish (3-2H)-lactate (from C1 glucose) (3-13C, 3, 3-2H2)lactate (from C6 glucose). 2H NMR spectroscopic analysis medium containing (6-13C, 1, 6, 6-2H3)glucose incubation cultured rat 9L glioma cells suggested 30.8 +/- 2.1% PPP activity compared 6.0 +/- 0.8% separate, parallel incubations (1-13C)glucose (6-13C)glucose. Subsequent experiments isotopically labeled glucose molecules suggest discrepancy due selective loss 2H C1 position glucose, catalyzed phosphomannose isomerase. Failure consider 2H exchange C1 C6 positions glucose lead incorrect conclusions metabolic studies utilizing deuterated tritiated glucose molecules.
