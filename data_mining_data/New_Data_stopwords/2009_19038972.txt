 AIMS: Inflammatory responses heart driven sustained increases cytokines associated several pathological processes, including cardiac hypertrophy heart failure. Emerging data suggest link cardiomyopathy myocardial metabolism dysregulation. elucidate relationship pro-inflammatory profile cardiac metabolism dysregulation, human cell line cardiac origin, AC16, treated tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). METHODS RESULTS: Exposure AC16 cells TNF-alpha inhibited expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), upstream regulator lipid glucose oxidative metabolism. Studies performed cardiac-specific transgenic mice (Mus musculus) overexpressing TNF-alpha, well characterized model cytokine-induced cardiomyopathy, also displayed reduced PGC-1alpha expression heart compared control mice. mechanism TNF-alpha reduced PGC-1alpha expression vitro appeared largely mediated via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. PGC-1alpha downregulation resulted increase glucose oxidation rate, involved reduction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression depended DNA-binding activity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta estrogen-related receptor alpha transcription factors. CONCLUSION: results point PGC-1alpha downregulation potential contributor cardiac dysfunction heart failure metabolic disorders inflammatory background.
