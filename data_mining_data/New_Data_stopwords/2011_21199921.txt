 Tafenoquine (TFQ), 8-aminoquinoline used treat prevent Plasmodium infections, could represent alternative therapy leishmaniasis. Indeed, TFQ shown significant leishmanicidal activity vitro vivo, targets Leishmania mitochondria activates final apoptosis-like process. order jeopardize life span potential antileishmania drug, important determine likelihood Leishmania develop resistance TFQ mechanisms resistance induced. address issue, TFQ-resistant Leishmania major promastigote line (R4) selected. resistance, unstable drug-free medium (revertant line), maintained intramacrophage amastigote forms, R4 promastigotes found cross-resistant 8-aminoquinolines. decreased TFQ uptake, probably associated alkalinization intracellular pH rather drug efflux, observed R4 revertant lines. TFQ induces decrease ATP synthesis Leishmania lines, although total ATP levels maintained higher values R4 parasites. contrast, ATP synthesis glycolysis significantly increased R4 parasites, whereas mitochondrial ATP synthesis similar wild-type parasites. therefore conclude increased glycolytic ATP synthesis main mechanism underlying TFQ resistance Leishmania.
