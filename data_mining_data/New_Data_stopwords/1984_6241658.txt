 effects Cu2+ glycolysis several glycolytic enzymes studied rat brain extracts vitro. concentrations reportedly found Wilson's disease, Cu2+ significantly inhibited lactate production glucose glucose-6-phosphate rat brain postnuclear supernatant IC50 3 microM. Cu2+ also inhibited several glycolytic enzymes. Amongst latter, Cu2+ effective inhibiting hexokinase (IC50 Cu2+ = 7 microM), moderately effective inhibiting pyruvate kinase (IC50 Cu2+ = 56 microM), least effective inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase (IC50 Cu2+ = 300 microM). results suggest inhibition brain glycolysis may pathophysiological importance copper poisoning Wilson's disease.
