 Diabetes increases incidence cardiovascular disease well complications myocardial infarction. Studies using animal models diabetes demonstrated metabolic alterations occurring myocyte level may contribute severity ischemic injury diabetic hearts. several mechanisms investigated understand pathogenesis diabetic complications, increased metabolism glucose via polyol pathway received considerable attention. Deviant metabolic regulation due increased flux aldose reductase diabetic hearts may influence ability myocardium withstand ischemia insult. determine aldose reductase inhibition improves tolerance ischemia, hearts acute type diabetic nondiabetic control rats isolated retrograde perfused. group exposed 1 micromol/l zopolrestat, specific inhibitor aldose reductase, 10 min, followed 20 min global ischemia 60 min reperfusion absence zopolrestat. Zopolrestat reduced sorbitol levels ischemia diabetic hearts. cytosolic redox state (NADH/NAD+), measured lactate-to-pyruvate ratios, significantly lowered baseline, ischemic, reperfusion conditions diabetic hearts perfused zopolrestat. diabetic hearts, ATP significantly higher zopolrestat hearts ischemia, phosphocreatine left ventricular-developed pressure reperfusion. Zopolrestat provided similar metabolic functional benefits nondiabetic hearts. Creatine kinase release reduced approximately 50% nondiabetic diabetic hearts treated zopolrestat. data indicate inhibition aldose reductase activity preserves high-energy phosphates, maintains lower cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, markedly protects diabetic nondiabetic hearts ischemia reperfusion.
