 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex isolated 'anaerobic' mitochondria Ascaris suum subunit composition similar complexes isolated eukaryotic organisms regulated phosphorylation dephosphorylation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity stimulated NADH number physiologically important acyl-CoA intermediates inhibited CoA, propionate, tiglate pyruvate. suggested elevated levels pyruvate observed ascarid organelle may important maintaining pyruvate dehydrogenase complex active state, even presence reduced pyridine nucleotide pool.
