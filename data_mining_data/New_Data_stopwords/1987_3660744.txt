 Content hexokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase studied rat callus, formed presence commercially available preparations placental normal serum albumin. Total activity enzymes similar different stages healing; enzymatic activity closely related morpho-functional state cellular structures repairing zone dependent maturation. Especially pronounced changes glycolytic enzymes activity occurred period maximal proliferative activity osteogenic cells. Placental albumin shown exhibit greater stimulating effect reparative osteogenesis compared protein blood serum.
