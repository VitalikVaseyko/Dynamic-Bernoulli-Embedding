 Mitogenic prosurvival effects underlie tumorigenic roles prolactin (PRL) pathogenesis breast cancer. PRL signaling mediated receptor (PRLr). proteomics screen identified pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), glycolytic enzyme known play important role tumorigenesis, protein constitutively interacts PRLr. Treatment cells PRL inhibited pyruvate kinase activity increased lactate content human cells manner dependent abundance PRLr, activation Janus kinase 2, tyrosine phosphorylation intracellular domain PRLr. Knockdown PKM2 attenuated PRL-stimulated cell proliferation. extent proliferation rescued knock-in wild-type PKM2 mutant insensitive PRL-mediated inhibition. discuss hypothesis inhibition PKM2 PRL contributes PRL-stimulated cell proliferation.
