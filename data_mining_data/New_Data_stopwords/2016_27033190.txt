 Phytometabolites functional elements derived plants exhibit therapeutic characteristics anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant effects. Phytometabolites exert anti-cancer effect targeting multiple signaling pathways. One remarkable phenomena targeted phytometabolites Warburg effect. Warburg effect describes observation cancer cells exhibit increased rate glycolysis aberrant redox activity compared normal cells. phenomenon promotes cancer development progression. Recent observations revealed phytometabolites could target metabolic-related enzymes (e.g. Hexokinase, Pyruvate kinase M2, HIF-1) cancer cells, little harm normal cells. Since hyper-proliferation cancer cells fueled higher cellular metabolism, phytometabolites targeting metabolic pathways create synergistic crosstalk induced apoptotic pathways sensitize cancer cells chemotherapeutic agents. review, discuss phytometabolites target Warburg effect underlying molecular mechanism leads tumor growth suppression.
