 antitumor effects Indo-3-carbinol (I3C) proven many human carcinoma cells. However, roles 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM), important polymer converted I3C pH 5.0-7.0, growth proliferation cervical cancer HeLa SiHa cells still remain unrevealed. present study, investigated potential anti-proliferative pro-apoptotic effects DIM HeLa SiHa cells. Cell proliferation detected Cell Counting kit-8 apoptosis analyzed flow cytometry. addition, morphological changes accompanying cell apoptosis observed using inverted microscope Hoechst 33258 staining. addition, expression changes proteins involved MAPK PI3K pathways determined western blotting. DIM treatment inhibited proliferation induced apoptosis HeLa SiHa cells significantly time- dose-dependent manner. Moreover, SiHa cells sensitive DIM treatment HeLa cells (P<0.05). addition, expression ERK, p38 p-p38, involved MAPK pathway, downregulated DIM treatment. Another protein involved MAPK pathway, JNK, upregulated. Furthermore, DIM treatment significantly suppressed expression Akt, p-Akt, PI3K p110alpha, PI3K p110beta, PI3K class III, GSK3-beta, p-PDK1 p-c-Raf involved PI3K pathway. results demonstrate DIM exerts antitumor effects HeLa SiHa cells anti-proliferative pro-apoptotic roles, especially SiHa cells. molecular mechanism effects may related regulatory effects MAPK PI3K pathway apoptosis proteins. DIM may preventive therapeutic agent cervical cancer.
