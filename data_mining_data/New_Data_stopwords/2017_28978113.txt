 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) verified correlate prognosis many types cancer. However, role development metastasis tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unclear. immunohistochemistry (IHC) results confirmed PKM2 overexpressed patients TSCC. PKM2 up-regulation related lymph node metastasis associated reduced overall survival. According microarray analysis Western blots, PKM2 expression up-regulated TSCC cells enhanced metastatic potential. PKM2 knockdown inhibited cell migration invasion, reduced SOD2 (manganese superoxide dismutase) activity intracellular H2O2 level, inhibited tumour growth lung metastasis vivo. PKM2 overexpression promoted cell migration invasion, increased SOD2 activity intracellular H2O2 level. Moreover, miR-138 directly targeted PKM2 inhibited PKM2 expression. Thus, PKM2 deregulation plays important role TSCC may serve biomarker metastatic potential therapeutic target patients TSCC. PKM2, miR-138 target gene, enhances metastatic potential TSCC SOD2-H2O2 pathway.
