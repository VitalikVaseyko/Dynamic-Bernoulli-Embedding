 sensitive rapid situ immunoassay quantitatively determine cellular antigens intact cells developed. Antigens located plasma membrane, endosome, cytosol, lysosome endoplasmic reticulum cultured cells fixed situ reacted monoclonal antibodies permeabilization cells saponin. antigen-antibody complexes quantified colorimetric method peroxidase-substrate reaction. Epidermal growth factor receptor, monomer pyruvate kinase M2 endoplasmic reticulum-associated thyroid hormone-binding protein easily detected 0.5-1 x 10(4) cells method. Antibody low 10 ng/ml gave reproducible results. Using method, vivo dynamic interconversion monomer-tetramer pyruvate kinase M2 found regulated glucose. ligand-induced epidermal growth factor receptor different subcellular compartments endocytosis easily quantified method. method also used compare different amounts endoplasmic reticulum-associated thyroid hormone-binding protein various cultured cells. Thus, situ immunoassay easy versatile method used study various cellular antigens involvement cellular processes.
