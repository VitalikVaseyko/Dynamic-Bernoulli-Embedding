 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) catalyzes conversion pyruvate acetyl-coenzyme A, enters Krebs cycle, providing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cell. PDH activity control pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs). hypoxic conditions, conversion pyruvate lactate occurs, reaction catalyzed lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5). cancer cells, however pyruvate transformed lactate occurs, regardless presence oxygen (aerobic glycolysis/Warburg effect). Although, hypoxic intratumoral conditions account HIF1alpha stabilization induction anaerobic metabolism, recent data suggest high pyruvate concentrations also result HIF1alpha stabilization independently hypoxia. present immunohistochemical study, provide evidence PDH/PDK pathway repressed 73% non small cell lung carcinomas, may key reason HIF1alpha stabilization "aerobic glycolysis." However, half PDH-HIF pathway, patients harboring tumors excellent postoperative outcome. small subgroup clinically aggressive tumors maintains coherent PDH HIF/LDH5 expression. contrast cancer cells, fibroblasts tumor supporting stroma exhibit intense PDH reduced PDK1 expression favoring maximum PDH activity. means stroma may use lactic acid produced tumor cells, preventing creation intolerable intratumoral acidic environment time.
