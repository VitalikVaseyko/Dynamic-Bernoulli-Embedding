 Plasma glucose lactate concentrations glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), glutamate-oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), aldolase (ALD), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD) activities determined before, throughout incubation period, course viral-induced diarrhea neonatal calf. Hypoglycemia glucose concentration less 40 mg/dl plasma observed 3 10 calves. Plasma lactate concentration increased 1.84 plus minus 0.1 times normal 7 6 7 times normal 2 animals. major change glucose lactate concentrations diarrhea occurred 24 hours preceding death. Changes SGPT, SGOT, AP activities observed, indicating absence marked hepatic damage. ALD, CPK, HBD activities increased 2 calves CPK alone increased 2 others, indicating cardiac possibly skeletal muscle damage.
