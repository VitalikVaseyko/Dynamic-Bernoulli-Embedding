 Banana extensively cultivated plant worldwide, mainly fruit, ancillary product, banana flower consumed vegetable highly recommended diabetics traditional Indian medicine system. study based investigation vivo antihyperglycaemic activity Umbelliferone (C1) Lupeol (C2) isolated ethanol extract banana flower (EF) alloxan induced diabetic rat model. Diabetic rats administered C1, C2 EF (100 200 mg/kg b. wt.) 4 weeks showed deterioration fasting hyperglycaemia reversal abnormalities serum/urine protein, urea creatinine, compared diabetic control group rats. diabetic group rats fed EF, C1 C2 (100 mg/kg b. wt.) daily, period 28 days resulted significant reduction diabetic symptoms viz., polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria urine sugar together improved body weight. HbA1c extent reduced whereas levels insulin Hb increased. extract compounds wielded positive impacts diabetic rats reversal altered activities hepatic marker enzymes viz., aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP); glycolytic enzyme (hexokinase); shunt enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase); gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase) pyruvate kinase. characteristic diabetic complications hypercholesterolemia hypertriacylglycerolemia also significantly reverted normal serum/liver diabetic rats. Besides these, treatment increased activities enzymatic non-enzymatic antioxidants serum liver. histological observations revealed marked regeneration beta-cells drug treated diabetic rats. conclusion, present study illustrates EF, C1 C2 enhances glycolytic activities, besides increasing hepatic glucose utilization diabetic rats stimulating insulin secretion remnant beta-cells along potential enzymatic non-enzymatic antioxidant activities.
