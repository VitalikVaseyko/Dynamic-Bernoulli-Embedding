 Pyruvate kinase plays crucial role glycolytic pathway, main route provides energy brain functioning. present study, investigated kinetics inhibition pyruvate kinase provoked phenylalanine main metabolite, phenylpyruvate, mitochondria-free cerebral cortex homogenate 22-day-old Wistar rats. found phenylalanine phenylpyruvate inhibit PK activity competition enzyme substrates ADP phosphoenolpyruvate. also investigated interaction phenylalanine phenylpyruvate, kinetics alanine prevention inhibitory action phenylalanine phenylpyruvate pyruvate kinase activity. observed alanine per se effect PK activity prevented inhibitory action phenylalanine phenylpyruvate competition. data suggest phenylalanine, phenylpyruvate, alanine act common site enzyme, probably allosteric one. possible inhibition brain PK activity may related reduction glucose metabolism observed brain phenylketonuric patients may one mechanisms responsible neurological dysfunction found patients. studies, however, necessary evaluate benefit carbohydrate alanine supplementation diet phenylketonuric patients.
