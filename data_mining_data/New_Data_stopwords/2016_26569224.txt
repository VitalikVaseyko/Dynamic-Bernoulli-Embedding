 identification arsenic direct-binding proteins essential determining mechanism arsenic trioxide achieves chemotherapeutic effects. least two cysteines close together amino acid sequence crucial binding arsenic essential identification arsenic-binding proteins. present study, arsenic binding proteins pulled streptavidin identified using liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). 40 arsenic-binding proteins separated, redox-related proteins, glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), heat shock 70 kDa protein 9 (HSPA9) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), studied using binding assays vitro. Notably, PKM2 high affinity arsenic. contrast PKM2, GSTP1and HSPA9 combine arsenic directly vitro. observations suggest arsenic-mediated acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) suppressive effects involve PKM2. summary, identified several arsenic binding proteins APL cells investigated therapeutic mechanisms arsenic trioxide APL. investigation specific signal pathways PKM2 mediates APL developments may lead better understanding arsenic effects APL.
