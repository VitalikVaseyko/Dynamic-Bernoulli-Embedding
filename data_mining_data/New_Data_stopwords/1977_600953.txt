 Five dialysis and/or adsorbent therapy programmes compared examine biological toxicity small middle molecular fractions clinical viewpoint. combination various surface areas, diffusion pool sizes, use charcoal, called 'molecular prescription' possible. programmes designed bring different degrees removal fractions. Ultrafiltrates obtained Amicon XM-10 hollow fibre filters programme examined levels BUN, creatinine, methylguanidine, inhibitory effect pyruvate kinase, G-6-PDH, LDH, cell mortality rate rat embryo liver cell monolayer culture. worst results obtained programmes retained small molecular fractions removed middle molecular fractions efficiently. biological toxicity small molecular fraction, viewpoint maintaining 'milieu interieur', seems much stronger middle molecular fraction. dialysis adsorbent therapy programme removing middle molecular fraction only, leaving small molecular fraction considered putting cart horse.
