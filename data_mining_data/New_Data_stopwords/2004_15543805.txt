 Energy metabolism affected hypoxia-ischemia. Changes tissue concentrations high-energy phosphate reserves occur early course metabolic insult concurrent increases cellular ADP AMP leading glycolysis. shown enzymes glycolysis tend regulated hypoxia ischemia. study determined pyruvate kinase (PK) activity, one main enzymes glycolysis, brain tissues healthy (n = 15) hypoxic-ischemic (n = 18) 7-day-old newborn rats. Left common carotid artery ligated hypoxic-ischemic group 2 hours rats exposed hypoxia chamber 34-36 degrees C 8% oxygen nitrogen. rats decapitated 2 hours hypoxia right left cerebral hemispheres (CH) cerebellum-brain stem (C-BS) removed. Pyruvate kinase activity significantly higher C-BSs CHs groups (p < 0.00005). significant difference enzyme activities either CHs C-BS hypoxic-ischemic group compared control healthy group (p > 0.05). conclusion, brain pyruvate kinase activity change hypoxia-ischemia suggests PK brain differs tissues usually increases hypoxiaischemia.
