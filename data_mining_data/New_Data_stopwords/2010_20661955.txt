 Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues primary preferred medium archiving patients' samples. demonstrate relative quantifications protein biomarkers extracts laser microdissected epithelial cells FFPE endometrial carcinoma tissues versus normal proliferative endometria means targeted proteomic analyses using LC-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) MS MRM Tags Relative Absolute Quantitation (mTRAQ) labeling. Comparable results differential expressions pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PK-M2) polymeric Ig receptor observed analyses laser microdissected epithelial cells FFPE tissues corresponding homogenates frozen tissues individuals previously analyzed reported. also identified PK-M2 normal proliferative phase endometrium. biomarkers addition PK-M2 polymeric Ig receptor also observed consistently and/or levels threshold quantification.
