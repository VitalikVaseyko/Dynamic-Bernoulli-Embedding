 accumulating evidence omega-3 fatty acids may modulate immune responses. monocytes differentiated dendritic cells (DCs) presence docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), expression costimulatory antigen presentation markers altered concentration-dependent way, positively negatively, depending markers tested maturation stage DCs. Changes induced eicosapentaenoic acid linoleic acid similar less intense DHA, whereas oleic acid almost effect. DHA-treated, mature DCs showed inhibition IL-6 expression IL-10 IL-12 secretion, lymphoproliferative stimulation capacity impaired. phenotypic alterations DCs induced DHA similar already reported Rosiglitazone (Rosi), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) activator, retinoid 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA), retinoid X receptor (RXR) activator. Moreover, DHA induced expression PPAR gamma target genes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 aP-2 immature DCs. combination DHA Rosi 9cRA produced additive effects. Furthermore, DCs cultured presence specific PPAR gamma inhibitor, changes induced DHA blocked. Together, results strongly suggest PPAR gamma:RXR heterodimer pathway component activated DHA induce immunomodulatory effect DCs.
