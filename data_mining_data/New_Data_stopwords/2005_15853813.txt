 Lactococcus lactis enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) uniquely encoded las operon. used metabolic control analysis study role organization. Earlier studies shown that, wild-type levels, LDH control glycolysis growth rate, high negative control formate production (C(Jformate)LDH=-1.3). found PFK PK exert control glycolysis growth rate wild-type enzyme levels enzymes exert strong positive control glycolytic flux reduced activities. PK exerts high positive control formate (C(Jformate)PK=0.9-1.1) acetate production (C(Jacetate)PK=0.8-1.0), whereas PFK exerts control fluxes increased expression. Decreased expression entire las operon resulted strong decrease growth rate glycolytic flux; 53% expression las operon glycolytic flux reduced 44% flux control coefficient increased towards 3. Increased las expression resulted slight decrease glycolytic flux. wild-type levels, control close zero glycolysis pyruvate branches. sum control coefficients three enzymes individually comparable control coefficient found entire operon; strong positive control exerted PK almost cancels negative control exerted LDH formate production. analysis suggests coregulation PFK PK provides efficient way regulate glycolysis, coregulating PK LDH allows cells maintain homolactic fermentation glycolysis regulation.
