 Red cell carbonic anhydrase activity, 2.3 DPG concentration, activities three key enzymes controlling DPG metabolism (PK, PFK DPGM) measured normoxic hypoxic (incubation 13.5% O2) chick embryos. normoxia 2.3 DPG concentration carbonic anhydrase activity begin increase third week incubation. Hypoxia induces rise 2.3 DPG concentration carbonic anhydrase activity Day 8 development, i.e., 1 week earlier. Since normal development chick embryos become hypoxic third week incubation, results suggest PO2 controlling influence timing differentiation events definitive embryonic red cells.
