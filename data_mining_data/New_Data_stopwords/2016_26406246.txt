 Hypoxia induced oxidative stress incurs pathophysiological changes hypertrophied cardiomyocytes promoting translocation p53 mitochondria. Here, investigate cardio-protective efficacy nanocurcumin protecting primary human ventricular cardiomyocytes (HVCM) hypoxia induced damages. Hypoxia induced hypertrophy confirmed FITC-phenylalanine uptake assay, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels cell size measurements. Hypoxia induced translocation p53 investigated using mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore blocker cyclosporin (blocks entry p53 mitochondria) confirmed western blot immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial damage hypertrophied HVCM cells evaluated analysing bio-energetic, anti-oxidant metabolic function substrate switching form lipids glucose. Nanocurcumin prevented translocation p53 mitochondria stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential de-stressed hypertrophied HVCM cells significant restoration lactate, acetyl-coenzyme A, pyruvate glucose content along lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKalpha) activity. Significant restoration glucose modulation GLUT-1 GLUT-4 levels confirmed nanocurcumin mediated prevention substrate switching. Nanocurcumin prevented mitochondrial stress confirmed c-fos/c-jun/p53 signalling. data indicates decrease p-300 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) mediated histone acetylation GATA-4 activation pharmacological targets nanocurcumin preventing hypoxia induced hypertrophy. study provides insight propitious therapeutic effects nanocurcumin cardio-protection usability clinical applications.
