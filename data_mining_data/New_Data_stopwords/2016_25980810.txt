 study designed using 360 21-day-old chicks determine influences diet supplementation glutamine (5 g/kg), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 100 mg/kg) combinations performance serum parameters exposed cycling high temperatures. 22 35 days, experimental groups (2 x 2) subjected circular heat stress exposing 30-34 degrees C cycling, positive control group exposed 23 degrees C constant. blood broilers collected detect serum parameters days 28 35. Compared positive control group, cycling high temperature decreased (p < 0.05) feed consumption, weight gain serum total protein (TP), glucose, thyroxine (T4), insulin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamine, GABA glutamate levels, increased (p < 0.05) serum triglyceride (TG), corticosterone (CS), glucagon (GN), creatine kinase (CK), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels 22-35 days. However, dietary glutamine (5 g/kg) increased (p < 0.05) feed consumption, weight gain serum levels glutamine, TP, insulin ALP, decreased (p < 0.05) serum TG, CK, GOT, NOS GPT levels. Diet supplemented GABA also increased (p < 0.05) weight gain serum levels TP, T4, ALP, GABA glutamine. addition, significant interactions (p < 0.05) glutamine GABA found feed consumption, weight gain serum ALP, CK, LDH, GABA, T3 T4 levels heat-stressed chickens. research indicated dietary glutamine GABA improved antistress ability performance serum parameters broilers hot environment.
