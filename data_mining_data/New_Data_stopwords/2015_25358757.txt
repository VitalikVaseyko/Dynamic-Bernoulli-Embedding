 BACKGROUND: study evaluated impact Vernonia amygdalina (VA) transcription key enzymes involved cellular modulation glucose streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats bid understand possible anti-diabetic mechanism VA. METHODS: chloroform fraction VA (200 mg/kg 400 mg/kg body weight) administered SDRs 7 14 days. Thereafter, expression (transcription) key carbohydrate regulatory genes evaluated selected tissues - adipose, muscle liver. Also, body weight blood glucose changes monitored. RESULTS: 14-day administration 200 mg 400 mg extract metformin (500 mg/kg) showed striking decrease (P <0.05) expression gluconeogenic enzymes - fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase glucose 6-phosphatase liver muscle compared diabetic control. genes highly expressed tissues untreated diabetic rats (P <0.05) indicating severe gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, extract well metformin significantly increased glucose oxidation via pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) i.e. increased expression glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) gene (P <0.05) liver. Conversely, expression G6PDH muscle adipose tissues significantly decreased (P <0.05), suggesting enhanced utilization NADPH ribose clearance reactive oxygen species expression relevant genes respectively. Also, transcription cell proliferation regulatory enzyme, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase increased liver, decreased muscle adipose tissues (P <0.05) upon treatment extract metformin, implying liver responded VA metformin treatments organs. extract administration also caused decrease expression key enzymes glycolysis namely hexokinase phosphofructokinase, suggestive glucose sparing ribose NADPH production PPP. CONCLUSION: Overall, data obtained study suggest VA exerts little effect glycolysis; rather, may achieve anti-diabetic action simultaneous suppression gluconeogenesis potentiation glucose oxidation via PPP pathway, almost exclusively liver.
