 Glucose represents important source energy cells. Proliferating cancer cells consume elevated quantity glucose, converted lactate regardless presence oxygen. phenomenon, known Warburg effect, proven useful imaging metabolically active tumours cancer patients (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Glucose internalised cells glucose transporters (GLUTs) belonging GLUT family. GLUT1 (SLC2A1) prevalent isoform aggressive less differentiated thyroid cancer histotypes. previous work, found loss expression PTEN associated increased expression GLUT1 plasma membrane (PM) probability detecting thyroid incidentalomas FDG-PET. Herein, investigated molecular pathways govern expression GLUT1 PM glucose uptake WRO (expressing WT PTEN) FTC133 (PTEN null) follicular thyroid cancer cells cultured glucose-depleted conditions. membrane expression GLUT1 enhanced glucose-deprived cells. genetic manipulations PTEN expression, could demonstrate lack oncosuppressor dominant effect membrane expression GLUT1 glucose uptake. conclude loss function PTEN increases probability cancer detection FDG-PET glucose-based imaging diagnosis.
