 n-3 fatty acids contribute regulation hepatic fatty acid oxidation synthesis adults accumulate fetal infant liver variable amounts depending maternal diet fat composition. Using 2D gel proteomics matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight mass spectrometry, recently identified altered abundance proteins associated glucose amino acid metabolism neonatal rat liver increased n-3 fatty acids. Here, extend studies n-3 fatty acids hepatic metabolic development targeted gene metabolite analyses map results metabolic pathways consider role n-3 fatty acids glucose, fatty acid, amino metabolism. Feeding rats 1.5% compared <0.1% energy 18:3n-3 gestation led higher 20:5n-3 22:6n-3 3-day-old offspring liver, higher serine hydroxymethyltransferase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, acyl CoA oxidase lower pyruvate kinase stearoyl CoA desaturase gene expression, higher cholesterol, NADPH glutathione, lower glycine (P < 0.05). Integration results suggests n-3 fatty acids may important facilitating hepatic metabolic adaptation utero nutrition postnatal high-fat milk diet, increasing fatty acid oxidation directing glucose amino acids anabolic pathways.
