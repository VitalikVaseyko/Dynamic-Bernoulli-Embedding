 Cyst growth patients autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease thought due increased tubular cell proliferation. One model explain altered proliferation suggests polycystin proteins PC1 PC2 localize apical cilia serve integral part flow-sensing pathway thus modulating proliferative response. measured proliferation apoptosis proximal tubule derived cell lines lacking PC1. cells showed increased rates proliferation, decreased rate apoptosis, compared control heterozygous cell lines, spontaneously formed cysts rather tubules vitro tubulogenesis assay. Addition neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), small secreted protein binds diverse ligands, cells lacking PC1 inhibited proliferation increased apoptosis leading slower cyst growth vitro. Sustained over-expression low level NGAL adenoviral delivery system suppressed cyst enlargement without improving renal function Pkd1 mutant mice. studies show renal epithelial cells lacking PC1 inherent tendency hyper-proliferate forming cysts vitro independent flow stimulus. potential benefit attenuating cyst growth NGAL remains determined.
