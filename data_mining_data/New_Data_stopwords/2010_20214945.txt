 aim present study obtain evidence possible modulatory effect leptin glucosensing capacity hypothalamus hindbrain rainbow trout. first experiment, trout injected ICV saline alone containing increased doses leptin (0.3-30 microg microl(-1)). Leptin induced general hypothalamus hindbrain dose-dependent changes parameters related glucosensing (increased glycogenic glycolytic potentials together increased GK activity, increased mRNA levels genes involved glucosensing response) compatible occurring hyperglycemic conditions, situation known produce anorexia. anorectic action leptin experimental conditions observed second experiment. specificity leptin action tested third experiment trout injected ICV saline, leptin alone, leptin plus agents known inhibit leptin signaling pathways mammals. results obtained suggest central action leptin glucosensing system related JAK/STAT IRS-PI(3)K pathways. Finally, also provide evidence peripheral effect central leptin treatment (increased liver glycogenolytic potential), could associated increased sympathetic activity.
