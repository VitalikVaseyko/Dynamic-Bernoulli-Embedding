 Previously, proposed new model understanding Warburg effect tumorigenesis metastasis. model, stromal fibroblasts would undergo aerobic glycolysis (a.k.a., Warburg effect)--producing secreting increased pyruvate/lactate could used adjacent epithelial cancer cells "fuel" mitochondrial TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production. test model directly, used matched set metabolically well-characterized immortalized fibroblasts differ single gene. CL3 fibroblasts show shift towards oxidative metabolism, increased mitochondrial mass. contrast, CL4 fibroblasts show shift towards aerobic glycolysis, reduced mitochondrial mass. validated differences CL3 CL4 fibroblasts performing unbiased proteomics analysis, showing functional upregulation 4 glycolytic enzymes, namely ENO1, ALDOA, LDHA TPI1, CL4 fibroblasts. Many proteins upregulated CL4 fibroblasts, seen unbiased proteomics, also transcriptionally upregulated stroma human breast cancers, especially patients prone metastasis. Importantly, CL4 fibroblasts co-injected human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) xenograft model, tumor growth dramatically enhanced. CL4 fibroblasts induced > 4-fold increase tumor mass, near 8-fold increase tumor volume, without measurable increases tumor angiogenesis. parallel, CL3 CL4 fibroblasts failed form tumors injected alone, without epithelial cancer cells. Mechanistically, co-culture conditions, CL4 glycolytic fibroblasts increased mitochondrial activity adjacent breast cancer cells (relative CL3 cells), consistent "Reverse Warburg Effect". Notably, Western blot analysis CL4 fibroblasts revealed significant reduction caveolin-1 (Cav-1) protein levels. human breast cancer patients, loss stromal Cav-1 associated increased risk early tumor recurrence, metastasis, tamoxifen-resistance, poor clinical outcome. Thus, loss stromal Cav-1 may effective marker predicting "Reverse Warburg Effect" stroma human breast cancer patients. such, CL4 fibroblasts new attractive model mimicking "glycolytic phenotype" cancer-associated fibroblasts. Nutrients derived glycolytic cancer associated fibroblasts could provide escape mechanism confer drug-resistance anti-angiogenic therapy, effectively reducing dependence cancer cells vascular blood supply.
