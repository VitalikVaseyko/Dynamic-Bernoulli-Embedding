 Despite many decades study lack quantitative explanation Warburg effect cancer. propose glycogen shunt, pathway recently shown critical cancer cell survival, may explain excess lactate generation aerobic conditions characteristic Warburg effect. proposal based research yeast mammalian muscle brain demonstrates glycogen shunt functions maintain homeostasis glycolytic intermediates ATP large shifts glucose supply demand. Loss glycogen shunt leads cell death substrate stress. Similarities glycogen shunt yeast cancer cells lead us propose parallel explanation lactate produced cancer cells Warburg effect. model also explains need active tetramer inactive dimer forms pyruvate kinase (PKM2) cancer cells, similar two forms Pyk2p yeast, critical regulating glycogen shunt flux. novel role proposed glycogen shunt implicates high activities glycogen synthase fructose bisphosphatase tumors potential targets therapy.
