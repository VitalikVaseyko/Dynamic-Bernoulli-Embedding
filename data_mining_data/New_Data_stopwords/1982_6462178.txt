 influence thyroxine key enzymes involved glycolytic pentose phosphate pathways testes pre-pubertal; pubertal adult rats studied. Thyroxine-induced (25 micrograms/100 g body weight) hyperthyroidism 1 month resulted change either hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) activity testes rats age group studied. However, pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activity reduced significantly pre-pubertal pubertal rats. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44) activities markedly increased thyroxine treatment. Withdrawal hormone treatment resulted reversion enzyme activities towards normal. results suggest thyroxine age-dependent, specific effect testicular pyruvate kinase activity. Thyroid hormone may direct control pentose phosphate pathway testis.
