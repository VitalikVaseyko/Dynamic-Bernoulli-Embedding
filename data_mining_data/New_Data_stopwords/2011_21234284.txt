 Cancer cells re-program metabolic machinery order satisfy bioenergetic biosynthetic requirements. critical aspect re-programming cancer cell metabolism involves changes glycolytic pathway (referred "Warburg effect"). outcome changes, much pyruvate generated via glycolytic pathway converted lactic acid, rather used produce acetyl-CoA ultimately, citrate enters citric acid cycle. order compensate changes help maintain functioning citric acid cycle, cancer cells often rely elevated glutamine metabolism. Recently, found achieved marked elevation glutaminase activity cancer cells. consider findings possible mechanisms important metabolic activity regulated.
