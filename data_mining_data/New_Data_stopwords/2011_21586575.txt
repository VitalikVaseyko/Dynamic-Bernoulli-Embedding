 conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA mitochondria catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Activity PDC inhibited phosphorylation via pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs). Here, examined regulation Pdk4 gene expression CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta). C/EBPbeta modulates expression multiple hepatic genes including involved metabolism, development, inflammation. found C/EBPbeta induced Pdk4 gene expression decreased PDC activity. transcriptional induction mediated two C/EBPbeta binding sites Pdk4 promoter. C/EBPbeta participates hormonal regulation gluconeogenic genes. Previously, reported Pdk4 induced thyroid hormone (T(3)). Therefore, investigated role C/EBPbeta T(3) regulation Pdk4. T(3) increased C/EBPbeta abundance primary rat hepatocytes. Knockdown C/EBPbeta siRNA diminished T(3) induction Pdk4 carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt1a) genes. CPT1a initiating step mitochondrial oxidation long chain fatty acids. results indicate C/EBPbeta stimulates Pdk4 expression participates T(3) induction Cpt1a Pdk4 genes.
