 effects phosphorus nutrition several physiological biochemical parameters green alga, Selenastrum minutum, examined. Algal cells cultured chemostats conditions either Pi limitation nutrient sufficiency. Pi limitation resulted in: (a) 5-fold lower rate respiration, (b) 3-fold decline rates photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation oxygen evolution, (c) 3-fold higher rate dark carbon dioxide fixation, (d) significant increases activities phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase PEP phosphatase (128% 158% nutrient sufficient activities, respectively), (e) significant reductions activities nonphosphorylating NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase NAD malic enzyme, (f) change levels ATP:fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, phosphorylating NAD-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase. intracellular concentrations Pi, ATP, AMP, soluble protein, chlorophyll also significantly reduced response Pi limitation. well, level ADP 11-fold lower Pi-limited cells compared nutrient sufficient controls. predicted low level ADP, pyruvate kinase catalyzed conversion PEP pyruvate may restricted Pi-limited cells. Pi limitation, PEP carboxylase PEP phosphatase may function "bypass" ADP dependent pyruvate kinase, well recycle Pi reassimilation cellular metabolism.
