 Anoikis resistance, ability cells live detached extracellular matrix, property epithelial cancers. "Warburg effect," preference cancer cells glycolysis energy production even presence oxygen, shown evident various tumors. Since cancer cell's metastatic ability depends microenvironmental conditions (nutrients, stromal cells, vascularization) highly variable different organs, cellular metabolic fluxes nutrient demand may show considerable differences. Moreover, cancer cell's metastatic ability, dependent stage cancer, may create metabolic alterations depending microenvironment. Although recent studies aimed elucidate cancer cell metabolism detached conditions, nutrient demand metabolic activity cancer cells nonadherent conditions remain poorly understood. Additionally, less known metabolic alterations ovarian cancer cells varying invasive capability anoikis conditions. hypothesized metabolism highly invasive ovarian cancer cells detachment would differ less invasive ovarian cancer cells ovarian cancer cells altered metabolism detached vs. attached conditions. assess metabolic differences, integrated secretomics-based metabolic footprinting (MFP) approach mitochondrial bioenergetics. Interestingly, MFP revealed higher pyruvate uptake oxygen consumption invasive ovarian cancer cells less invasive counterparts. Furthermore, ATP production higher invasive vs. less invasive ovarian cancer cells detachment. found pyruvate effect highly invasive ovarian cancer cells' migration ability. results first demonstrate higher mitochondrial activity related higher ovarian cancer invasiveness detached conditions. Importantly, results bring insights regarding metabolism cancer cells nonadherent conditions could lead development therapies modulating cancer cell invasiveness.
