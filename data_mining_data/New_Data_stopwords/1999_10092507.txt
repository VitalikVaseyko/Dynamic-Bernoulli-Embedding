 L-III transcriptional regulatory element rat pyruvate kinase L gene located -170 -150 base pairs upstream hepatocyte-specific transcription initiation site. L-III element necessary cell type-specific expression also transcriptional stimulation carbohydrates, also referred carbohydrate-response element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using rat liver nuclear extract showed L-III element-binding protein (L-IIIBP) observed multiple bands. bands disappeared nuclear extract preincubated 60 degrees C 5 min competed unlabeled L-III oligonucleotide unlabeled adenovirus major late promoter E box oligonucleotide. addition, bands affected presence antiserum upstream stimulating factor (USF). Thus, conclude L-IIIBP different USF. Then, heat-labile L-IIIBP purified rat liver nuclear extracts. Purified L-IIIBP exhibited two bands sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis silver staining. Ultraviolet crosslinking experiment showed bands binding activity L-III oligonucleotide.
