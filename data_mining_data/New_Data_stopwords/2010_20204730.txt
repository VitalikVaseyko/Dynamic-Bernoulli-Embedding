 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) disease pulmonary vasculature characterized vascular obstruction progressive right ventricular failure. One hallmark clinical PAH poor survival, PAH mortality rates approximating many malignancies. discovery fawn-hooded rat strain (FHR) spontaneously develops PAH allowed major insights pathophysiology PAH. findings revealed cancer PAH share similarly poor prognosis also demonstrate similar resistance apoptosis activation cell proliferation major pathophysiologic mechanism. One causes resistance apoptosis increased proliferation pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells PAH cancer-like metabolic shift towards glycolytic metabolism (Warburg effect) down-regulation mitochondrial glucose oxidation. book chapter review role metabolic shift pathophysiology PAH also highlight emerging anti-proliferative PAH therapies correct metabolic dysregulation PAH.
