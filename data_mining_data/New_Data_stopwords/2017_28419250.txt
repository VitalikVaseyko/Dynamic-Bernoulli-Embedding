 Arsenite well established human carcinogen, molecular mechanisms leading arsenite-induced carcinogenesis complex elusive. Accelerated glycolysis, common process tumor cells called Warburg effect, associated various biological phenomena. However, role glycolysis induced arsenite unknown. found that, chronic exposure arsenite, L-02 cells undergo metabolic shift glycolysis. liver cells exposed arsenite, hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT-4) over-expressed. MCT-4, directly mediated HIF-1alpha, maintains high level glycolysis, enhanced glycolysis promotes pro-inflammatory properties, involved arsenite carcinogenesis. addition, serum lactate cytokines higher arsenite-exposed human populations, positive correlation them. Moreover, positive relationship lactate cytokines arsenic hair. sum, findings indicate MCT-4, mediated HIF-1alpha, enhances glycolysis induced arsenite. Lactate, end product glycolysis, released extracellular environment. acidic microenvironment promotes production pro-inflammatory cytokines, contribute arsenite-induced liver carcinogenesis. results provide link induction glycolysis inflammation liver cells exposed arsenite, thus establish previously unknown mechanism arsenite-induced hepatotoxicity.
