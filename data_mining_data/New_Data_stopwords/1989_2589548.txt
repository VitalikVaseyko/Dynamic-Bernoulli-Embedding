 purpose study investigate possible alterations induced sepsis endotoxicosis late phase Ca2+-dependent signaling rat liver. Hepatocytes isolated septic chronically endotoxin (ET)-treated rats labeled [32P]H3PO4 stimulated various agents. Proteins resolved one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiographed. Vasopressin (VP)- phenylephrine (PE)-induced responses attenuated septic ET-treated rats cytosolic membrane proteins compared respective controls. Glucagon 12-O-myristate phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) affected phosphorylation membrane proteins. Glucagon-induced changes phosphorylation membrane proteins affected sepsis endotoxicosis, whereas TPA-stimulated phosphorylation lowered endotoxicosis. Response Ca2+ ionophore A23187 depressed septic rats cytosolic proteins. phosphorylation two cytosolic proteins, i.e., 93 61 kDa (previously identified glycogen phosphorylase pyruvate kinase, respectively), response VP, PE, A23187 severely impaired endotoxicosis sepsis. TPA affect phosphorylation state two proteins. results show sepsis endotoxicosis produce perturbations phosphorylation step Ca2+ transmembrane signaling. changes explain alterations glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis associated sepsis endotoxicosis.
