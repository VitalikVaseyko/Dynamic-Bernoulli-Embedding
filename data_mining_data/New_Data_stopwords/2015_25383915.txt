 Upregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) observed variety cancers. Inhibition PDHK offers attractive opportunity development novel cancer therapies. obtain novel PDHK inhibitors, took advantage homology ATP-binding pocket Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) PDHK, utilized 4,5-diarylisoxazole based HSP90 inhibitor structural design. efforts led identification 5k inhibited PDHK1 IC50 value 17 nM, which, however, showed marginal cellular activity. structural optimization resulted compound 11a improved cellular activity could effectively modulate metabolic profile cancer cells lead inhibition cancer cell proliferation, evidenced increased oxidative phosphorylation decreased glycolysis associated oxidative stress. results suggested 11a excellent lead compound favorable biological tool evaluate therapeutic potential PDHK HSP90 dual inhibitors treatment cancer.
