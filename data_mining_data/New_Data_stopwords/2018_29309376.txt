 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency common defect glycolytic pathway leading congenital hemolytic anemia. present case 18-year-old boy chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, remarkable sensitivity heat. Moreover, patient showed clinical impairment last year. reason, excluded immunologic infectious nature (malaria, babesia), may play role worsening anemia. Red blood cell enzyme assay showed presence significant increase enzyme activities, except PK, suggesting PK deficiency patient. molecular analysis PK-LR gene revealed presence novel homozygote missense mutation (c.581G>C, p.Arg194Pro). mutant enzyme displayed heat instability. addition, analyzed bilirubin uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 gene revealed heterozygous state ([TA]6/[TA]7). clear diagnosis PK deficiency, patient underwent splenectomy.
