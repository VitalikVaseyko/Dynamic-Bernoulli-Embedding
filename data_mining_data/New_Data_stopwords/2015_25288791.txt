 Gluconeogenesis active pathway Leishmania amastigotes essential survival within mammalian cells. However, knowledge pathway trypanosomatids limited. investigated role glycerol kinase (GK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) gluconeogenesis generating respective Leishmania mexicana Deltagk, Deltapepck, Deltappdk null mutants. results demonstrated indeed GK, PEPCK, PPDK key players gluconeogenesis pathway Leishmania, although stage-specific differences contribution pathway found. GK participates entry glycerol promastigotes amastigotes; PEPCK participates entry aspartate promastigotes, PPDK involved entry alanine amastigotes. Furthermore, majority alanine enters pathway via decarboxylation pyruvate promastigotes, whereas pathway redundancy suggested entry aspartate amastigotes. Interestingly, also found l-lactate, abundant glucogenic precursor mammals, used Leishmania amastigotes synthesize mannogen, entering pathway PPDK. basis new results, propose revision current model gluconeogenesis Leishmania, emphasizing differences amastigotes promastigotes. work underlines importance studying trypanosomatid intracellular life cycle stages gain better understanding pathologies caused humans.
