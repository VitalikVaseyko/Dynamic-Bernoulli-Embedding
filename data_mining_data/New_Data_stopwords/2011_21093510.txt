 aim present study evaluate hypothalamus hindbrain rainbow trout vitro effect leptin treatment glucosensing capacity expression orexigenic anorexigenic peptides involved control food intake. first experiment, response parameters involved glucosensing (GK, PK GSase activities; GK expression glucose; glycogen DHAP levels) expression orexigenic (NPY) anorexigenic (POMC, CART, CRF) peptides assessed hypothalami hindbrain incubated 1h 2, 4 8mM d-glucose alone (controls) 10nM leptin, 10nM leptin plus inhibitors leptin signaling pathways (50nM wortmannin 500nM AG490). Leptin treatment increased levels parameters involved glucosensing. Leptin treatment decreased NPY mRNA levels hypothalamus without affecting expression peptides assessed. Leptin effects reverted presence inhibitors parameters assessed suggesting involvement JAK/STAT IRS-PI(3)K pathways. second experiment, observed time-dependent (1-3h) dose (10, 20 50nM)- effects leptin treatment decreasing NPY mRNA levels without affecting expression peptides assessed. Considering orexigenic action NPY fish, seems anorexic effect leptin mediated reduced expression NPY occurring hypothalamus, change related activation glucosensing system occurring simultaneously.
