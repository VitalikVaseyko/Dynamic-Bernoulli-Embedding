 early renal metabolic response studied rats made acidotic oral feeding ammonium chloride. 2 hr feeding ammonium chloride already significant acidosis. Urinary ammonia also increased ammonium chloride ingestion 1(1/2) hr significantly elevated. vitro gluconeogenesis renal cortical slices increased 2 hr thereafter increased steadily. Ammonia production slices also increased 2 hr, thereafter fell 6 hr decreased levels which, although higher control, lower obtained rats acidotic 2 hr. correlation vitro gluconeogenesis ammonia production kidney slices rats first 6 hr acidosis, 48 hr ammonium chloride feeding, two processes significantly correlated. early increase renal gluconeogenesis demonstrable glutamine succinate substrates. activity enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase increased 4-6 hr acidosis. time decrease renal RNA synthesis shown decreased uptake orotic acid-(5)H RNA. Metabolic intermediates also measured quick-frozen kidneys varying times induction acidosis. immediate rise aspartate fall alpha-ketoglutarate malate levels. never difference pyruvate lactate levels lactate:pyruvate ratios control acidotic rats. Phosphoenolpyruvate rose significantly 6 hr acidosis. data indicate increased gluconeogenesis early response metabolic acidosis facilitate ammonia production utilization glutamate inhibits glutaminase enzyme. pattern change metabolic intermediates also interpreted showing enhanced gluconeogenesis, also may significant increase activity glutaminase II part early response metabolic acidosis.
