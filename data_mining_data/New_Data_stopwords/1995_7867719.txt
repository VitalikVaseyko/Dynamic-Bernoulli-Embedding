 Cell proliferation arrest 37 degrees C (restrictive temperature) cell division cycle (cdc) mutants Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc28, cdc35, cdc19, cdc21, cdc17 correlated carbon energy uncoupling. 37 degrees C, cdc mutants diverted biomass synthesis 3 4% 8 24% fluxes carbon consumed ATP obtained catabolism, respectively, compared 48 34% wild-type strain A364A. permissive temperature (25 degrees C), wild type showed similar carbon energy coupling indexes 37 degrees C. However, carbon energy coupling indexes two- sevenfold higher 25 degrees 37 degrees C cdc mutants; e.g., 25 degrees C two- sevenfold higher amounts carbon ATP directed biomass production 37 degrees C. wild-type strain exhibited purely oxidative glucose catabolism 37 degrees C (RQ approximately 1.0), cell proliferation arrest cdc mutants temperature characterized fermentative metabolism. 37 degrees C, cdc mutants directed 50 60% carbon ethanol production; 3 12% carbon recovered glycerol cdc mutants well wild type. proliferation arrest cell division cycle mutant cdc28 correlated significant decrease incorporation radioactive precursors DNA, RNA, proteins. presence 8-hydroxyquinoline, wild-type strain underwent cell proliferation arrest also exhibited metabolic uncoupling bioenergetic catabolic behavior similar cdc mutants 37 degrees C. Experimental evidence obtained cdc19, whose defective gene product pyruvate kinase, suggests primary defect cdc mutants correlates metabolically, highly uncoupled yeast cell. results presented point existence strong carbon energy uncoupling together cell division arrest exhibited cdc mutants restrictive temperature. degree uncoupling appears tuned, least part, increase flux sugar catabolism ethanol fermentative pathway.
