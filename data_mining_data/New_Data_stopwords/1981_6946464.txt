 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) patient PK deficiency characterized according internationally standardized procedures. addition low activity, mutant isozyme displayed impaired kinetics specifically affecting ADP-combining site:Km (ADP) 3-5 times greater normal determined three different concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate). Maximum reaction velocities achieved ADP 10 times concentration normally required control PK. Substrate inhibition high concentrations ADP competitive inhibition ATP markedly diminished. nucleoside diphosphates normally capable replacing ADP PK reaction less effective mutant isozyme PK controls subjects forms PK deficiency, Michaelis--Menten constants several (UDP, GDP, CDP) significantly elevated. Whereas previously known PK kinetic defects involved substrate P-enolpyruvate, half-saturation constant K0.5s (P-enolpyruvate) mutant isozyme normal, response fructose-1,6-bisphosphate activation.
