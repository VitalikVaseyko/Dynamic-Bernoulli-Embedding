 Plastid pyruvate kinase (PKp) activity anti-(castor oil seed [COS] PKp) immunoglobulin G immunoreactive polypeptides recovered stroma envelope membranes purified COS leukoplasts subfractionated sucrose density gradient centrifugation. PKp highly purified isolated leukoplasts using anion-exchange ADP-agarose chromatographies. Proteolysis PKp almost entirely eliminated including 2,2[prime]-dipyridyl disulfide purification buffers. final preparation contained 63.5-kD ([alpha] subunit) 54-kD ([beta] subunit) polypeptides stained protein cross-reacted anti-(COS PKp) immunoglobulin G similar intensities. two polypeptides co-eluted following gel-filtration chromatography co-migrated nondenaturing isoelectric focusing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. enzyme's native Mr estimated 334,000. PKp thus appears exist [alpha]3[beta]3-heterohexamer. Comparison respective N-terminal sequences [alpha] [beta] subunits deduced amino acid sequences several PKp cDNAs indicated (a) [alpha] [beta] subunits encoded COS genes previously designated PKpA PKpG, respectively, (b) respective transit peptides 4.8- 5.5-kD cleaved [alpha] [beta] subunit preproteins following translocation leukoplast.
