 activity hepatic fatty acid oxidation enzymes rats fed linseed perilla oils rich alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-18:3) compared rats fed safflower oil rich linoleic acid (18:2) saturated fat (palm oil). Palm safflower oils essentially devoid alpha-18:3. palmitoyl-CoA oxidation rates mitochondrial peroxisomal pathways liver homogenates significantly higher rats fed linseed oil fed palm safflower oils. Among rats fed diets containing palm oil, safflower oil, fat mixtures composed safflower perilla oils (2:1, w/w 1:2, w/w), perilla oil, mitochondrial peroxisomal fatty oxidation rates increased increasing dietary levels perilla oil. Compared palm safflower oils, dietary alpha-18:3 either form linseed perilla oils profoundly increased activity carnitine palmitoyltransferase, acyl-CoA oxidase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. Smaller significant increases dietary alpha-18:3 activity acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, delta 3, delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase also observed. Unexpectedly, dietary alpha-18:3 greatly reduced activity 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Compared palm oil, dietary polyunsaturated fats significantly reduced activity fatty acid synthetase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. activity pyruvate kinase significantly higher rats fed palm oil fed polyunsaturated fats. extent reduction prominent polyunsaturated fats containing alpha-18:3 safflower oil devoid alpha-18:3. Thus, compared linoleic acid saturated fatty acids, dietary alpha-18:3 caused characteristic changes activity hepatic enzymes fatty acid glucose metabolism rats.
