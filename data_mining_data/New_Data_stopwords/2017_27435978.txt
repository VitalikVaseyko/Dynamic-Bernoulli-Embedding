 BACKGROUND: Two variants Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 demonstrated trade-off growth rate biomass yield. addition, growth rate biomass yield also affected supplementation growth medium different amounts cobalt. metabolism changes relating growth phenomena well trade-off investigated study. (13)C metabolic flux analysis used generate detailed central carbon metabolic flux map absolute normalized flux values. RESULTS: major differences two variants occurred formate node well within C3-C4 inter-conversion pathways. Higher relative fluxes formyltetrahydrofolate ligase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, malic enzyme led higher biomass yield, higher relative fluxes pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase led higher growth rate. results tested phenotypic studies three mutants (null pyk, null pck mutant null dme mutant) variants, agreed model prediction. CONCLUSIONS: study, (13)C metabolic flux analysis two strain variants M. extorquens AM1 successfully identified metabolic pathways contributing trade-off cell growth biomass yield. Phenotypic analysis mutants deficient corresponding genes supported conclusion C3-C4 inter-conversion strategies major response trade-off.
