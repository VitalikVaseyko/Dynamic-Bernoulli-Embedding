 prolonged exercise, carbohydrate oxidation may result decreased pyruvate production increased fatty acid supply ultimately lead reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Pyruvate also interacts amino acids alanine, glutamine, glutamate, whereby decline pyruvate production could affect tricarboxycylic acid cycle flux well gluconeogenesis. enhance understanding interactions, studied time course changes substrate utilization six men cycled 44+/-1% peak oxygen consumption (mean+/-SE) exhaustion (exhaustion 3 h 23 min+/-11 min). Femoral arterial venous blood, blood flow measurements, muscle samples obtained hourly exercise recovery (3 h). Carbohydrate oxidation peaked 30 min exercise subsequently decreased remainder exercise bout (P<0.05). PDH activity peaked 2 h exercise, whereas pyruvate production peaked 1 h exercise reduced (approximately 30%) thereafter, suggesting pyruvate availability primarily accounted reduced carbohydrate oxidation. Increased free fatty acid uptake (P<0.05) also associated decreasing PDH activity (P<0.05) increased PDH kinase 4 mRNA (P<0.05) exercise recovery. 1 h exercise, pyruvate production greatest closely linked glutamate, predominant amino acid taken exercise recovery. Alanine glutamine also associated pyruvate metabolism, comprised approximately 68% total amino-acid release exercise recovery. Thus reduced pyruvate production primarily associated reduced carbohydrate oxidation, whereas greatest production pyruvate related glutamate, glutamine, alanine metabolism early exercise.
