 Adipose tissue inflammation dysfunction considered central pathogenesis obesity-related dysmetabolism, role rapid metabolic recovery upon obesity reversal less well defined. hypothesized changes adipose tissue endocrine paracrine mechanisms may support rapid improvement obesity-induced impairment cellular lipid handling. C57Bl-6J mice fed ad libitum either normal chow (NC) high-fat diet (HFF) 10 weeks. dietary obesity reversal group fed HFF 8 weeks switched NC 2 weeks (HFF-->NC). Whole-body glucose homeostasis rapidly nearly normalized HFF-->NC mice (fasting glucose insulin fully normalized, glucose insulin tolerance tests reversed 82% NC group levels). 2 weeks dietary reversal, liver significantly cleared ectopic fat, functionally, glucose production pyruvate, alanine fructose normalized. contrast, adipose tissue inflammation (macrophage infiltration polarization) largely remained HFF, though obesity-induced adipose tissue macrophage lipid accumulation decreased ~50%, adipose tissue MAP kinase hyperactivation reversed. Ex vivo, mild changes adipose tissue adipocytokine secretion profile noted. corresponded partial full reversal excess cellular lipid droplet accumulation induced HFF adipose tissue conditioned media hepatoma macrophage cells, respectively. propose early initiating reversal nutritional obesity, rapid metabolic normalization largely precedes resolution adipose tissue inflammation. Nevertheless, demonstrate hitherto unrecognized contribution adipose tissue rapid improvement lipid handling liver macrophages.
