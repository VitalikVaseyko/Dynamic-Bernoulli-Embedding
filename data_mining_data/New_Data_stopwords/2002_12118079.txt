 Quantitative proteomics traditionally performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, recently, mass spectrometric methods based stable isotope quantitation shown great promise simultaneous automated identification quantitation complex protein mixtures. describe method, termed SILAC, stable isotope labeling amino acids cell culture, vivo incorporation specific amino acids mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell lines grown media lacking standard essential amino acid supplemented non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form amino acid, case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). find growth cells maintained media different growth normal media evidenced cell morphology, doubling time, ability differentiate. Complete incorporation Leu-d3 occurred five doublings cell lines proteins studied. Protein populations experimental control samples mixed directly harvesting, mass spectrometric identification straightforward every leucine-containing peptide incorporates either normal leucine Leu-d3. applied technique relative quantitation changes protein expression process muscle cell differentiation. Proteins found up-regulated process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fibronectin, pyruvate kinase M2. SILAC simple, inexpensive, accurate procedure used quantitative proteomic approach cell culture system.
