 Paclitaxel one effective chemotherapy drugs advanced cervical cancer. However, acquired resistance paclitaxel represents major barrier successful anticancer treatment. study, paclitaxel-resistant HeLa sublines (HeLa-R cell lines) established continuous exposure increased autophagy level observed HeLa-R cells. 3-Methyladenine ATG7 siRNA, autophagy inhibitors, could restore sensitivity HeLa-R cells paclitaxel compared parental HeLa cells. determine underlying molecular mechanism, differentially expressed proteins HeLa HeLa-R cells identified two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight MS/MS. found glycolysis-associated proteins upregulated HeLa-R cell lines. Inhibition glycolysis 2-deoxy-D-glucose koningic acid could decrease autophagy enhance sensitivity HeLa-R cells paclitaxel. Moreover, glycolysis could activate HIF1-alpha. Downregulation HIF1-alpha specific siRNA could decrease autophagy resensitize HeLa-R cells paclitaxel. Taken together, possible Warburg effect activated HIF1-alpha-mediated signaling-induced autophagic pathway proposed, may provide new insight paclitaxel chemoresistance.
