 Based presence absence enzyme activities, biochemical pathways fermentation inulin Clostridium thermosuccinogenes DSM 5809 proposed. Activities nine enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, fumarate reductase, phosphotransacetylase, acetate kinase, pyruvate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase) measured four temperatures (37, 47, 58, 70 degrees C). enzymes increased 1.5 2.0-fold activity 37 58 degrees C, lactate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase increased similar rate 58 70 degrees C. acetate kinase activity observed 70 degrees C. Arrhenius energies calculated nine enzymes range 9.8 25.6 kcal/mol. determine relationship existed product formation enzyme activity, serum bottle fermentations completed four temperatures. Maximum yields (in moles per mole hexose unit) succinate (0.23) acetate (0.79) biomass (29.5 g/mol hexose unit) occurred 58 degrees C, whereas maximum yields lactate (0.19) hydrogen (0.25) lowest yields acetate (0.03) biomass (19.2 g/mol hexose unit) observed 70 degrees C. ratio oxidized products reduced products changed significantly, 0.52 0.65, increase temperature 58 70 degrees C, unexplained detection increased reduced products (ethanol, lactate, hydrogen) concomitant decrease oxidized-product formation higher temperature.
