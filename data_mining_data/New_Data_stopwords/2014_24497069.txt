 Normal stem cells variety tissues display unique metabolic properties compared differentiated progeny. However, relatively little known metabolic properties cancer stem cells, also called tumor initiating cells (TICs). study show that, analogous normal stem cells, breast TICs distinct metabolic properties compared nontumorigenic cancer cells (NTCs). Transcriptome profiling using RNA-Seq revealed TICs underexpress genes involved mitochondrial biology mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, metabolic analyses revealed TICs preferentially perform glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation compared NTCs. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated decreased expression activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh), key regulator oxidative phosphorylation, plays critical role promoting proglycolytic phenotype TICs. Metabolic reprogramming via forced activation Pdh preferentially eliminated TICs vitro vivo. findings reveal unique metabolic properties TICs demonstrate metabolic reprogramming represents potential therapeutic strategy targeting cells.
