 Considerable amounts five glycolytic enzymes glucosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, became fixed intact synaptosomes incubated glutaraldehyde. glycolytic enzymes immobilized much less procedure. lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes showed variable response glutaraldehyde fixation. isoenzymes enriched muscle subunits rapidly immobilized glutaraldehyde, isoenzymes enriched heart subunits, especially H4, not. suggested enzymes immobilized located near synaptosomal membrane, perhaps association actin, found site. enzymes showed much smaller degree fixation either randomly distributed synaptoplasm less susceptible fixation.
