 Rabbits made anemic different extents phenylhydrazine injections vary developmental stages erythroid cells peripheral blood bone marrow. found severe anemia, lower concentration glycerate-2,3-P2 bone marrow cells circulating erythroid cells. glycerate-2,3-P2 level shown rise erythroid differentiation linear relationship hemoglobin level, corresponding equation = 0.03x + 0.29, concentration glycerate-2,3-P2 (micromoles per ml packed cells) x concentration hemoglobin (milligrams per packed cells). bone marrow cells fractionated size (i.e. maturity) basis enzyme activities fractionated cells measured. accumulation glycerate-2,3-P2 found primarily attributable increase glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase activity. Glycerate-2,3-P2 phosphatase phosphofructokinase increased cells matured polychromatic stages become reticulocytes pyruvate kinase phosphoglyceromutase decreased. changes phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase appear advantageous glycerate-2,3-P2 accumulation. two enzyme activities directly responsible synthesis breakdown glycerate-2,3-P2 probably manifested single protein, glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase-phosphatase.
