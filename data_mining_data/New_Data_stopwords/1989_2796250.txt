 behaviour muscular metabolism investigated 10 patients peripheral arterial occlusive disease stage II rest maximum ergometric calf exercise. intracellular concentrations phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate adenosine triphosphate well muscle pH measured means 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy compared control group. addition, arteriovenous differences concentrations lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, hypoxanthine alanine femoral blood determined. fall intracellular phosphocreatine concentration exercise significantly greater calf muscles patients arterial occlusion controls correlated linearly increase femoral arteriovenous differences lactate, ammonia alanine. significant fall intracellular pH occurred muscular activity patient group, identically exercised control group. fall pH correlated closely rise arteriovenous lactate difference femoral blood. intramuscular ATP concentration remained constant throughout exercise procedure. behaviour directly indirectly measured metabolites permits deduction activation creatine kinase reaction, glycolysis, myokinase reaction purine nucleotide cycle exercise-induced hypoxia presence arterial occlusive disease. anaerobic production energy sufficient maintain ATP concentration even claudication pain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
