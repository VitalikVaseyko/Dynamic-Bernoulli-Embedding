 Organs flexible substrates use maintain energy homeostasis. well-fed conditions, glucose preferred substrate oxidation. fasting, fatty acid oxidation become important energy source. Glucose oxidation decreased fatty acids, process pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) play important roles. currently unknown energy status influences PDH activity. show AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation hypoxia AICAR treatment combined fatty acid administration synergistically induce PDK4 expression. provide evidence AMPK activation modulates ligand-dependent activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. Finally, show synergistic induction PDK4 decreases cellular glucose oxidation. conclusion, AMPK fatty acids play direct role fuel selection response cellular energy status order spare glucose.
