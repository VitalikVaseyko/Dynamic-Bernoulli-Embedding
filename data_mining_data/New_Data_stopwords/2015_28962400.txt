 objective study evaluate effect organic conventional grape juices consumption behavior rats neuroprotective effect activity brain energy metabolism enzymes different brain areas adult rats experimental model hepatic encephalopathy. Male Wistar rats (90-days-old) treated day conventional organic white grape juice gavage 14 days (7 muL/g). 15th day rats received carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) single dose 3.0 mL/kg. Cerebral cortex, hippocampus cerebellum dissected measure activity creatine kinase (CK) pyruvate kinase (PK). changes feeding behavior observed treatment grapes juices. However, increase grooming behavior open field test provoked juices. CCl4 inhibited CK activity cerebral cortex hippocampus rats CCl4 also reduced PK activity brain structures studied. Furthermore, white grape juices prevented decrease activity CK PK. Therefore, suggest organic conventional white grape juices could restore activity enzymes central role brain energy metabolism.
