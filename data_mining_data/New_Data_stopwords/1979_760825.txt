 Intracellular localization D-glycerate dehydrogenase (D-glycerate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.29), one enzymes pathway gluconeogenesis serine via hydroxypyruvate, studied differential centrifugation. Almost enzyme activity found cytosol. Since major activities two enzymes, serine: pyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.51) glycerate kinase (ATP: D-glycerate 2-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.31), pathway via hydroxypyruvate localized mitochondrial inner membrane and/or matrix, possible localization D-glycerate dehydrogenase mitochondria examined. Detailed analysis mitochondrial fraction prepared differential centrifugation indicated rat liver mitochondria contain D-glycerate dehydrogenase activity. Based results, cooperative connection mitochondria cytosol gluconeogenesis serine via hydroxypyruvate proposed. Possible mechanisms transport intermediates pathway via hydroxypyruvate across mitochondrial membranes also discussed.
