 Rat M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNA enriched total polysomes isolated AH-130 Yoshida ascites hepatoma cells, contain high concentration M2-type enzyme, immunoprecipitation specific antibody Staphylococcus aureus cells. Double-stranded cDNA synthesized enriched mRNA inserted PstI site pBR322, resultant recombinant DNA molecules used transform Escherichia coli. Three clones containing DNA complementary M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNA identified colony hybridization, hybrid-arrested translation, hybrid-selected translation. partial restriction map constructed covering 1.44 kilobase pairs. cloned region M2-type mRNA showed high degree sequence homology M1-type mRNA homology L-type mRNA determined dot blot hybridization. molecular size M2-type mRNA, estimated 2.35-2.65 kilobases denaturing gel, M1-type mRNA. level hepatic M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNA measured hybridization assay using cloned cDNA probe increased 2.5-fold 1 day 3.9-fold 2 days partial hepatectomy started decrease. induction followed similar changes enzyme activity. AH-130 hepatoma cells contained 100-150 times M2-type isozyme mRNA regenerating liver. results suggest increased levels M2-type isozyme regenerating liver hepatoma cells primarily due elevation hybridizable M2-type mRNA concentration.
