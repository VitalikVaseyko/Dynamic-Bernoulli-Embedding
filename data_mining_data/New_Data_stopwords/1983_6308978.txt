 oxygen limiting, animals ferment glucose via several metabolic pathways varying energetic efficiency leading various end products (such lactate, succinate, propionate). pH dependence H+ production fermentation opposite hydrolysis adenosine triphosphate formed fermentation, total number moles protons generated always two per mole fermentable substrate. However, two three times adenosine triphosphate turned per mole protons produced succinate propionate fermentations, respectively, lactate fermentation. limit, advantage would achieve balance H+ production H+ consumption ATP cycling observed aerobic metabolism, situation observed certain alcohol fermentations. Since proton balance anaerobiosis clearly adaptable, consider possible impact functions net H+ accumulation carbohydrate metabolism endotoxin shock.
