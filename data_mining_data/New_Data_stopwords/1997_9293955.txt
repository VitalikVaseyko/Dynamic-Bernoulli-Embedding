 metabolic effects insulin initiated binding insulin extracellular domain insulin receptor within plasma membrane muscle adipose liver cells. subsequent activation intracellular tyrosine protein kinase activity receptor leads autophosphorylation receptor well phosphorylation number intracellular proteins. gives rise activation Ras phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hence activation number serine/threanine protein kinases. Many kinases appear arranged cascades, including cascade results activation mitogen-activated protein kinase another may result activation protein kinase B, leading inhibition glycogen synthase kinase-3 activation 70 kiloDalton ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70 S6 kinase). explored role early events stimulation glycogen, fatty acid, protein synthesis insulin rat epididymal fat cells. Comparisons made metabolic effects insulin epidermal growth factor, since 2 agents contrasting effects p70 S6 kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase. effects wortmannin (which inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), rapamycin (which blocks activation p70 S6 kinase) also studied. studies indicate mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade probably important acute metabolic effects insulin, may role regulation gene transcription hence long-term effects insulin. short-term metabolic effects insulin appear involve least 3 distinct signaling pathways: (1) leading increases glucose transport activation glycogen synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, eukaryotic initiation factor-2B, phosphodiesterase, may involve phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase B; (2) leading effects insulin protein synthesis (formation eukaryotic initiation factor-4F complex, S6 phosphorylation, activation eukaryotic elongation factor-2), may involve phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p70 S6 kinase; finally, (3) leading activation pyruvate dehydrogenase, unique apparently requiring activation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
