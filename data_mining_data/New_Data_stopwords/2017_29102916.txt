 OBJECTIVE: aim study explore efficacy insulin-loaded trimethylchitosan nanoparticles certain destructive effects diabetes type one. MATERIALS METHODS: Twenty-five male Wistar rats randomly divided three control groups (n=5) two treatment groups (n=5). control groups included normal diabetic rats without treatment diabetic rats treated nanoparticles. treatment groups included diabetic rats treated insulin-loaded trimethylchitosan nanoparticles diabetic rats treated trade insulin. experiment period eight weeks rats treated last two weeks. RESULT: livers rats receiving forms insulin showed less severe microvascular steatosis fatty degeneration, ameliorated blood glucose, serum biomarkers, oxidant/antioxidant parameters significant differences. gene expression pyruvate kinase could compensated treatment protocols new coated form insulin could significantly influence gene expression glucokinase (p<0.05). result present study showed potency nanoparticle form insulin attenuate hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, inflammation diabetes, indicate bioavailability insulin-encapsulated trimethylchitosan nanoparticles.
