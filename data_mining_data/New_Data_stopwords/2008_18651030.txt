 present study discusses role structural organization cardiac cells determining mechanisms regulation oxidative phosphorylation interaction mitochondria ATPases. permeabilized adult cardiomyocytes, apparent K(m) (Michaelis-Menten constant) ADP regulation respiration far higher mitochondria isolated myocardium. Respiration mitochondria permeabilized cardiomyocytes effectively activated endogenous ADP produced ATPases exogenous ATP, activation respiration associated decrease apparent K(m) ATP regulation ATPase activity compared parameter absence oxidative phosphorylation. also shown large fraction endogenous ADP stimulating respiration remains inaccessible exogenous ADP trapping system, consisting pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate, unless mitochondrial structures modified controlled proteolysis. data point endogenous cycling adenine nucleotides mitochondria ATPases. Accordingly, current hypothesis cardiac cells, mitochondria ATPases compartmentalized functional complexes (ie, intracellular energetic units [ICEUs]), appear represent basic pattern organization energy metabolism cells. Within ICEUs, mitochondria ATPases interact via different routes: creatine kinase-mediated phosphoryltransfer; adenylate kinase-mediated phosphoryltransfer; direct ATP ADP channelling. function ICEUs changes selective proteolysis, also contraction cardiomyocytes caused increase cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration micromolar levels. conditions, apparent K(m) exogenous ADP ATP regulation respiration markedly decreases, ADP becomes available exogenous pyruvate kinase-phosphoenolpyruvate system, indicates altered barrier functions ICEUs. Thus, structural changes transmitted contractile apparatus mitochondria clearly participate regulation mitochondrial function due alterations localized restriction diffusion adenine nucleotides. importance strict structural organization cardiac cells emerged drastically experiments regulation mitochondrial respiration assessed novel cardiac cell line, is, beating nonbeating HL-1 cells. cells, mitochondrial arrangement irregular dynamic, whereas sarcomeric structures either absent (in nonbeating HL-1 cells) rarely present (in beating HL-1 cells). parallel, apparent K(m) exogenous ADP regulation respiration much lower permeabilized primary cardiomyocytes, trypsin treatment exerted impact low K(m) value ADP, contrast adult cardiomyocytes caused marked decrease parameter. HL-1 cells also characterized absence direct exchange adenine nucleotides. results support concept ICEUs adult cardiomyocytes products complex structural organization developed create optimal conditions effective energy transfer feedback mitochondria ATPases.
