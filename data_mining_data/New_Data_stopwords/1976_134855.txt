 Acquired enzymatic activity defects erythrocyte pyruvate kinase, glucose phosphate isomerase phosphofructokinase studied patients acute myeloid leukemias, sideroblastic refractory anemias unclassified acquired dyserythropoiesis. 6 patients acute myeloid leukemia lowered erythrocyte pyruvate kinase activity; 5 concentration "pyruvate kinase"-antigen parallely decreased, manner ratio enzyme activity/immunologic reactivity (i.e. molecular specific activity) normal. 1 patient acute leukemia, 4 refractory anemia 1 acquired dyserythropoiesis defect pyruvate kinase activity associated normal antigen concentration (and, therefore, molecular specific activity whole hemolysate lowered). enzyme activity restored incubation SH reagents two cases partial purification often performed. electrofocusing pattern erythrocyte pyruvate kinase normal types defects. two patients so-called "acquired dyserythropoiesis" erythrocyte glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency detected; cases associated parallel decrease antigen concentration. residual enzyme normal electrofocusing electrophoretic pattern normal heat stability; enzyme activity could restored treatment. 1 patient erythroleukemia 1 acquired dyserythropoiesis erythrocyte phosphofructokinase activity lowered. enzyme activity restored cross incubation isologous plasma SH reagents. one case immunologic study could performed, indicating enzyme defect mainly due decreased ratio muscle type subunit erythrocyte phosphofructokinase. electrofocusing pattern deficient phosphofructokinases normal. Finally, point probable existence several direct mechanisms, genetic post translational, accounting acquired enzyme defects red blood cells various blood disorders.
