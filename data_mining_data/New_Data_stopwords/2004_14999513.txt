 many vertebrates, short episode oxygen lack protects myocardial necrosis subsequent, longer period oxygen deprivation. protective effect, termed preconditioning, also improves functional recovery. Improved functional recovery reported hypoxia-sensitive, situ perfused rainbow trout hearts, appears absent another strain rainbow trout hypoxia-tolerant heart. results hypoxia-tolerant rainbow trout heart, however, might occurred preconditioning stimuli insufficient either intensity type elicit cardioprotective effects. present study, attempted induce preconditioning situ perfused hearts hypoxia-tolerant rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss), acclimated tested 10 degrees C, either doubling anoxic preconditioning stimulus (PO(2) perfusate <0.5 kPa) relative earlier studies using short exposures high concentrations adrenaline. addition, anoxic-preconditioning experiments conducted acutely elevated temperature (15 degrees C) increase myocardial sensitivity oxygen lack. effect preconditioning stimuli assessed measuring cardiac performance exposure 20-min anoxic challenge. addition, myocardial condition evaluated termination experiment measuring myocardial concentrations glycogen, high energy phosphates lactate, well activities pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. Maximal cardiac performance oxygenated control hearts unchanged 2-h experimental protocol, whereas inclusion 20-min period anoxia led 25 35% reductions maximal cardiac performance 10 15 degrees C, respectively. Reduced contractility, however, could ascribed myocardial necrosis, biochemical energy state hearts unaffected. Hence, anoxic exposure merely stunned myocardium. 10 degrees C, neither anoxic adrenergic preconditioning protocols improved post-anoxic cardiac performance. Further, preconditioning protocols reduce post-anoxic myocardial dysfunction 15 degrees C, despite increased cardiac sensitivity anoxia temperature. Thus, despite using strong different preconditioning stimuli compared earlier studies, cardio-protective effect preconditioning seems absent rainbow trout hearts inherently hypoxia-tolerant.
