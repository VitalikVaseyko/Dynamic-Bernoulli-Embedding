 aimed investigate mitochondrial adaptations muscle disuse consequent metabolic disorders. Male rats submitted hindlimb unloading (HU) three weeks. Interestingly, HU increased insulin sensitivity index (ISI) decreased blood level triglyceride insulin. skeletal muscle, HU decreased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) protein level mitochondria. HU decreased mtDNA content mitochondrial biogenesis biomarkers. Dynamin-related protein (Drp1) mitochondria Mfn2 mRNA level decreased significantly HU. findings provide extensive insight mitochondrial adaptations muscle disuse, involving shift fuel utilization towards glucose, decreased mitochondrial biogenesis distorted mitochondrial dynamics.
