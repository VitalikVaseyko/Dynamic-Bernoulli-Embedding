 Treatment permeabilized chromaffin cells low concentrations ATP analog adenosine-5?-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)[(35)S] results (35)S incorporation small number cellular proteins. proteins, 47 kilodalton protein heavily thiophosphorylated. Permeabilized cells treated various drugs known influence cell functions, specifically chromaffin granule function, determine kinase responsible thiophosphorylation 47 kilodalton protein thiophosphorylation associated specific cell function. Several drugs influence activity cell kinases examined effect secretion thiophosphorylation 47 kilodalton protein. qualitative effect cAMP, cGMP trifluoperazine thiophosphorylation protein. cyclic nucleotides slightly enhanced secretion, trifluoperazine enhanced unstimulated catecholamine release. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate effect secretion (35)S incorporation cell proteins. free calcium concentration medium influenced thiophosphorylation 47 kilodalton protein, increased calcium producing increased thiophosphorylation. Drugs affecting chromaffin vesicle functions used assess relationship specific functions thiophosphorylation protein. Inhibition nucleotide translocation atractyloside 4,4?diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2?disulfonic acid inhibition proton translocating ATPase N-ethylmaleimide inhibited thiophosphorylation 47 kilodalton protein, little effect secretion. Treatment rotenone markedly enhanced secretion thiophosphorylation protein. Calcium ionophores effect thiophosphorylation protein. Dichloroacetic acid, inhibits phosphorylation mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, effect secretion variable effect thiophosphorylation 47 kilodalton protein. data suggest thiophosphorylation protein may associated nucleotide translocation across vesicle membrane.
