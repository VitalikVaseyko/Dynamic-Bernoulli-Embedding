 Spontaneously contracting myocytes isolated ventricles adult rat heart. Hearts perfused retrogradally via aorta 30 minutes 37 degrees C Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing collagenase hyaluronidase. venticles divided pieces incubated 15 minutes enzymes. Dislodged cells decanted, diluted cold buffer allowed settle. washed cells sedimented 3% Ficoll. procedure yielded approximately 50 mg protein 1 gm heart. Viability measured trypan-glue exclusion 90-95%. Approximately 80% cells beating. Scanning electron microscopic studies suggest isolated myocytes morphologically intact. cells oxidize glucose, pyruvate, citrate palmitate CO2 synthesize protein RNA. Uptake glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, leucine taurine saturable. Glucose uptake stimulated insulin. cells retained LDH CPK well capacity oxidize substrates 24 hours 4 degrees C 4 hours 37 degrees C. 24 hours 4 degrees C cells resume contracting returned room temperature. procedure reported isolation spontaneously contracting, adult, rat heart myocytes provides cells high index viability greater yield previously reported methods. cells retain metabolic activity withstand storage longer periods described preparations.
