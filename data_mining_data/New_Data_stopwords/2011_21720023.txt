 Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) effective metabolic regulator glucose lipid homeostasis context insulin resistance, glucose intolerance dyslipidemia diabetic rodents monkeys, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) directly induces FGF21 expression rodent liver. Recent findings suggest effects regulation FGF21 qualitatively differ rodents humans. Here, examined effects PPARalpha PPARgamma agonists FGF21 mRNA expression mouse liver cultured hepatocytes. Intraperitoneal injection bezafibrate pioglitazone induced FGF21 mRNA expression mouse liver. Rosiglitazone pioglitazone well bezafibrate significantly induced FGF21 mRNA expression cultured mouse hepatocytes. hand, rosiglitazone pioglitazone significantly induced, whereas bezafibrate affect FGF21 mRNA expression human liver carcinoma cell line HepG2. Bezafibrate significantly induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA expression, suggesting HepG2 cells sensitive bezafibrate like mouse liver. findings suggest PPARgamma-activating antidiabetic drugs rosiglitazone pioglitazone induce FGF21 expression mouse human hepatocytes, PPARgamma rather PPARalpha might play important role human FGF21 production.
