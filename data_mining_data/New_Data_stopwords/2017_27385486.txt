 Mutations TP53 gene common feature aggressive malignant cells. addition loss tumor suppressive role wild-type p53, hotspot mutant p53 isoforms display oncogenic proprieties notoriously referred gain functions (GOFs) result chemoresistance therapies, genomic instability, aberrant deregulation cell cycle progression, invasiveness enhanced metastatic potential, finally, patient poor survival rate. identification novel functional oncogenic pathways regulated mutant p53 represent intriguing topic emerging therapies broad spectrum cancer types bearing mutant TP53 gene. Mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), well pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) master regulators cancer growth, metabolism, cell proliferation. Herein, report GOF mutant R175H R273H p53 proteins trigger PKM2 phosphorylation Tyr 105 involvement mTOR signaling. data, together newly discovered connection mutant p53 mTOR stimulation, raise important implications potential therapeutic use synthetic drugs inhibiting mTOR/PKM2 axis cancer cells bearing mutant TP53 gene. hypothesize mTOR/PKM2 pathway stimulation serves sustain oncogenic activity mutant p53 enhancement chemoresistance aerobic glycolysis cancer cells.
