 Oral diseases known closely associated oral biofilm metabolism, cancer tissue reported possess specific metabolism 'Warburg effect'. Metabolomics might useful method clarifying whole metabolic systems operate oral biofilm oral cancer, however, technical limitations hampered research. Fortunately, metabolomics techniques developed rapidly past decade, helped solve difficulties. vivo metabolomic analyses oral biofilm produced various findings. findings agreed vitro results obtained conventional metabolic studies using representative oral bacteria, others differed markedly them. Metabolomic analyses oral cancer tissue revealed differences metabolomic profiles cancer normal tissue, also suggested specific metabolic system operates oral cancer tissue. Saliva contains variety metabolites, might associated oral systemic disease; therefore, metabolomics analysis saliva could useful identifying disease-specific biomarkers. Metabolomic analyses oral biofilm, oral cancer, saliva could contribute development accurate diagnostic, techniques, safe effective treatments, preventive strategies oral systemic diseases.
