 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha, delta gamma nuclear transcription factors control key genes involved fatty acid metabolism energy homeostasis. Little known PPAR activation vivo existence overlapping functions PPARalpha, -delta -gamma. skeletal muscle important site insulin action acts significant sensor life-style-induced influences whole-body energy metabolism, investigated expression PPARalpha, -delta -gamma rat skeletal muscle response exercise four- twelve-weeks high-fat feeding, respectively. PPARalpha mRNA expression skeletal muscle increased parallel signs developing metabolic syndrome increased visceral fat pad volymes, plasma free fatty acids muscle triglyceride concentrations. PPARalpha mRNA expression up-regulated 3-fold four weeks high-fat feeding (p<0.01). Exercise reversed high-fat induced increase PPARalpha expression young lean rats (p<0.05), change PPARalpha, -delta -gamma expression skeletal muscle normal nutritional state. increase PPARalpha expression declined longer term high-fat feeding. contrast, exercise increased PPARdelta mRNA protein expression 3- 6-fold skeletal muscle longer-term high-fat feeding (p<0.05). effect accompanied reduction skeletal muscle fat content. findings suggest parallel activation PPARalpha -delta expression skeletal muscle may important adaptive mechanism response increased fatty acid loads young, lean animals, protecting insulin resistance, whereas exercise might needed mediate positive effects older animals.
