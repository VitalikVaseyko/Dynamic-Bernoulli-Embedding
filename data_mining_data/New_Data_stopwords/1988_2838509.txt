 study prompted paradox strong presence mitochondria anaerobic protozoan, recently reclassified yeasts. Stemming publication 1911 1912, Blastocystis hominis generally accepted harmless intestinal yeast humans, short standardized textbook (parasitology) descriptions, even present day. Reports since 1967 changed classification B. hominis yeast protozoan (Sarcodina), followed interest B. hominis-caused disease, resulting documentation disease humans primates. study B. hominis, basic ultrastructure mitochondria shown thin-section electron microscopy identical archetypical mitochondrion. hundreds large B. hominis cells (100 200 microns diameter). Mitochondria confined peripheral ring cytoplasm bounded outer cell membrane (there cell wall) membrane large, spherical, organelle-free central body constitutes 75% cell's volume. Mitochondria tended surround cell's usual two four nuclei. Rhodamine 123 stained mitochondria selectively, visualized fluorescence microscopy. cell devoid cytochromes. Addition 0.1% cytochrome c growth medium increased utilization glucose 34% lactate 17%. Furthermore, markedly increased number mitochondrion-filled cells. higher concentrations, cytochrome c inhibited growth cells. Despite presence large numbers mitochondria, activities mitochondrial enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase absent. Thus, function mitochondria B. hominis remains unknown. Considerable activities aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase found. Aldolase activity prominent. Pyruvate decarboxylase present. Diaphorase lactate dehydrogenase detectable suspect quantities. missing enzymes gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase (a lysosomal marker), creatine kinase isoenzymes.
