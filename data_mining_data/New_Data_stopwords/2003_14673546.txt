 effect gene knockout metabolism pflA-, pflB-, pflC-, pflD- mutants Escherichia coli investigated. Batch cultivations pfl- mutants parent strain conducted using glucose carbon source. found pflA- pflB- mutants, pflC- pflD- mutants, produced large amounts D-lactate glucose microaerobic condition, maximum yield 73%. order investigate metabolic regulation mechanism, measured enzyme activities following eight enzymes: glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, acetate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase. Intracellular metabolite concentrations glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, acetyl coenzyme well ATP, ADP, AMP, NADH, NAD+ also measured. shown GAPDH LDH activities considerably higher pflA- pflB- mutants, implies coupling NADH production consumption two corresponding reactions. urgent energy requirement shown lower ATP/AMP level due oxygen limitation pfl gene knockout, promoted significant stepping-up glycolysis using glucose carbon source. shown demand energy important intracellular redox balance, thus excess NADH produced GAPDH resulted significantly higher intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio pfl- mutants. Consequently, homolactate production achieved meet requirements redox balance energy production glycolysis. effect using different carbon sources gluconate, pyruvate, fructose, glycerol investigated.
