 AIMS: Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) plays crucial role glucose utilization lipid metabolism regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) emerging therapeutic target type 2 diabetes. date, study specifically examined relationship PDK4 gene polymorphisms type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome. METHODS: association common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) examined PDK4 [-208A/G (rs10085637), IVS3+192C/T (rs3779478), IVS6+31A/G (rs2301630), IVS7+514A/G (rs12668651), IVS10+75C/T (rs10247649)] type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome 651 Korean subjects type 2 diabetes 350 nondiabetic Korean subjects. association SNPs clinical parameters related metabolic syndromes including obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia also examined. RESULTS: significant association found studied SNPs type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, clinical parameters. PDK4 gene haplotype ACAGC showed modest association type 2 diabetes. However, significance association lost considering multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: PDK4 polymorphisms may associated type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome. studies utilizing larger study population required confirm results.
