 presence retinoic acid (RA), F9 murine teratocarcinoma cells differentiate cells resembling extra-embryonic endoderm early mouse embryo. Using differential hybridization, cloned characterized six cDNAs corresponding mRNAs exhibit reduced expression F9 cells following RA treatment. Two cDNAs encode novel genes (REX-2 REX-3). isolated cDNAs encode genes previously described contexts: 1-4 (cyclin D3); 2-10 (pyruvate kinase); 2-12 (glutathione S-transferase); 2-17 (GLUT 3). mRNA levels genes reduced RA RA plus theophylline cAMP (RACT) 48 h treatment, continue decrease 96 h. half-lives mRNAs changed RA treatment, indicating mRNAs may regulated transcriptional mechanism. isoleucine-deprived cells, growth arrested differentiate, steady state mRNA levels genes Rex 2, Rex 3, pyruvate kinase GLUT 3 reduced, contrast cyclin D3 glutathione S-transferase. expression REX-2, REX-3, pyruvate kinase, glutathione S-transferase GLUT 3 genes reduced RACT extent F9 RARgamma-/- RARalpha-/- lines F9-Wt. contrast, cyclin D3 exhibits lower mRNA expression F9 RARgamma-/- RARalpha-/- stem cells, mRNA decreased RACT treatment. Overexpression cyclin D3 blocks RA-induced growth arrest F9 cells, indicating downregulation gene following RA treatment may constitute necessary step cascade events leading growth inhibition RA.
