 transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) suggested candidate mediating training adaptation skeletal muscle. However, recent evidence rather associates HIF attenuation trained phenotype. example, muscle-specific HIF deletion increases endurance performance, partly decreased levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK-1). HIF activity regulated multiple levels: modulation protein stability, transactivation capacity, target gene availability. Prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3) induces HIF degradation, whereas factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH) histone deacetylase sirtuin-6 (SIRT6) repress transcriptional activity. Together, negative regulators introduce mechanism moderating HIF activity vivo. hypothesized long-term training induces expression. Negative regulators HIF explored comparing skeletal muscle tissue moderately active individuals (MA) elite athletes (EA). elite athletes, expression negative regulators PHD2 (MA 73.54 +/- 9.54, EA 98.03 +/- 6.58), FIH (MA 4.31 +/- 0.25, EA 30.96 +/- 7.99) SIRT6 (MA 0.24 +/- 0.07, EA 11.42 +/- 2.22) significantly higher, whereas response gene, PDK-1 lower (MA 0.12 +/- 0.03, EA 0.04 +/- 0.01). Similar results observed separate 6-wk training study. vitro, activation HIF human primary muscle cell culture PHD inactivation strongly induced PDK-1 (0.84 +/- 0.12 vs 4.70 +/- 0.63), providing evidence regulatory link PHD activity PDK-1 levels relevant model system. Citrate synthase activity, closely associated aerobic exercise adaptation, increased upon PDK-1 silencing. suggest training-induced negative regulation HIF mediates attenuation PDK-1 contributes skeletal muscle adaptation exercise.
