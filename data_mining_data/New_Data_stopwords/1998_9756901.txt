 Two maize cDNAs isolated sequenced open reading frames approximately 37% amino acid identity mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases. maize kinase sequences contain five domains conserved signature residues typical procaryotic two-component histidine kinases. Sequence comparisons identified six highly conserved motifs proposed specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases. addition, specific Trp Cys residues also invariant sequences. maize cDNAs 1332 (PDK1) 1602 (PDK2) nucleotides length, encoding polypeptides calculated molecular masses 38,867 41,327 Da share 77% amino acid identity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis oligonucleotide-specific primers revealed differential expression pattern two isoforms. PDK1 PDK2 expressed Escherichia coli N-terminal His6 tags facilitate purification. recombinant proteins migrated 44 48 kDa, respectively, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Anti-PDK1 antibodies immunoprecipitated 75% pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity maize mitochondrial matrix fraction, recognized matrix protein 43 kDa. Recombinant PDK2, expressed fusion maltose-binding protein, inactivated kinase-depleted maize pyruvate dehydrogenase complex incubated MgATP, coincident incorporation 32P [gamma-32P]ATP alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase.
