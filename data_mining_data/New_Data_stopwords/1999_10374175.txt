 BACKGROUND: Identification RBC pyruvate-kinase (PK) gene mutations polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed PK gene sequencing positive cases assessed results obtained preliminary study 15 unrelated patients Spanish origin presented. PATIENTS METHODS: Patients classified two different groups: group 1, propositus (15 cases), group 2, relatives patients included group 1 (10 males 5 females). group 1, PCR followed SSCP sequencing, group 2, PCR followed digestion specific restriction endonucleases (PCR-ER). RESULTS: Group 1: 15 patients included study 2 identified homozygous, 4 heterozygous 9 compound heterozygous. group, identify 26 affected alleles 11 different mutations: T1456 10 alleles (38.6%), T721 3 alleles (11.6%), A1010, C514, C1015 T1223 2 alleles (7.7%), C1070, A1291, T1508, A1595 T1675 one allele. Relatives 8 15 patients group 1 showed following pattern: homozygous (one case), heterozygous (10 cases), compound heterozygous (2 cases) normal (2 cases). CONCLUSIONS: SSCP procedure followed direct gene sequencing positive cases fast simple enough allow identification PK deficient variants, avoiding need biochemical characterisation semipurified deficient enzyme, cumbersome time consuming. addition, PCR-ER method useful tool screening frequent molecular variants, well as, detection carrier condition enzymopathy (family studies).
