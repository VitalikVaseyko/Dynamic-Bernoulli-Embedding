 Escherichia coli open reading frame YbdK encodes member large bacterial protein family unknown biological function. sequences within family remotely related sequence gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-GCS), enzyme glutathione biosynthetic pathway. gene encoding gamma-GCS E. coli already known. 2.15 resolution crystal structure YbdK reveals overall fold similar glutamine synthetase (GS), nitrogen metabolism enzyme ligates glutamate ammonia yield glutamine. GS gamma-GCS perform related chemical reactions require ATP Mg2+ activity. Mg2+-dependent binding ATP YbdK confirmed fluorescence spectroscopy employing 2'(or 3')-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate, yielding dissociation constant 3 +/- 0.5 microM. structure YbdK contains crevice corresponds binding sites ATP, Mg2+ glutamate GS. Many GS residues coordinate metal ions interact glutamic acid phosphoryl ribosyl groups ATP also present YbdK. GS amino acids associated ammonia binding obvious counterparts YbdK, consistent substrate specificity different GS. Ligase activity glutamic acid twenty amino acid residues tested high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following hydrolysis ATP ADP. Catalysis observed cysteine. pyruvate kinase/lactic acid dehydrogenase coupled assay used rule GS activity determine YbdK exhibits gamma-GCS activity. catalytic rate found approximately 500-fold slower reported authentic gamma-GCS.
