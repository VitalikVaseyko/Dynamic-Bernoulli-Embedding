 tumor cells take glucose normal cells metabolize glucose via glycolysis even presence normal levels oxygen, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Tumor cells commonly express embryonic M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) may contribute metabolism shift oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis tumorigenesis. show PKM2 acetylated lysine 305 acetylation stimulated high glucose concentration. PKM2 K305 acetylation decreases PKM2 enzyme activity promotes lysosomal-dependent degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Acetylation increases PKM2 interaction HSC70, chaperone CMA, association lysosomes. Ectopic expression acetylation mimetic K305Q mutant accumulates glycolytic intermediates promotes cell proliferation tumor growth. results reveal acetylation regulation pyruvate kinase link lysine acetylation CMA.
