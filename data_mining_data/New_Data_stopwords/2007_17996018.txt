 Pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) ubiquitous, low-abundance metabolic enzyme undetermined function C3 plants. activity C3 chloroplasts light-regulated via reversible phosphorylation active-site Thr residue PPDK regulatory protein (RP), unusual bifunctional protein kinase (PK)/protein phosphatase (PP). paper document molecular cloning functional analysis two unique C3 RPs Arabidopsis thaliana. first these, AtRP1, encodes typical chloroplast-targeted, bifunctional C4-like RP. second RP gene, AtRP2, encodes monofunctional polypeptide possesses vitro RP-like PK activity lacks PP activity, localized cytosol. Notably, deduced primary structures two highly homologous polypeptides devoid canonical subdomain structure unifies known eukaryotic prokaryotic Ser/Thr PKs one three superfamilies, despite direct demonstration AtRP1 functionally member group. Instead, C3 RPs related C4 plant homologues encode conserved, centrally positioned, approximately 260-residue sequence currently described 'domain unknown function 299' (DUF 299). propose vascular plant RPs form unique protein kinase family designated DUF 299 gene family.
