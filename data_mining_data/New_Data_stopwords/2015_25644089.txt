 fusion gene bcr-abl develops chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), stimulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, leading impaired autophagy. PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling also plays important role cell metabolism. Warburg effect well-recognized hallmark cancer energy metabolism, regulated mTOR/c-Myc/hnRNP/PKM signaling cascade. develop new strategy treatment CML, investigated associations among bcr-abl, cascade related cancer energy metabolism, autophagy induced fatty-acid derivative previously reported autophagy inducer. report fatty-acid derivative, AIC-47, induced transcriptional repression bcr-abl gene modulated expression profile PKM isoforms, resulting autophagic cell death. show c-Myc functioned transcriptional activator bcr-abl, regulated hnRNP/PKM cascade. AIC-47, acting PPARgamma/beta-catenin pathway, induced down-regulation c-Myc, leading disruption bcr-abl/mTOR/hnRNP signaling pathway, switching expression PKM2 PKM1. switching caused autophagic cell death increase ROS level. findings suggest AIC-47 induced autophagic cell death PPARgamma/beta-catenin/bcr-abl/mTOR/hnRNP/PKM cascade.
