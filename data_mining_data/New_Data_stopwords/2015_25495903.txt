 OBJECTIVES: Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies capri one causative agents contagious agalactia goats. disease characterised mastitis, pneumonia, arthritis, keratitis acute cases septicaemia. vaccine currently available demonstrated prevent disease. METHODS: study used two-dimensional electrophoresis separate proteins whole-cell preparations tandem mass spectrometry identify them. KEY FINDINGS: total, 145 spots successfully identified corresponding 74 protein identities. Twenty proteins found immunogenic western blot analysis using pooled serum sample experimentally infected goats. CONCLUSIONS: Six proteins found less 95% amino acid similarity closely related Mycoplasma species showing warrant evaluation development diagnostic tests. proteins dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase component pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase, 30S ribosomal protein S6, ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase D-lactate dehydrogenase.
