 Oxygen tensions major venous inputs systemic portal-vein hearts normoxic Atlantic hagfish (12.3 +/- 1.7 11.0 +/- 1.6 mmHg, respectively) low compared typical vertebrate values. Anoxia poisoning cyanide azide significantly affect situ performance systemic heart. Idoacetate poisoning, however, results significant decrease cardiac performance systemic heart 12% initial value 3 h. Activities mitochondrial enzymes hagfish ventricle suggest small potential aerobic metabolism compared aerobic ventricle Atlantic cod. Activities enzymes carbohydrate metabolism indicate similar anaerobic capacity hagfish cod ventricle. ratio pyruvate kinase cytochrome c oxidase, index anaerobic aerobic capacity, 5.6 times greater hagfish cod ventricle. Metabolite concentrations freeze-clamped ventricles normoxic hypoxic hagfish indicate hypoxia-induced activation glycogenolysis, enhanced substrate flow across 6-phosphofructokinase, apparent secondary constriction glycolysis level glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase. Carbohydrate utilization via glycolytic pathway appears essential maintenance cardiac performance normoxic anoxic hagfish. conditions severe hypoxia, ATP provision probably met anaerobic glycolysis.
