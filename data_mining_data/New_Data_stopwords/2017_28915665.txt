 ketogenic diet (KD), high-fat low-carbohydrate diet, shown efficacy treatment certain types tumors brain tumors neuroblastoma. tumors characterized Warburg effect. renal cell carcinoma (RCC) presents similar energetic features neuroblastoma, KD might also effective treatment RCC. test this, established xenografts RCC 786-O cells CD-1 nu/nu mice randomized control diet KDs different triglyceride contents. Although KDs tended reduce tumor growth, mouse survival dramatically reduced due massive weight loss. possible explanation comes observations human RCC patients, often experience secondary non-metastatic hepatic dysfunction due secretion high levels inflammatory cytokines RCCs. Measurement mRNA levels tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) interleukin-6 revealed high expression RCC xenografts compared original 786-O cells. expression TNFalpha, interleukin-6 C-reactive protein increased livers tumor-bearing mice, KD significantly boosted expression. KDs cause weight loss liver inflammation healthy mice, suggesting KDs per se safe, might contraindicated treatment RCC patients presenting Stauffer's syndrome, potentially worsen associated hepatic dysfunction.
