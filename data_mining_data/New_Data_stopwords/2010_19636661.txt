 Ethyl pyruvate (EP), simple aliphatic ester pyruvic acid, shown act anti-inflammatory molecule various pathological conditions, include sepsis hemorrhagic shock. Recently, showed ethyl pyruvate neuroprotective effect postischemic brain also KA-induced pathogenesis brain. study, examined whether aspirin augments neuroprotective effect ethyl pyruvate transient focal ischemia model complementing neuroprotective effects ethyl pyruvate. Although, neuroprotective effect aspirin attributed anti-platelet action, aspirin also direct neuroprotective effects, including NF-kappaB inhibition. Ethyl pyruvate dose-dependently suppressed infarct formation postischemic brain, wherein intravenous administration 5 mg/kg ethyl pyruvate 30 min occlusion reduced infarct volume 34.5 +/- 15.5% (n = 6, P < 0.01) untreated control. combination aspirin (5 mg/kg, i.v.), neuroprotective effect enhanced, resulting 16.0 +/- 5.9% (n = 6, P < 0.01) infarct volume. time window synergistic neuroprotection ethyl pyruvate aspirin extended 9 h post-MCAO. synergistic reduction infarct volume accompanied suppression clinical manifestations associated cerebral ischemia including motor impairment neurological deficits. Inflammatory processes including microglial activation proinflammatory cytokine expression notably suppressed combination treatment postischemic brain primary microglia cultures, wherein ethyl pyruvate aspirin modulate NF-kappaB signaling differentially. Aspirin interferes IkappaB phosphorylation degradation cytoplasm, possibly specifically inhibiting IkappaB kinase-beta, whereas, effect ethyl pyruvate seems occur nucleus, may interfere binding NF-kappaB responsive promoter elements target genes. Similar enhancement neuroprotective effect also observed primary cortical cultures NMDA Zn(2+) treatment oxygen-glucose deprivation. Together, results indicate combination treatment ethyl pyruvate aspirin affords synergistic neuroprotection postischemic brain wide therapeutic window, part via differential modulation NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
