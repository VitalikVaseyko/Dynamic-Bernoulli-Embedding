 UNLABELLED: Activation aerobic glycolysis cancer cells well known Warburg effect, although relation cell- cycle progression remains unknown. study, human colon cancer cells labeled cell-cycle phase-dependent fluorescent marker Fucci distinguish cells G1-phase + G2/M phases. Fucci-labeled cells served splenic xenograft transplants super-immunodeficient NOG mice exhibited multiple metastases livers, frozen sections analyzed semiquantitative microscopic imaging mass spectrometry. Results showed cells G1-phase exhibited higher concentrations ATP, NADH, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine G2-M phases, suggesting accelerated glycolysis G1-phase cells vivo. Quantitative determination metabolites cells synchronized S, G2-M, G1 phases suggested efflux lactate elevated significantly G1-phase. contrast, ATP production G2-M highly dependent mitochondrial respiration, whereas cells S-phase mostly exhibited intermediary energy metabolism G1 G2-M phases. Isogenic cells carrying p53-null mutation appeared active glycolysis throughout cell cycle wild-type cells. Thus, cell cycle progressed G2-M G1 phases, dependency energy production glycolysis increased mitochondrial energy production reciprocally decreased. IMPLICATIONS: results shed light distinct features phase-specific phenotypes metabolic systems cancer cells.
