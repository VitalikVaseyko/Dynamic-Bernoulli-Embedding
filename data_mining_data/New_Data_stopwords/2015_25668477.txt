 last 10 years, studies energetic metabolism different tumors clearly indicate definition Warburg effect, i.e. glycolytic shift cells undergo upon transformation, ought revisited considering metabolic plasticity cancer cells. fact, recent findings show shift glycolysis re-established oxidative metabolism required certain steps tumor progression, suggesting mitochondrial function and, particular, respiratory complex crucial metabolic hypoxic adaptation. Based evidences, complex considered lethality target potential anticancer strategies. conclusion, mini review summarize discuss paradoxical develop pharmacological genome editing approaches target complex novel adjuvant therapies cancer treatment. article part Directed Issue entitled: Energy Metabolism Disorders Therapies.
