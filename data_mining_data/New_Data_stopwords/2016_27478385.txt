 PURPOSE: expression pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) linked tumor formation invasion. Specifically, relationship high PKM2 expression prognosis evaluated solid tumors digestive system. However, prognostic value PKM2 remains controversial. METHODS: literature search PubMed, Embase, Cochrane databases conducted October 2015. end point focused overall survival (OS). pooled hazard ratio (HR) odds ratio 95% confidence intervals calculated correlate PKM2 overexpression OS clinicopathological characteristics employing fixed- random-effects models, depending heterogeneity included studies. RESULTS: identified 18 cohorts 16 studies involving 2,812 patients meta-analysis. Overall, combined HR OS tumor types 1.74 (1.44-2.11; P<0.001). stratified tumor type, influence PKM2 expression poor prognosis also found gastric cancer (HR =1.54 [1.08-2.21], P=0.018), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HR =1.71 [1.38-2.12], P<0.001), hepatocellular cancer (HR =1.92 [1.52-2.42], P<0.001), biliary cancer (HR =2.11 [1.50-2.95], P<0.001), oral cancer (HR =3.49 [1.97-6.18], P<0.001), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (HR =1.03 [0.28-3.76], P=0.968). Furthermore, PKM2 overexpression negative effect late clinical stage tumor types except pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. high density PKM2 overexpression significantly associated clinical characteristics different cancer types, tumor stage, modal metastasis, tumor size. CONCLUSION: findings revealed significant association PKM2 overexpression OS certain clinicopathological features solid tumors digestive system, thereby suggesting PKM2 might indicator poor prognosis digestive system cancers.
