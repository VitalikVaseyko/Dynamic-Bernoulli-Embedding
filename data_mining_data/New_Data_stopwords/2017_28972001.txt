 BACKGROUND: emerging metabolic theory pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests cellular mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies pathology disease. others previously demonstrated existence hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts human bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) exhibit constitutive reprogramming glycolytic mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied increased ratio glucose catabolism glycolysis versus tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, mechanisms responsible metabolic alterations PH-Fibs remain unknown. hypothesized PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression control alternative splicing pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 2, resulting increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, promotes glycolysis proliferation even aerobic environments. METHODS: Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts isolated calves humans severe PH (PH-Fibs) normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration miR-124 performed miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 shikonin used manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors used treat cells. Metabolic products determined mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses, mitochondrial function analyzed confocal microscopy spectrofluorometry. RESULTS: detected increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio PH-Fibs compared normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed glycolytic status PH-Fibs, decreased cell proliferation, attenuated macrophage interleukin-1beta expression. Furthermore, normalizing PKM2/PKM1 ratio PH-Fibs miR-124 overexpression PTBP1 knockdown reversed glycolytic phenotype (decreased production glycolytic intermediates byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation PKM2 activity TEPP-46 shikonin treatment histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS: PH, miR-124, alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates PKM2/PKM1 ratio, overall metabolic, proliferative, inflammatory state cells. PH phenotype rescued interventions various levels metabolic cascade. findings suggest integrated view vascular cell metabolism, may open unique therapeutic prospects targeting dynamic glycolytic mitochondrial interactions mesenchymal inflammatory cells PH.
