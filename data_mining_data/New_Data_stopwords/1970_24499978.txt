 Isolation tissue fragments potato tuber initiate either periderm formation including suberin synthesis cell proliferation without cicatrization effects. TCA-cycle activity shown develop causal correlation suberin synthesis (Lange, 1970). Biochemical pathways carbohydrate metabolism analysed investigating changing levels 10 intermediates activities 12 corresponding enzymes. Differences metabolic kinetics two contrasting types tissue discussed biochemical background different respiratory behaviour different histogenetic development.Glucose pyruvate well triose- hexosephosphates investigated except 6-phospho-gluconate generally show intensive rise concentration derepression subsequent degradation. several cases concomitant rise rather contrary drift concentration metabolites activity corresponding enzymes observed, e.g. phosphoglucomutase/glucose-6-phosphate, enolase/phosphoenolpyruvate. phenomenon connected occurrence suberin synthesis remains totally absent proliferating tissue.After derepression pentose phosphate shunt (6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase) strongly activated independently different histogenetic processes. hand, glycolytic pathway via fructose-6-phosphate becomes effective suberizing tissue, indicated enhanced activity phosphoglucoisomerase accumulation F-6-P.Little difference found regard hexokinase, triosephosphateisomerase, aldolase pyruvate-kinase; hand suberin formation strongly stimulates phosphoglyceromutase. high activity TCA-cycle suberin synthesizing cells must concluded acetyl-CoA formed high rate oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate, leads finally citrate synthesis. Measurements different steps pyruvate metabolism respiration suggest inhibition pathway proliferating tissue. Sim taneously certain compensatory reactions activated. activity glutamaulpyruvate-transaminase increases considerably, whereas almost entirely eliteinated suberin synthesizing cells. Moreover, malic enzyme activity showsmgreater increase proliferating tissue, large pools pyruvate, phospho(enol)-pyruvate, 2-phospho-glycerate accumulated. difference glycolytic metabolism two tissues suggests suppression periderm formation substitution cell proliferation result insufficient production precursors suberin biosynthesis acetyl-CoA fatty acids.
