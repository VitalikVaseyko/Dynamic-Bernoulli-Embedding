 Extracts heart mitochondria fed 48 h starved rats subjected gel filtration Sephacryl S-300 gave 4 major protein peaks. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex eluted void volume assayed intrinsic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity increased approximately 3-fold 48 h starvation rat. second fraction, containing peaks 2 3 overlapped, enhanced activity intrinsic kinase corresponds kinase/activator protein described previously. activity increased 1.5-fold starvation.
