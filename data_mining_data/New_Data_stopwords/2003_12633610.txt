 Altered pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) functioning occurs primary PDH deficiencies diabetes, starvation, sepsis, possibly Alzheimer's disease. Currently, activity enzyme complex difficult measure rapid high-throughput format. describe use monoclonal antibody raised E2 subunit immunocapture intact PDH complex still active bound 96-well plates. Enzyme turnover measured following NADH production spectrophotometrically fluorescence assay mitochondrial protein preparations range 0.4 5.0 micro g per well. Activity sensitive known PDH inhibitors remains regulated phosphorylation dephosphorylation immunopurification presence bound PDH kinase(s) phosphatase(s). shown immunocapture assay used detect PDH deficiency cell extracts cultured fibroblasts patients, making useful patient screens, well high-throughput format discovery new modulators PDH functioning.
