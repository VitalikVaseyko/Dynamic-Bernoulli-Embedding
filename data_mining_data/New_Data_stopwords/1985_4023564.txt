 paper describes isozyme composition regulatory properties pyruvate kinase (PK) well-differentiated (DMTC) undifferentiated (AMTC) medullary thyroid carcinomas rat. tumors chosen animal model human (neuro-)entodermal neoplasms differing degree differentiation. results compared human medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) phaeochromocytomas. AMTC characterized increased PK activity, higher apparent S0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate, enhanced inhibition alanine, presence predominantly M2-type isozyme loss M1-type-containing hybrids compared DMTC. alterations PK isozyme expression hence kinetic behaviour could demonstrated human MTC phaeochromocytomas due apparently well-differentiated nature tumors presence M2-type isozymes. results discussed reference nature significance PK isozyme shifts found tumors. suggested determination PK isozyme composition might prove useful diagnosis nueroectodermal neoplasms originating tissues primarily expressing M2-type isozyme(s).
