 Cystatin B signal transducer activator transcription-1 (STAT-1) phosphorylation recently shown increase human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), molecular pathways unknown. hypothesized cystatin B inhibits interferon (IFN) response regulates STAT-1 phosphorylation interacting additional proteins. test cystatin B inhibits IFN-beta response, performed luciferase reporter gene assays Vero cells, IFN deficient. Interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)-driven expression firefly luciferase significantly inhibited Vero cells transfected cystatin B expression vector compared cells transfected empty vector. determine whether cystatin B interacts key players regulating STAT-1 phosphorylation HIV-1 replication, cystatin B immunoprecipitated HIV-1-infected MDM. protein complex analyzed liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Protein interactions cystatin B verified Western blots immunofluorescence confocal imaging. findings confirmed cystatin B interacts pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, protein previously associated cocaine enhancement HIV-1 replication, major vault protein (MVP), IFN-responsive protein interferes JAK/STAT signals. Western blot studies confirmed interaction pyruvate kinase M2 isoform MVP. Immunofluorescence studies HIV-1-infected MDM showed upregulated MVP colocalized STAT-1. knowledge, current study first demonstrate coexpression cystatin B, STAT-1, MVP, pyruvate kinase M2 isoform HIV-1 replication MDM thus suggests novel targets HIV-1 restriction macrophages, principal reservoirs HIV-1 central nervous system.
