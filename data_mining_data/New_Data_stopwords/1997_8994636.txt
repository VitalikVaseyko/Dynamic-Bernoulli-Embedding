 Three glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, fluorine labeled yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae biosynthetic incorporation 5-fluorotryptophan. 19F NMR longitudinal relaxation time measurements labeled enzymes used assess rotational mobility intact cell. Comparison results obtained relaxation time measurements purified enzymes vitro theoretical calculations showed two labeled enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase hexokinase, tumbling cytoplasm viscosity approximately twice water. detectable signals pyruvate kinase vivo, although could detected diluted cell extracts, indicating degree motional restriction enzyme intact cell.
