 Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) recently implicated progression breast cancer. Immunostaining 342 prostate cancer specimens tissue microarrays showed COMP expression breast cancer-specific also occurs prostate cancer. expression COMP prostate cancer cells correlated aggressive disease faster recurrence. Subcutaneous xenografts immunodeficient mice showed prostate cancer cell line DU145 overexpressing COMP formed larger tumors vivo compared mock-transfected cells. Purified COMP bound enhanced invasion DU145 cells vitro integrin-dependent manner. addition, intracellular COMP expression interfered cellular metabolism causing decreased level oxidative phosphorylation concurrent upregulation lactate production (Warburg effect). Further, expression COMP protected cells induction apoptosis via several pathways. effect COMP metabolism apoptosis induction dependent ability COMP disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) signalling preventing Ca(2+) release endoplasmic reticulum. conclusion, COMP potent driver progression prostate cancer, acting anti-apoptotic fashion interfering Ca(2+) homeostasis cancer cells.
