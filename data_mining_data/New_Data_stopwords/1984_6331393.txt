Complex also inactivated ATP presence oligomycin B carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Ca2+ (which activates PDH phosphatase) pyruvate dichloroacetate (which inhibit PDH kinase) increased concentration active PDH complex concentration-dependent manner mitochondria oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate/L-malate.
