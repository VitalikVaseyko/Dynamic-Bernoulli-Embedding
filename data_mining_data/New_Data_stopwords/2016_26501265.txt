 Accumulating evidence shows activity pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform closely related tumorigenesis. study, investigated relationship PKM2 expression, tumor invasion, prognosis patients lung adenocarcinoma. retrospectively analyzed 65 cases patients lung adenocarcinoma divided low high expression groups based PKM2 immunohistochemical staining. High PKM2 expression significantly associated reduced patient survival. used small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology investigate effect targeted PKM2-knockout tumor growth cellular level. vitro, siRNA-mediated PKM2-knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation, glucose uptake (25%), ATP generation (20%) fatty acid synthesis A549 cells, mitochondrial respiratory capacity cells increased (13%).Western blotting analysis showed PKM2-knockout significantly inhibited expression glucose transporter GLUT1 ATP citrate lyase, critical fatty acid synthesis. Western blotting analysis showed PKM2-knockdown inhibited expression matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), important degradation extracellular matrix angiogenesis, respectively. observations show PKM2 activates glycolysis lipid synthesis, thereby regulating cell proliferation invasion. information important elucidating mechanisms PKM2 influences growth metastasis lung adenocarcinoma cellular molecular level, thereby providing basic data required development PKM2-targeted gene therapy.
