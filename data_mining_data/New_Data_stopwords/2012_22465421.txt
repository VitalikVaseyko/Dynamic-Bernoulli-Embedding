 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leading cause irreversible blindness industrial counties. Recent findings indicate autoimmunity involved pathogenesis disease. However, autoantibody biomarker applied clinical setting diagnosis prognosis AMD. order reveal retinal antigens targeted serum IgG AMD patients, mouse retinal tissue proteins separated 2-dimensional electrophoresis proteins immunoblots specific dry wet AMD patients IgG identified LC-MS/MS. Retinol-binding protein 3 aldolase C (ALDOC) mainly recognized IgG form wet AMD patients. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) targeted dry wet AMD level anti-PKM2 IgG antibody correlated best stage AMD. Expression ALDOC PKM2 decreased mouse retina aging whereas PKM2 deposit RPE increased aged mice. data demonstrate sera AMD patients contain autoantibodies retinal proteins anti-PKM2 IgG serves biomarker diagnosis prognosis AMD. investigation association anti-retinal antibody level expression level antigens retina needed reveal disease pathogenesis.
