 PURPOSE: optimization procedure evaluating severity inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) using non-invasive methods. PATIENTS/METHODS: One hundred nine children IBD hospitalized gastroenterology ward 2009 2011 participated study. Activity disease evaluated patient. Concentration three inflammatory markers: dimeric form tumor pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), calprotectin lactoferrin evaluated using immunoenzymatic tests. RESULTS: Existence significant correlation faecal level tested markers stage clinical activity disease demonstrated children IBD, Crohn's disease (M2-PK p<0.01; calprotectin p=0.005; lactoferrin p<0.01) ulcerative colitis group (M2-PK p<0.01; calprotectin p=0.004; lactoferrin p<0.01). significant difference level markers found children unclassified colitis group patients ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease, difference Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis. increase level one marker correlated increasing level markers (p<0.01). Faecal markers seem correlate well majority indicators inflammatory condition blood. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring M2-PK, lactoferrin calprotectin levels faeces seem useful indicator level disease activity children IBD.
