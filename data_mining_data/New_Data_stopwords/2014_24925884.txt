 UNLABELLED: Pheochromocytomas paragangliomas (PPGLs) localized (18)F-FDG PET. uptake particularly high tumors underlying succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutation. SDHx-related PPGLs characterized compromised oxidative phosphorylation pseudohypoxic response, mediates increase aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect. aim study explore hypothesis increased uptake (18)F-FDG SDHx-related PPGLs reflective increased glycolytic activity correlated expression different proteins involved glucose uptake metabolism glycolytic pathway. METHODS: Twenty-seven PPGLs collected patients hereditary mutations SDHB (n = 2), SDHD (n = 3), RET (n = 5), neurofibromatosis 1 (n = 1), myc-associated factor X (n = 1) sporadic patients (n = 15) investigated. Preoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies analyzed; mean maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) manually drawn regions interest calculated. expression proteins involved glucose uptake (glucose transporters types 1 3 [GLUT-1 -3, respectively]), phosphorylation (hexokinases 1, 2, 3 [HK-1, -2, -3, respectively]), glycolysis (monocarboxylate transporter type 4 [MCT-4]), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], CD34) examined paraffin-embedded tumor tissues using immunohistochemical staining peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization diaminobenzidine read-out. expression correlated corresponding SUVs. RESULTS: maximum mean SUVs SDHx-related tumors significantly higher sporadic hereditary tumors (P < 0.01). expression HK-2 HK-3 significantly higher SDHx-related PPGLs sporadic PPGLs (P = 0.022 0.025, respectively). expression HK-2 VEGF significantly higher SDHx-related PPGLs hereditary PPGLs (P = 0.039 0.008, respectively). statistical differences expression observed GLUT-1, GLUT-3, MCT-4. percentage anti-CD 34 staining mean vessel perimeter significantly higher SDHx-related PPGLs sporadic tumors (P = 0.050 0.010, respectively). Mean SUVs significantly correlated expression HK-2 (P = 0.027), HK-3 (P = 0.013), VEGF (P = 0.049), MCT-4 (P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: activation aerobic glycolysis SDHx-related PPGLs associated increased (18)F-FDG accumulation due accelerated glucose phosphorylation hexokinases rather increased expression glucose transporters.
