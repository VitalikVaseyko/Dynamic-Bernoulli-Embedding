 affinity label 8-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]adenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-BDB-TA-5'-TP) reacts covalently rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, incorporating 2 mol reagent/mol enzyme subunit upon complete inactivation. Protection inactivation provided phosphoenolpyruvate, K+, Mn2+ 1 mol reagent/mol subunit incorporated [DeCamp, D.L., Lim, S., & Colman, R.F. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7651-7658]. identified resultant modified residues. reaction 8-BDB-TA-5'-TP pH 7.0, modified enzyme incubated [3H]NaBH4 reduce carbonyl groups enzyme-bound 8-BDB-TA-5'-TP introduce radioactive tracer modified residues. Following carboxymethylation digestion trypsin, radioactive peptides separated phenylboronate agarose column followed reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile gradient. Gas-phase sequencing gave cysteine-modified peptides Asn162-Ile-Cys-Lys165 Cys151-Asp-Glu-Asn-Ile-Leu-Trp-Leu-Asp-Tyr-Lys161, smaller amount Asn43-Thr-Gly-Ile-Ile-Cys-Thr-Ile-Gly-Pro-Ala-Ser-Arg55. Reaction presence protectants phosphoenolpyruvate, K+, Mn2+ yielded Asn-Ile-Cys-Lys labeled peptide, indicating inactivation caused modification Cys151 Cys48.
