 Chronic exposure mammals hypoxia induces state anorexia. aimed determine role played diet restriction alterations myocardial energy metabolism occurring chronic hypoxia order detect specific effects hypoxia per se. Adult female rats exposed normobaric hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.10) three weeks; pair-fed rats, kept normoxic conditions, received amount food hypoxic rats. oxidative capacity myocardial ventricles skeletal muscles evaluated using permeabilized fibers. Several metabolic enzyme activities measured extracts myocardium soleus. Diet restriction increased activity lactate dehydrogenase ventricles augmented phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activities left ventricle depressed respiratory rate right ventricle only. Hypoxia per se induced rise hexokinase activity studied oxidative muscles fall hydroxy-acyl CoA-dehydrogenase activity myocardial ventricles. respiratory rate citrate synthase activities unaffected hypoxia. conclude chronic hypoxia per se leads specific alterations myocardial metabolism could favor use exogenous glucose expense free fatty acids without change oxidative capacity.
