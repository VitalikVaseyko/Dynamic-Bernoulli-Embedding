 effects vitamin E toxicity minute amounts paraquat fed continuously period rats investigated. Two experiments carried experiments 1 2. experiments, weaning rats divided first two groups; one group given vitamin E-deficient diet, vitamin E-supplemented control diet (50 mg alpha-tocopherol/kg diet). fed diets 40 days. that, experiments, rats fed vitamin E-deficient diet divided two groups, either given paraquat-added diet (+PQ-E) continuously fed vitamin E-deficient diet (-E). amount paraquat added 250 mg methyl viologen per kg diet. addition paraquat, two groups pair-fed. experiment 1, paraquat given rats fed vitamin E-supplemented control diet (+PQ+E). experiment 2, rats fed control diet divided paraquat-added (+PQ+E) non-paraquat-added (+E) groups, similar vitamin E-deficient rats. two groups also pair-fed thereafter. experiments, 35 days paraquat addition, sacrificed. Plasma liver alpha-tocopherol contents measured HPLC, liver peroxidation value measured chemiluminescence TBA method. And, parameters vitamin E deficiency, plasma pyruvate kinase GOT activities alpha-cysteine proteinase inhibitor (alpha-CPI) level measured. analyzed values compared paraquat-added corresponding not-added control groups (+PQ-E vs. -E, +PQ+E vs. +E), following results obtained. experiment 1, values plasma liver alpha-tocopherol levels significantly lower +PQ-E group -E group; however, liver peroxidation values values three parameters vitamin E deficiency different significantly. experiment 2, value liver alpha-tocopherol level significantly lower +PQ+E group +E group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
