 simple mathematical model glycolysis erythrocytes presented takes account ATP synthesis consumption. system described four ordinary differential equations. Conditions vivo described stable steady state. model predicts correctly metabolite concentrations found vivo. parameters involved agreement data separate steps. metabolite changes found pyruvate kinase-deficient erythrocytes species variations among erythrocytes different animals described satisfactorily. roles enzymes control metabolites glycolytic flux expressed form control matrix control strengths [R. Heinrich & T.A. Rapoport (1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 42, 89-95] respectively. Erythrocytes various species shown adapted maximal ATP-consumption rate. calculated eigenvalues reveal pronounced time-hierarchy glycolytic reactions. Owing slowness 2,3-bisphospho-glycerate phosphatase reaction, quasi-steady states occur time-interval 0.5-2h incubation, defined perturbed 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate concentrations. theoretical predictions agree experimental data. quasi-steady state flux control exerted almost entirely hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system. model describes satisfactorily time-dependent changes addition glucose starved erythrocytes. theoretical consequences discussed conditions vitro lactate accumulation existence time-independent conservation quantity oxidized metabolites. Even closed system quasi-steady states occur characterized approximately constant concentrations glycolytic metabolites except accumulation lactate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate triose phosphate.
