 Collagen production fundamental ontogeny phylogeny multicellular organisms. depends hydroxylation proline residues, reaction uses molecular oxygen substrate. dependency expected limit collagen production oxygenated cells. However, embryogenesis, cells different tissues develop low oxygen levels must produce essential protein. study, using growth plate developing bones model system, identify transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha) central component mechanism underlies collagen hydroxylation secretion hypoxic cells. show Hif1a loss function growth plate chondrocytes arrests secretion extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen type II. Reduced collagen hydroxylation endoplasmic reticulum stress induction Hif1a-depleted cells suggests HIF1alpha regulates collagen secretion mediating hydroxylation consequently folding. demonstrate vivo ability Hif1alpha drive transcription collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase, catalyzes collagen hydroxylation. also show that, concurrently, HIF1alpha maintains cellular levels oxygen, likely controlling expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, inhibitor tricarboxylic acid cycle. two-armed mechanism, HIF1alpha acts central regulator collagen production allows chondrocytes maintain function professional secretory cells hypoxic growth plate. hypoxic conditions occur also pathological conditions cancer, findings may promote understanding embryogenesis, also pathological processes.
