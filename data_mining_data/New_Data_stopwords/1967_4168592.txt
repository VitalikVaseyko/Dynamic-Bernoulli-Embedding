 Administration glucose, fructose, glycerol fasted rats produced significant depression liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity within 4 8 hours; galactose ribose much less effective. compounds yielded appreciable quantities liver glycogen. depression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity glucose glycerol diminished concomitant administration 2-deoxyglucose. latter depressed glycogen formation administered carbohydrate muscle liver. rats made diabetic alloxan, depression elevated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity insulin dependent upon dietary source carbohydrate. results interpreted indicate depression certain gluconeogenic enzymes carbohydrate ingestion initiated metabolism carbohydrate extrahepatic site.
