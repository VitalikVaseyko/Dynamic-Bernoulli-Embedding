 Recent proteomic profiling mouse brain preparations using ubiquitin receptor, Rpn10 proteasome subunit, affinity ligand revealed representative group proteins bound sorbent (Medvedev, A. E., et al. (2017) Biochemistry (Moscow), 82, 330-339). present study, investigated interaction Rpn10 subunit proteasomes identified proteins: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase, histones H2A H2B. study revealed: (i) quantitative affinity interaction proteasome subunit immobilized Biacore-3000 optical biosensor cuvette GAPDH (Kd = 2.4.10(-6) M) pyruvate kinase (Kd = 2.8.10(-5) M); (ii) quantitative high-affinity interaction immobilized histones H2A H2B Rpn10 subunit (Kd values 6.5.10(-8) 3.2.10(-9) M, respectively). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed presence ubiquitin signature (GG) highly purified preparation GAPDH. suggest binding (especially high-affinity binding) non-ubiquitinated proteins Rpn10 proteasome subunit regulate functioning proteasomal ubiquitin receptor (by competing ubiquitinated substrates) promote activation pathways proteolytic degradation proteins destined proteasome.
