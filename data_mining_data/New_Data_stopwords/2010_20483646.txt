 Cancer cells characterized increased aerobic glycolysis, correlates negative prognosis. Although correlation well known, mechanism elevated rate glycolysis cancer role glycolytic enzymes yet determined. present work aims evaluate activity major enzymes regulate glycolysis breast cancer cell lines varying aggressiveness. MCF10A, MCF-7 MDA-mb-231 human breast-derived cell lines non-tumorigenic, tumorigenic metastatic profiles, respectively. cell lines increasing degrees glycolytic efficiency, i.e., lactate produced per glucose consumed, corresponding metastatic potential. Although, differences phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activities, activity hexokinase (HK) activity higher tumorigenic cell lines compared MCF10A cells. difference HK activity observed MCF-7 MDA-mb-231 cells, suggesting difference glycolytic efficiency could attributed enzyme. However, find expression PFK-L isoform directly strongly correlates aggressiveness glycolytic efficiency cell lines. Thus, conclude glycolytic efficiency, important survival cancer cells, depends primarily preferential expression PFK-L P isoforms.
