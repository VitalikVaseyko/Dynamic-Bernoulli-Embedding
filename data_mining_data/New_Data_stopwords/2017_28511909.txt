 Tumor cells switch glucose metabolism aerobic glycolysis expressing pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) low active form, providing glycolytic intermediates building blocks biosynthetic processes, thereby supporting cell proliferation. Activation PKM2 invert aerobic glycolysis oxidative metabolism prevent cancer growth. Thus, PKM2 gained attention promising cancer therapy target. obtain novel PKM2 activators, conducted high-throughput screening (HTS). Among several hit compounds, fragment-like hit compound low potency high ligand efficiency identified. Two molecules hit compound bound one activator binding site, molecules linked based crystal structure. Since linkage succeeded maintaining original position hit compound, obtained compound exhibited highly improved potency vitro assay. linked compound also showed PKM2 activating activity cell based assay, cellular growth inhibition A549 cancer cell line. Discovery novel scaffold binding mode linked compound provides valuable platform structure-guided design PKM2 activators.
