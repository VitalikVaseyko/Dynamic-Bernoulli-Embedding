 Male ninespine sticklebacks, Pungitius pungitius, acclimated 3 degrees C higher activities mitochondrial enzymes axial muscles males acclimated 20 degrees C. Phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activities tended higher cold warm acclimated males. females, warm acclimation tended decrease mitochondrial enzyme activities. thermal acclimation change physical condition anatomic parameters sticklebacks, enzymatic changes seem due mobilization somatic reserves. Field acclimatization warm temperatures led marked decrease physical condition males females. decrease physical condition could largely attributed atrophy carcass mass. Spring males higher activities phosphofructokinase, citrate synthase cytochrome oxidase axial muscle summer males. Again, females showed less marked response. data suggest environmental temperature major determinant muscle aerobic capacity, least male ninespine sticklebacks. Thus, northern temperate zone fish retain capacity thermal compensation, much like temperate zone counterparts.
