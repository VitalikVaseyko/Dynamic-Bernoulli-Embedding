 Transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants expressing movement protein (MP) tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) control promoters class patatin gene (B33) nuclear photosynthesis gene (ST-LS1) employed explore mode viral protein interacts cellular metabolism change carbohydrate allocation. Dye-coupling experiments established expression TMV-MP alters plasmodesmal function potato leaves tubers expressed respective tissues. However, whereas size-exclusion limit mesophyll plasmodesmata increased value greater 9.4 kD, size limit smaller plasmodesmata interconnecting tuber parenchyma cells. Starch sugars accumulated potato leaves significantly lower levels plants expressing TMV-MP ST-LS1 promoter, rate sucrose efflux petioles latter higher compared controls. interesting effect expressed mature plants tuber initiation. effect carbohydrate levels found plants expressing protein B33 promoter. results discussed terms mode TMV-MP exerts influence carbon metabolism photoassimilate translocation, possible role plasmodesmal function controlling processes.
