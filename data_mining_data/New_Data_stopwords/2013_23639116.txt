 [FeFe]-hydrogenase-like genes encode [Fe4 S4]-containing proteins ubiquitous eukaryotic cells. humans, iron-only hydrogenase-like protein 1 (IOP1) represses hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha subunit (HIF1-alpha) normal atmospheric partial O2 pressure (normoxia, 21 kPa O2). yeasts, nar1 mutant cannot grow 21 kPa O2, develop lower O2 pressure (2 kPa O2). show plant [FeFe]-hydrogenase-like GOLLUM genes essential plant development cell cycle progression. mutant phenotypes plants seen normoxic conditions, conditions mild hypoxia (5 kPa O2). Transcriptomic metabolomic experiments showed mutation enhances expression hypoxia-induced genes normal atmospheric O2 conditions changes cellular content metabolites related energy metabolism. conclusion, [FeFe]-hydrogenase-like proteins play central role eukaryotes including adaptation plants ambient O2 partial pressure.
