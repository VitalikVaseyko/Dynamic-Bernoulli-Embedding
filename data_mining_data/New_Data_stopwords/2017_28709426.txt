 BACKGROUND: Retinal ischemia-related eye diseases result visual dysfunction. study investigates protective effects mechanisms Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction (XFZYD) respect retinal ischemia. METHODS: Retinal ischemia (I) induced Wistar rats high intraocular pressure (HIOP) 120 mmHg 1 h, followed reperfusion ischemic eye; fellow untreated eye acted control. Electroretinogram (ERG), biochemistry histopathology investigations performed. RESULTS: Significant ischemic changes occurred ischemia including decreased ERG b-wave ratios, less numerous retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), reduced inner retinal thickness, fewer choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) labeled amacrine cell bodies, increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity increased vimentin Muller immunolabeling. accompanied significant increases mRNA/protein concentrations vascular endothelium growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, pyruvate kinase M2 retinoblastoma-binding protein 2. ischemic changes concentration-dependently significantly altered XFZYD given seven consecutive days retina ischemia, compared vehicle. alterations included enhanced ERG b-wave amplitudes, numerous RGCs, enhanced inner retinal thickness, greater number ChAT immunolabeled amacrine cell bodies decreased GFAP/vimentin immunoreactivity. Furthermore, decreased mRNA levels VEGF, HIF-1alpha, PKM2, RBP2 also found. Reduced protein concentrations VEGF, HIF-1alpha, PKM2, RBP2 also demonstrated. Furthermore, inhibition ischemia-associated increased ratios (target protein/beta-actin) protein levels VEGF, HIF-1alpha, PKM2, RBP2, induced Shikonin, JIB-04 Avastin. CONCLUSION: XFZYD would seem protect well-known retinal ischemic changes via synergistic inhibition RBP2 PKM2, well down-regulation HIF-1alpha reduction VEGF secretion.
