 PEL B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, occurring predominantly lymphomatous effusion body cavities, characterized aggressive clinical course, standard therapy. Based previous reports PEL cells display Warburg phenotype, hypothesized highly hypoxic environment grow vivo makes reliant glycolysis, vulnerable drugs targeting pathway. established indeed PEL cells hypoxia sensitive glycolysis inhibition. Furthermore, since PI3K/Akt/mTOR proposed drug target PEL, ascertained pathway-specific inhibitors, namely dual PI3K mTOR inhibitor, PF-04691502, Akt inhibitor, Akti 1/2, display improved cytotoxicity PEL cells hypoxic conditions. Unexpectedly, found drugs reduce lactate production/extracellular acidification rate, and, combination glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), shift PEL cells metabolism aerobic glycolysis towards oxidative respiration. Moreover, associations possess strong synergistic cytotoxicity towards PEL cells, thus may reduce adverse reaction vivo, displaying low toxicity normal lymphocytes. Finally, showed association 2-DG PF-04691502 maintains cytotoxic proapoptotic effect also PEL cells co-cultured human primary mesothelial cells, condition known mimic vivo environment exert protective pro-survival action. together, results provide compelling rationale clinical development new therapies treatment PEL, based combined targeting glycolytic metabolism constitutively activated signaling pathways.
