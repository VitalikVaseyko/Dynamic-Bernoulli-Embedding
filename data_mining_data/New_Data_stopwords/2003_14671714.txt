 assess role noradrenaline (NA) possible regulator brain energy metabolism teleost fish, impact increased noradrenaline levels within brain several parameters energy metabolism assessed rainbow trout brain. Accordingly, two different doses noradrenaline, producing increases brain NA levels comparable occurring several physiological processes nature, selected. subsequent set three different experiments, fish intracerebroventricularly injected 1 microL 100 g(-1) body weight Cortland saline alone (control) containing NA (5 nmol NA 10 nmol NA); 30 min, brain plasma samples taken assess changes parameters energy metabolism due NA treatment. results obtained clearly show dose-dependent changes NA-treated fish several parameters, including decreased glycogen ATP levels, increased lactate pyruvate levels, decreased fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity, increased pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activities. Altogether, present experiments show first time teleost fish evidence supporting increased noradrenaline levels brain elicit metabolic changes brain (enhanced glycogenolysis glycolysis), resulting increased energy demand. metabolic changes may related occurring several physiological conditions nature hypoxia, increased energy demand increased noradrenaline levels occur brain simultaneously.
