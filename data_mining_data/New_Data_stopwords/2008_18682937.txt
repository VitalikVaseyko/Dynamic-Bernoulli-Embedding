 PURPOSE: Tumour hypoxia elevated glycolysis (Warburg effect) predict poor prognosis. parameter assessable separately positron emission tomography, linked anaerobic glycolysis (Pasteur effect). Here, compare oxygenation-dependent retention fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([(18)F]FAZA), promising well-characterised hypoxia-specific tracer, fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) four carcinoma cell lines. METHODS: Cells seeded coverslips positioned modified Petri dishes allow physically separated cells share tracer-containing medium pool. Following oxic, hypoxic anoxic tracer incubation, coverslips analysed radioactivity ([(18)F]FDG + [(18)F]FAZA) re-incubated tracer-free oxygenated medium measured ([(18)F]FAZA). Next, tested reliability [(18)F]FDG relative measure glucose metabolic rate. Finally, two cell lines, xenografts established mice, tracer distribution hypoxic well-oxygenated areas deduced tissue sections. RESULTS: Three hours anoxia strongly stimulated [(18)F]FAZA retention anoxic-to-oxic uptake ratios typically 30. Three four cell lines displayed similar selectivity [(18)F]FDG versus glucose, oxic uptake anoxic-to-oxic uptake ratio [(18)F]FDG varied considerably. Although less pronounced, [(18)F]FAZA also showed superior vivo hypoxia specificity compared [(18)F]FDG. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]FAZA displays excellent vitro characteristics hypoxia imaging including modest cell-to-cell line variability binding oxic cells. contrast, usability [(18)F]FDG surrogate marker hypoxia questionable due large variations baseline (oxic) glucose metabolism magnitudes Pasteur effects.
