 demonstrated previously, liver acini draining blood intraportally transplanted pancreatic islets streptozotocin-diabetic rats altered various respects. hepatocytes acini store glycogen and/or fat, show increase proliferation well apoptotic activity. Thus, phenotypically similar carcinogen-induced preneoplastic liver foci (glycogen-storing foci sometimes also mixed cell foci). means catalytic enzyme histochemistry immunohistochemistry, investigated activity key enzymes alternative pathways carbohydrate metabolism additional marker enzymes (well known studies preneoplastic hepatic foci) altered liver acini surrounding islet isografts. addition, expression glucose transporter proteins 1 2 (GLUT-1 GLUT-2) investigated immunohistochemically. activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase increased, whereas activities glycogen phosphorylase, adenylate cyclase, glucose-6-phosphatase, membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatase decreased altered liver acini. expression GLUT-2 also decreased. GLUT-1 glutathione S-transferase placental form expressed, activities glycogen synthase gamma-glutamyl-transferase remained unchanged. changes enzyme activities line well known effects insulin resembled alterations characteristic preneoplastic liver foci observed different models hepatocarcinogenesis. remains clarified long-term experiments whether foci represent preneoplastic lesions may proceed neoplasia.
