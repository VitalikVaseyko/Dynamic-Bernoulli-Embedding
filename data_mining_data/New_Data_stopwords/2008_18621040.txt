 Mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced neuronal adaptation fully elucidated. present study investigated glucose metabolism activities glycolytic TCA cycle enzymes cerebro-cortical neurons exposed hypoxia (3 days 1% O2) normoxia (room air). Hypoxia led increased activities LDH (194%), PK (90%), HK (24%) decreased activities CS (15%) GDH (34%). Neurons incubated [1-(13)C]glucose 45 120 min normoxic hypoxic (120 min only) conditions 13C enrichment determined medium cell extract using 1H-{13C}-NMR. hypoxia-treated neurons [3-(13)C]lactate release medium 428% greater normoxia-treated controls (45-min normoxic incubation) total flux lactate increased 425%. contrast glucose oxidation reduced significantly hypoxia-treated neurons, even expressed relative total cellular protein, correlated reduced activities measured mitochondrial enzymes. results suggest surviving neurons adapt prolonged hypoxia up-regulation glycolysis down-regulation oxidative energy metabolism, similar certain cell types. factors leading adaptation survival neurons others remain determined.
