 Ca2 ions showed various effect isoenzymes pyruvate kinase rabbit kidney cortex. Ca2 activated "L" type pyruvate kinase low concentrations PEP inhibited -- high concentrations latter. "M2" type pyruvate kinase inhibited Ca2 conditions studied. presence Ca2+ activating effect PDP "L" "M2" types pyruvate kinase absent; inhibitory action ATP "M" type pyruvate kinase increased concentrations 1.3 mM. effect Ca2+ pyruvate kinase isoenzymes depended content Mg2+ medium.
