 Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) lethal form prostate cancer, 26,000 men die disease 2016. pathophysiology CRPC clearly multifactorial, often, androgen receptor (AR) upregulation associated earliest beginnings AR increase part multimolecular complex including downstream effector proteins linked AR (AR-axis) responsible rapid proliferation malignant features malignant cell. animal models patients, glycolysis (Warburg effect) also early manifestation CRPC transformation. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, focused energies imaging studies AR-axis CRPC, using (18)F-FDG, (18)F-16beta-fluoro-5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ((18)F-FDHT), variety radiolabeled antibodies targeting downstream effectors, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Small-molecular-weight PSMA-targeting agents part review. review, focus molecular imaging AR-axis metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) discuss personal experience tracers. goal put radiopharmaceuticals context mCRPC biology diagnosis (e.g., (18)F-FDHT).
