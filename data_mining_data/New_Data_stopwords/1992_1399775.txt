 Two Old English Sheepdog littermates evaluated weakness developed periods minimally intense exercise. Lactic acidosis accompanied increased muscle enzyme activity, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, increased venous PO2 supported possibility defective mitochondrial oxygen use. Electromyographic abnormalities included increased insertional activity complex repetitive discharges. Muscle alterations included scattered myofiber necrosis, abundant endomysial connective tissue, excessive glycogen accumulation, greater normal numbers vacuolation mitochondria. distinctive pattern subsarcolemmal mitochondrial aggregates, referred "ragged red fibers" human mitochondrial myopathies, observed muscle biopsy samples 1 dog. Several features disease dogs, including onset weakness early life, simultaneous disease littermates, subtle nonprogressive weakness least 3 years' duration, partial reversibility lactic acidosis following rest suggestive inborn error metabolism, consistent mitochondrial myopathy.
