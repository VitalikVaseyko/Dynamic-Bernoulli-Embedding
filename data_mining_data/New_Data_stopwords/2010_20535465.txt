 series Escherichia coli BW25113 mutants reduced mixed acid fermentation constructed. Genes ackA-pta, poxB, ldhA, adhE, pflB encoding acetate kinase, phosphate acetyltransferase, pyruvate oxidase, D: -lactate dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, pyruvate formate-lyase, respectively, deleted successively. grown microaerobic condition, mutants reduced approximately 90% acetate excretion deletion genes ackA-pta poxB. Production lactate, ethanol, formate also significantly reduced deletion genes ldhA, adhE, pflB, respectively. accumulation biomass poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) significantly enhanced deleting mixed acid fermentation. E. coli mutant BWapld deletions ackA-pta, poxB, ldhA, adhE produced twice cell dry weight (CDW) 3.5 times PHB compared wild-type microaerobic conditions. E. coli mutant BWapl deletions ackA-pta, poxB, ldhA also achieved nearly twice CDW three times PHB content comparison wild-type 48 h static cultivation. Production poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB-co-3HV)] observed mutants static cultivation. E. coli mutant BWapld could produce approximately 50 wt.% P(3HB-co-3HV) consisting 5 mol% 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) aerobic conditions, seed culture inoculated appropriate time. ackA-pta, poxB, ldhA, adhE, pflB deleted, E. coli mutant BWapldf accumulated 70 wt.% P(3HB-co-3HV) consisting 8 mol% 3HV aerobic conditions.
