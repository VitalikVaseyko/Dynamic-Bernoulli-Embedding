 Ethyl pyruvate (EP) stable lipophilic pyruvate derivative. Studies demonstrated EP shows potent anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory anti-coagulant effects. Inflammation coagulation closely interacted platelet activation. However, unclear whether EP anti-platelet effects. Therefore, investigated anti-platelet effect EP study vitro. found EP inhibited agonists induced platelets aggregation, ATP release adhesion collagen. Flow cytometric analysis revealed EP inhibited agonist induced platelets PAC-1 binding, well P-selectin CD40L expression. underlying mechanism action may involve inhibition platelet PI3K/Akt Protein Kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. Additionally, EP dose dependently inhibited platelet PS exposure induced high concentration thrombin. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity assay mice platelet count implied EP may toxic effect platelets. Therefore, first report EP potent anti-platelet activity attenuates platelet PS exposure vitro, suggesting inhibitory effects EP platelets may also play important roles improvement inflammation coagulation disorder related animal models.
