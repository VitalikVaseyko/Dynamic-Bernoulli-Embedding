 recently approach analyzing human genetic diseases accurately phenotype patients sequence genes known associated phenotypes; example, thalassemia, globin loci analyzed. Sequencing become increasingly accessible, thus larger panel genes analyzed whole exome and/or whole genome sequencing used variants found candidate genes. using approaches patients unexplained anemias, discovered broad range hitherto unrelated human red cell disorders caused variants KLF1, master regulator erythropoiesis, previously considered extremely rare causes human genetic disease.
