Mean DPG concentrations greater erythrocytes marsupials eutherian mammals. opposite true ATP. Significant findings results enzyme activities were: high activity hexokinase (7.39 +/- 0.82 EU/g Hb) short-beaked echidna, pyruvate kinase (37.49 +/- 1.0 EU/g) Hb bridled nailtail wallaby glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; 41.66 +/- 1.24 EU/g Hb) black-striped wallaby. 6- 7-fold difference activity G6PD levels two species wombats confirmed. Glucose phosphate isomerase activity also shown twice high red cells common wombat compared southern hairy nosed wombat. wide variations glycolytic rate among species examined.
