 Microvessel endothelial cells form part blood-brain barrier, restrictively permeable interface allows transport specific compounds brain. Cardiolipin mitochondrial phospholipid required function electron transport chain ATP generation. examined role cardiolipin maintaining mitochondrial function necessary support barrier properties brain microvessel endothelial cells. Knockdown terminal enzyme cardiolipin synthesis, cardiolipin synthase, hCMEC/D3 cells resulted decreased cellular cardiolipin levels compared controls. reduction cardiolipin resulted decreased mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity, increased pyruvate kinase activity, increased 2-deoxy-[(3) H]glucose uptake glucose transporter-1 expression localization membranes hCMEC/D3 cells compared controls. mechanism increase glucose uptake increase adenosine-5'-monophosphate kinase protein kinase B activity decreased glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta activity. Knockdown cardiolipin synthase affect permeability fluorescent dextran across confluent hCMEC/D3 monolayers grown Transwell((R)) inserts. contrast, knockdown cardiolipin synthase resulted increase 2-deoxy-[(3) H]glucose transport across monolayers compared controls. data indicate hCMEC/D3 cells, spare respiratory capacity dependent cardiolipin. addition, reduction cardiolipin cells alters cellular energy status results increased glucose transport across hCMEC/D3 monolayers. Microvessel endothelial cells form part blood-brain barrier, restrictively permeable interface allows transport specific compounds brain. human adult brain endothelial cell hCMEC/D3 monolayers cultured Transwell((R)) plates, knockdown cardiolipin synthase results decrease mitochondrial cardiolipin decreased mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity. reduced cardiolipin results increased activity adenosine monophosphate kinase (pAMPK) protein kinase B (pAKT) decreased activity glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (pGSK3beta) results elevated glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) expression association membranes. turn increases 2-dexoyglucose uptake apical medium cells resultant 2-deoxyglucose movement basolateral medium.
