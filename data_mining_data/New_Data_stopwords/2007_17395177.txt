 Thioacetamide (400 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) administered rats. 12 h activity plasma glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) significantly higher control group, 24 h plasma GOT GPT activities strongly increased. results indicated necrotic process initiated 12 h developed thereafter. co-administration dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, 18 1 h before, 8 h administration thioacetamide: time, 2.5 ml/kg body weight, p.o.), plasma GOT GPT significantly decreased even comparable control group, showing DMSO totally prevented necrotic action thioacetamide. 12 24 h thioacetamide administration, hepatic level vitamin C, sensitive chemical indicator oxidative stress, decreased significantly, indicating oxidative stress significantly enhanced 12 h thioacetamide intoxication thereafter. DMSO totally restored liver vitamin C level, demonstrating DMSO effectively ameliorated oxidative stress caused thioacetamide, resulting prevention necrosis liver. Phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) significantly increased transiently 12 h treatment thioacetamide. results indicated oxidative stress activation JNK took place almost simultaneously. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 2 significantly increased 6-12 h thioacetamide injection. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) significantly decreased 24 h administration thioacetamide. DMSO treatment inhibited change MAPKs thioacetamide, corresponding prevention liver necrosis well attenuation oxidative stress.
