 authors describe critical study two entirely enzymatic methods determination serum triglycerides differ mainly choice hydrolytic agents: esterase hydrolase Roche methods, lipase esterase case Boehringer method. estimation resulting free glycerol requires 3 sequential enzymatic reactions (glycerol kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, ending measurement consumed reduced NAD. study kinetics analysis two stages carried using standard solutions glycerol human sera variable concentration; optimal conditions reaction time temperature drawn up. trials repeatability reproducibility day day carried together evaluation precision. method compared Beohringer's method (n = 50) using hydrolysis alcoholic potash. authors conclude use methods studied.
