 Intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetal sheep, produced placental insufficiency, lower oxygen concentrations, higher lactate concentrations, increased hepatic glucose production resistant suppression insulin. hypothesized increased lactate production IUGR fetus results reduced glucose oxidation, basal maximal insulin-stimulated conditions, used support glucose production. test this, studies performed late-gestation control (CON) IUGR fetal sheep basal hyperinsulinemic-clamp conditions. basal glucose oxidation rate similar increased 30-40% insulin clamp CON IUGR fetuses (P < 0.005). However, fraction glucose oxidized 15% lower IUGR fetuses basal insulin-clamp periods (P = 0.05). IUGR fetuses also four-fold higher lactate concentrations (P < 0.001) lower lactate uptake rates (P < 0.05). IUGR fetal muscle liver, mRNA expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4), inhibitor glucose oxidation, increased fourfold. IUGR fetal liver, skeletal muscle, mRNA expression lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) increased nearly fivefold. Hepatic expression gluconeogenic genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK)1, PCK2, correlated expression PDK4 LDHA. Collectively, vivo tissue data support limited capacity glucose oxidation IUGR fetus via increased PDK4 skeletal muscle liver. speculate lactate production also increased, may supply carbon glucose production IUGR fetal liver.
