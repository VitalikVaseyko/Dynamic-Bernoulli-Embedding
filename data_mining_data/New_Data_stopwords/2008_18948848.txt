 aim present study evaluate mouse model spinal cord injury (SCI) effect treatment ethyl pyruvate (EP). Spinal cord injury induced application vascular clips (force 24 g) dura via four-level T5-T8 laminectomy mice. Treatment EP (75, 25, 8.5 mg/kg) 1 6 h SCI significantly decreased (a) degree spinal cord inflammation tissue injury (histological score), (b) neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity), (c) nitrotyrosine formation iNOS expression, (d) proinflammatory cytokines expression, (e) nuclear factor kappaB activation, (f) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, (g) apoptosis (TUNEL staining, Fas ligand, Bax, Bcl-2 expression). Moreover, EP (75, 25, 8.5 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated dose-dependent manner loss limb function (evaluated motor recovery score). Taken together, results demonstrate EP treatment reduces development inflammation tissue injury associated spinal cord trauma.
