 Skeletal muscle transport lactate pyruvate studied primary cultures rat myotubes, applying pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator 2', 7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. initial rate decrease intracellular pH (pHi) upon lactate pyruvate incubation used determine total transport (carrier mediated diffusion). lactate pyruvate transport could inhibited combination 0.5 mM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid, 5 mM mersalyl 10 mM alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate. kinetic parameters, Km Vmax, carrier-mediated transport lactate 9.9+/-1.1 mM 0. 69+/-0.02 mmol l-1 s-1, respectively. pyruvate, Km Vmax 4.4+/-1.3 mM 0.30+/-0.05 mmol l-1 s-1, respectively. diffusion component total transport 0.0040+/-0.0005[S] (n=4) 0.0048+/-0.0003[S] (n=4) lactate pyruvate, respectively. Furthermore, observed two monocarboxylate transporter isoforms present mature skeletal muscles, MCT1 MCT4 (formerly called MCT3 (M.C. Wilson, V.N. Jackson, C. Heddle, N.T. Price, H. Pilegaard, C. Juel, A. Bonen, I. Montgomery, O.F. Hutter, A.P. Halestrap, Lactic acid efflux white skeletal muscle catalyzed monocarboxylate transporter isoform MCT3, J. Biol. Chem. 273 (1998) 15920-15926)), also expressed primary culture myotubes.
