 Warburg theory cancer postulates important driver tumorigenesis insufficient respiration due mitochondrial defects, concomitant enhancement lactate production due increased aerobic glycolysis. analysed 48 melanoma samples immunohistochemistry found 38% melanomas characterized areas isolated combined deficiencies complexes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, whereby incidence OXPHOS-deficient areas associated increased Breslow index; 62% melanomas showed high expression OXPHOS complexes. Expression carbonic anhydrase IX low, indicating melanomas generally well-oxygenated. Expression HIF-1alpha MCT4 high, might consequence increased lactate dehydrogenase levels melanomas. data indicate two types melanomas: one features classic Warburg effect, whereas one, despite glycolytic, maintains high level OXPHOS complexes.
