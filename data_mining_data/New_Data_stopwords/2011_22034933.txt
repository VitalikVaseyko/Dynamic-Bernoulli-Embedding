 wide variety viruses cause significant morbidity mortality humans. However, targeted antiviral therapies developed subset viruses, majority currently licensed antiviral drugs targeting viral entry, replication exit steps viral life cycle. Due increasing emergence antiviral drug resistant viruses, isolation multiple viral subtypes, toxicities existing therapies, remains urgent need timely development novel antiviral agents, including targeting host factors essential viral replication. review summarizes viral products target mitochondria effects common mitochondria regulated pathways. viral products mitochondrial pathways affected provide potential novel targets rational design antiviral drugs. Viral products alter oxidative balance, mitochondrial permeability transition pore, mitochondrial membrane potential, electron transport energy production. Moreover, viruses may cause Warburg Effect, metabolism reprogrammed aerobic glycolysis main source energy. Finally, viral products affect proapoptotic antiapoptotic signaling, well mitochondrial innate immune signaling. importance generation metabolic intermediates energy well cell survival, mitochondrial pathways targeted multiple independent viral products. Structural modifications existing drugs targeted mitochondrial pathways may lead development novel antiviral drugs improved efficacy reduced toxicity.
