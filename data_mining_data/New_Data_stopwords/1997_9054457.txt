 Hepatic expression genes encoding L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) S14 induced rats upon feeding high carbohydrate, low fat diet. carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) containing two CACGTG-type E boxes mapped 5'-flanking region genes. nature ChoRE suggests member basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper family proteins may responsible mediating response carbohydrate. Indeed, upstream stimulatory factor (USF), ubiquitous basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein, present hepatic nuclear extracts binds ChoREs L-PK S14 vitro. conducted experiments determine whether USF involved carbohydrate-mediated regulation L-PK S14. purpose, dominant negative forms USF capable heterodimerizing endogenous USF binding DNA expressed primary hepatocytes. Expression forms block either S14 L-PK induction glucose. addition, constructed mutant ChoREs retain carbohydrate responsiveness lost ability bind USF. Together, data suggest USF carbohydrate-responsive factor stimulates S14 L-PK expression distinct hepatic factor likely responsible transcriptional response.
