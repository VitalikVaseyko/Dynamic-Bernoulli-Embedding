 human race afflicted 100 types cancer diversified underlying genetic events. Still, altered metabolism (known 'Warburg effect') unrestrained cellular proliferation precise traits cancers, governed expression genes. obligatory energy proliferating neoplastic cells endowed glycolytic pathway, albeit, lesser ATP generated metabolic process. So, perceptible cancer cell specific signalling base transformed metabolism. Concurrently, regulators gene expression, transcription factors, observed one driving forces tumourigenesis transcriptional activation genes involved proliferation, growth survival signalling, also glycolysis. may exemplified extensively studied metabolic functions transcriptional regulator, hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1), transactivates genes major enzymes glycolysis. Preliminary investigation vital group transcription factors, homeodomain transcription factors, revealed association process development organism. homeodomain transcription factors are, however, also found involved tumourigenesis process, little information involvement cancer cell metabolism. So, review existing knowledge homeodomain transcription factor/s deciphering involvement neoplastic metabolism emerges homeodomain transcription factors influence transformed metabolic pathway circuitous manner.
