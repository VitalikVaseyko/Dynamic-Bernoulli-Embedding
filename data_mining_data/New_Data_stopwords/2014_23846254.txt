 UNLABELLED: Right ventricular (RV) failure important clinical problem available therapies, largely molecular mechanisms unknown. Mitochondrial remodeling resulting metabolic shift toward glycolysis described RV hypertrophy (RVH), unknown whether beneficial detrimental. clinically RV failure follows period compensation, transition compensated (cRVH) decompensated hypertrophied RV (dRVH) studied animal models. modeled natural history RVH failure monocrotaline rat model pulmonary hypertension serially assessing clinically relevant parameters animal. defined dRVH stage RV systolic pressure started decreasing, along cardiac output, RV continued remodel. dRVH characterized ascites, weight loss, high mortality, compared cRVH. cRVH myocardium hyperpolarized mitochondria low production mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (mROS), activated hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha), increased levels glucose transporter 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, stromal-derived factor 1, promoting increased glucose uptake (measured positron emission tomography-computed tomography) angiogenesis measured lectin imaging vivo. transition dRVH marked sharp rise mROS, inhibition HIF1alpha, activation p53, contributed down-regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase decreased glucose uptake. transition also associated sharp decrease angiogenic factors angiogenesis. show previously described metabolic shift, promoting HIF1alpha activation angiogenesis, sustained progression RV failure. loss beneficial remodeling may triggered rise mROS resulting HIF1alpha inhibition suppressed angiogenesis. resultant ischemia may contribute rapid deterioration RV function upon entrance decompensation phase. use clinical criteria techniques define study dRVH facilitates clinical translation findings direct implications RV therapeutic biomarker discovery programs. KEY MESSAGE: Decreased RV angiogenesis marks transition cRVH dRVH. RVs cRVH animals associated decreased mROS increased HIF1alpha activity compared dRVH. RVs cRVH animals increased GLUT1 levels increased glucose uptake compared dRVH.
