 Nup98 gene codes several alternatively spliced protein precursors. Two vitro translated autoproteolytically cleaved precursors yielded heterodimers Nup98-6kDa peptide Nup98-Nup96. TPR (translocated promoter region) protein forms filamentous structures extending nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) intranuclear sites. found vitro translated TPR bound vitro translated Nup98 and, via Nup98, Nup96. Double-immunofluorescence microscopy antibodies TPR Nup98 showed colocalization. confocal sections nucleolus weakly stained intensive perinucleolar staining. Striking spike-like structures emanated perinucleolar ring attenuated thinner structures extended nuclear periphery. characteristic staining pattern TPR network considerably enhanced myc-tagged pyruvate kinase-6kDa fusion protein overexpressed HeLa cells. Double-immunoelectron microscopy cells using anti-myc anti-TPR antibodies secondary gold-coupled antibodies yielded row-like arrangements gold particles. Taken together, immunolocalization data support previous electron microscopical data, suggesting TPR forms filaments extend NPC nucleolus. discuss possible implications association Nup98 intranuclear TPR network intranuclear phase transport.
