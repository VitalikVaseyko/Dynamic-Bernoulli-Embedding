 Internet become central source information, tools, services facilitating work medicinal chemists drug discoverers worldwide. paper introduce web-based public tool, ChemGPS-NP(Web) (http://chemgps.bmc.uu.se), comprehensive chemical space navigation exploration terms global mapping onto consistent, eight dimensional map structure derived physico-chemical characteristics. ChemGPS-NP(Web) assist compound selection prioritization; property description interpretation; cluster analysis neighbourhood mapping; well comparison characterization large compound datasets. using ChemGPS-NP(Web), researchers analyze compare chemical libraries consistent manner. study demonstrated ChemGPS-NP(Web) assist interpreting results two large datasets tested activity biological assays pyruvate kinase Bcl-2 family related protein interactions, respectively. Furthermore, 30-year-old suggestion "chemical similarity" natural pigments betalains muscaflavins tested.
