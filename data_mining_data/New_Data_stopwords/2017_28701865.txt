 BACKGROUND: Heat-processed ginseng, sun ginseng (SG), reported improved therapeutic properties compared raw forms, increased antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic effects. aim study investigate antiobesity effects SG suppression cell differentiation proliferation mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells lipid accumulation Caenorhabditis elegans. METHODS: investigate effect SG adipocyte differentiation, levels stained intracellular lipid droplets quantified measuring oil red signal lipid extracts cells differentiation Day 7. study effect SG fat accumulation C. elegans, L4 stage worms cultured Escherichia coli OP50 diet supplemented 10 mug/mL SG, followed Nile red staining. determine effect SG gene expression lipid glucose metabolism-regulation molecules, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels genes analyzed real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. addition, phosphorylation Akt examined Western blotting. RESULTS: SG suppressed differentiation 3T3-L1 cells stimulated mixture 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, insulin (MDI), inhibited proliferation adipocytes differentiation. Treatment C. elegans SG showed reductions lipid accumulation Nile red staining, thus directly demonstrating antiobesity effect SG. Furthermore, SG treatment downregulated mRNA protein expression levels peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor subtype gamma (PPARgamma) CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) decreased mRNA level sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c MDI-treated adipocytes dose-dependent manner. differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, mRNA expression levels lipid metabolism-regulating factors, amplifying mouse fatty acid-binding protein 2, leptin, lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid transporter protein 1, fatty acid synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase, increased, whereas lipolytic enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 decreased. data demonstrate SG inversely regulated expression genes differentiated adipocytes. SG induced increases mRNA expression glycolytic enzymes glucokinase pyruvate kinase, decrease mRNA level glycogenic enzyme phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase. addition, mRNA levels glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT4, insulin receptor substrate-1 elevated MDI stimulation, whereas SG dose-dependently inhibited expression genes differentiated adipocytes. SG also inhibited phosphorylation Akt (Ser473) early phase MDI stimulation. Intracellular nitric oxide (NO) production endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels markedly decreased MDI stimulation recovered SG treatment adipocytes. CONCLUSION: results suggest SG effectively inhibits adipocyte proliferation differentiation downregulation PPARgamma C/EBPalpha, suppressing Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation enhancing production. results provide strong evidence support development SG antiobesity treatment.
