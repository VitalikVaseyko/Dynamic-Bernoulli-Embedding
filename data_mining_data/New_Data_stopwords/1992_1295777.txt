 Red blood cell membrane proteins studied group patients hereditary spherocytosis, comparison normal donors, reveal anomalous proteins associated disease. purpose red blood cells patients normal donors fractionated, age, Ficoll-400 gradient, result red blood cell membranes obtained proteins investigated method two-dimensional electrophoresis. comparison two-dimensional electrophoregrams red blood cell membrane proteins normal donors microspherocytosis patients found latters additional peptides area glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate hydrogenase pyruvate kinase. changes detected red blood cell membrane protein composition might caused age shifts red blood cell population disease type.
