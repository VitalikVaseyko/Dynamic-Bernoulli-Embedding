 Endorepellin, angiostatic C-terminal domain heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, inhibits angiogenesis simultaneously binding alpha2beta1 integrin vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) endothelial cells. interaction triggers down-regulation receptors concurrent activation tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, leads signaling cascade resulting angiostasis. Here, provide evidence endorepellin capable attenuating PI3K/PDK1/Akt/mTOR PKC/JNK/AP1 pathways. show hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) transcriptional activity induced VEGFA inhibited endorepellin independent oxygen concentration combination PI3K calcineurin inhibitors completely blocked suppressive activity evoked endorepellin HIF1A VEGFA promoter activity. Moreover, endorepellin inhibited PKC/JNK/AP1 axis induced recruitment phospholipase gamma attenuated VEGFA-induced activation NFAT1, process dependent calcineurin activity. Finally, endorepellin inhibited VEGFA-evoked nuclear translocation NFAT1 promoted NFAT1 stability. Thus, provide evidence novel downstream signaling axis angiostatic fragment key components involved dual antagonistic activity endorepellin, highlighting potential use therapeutic agent.
