 raised specific antibodies rabbits pure alpha alpha- gamma gamma-isoenzymes enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) purified human brain. specifically immunoabsorbed respective Sepharose-coupled enolase isoenzymes, purified antibodies desorbed acidification coated onto polystyrene tubes. sample containing isoenzyme activity determined incubated respective coated tube. coating washed, reaction antibody-bound enzyme initiated adding 2-phosphoglycerate, ADP, pyruvate kinase. accumulation ATP measured following increase light emission firefly luciferase bioluminescence system. assay specific antibody used coating. detection limit 5 X 10(-9) U, corresponding 0.1 pg 10(-18) mol enzyme protein per assay. Activities enolase isoenzymes human plasma evaluated separately, rapidly, precisely. used assay measure enolase isoenzyme activities plasma patients suffering different types malignant tumors.
