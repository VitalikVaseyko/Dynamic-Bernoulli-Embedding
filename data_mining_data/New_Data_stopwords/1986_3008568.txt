 action insulin hepatic glucose production (HGP) studied fed anesthetized rats euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. end clamp, liver rapidly removed, frozen, enzyme activities metabolites measured. insulin totally suppressed HGP, modify glycogen phosphorylase synthase activity, "spare" increase glycogen content. Insulin decreased glucose 6-phosphate increasing glycolytic intermediates (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, alpha-glycerophosphate, lactate, pyruvate) well fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, potent effector 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. Insulin also increased pyruvate kinase activity low substrate concentration. Lipogenesis measured 3H2O incorporation fatty acids increased four-to fivefold insulin. data suggest normal rat liver, glycemia maintained constant basal level, insulin promotes change glycogen metabolism, whereas hormone stimulates glycolytic pathway. action contributes suppression hepatic glucose production observed addition hormone.
