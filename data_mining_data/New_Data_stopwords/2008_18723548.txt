 present study set investigate thermal limits Mediterranean bivalve Modiolus barbatus, acclimated various temperatures, includes comparison laboratory determined limits temperature-dependent restriction deeper water layers natural habitat. Thermal responses limits determined integrating information various levels biological organization, including expression Hsp70 Hsp90, phosphorylation stress-activated protein kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) cJun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs) well metabolic adjustments. latter assessed examining temperature effects activity key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK). expression Hsp70 Hsp90 activated mussels acclimated temperatures 20 degrees C. Increased phosphorylation p38 MAPK JNKs temperatures indicate activation MAPK signaling cascades potential involvement induction Hsp genes. indicated activity PK, Modiolus barbatus maintains aerobic capacity acclimated temperatures 24 degrees C, warming probably caused metabolic depression shift aerobic anaerobic metabolism. increase mortality occurred parallel, acclimation temperatures 24 degrees C. results indicate biochemical stress indicators metabolic status respond parallel hypoxemia becomes extreme. Comparison previous study thermal limits vertical distribution M. galloprovincialis dwelling shallow waters emphasizes relevance maintained aerobic scope passive tolerance permanent vertical zonation higher temperatures field. findings conclusions line concept oxygen capacity limited thermal tolerance associated systemic molecular hierarchy thermal limitation.
