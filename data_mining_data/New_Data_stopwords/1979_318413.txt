 1. effect sustained (48 hr) oxygen depletion tissue (brain, heart, skeletal muscle) pyruvate kinase (PyKi) activities examined pond turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans). 2. PyKi activities skeletal muscle significantly increased (from 322 +/- 84 450 +/- 95) following 48 hr tissue hypoxia. PyKi activities brain may already elevated ambient conditions change following prolonged submersion (334 +/- 75 vs 325 +/- 77). Cardiac muscle PyKi actually decreased (from 135 +/- 35 94 +/- 18) anaerobic conditions. 3. data suggest prolonged O2 depletion may increase PyKi biosynthesis turtle skeletal muscle (subserving enhanced glycolysis), also demonstrate factors oxygen availability involved regulation tissue PyKi activities intact vertebrates.
