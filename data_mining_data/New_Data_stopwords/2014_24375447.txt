 Red blood cell pyruvate kinase (PK-R) key regulatory enzyme red cell metabolism. Hereditary deficiency PK-R caused mutations PKLR gene, leading chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. contrast PK deficiency, inherited PK hyperactivity also described. rare abnormality RBC metabolism documented two families appears without clinical consequences. Thus far, attributed either gain function mutation PKLR persistent expression fetal PK isozyme PK-M2 mature red blood cells. report novel type inherited PK hyperactivity characterized solely increased expression kinetically normal PK-R. line latter, mutations detected PKLR. Mutations regulatory regions well variations PKLR copy number also absent. addition, linkage analysis suggested PK hyperactivity segregated independently PKLR locus. therefore postulate causative mutation resides novel yet-unidentified locus, upregulates PKLR gene expression. mutations locus may involved cases PK deficiency fail reveal mutations PKLR.
