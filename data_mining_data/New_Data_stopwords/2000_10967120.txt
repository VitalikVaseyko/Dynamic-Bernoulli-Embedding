 Mutations HNF4alpha gene associated subtype 1 maturity-onset diabetes young (MODY1), characterized impaired insulin secretory response glucose pancreatic beta-cells. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) transcription factor critical liver development hepatocyte-specific gene expression. However, role HNF4alpha regulation pancreatic beta-cell gene expression correlation metabolism secretion coupling previously investigated. tetracycline-inducible system employed achieve tightly controlled expression wild type (WT) dominant-negative mutant (DN) HNF4alpha INS-1 cells. induction WT-HNF4alpha resulted left shift glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas DN-HNF4alpha selectively impaired nutrient-stimulated insulin release. Induction DN-HNF4alpha also caused defective mitochondrial function substantiated reduced [(14)C]pyruvate oxidation, attenuated substrate-evoked mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, blunted nutrient-generated cellular ATP production. Quantitative evaluation HNF4alpha-regulated pancreatic beta-cell gene expression revealed altered mRNA levels insulin, glucose transporter-2, L-pyruvate kinase, aldolase B, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 subunit, mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2. patterns HNF4alpha-regulated gene expression strikingly similar downstream transcription factor HNF1alpha. Indeed, HNF4alpha changed HNF1alpha mRNA levels HNF1alpha promoter luciferase activity altered HNF4alpha binding. results demonstrate importance HNF4alpha beta-cell metabolism-secretion coupling.
