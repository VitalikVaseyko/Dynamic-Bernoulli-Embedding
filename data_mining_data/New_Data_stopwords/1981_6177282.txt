 Various physiological important activities Mycoplasma gallisepticum inhibited copper(I) complex 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline [Cu(DMP)2NO3]. energy-yielding metabolism inhibited conversion pyruvate lactate found blocked Cu(DMP)2NO3, indicating selective inhibition lactate dehydrogenase. Also, production rate acetate rate oxygen uptake whole cells M. gallisepticum appeared strongly decreased. Experiments crude cell extracts showed inhibition reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase Cu(DMP)2NO3 even stronger inhibition NADH oxidase lactate dehydrogenase CuSO4. preferential inhibition adenosine 5'-triphosphatase pyruvate kinase found. Investigations influence Cu(DMP)2NO3 deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, protein synthesis growing cells M. gallisepticum showed selective inhibition incorporation [14C]thymidine deoxyribonucleic acid. Cu(DMP)2NO3 induced decrease total amount accessible sulfhydryl groups whole cells M. gallisepticum, indicating observed diverse toxicity Cu(DMP)2NO3 may associated interaction copper ions protein sulfhydryl groups.
