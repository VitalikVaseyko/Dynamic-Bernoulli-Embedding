 Comparison genomes free-living Bodo saltans parasitic trypanosomatids reveals transition free-living parasitic life style resulted loss approximately 50% protein-coding genes. Despite dramatic reduction genome size, B. saltans trypanosomatids still share significant number common metabolic traits: glycosomes; unique set pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway genes; ATP-PFK homologous bacterial PPi -PFKs rather canonical eukaryotic ATP-PFKs; alternative oxidase; three phosphoglycerate kinases two GAPDH isoenzymes; pyruvate kinase regulated fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; trypanothione substitute glutathione; synthesis fatty acids via unique set elongase enzymes; mitochondrial acetate:succinate coenzyme transferase. B. saltans lost capacity synthesize ubiquinone. Among genes present B. saltans lost trypanosomatids involved degradation mureine, tryptophan lysine. Novel acquisitions trypanosomatids components pentose sugar metabolism, pteridine reductase bromodomain-factor proteins. addition, subfamily Leishmaniinae acquired gene catalase capacity convert diaminopimelic acid lysine.
