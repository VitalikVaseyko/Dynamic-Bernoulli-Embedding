 Cells Picrophilus torridus, grown glucose, contained enzyme activities non-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway, including glucose dehydrogenase, gluconate dehydratase, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase, glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GADH), glycerate kinase (2-phosphoglycerate forming), enolase pyruvate kinase. GADH purified homogeneity. 115-kDa homodimeric protein catalyzed oxidation glyceraldehyde NADP+ highest catalytic efficiency. NAD+ used. MALDI-TOF analysis, open reading frame (ORF) Pto0332 identified genome P. torridus encoding gene, designated gadh, recombinant GADH characterized. Thermoplasma acidophilum ORF Ta0809 represents gadh homolog highest sequence identity; gene expressed recombinant protein characterized functional GADH properties similar P. torridus enzyme. Sequence comparison phylogenetic analysis define GADHs members novel enzyme family within aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily.
