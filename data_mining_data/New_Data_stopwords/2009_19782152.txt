 Evolving evidence suggest metabolic requirements cell proliferation identical normal cancer cells. HER2 oncogene-overexpressors, highly aggressive subtype human cancer cells, constitute one best examples malignant cells maximize ability acquire metabolize nutrients manner conductive proliferation rather efficient ATP production. HER2-overexpressors optimize requirements rapid cancer cell growth fine-tuning double [lipogenic/lipolytic]-edged metabolic sword. one edge, HER2 oncogene overexpression triggers redundant signaling cascades ensure major enzymes involved de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis facilitate aerobic glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation energy production (Warburg effect). HER2 also establishes positive bidirectional relationship key lipogenic enzyme Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) rapidly senses respond disturbance flux lipogenic substrates (e.g. NADPH acetyl-CoA) lipogenesis end-products (i.e. palmitate). edge, HER2 overexpression arranges detoxifying mechanisms upregulating PPARgamma, well established positive regulator role adipogenesis lipid storage cell types active lipid metabolism. PPARgamma establishes lipogenesis/lipolysis joining-point enables HER2-positive cancer cells avoid endogenous palmitate toxicity securing palmitate fat stores avoid palmitate feedback FASN functioning. ability HER2 supercharge lipogenesis (by activating regulatory circuits activate fuel lipogenic enzyme FASN) averting lipotoxicity (by promoting conversion storage excess FAs triglycerides PPARgamma-dependent manner) supports notion best adapted cancer phenotypes addicted oncogenic lipid metabolism cell proliferation survival. conceptually attractive assume crash HER2-driven rapid cell proliferation inhibiting "motor refueling" (upon blockade lipogenic enzymes), losing "lipolytic brake" (upon blockade PPARgamma) and/or sticking "lipogenic gas pedal" (upon supplementation dietary FAs).
