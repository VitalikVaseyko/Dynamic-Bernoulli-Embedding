 Periprosthetic osteolysis leading asceptic loosening remains primary cause failure joint replacement. Although many inflammatory cell types implicated, exact pathomechanisms asceptic loosening delineated. present study adopted proteomic approach elucidate initial signals expressed particulate material, using vitro cell culture system. Human lung fibroblasts MRC-5 cultured Cobalt Chromium (CoCr ASTM F-75, 1-7 microm) particles. Cells harvested 72 h incubation total cellular proteins extracted downstream analysis via 2D Gel Electrophoresis tandem mass spectrometry using MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS. Thirteen protein spots showed greater twofold increase, following 72 h incubation fibroblast CoCr particles. Four proteins identified tandem mass spectrometry. Annexin II, Pyruvate kinase, Triose phosphate isomerase, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 protein. Cobalt hypoxia mimicking agent N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 protein, Triose phosphate isomerase, Pyruvate kinase, Annexin II important hypoxia regulated gene products found expressed cellular oxidative stress response. data indicates exposure fibroblast CoCr alloy induces transition cells hypoxia like state oxidative stress even normoxic culture conditions. study reflects possibility presence hypoxic environment periprosthetic tissue surrounding metallic implants.
