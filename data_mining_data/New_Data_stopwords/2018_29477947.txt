 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate improves contractility normal, hypoxic, post-ischemic myocardium. However, sodium overload major problem therapeutic application sodium pyruvate used. Development alternative forms N-1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) pyruvate may help overcome problem. aim study investigate effect MNA pyruvate murine model cardiac ischemia. METHODS: Seven month old male ApoE(-/-)LDLr(-/-) mice develop myocardial infarction exposed hypoxic stress, used study. Hypoxia (8% O2 inspired air) maintained 8min followed reoxygenation (21% O2 inspired air). Four groups mice treated 10min hypoxic event intravenous injection MNA, MNA pyruvate, sodium pyruvate, saline control. myocardial ischemia damage recorded ECG. Four hours following hypoxic episode serum troponin creatine kinase activity measured. RESULTS: Significant hypernatremia found sodium pyruvate group. hypoxia, control MNA group developed profound STU depressions ECG changes observed MNA pyruvate sodium pyruvate group. Creatine kinase activity troponin content mice plasma significantly higher control MNA group compared MNA pyruvate sodium pyruvate group. CONCLUSIONS: study demonstrated administration MNA pyruvate prior hypoxia-induced cardiac event cardioprotective. intervention cause hypernatremia contrast sodium pyruvate.
