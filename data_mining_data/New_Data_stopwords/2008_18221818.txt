 Curcumin compound derived spice turmeric, potent anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogenic, anti-hepatotoxic agent. investigated acute effects curcumin hepatic glucose production. Gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis isolated hepatocytes, gluconeogenetic enzyme activity 120 min exposure curcumin measured. Hepatic gluconeogenesis 1 mM pyruvate inhibited concentration-dependent manner, maximal decrease 45% concentration 25 microM. 120 min exposure 25 microM curcumin, hepatic gluconeogenesis 2mM dihydroxyacetone phosphate hepatic glycogenolysis inhibited 35% 20%, respectively. Insulin also inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis 1mM pyruvate inhibited hepatic glycogenolysis concentration-dependent manner. Curcumin (25 microM) showed additive inhibitory effect insulin hepatic gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis, indicating curcumin inhibits hepatic glucose production insulin-independent manner. 120 min exposure 25 microM curcumin, hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity inhibited 30%, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) reduced. 120 min exposure 25 microM curcumin, phosphorylation AMP kinase alpha-Thr(172) increased. Thus, anti-diabetic effects curcumin partly due reduction hepatic glucose production caused activation AMP kinase inhibition G6Pase activity PEPCK activity.
