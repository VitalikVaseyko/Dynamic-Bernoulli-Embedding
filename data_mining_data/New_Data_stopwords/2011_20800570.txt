 ATP synthase Escherichia coli isolated reconstituted liposomes. ATP hydrolysis proteoliposomes coupled proton pumping, ensuing inner volume acidification measured fluorescent probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA). ACMA response calibrated acid-base transitions, converted internal pH values. rates internal acidification ATP hydrolysis measured parallel, function P(i) ADP concentration. Increasing P(i) monotonically inhibited hydrolysis rate half-maximal effect 510muM, whereas stimulated acidification rate 100-200muM, inhibiting higher concentrations. ADP concentration assay, due contaminant ADP ATP hydrolysis reaction, progressively decreased means increasing pyruvate kinase activities. Decreasing ADP stimulated hydrolysis rate, whereas inhibited internal acidification rate. quantitative analysis showed relative number translocated protons per hydrolyzed ATP, i.e. relative coupling ratio, depended concentrations P(i) ADP apparent K(d) values 220muM 27nM respectively. smallest ADP concentrations reached, absence P(i), coupling ratio dropped 15% relative value observed highest ADP P(i) concentrations tested. addition, data indicate presence two ADP P(i) binding sites, highest affinity one related changes coupling ratio.
