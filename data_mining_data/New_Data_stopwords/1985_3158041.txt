 decreased intracellular pH exocrine glands could important factor pathogenesis cystic fibrosis. Metabolic acidosis induced rats adding ammonium chloride drinking water. increased content total proteins glycoproteins found submandibular glands treated animals. activities glycolytic enzymes - hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase - also increased glands, whereas activity creatine phosphokinase unchanged. changes protein concentration enzyme activities submandibular gland acidotic rats agree findings patients cystic fibrosis cultured fibroblasts patients. acidotic rat might new promising animal model cystic fibrosis research. finding increased enzyme activities acidotic rats is, however, contrary findings animal models disease.
