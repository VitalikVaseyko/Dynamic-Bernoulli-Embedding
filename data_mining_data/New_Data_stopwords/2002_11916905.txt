 humans, skeletal muscle major site peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) expression, function tissue unclear. investigated role hPPAR-alpha regulating muscle lipid utilization studying effects highly selective PPAR-alpha agonist, GW7647, [(14)C]oleate metabolism gene expression primary human skeletal muscle cells. Robust induction PPAR-alpha protein expression occurred muscle cell differentiation corresponded differentiation-dependent increases oleate oxidation. mature myotubes, 48-h treatment 10-1,000 nmol/l GW7647 increased oleate oxidation dose-dependently, threefold. Additionally, GW7647 decreased oleate esterification myotube triacylglycerol (TAG), 45%. effect abolished etomoxir, potent inhibitor beta-oxidation, indicating PPAR-alpha-mediated TAG depletion depend reciprocal changes fatty acid catabolism. Consistent metabolic actions, GW7647 induced mRNA expression mitochondrial enzymes promote fatty acid catabolism; carnitine palmityltransferase 1 malonyl-CoA decarboxylase increased approximately 2-fold, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 increased 45-fold. Expression several genes regulate glycerolipid synthesis changed GW7647 treatment, implicating involvement targets explain TAG-depleting effect compound. results demonstrate role hPPAR-alpha regulating muscle lipid homeostasis.
