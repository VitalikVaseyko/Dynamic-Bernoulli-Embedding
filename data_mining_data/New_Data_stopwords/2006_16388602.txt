 Cyclophilins implicated several important cellular functions. earlier results showed reactivation adenosine kinase (AdK) CyP (LdCyP) parasitic protozoa Leishmania donovani accompanied disaggregation enzyme [Chakraborty, A., et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 47451-47460; Chakraborty, A., et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 11862-11872]. However, remained known enzyme displayed progressive inhibition time-dependent reaction LdCyP prevent and/or reverse inhibition. Herein, demonstrate one reaction products, ADP AMP, facilitates formation AdK aggregates, leading inactivation. studies revealed LdCyP reactivates enzyme withdrawing ADP inhibition. investigate molecular mechanism, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence polarization AdK monitored presence either LdCyP ADP combination thereof. Whereas presence LdCyP tryptophan fluorescence emission maxima AdK exhibited red shift, ADP quenching effect. However, red shift quenching became less noticeable one (W234) two tryptophan residues AdK altered, indicating W234 fluorescence relatively sensitive LdCyP ADP binding. Kinetic measurements indicated LdCyP-facilitated reactivation AdK accompanied concomitant increase KD ADP AMP. Interestingly, addition myokinase (MK) pyruvate kinase (PK) along phosphoenolpyruvate, either singly conjunction, AdK reaction mixture led reactivation. effect PK MK could substituted CyP vice versa. Taken together, results suggest LdCyP-induced reactivation occurs due conformational reorientation AdK manner decreases affinity enzyme ADP consequent relief ADP-mediated aggregation.
