 attempt restore pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), expression vectors carrying wildtype E1 alpha cDNA (pRAWT) 1162ins-mutant (pRA1162) introduced human lymphoblastoid cells 4-bp insertion nucleotide 1162 (1162ins) E1 alpha cDNA, 28% normal PDHC activity, undetectable levels E1 alpha E1 beta proteins. amount E1 alpha mRNA transcribed introduced cDNA approximately 25 times greater transcribed endogenous gene. PDHC activity pRAWT-transformed cells increased normal level whereas activity increased 55% control pRA1162-transformed cells. Mitochondria pRAWT-transformed cells contained normal amounts E1 alpha E1 beta subunits. results suggest three C-terminal amino acids E1 alpha, absent 1162ins-mutant protein, may important structural integrity E1 large amount normal subunit, compared endogenous mutant enzyme, must expressed restore multienzyme complex.
