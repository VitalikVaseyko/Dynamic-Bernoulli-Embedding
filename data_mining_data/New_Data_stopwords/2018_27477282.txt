 Deregulated cathepsin proteolysis occurs across numerous cancers, vivo substrates mediating tumorigenesis remain ill-defined. Applying 8-plex iTRAQ terminal amine isotopic labeling substrates (TAILS), systems-level N-terminome degradomics approach, identified cathepsin B, H, L, S, Z vivo substrates cleavage sites use six different cathepsin knockout genotypes Rip1-Tag2 mouse model pancreatic neuroendocrine tumorigenesis. Among 1,935 proteins 1,114 N termini identified TAILS, stable proteolytic products identified wild-type tumors compared one different cathepsin knockouts (17%-44% 139 cleavages). suggests lack compensation substrate level cathepsins. majority neo-N termini (56%-83%) cathepsins consistent protein degradation. validated substrates, including glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 associated Warburg effect, ER chaperone GRP78, oncoprotein prothymosin-alpha. Thus, identification cathepsin substrates tumorigenesis improves understanding cathepsin functions normal physiology cancer.
