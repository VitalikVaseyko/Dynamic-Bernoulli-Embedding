 O-linked-beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification regulatory, nuclear cytoplasmic post-translational glycosylation proteins associated age-related diseases Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type II diabetes. Global elevation O-GlcNAc levels intracellular proteins induce insulin resistance, hallmark type II diabetes, mammalian systems. InC. elegans, attenuation insulin-like signal transduction pathway increases adult lifespan nematode. demonstrate O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes OGT OGA, add remove O-GlcNAc respectively, modulate lifespan C. elegans. Median adult lifespan increased oga-1 deletion strain median adult life span decreased upon ogt-1 deletion. O-GlcNAc-mediated effect nematode lifespan dependent FoxO transcription factor DAF-16. DAF-16 key factor insulin-like signal transduction pathway regulate reproductive development, lifespan, stress tolerance, dauer formation C. elegans. data indicates O-GlcNAc cycling selectively influences subset DAF-16 mediated phenotypes, including lifespan oxidative stress resistance. performed affinity purification O-GlcNAc-modified proteins observed high percentage proteins regulated insulin signaling and/or impact insulin pathway functional outcomes, suggesting O-GlcNAc modification may control downstream effectors modulate insulin pathway mediated cellular processes.
