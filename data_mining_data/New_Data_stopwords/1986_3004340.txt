 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase exists interconvertible active inactive forms cultured fibroblasts normal familial hypercholesterolemic subjects. inactive form activated endogenous added phosphoprotein phosphatase. Active partially active HMG-CoA reductase cell extracts inactivated ATP-Mg-dependent reductase kinase. Incubation phosphorylated (inactive) HMG-CoA reductase purified phosphoprotein phosphatase associated dephosphorylation (reactivation) complete restoration HMG-CoA reductase activity. Low density lipoprotein, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, mevalonolactone suppressed HMG-CoA reductase activity short-term mechanism involving reversible phosphorylation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol, enters cells without requirement low density lipoprotein-receptor binding, inhibited HMG-CoA reductase activity familial hypercholesterolemic cells reversible phosphorylation. Measurement short-term effects inhibitors rate cholesterol synthesis radiolabeled acetate revealed HMG-CoA reductase phosphorylation responsible rapid suppression sterol synthesis. Reductase kinase activity cultured fibroblasts also affected reversible phosphorylation. active (phosphorylated) reductase kinase inactivated dephosphorylation phosphatase. Inactive reductase kinase reactivated phosphorylation ATP-Mg second protein kinase rat liver, designated reductase kinase kinase. Reductase kinase kinase activity shown present extracts cultured fibroblasts. combined results represent initial demonstration short-term regulation HMG-CoA reductase activity cholesterol synthesis normal receptor-negative cultured fibroblasts involving reversible phosphorylation HMG-CoA reductase reductase kinase.
