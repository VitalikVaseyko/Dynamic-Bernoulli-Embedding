 Hepatic gene expression P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) regulated response changes availability substrates, particular glucose (Glc; Massillon, D., Barzilai, N., Chen, W., Hu, M., Rossetti, L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9871-9874). investigated mechanism(s) conscious rats. Hyperglycemia per se caused rapid marked increase Glc-6-Pase mRNA abundance protein levels. contrast, hyperglycemia decreased abundance PEPCK mRNA. Importantly, inhibition glucokinase activity glucosamine infusion blunted stimulation Glc-6-Pase inhibition PEPCK gene expression Glc, suggesting intrahepatic signal (metabolite) generated metabolism glucose beyond Glc-6-P responsible regulatory effect Glc. effect Glc L-type pyruvate kinase gene mediated xylulose-5-P (Doiron, B., Cuif, M., Chen, R., Kahn, A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 5321-5324). Thus, next investigated whether isolated increase hepatic concentration metabolite also reproduce effects Glc Glc-6-Pase PEPCK gene expression vivo. Xylitol, directly converted xylulose-5-P liver, infused raise hepatic concentration xylulose-5-P approximately 3-fold. Xylitol infusion alter levels Glc-6-P fructose-2,6-biphosphate. However, replicated effects hyperglycemia Glc-6-Pase PEPCK gene expression resulted 75% increase vivo flux Glc-6-Pase (total glucose output).
