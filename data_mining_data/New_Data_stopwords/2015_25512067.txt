 BACKGROUND: Yeast cells developed variety mechanisms regulate activity metabolic enzymes order adjust metabolism response genetic environmental perturbations. achieved massive reprogramming gene expression. However, transcriptional response cannot explain complexity metabolic regulation, mRNA stability regulation, non-covalent binding allosteric effectors post-translational modifications enzymes (such phosphorylation, acetylation ubiquitination) also involved, especially short term responses, converging modulating enzyme activity. SCOPE REVIEW: functional significance post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulation central carbon metabolism subject review. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: genome wide analysis PTMs indicates several metabolic enzymes subjected multiple PTMs, suggesting yeast cells use different modifications and/or combinations specifically respond environmental changes. Glycolysis fermentation pathways phosphorylation, acetylation ubiquitination frequent, enzymes storage carbohydrate metabolism especially phosphorylated. Interestingly, enzymes, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase Pfk26, phosphofructokinases Pfk1 Pfk2 pyruvate kinase Cdc19, hubs PTMs, thus representing central key regulation nodes. functionally better characterized enzymes, role phosphorylations lysine modifications discussed. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: review focuses regulatory mechanisms yeast carbon metabolism, highlighting requirement quantitative, systematical studies better understand PTM contribution metabolic regulation.
