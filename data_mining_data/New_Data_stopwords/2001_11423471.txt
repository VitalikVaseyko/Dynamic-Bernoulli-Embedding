 Mutations HNF4alpha gene responsible type 1 maturity-onset diabetes young (MODY1), characterized defect insulin secretion. Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha transcription factor plays critical role transcriptional regulation genes involved glucose metabolism hepatocytes pancreatic beta-cells. Recent evidence implicated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) modulation insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells control glucose-dependent gene expression hepatocytes beta-cells. Therefore, question could raised whether AMPK plays role processes modulating HNF-4alpha function. study, show activation AMPK 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR) hepatocytes greatly diminished HNF-4alpha protein levels consequently downregulates expression HNF-4alpha target genes. Quantitative evaluation HNF-4alpha target gene expression revealed diminished mRNA levels HNF-1alpha, GLUT2, L-type pyruvate kinase, aldolase B, apolipoprotein (apo)-B, apoCIII. data clearly demonstrate MODY1/HNF-4alpha transcription factor novel target AMPK hepatocytes. Accordingly, suggested pancreatic beta-cells, AMPK also acts decreasing HNF-4alpha protein level, therefore insulin secretion. Hence, possible role AMPK physiopathology type 2 diabetes considered.
