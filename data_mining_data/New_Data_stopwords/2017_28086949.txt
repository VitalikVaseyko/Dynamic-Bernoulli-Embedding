 BACKGROUND: Aerobic glycolysis, hallmark cancer, characterized increased metabolism glucose production lactate normaxia. Recently, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) identified key player regulating aerobic glycolysis promoting tumor cell proliferation survival. METHODS: Tandem affinity purification followed mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) used study interaction NIMA (never mitosis gene A)-related kinase 2 (NEK2) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) A1/2. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) performed identify NEK2 binding PKM pre-mRNA sequence. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR performed analyze transcriptional regulation NEK2 c-Myc. Western blot real-time PCR executed analyze regulation PKM2 NEK2. RESULTS: NEK2 regulates alternative splicing PKM immature RNA multiple myeloma cells interacting hnRNPA1/2. RIP shows NEK2 binds intronic sequence flanking exon 9 PKM pre-mRNA. Knockdown NEK2 decreases ratio PKM2/PKM1 also aerobic glycolysis genes including GLUT4, HK2, ENO1, LDHA, MCT4. Myeloma patients high expression NEK2 PKM2 lower event-free survival overall survival. data indicate NEK2 transcriptionally regulated c-Myc myeloma cells. Ectopic expression NEK2 partially rescues growth inhibition cell death induced silenced c-Myc. CONCLUSIONS: studies demonstrate NEK2 promotes aerobic glycolysis regulating splicing PKM increasing PKM2/PKM1 ratio myeloma cells contributes oncogenic activity.
