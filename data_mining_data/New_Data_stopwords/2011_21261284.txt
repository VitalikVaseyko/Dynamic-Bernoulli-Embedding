 binding site allosteric inhibitor (amino acid) highly conserved human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) rabbit muscle isozyme (rM(1)-PYK). detail similarities/differences allosteric function two homologues, quantified binding 45 amino acid analogues hL-PYK allosteric impact affinity substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). complements similar study previously completed rM(1)-PYK. hL-PYK, minimum chemical requirements effector binding identified rM(1)-PYK (i.e., l-2-aminopropanaldehyde substructure effector primarily responsible binding). However, different regions effector determine magnitude allosteric response hL-PYK vs rM(1)-PYK. finding inconsistent idea allosteric pathways conserved homologues protein family.
