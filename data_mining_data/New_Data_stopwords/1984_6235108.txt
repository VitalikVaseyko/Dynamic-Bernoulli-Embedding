 order study effect insulin epidermal growth factor (EGF) glycolysis quiescent 3T3 fibroblasts mechanisms action, lactic acid produced cells activities key glycolytic enzymes cell extracts determined. Insulin increased lactic acid production; maximal stimulation occurred concentrations 250 ng/ml half-maximal dose 50 ng/ml. effect insulin appeared early one hour, lactic acid production presence insulin linearly increased 4 h. 24-h pretreatment insulin exhibited significant effect production cells afterward incubated either without insulin. Lactic acid production decreased concentration phloridzin increased. However, insulin stimulation production still remained presence phloridzin. Parahydroxymercuribenzoate reduced production equivalent increase due insulin. EGF also increased lactic acid production; effect occurred 1 ng/ml maximal 100 ng/ml. activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase quiescent cells increased insulin, affinities substrates enzymes remained unaltered. findings suggest glucose uptake rate-limiting step glycolysis quiescent 3T3 fibroblasts stimulatory effect insulin glycolysis mediated enhanced glucose entry.
