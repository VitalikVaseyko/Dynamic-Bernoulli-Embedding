 mechanisms underlying increased cardioprotection younger female mice unclear. hypothesized serine-threonine protein kinase (protein kinase B; Akt) triggers metabolic gene switch (decreased fatty acids, increased glucose) female hearts enhance mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, conferring protection oxidative stress. Here, employed male female control (db/+) obese (db/db) mice. found diminished transcript levels peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, muscle-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 female control hearts versus male hearts. Moreover, females displayed improved recovery cardiac mitochondrial respiratory function higher ATP levels versus males response acute oxygen deprivation. changes reversed female db/db hearts. However, found significant gender-based differences levels Akt, suggesting Akt-independent signaling mechanisms responsible resilient mitochondrial phenotype observed female mouse hearts. glucose energetically efficient fuel substrate oxygen limiting, gene program may crucial component enhances tolerance oxygen deprivation female hearts.
