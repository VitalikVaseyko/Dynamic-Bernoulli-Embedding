 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) aggressive incurable disease. Poor prognosis due multiple reasons, including acquisition resistance gemcitabine, first-line chemotherapeutic approach. Thus, strong need novel therapies, targeting directly molecular aberrations disease. found chronic exposure PDAC cells gemcitabine selected subpopulation cells drug-resistant (DR-PDAC cells). Importantly, alternative splicing (AS) pyruvate kinase gene (PKM) differentially modulated DR-PDAC cells, resulting promotion cancer-related PKM2 isoform, whose high expression also correlated shorter recurrence-free survival PDAC patients. Switching PKM splicing antisense oligonucleotides favor alternative PKM1 variant rescued sensitivity DR-PDAC cells gemcitabine cisplatin, suggesting PKM2 expression required withstand drug-induced genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, upregulation polypyrimidine-tract binding protein (PTBP1), key modulator PKM splicing, correlated PKM2 expression DR-PDAC cell lines. PTBP1 recruited efficiently PKM pre-mRNA DR- parental PDAC cells. Accordingly, knockdown PTBP1 DR-PDAC cells reduced recruitment PKM pre-mRNA, promoted splicing PKM1 variant abolished drug resistance. Thus, chronic exposure gemcitabine leads upregulation PTBP1 modulation PKM PDAC cells, conferring resistance drug. findings point PKM2 PTBP1 new potential therapeutic targets improve response PDAC chemotherapy.
