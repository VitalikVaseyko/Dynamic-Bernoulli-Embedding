 effect cyclic-AMP-dependent phosphorylation activity isolated pig liver pyruvate kinase studied. found major kinetic effect phosphorylation reduce affinity substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, K0.5 substrate increasing 0.3 0.9 mM upon phosphorylation. cooperative effect phosphoenolpyruvate enhanced, Hill constant nH increasing concomitantly 1.1 1.5. V unaltered. change activity occurred parallel phosphate incorporation, except initial part reaction, inactivation correspondingly slower. affinity second substrate ADP unchanged, apparent Km 0.3 mM saturating concentration phosphoenolpyruvate. Likewise, requirement potassium unaffected, whereas phosphoenzyme required higher concentration magnesium ions maximal activity, compared control enzyme. inhibitory effect phosphorylation counteracted positive effectors, fructose 1,6-biphosphate micromolar concentrations completely activated phosphoenzyme, resulting enzyme properties similar fructose 1,6-biphosphate-activated unphosphorylated enzyme, K0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate 0.025 mM Hill constant 1.1. Hydrogen ions also effective activating phosphoenzyme. Thus, pH lowered 8 6.5 inhibition due phosphorylation abolished. phosphoenzyme sensitive inhibition negative effectors ATP alanine. 2 mM ATP increased K0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate 1.5 mM nH 2.3. corresponding values alanine 1.3 mM 1.9. Phosphorylation thought additional mechanism inhibition enzyme gluconeogenetic conditions.
