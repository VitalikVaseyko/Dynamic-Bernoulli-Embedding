 Renal cell carcinoma comprises 2 3% malignancies adults prevalent subtype clear-cell RCC (ccRCC). type cancer well characterized genomic transcriptomic level associated loss VHL results stabilization HIF1. current study focused evaluating ccRCC stage dependent changes proteome level provide insight molecular pathogenesis ccRCC progression. accomplish this, label-free proteomics used characterize matched tumor normal-adjacent tissues 84 patients stage IV ccRCC. Using pooled samples 1551 proteins identified, 290 differentially abundant, 783 proteins identified using individual samples, 344 differentially abundant. 344 differentially abundant proteins enriched metabolic pathways examination revealed metabolic dysfunction consistent Warburg effect. Additionally, protein data indicated activation ESRRA ESRRG, HIF1A, well inhibition FOXA1, MAPK1 WISP2. subset analysis complementary gene expression array data 47 pairs tissues indicated similar upstream changes, increased HIF1A activation stage, though ESRRA ESRRG activation FOXA1 inhibition predicted transcriptomic data. activation ESRRA ESRRG implied HIF2A may also activated later stages ccRCC, confirmed transcriptional analysis. combined analysis highlights importance HIF1A HIF2A developing ccRCC molecular phenotype well potential involvement ESRRA ESRRG driving changes. addition, cofilin-1, profilin-1, nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase identified candidate markers late stage ccRCC. Utilization data collected heterogeneous biological domains strengthened findings domain, demonstrating complementary nature analysis. Together results highlight importance VHL/HIF1A/HIF2A axis provide foundation therapeutic targets future studies.
