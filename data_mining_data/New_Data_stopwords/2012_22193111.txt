 Dysregulated glucose metabolism energy deficit characteristic severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) mechanism remains fully elucidated. Phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) rate-limiting mitochondria enzyme reaction coupling glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle. Phosphorylation PDH E1alpha1 subunit catalyzed PDH kinase (PDK) inhibits PDH activity, effectively decoupling aerobic glycolysis whereas dephosphorylation phosphorylated PDHE1alpha1 PDH phosphatase (PDP) restores PDH activity. recently reported altered expression phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) following TBI. However, little known PDK PDP involvement. determined PDK (PDK1-4) PDP isoenzyme (PDP1-2) mRNA protein expression rat brain using immunohistochemistry situ hybridization techniques. also quantified PDK PDP mRNA protein levels rat brain following TBI using quantitative real-time PCR Western blot, respectively. Controlled cortical impact-induced TBI (CCI-TBI) craniotomy significantly enhanced PDK1-2 isoenzyme mRNA expression level significantly suppressed PDP1 PDK4 mRNA expression injury (4h 7days). CCI-TBI craniotomy also significantly increased PDK1-4 isoenzyme protein expression suppressed PDP1-2 protein expression rat brain. summary, divergent changes PDK PDP expression indicate imbalance PDK PDP activities would favor increased PDHE1alpha1 phosphorylation enzyme inhibition contributing impaired oxidative glucose metabolism TBI well craniotomy.
