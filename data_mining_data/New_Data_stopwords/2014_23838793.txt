 study elucidated importance two critical enzymes regulation butanol production Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Overexpression 6-phosphofructokinase (pfkA) pyruvate kinase (pykA) genes increased intracellular concentrations ATP NADH also resistance butanol toxicity. Marked increases butanol ethanol production, acetone, also observed batch fermentation. butanol ethanol concentrations 29.4 85.5 % higher, respectively, fermentation double-overexpressed C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824/pfkA+pykA wild-type strain. Furthermore, fed-batch fermentation using glucose carried out, butanol total solvent (acetone, butanol, ethanol) concentrations reached high 19.12 28.02 g/L, respectively. reason improved butanol formation attributed enhanced NADH ATP concentrations increased tolerance butanol double-overexpressed strain.
