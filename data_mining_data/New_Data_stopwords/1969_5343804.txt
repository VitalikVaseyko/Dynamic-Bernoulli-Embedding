 1. activities four enzymes glycolysis assayed liver five different strains rats (four ;Wistar-derived', one Sprague-Dawley) kept three different similar diets. 2. Major strain differences found activities pyruvate kinase (3-fold), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (5-fold), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (3-fold) triokinase (1.5-fold). 3. Although initial activities pyruvate kinase differed greatly percentage responses starvation diet high soluble carbohydrate order two strains. 4. importance considering strain differences emphasized making comparisons measurements carried different laboratories.
