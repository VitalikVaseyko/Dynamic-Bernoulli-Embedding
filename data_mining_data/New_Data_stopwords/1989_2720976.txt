 kinetic assay measuring K+ serum, based activation pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) K+. eliminated interference Na+ NH4+ ions, also activate enzyme, including Na+-binding NH4+-consuming reagents reaction mixture. assay developed evaluated Cobas Fara centrifugal analyzer (and used kinetic analyzers). Within-run between-run CVs less 1.4% less 1.6%, respectively. reaction rate per millimole K+ per liter (0.05 delta A/min) double reagent blank (0.02 delta A/min). Results correlated well flame photometry, interference bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipids, heparin, cations negligible. method, conjunction previous method reported beta-galactosidase used measuring Na+ serum, offers practical alternative use ion-selective electrodes flame photometry measuring clinically important monovalent cations high-throughput "stat" biochemical analyzers.
