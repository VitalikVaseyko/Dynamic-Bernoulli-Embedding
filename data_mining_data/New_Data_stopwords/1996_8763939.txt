 Bacteriophage T4 encodes nearly enzymes synthesizing DNA precursors. exception nucleoside diphosphokinase (ndk gene product), catalyzes synthesis ribonucleoside triphosphates deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) corresponding diphosphates. Surprisingly, Escherichia coli ndk deletion strain grows normally supports T4 infection. shown elsewhere, ndk mutant cells display mutator phenotype deoxyribonucleotide pool abnormalities. However, T4 infection, dNTP pools spontaneous mutation frequencies near normal. E. coli strain carrying deletions ndk pyrA pyrF, structural genes pyruvate kinases, also grows supports T4 infection. examined anaerobic E. coli cultures reports anaerobiosis, pyruvate kinase represents major route nucleoside triphosphate synthesis absence nucleoside diphosphokinase. dNTP pool imbalances mutator phenotype less pronounced anaerobic corresponding aerobic ndk mutant strains. Anaerobic dNTP pool data, reported before, reveal disproportionate reduction dGTP, relative pools, aerobic anaerobic conditions compared. finding mutagenesis pool imbalances mitigated anaerobic T4-infected cultures provides strong, circumstantial, evidence mutator phenotype ndk mutant cells result dNTP imbalance. Also, viability cells indicates existence second enzyme system addition nucleoside diphosphokinase nucleoside triphosphate synthesis.
