 current study showed daily oral treatment fenugreek steroids, designated F(steroids), diabetic rats 30 days demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) decrease blood glucose level considerable increase area insulin-immunoreactive beta-cells diabetic rats. Interestingly, study showed F(steroids) potentially unregulated key steroidogenesis enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), malic enzyme, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) activities cholesterol rate testis, considerably enhanced testosterone estradiol levels plasma surviving diabetic rats. interestingly, F(steroids) obviously prevented alteration key carbohydrate enzymes hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities well testicular glycogen seminal fructose contents surviving diabetic rats. Furthermore, F(steroids) administration surviving diabetic rats significantly decreased sperm shape abnormality improved sperm count. all, potential protective action reproductive systems approved histological study testis epididymis.
