 aim investigation see histological diagnosis brain tumors showing intermediate degree malignancy improved measurement L-alpha-alanine inhibition pyruvate kinase isoenzymes. inhibition pyruvate kinase activity measured 51 gliomas different grades malignancy. confirmed benign tumors low level inhibition (less 50%) malignant tumor, higher level inhibition became, reaching 75%. However, grade II III astrocytomas grade II III oligodendrogliomas analyzed, level inhibition found variable. Grade II showed low moderate levels inhibition grade III moderate high levels. turn, inhibition levels ranging 50 75% found brain tumors intermediate grade malignancy, also number benign malignant tumors. survival times patients brain tumors compared histological diagnosis pyruvate kinase inhibition, prediction survival time basis low high levels inhibition correlated well histological diagnosis. contrast, moderate levels inhibition measured, prediction patients' survival remained uncertain improvement found prediction tumors showing intermediate degree malignancy basis histology.
