 pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) variant inhibited L-cysteine found Ehrlich ascites tumour Morris hepatoma 7777, normal mouse rat livers used comparison. Chromatin extracts materials studied contained three pyruvate kinase isoenzymes (alpha, beta, gamma) showed greatest electrophoretic mobility normal mouse rat livers. isoenzyme mobility diminished tumour chromatin extracts, slow migrating gamma isoenzyme exhibited sensitivity L-cysteine inhibition. gamma isoenzyme sensitive L-cysteine might considered tumour marker. tumour pyruvate kinase isoenzymes insensitive normal signal molecules, i.e., ATP fructose 1,6-diphosphate, regulate liver pyruvate kinase activity. was, however, noted binding pyruvate kinase isoenzymes DNA connected diminution catalytic activity.
