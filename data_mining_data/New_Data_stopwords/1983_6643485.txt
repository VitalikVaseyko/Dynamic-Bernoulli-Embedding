 Control gluconeogenesis lactate studied titrating rat liver cells lactate pyruvate ratio 10:1 perifusion system. different steady states glucose formation, concentration key gluconeogenic intermediates measured plotted gluconeogenic flux (J glucose). Complete saturation observed plot relating J glucose extracellular pyruvate concentration. Measurement pyruvate distribution cell showed mitochondrial pyruvate translocator operates close equilibrium high lactate pyruvate concentrations. therefore concluded pyruvate carboxylase limits maximal gluconeogenic flux. Addition glucagon cause shift plots relating J glucose glucose 6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate. thus concluded glucagon affect kinetic parameters enzymes involved conversion phosphoenolpyruvate glucose. Addition glucagon led shift curves relating J glucose concentration cytosolic oxalacetate extracellular pyruvate. shift curve relating J glucose oxalacetate due glucagon-induced inhibition pyruvate kinase. stimulation gluconeogenesis glucagon accounted almost completely inhibition pyruvate kinase. almost stimulation glucagon pyruvate carboxylation. absence glucagon, control gluconeogenesis lactate distributed among different steps including pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase. Assuming presence glucagon pyruvate kinase flux inhibited, control gluconeogenesis presence hormone confined exclusively pyruvate carboxylase.
