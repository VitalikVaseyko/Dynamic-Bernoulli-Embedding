 ligand-dependent susceptibility heat inactivation tryptic digestion intrinsic fluorescence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-activated pyruvate kinase Escherichia coli investigated absence presence physiological ligands. respect enzyme alone, binding allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate makes protein sensitive tryptic attack thermolabile, binding phosphoenolpyruvate Mg2+, either ligand separately, induces enzyme highly thermostable conformation, attainment require ordered binding sequence two ligands. apparent loosening enzyme structure induced fructose bisphosphate suggests activation exerts low phosphoenolpyruvate concentration might due increased accessibility substrate active site.
