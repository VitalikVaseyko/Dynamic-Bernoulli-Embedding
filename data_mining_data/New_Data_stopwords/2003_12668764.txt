 Neuronal cultures vitro readily oxidized D-[(14)C]glucose l-[(14)C]lactate (14)CO(2), whereas astroglial cultures oxidized substrates sparingly metabolized glucose predominantly lactate released medium. [(14)C]Glucose oxidation (14)CO(2) varied inversely unlabeled lactate concentration medium, particularly neurons, increased progressively decreasing lactate concentration. Adding unlabeled glucose medium inhibited [(14)C]lactate oxidation (14)CO(2) astroglia neurons, indicating kinetic preference neurons oxidation extracellular lactate intracellular pyruvatelactate produced glycolysis. Protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), regulates pyruvate entry tricarboxylic acid cycle. Dichloroacetate inhibits kinase, thus enhancing PDH activity. vitro dichloroacetate stimulated glucose lactate oxidation CO(2) reduced lactate release mainly astroglia, indicating limitations glucose lactate oxidation astroglia may due greater balance PDH toward inactive form. assess significance astroglial export lactate neurons vivo, attempted diminish traffic rats administering dichloroacetate (50 mgkg) intravenously stimulate astroglial lactate oxidation examined effects baseline functionally activated local cerebral glucose utilization (lCMR(glc)). Dichloroacetate raised baseline lCMR(glc) throughout brain decreased percent increases lCMR(glc) evoked functional activation. studies provide evidence support compartmentalization glucose metabolism astroglia neurons indicate compartmentalization may neither complete entirely obligatory.
