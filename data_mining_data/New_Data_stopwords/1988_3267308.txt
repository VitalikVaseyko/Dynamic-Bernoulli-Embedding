 primary human brain tumours shift occurs synthesis isoenzymes pyruvate kinase towards K-type. astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas glioblastomas, localised cerebral hemispheres adult patients 20 years age, shift correlated well histological grading growth rate observed postoperative survival. Gliomas adults, localised midline structures, well childrens gliomas characterised strong shift towards K type. However, tumours, less correlation histological grading growth rate found. isoenzyme shift rapidly demonstrated alanine inhibition test. application assay may diagnostic value operation gliomas grading malignancy adults well demarcation resection gliomas age groups. test performed within 10-15 min thus fit easily surgical procedure. case report presented illustration.
