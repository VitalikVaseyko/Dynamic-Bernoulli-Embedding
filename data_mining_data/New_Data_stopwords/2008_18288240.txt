 present study represents investigation novel stirred bioreactor culture transformed cell line defined hydrodynamic conditions vitro. Cell colonies EL-4 mouse lymphoma cell line grown first time rotating disc bioreactor (RDB), observed undergo changes phenotype comparison standard, static flask cultures. RDB cultures, without agitation, promoted formation adherent EL-4 cell plaques merged form contiguous tumor-like masses longer-term cultures, unlike unattached spheroid aggregates flask cultures. Plaques grown agitated conditions altered morphology distribution direct response fluid mechanical stimuli. Plaque colonies growth RDBs without agitation also exhibited significant increases production interleukin-4 (IL-4) lactate, suggesting inducible "Warburg effect." Increases cell biomass RDB cultures different flask cultures, though trend toward marginal increase observed specific rotational speeds. RDB may therefore suitable alternative method study mechanisms tumor progression invasiveness vitro, complex physicochemical conditions may approximate natural tissue environments.
