 Previous research shown glycolytic enzymes (GEs) exist multienzyme complexes inner surface human erythrocyte membranes. GE binding sites mapped sequences membrane protein, band 3, conserved mammalian homologs, question arose whether GEs organize complexes mammalian erythrocyte membranes. address this, murine erythrocytes stained antibodies glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase analyzed confocal microscopy. GEs found localize membrane oxygenated erythrocytes redistributed cytoplasm upon deoxygenation, seen human erythrocytes. identify membrane proteins involved GE assembly, erythrocytes mice lacking major erythrocyte membrane proteins examined GE localization. GEs band 3 knockout mice membrane associated distributed throughout cytoplasm, regardless erythrocyte oxygenation state. contrast, erythrocytes mice lacking alpha-spectrin, ankyrin, protein 4.2, protein 4.1, beta-adducin, dematin headpiece exhibited GEs bound membrane. data suggest oxygenation-dependent assembly GEs membrane could general phenomenon mammalian erythrocytes stability interactions depends primarily band 3.
