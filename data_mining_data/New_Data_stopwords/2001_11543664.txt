 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Mta protein posttranscriptional regulator EBV lytic gene expression affects RNA splicing transport. Mta mediates cytoplasmic accumulation unspliced EBV replication gene transcripts shuttles nucleus cytoplasm. Mta contains recognized leucine-rich, putative nuclear export signal (NES) aa 227 236. Deletion signal sequence eliminated shuttling, mutation core LXL motif putative NES diminished abolish ability Mta shuttle donor recipient cells heterokaryon assay. double mutation LXL motif plus upstream VTL motif eliminated shuttling, suggesting Mta may two NES motifs. confirmation this, transfer either sequence encoding leucine-rich aa 227-236 motif encoding adjacent hydrophobic aa 218-227 sequence GFP-NLS-pyruvate kinase reporter protein conferred property cytoplasmic accumulation onto heterologous protein. Cytoplasmic accumulation aa 225-237 218-227 containing reporters minimal presence inhibitor leptomycin B, indicating motifs mediated Crm-1-dependent export. Mutations NES signal sequences abolished ability Mta mediate cytoplasmic accumulation BALF2 replication gene transcripts. included mutation LXL motif still showed cytoplasmic shuttling, suggesting NES mutations might additional effects Mta function. Wild-type Mta co-immunoprecipitated splicing factor SC35 colocalized SC35 transfected cells, modifying endogenous SC35 distribution within nucleus give intense, rounded spots. Interestingly, NES mutant proteins appeared altered interactions splicing complex, binding tightly SC35 co-immunoprecipitation assays. observations suggest linkage splicing export functions Mta.
