 method fractionation swine erythrocytes according age using Percoll described. Centrifugation erythrocytes discontinuous Percoll gradients yielded four fractions erythrocytes. ascertain fraction erythrocytes represented different age group, activities hexokinase (Hx), aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) determined. enzyme activities decreased successively top bottom fractions centrifuged column. Young erythrocytes obtained upper fractions centrifuged column exhibited higher activity enzyme found heavier older erythrocytes bottom fraction. method proposed appropriate use aid distinguishing presence young erythrocyte population.
