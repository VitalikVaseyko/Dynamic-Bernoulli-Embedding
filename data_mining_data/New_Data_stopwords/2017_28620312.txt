 Gliomas cells site numerous metabolic thermodynamics abnormalities increasing entropy rate characteristic irreversible processes driven changes Gibbs energy, heat production, intracellular acidity, membrane potential gradient, ionic conductance. focus review opposing interactions observed glioma canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway PPAR gamma metabolic thermodynamic implications. gliomas, WNT/beta-catenin pathway upregulated PPAR gamma downregulated. Upregulation WNT/beta-catenin signaling induces changes key metabolic enzyme modify thermodynamics behavior. leads activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK-1) monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1). Consequently, phosphorylation PDK-1 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Thus, large part pyruvate cannot converted acetyl-CoA mitochondria TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle. leads aerobic glycolysis despite availability oxygen, named Warburg effect. Cytoplasmic pyruvate is, major part, converted lactate. WNT/beta-catenin pathway induces also transcription genes involved cell proliferation, cell invasiveness, nucleotide synthesis, tumor growth, angiogenesis, c-Myc, cyclin D1, PDK. addition, gliomas cells, PPAR gamma downregulated, leading decrease insulin sensitivity increase neuroinflammation. Moreover, PPAR gamma contributes regulate key circadian genes. Abnormalities regulation circadian rhythms dysregulation circadian clock genes observed gliomas. Circadian rhythms dissipative structures, play key role far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics interactions WNT/beta-catenin pathway PPAR gamma. gliomas, metabolism, thermodynamics, circadian rhythms tightly interrelated.
