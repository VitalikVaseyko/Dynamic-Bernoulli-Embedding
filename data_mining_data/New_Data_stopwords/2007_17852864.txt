 OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) children creates diagnostic clinical challenges. Clinical data, endoscopic appearance histopathological assessment biopsies essential diagnosis. However, new methods required non-invasive follow-up. Recently, demonstrated dimeric isoform pyruvate kinase (PK) detected stool might serve potential non-invasive screening tool inflamed pouch mucosa. aim study investigate whether test could used detect intestinal inflammation pediatric IBD patients. MATERIAL METHODS: Fecal PK immunoreactivity assessed 75 patients proven ulcerative colitis (UC) 32 Crohn's disease (CD). Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) Truelove-Witts scores determined CD UC patients, respectively. Thirty-five healthy subjects (HS) served control group. RESULTS: Increased PK levels documented 94.1% 100% active CD patients cut-off level 5 U/g cut-off level 4 U/g, respectively, 94.3% active UC patients regardless cut-off level. Enzyme immunoreactivity significantly higher IBD patients HS. Abnormal PK results documented 71.7% IBD patients (65.3% 84.4 UC CD patients, respectively). Enzyme levels UC remission significantly lower active phase. Enzyme immunoreactivity significantly correlated scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: measurement stool PK could potentially useful marker IBD activity children. However, clinical value demands studies comparison tests.
