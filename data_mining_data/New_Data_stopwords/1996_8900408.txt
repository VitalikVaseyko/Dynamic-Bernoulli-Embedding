 reaction fluoride adenosine triphosphate studied nonenzymatic analog pyruvate kinase-catalyzed fluorokinase reaction. production fluorophosphate, well adenosine 5'-O-fluorophosphate (FAMP) adenosine 5'-O-(2-fluorodiphosphate) (betaFADP) found dependent presence polyvalent metal ions. ions tested showed significant activity. Two catalytic regimes cations could distinguished: less specific enhancement product formation lower fluoride/cation ratios, considerably active specific (for fluorophosphate production) enhancement high fluoride/cation ratios. comparison results studies cation-catalyzed nucleotide hydrolysis indicates fluorolysis mechanisms analogous hydrolysis hydroxyl ions observed high pH. addition nonenzymatic studies, experiments performed using several commercially available kinases indicated significant fluorokinase activity two: glycerokinase acetate kinase, although activities much pyruvate kinase. exception concentrations used studies, reactions proceed physiological conditions, yielding products sufficient concentrations readily detected 19F NMR spectroscopy.
