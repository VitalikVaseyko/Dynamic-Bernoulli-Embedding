 Ca2+-activated protease [32P]phosphopyruvate kinase substrate purified 50% rat erythrocytes. purification involved chromatography Sepharose/Sephadex gels, DEAE-cellulose (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. protease required 3.3 mM Ca2+ full activity. pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) purified erythrocytes incubated [32P]phosphate contained 0.5 mol [32P]phosphate/mol enzyme subunit. 3.3 mM Ca2+ added hemolysis incorporation decreased. possible importance Ca2+-activated protease regulation pyruvate kinase erythrocytes discussed.
