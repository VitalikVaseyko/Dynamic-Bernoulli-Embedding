 Male albino rats given subcutaneous injection isoproterenol (10 mg/100 g body wt) twice interval 24 hr induce myocardial infarction. rats showed massive myocardial necrosis increased activities creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), serum, decrease nitric oxide synthase activity lower levels palmitate oxidation CO2 ATP observed heart. Rats pre-treated coconut protein L-arginine showed significantly decreased CPK, GOT GPT activities serum. significantly higher nitric oxide synthase activity higher rate palmitate oxidation CO2 increased levels ATP heart groups. observations indicate cardioprotective effect coconut protein, may attributed high content L-arginine present it.
