 study, used systems biology approach investigate changes proteome metabolome shrimp hemocytes infected invertebrate virus WSSV (white spot syndrome virus) viral genome replication stage (12 hpi) late stage (24 hpi). 12 hpi, 24 hpi, significant up-regulation markers several metabolic pathways associated vertebrate Warburg effect (or aerobic glycolysis), including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide biosynthesis, glutaminolysis amino acid biosynthesis. show PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway central importance triggering WSSV-induced Warburg effect. Although dsRNA silencing mTORC1 activator Rheb relatively minor impact WSSV replication, vivo chemical inhibition Akt, mTORC1 mTORC2 suppressed WSSV-induced Warburg effect reduced WSSV gene expression viral genome replication. Warburg effect suppressed pretreatment mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, even subsequent up-regulation TCA cycle insufficient satisfy virus's requirements energy macromolecular precursors. WSSV-induced Warburg effect therefore appears essential successful viral replication.
