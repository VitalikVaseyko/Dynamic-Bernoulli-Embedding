 Noncoding microRNAs inhibit translation lower transcript stability coding mRNA, however miR-369 s, aberrant silencing genomic regions, stabilizes target proteins cellular stress. found vitro differentiation embryonic stem cells led chromatin methylation histone H3K4 miR-369 region chromosome 12qF mice, expressed embryonic cells critical pluripotency. Proteomic analyses revealed miR-369 stabilized translation pyruvate kinase (Pkm2) splicing factors HNRNPA2B1. Overexpression miR-369 stimulated Pkm2 splicing enhanced induction cellular reprogramming induced pluripotent stem cell factors, whereas miR-369 knockdown resulted suppression. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis showed Argonaute complex contained fragile X mental retardation-related protein 1 HNRNPA2B1 miR-369-depedent manner. findings demonstrate unique role embryonic miR-369-HNRNPA2B1 axis controlling metabolic enzyme function, suggest novel pathway linking epigenetic, transcriptional, metabolic control cell reprogramming.
