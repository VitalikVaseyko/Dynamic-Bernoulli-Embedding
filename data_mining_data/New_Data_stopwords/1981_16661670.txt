 Incubation water 30 C/14-hour 12 C/10-hour photoperiod caused CO(2) compensation points 10 aquatic macrophytes decrease 25 increase 50 microliters CO(2) per liter, respectively. Submerged aerial leaves two amphibious angiosperms (Myriophyllum brasiliense Proserpinaca palustris) maintained high compensation points incubated air but, submerged aerial leaves Proserpinaca incubated water, compensation points dropped low 10. suggests that, addition temperature photoperiod, factor associated submergence regulates compensation point aquatic plants. high-compensation point plants, photorespiration, percentage net photosynthesis, equivalent terrestrial C(3) plants. Hydrilla verticillata, decreasing CO(2) compensation points (110, 40, 10) associated reduced photorespiration, indicated decreased O(2) inhibition, decreased rates CO(2) evolution CO(2)-free air, increased net photosynthetic rates.The decrease CO(2) compensation points Hydrilla, Egeria densa, Cabomba caroliniana accompanied increase activity phosphoenolpyruvate, ribulose bisphosphate, carboxylase. Hydrilla, several C(4) enzymes also increased activity following levels (micromoles per gram fresh weight per hour): pyruvate Pi dikinase (35), pyrophosphatase (716), adenylate kinase (525), NAD NADP malate dehydrogenase (6565 30), NAD NADP malic enzymes (239 44), aspartate alanine aminotransferases (357 85), whereas glycolate oxidase (6) phosphoglycolate phosphoglycerate phosphatases (76 32) showed change. Glycolate dehydrogenase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase undetectable. reduced photorespiration plants may due increased CO(2) fixation via C(4) acid pathway. However, three Myriophyllum species, mechanism appears operative, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase increased low compensation point state, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase remained predominant carboxylation enzyme.
