 studies metabolic control mechanisms skeletal muscle rhesus fetus determined tissue levels metabolic intermediates cofactors glycolytic pathway calculated mass-action ratios reaction. Skeletal muscle rhesus fetuses (Macaca mulatta), 90-155 days gestational age, adult rhesus monkeys used experiments. apparent equilibrium constants hexokinase phosphofructokinase (PFK) tissues 1,000 times larger mass-action ratios ages studied; corresponding values pyruvate kinase 800 times different. data suggest three enzymes rate-limiting fetal skeletal muscle early 54% gestation. next step study numerous factors modify non-equilibrium reactions. Increasing ATP concentration marked effect PFK activity fetal adult muscle, first increasing inhibiting enzyme activity. maximum PFK activity, amount fructose-6-PO4(F6P) phosphorylated per mg protein 2-3 times greater two fetal adult series. concentration 0.3 mM, citrate decreased PFK activity 100-day fetal muscle; decrease occurred 1.2 mM citrate. citrate level 0.3 mM. addition inorganic phosphate (Pi) cyclic AMP returned PFK activity uninhibited levels (pH 7.0). Relief ATP inhibition F6P phosphorylation Pi cyclic AMP also observed pH 7.0 extracts 100-day fetal skeletal muscle.
