 substrate cycle composed phosphofructo 1-kinase (PFK) fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase (FBPase) proposed rat spermatids. substrate cycle explain ability glucose induce decrease intracellular ATP, phenomenon related regulation [Ca(2+)]i cells. spite importance metabolic cycle, expression activities enzymes compose cycle systematically studied spermatogenic cells. Here, show PFK FBPase activities present pachytene spermatocytes round spermatids extracts. Expression PFK mRNA protein levels showed relatively similar expression spermatogenic cells, stronger expression Sertoli cells. Instead, expression FBPase mRNA protein levels stronger round elongating spermatids compared spermatogenic cells. similar pattern observed evidencing FBPase activity NADPH-nitroblue tetrazolium-linked cytochemical assay isolated pachytene spermatocytes round spermatids. Rat spermatids also showed ability convert lactate fructose- glucose-6-P, indicating glycolytic gluconeogenic fluxes present cells. results indicate coordinated expression key substrate cycle enzymes, level PFK/FBPase, appear last stages spermatogenic cell differentiation, suggesting co-regulation enzymes required ability cells respond glucose induce metabolic Ca(2+) signals important sperm development function.
