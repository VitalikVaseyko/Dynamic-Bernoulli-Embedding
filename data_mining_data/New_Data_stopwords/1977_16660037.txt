 ATP-dependent inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) examined using ruptured mitochondria partially purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex isolated broccoli cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) bud mitochondria. ATP-dependent inactivation temperature- pH-dependent. [(32)P]ATP experiments show specific transphosphorylation gamma-PO(4) ATP complex. phosphate attached PDC labile mild alkaline mild acidic conditions. inactivated-phosphorylated PDC reactivated 20 mm MgCl(2), dialysis, Sephadex G-25 treatment, apyrase action, potato acid phosphatase action. However, partially purified bovine heart PDC phosphatase catalyzed reactivation dephosphorylation isolated plant PDC. ATP-dependent inactivation-phosphorylation PDC inhibited pyruvate. concluded ATP-dependent inactivation-phosphorylation broccoli cauliflower mitochondrial PDC catalyzed PDC kinase. concluded PDC broccoli cauliflower mitochondria capable interconversion active (dephosphorylated) inactive (phosphorylated) form.
