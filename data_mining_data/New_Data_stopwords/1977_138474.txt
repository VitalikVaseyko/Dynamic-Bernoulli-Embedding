 Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) Neurospora, tetramer composed apparently identical subunits, shown dimer dimers interprotomeric cross-linking experiments bifunctional reagents used. analysis polyacrylamide gel profiles enzyme cross-linking glutaraldehyde, dimethyl suberimidate, dimethyl adipimidate shows extent intersubunit cross-linking influenced markedly ligand bound enzyme. Bifunctional cross-linking reagents shorter distance two functional groups form cross-links effectively unliganded enzyme. FDP-pyruvate kinase complex, cross-linking observed longer distances compared unliganded enzyme. demonstrated covalent cross-linkers cah used sensitive indicators conformational changes induced pyruvate kinase substrates allosteric ligands.
