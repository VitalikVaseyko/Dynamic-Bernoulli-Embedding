 Formate formed extracts Chlorogonium elongatum via direct cleavage pyruvate pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL, EC 2.3.1.54). conversion PFL catalytically active form required S-adenosylmethionine, ferric (2+), photoreduced deazariboflavin reductant, pyruvate allosteric effector strict anaerobic conditions. optimum pH (pH 8.0), PFL catalyzed formate formation, pyruvate synthesis isotope exchange [(14)C]formate pyruvate rates 30.0, 1.5 1.2 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively. Treatment active enzyme O2 irreversibly inactivated PFL activity (half-time 2 min). addition PFL, activities phosphotransacetylase (EC 2.3.1.8), acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1), aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA acetylating, EC 1.2.1.10) alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) also detected extracts C. elongatum. occurrence enzymes indicates pyruvate degradation via formate-fermentation pathway anaerobiosis algal cells dark.
