 previously identified TSC22D2 (transforming growth factor beta-stimulated clone 22 domain family, member 2) novel cancer-associated gene rare multi-cancer family. However, role tumor development remains completely unknown. study, found TSC22D2 significantly downregulated colorectal cancer (CRC) TSC22D2 overexpression inhibited cell growth. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay combined mass spectrometry analysis identify TSC22D2-interacting proteins, demonstrated TSC22D2 interacts pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2). findings confirmed results immunoprecipitation immunofluorescence assays. Moreover, overexpression TSC22D2 reduced level nuclear PKM2 suppressed cyclin D1 expression. Collectively, study reveals growth suppressor function TSC22D2 least partially dependent TSC22D2-PKM2-cyclinD1 regulatory axis. addition, data provide important clues might contribute future studies evaluating role TSC22D2.
