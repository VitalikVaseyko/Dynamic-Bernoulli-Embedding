 decribed preparation adenine 1-oxide nucleotides oxidation natural compounds monopermaleic acid aqueous solutions neutral pH, overall yield chromatographic purification 75 80%. irradiated, adenine 1-oxide nucleotides undergo photochemical rearrangement reaction, main photoproducts aqueous solution alkaline pH corresponding isoguanine nucleotides. modified ring vibration pattern 1-oxide analogues well 13C chemical shift indicate loss aromaticity compared natural compounds. Coupling constant measurements show dihedral angle 31POC OC13C planes around 180degree, i.e., trans, natural adenine nucleotides. modified adenine nucleotides tested potential substrates and/or inhibitors mitochondrial processes, substrates varous phosphotransferases mitochondria cytosol, allosteric effectors reactions catalyzed glutamate dehydrogenase phosphofructokinase. Although adenine 1-oxide nucleotides recognized translocase system inner mitochondrial membrane, good substrates mitochondrial phosphotransferases located intermembrane space. Similarly, participate phosphoryl group transfer reactions catalyzed pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, hexokinase. allosteric effectors, modified nucleotides less active natural compounds, probably lower binding capacity allosteric sites regulatory enzymes.
