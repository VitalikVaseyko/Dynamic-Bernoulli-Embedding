 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) currently considered worldwide epidemic finding effective therapeutic strategies disease highly important. deoxynojirimycin-polysaccharide mixture (DPM) previously shown exert hypoglycemic effects alloxan- streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. purpose present study evaluate therapeutic effects underlying mechanism(s) DPM T2DM induced high fat diet following low-dose STZ treatment mice. daily oral treatment diabetic mice DPM (150 mg/kg b.w.) 90 d, significant decline blood glucose, pyruvate, triglyceride (TG), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine (Cr), lipid peroxide (LPO) malondialdehyde (MDA) levels well evident increases high density lipoprotein (HDL-c) hepatic glycogen concentrations observed. first stage, DPM administered 60 d, blood insulin levels undergo significant change significant decrease HOMA-IR index detected. contrast, HOMA-IR index increased significantly T2MD controls. second stage, DPM treatment continued another 30 d, insulin levels significantly increased DPM-treated mice comparison T2DM controls. results indicate insulin resistance pre-diabetic period dysfunction pancreatic beta-cells ameliorated DPM treatment. DPM also down-regulated protein levels insulin receptor (IR) gluconeogenic enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glucose-6-phosphatase) peripheral tissues (liver and/or muscle), enhanced expressions insulin pancreas, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) glycolysis enzymes (glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, private kinase pyruvate decarboxylase E1) liver. Furthermore, deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) polysaccharide (P) found increase proliferation hepatic LO-2 cells scavenging radicals vitro. results support results biochemical analyses underscore possible mechanisms underlying protective effects DPM STZ-induced damage pancreas liver. Taken together, findings suggest DPM may developed antihyperglycemic agent treatment diabetes mellitus.
