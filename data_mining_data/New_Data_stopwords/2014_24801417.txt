 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cancer cells exhibit reprogrammed metabolism characterized high level glycolysis even presence oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect, supplies cancer cells substrates required biomass generation. date, several intracellular signaling mediators identified metabolic regulation cancer cells. However, remains largely ambiguous molecules cell surface involved regulation cancer metabolism. METHODS: current study, established several HCC cell lines differing CD147 (a typical transmembrane glycoprotein) expression status zinc-finger nuclease RNAi techniques. Then, systematically investigated role CD147 regulation Warburg effect HCC cells explored underlying mechanism. RESULTS: found CD147 significantly contributed reprogramming glucose metabolism HCC cells p53-dependent way. CD147 facilitated cell surface expression MCT1 lactate export, led activation PI3K/Akt/MDM2 pathway thus increased p53 degradation. gain/loss-of-function studies demonstrated CD147 promoted glycolysis, mediated p53-dependent upregulation GLUT1 activation PFKL, inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis functions, mediated p53-dependent downregulation PGC1alpha, TFAM, p53R2. Additionally, proliferation HCC cells suppressed blocking CD147 and/or MCT1, resulted down-regulation glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: demonstrate CD147 crucial regulator glucose metabolism.
