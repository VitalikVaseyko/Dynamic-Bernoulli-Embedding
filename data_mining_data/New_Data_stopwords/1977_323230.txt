 mutant yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient pyruvate kinase activity isolated. mutant strain capable growth supplied lactate carbon source capable growth supplied dextrose fermentable sugars glycerol carbon source. Genetic analysis demonstrated phenotype pyruvate kinase-deficient strain due single nuclear mutation, designated pyk1, preliminary genetic mapping experiments located pyk1 locus chromosome I, 30 centimorgans ade1 locus. Adenine nucleotide levels mutant parental strains compared cells subjected various growth starvation conditions. carbon supply energy production dissociated supplying mutant strain dextrose, adenine nucleotide levels fell dramatically. result suggests initial reactions glycolysis rate limiting, readily inhibited feedback controls.
