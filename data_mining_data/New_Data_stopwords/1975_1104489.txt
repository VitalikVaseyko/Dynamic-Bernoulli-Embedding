 Several investigators reported lipid biologically active unit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule. determine lipid responsible reported increases pyruvate kinase, mice injected endotoxin Salmonella typhimurium SR-11, mutant Salmonella minnesota R 595, lipid A-bovine serum albumin conjugate. livers homogenized activity pyruvate kinase measured. Similar increases enzyme obtained three preparations. data imply lipid portion LPS molecule responsible alterations host enzyme activity. determine lipid portion active unit, lipid-degraded endotoxin (endotoxoid) prepared potassium methylate treatment inoculated mice. initial increase liver pyruvate kinase activity observed preparations. marked increase observed 16 h native product lipid conjugate obtained endotoxoid. experiments extend confirm previous observations lipid responsible effects associated LPS. Animals tolerant endotoxin S. typhimurium SR-11 challenged endotoxin mutant. significant increase pyruvate kinase activity obtained, suggesting anti-O antibodies important development tolerance.
