 Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha) transcription factor frequently stabilized active human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). found constitutively active HIF1alpha sufficient cause neoplastic transformation murine model ccRCC termed TRACK model. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) untargeted metabolomics analyses samples TRACK kidneys demonstrate HIF1alpha activates transcription genes cause increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, lactate production, well decrease flux pyruvate entering tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle decrease oxidative phosphorylation; changes identical observed human ccRCC samples. studies show constitutively active HIF1alpha promotes tumorigenesis TRACK mice mediating metabolic switch aerobic glycolysis, i.e., Warburg effect, suggest TRACK mice valid model test novel therapies targeting metabolic changes inhibit human ccRCC.
