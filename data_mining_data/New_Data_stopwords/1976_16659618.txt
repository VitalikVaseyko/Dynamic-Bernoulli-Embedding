 effects cyanide ethylene, respectively, studied respiration fully cyanide-sensitive tissue-the fresh pea, slightly cyanide-sensitive tissue-the germinating pea seedling, cyanide-insensitive tissue-the cherimoya fruit. Cyanide inhibition fresh pea pea seedling respiration attended conventional Pasteur effect fermentation enhanced accumulation lactate ethanol change level glycolytic intermediates indicative activation phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase accompanied sharp decline ATP level. tissues, ethylene little effect respiration rate, level glycolytic intermediates ATP. contrast, ethylene well cyanide enhanced respiration aerobic glycolysis cherimoya fruits buildup lactate ethanol increase level ATP. data support proposition ethylene stimulate respiration capacity cyanide-resistant respiration must present.
