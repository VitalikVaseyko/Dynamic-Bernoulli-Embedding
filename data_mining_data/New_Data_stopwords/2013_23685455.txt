 response tenacious stress signals, unscheduled activation oncogenes, cells mobilize tumour suppressor networks avert hazard malignant transformation. large body evidence indicates oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) acts break, withdrawing cells proliferative pool almost irreversibly, thus crafting vital pathophysiological mechanism protects cancer. Despite widespread contribution OIS cessation tumorigenic expansion animal models humans, begun define underlying mechanism identify key players. Although deregulation metabolism intimately linked proliferative capacity cells, senescent cells thought remain metabolically active, little investigated detail role cellular metabolism OIS. show, metabolic profiling functional perturbations, mitochondrial gatekeeper pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) crucial mediator senescence induced BRAF(V600E), oncogene commonly mutated melanoma cancers. BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence accompanied simultaneous suppression PDH-inhibitory enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) induction PDH-activating enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 2 (PDP2). resulting combined activation PDH enhanced use pyruvate tricarboxylic acid cycle, causing increased respiration redox stress. Abrogation OIS, rate-limiting step towards oncogenic transformation, coincided reversion processes. supporting crucial role PDH OIS, enforced normalization either PDK1 PDP2 expression levels inhibited PDH abrogated OIS, thereby licensing BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma development. Finally, depletion PDK1 eradicated melanoma subpopulations resistant targeted BRAF inhibition, caused regression established melanomas. results reveal mechanistic relationship OIS key metabolic signalling axis, may exploited therapeutically.
