 Gluconeogenesis essential pathway methanogens unable use exogenous hexoses carbon source cell growth. aim understanding regulatory mechanisms central carbon metabolism Methanosarcina acetivorans, present study investigated gene expression, activities metabolic regulation key enzymes, metabolite contents fluxes gluconeogenesis, well glycolysis glycogen synthesis/degradation pathways. Cells grown methanol carbon source. Key enzymes kinetically characterized physiological pH/temperature. Active consumption methanol exponential cell growth correlated significant methanogenesis, gluconeogenic flux steady glycogen synthesis. methanol exhaustion, cells reached stationary growth phase, correlated rise glycogen consumption glycolytic flux, decreased methanogenesis, negligible acetate production absence gluconeogenesis. Elevated activities carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthetase complex pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase suggested generation acetyl-CoA pyruvate glycogen synthesis. early stationary growth phase, transcript contents activities pyruvate phosphate dikinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase glycogen synthase decreased, whereas glycogen phosphorylase, ADP-phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase increased. Therefore, glycogen gluconeogenic metabolites synthesized external carbon source provided. carbon source became depleted, glycolysis methanogenesis fed glycogen degradation provided ATP supply. Weak inhibition key enzymes metabolites suggested pathways evaluated mainly transcriptionally regulated. glycogen metabolism glycolysis/gluconeogenesis present methanogens, overall data suggest glycogen storage might represent environmental advantage methanosarcinales carbon sources scarce. Also, understanding central carbohydrate metabolism methanosarcinales may help optimize methane production.
