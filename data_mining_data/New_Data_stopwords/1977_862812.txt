 Based observations made human dog red blood cells, recently proposed response red cell glycolysis variations levels specific cations evolutionary adaptation response specific cellular environment. examined effect K+ Na+ activity pyruvate kinase (PK) red blood cells 2 genetically different types sheep high potassium (HK) low potassium (LK). results indicate K+ stimulate glucose consumption activity PK types sheep. thus appears red cell PK LK sheep fit concept cellular environment PK activity.
