 kinetics pyruvate kinase Saccharomyces cerevisiae studied assays pH 6.2 25 degrees C function concentrations substrates ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate Mg2+ concentration effector fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. enzyme activated 100 mM-K+ 32 mM-NH4+ throughout. found increase fructose bisphosphate concentration 24 microM 1.2 mM brings transition sigmoidal non-inflected form relationships v = f([phosphoenolpyruvate]) v = f([Mg2+]) together large increase affinity substrates enzyme. binding behaviour ADP barely affected change effector concentration. contrast, increase fructose bisphosphate concentration 24 microM increases affinity enzyme substrates sigmoidicity corresponding velocity-substrate-concentration relationships. result change behaviour found impossible represent data exponential model regulatory enzyme, suggested (supported comparisons previous work) failure may reflect secondary action effector upon enzyme.
