 AIM: present critical discussion efficacy faecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (faecal M2-PK) test colorectal cancer (CRC) screening based currently available studies. METHODS: literature search PubMed Embase conducted using following search terms: fecal Tumor M2-PK, faecal Tumour M2-PK, fecal M2-PK, faecal M2-PK, fecal pyruvate kinase, faecal pyruvate kinase, pyruvate kinase stool M2-PK stool. RESULTS: Stool samples 704 patients CRC 11 412 healthy subjects investigated faecal M2-PK concentrations seventeen independent studies. mean faecal M2-PK sensitivity 80.3%; specificity 95.2%. Four studies compared faecal M2-PK head-to-head guaiac-based faecal occult blood test (gFOBT). Faecal M2-PK demonstrated sensitivity 81.1%, whereas gFOBT detected 36.9% CRCs. Eight independent studies investigated sensitivity faecal M2-PK adenoma (n = 554), following sensitivities: adenoma < 1 cm diameter: 25%; adenoma > 1 cm: 44%; adenoma unspecified diameter: 51%. direct comparison gFOBT adenoma > 1 cm diameter, 47% tested positive faecal M2-PK test, whereas gFOBT detected 27%. CONCLUSION: recommend faecal M2-PK routine test CRC screening. Faecal M2-PK closes gap clinical practice detects bleeding non-bleeding tumors adenoma high sensitivity specificity.
