 Despite multimodal therapeutic treatments osteosarcoma (OS), patients develop resistance currently available regimens eventually end recurrent metastatic outcomes. Many attempts made discover effective drugs improving outcome; however, due heterogeneity disease, new therapeutic options yet identified. study aims explore potential targeted therapy related protein profiles OS. review proteomics studies, extracted data differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) archived literature PubMed in-house repository. data divided three experimental groups, DEPs 1) OS/OB: OS vs osteoblastic (OB) cells, 2) metastasis: metastatic vs non-metastatic sublines plus fresh tissues primary OS without pulmonary metastasis, 3) chemoresistance: spheroid (higher chemoresistance) vs monolayer cells plus fresh tissues biopsies good poor responders. up-regulated protein entities list DEPs sorted cross-referenced identifiers targets US Food Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents chemical inhibitors. found many targets FDA-approved antineoplastic agents, mainly group epigenetic regulators, kinases, proteasomes, highly expressed OS cells. Additionally, overexpressed proteins targets FDA-approved non-cancer drugs, including immunosuppressive antiarrhythmic drugs. resulting list chemical agents showed transferase enzyme inhibitors might anticancer activity. also explored common targets OS/OB metastasis groups, including amidophosphoribosyltransferase (PPAT), l-lactate dehydrogenase B chain (LDHB), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) well common target categories, cathepsin (CTSD). study demonstrates benefits text mining approach exploring therapeutic targets related protein expression patterns. results suggest possible repurposing FDA-approved medicines treatment OS using chemical inhibitors drug screening tests.
