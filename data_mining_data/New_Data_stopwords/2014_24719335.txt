 Glycosylation plays critical role biogenesis function membrane proteins. Transient receptor potential channel TRPP2 nonselective cation channel mutated autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. TRPP2 shown heavily N-glycosylated, glycosylation sites biological role N-linked glycosylation investigated. show, using combination mass spectrometry biochemical approaches, native TRPP2 glycosylated five asparagines first extracellular loop. Glycosylation required efficient biogenesis TRPP2 mutations glycosylated asparagines result strongly decreased protein expression ion channel. Wild-type N-glycosylation-deficient TRPP2 degraded lysosomes, shown increased TRPP2 protein levels upon chemical inhibition lysosomal degradation. addition, using pharmacological genetic approaches, demonstrate glucosidase II (GII) mediates glycan trimming TRPP2. non-catalytic beta subunit glucosidase II (GIIbeta) encoded PRKCSH, one genes causing autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD). impaired GIIbeta-dependent glucose trimming TRPP2 glycosylation ADPLD may explain decreased TRPP2 protein expression Prkcsh(-/-) mice genetic interaction observed TRPP2 PRKCSH ADPLD. results highlight biological importance N-linked glycosylation GII-mediated glycan trimming control biogenesis stability TRPP2.
