 1. Pyruvate kinase purified hepatopancrease Carcinus maenas exhibited sigmoidal saturation kinetics respect substrate phosphoenolpyruvate absence allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, normal hyperbolic saturation seen presence activator. activation appears result decrease s0.5 (phosphoenolpyruvate) change Vmax. 2. presence ADP ATP constant nucleotide-pool size results indicate phosphoenolpyruvate co-operativity lost increasing [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. 3. Paralleling change observation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activation became less [ATP]/[ATP] ratio increased. due enzyme exhibiting near-maximal activity absence activator. 4. L-Alanine inhibited enzyme, homotropic co-operative interactions seen cruder (1000000g supernatant) enzyme preparation. inhibition alanine could overcome increasing concentration either phosphoenolpyruvate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, although increasing L-alanine concentration appear able reverse activation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. 5. presence low concentration phosphoenolpyruvate, increasing concentration product, ATP, caused initial increase enzyme activity, followed inhibitory phase. presence either fructose 1,6-bisphosphate L-alanine inhibition seen. 6. inhibition ATP could completely reversed fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
