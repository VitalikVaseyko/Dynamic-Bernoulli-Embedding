 Reactive oxygen species (ROS), vital normal cellular function, harmful effects cells, leading development diseases cancer. Warburg effect, shift oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, even presence adequate oxygen, important metabolic change confers many growth survival advantages cancer cells. Reactive oxygen species important regulators Warburg effect. mitochondria-localized antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) vital survival oxygen-rich atmosphere scavenges mitochondrial ROS. MnSOD important cancer development progression. However, significance MnSOD regulation Warburg effect revealed, may significantly impact treatment cancer future.
