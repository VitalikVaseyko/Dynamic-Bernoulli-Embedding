 report divided two parts. first section shows vesicles derived sarcoplasmic reticulum rats skeletal muscle cleave ATP faster rate produce heat vesicles derived rabbit skeletal muscle. second part, compared rates Ca(2+) transport ATP hydrolysis rats rabbits heart sarcoplasmic reticulum. shown two vesicles preparations able use glucose 6-phosphate hexokinase ATP regenerative system. rates Ca(2+)-uptake ATP hydrolysis measured glucose 6-phosphate hexokinase four six times slower measured phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase ATP regenerative system.
