 Eleven patients established disturbance muscle mitochondrial energy generation, defect pyruvate dehydrogenase complex complexes respiratory chain could detected, investigated possible deficiency mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mi-CK) (EC 2.7.3.2). Four patients defect one complexes respiratory chain also investigated Mi-CK activity. none investigated patients Mi-CK deficiency found. Surprisingly, two four patients defect one respiratory chain complexes showed enhanced activity Mi-CK. concluded Mi-CK deficiency frequently found primary defect patients disturbance mitochondrial energy generation, patients examined allow definite conclusion.
