 metabolic pathways interconversion oxalacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate Pseudomonas citronellolis form interlocking system (Scheme 1) would appear require complex regulatory mechanisms permit proper flow metabolites pathways prevent futile cycling. Oxalacetate decarboxylase (I Scheme 1), P-enolpyruvate synthase (II), P-enolpyruvate carboxylase (III), pyruvate kinase (V) constitutive enzymes organism. Pyruvate carboxylase (VI) inducible highest activity cells grown glucose lactate, moderate activity cells grown acetate, citrate, glutamate, virtually activity aspartate-grown cells. P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (IV) detected. presence five enzymes single cell previously reported. Scheme 1, three futile cycles possible: simultaneous operation Reactions VI; Reactions II V; I, II, III. examination regulatory properties individual enzymes partial purification offers support hypothesis intricate regulatory system. Oxalacetate decarboxylase (I) inhibited acetyl-CoA; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (III) activated acetyl-CoA ADP inhibited aspartate; phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (II) inhibited 5'-AMP phosphoenolpyruvate; pyruvate kinase (V) activated 5'-AMP 2 keto, 3-deoxy,6-phosphogluconate inhibited ATP. presence metabolites reciprocal reinforcing functions noteworthy. example, acetyl-CoA inhibits breakdown oxalacetate stimulates formation. pyruvate carboxylase appears regulated carbon substrates growth medium.
