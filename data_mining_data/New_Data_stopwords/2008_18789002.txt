 Human colon cancer cells primary colon cancer silence gene coding LDH (lactate dehydrogenase)-B up-regulate gene coding LDH-A, resulting effective conversion pyruvate lactate. associated markedly reduced levels pyruvate cancer cells compared non-malignant cells. silencing LDH-B cancer cells occurs via DNA methylation, involvement DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases) DNMT1 DNMT3b. Colon cancer also associated expression pyruvate kinase M2, splice variant low catalytic activity. shown recently pyruvate inhibitor HDACs (histone deacetylases). show pyruvate specific inhibitor HDAC1 HDAC3. Lactate effect HDACs examined. Colon cancer cells exhibit increased HDAC activity compared non-malignant cells. HDAC1 HDAC3 up-regulated colon cancer cells primary colon cancer, siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated silencing HDAC1 HDAC3 colon cancer cells induces apoptosis. Colon cancer cells silence SLC5A8, gene coding Na(+)-coupled pyruvate transporter. Heterologous expression SLC5A8 human colon cancer cell line SW480 leads inhibition HDAC activity cultured presence pyruvate. process associated increase intracellular levels pyruvate, increase acetylation status histone H4, enhanced cell death. studies show cancer cells effectively maintain low levels pyruvate prevent inhibition HDAC1/HDAC3 thereby evade cell death.
