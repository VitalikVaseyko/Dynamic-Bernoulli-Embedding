 examined control hormones culture conditions expression pyruvate kinase L, aldolase B, liver-specific 5.4-kb mRNA species [Pichard, A. L. et al. (1985) Biochem. J. 226, 637-644] three rat hepatoma cell lines, MH1C1, Fao Faza. expression level markers ranges 2% (for pyruvate kinase L mRNA) 10-12% (for 5.4-kb mRNA species) glucose-induced mRNA values found rat liver. mRNAs three liver-specific genes strongly decrease treatment hepatoma cells cyclic 8-bromo-AMP, cyclic dibutyryl-AMP forkolin, pyruvate kinase L mRNA sensitive inhibiting effect. contrast, concentration pyruvate kinase L mRNA nuclear precursors modified cyclic AMP analogues, indicating agents act transcriptional level but, instead, probably destabilize transcripts. Glucose fructose modify expression three marker genes studied cell lines. Insulin inefficient modifying concentrations mRNAs pyruvate kinase L aldolase B, alone presence carbohydrates. contrast, stimulates fivefold expression 5.4-kb mRNA species MH1C1 cell line; stimulation carbohydrate-independent. hepatoma cell lines mimic, therefore, effect cyclic AMP inhibition vivo expression genes encoding glycolytic lipogenic enzymes [Vaulont, S. et al. (1984) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 125, 135-147]. contrast, effect carbohydrates [Munnich, A. et al. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10228-10231] undetectable. insulin sensitivity liver-specific genes conserved 5.4-kb mRNA species only, especially MH1C1 cell line, investigated mRNAs, seems reflect fundamental difference vivo effect insulin genes. Finally, S1 nuclease mapping start-site pyruvate kinase L gene transcription shows normal site used vivo also used Fao Faza lines while, MH1C1 line, coexists multiple aberrant upstream initiation sites.
