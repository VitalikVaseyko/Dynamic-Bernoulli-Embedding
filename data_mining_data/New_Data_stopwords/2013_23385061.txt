 Tylophorine, phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid, major medicinal constituent herb Tylophora indica. Tylophorine treatment increased accumulation c-Jun protein, component activator protein 1 (AP1), carcinoma cells. vitro kinase assay revealed resultant c-Jun phosphorylation primarily mediated via activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). Moreover, flow cytometry indicated ectopically overexpressed c-Jun conjunction tylophorine significantly increased number carcinoma cells arrested G1 phase. tylophorine-mediated downregulation cyclin A2 protein levels known involved primary G1 arrest. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reporter assays revealed tylophorine enhanced c-Jun downregulation cyclin A2 promoter activity upon increased binding c-Jun deregulation AP1 site decreased binding upregulation activating transcription factor (ATF) site cyclin A2 promoter, thereby reducing cyclin A2 expression. Further, biochemical studies using pharmacological inhibitors RNA silencing approaches demonstrated tylophorine-mediated elevation c-Jun protein level occurs primarily via two discrete prolonged signaling pathways: (i) NF-kappaB/PKCdelta_(MKK4)_JNK cascade, phosphorylates c-Jun increases stability slowing ubiquitination, (ii) PI3K_PDK1_PP2A_eEF2 cascade, sustains eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) activity thus c-Jun protein translation. best knowledge, report first demonstrate involvement c-Jun anticancer activity tylophorine release c-Jun translation global translational blockade via PI3K_PDK1_eEF2 signaling cascade.
