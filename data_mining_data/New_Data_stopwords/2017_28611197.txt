 Purpose: identify effective metabolic inhibitors suppress aggressive growth pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), explored vivo antitumor efficacy metabolic inhibitors, single agents, panel patient-derived PDAC xenograft models (PDX) investigated whether genomic alterations tumors correlate sensitivity metabolic inhibitors.Experimental Design: Mice established PDAC tumors 6 13 individual PDXs randomized treated, daily 4 weeks, either sterile PBS (vehicle) glutaminase inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate (AOA), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA), autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), mitochondrial complex inhibitor phenformin/metformin.Results: Among agents tested, phenformin showed significant tumor growth inhibition (>30% compared vehicle) 5 12 individual PDXs. Metformin, fivefold higher dose, displayed significant tumor growth inhibition 3 12 PDXs similar BPTES (2/8 PDXs) DCA (2/6 PDXs). AOA CQ lowest response rates. Gene set enrichment analysis conducted using baseline gene expression profile pancreatic tumors identified gene expression signature inversely correlated phenformin sensitivity, agreement phenformin gene expression signature NIH Library Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). PDXs sensitive phenformin showed baseline reduction amino acids elevation oxidized glutathione. correlation phenformin response genetic alterations KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, PTENConclusions: Phenformin treatment showed relatively higher antitumor efficacy established PDAC tumors, compared efficacy metabolic inhibitors metformin. Phenformin treatment significantly diminished PDAC tumor progression prolonged tumor doubling time. Overall, results serve foundation evaluation phenformin therapeutic agent pancreatic cancer.
