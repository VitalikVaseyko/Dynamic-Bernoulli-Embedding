 study designed test hypothesis myopathic component myasthenia gravis. Serum enzyme analyses lactate pyruvate assays undertaken exercise order detect possible leakage defective muscle membrane. patient control group exercised (1) aerobic conditions, (2) ischaemic conditions, (3) aerobic conditions influence edrophonium chloride. patient group showed higher resting level lactate aerobic state controls. addition, average change SGOT values patient group one minute aerobic exercise influence edrophonium chloride exceeded control group. findings suggest possible leakage enzyme metabolite myasthenic muscle due membrane defect support hypothesis may myopathic component myasthenia gravis. However, two groups showed significant differences CPK values, often elevated primary muscle diseases.
