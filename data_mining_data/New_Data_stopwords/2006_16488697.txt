 BACKGROUND: Cardioplegic arrest reperfusion myocardium imposes oxidative stress could potentially inactivate metabolic enzymes compromise energy production. study determined impact cardioplegic arrest reperfusion activities several oxidant-sensitive enzymes, tested whether pyruvate, natural metabolic fuel antioxidant, mitigates oxidant stress, protects enzymes, bolsters myocardial energy state reperfusion. METHODS: situ swine hearts arrested 60 minutes 4:1 blood:crystalloid cardioplegia, reperfused 3 minutes cardioplegia-free blood without approximately 12 mM pyruvate. Tissue metabolites enzyme activities measured left ventricular myocardium snap frozen 45 minutes arrest 3 minutes reperfusion. RESULTS: 8-isoprostane content, measure lipid peroxidation, sharply increased upon reperfusion, coincident 70% decline redox state intracellular antioxidant glutathione. Aconitase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities fell arrest; creatine kinase phosphofructokinase inactivated upon reperfusion. Pyruvate suppressed 8-isoprostane formation, maintained glutathione redox state, enhanced phosphocreatine phosphorylation potential, measure myocardial energy state, reperfusion. Pyruvate reactivated creatine kinase aconitase, least partially mitochondrial enzymes, protect cytosolic enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphofructokinase. CONCLUSIONS: Administration pyruvate upon reperfusion cardioplegic arrest mitigates oxidative stress, protects mitochondrial enzymes increases myocardial energy state. results support therapeutic application pyruvate-enhanced reperfusion prevent cardiac injury cardioplegic arrest.
