 Mammalian liver mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, polypeptide 160 kDa, activated allosterically N-acetyl-L-glutamate. analogue activator N-(chloroacetyl)-L-[14C]glutamate found serve photoaffinity label enzyme. specificity demonstrated drastic reduction radioactivity bound protein (a) excess unlabeled acetylglutamate present irradiation (b) enzyme replaced pyruvate kinase, enzyme affected acetylglutamate. labeling due photoactivation chloroacetyl group since labeling equal conditions acetyl[14C]glutamate. localize binding site, limited proteolysis used. Trypsin cleaves carbamoyl phosphate synthetase complementary NH2- COOH-terminal fragments 140 20 kDa, respectively [Powers-Lee, S. G., & Corina, K. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15349-15352], latter found labeled. Similarly, various fragments generated elastase, two, 20 120 kDa, contain COOH terminus [see Powers-Lee Corina (1986) above] found labeled. Thus, binding site acetylglutamate within 20 kDa COOH terminus. excludes possibility acetylglutamate binding site evolved ancestral substrate site glutamine: substrate binds small subunit Escherichia coli enzyme, homologous NH2-terminal domain rat liver enzyme. Exhaustive tryptic digestion photolabeled carbamoyl phosphate synthetase yielded single radioactive peak, suggesting labeling restricted single minimal tryptic peptide.
