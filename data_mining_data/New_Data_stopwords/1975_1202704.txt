 hydrophobic nature proteins characterized degree 2-p-toluidinonaphthalene-6-sulphonate (TNS) affinity pronounced quantitatively semi-saturated (C1/2) concentrations. index correlates directly position TNS emission maximum binding proteins reversely yield fluorescence. preparations phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, xantinoxidase, glyceratekinase, lysozyme, RNase long (1-2 h) contact TNS change values C1/2, evidences interaction hydrophobic indicator new structures protein molecule change nature linkage itself. attempt made characterize accessible TNS hydrophobic nature individual proteins coefficient molar hydrophobic nature unites three mentioned characteristics. Serum albumin, insulin, glucogon, alpha chemotrypsin, DNase hydrophobic, pyruvate kinase, aldolase, urease, RNase--least hydrophobic, Glycerate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, xanthinoxidase, trypsin, lysozyme intermediate position.
