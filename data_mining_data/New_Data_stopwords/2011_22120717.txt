 P53 important role processing starvation signals. P53-dependent molecular mediators Warburg effect reduce glucose consumption promote mitochondrial function. therefore hypothesized retention wild-type p53 characteristic primary glioblastomas limits metabolic demands induced deregulated signal transduction presence hypoxia nutrient depletion. report short hairpin RNA-mediated gene suppression wild-type p53 ectopic expression mutant temperature-sensitive dominant-negative p53(V135A) increased glucose consumption lactate production, decreased oxygen consumption enhanced hypoxia-induced cell death p53 wild-type human glioblastoma cells. Similarly, genetic knockout p53 HCT116 colon carcinoma cells resulted reduced respiration hypersensitivity towards hypoxia-induced cell death. Further, wild-type p53 gene silencing reduced expression synthesis cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2), effector necessary respiratory chain function. SCO2 transgene reverted metabolic phenotype restored resistance towards hypoxia p53-depleted p53 mutant glioma cells rotenone-sensitive manner, demonstrating effect dependent intact oxidative phosphorylation. Supplementation methyl-pyruvate, mitochondrial substrate, rescued p53 wild-type p53 mutant cells hypoxic cell death, demonstrating p53-mediated selective aptitude metabolize mitochondrial substrates. Further, SCO2 gene silencing p53 wild-type glioma cells sensitized cells towards hypoxia. Finally, lentiviral gene suppression SCO2 significantly enhanced tumor necrosis subcutaneous HCT116 xenograft tumor model, compatible impaired energy metabolism cells. findings demonstrate glioma colon cancer cells p53 wild-type status skew Warburg effect thereby reduce vulnerability towards tumor hypoxia SCO2-dependent manner. Targeting SCO2 may therefore represent valuable strategy enhance sensitivity towards hypoxia may complement strategies targeting glucose metabolism.
