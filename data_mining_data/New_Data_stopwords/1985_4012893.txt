 effects ultrasound rates catalytic reactions four purified enzymes vitro extensively investigated wide range biochemical physical exposure conditions. general, concluded therapeutic intensities continuous wave 0.88 MHz ultrasound detectable direct effects rates reactions catalysed creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase pyruvate kinase. minor effects noted. were: indirect effect resulting mixing within sample chamber caused quartz wind streaming; effect partially-hydrated cross-linked enzyme systems appears result increased fluid penetration solid matrix presence ultrasound; increase rate spontaneous dissociation multimeric enzyme system. is, therefore, concluded direct interaction ultrasound catalytic functioning individual enzyme molecules unlikely primary step acousto-biological interaction, primary interaction appears occurring higher level organizational complexity.
