 GNE Myopathy (GNEM) neuromuscular disorder caused mutations GNE gene. slowly progressive distal proximal muscle weakness sparing quadriceps. study, applied model mutated M743T GNE enzyme skeletal muscle-cultured myoblasts paired healthy controls depict pattern signaling proteins controlling survival and/or apoptosis PI3K/AKT, BCL2, ARTS/XIAP pathways, examined effects metabolic changes/stimuli expression activation, potential role GNEM. Immunoblot analysis GNEM myoblasts indicated notable increased level activated PTEN PDK1 trend relative differences expression activation examined signaling molecules variability among cultures. ANOVA analysis showed highly significant interaction level PTEN patients groups. parallel, interaction level BCL2, BAX PTEN specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor-LY294002 highly significant BCL2 nearly significant PTEN BAX. pattern ARTS/XIAP signaling proteins GNEM paired controls variable, significant differences two cell types. response GNEM cells metabolic changes/stimuli: serum depletion insulin challenge, indicated expression selected signaling proteins, variable similar control cells. Taken together, observations provide clearer insight specific signaling molecules influencing growth survival GNEM muscle cells.
