 Using combination vivo vitro studies, investigated impact polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) expression several genes encoding proteins involved hepatic glycolysis lipogenesis. Meal-training rats high glucose diet containing 10% triolein led significant induction hepatic mRNAs encoding glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK), fatty acid synthase (FAS), malic enzyme (ME), S14 protein (S14), effect thyroid hormone receptor-beta 1 (TR beta 1) c/EBP alpha gene expression. Replacing triolein menhaden oil attenuated (by 50-90%) induction mRNA encoding GK, ME, PK, FAS, S14. effect rapid (within hours) FAS S14, directed transcriptional level. mRNAs encoding TR beta 1, c/EBP alpha beta-actin unaffected menhaden oil. Studies cultured primary hepatocytes showed C18:3,omega 3 (n-3), C18:3,omega 6 (n-6), C20:4, omega 6 (n-6), C20:5,omega 3 (n-3) equally effective suppressing level mRNAs encoding FAS, S14, PK. effect specific glycolytic lipogenic enzymes, expression beta-actin affected fatty acids. Moreover, fatty acids marginal effects cell viability judged lactate dehydrogenase release. data indicate polyunsaturated fatty acids coordinately regulate expression several enzymes involved carbohydrate lipid metabolism. mechanism control require extrahepatic factors fatty acid metabolism.
