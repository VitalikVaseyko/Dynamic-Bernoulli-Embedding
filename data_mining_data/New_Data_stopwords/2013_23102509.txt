 Asiatic acid (AA), triterpenoid derivative Centella asiatica, shown significant biological effects antioxidant anti-inflammatory activities. Aim investigation evaluate antihyperglycemic effect AA activities hepatic enzymes carbohydrate metabolism streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. induce diabetes mellitus, rats injected streptozotocin intraperitoneally single dose 40 mg/kg b.w. Diabetic rats showed significant (p<0.05) increased plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin significant (p<0.05) decreased circulating insulin hemoglobin. altered activities key enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase carbohydrate metabolism significantly (p<0.05) increased whereas hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glycogen content significantly (p<0.05) decreased liver diabetic rats also increased activities aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Oral administration AA (5, 10 20 mg/kg b.w.) glibenclamide (600 mug/kg b.w.) diabetic rats 45 days prevented alteration reverted near normalcy. Protection body weight loss diabetic rats AA also observed. significant effect observed normal rats treated AA (20 mg/kg b.w.). search, AA found potential bioactive compound regulate carbohydrate metabolism modulating key regulatory enzymes diabetic rats. findings merit research field.
