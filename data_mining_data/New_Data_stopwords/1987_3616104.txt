 activities several enzymes glucose metabolism (glycolytic tricarboxylic acid pathways) four different regions rat brain (cerebellum, medulla oblongata pons, cerebral cortex diencephalon) studied. Statistical differences found activities enzymes analyzed four regions, except case soluble hexokinase pyruvate kinase. changes observed citrate synthase activity may account physiological differences areas related myelin formation energy metabolism. Cerebral cortex diencephalon showed enzyme activities generally greater cerebellum medulla oblongata pons. results obtained lend support concept differential energy metabolism brain regions.
