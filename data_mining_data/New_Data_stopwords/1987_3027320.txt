 Intact periportal (pp) perivenous (pv) hepatocytes prepared digitonin-collagenase liver perfusion. degree separation indicated significant differences pp pv cells activity pp markers, alanine aminotransferase (pp/pv = 2.1), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (3.4) lactate dehydrogenase (1.3), pv markers, glutamate dehydrogenase (0.73) pyruvate kinase (0.81). pattern altered 3-day pretreatment phenobarbital (PB). hepatocytes isolated pv area contained higher activities microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase, cytosolic glutathione transferase. Cytochrome P-450 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase slightly higher pv cells. Treatment PB induced NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, glutathione transferase, cytochrome P-450 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase degree induction found least strong pp cells pv cells. induction 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase clearly prominent pp cells. hand, PB reduced activities benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase alcohol dehydrogenase cell types. results demonstrate direct enzyme assay separated cells dominance pv-region metabolizing drugs normal liver. Contrary several studies, however, data indicate induction PB occurs panacinarily, i.e., relatively pp region, thus diminishing rather exaggerating original pv dominance.
