 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Aberrant activation AKT oncogenic pathway downregulation Sprouty 2 (Spry2) tumor suppressor gene frequently observed molecular events human hepatocarcinogenesis. goal present study investigate eventual biochemical genetic crosstalk activated AKT inactivation Spry2 liver cancer development using vivo vitro approaches. METHODS: Activated AKT and/or Spry2Y55F, dominant negative form Spry2, overexpressed mouse liver via hydrodynamic gene delivery. Histological biochemical assays applied characterize molecular features AKT AKT/Spry2Y55F liver tumors. human HLE hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, stably overexpressing AKT, transfected Spry2Y55F study molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocarcinogenesis driven Spry2 loss. RESULTS: Spry2Y55F overexpression significantly accelerated AKT-induced hepatocarcinogenesis mouse. AKT/Spry2Y55F liver lesions increased proliferation glycolysis decreased lipogenesis compared AKT corresponding lesions. molecular level, AKT/Spry2Y55F HCCs exhibited significantly stronger induction activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) pathways AKT corresponding lesions. phenotype reproduced HLE cells overexpressing AKT following transfection Spry2Y55F. Furthermore, found concomitant suppression MAPK cascade PKM2 strongly inhibited growth induced Spry2Y55F AKT-overexpressing cells. CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation Spry2 accelerates AKT-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via activation MAPK PKM2 pathways.
