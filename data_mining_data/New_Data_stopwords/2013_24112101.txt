 Cancer cells require glucose support rapid growth process known aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect. ovarian cancer cells, increased metabolic activity glucose concentration linked aggressiveness cancer. However, unclear whether targeting glycolytic pathway may kill malignant cells likely broad therapeutic implications ovarian cancer metastasis. present research, found EF24, HIF-1alpha inhibitor, could significantly block glucose uptake, rate glycolysis, lactate production compared vehicle treatment SKOV-3, A2780 OVCAR-3 cells. results might possibly contribute observation EF24 could inhibit ovarian cancer cell migration invasion wound healing Transwell assays. Furthermore, important mediator glucose metabolism, glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) found contribute function EF24 energy metabolism metastasis. examine effect EF24 mediated role Glut1 vivo xenograph subcutaneous tumor model, intraperitoneal metastasis lung metastasis model introduced. results indicated EF24 treatment could inhibit tumor growth, intraperitoneal metastasis lung metastasis SKOV-3 cells, Glut1 possible mediator role EF24. conclusion, results highlight anti-cancer reagent inhibiting effect energy metabolism could inhibit metastasis, EF24 possible candidate anti-metastasis therapeutic applications ovarian cancer.
