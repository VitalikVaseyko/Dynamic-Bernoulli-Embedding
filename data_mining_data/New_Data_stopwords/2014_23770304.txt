 studied PK-LR gene 10 unrelated Indian patients congenital haemolytic anemia associated erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency. patients variable presentation ranging mild compensated hemolysis severe anemia. Nine different mutations detected among 20 mutated alleles identified: one deletion (c.1042-1044del) p.Lys348del eight single-nucleotide (nt) substitutions resulting amino acid exchanges c.397A>G (p.Asn133Asp), c.992A>G (p.Asp331Gly), c.1072G>A (p.Gly358Arg), c.1076G>A (p.Arg359His), c.1219G>A (p.Glu407Lys), c.1241C>T (p.Pro414Leu), c.1436G>A (p.Arg479His) c.1529G>A (p.Arg510Gln) identified. Although exons, flanking regions promoter region sequenced cases, failed detect second expected mutation two subjects. Two mutations [c.397A>G; c.1241C>T] novel. novel missense mutations involved highly conserved amino acids. Two mutations identified first time homozygous state globally (c1042-1044del; c.1072G>A) two mutations identified first time population (c.1076G>A; c.1529G>A). study along earlier report suggests frequent mutations India would appear c.1436G>A (18.33%), followed c.992A>G (11.66%) c.1456C>T (11.66%). Structural implications amino acid substitutions correlated clinical phenotypes seen.
