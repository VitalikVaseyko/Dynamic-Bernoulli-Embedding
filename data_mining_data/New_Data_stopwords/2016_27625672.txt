 Plants, sessile organisms, exposed widely varying environmental conditions throughout life cycle. Compatible plant-microbe interactions favor plant growth development, help plants deal environmental challenges. Microorganisms produce diverse range elicitor molecules establish symbiotic relationships plants associate with, given ecological niche. Lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) Thuricin 17 (Th17) two compounds shown positively influence plant growth legumes non-legumes. Arabidopsis thaliana responded positively treatment bacterial signal compounds LCO Th17 presence salt stress (up 250 mM NaCl). Shotgun proteomics unstressed 250 mM NaCl stressed A. thaliana rosettes (7 days post stress) combination LCO Th17 revealed many known, putative, hypothetical, unknown proteins. Overall, carbon energy metabolic pathways affected unstressed salt stressed conditions treated signals. PEP carboxylase, Rubisco-oxygenase large subunit, pyruvate kinase, proteins photosystems II noteworthy proteins enhanced signals, along stress related proteins. findings suggest proteome A. thaliana rosettes altered bacterial signals tested, salt stress, thereby imparting positive effect plant growth high salt stress. roles identified proteins discussed relation salt stress adaptation, which, translated field grown crops crucial component significant importance agriculture global food production. mass spectrometry proteomics data deposited ProteomeXchange identifier PXD004742.
