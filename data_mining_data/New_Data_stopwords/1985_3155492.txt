 Acceleration glycolysis is, general, characteristic neoplasia. Previous studies shown increase glycolysis achieved quantitative increases activities key regulatory enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase (PFK) and/or pyruvate kinase, often accompanied isozymic alterations facilitate glycolysis. study, investigated alterations activity, isozymic profile, kinetic-regulatory properties PFK medullary thyroid carcinomas rat, represent model neuroectodermally derived tumors humans. Contrary expected, found undifferentiated tumors showed decrease enzyme activity compared highly differentiated tumors. decrease PFK activity accompanied increase expression liver-type isozyme PFK. enzymes 2 tumor types showed significant differences affinity cooperativity toward substrates, fructose 6-phosphate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). However, tumor PFKs showed major differences respect behavior toward allosteric regulators enzymes, ATP, citrate, fructose 2,6-diphosphate; latter recently discovered activator enzyme. enzyme undifferentiated tumor less sensitive citrate inhibition, readily reversed cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. addition, less sensitive ATP inhibition low fructose 6-phosphate concentrations. importantly, enzyme undifferentiated tumors sensitive activation fructose 2,6-diphosphate especially inhibited citrate ATP. altered regulatory properties enzyme undifferentiated tumors probably reflect altered isozymic composition, i.e., increase liver-type isozyme. preferential expression liver-type isozyme undifferentiated rapidly replicating cancer cells may explained terms unique regulatory properties isozyme. Although concentrations fructose 2,6-diphosphate comparable 2 tumor types, higher sensitivity liver-type PFK activation compound may permit accelerated glycolytic flux observed undifferentiated tumors, despite decrease total PFK activity.
