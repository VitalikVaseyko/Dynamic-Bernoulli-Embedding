 Resveratrol, ubiquitous stress-induced phytoalexin, demonstrated wide variety biological activities make good candidate treatment diabetes mellitus. present study aimed evaluate therapeutic potential assaying activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats. daily oral treatment resveratrol (5 mg/kg body weight) diabetic rats 30 days demonstrated significant (p<0.05) decline blood glucose glycosylated hemoglobin levels significant (p<0.05) increase plasma insulin level. altered activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase liver kidney tissues diabetic rats significantly (p<0.05) reverted near normal levels administration resveratrol. Further, resveratrol administration diabetic rats improved hepatic glycogen content suggesting antihyperglycemic potential resveratrol diabetic rats. obtained results compared glyclazide, standard oral hypoglycemic drug. Thus, modulatory effects resveratrol attenuating enzymes activities afford promise widespread use treatment diabetes future.
