 age changes 2,3-DPG concentration, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase, hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities pigs erythroid cells first 10 days birth investigated study mechanism blood oxygen-transport function regulation early stages postnatal adaptation. established, age peculiarities young, mature old erythrocytes metabolism piglets transition postnatal development. shown rise 2,3-DPG, allosteric effector hemoglobin oxygen affinity level, due increased activities 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase hexokinase birth, particularly characteristic young pigs erythrocytes.
