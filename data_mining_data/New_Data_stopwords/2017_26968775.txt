 Trypanosoma evansi monomorphic protist infect horses animal species economic importance man. Like bloodstream form closely related species Trypanosoma brucei, T. evansi depends exclusively glycolysis free-energy generation. T. evansi kinetoplastid organisms, enzymes major part glycolytic pathway present within organelles called glycosomes, authentic specialized peroxisomes. Since T. evansi undergo stage-dependent differentiations, occurs bloodstream forms, assumed metabolic pattern parasite identical bloodstream form T. brucei. However, report presence two additional enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase PPi-dependent pyruvate phosphate dikinase T. evansi glycosomes. colocalization glycolytic enzymes within glycosomes parasite reported before. enzymes make use PEP contributing production ATP within organelles. activity enzymes T. evansi glycosomes drastically changes model assumed oxidation glucose parasite.
