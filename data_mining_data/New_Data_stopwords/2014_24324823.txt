 Coffee one world's traded agricultural products. Modeling studies predicted climate change strong impact suitability current cultivation areas, studies anticipated possible mitigating effects elevated atmospheric [CO2] information exists coffee plant. Potted plants two genotypes Coffea arabica one C. canephora grown controlled conditions irradiance (800 mumol m(-2) s(-1)), RH (75%) 380 700 muL CO2 L(-1) 1 year, without water, nutrient root development restrictions. genotypes, high [CO2] treatment promoted opposite trends stomatal density size, decreased increased, respectively. Regardless genotype growth [CO2], net rate CO2 assimilation increased (34-49%) measured 700 380 muL CO2 L(-1). result, together almost unchanged stomatal conductance, led instantaneous water use efficiency increase. results also showed reinforcement photosynthetic (and respiratory) components, namely thylakoid electron transport activities RuBisCo, ribulose 5-phosphate kinase, malate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, may contributed enhancements maximum rates electron transport, carboxylation photosynthetic capacity elevated [CO2], although responses genotype dependent. photosystem II efficiency, energy driven photochemical events, non-structural carbohydrates, photosynthetic pigment membrane permeability respond [CO2] supply. alterations total fatty acid content unsaturation level chloroplast membranes noted but, apparently, affect photosynthetic functioning. Despite differences among genotypes, clear species-dependent responses elevated [CO2] observed. Overall, apparent sign photosynthetic down-regulation found, data suggest Coffea spp. plants may successfully cope high [CO2] present experimental conditions.
