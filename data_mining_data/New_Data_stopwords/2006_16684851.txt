 energy-requiring organ body, cardiac muscle, relies primarily lipoprotein-derived fatty acids. Prenatal loss cardiac lipoprotein lipase (LPL) leads hypertriglyceridemia, cardiac dysfunction, young mice. Cardiac specific loss LPL 8-wk-old mice produced 2-wk tamoxifen treatment MerCreMer (MCM)/Lpl(flox/flox) mice. LPL gene deletion confirmed PCR analysis, LPL mRNA expression reduced approximately 70%. One week tamoxifen completed, triglyceride increased LPL deletion, 162 +/- 53 vs. 91 +/- 21 mg/dl, P < 0.01. Tamoxifen treatment Lpl(flox/flox) mice cause significant increase triglyceride levels. Four weeks tamoxifen, MCM/Lpl(flox/flox) mice triglyceride levels 190 +/- 27 mg/dl, similar mice prenatal LPL deletion. One week tamoxifen, MCM/Lpl(flox/flox), Lpl(flox/flox), mice decreases carnitine palmitoyl transferase mRNA (18%) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA (38%). changes gene expression became robust time. Acute loss LPL decreased ejection fraction increased mRNA levels atrial natriuretic factor. studies show acute loss LPL produced leads rapid alteration gene expression cardiac dysfunction.
