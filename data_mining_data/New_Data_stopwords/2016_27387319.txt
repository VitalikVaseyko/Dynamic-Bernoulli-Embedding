 present study examines effect sustained exercise glycolysis fatty acids oxidation swimming muscles liver juvenile tinfoil barb (Barbonymus schwanenfeldii). subjects divided one control group (water current speed 0.0 bl s(-1), body length per second) two training groups (1.0 2.0 bl s(-1)), respectively. Results showed glycolysis stimulated high-speed training white muscle, accompanied significantly increased activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, reduction glycogen contents training groups (P < 0.05). contrary, extreme fatty acids oxidation observed red muscle high-speed training group, showed significant reduction crude lipid content significant increase activities hormone-sensitive lipase, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cytochrome C oxidase 2.0 bl s(-1) group (P < 0.05). addition, saturated fatty acids red muscle monounsaturated fatty acids white muscle used preferentially sustained training, respectively. Furthermore, glycogen content within liver also significantly reduced increasing training intensities (P < 0.05). results suggested glycogen fatty acids used fuel support sustained swimming two functional muscles B. schwanenfeldii, higher glycolysis fatty acids oxidation seen white red muscles high-speed swimming, respectively. Furthermore, hepatic glycogen played important role supply energy sustained training periods B. schwanenfeldii.
