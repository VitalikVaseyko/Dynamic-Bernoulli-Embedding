 simplified method described enzymatic synthesis purification [alpha-32P]ribo- deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. products obtained greater 97% radiochemical purity yields 50--70% (relative 32Pi) two-step elution DEAE-Sephadex. reactions done one vessel need intermediate product purifications. method therefore suitable synthesis radioactive compounds relatively large scale. sequential steps method involve first synthesis [gamma-32P]ATP subsequent phosphorylation nucleoside 3' monophosphate T4 polynucleotide kinase yield nucleoside 3', [5'-32P]diphosphate. Hexokinase used T4 reaction remove remaining [gamma-32P]ATP. Nucleoside 3',[5'-32P]diphosphate treated nuclease P-1 produce nucleoside [5'-32P]monophosphate phosphorylated [alpha-32P]nucleoside triphosphate pyruvate kinase nucleoside monophosphate kinase. Adenosine triphosphate used phosphate donor [alpha-32P]deoxynucleoside triphosphate syntheses readily removed second purification step involving affinity chromatography boronate-polyacrylamide. [alpha-32P]Ribonucleoside triphosphates similarly purified deoxyadenosine triphosphate used phosphate donor.
