 Cardiac energy metabolism determinant response hypertrophic stimuli. investigate responds physiological pathological stimuli, compared energetic status models hypertrophy induced physiological stimuli (pregnancy treadmill running) pathological stimulus (spontaneously hypertensive rats, SHR) 15 week-old female rats, leading 10% cardiac hypertrophy. Late stage compensated hypertrophy also studied 25 week-old SHR (35% hypertrophy). Markers cardiac remodelling follow unique pattern expression: trained rats, ANF increased; gravid rats, calcineurin activation BNP expression reduced beta-MHC expression enhanced; markers clearly up-regulated 25 week-old SHR. Respiration permeabilized fibers revealed 17% increase oxidative capacity trained rats only. Mitochondrial enzyme activities, expression master regulator PGC-1alpha mitochondrial transcription factor A, content mitochondrial DNA consistently changed, suggesting compensated hypertrophy involve alterations mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondrial fatty acid utilization tended increase trained rats decreased 14% 15 week-old SHR. Expression markers lipid oxidation, PPARalpha down-stream targets MCAD CPTI, up-regulated training tended decrease gravid 15 week-old SHR rats. Taken together results show univocal pattern cardiac adaptation response physiological pathological hypertrophic stimuli, suggesting factors could play role determining adaptation energy metabolism increased workload.
