 Liver X receptors (LXR) alpha beta play important role regulating expression genes involved hepatic bile fatty acid synthesis, glucose metabolism, well sterol efflux. Studies human embryonic kidney 293 cells indicate unsaturated fatty acids interfere oxysterols binding LXR antagonize oxysterol-induced LXRalpha activity. report, evaluated effects unsaturated fatty acids LXR-regulated hepatic gene expression. LXR agonist, T1317, induced mRNAs encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) two SREBP-1c-regulated lipogenic genes, e.g. fatty-acid synthase S14 protein primary hepatocytes. Treatment hepatocytes eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) suppressed mRNAs absence presence T1317. cis-regulatory elements targeted T1317 required fatty-acid suppression FAS S14 promoter activity. contrast SREBP-1-regulated lipogenic genes, 20:5n-3 effect T1317 induction ABCG5 ABCG8 rat hepatoma cell line, FTO-2B. two genes require LXR SREBP-1c expression. Feeding rats diet supplemented fish oil suppressed hepatic SREBP-1c-regulated genes induced PPARalpha-regulated genes effect LXR-regulated transcripts, CYP7A1, ABCG5, ABCG8. Transfection studies, using either full-length hLXRalpha chimera containing LXRalpha ligand binding domain, indicate wide array unsaturated fatty acids little effect LXRalpha activity primary hepatocytes FTO-2B. studies suggest LXRalpha target unsaturated fatty acid regulation primary rat hepatocytes liver. Thus, oxysterol/LXR-mediated regulation transcripts involved bile acid synthesis sterol efflux appear insensitive dietary unsaturated fatty acids. unsaturated fatty acid suppression SREBP-1 targeted lipogenic genes independent LXRalpha
