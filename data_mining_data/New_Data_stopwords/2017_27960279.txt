 Resveratrol (Res), natural phytoalexin found variety plants, significant antitumor activity. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) abnormally high expression various tumor cells, implicated survival tumors. However, whether Res inhibits PKM2 expression poorly understood. present study, found treatment Res inhibited cell proliferation induced cell apoptosis. IC50 values Res DLD1, HeLa, MCF-7 cells 75 +/- 4.54, 50 +/- 3.65, 50 +/- 3.32 muM, respectively. elucidate mechanisms underlying antitumor activities, serial experiments performed. Results showed reduction PKM2 expression tumor cells Res treatment increased expression ER stress mitochondrial fission proteins reduced cell viability levels fusion proteins. phenomena reversed artificial overexpression PKM2. Quantitative analyses showed expression microRNA-326 (miR-326) increased upon Res treatment. Treatment miR-326 mimic reduced PKM2 expression, promoting recovery ER stress mitochondrial fission. Overall, results demonstrate miR-326/PKM2-mediated ER stress mitochondrial dysfunction participate apoptosis induced Res. results provide novel insight molecular mechanisms Res suppresses tumors support use Res antitumor drug.
