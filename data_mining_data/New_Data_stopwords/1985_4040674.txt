 action properties cathepsin D, partly purified unfertilized loach eggs, embryos skeletal muscles determined. enzyme embryo cells displays activity maximum pH 3.0 pH 4.8 enzyme skeletal muscles--only pH 3.0. Cathepsin purified three sources splits actively hemoglobin, albumin, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase practically influence casein, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. enzyme comparatively thermolabile activity decreases presence thiol compounds. main part cathepsin skeletal muscle cells embryo cells precipitated differential centrifugation homogenates (25000 g; 60 min).
