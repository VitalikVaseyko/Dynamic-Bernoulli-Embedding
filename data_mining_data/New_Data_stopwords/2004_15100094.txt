 Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) rat homolog human Williams-Beuren syndrome region 14 member basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor family. activation found inducible carbohydrate liver nuclear extracts rats fed high-sucrose diet. ChREBP able bind carbohydrate response element promoter L-type pyruvate kinase initiate gene transcription. detailed expression profile transcriptional regulation ChREBP gene adipocytes characterized. present study, provide evidence showing 1) ChREBP gene expressed differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes rat adipose tissue; 2) insulin, glucose, antidiabetic agent troglitazone significantly upregulate gene expression ChREBP 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas free fatty acids suppress expression cell type; 3) fasting followed refeeding high-carbohydrate diet resulted 10-fold increase ChREBP mRNA level rat adipose tissue; 4) ChREBP expression adipose tissue significantly affected diabetic state. Taken together, results present consistent idea ChREBP important modulator adipocyte biology expression adipose tissue subject combined regulation glucose insulin vivo. induction ChREBP may serve novel pharmacological pathway troglitazone-mediated hypoglycemic effects vivo.
