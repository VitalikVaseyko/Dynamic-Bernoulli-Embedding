 Innate immune memory, trained immunity, recently described important property cells innate immune system. Due increased interest important new field immunological investigation, sought determine optimal conditions vitro experimental protocol monocyte training using three commonly used training stimuli literature: beta-glucan, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). investigated optimized protocol monocyte trained immunity induced initial training period beta-glucan, BCG, oxLDL, followed washing resting cells and, thereafter, restimulation secondary bacterial stimuli. training resting time intervals varied identify optimal setting long-term induction trained immunity. Trained immunity assessed terms secondary cytokine response, production reactive oxygen species, cell morphology, induction glycolysis. Monocytes primed beta-glucan, BCG, oxLDL showed increased pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine responses upon restimulation nonrelated stimuli. Also, three stimuli induced switch glycolysis (the Warburg effect). effects pronounced training interval 24 h resting time interval 6 days. Training BCG oxLDL also led increased production reactive oxygen species, whereas training beta-glucan led decreased production reactive oxygen species. describe optimal conditions vitro experimental model human primary monocytes study induction trained innate immunity microbial metabolic stimuli.
