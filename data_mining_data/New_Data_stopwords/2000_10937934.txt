 Modification glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity Lactococcus lactis undertaken batch fermentation lactose, adding various concentrations iodoacetate (IAA), compound specifically inhibits GAPDH low concentrations, culture medium. IAA concentration increased, GAPDH activity diminishes, provoking decrease glycolytic flux specific growth rate. control exerted level GAPDH due partially IAA covalent fixation also modified NADH/NAD+ ratio. mechanism inhibition NADH/NAD+ studied detail purified enzyme various kinetic parameters determined. Moreover, GAPDH activity became limiting, triose phosphate pool increased resulting inhibition pyruvate formate lyase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activated high NADH/NAD+ ratio. Thus, modifying GAPDH activity provokes shift mixed-acid homolactic metabolism, confirming important role enzyme controlling flux glycolysis orientation pyruvate catabolism.
