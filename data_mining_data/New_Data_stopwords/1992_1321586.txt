 standard resolution bovine kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase complex yields subcomplex composed approximately 60 dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2) subunits, approximately 6 protein X subunits, approximately 2 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase heterodimers (KcKb). Using preparation resolved kinase Kc much greater Kb, E2-X-KcKb subcomplex additionally bound least 15 catalytic subunits kinase (Kc) much lower level Kb. binding Kc E2 greatly enhanced kinase activity even high levels bound kinase. Free protein X, functional binding E3 component, bind E2-X-KcKb subcomplex. pattern binding Kc protein X unchanged either preparation E2 oligomer greatly reduced protein X subcomplex lipoyl domain protein X selectively removed. bound inner domain protein X associated latter subcomplex exchange free protein X. data support conclusion E2 subunits bind Kc subunit kinase suggest binding inner domain protein X inner domain transacetylase occurs assembly oligomeric core. Selective release fragment E2 subunits contain lipoyl domains (E2L fragment) releases kinase (M. Rahmatullah et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14,512-14,517). Sucrose gradient centrifugation yielded E2L-kinase fraction increased ratio kinase E2L fragment. monoclonal antibody specific E2L attached gel matrix. Binding E2L fragment also led specific binding kinase. Extensive washing reduce level bound kinase. Thus, kinase tightly bound lipoyl domain region E2.
