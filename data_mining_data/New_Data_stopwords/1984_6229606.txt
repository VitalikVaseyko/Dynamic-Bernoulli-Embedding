 Aluminum inhibited cytosolic mitochondrial hexokinase activities rat brain. IC50 values 4 9 microM. Aluminum effective mildly acidic (pH 6.8) slightly alkaline (pH 7.2-7.5) pH, presence physiological level magnesium (0.5 mM). However, saturating (8 mM) magnesium antagonized effect aluminum forms hexokinase activity. enzymes examined considerably less sensitive inhibition aluminum. IC50 aluminum phosphofructokinase 1.8 mM lactate dehydrogenase 0.4 mM. 10-600 microM, aluminum actually stimulated pyruvate kinase. Aluminum also inhibited lactate production rat brain extracts: effect much marked glucose substrate glucose-6-phosphate. However, IC50 inhibiting lactate production using glucose substrate 280 microM, higher required inhibit hexokinase. concentration aluminum comparable reportedly found brains patients died dialysis dementia brains patients died Alzheimer disease. Inhibition carbohydrate utilization may one mechanisms aluminum act neurotoxin.
