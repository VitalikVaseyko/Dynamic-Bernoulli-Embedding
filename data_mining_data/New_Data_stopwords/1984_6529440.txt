 mouse mutant pyruvate kinase (PK) hyperactivity found offspring 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated male mice. activity alteration detected blood could also found liver muscle, kidney, heart, spleen, lung, brain. Heterozygous mice erythrocyte PK activity enhanced 160% homozygotes 240%, compared homozygous wild types. mutation codominantly expressed. heterozygous homozygous mutants viable fully fertile show symptoms erythrocytosis. mutation affect heat stability, electrophoretic mobility, Km (for phosphoenolpyruvate) PK molecule. suggested regulatory locus PK-1 affected mutation. observations support also theory one structural locus erythrocyte liver isozymes.
