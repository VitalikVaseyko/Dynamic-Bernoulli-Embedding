 Glucose metabolism followed suspensions Saccharomyces cerevisiae using 13C NMR 14C radioactive labeling techniques Warburg manometer experiments. experiments performed cells grown various carbon sources growth medium, evaluate effect catabolite repression. rate glucose utilization conveniently determined 13C NMR experiments, measured concentration [1-13C]glucose, whereas distribution end products determined 13C 14C experiments. combining measurements flows various pathways contribute glucose catabolism estimated, effect oxygen upon glucose catabolism evaluated. measurements, Pasteur quotient (PQ) glucose catabolism calculated 2.95 acetate-grown cells 1.89 cells grown glucose saturation. Warburg experiments provided independent estimate glucose catabolism. PQ estimated Warburg experiments 2.9 acetate-grown cells excellent agreement labeled carbon experiments 4.6 cells grown saturation, agree. Possible explanations differences discussed. data estimate obtained net flow Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. backward flow fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2-ase) calculated "scrambling" 13C label [1-13C]glucose C1 C6 positions trehalose. Combining data allowed us calculate net flux phosphofructokinase (PFK). acetate-grown cells found relative flow PFK factor 1.7 faster anaerobically aerobically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
