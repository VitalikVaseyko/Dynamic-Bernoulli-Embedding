 BACKGROUND: number patients endometrial carcinoma (EmCa) advanced stage high histological grade increasing prognosis improved last decade. urgent need discovery novel molecular targets diagnosis, prognosis treatment EmCa, potential improve clinical strategy outcome disease. METHODOLOGY RESULTS: used "drill-down" proteomics approach facilitate identification novel molecular targets diagnosis, prognosis and/or therapeutic intervention EmCa. Based peptide ions identified retention times first LC-MS/MS analysis, exclusion list generated subsequent iterations. total 1529 proteins identified Proteinpilot(R) 5% error threshold seven sets iTRAQ experiments performed. average, second iteration added 78% new peptides identified first run, third iteration added 36% additional peptides. 1529 proteins identified, 40 satisfied criteria significant differential expression EmCa comparison normal proliferative tissues. proteins included metabolic enzymes (pyruvate kinase M2 lactate dehydrogenase A); calcium binding proteins (S100A6, calcyphosine calumenin), proteins involved regulating inflammation, proliferation invasion (annexin A1, interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3, alpha-1-antitrypsin, macrophage capping protein cathepsin B). Network analyses revealed regulation molecular targets c-myc, Her2/neu TNF alpha, suggesting intervention pathways may promising strategy development novel molecular targeted therapies EmCa. CONCLUSIONS: analyses revealed significance drill-down proteomics approach combination iTRAQ overcome limitations current proteomics strategies. study led identification number novel molecular targets therapeutic potential targeted molecular therapies endometrial carcinoma.
