 mammalian tissues, two types regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex described: end product inhibition acetyl CoA NADH: interconversion inactive phosphorylated form active nonphosphorylated form ATP requiring kinase specific phosphatase. article largely concerned latter type regulation complex adipose tissue insulin (and hormones) heart muscle lipid fuels. Effectors two interconverting enzymes include pyruvate ADP inhibit kinase, acetoin activates kinase Ca2+ Mg2+ activate phosphatase inhibit kinase. Evidence presented components pyruvate dehydrogenase complex including phosphatase kinase located within inner mitochondrial membrane. Direct measurements matrix concentration substrates effectors possible techniques presently available. key problem identification mechansims involved alterations pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed adipose tissue muscle. number indirect approaches used reviewed. hopeful recent finding laboratory adipose tissue heart muscle, differences activity pyruvate dehydrogenase intact tissue persist preparation subsequent incubation mitochondria.
