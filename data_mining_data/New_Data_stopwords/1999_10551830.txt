 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) suppress hepatic lipogenic gene transcription peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha)- cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism. Recently, sterol response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) implicated nutrient control lipogenic gene expression. report, assessed role SREBP1 plays PUFA control three hepatic genes, fatty acid synthase, L-pyruvate kinase (LPK), S14 protein (S14). PUFA suppressed hepatic mRNA(SREBP1) PPARalpha-independent mechanism well SREBP1c nuclear content (nSREBP1c, 65 kDa). Co-transfection primary hepatocytes revealed differential sensitivity fatty acid synthase, S14, LPK promoters nSREBP1c overexpression. three promoters examined, LPK least sensitive overexpressed nSREBP1c. Promoter deletion gel shift analyses S14 promoter localized functional SREBP1c cis-regulatory element E-box-like sequence ((-139)TCGCCTGAT(-131)) within S14 PUFA response region. Although overexpression nSREBP1c significantly reduced PUFA inhibition S14CAT, overexpression factors induced S14CAT activity, steroid receptor co-activator 1 retinoid X receptor alpha, effect S14CAT PUFA sensitivity. results suggest PUFA regulates hepatic nSREBP1c, factor functionally interacts S14 PUFA response region. PUFA regulation nSREBP1c may account PUFA-mediated suppression hepatic S14 gene transcription.
