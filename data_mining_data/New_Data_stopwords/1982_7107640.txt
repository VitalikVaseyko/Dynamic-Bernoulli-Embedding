 Control coenzyme synthesis studied isolated, perfused rat hearts. Pantothenic acid (PA), coenzyme A, intermediates pathway separated high pressure liquid chromatography. amount 14C label metabolites determined tissue extracts [14C]PA supplied perfusate. rate-controlling steps pathway determined measuring net rate [14C]PA flux reactions. data indicated primary site control pathway pantothenate kinase-catalyzed reaction, first intracellular step conversion PA CoA. rate reaction inhibited including glucose, pyruvate, fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate perfusate isolated hearts. Pyruvate beta-hydroxybutyrate caused much greater inhibition glucose. Insulin strong inhibitor, presence glucose. Insulin effect hearts receiving either substrate palmitate substrate. Collectively, data indicated unknown tissue metabolite whose level changed substrates insulin strong regulator pantothenate kinase. Synthesis CoA occurred cytosolic mitochondrial compartments. Accelerated mitochondrial CoA synthesis appeared dependent upon production accumulation 4'-phosphopantotheine, occurred pantothenate kinase stimulated.
