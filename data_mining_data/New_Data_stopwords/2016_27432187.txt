 Accurate diagnosis rare inherited anaemias challenging, requiring series complex expensive laboratory tests. Targeted next-generation-sequencing (NGS) used investigate disorders, selection genes individual panels narrow validation strategies used fallen short standards required clinical use. Clinical-grade validation negative results requires test distinguish lack adequate sequencing reads locations known mutations real absence mutations. achieve clinically-reliable diagnostic test minimize false-negative results developed open-source tool (CoverMi) accurately determine base-coverage 'discoverability' known mutations every sample. validated 33-gene panel using Sanger sequencing microarray. panel demonstrated 100% specificity 99.7% sensitivity. analysed 57 clinical samples: molecular diagnoses made 22/57 (38.6%), corresponding 32 mutations 16 new. cases, accurate molecular diagnosis positive impact clinical management. Using validated NGS-based platform routine molecular diagnosis previously undiagnosed congenital anaemias feasible clinical diagnostic setting, improves precise diagnosis enhances management counselling patient family.
