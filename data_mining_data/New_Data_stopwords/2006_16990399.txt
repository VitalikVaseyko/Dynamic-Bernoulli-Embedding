 exercise training cold acclimatization induce muscle remodelling vertebrates, producing aerobic phenotype. ectothermic species exercise training cold-acclimatization represent distinct stimuli. currently unclear stimuli act common mechanism different mechanisms lead common phenotype. goal study survey responses represent potential mechanisms responsible contraction- temperature-induced muscle remodelling, using ectothermic vertebrate. Separate groups adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) either swim trained cold acclimatized 4 weeks. found mitochondrial marker enzyme citrate synthase (CS) increased 1.5x cold 1.3x exercise (P<0.05). Cytochrome c oxidase (COx) increased 1.2x following exercise training (P<0.05) 1.2x (P=0.07) cold acclimatization. However, cold acclimatization increased beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) compared exercise-trained (by 1.3x) pyruvate kinase (PK) relative control zebrafish. assessed whole-animal performance outcomes treatments. Maximum absolute sustained swimming speed (Ucrit) increased exercise trained group cold acclimatized group. Real-time PCR analysis indicated increases CS primarily transcriptionally regulated exercise cold treatments. treatments showed increases nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-1 mRNA increased 2.3x cold-acclimatized 4x exercise-trained zebrafish controls. contrast, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha mRNA levels decreased experimental groups PPAR-beta1 declined exercise training only. Moreover, PPAR-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha mRNA changed either treatment. zebrafish, temperature exercise produce aerobic phenotype, stimulus-dependent responses (i.e. HOAD PK activities). similar changes NRF-1 mRNA suggest common responses might underlie aerobic muscle remodelling distinct changes (i.e. CS PPAR-beta1 mRNA) contribute specific temperature- exercise-induced phenotypes.
