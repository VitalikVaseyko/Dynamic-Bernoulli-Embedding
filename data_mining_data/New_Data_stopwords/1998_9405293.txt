 Tissue distribution kinetic parameters four isoenzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1, PDK2, PDK3 PDK4) identified thus far mammals analysed. appeared expression isoenzymes occurs tissue-specific manner. mRNA isoenzyme PDK1 found almost exclusively rat heart. mRNA PDK3 abundantly expressed rat testis. message PDK2 present tissues tested level low spleen lung. mRNA PDK4 predominantly expressed skeletal muscle heart. specific activities isoenzymes varied 25-fold, 50nmol/min per mg PDK2 1250nmol/min per mg PDK3. Apparent Ki values isoenzymes synthetic analogue pyruvate, dichloroacetate, varied 40-fold, 0.2 mM PDK2 8 mM PDK3. isoenzymes also different respect ability respond NADH NADH plus acetyl-CoA. NADH alone stimulated activities PDK1 PDK2 20 30% respectively. NADH plus acetyl-CoA activated isoenzymes nearly 200 300%. comparable conditions, isoenzyme PDK3 almost completely unresponsive NADH, NADH plus acetyl-CoA caused inhibition rather activation. Isoenzyme PDK4 activated almost 2-fold NADH, NADH plus acetyl-CoA activate level seen NADH alone. results provide first evidence unique tissue distribution kinetic characteristics isoenzymes PDK among major factors responsible tissue-specific regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity.
