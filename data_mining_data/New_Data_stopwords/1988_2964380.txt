 effects cold exposure T4 administration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, phosphofructokinase-2 pyruvate kinase activities examined rat brown adipose tissue. Cold adaptation (14 days) gave rise 2-fold increase amount fructose 2,6-bisphosphate phosphofructokinase-2 activity, increased pyruvate kinase activity 4-fold. If, addition, cold-acclimated rats treated T4, parameters significantly enhanced. effect phosphofructokinase-2 Vmax, without modification Km (for fructose 6-phosphate ATP) enzyme. hypothyroid state, however, activity pyruvate kinase remains unchanged. data support previous observations stimulation glycolytic flux cold adaptation brown adipose tissue, permissive role thyroid hormones process.
