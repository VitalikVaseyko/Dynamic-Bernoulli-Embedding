 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) required transfer carbons pyruvate Krebs cycle. PC activity preserved islets obese animals, reduced islets animal models type 2 diabetes, suggesting PC important beta cell adaptation insulin resistance PC reduction may lead beta cell failure. METHODS: confirm significance PC, first lowered activity using Pc (now known Pcx) small interfering RNA (siRNA) INS-1 cells dispersed rat islet cells. Second, overexpressed PC INS-1 cells, third, inhibited PDH overexpressing gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) INS-1 cells. RESULTS: Treatment INS-1 cells dispersed rat islet cells Pc siRNA resulted significant reduction insulin secretion cell types reduced proliferation INS-1 cells. treatment also reduced content oxaloacetate, malate ATP, well NADPH:NADP(+) ratio activity pyruvate-malate shuttle. Overexpression PC INS-1 cells led elevation insulin secretion cell proliferation, whereas inhibition PDH activity overexpressing Pdk4 INS-1 cells reduce insulin secretion. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: findings indicate PC pathway beta cells might play key role pyruvate metabolism, insulin secretion cell proliferation.
