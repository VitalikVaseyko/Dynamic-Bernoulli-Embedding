 cooperative binding allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate [Fru(1,6)P2] yeast pyruvate kinase investigated equilibrium dialysis fluorescence quench titration. results show yeast pyruvate kinase binds four molecules Fru(1,6)P2 per tetramer observed fluorescence quench follows binding ligand cooperative R state transition. Additionally shown binding Fru(1,6)P2 yeast pyruvate kinase compatible model cooperativity proposed incorporates intermediate state, R', properties R states.
