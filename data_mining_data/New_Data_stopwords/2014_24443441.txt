 study, report 8 compound heterozygotes mutations key erythroid transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 1 patients presented severe, transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia. cases, red cells hypochromic microcytic, consistent abnormalities hemoglobin synthesis. addition, many cases, red cells resembled seen patients membrane defects enzymopathies, known chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA). Analysis RNA protein primary erythroid cells individuals provided evidence abnormal globin synthesis, persistent expression fetal hemoglobin and, remarkably, expression large quantities embryonic globins postnatal life. red cell membranes abnormal, notably expressing reduced amounts CD44 and, consequently, manifesting rare In(Lu) blood group. Finally, tested patients showed abnormally low levels red cell enzyme pyruvate kinase, known cause CNSHA. patients define new type severe, transfusion-dependent CNSHA caused mutations trans-acting factor (Kruppel-like factor 1) reveal important pathway regulating embryonic globin gene expression adult humans.
