 Seventeen renal cell carcinomas (RCC) classified histologically investigated expression L- M2-pyruvate kinase (PK) immunohistochemically. Using monoclonal antibodies able demonstrate L-PK within 15 RCC two metastases (in thyroid gland bone) fixation aceton paraffin embedding. normal renal tissue enzyme localized within proximal tubules selectively. enzyme reaction L-PK could demonstrated renal oncocytoma, thyroid carcinoma, carcinomas renal pelvis lung. contrast M2-PK detectable tumors metastases investigated study. results presented paper able show (1) RCC derive proximal renal tubules, renal oncocytoma, (2) detection L-PK may helpful identification metastases RCC even undifferentiated (3) enzyme shift L-PK M2-PK within tumor cells RCC resulting alteration glucose utilization energy supply syntheses substrates essential tumor cells.
