 UNLABELLED: experimental protocols used investigation stem cell-mediated liver regeneration rodents characterized activation hepatic stem cell compartment canals Hering followed transit amplification oval cells subsequent differentiation along hepatic lineages. Although protocols numerous often used interchangeably across species, thorough comparative phenotypic analysis oval cells rats mice using well-established generally acknowledged molecular markers provided. present study, evaluated compared molecular phenotypes oval cells several commonly used protocols stem cell-mediated liver regeneration-namely, treatment 2-acetylaminofluorene partial (70%) hepatectomy (AAF/PHx); choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet; 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydro-collidin (DDC) diet; N-acetyl-paraaminophen (APAP). Reproducibly, oval cells showing reactivity cytokeratins (CKs), muscle pyruvate kinase (MPK), adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter ABCG2/BCRP1 (ABCG2), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), delta-like protein 1/preadipocyte factor 1 (Dlk/Pref-1) induced rat liver treated according AAF/PHx CDE DDC protocol. mouse liver, CDE, DDC, APAP protocols induced CKs ABCG2-positive oval cells. However, AFP Dlk/Pref-1 expression rarely detected oval cells. CONCLUSION: results delineate remarkable phenotypic discrepancies exhibited oval cells stem cell-mediated liver regeneration rats mice underline importance careful extrapolation individual species.
