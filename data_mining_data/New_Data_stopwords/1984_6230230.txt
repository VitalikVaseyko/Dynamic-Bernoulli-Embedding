 Several seemingly unrelated procedures used elicit latent ATPase activity soluble spinach coupling factor 1 correlated release tightly-bound ADP uncoupled enzyme. ADP release enhanced presence medium nucleotides, especially substrate ATP, may may involve release catalytic site itself. Similarly, light/dithiothreitol activation membrane-bound CF1 ATPase reported accompanied energy-dependent ADP dissociation. indication ADP release involved ATPase activation mechanism observation pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate trap ADP released light/dithiothreitol treatment greatly retards decay membrane-bound ATPase activity occurs dark, presumably preventing reassociation ADP. time course CF1 reactivation light, light/dithiothreitol activation followed dark decay, allows distinction made apparently rate-limiting dithiol modification rapid dissociation tightly bound ADP.
