 fibrous sheath cytoskeletal structure located principal piece mammalian sperm flagella. Previous studies showed glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, spermatogenic (GAPDHS), germ cell-specific glycolytic isozyme required sperm motility, tightly bound fibrous sheath. determine glycolytic enzymes also bound cytoskeletal structure, isolated highly purified fibrous sheath preparations mouse epididymal sperm using sequential extraction procedure. isolated fibrous sheaths retain typical ultrastructural features exhibit little contamination axonemal outer dense fiber proteins Western blot analyses. Proteomic analysis using peptide-mass fingerprinting MS/MS peptide fragment ion matching identified GAPDHS two additional glycolytic enzyme subunits, isoform aldolase 1 (ALDOA) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), isolated fibrous sheaths. presence glycolytic enzymes fibrous sheath also examined Western blotting. addition GAPDHS, ALDOA, LDHA, method determined pyruvate kinase also tightly bound fibrous sheath. data support role fibrous sheath scaffold anchoring multiple glycolytic enzymes along length flagellum provide localized source ATP essential sperm motility.
