 glass-like transparency human eye lens achieved tight packing abundant crystallin proteins. However, precise role accessory non-crystallin proteins well understood. carried 2-DE mapping proteins rat lens. showed presence high molecular weight filamentous structural proteins spectrin, filensin, tubulin, vimentin, actin phakinin well several forms potential crystallin oligomers comprised alphaA, betaB1, betaA1 betaA4 chains. proteins present include, heat shock protein 71, WD repeat protein 1, several enzymes including alpha-enolase, pyruvate kinase, transketolase aldose reductase. 2-D-DIGE analysis revealed several expression differences lens proteomes male female rats. Female rat lenses contained lower levels aldose reductase, increased proteolyic fragments structural proteins filensin, vimentin phakinin higher levels potential alphaA, betaB1 betaA1 crystallin oligomers. Taken together findings suggest potential differences oxidative stress regulation male female rat lenses, may implications susceptibility cataract formation. Future studies aimed elucidating pre-cataractic changes non-crystallin proteins described may facilitate identification novel markers involved cataractogenesis.
