 Creatine-kinase (CK) pyruvate-kinase (PK) determined cord blood samples 125 normal newborn infants order 1) investigate correlation CK PK, 2) evaluate possible influence mode delivery (cesarean section versus vaginal delivery) birth weight enzyme activity, 3) establish normal values sexes. present investigation, enzyme activities cord blood significantly higher normal adult, correlation observed enzyme activity mode delivery birthweight. Although apparent significant correlation (r = 0.5) CK PK levels cord blood samples, case find high CK PK values, something would suggest preclinical DMD false-positive result. results led us suggest determination serum PK activity male newborn screening programs. would allow early discrimination false-positives clinical cases already neonatal period. Furthermore, concomitant use PK CK boys walking 18 months could useful test diagnosing preclinical DMD boys.
