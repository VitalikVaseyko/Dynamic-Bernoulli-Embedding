 Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells share basic properties, self-renewal pluripotency, cancer cells, also appear share several metabolic alterations commonly observed human tumors. cancer cells' glycolytic phenotype, first reported Otto Warburg, necessary optimal routing somatic cells pluripotency. However, iPS cells establish Warburg-like metabolic phenotype whether metabolic pathways support bioenergetics iPS cells produced mechanisms selected tumorigenic process remain largely unexplored. recently investigated whether reprogramming-competent metabotype iPS cells involves changes activation/expression status H(+)-ATPase, core component mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation repressed activity protein levels human carcinomas, lipogenic switch, refers marked overexpression hyperactivity acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA) fatty acid synthase (FASN) lipogenic enzymes observed nearly examined cancer types. comparison starting population mouse embryonic fibroblasts iPS cell progeny revealed somatic cell reprogramming involves significant increase expression ATPase inhibitor factor 1 (IF1), accompanied extremely low expression levels catalytic beta-F1-ATPase subunit. pharmacological inhibition ACACA FASN activities markedly decreases reprogramming efficiency, ACACA FASN expression notably upregulated iPS cells. Importantly, iPS cells exhibited significant intracellular accumulation neutral lipid bodies; however, bodies may reflection intense lysosomal/autophagocytic activity rather bona fide lipid droplet formation iPS cells, largely unresponsive pharmacological modulation PPARgamma FASN activities. AMPK agonist metformin, endows somatic cells bioenergetic infrastructure protected reprogramming, found drastically elongate fibroblast mitochondria, fully reverse high IF1/beta-F1-ATPase ratio downregulate ACACA/FASN lipogenic enzymes iPS cells. mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase ACACA/FASN-driven lipogenic switch newly characterized instrumental metabolic events that, coupling Warburg effect anabolic metabolism, enable de-differentiation reprogramming somatic cells iPS cells.
