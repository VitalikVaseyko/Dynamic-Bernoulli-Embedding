 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) common functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized unspecific symptoms. clinical practice crucial distinguish non-inflammatory functional problems inflammatory, malignant infectious diseases GI tract. Differentiation involves use clinical, radiological, endoscopic, histological serological techniques, invasive, expensive, time-consuming and/or hindered inaccuracies arising subjective components. range faecal markers appears potential greatly assist differentiation inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) IBS. Faecal markers neutrophil influx mucosa reliable indicators intestinal inflammation role mainly studied discriminating IBD non-IBD conditions (including IBS) rather organic non-organic diseases. Phagocyte-specific proteins S100 family (S100A12, calprotectin) amongst promising faecal biomarkers inflammation. Faecal leukocyte degranulation markers (lactoferrin, polymorphonuclear elastase myeloperoxidase) also suggested diagnostic tools differentiation IBD IBS. recently, additional proteins, including granins, defensins matrix-metalloproteases, discussed differential diagnostic markers IBD IBS. review, promising faecal markers, potential differentiate IBD IBS advance diagnostic practices, discussed.
