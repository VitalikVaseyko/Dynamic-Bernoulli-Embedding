 energy metabolism tumor cells relies aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) characterized increased glycolytic flux accompanied increased formation cytotoxic metabolite methylglyoxal (MGO). Consequently, rate detoxification reactive glycolytic byproduct needs increased order prevent deleterious effects cells. brought increased expression glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) rate-limiting enzyme MGO-detoxifying glyoxalase system. Here, overexpressed GLO1 HEK 293 cells silenced MCF-7 cells using shRNA. Tumor-related properties wild type transformed cells compared key glycolytic enzyme activities assessed. Furthermore, cells subjected hypoxic conditions analyze impact cell proliferation enzyme activities. results demonstrate knockdown GLO1 cancer cells significantly reduced tumor-associated properties migration proliferation, whereas functional alterations found overexpression GLO1 HEK 293 cells. contrast, hypoxia caused inhibition cell growth cells except overexpressing GLO1. Altogether, conclude GLO1 one hand crucial maintaining tumor characteristics malignant cells, and, hand, supports malignant transformation cells hypoxic environment overexpressed.
