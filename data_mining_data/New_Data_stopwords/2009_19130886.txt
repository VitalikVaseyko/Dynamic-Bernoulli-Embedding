 serine/threonine kinase Akt - also known protein kinase B (PKB) - emerged one frequently activated protein kinases human cancer. fact, most, all, tumors ultimately find way activate important kinase. such, Akt activation constitutes hallmark cancer cells, ubiquity presumably connotes important roles tumor genesis and/or progression. Likewise, hypermetabolic nature cancer cells increased reliance "aerobic glycolysis", originally described Otto Warburg colleagues, considered metabolic hallmarks cancer cells. review, address specific contributions Akt activation signature metabolic features cancer cells, including so-called "Warburg effect".
