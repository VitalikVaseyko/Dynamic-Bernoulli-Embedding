 Comparative studies cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40) Ehrlich ascites tumour, mouse liver skeletal muscle, revealed presence two pyruvate kinase fractions: fraction A, salted ammonium sulphate 21-30% saturation predominant liver (type L); fraction B, salted 51-60% saturation predominant tumour (type M2) skeletal muscle (type M). sigmoidal kinetics revealed liver pyruvate kinase reconstructed mixture liver fractions B characterized separately linear kinetics double-reciprocal plot. L-Cysteine inhibited neoplastic fraction B pyruvate kinase decreasing Vmax increasing Km values relation 2-phosphoenolpyruvate. Stearic acid altered kinetic parameters fractions B pyruvate kinase muscle liver, tumour. suggests tumours contain pyruvate kinase variant, characterized greater affinity 2-phosphoenolpyruvate main substrate different sensitivity low-molecular effectors, comparison types L, M2 pyruvate kinase normal tissues.
