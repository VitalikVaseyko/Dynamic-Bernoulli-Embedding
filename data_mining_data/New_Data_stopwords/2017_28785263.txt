 Cellular metabolism known role bioenergetics. recent years, much light shed reprogrammable cellular metabolism underlying many vital cellular processes, cell activation, proliferation, differentiation. Metabolic reprogramming immune endothelial cells (ECs) studied extensively. cell compartments implicated inflammation pathogenesis many diseases similarities metabolic reprogramming analyzed detail. One notable metabolic reprogramming Warburg-like effect, famously described one hallmarks cancer cells. Immune cells ECs display phenotype characterized metabolic switch favoring glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) aerobic conditions. Though energy-inefficient, aerobic glycolysis confers many benefits respiring cells ranging higher rate adenosine triphosphate production maintaining redox homeostasis. Chemical biological regulators either promote perturb effect. review, nitric oxide, hypoxia-inducible factor, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase discussed common involvement metabolic reprogramming systems. vitro animal studies, various discrepancies exist regarding effects regulators metabolic switch. However, generally accepted glycolysis favors inflammatory reactions OXPHOS favors anti-inflammatory processes. reasons observation currently subject intense studies completely understood. Finally, metabolic reprogramming immune cells ECs limit physiological state health also observed pathological states, atherosclerosis cancer. new insights provide us better understanding similarities metabolic reprogramming across number cell types, could pave way future research possible metabolic-based therapeutics.
