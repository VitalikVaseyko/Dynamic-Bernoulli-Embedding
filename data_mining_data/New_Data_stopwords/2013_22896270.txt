 phenotypic effect mutations depend genetic background, phenomenon known epistasis. Many experimental studies found epistasis pervasive, indicate may follow general pattern dependent fitness effect interacting mutations. studies have, however, typically examined effect interactions small number focal mutations single genetic background. Here, extend approach considering interaction two beneficial mutations isolated population laboratory evolved Escherichia coli changes added divergent natural isolate strains E. coli. find interactions focal mutations different genetic backgrounds common. Moreover, pair-wise interaction focal mutations also depended genetic background, negative backgrounds higher absolute fitness. Together, results indicate presence interactions focal mutations, also caution interactions depend quantitatively wider genetic background.
