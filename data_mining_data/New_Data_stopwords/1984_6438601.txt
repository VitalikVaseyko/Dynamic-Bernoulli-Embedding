 presentation treatment central hypoventilation syndrome boy pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) deficiency reported. Dephosphorylated PDHC assayed disrupted fibroblasts pretreatment dichloroacetate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor. Maximal specific activity activated patient PDHC 10% 30% control values. Patient PDHC activity increased alterations concentrations pyruvate cofactors (thiamine pyrophosphate [TPP], coenzyme [CoA], oxidized form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD+]). Clinically, normalization plasma lactate high-lipid diet prevent slowly progressive neurologic decline. patient manifested intermittent ataxia, episodic profound weakness, moderate psychomotor retardation, ophthalmoplegia, retinal pigment epithelial changes. true central hypoventilation syndrome documented basis rigorous radiologic, electrophysiologic, pulmonary function criteria. Theophylline, progesterone, ritalin neither altered ventilatory response CO2 permitted weaning ventilator. contrast, peripheral chemoreceptor stimulants (intravenous doxapram; oral almitrine) effected acute doubling minute ventilation appropriate decreases PaCO2. However, positive response long-term therapy almitrine could unequivocally shown. concluded measurement disrupted fibroblast PDHC following dichloroacetate activation constitutes accurate assay PDHC deficiency. PDHC deficiency must considered differential diagnosis central hypoventilation syndrome; appears first report association. Finally, therapeutic trial peripheral chemoreceptor agonist warranted management central hypoventilation syndrome.
