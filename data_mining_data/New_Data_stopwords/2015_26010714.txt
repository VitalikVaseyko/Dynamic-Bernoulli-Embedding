 Ionizing radiation exposure combined wound injury increases animal mortalities ionizing radiation exposure alone. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) fluroquinolone family synthetic antibiotic available strategic national stockpile emergency use known inhibit bacterial sepsis. purpose study evaluate efficacy ciprofloxacin countermeasure combined injury mortality determine signaling proteins involved energy machinery. B6D2F1/J female mice randomly assigned receive either 9.75 Gy irradiation Co-60 gamma rays followed skin wounding (combined injury; CI) sham procedure (sham). Either ciprofloxacin (90 mg/kg/day) vehicle (VEH) (water) administered orally mice 2 h wounding thereafter daily 10 days. Determination tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) conducted, immunoblotting signaling proteins involved ATP machinery performed. Combined injury resulted 60% survival 10 days compared 100% survival sham group. Furthermore, combined injury caused significant reductions ATP concentrations ileum, pancreas, brain, spleen, kidney lung (-25% -95%) compared sham group. Ciprofloxacin administration combined injury resulted 100% survival inhibited reductions ileum kidney ATP production. Ileum protein levels heat-shock protein 70 kDa (HSP-70, chaperone protein involved ATP synthesis) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH, enzyme complex crucial conversion pyruvate acetyl CoA entrance TCA cycle) significantly lower CI group (vs. sham group). Using immunoprecipitation immunoblotting, HSP-70-PDH complex found present ileum tissue CI mice treated ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, phosphorylation serine residues PDH resulting inactivating PDH enzymatic activity, occurred combined injury, inhibited ciprofloxacin treatment, thus enabling PDH increase ATP production. Increased ileum levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 protein (PDK1, enzyme responsible PDH phosphorylation) combined injury also prevented ciprofloxacin treatment. Taken together, data suggest ciprofloxacin oral administration combined injury role sustained ileum ATP levels, may acted preservation PDH HSP-70 inhibition PDK1. molecular changes ileum simply one host mechanisms working concert one another ciprofloxacin treatment mitigates body weight loss drastically enhances subsequent survival combined injury. end, findings indicate oral treatment ciprofloxacin valuable therapeutic treatment irradiation combined injury warrants analyses elucidate precise mechanisms involved.
