 Feeding high carbohydrate diet induces transcription 15 genes involved metabolic conversion glucose fat. new transcription factor binding glucose response element pyruvate kinase lipogenesis enzyme genes discovered recently. factor, termed carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), activated response high glucose up-regulates genes. Cyclic AMP high fat diet inhibit ChREBP slow glucose utilization. ChREBP able control transcription lipogenic enzyme genes response nutritional hormonal inputs, may play important role disease states diabetes, obesity, hypertension.
