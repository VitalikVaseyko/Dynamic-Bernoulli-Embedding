 Poor maternal nutrition pregnancy associated increased risk cardiovascular disease later life. determine impact maternal undernutrition periconceptional (PCUN: -45 days 6 days) preimplantation (PIUN: 0-6 days) periods cardiac growth metabolism, quantified mRNA protein abundance key regulators cardiac growth metabolism left ventricle sheep fetus late gestation. cardiac protein abundance AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phospho-acetyl CoA carboxykinase (ACC) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) decreased, whereas ACC increased singletons PCUN PIUN groups. twins, however, cardiac ACC decreased PCUN PIUN groups, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) increased PIUN group. singletons, cardiac abundance insulin receptor beta (IRbeta) decreased PCUN group, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK-1) decreased PCUN PIUN groups. twins, however, cardiac abundance IRbeta phospho-Akt substrate 160kDa (pAS160) increased PIUN group. cardiac abundance insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor (IGF-2R), protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) decreased PCUN PIUN singletons extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) also decreased PIUN singletons. contrast, twins, cardiac abundance IGF-2R PKCalpha increased PCUN PIUN groups, phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (pRPS6) increased PCUN group, ERK eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) also increased PIUN fetuses. conclusion, maternal undernutrition limited around time conception sufficient alter abundance key factors regulating cardiac growth metabolism may increase propensity cardiovascular diseases later life.
