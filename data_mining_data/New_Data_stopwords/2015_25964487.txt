 M1 M2 polarized phenotypes dictate distinctive roles macrophages participate inflammatory disorders. growing interest role cellular metabolism macrophage polarization. However, currently unclear whether different aspects specific metabolic program coordinately regulate cellular process. study, found pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), key regulatory enzyme glucose metabolism, plays important role differential activation macrophages. Knockdown PDK1 diminished M1, whereas enhanced M2 activation macrophages. Mechanistically, PDK1 knockdown led diminished aerobic glycolysis M1 macrophages, likely accounts attenuated inflammatory response cells. Furthermore, found mitochondrial respiration enhanced required early activation M2 macrophages. Suppression glucose oxidation, fatty acids, inhibits process. Consistent inhibitory role early M2 activation, knockdown PDK1 enhanced mitochondrial respiration macrophages. data suggest two arms glucose metabolism synergistically regulate differential activation macrophages. findings also highlight central role PDK1 event via controlling glycolysis glucose oxidation.
