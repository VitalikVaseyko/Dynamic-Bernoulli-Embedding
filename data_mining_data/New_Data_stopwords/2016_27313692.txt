 Lung cancer leading cause cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Increasing evidence found cancer metabolism alternations represent critical hallmark lung cancer. urgent requirement understand dissect molecular mechanisms underlying cancer metabolism lung cancer therapy. remains largely unknown whether deregulation miRNAs contributes cancer metabolism. present study aimed investigate role miR-144 lung cancer. Glucose uptake rate lactate production assays demonstrated miR-144 expression decreased therefore enhances aerobic metabolism lung cancer cells. addition, western blot analysis revealed miR-144 performs function increasing expression glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), leading increase glucose uptake lactate production. Furthermore, cell viability assays demonstrated altered metabolism induced miR-144 results rapid growth cancer cells. conclusion, results identify miR-144 molecular switch involved orchestration Warburg effect lung cancer cells via targeting expression GLUT1.
