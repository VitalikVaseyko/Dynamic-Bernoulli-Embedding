 intracellular distribution adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) studied red cells patient "high-ATP syndrome" using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. patient, red cell ATP increased 2.5-fold, whereas 2,3-DPG decreased fourfold due presence hyperactive pyruvate kinase. oxygenated red cells, abnormal concentrations reflected extent complexes ATP 2,3-DPG take part. diminished amount 2,3-DPG bound hemoglobin almost completely replaced ATP-hemoglobin complexes. Therefore, free hemoglobin slightly increased. deoxygenated cells, relative distribution ATP 2,3-DPG complexes significantly disturbed. main difference shift ratio magnesium ATP (MgATP) ATP-hemoglobin complex; 74% total ATP complexed hemoglobin (45% normal cells), whereas concentration MgATP slightly increased respect normal. shortage 2,3-DPG bound hemoglobin could partially replenished increase hemoglobin (Mg) ATP complexes. Therefore, amount uncomplexed hemoglobin raised 15% normal cells 38% patient's cells. result, oxygen-dissociation curve moderately shifted left. concluded regulatory role 2,3-DPG oxygen transport taken part (Mg) ATP patient. aerobic anaerobic cells, increase magnesium bound ATP, either free bound hemoglobin, exceeds decrease 2,3-DPG Mg complex. spite this, amount intracellular free Mg++ normal slightly lowered. suggests presence compensatory mechanism amount total cellular magnesium could increased.
