 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells, even presence available oxygen, glycolysis enhancement. "aerobic glycolysis" known Warburg effect considered one fundamental hallmarks metabolic alteration malignant transformation. feature many tumors also change ions equilibrium, particular reference K(+) intracellular concentration. Another hallmark cancer reprogrammed chemotaxis pathways favour tumor cell dissemination. RESULTS: doubling population time 5 mM K:D-rib treated Hs 578T (HTB-126 (R) ATCC) cell line reduce 30% respect control. chemotactic invasion assay, relative number motile invasive cells, counted inside FBS-AGAR spot, shows decrease maintenance treatment reaching 25% nine days. Hs 578Bst (HTB-125 (R) ATCC) non-tumor cell line treated nineteen days 5 mM K:D-rib split twice well control. morphological change visible treated respect untreated cells. CONCLUSIONS: demonstrate synergic action potassium bicarbonate D-ribose effect Hs 578T cancer cell line proliferation reducing cell cycle time. 5 mM concentration, K:D-rib able modify tumorigenic potential human breast cancer cell line Hs 578T, interfering vitro capability Hs 578 cell line migrate chemotactic stimuli. Despite this, K:D-rib solution, exhibit appreciable toxicity confirmed proliferation assay accomplished Hs 578Bst cell line.
