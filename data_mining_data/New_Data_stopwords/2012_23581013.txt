 prevailing aerobic glycolysis (so called Warburg effect) cancer cells according current understanding consequence reprogramming cellular metabolism process malignant transformation. Metabolic regulation inseparable component cell proliferation machinery tight link activities oncogenes suppressor genes. purpose metabolic reprogramming cancer (but also normal intensively proliferating cells) incorporate greater fraction glucose metabolites newly synthesised macromolecules. Apart that, aerobic glycolysis confers several selective advantages cancer cells. Epidemiological data indicate type 2 diabetes mellitus associated increased incidence several types cancer cancer mortality influenced certain types anti-diabetic treatment, however future research needed explain whether relationship might causal. Deeper knowledge metabolic properties rapidly proliferating cells exploited improvement anti-cancer, immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory therapies.
