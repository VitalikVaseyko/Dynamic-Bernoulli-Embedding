 Warburg effect dominant phenotype cancer cells. show phenotype depends environment. cancer cells regular culture condition, show Warburg effect; whereas lactic acidosis, show nonglycolytic phenotype, characterized high ratio oxygen consumption rate glycolytic rate, negligible lactate production efficient incorporation glucose carbon(s) cellular mass. two metabolic modes intimately interrelated, Warburg effect generates lactic acidosis promotes transition nonglycolytic mode. dual metabolic nature confers growth advantage cancer cells adapting ever changing microenvironment.
