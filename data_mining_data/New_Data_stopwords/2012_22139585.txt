 Tumor establishment penetration consists series complex processes involving multiple changes gene expression protein modification. Proteome changes tumor tissue investigated intraperitoneal administration high concentration ascorbic acid BALB/C mice implanted CT-26 cancer cells using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry. Eighteen protein spots identified whose expression different control ascorbic acid treatment groups. particular, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 1, nucleophosmin, latexin, actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5, M2-type pyruvate kinase, vimentin, tumor protein translationally-controlled 1, RAS oncogene family Ran, plastin 3 precursor, ATPase, Rho GDT dissociation inhibitor beta, proteasome activator subunit 2 expression quantitatively up-regulated. increase level proteins accompanied increase mRNA level. cytoskeleton protein actin, vimentin, tumor protein translationally-controlled 1 showed quantitative expression profile differences. change actin cytoskeleton distribution, functionally relevant proteome result, observed treatment ascorbic acid. results suggest previously undefined role ascorbic acid regulation cytoskeleton remodeling tumor tissues.
