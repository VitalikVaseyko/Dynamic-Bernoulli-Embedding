 Several decades ago, Otto Warburg discovered cancer cells produce energy predominantly glycolysis; phenomenon termed "Warburg effect". Warburg linked mitochondrial respiratory defects cancer cells aerobic glycolysis; theory gradually lost importance lack conclusive evidence confirming presence mitochondrial defects cancer cells. Scientists began believe altered mechanism energy production cancer cells effect cause. 50 years later, clinical use FDG-PET imaging diagnosis monitoring cancers rekindled interest scientific community Warburg's hypothesis. last ten years considerable progress field advanced understanding Warburg effect. However, still remains unclear Warburg effect plays causal role cancers epiphenomenon tumorigenesis. review aim discuss molecular mechanisms associated Warburg effect emphasis recent advances field including role epigenetic changes, miRNAs post-translational modification proteins. addition, also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies target dependence cancer cells altered energy processing aerobic glycolysis.
