 conformations MgATP bound nucleotidyl transfer enzyme, methionyl tRNA synthetase phosphoryl transfer enzyme, pyruvate kinase, studied transferred NOE (TRNOE) measurements 1H NMR. experiments performed D2O solutions 276 MHz 300 MHz, 10 degrees C presence approximately tenfold excess substrate enzyme (sites). Selective inversion chosen resonances accomplished appropriately tailored DANTE sequence consisting 100 phase-alternating hard 1.8 degree pulses. NOE measurements made terms difference spectra (with without inversion) 6-8 delay times ranging 10-500 ms following DANTE sequence. full complement ten NOE build-up curves obtained enzyme complex analyzed using complete relaxation-matrix method (which includes non-exchangeable protons MgATP) suitably modified include exchange bound free substrate. Molecular mechanics computations used examine energetic implications NOE-determined structure. final structures obtained MgATP bound two enzymes similar other, 3'-endo sugar pucker anti conformation glycosidic torsional angle (O'4-C'1-N9-C8) 39 degrees +/- 4 degrees. enzymes contain multiple binding sites MgATP hence structure obtained case represents average due chemical exchange. However, TRNOE experiments performed tryptic fragment methionyl tRNA synthetase single MgATP binding site, show structure fits measurements well. evidence, coupled striking similarity structures deduced, two enzyme complexes, reciprocal sixth-power dependence NOE interproton distance, strongly suggests conformations individual binding sites enzymes virtually identical. conclusion contrast multiple conformations MgATP bound pyruvate kinase, proposed Rosevear, P.R., Fox, T.L. & Mildvan, A.S.
