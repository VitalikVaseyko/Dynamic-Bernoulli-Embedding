 examine possibility independent cytoplasmic/transmembrane domain-based apical sorting, investigated paramyxovirus SV5 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), type II membrane protein small N-terminal signal/anchor region. SV5-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, >90% HN found apical surface. expressed chimeric proteins N terminus HN, including signal/anchor region, attached (normally cytosolic) reporter pyruvate kinase (PK). PK expressed immediately downstream cleavable signal peptide converted 58-kDa N-linked glycosylated form, secreted predominantly (80%) basolateral surface MDCK cells. contrast, stably expressed PK chimeras, anchored type II membrane proteins either first 48 72 amino acids HN, received similar N-linked glycosylation, yet exhibited polarized transport preferentially (75%) apical distribution. results suggest N-terminal signal/anchor region HN contains independent sorting information apical specific targeting MDCK cells.
