 phosphorylation state six cytoplasmic proteins increased following treatment isolated rat hepatocytes hormones elevate free intracellular Ca2+ levels (Garrison, J. C. Wagner, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13135-13143). Tryptic 32P-phosphopeptide maps two substrates, pyruvate kinase 49,000-dalton protein, major 32P-labeled protein hepatocytes, prepared following stimulation cells vasopressin, Ca2+-linked hormone. Peptide maps 49,000-dalton protein phosphorylated vitro recently identified multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase contained phosphopeptides identical observed intact cell, suggesting kinase activated response Ca2+-mobilizing hormones. Similar vitro phosphorylation experiments pyruvate kinase suggested Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylate serine residues observed following vasopressin stimulation intact cell also additional threonine residues. pyruvate kinase 49,000-dalton protein also phosphorylated hepatocyte response glucagon vitro cAMP-dependent protein kinase. vasopressin glucagon appear stimulate phosphorylation identical serine residues pyruvate kinase vasopressin enhances phosphorylation certain sites 49,000-dalton protein. Comparison tryptic phosphopeptide maps substrates phosphorylated vitro either Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase cAMP-dependent protein kinase suggests Ca2+-dependent kinase phosphorylate unique sites substrates. appears share specificity sites cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Overall, results suggest multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase plays important role response hepatocyte Ca2+ signal.
