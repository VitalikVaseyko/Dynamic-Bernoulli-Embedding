 Estrogen known affect regulation six established anterior pituitary gland (AP) hormones, little known specifics regulation AP hormones, isoforms, nonhormonal AP proteins. used difference gel electrophoresis conjunction matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry peptide mass fingerprinting quantify effects estrogen AP-soluble protein fraction rats. Two-month-old rats ovariectomized used 6 months age. injected subcutaneously sesame oil vehicle 50 mug estradiol valerate vehicle studied 48 hrs later, approximately 3 hrs time anticipated onset estrogen-induced surges gonadotropins blood. APs pooled, soluble protein fraction examined replicate analyses. DeCyder software analysis, identified 26 protein spots 1.5-fold greater average increase experimental group relative controls. Nineteen showed 1.5-fold greater decrease. Estrogen increased levels acidic isoforms growth hormone prolactin proteins involved protein synthesis, folding, secretion (e.g., eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2, ERp57, ERp29, Hsc70-ps1, calreticulin, coatomer delta subunit, secretogranin II) metabolic enzymes (e.g., arginosuccinate synthetase, enolase 1, creatine kinase B, phosphoglycerate mutase, malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, aldolase A). majority downregulated proteins involved RNA DNA interactions (e.g., five heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, DEAD-box proteins 17 48, ssDNA binding protein PUR-alpha, PTB-associated splicing factor, Pigpen protein), isovaleryl coenzyme dehydrogenase, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, stathmin 1, vinculin, radixin, secretogranin III also reduced. results indicate estrogen acts vivo within 48 hrs modulate levels significant number AP proteins.
