 Escherichia coli NZN111 pflB ldhA double mutant loses ability ferment glucose anaerobically due redox imbalance. study, two-stage culture NZN111 carried succinic acid production. found NZN111 aerobically cultured acetate, regained ability ferment glucose succinic acid major product subsequent anaerobic culture. two-stage culture carried flasks, succinic acid produced level 11.26 g/liter 13.4 g/liter glucose succinic acid yield 1.28 mol/mol glucose productivity 1.13 g/liter.h anaerobic stage. Analyses key enzyme activities revealed activities isocitrate lyase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase greatly enhanced pyruvate kinase PEP carboxylase reduced acetate-grown cells. two-stage culture also performed 5-liter fermentor without separating acetate-grown NZN111 cells spent medium. overall yield concentration succinic acid reached 1.13 mol/mol glucose 28.2 g/liter, respectively, productivity succinic acid anaerobic stage dropped 0.7 g/liter.h due cell autolysis reduced anaplerotic activities. results indicate great potential take advantage cellular regulation mechanisms improvement succinic acid production metabolically engineered E. coli strain.
