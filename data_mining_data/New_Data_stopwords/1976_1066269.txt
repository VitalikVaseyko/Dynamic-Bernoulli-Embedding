 Human phosphoglycerate kinase totally purified leukemic granulocytes double 'affinity elution' ATP 3-phosphoglycerate. purification procedure allowed obtain 19 mg protein, specific activity 400 IU/mg i.e. 105-fold purification overall yield 47%. Purified enzyme homogenous tested acrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis immunodiffusion. Specific antibodies raised rabbits totally inactivated phosphoglycerate kinase crude extracts well purified preparation. molecular specific activity (i.e. ratio enzyme activity/immunological reactivity) identical leukocytes, platelets, erythrocytes identical cells value found totally purified phosphoglycerate kinase.
