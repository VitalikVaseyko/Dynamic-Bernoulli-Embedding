 Anticancer agents based haloacetic acids developed inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), enzyme responsible reversing suppression mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. molecular docking studies mono- dihaloacetates identified potent PDK2 binders matched efficiency dichloroacetic acid. silico screening directed conversion phospholipid prodrugs, subsequently self-assembled pro-haloacetate nanoparticles. Following thorough physico-chemical characterization, functional activity novel agents established wide ranges human cancer cell lines vitro vivo rodents. Results indicated newly explored PDK modulators act efficient agent cancer regression. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) assay mechanistically confirmed agents trigger activity mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.
