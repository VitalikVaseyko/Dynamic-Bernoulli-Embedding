 role energy deregulation altered/adapted metabolism tumor cells increasingly important issue understanding cancer. Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) aggressive form RCC characterized germline mutation fumarate hydratase (FH), followed somatic loss remaining wild-type allele known highly metastatic lethal malignancy compared RCCs. intrinsic loss normal tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle presumably aids tumorigenesis due necessary metabolic alterations required enforced dependence glycolysis derived energy, mimicking Warburg effect. Thus, considerable utility establishing preclinical cell model tumors study energy metabolism deregulation, well developing new targeted therapeutic approaches TCA cycle enzyme-deficient cancers. Here, describe new immortalized cell line, UOK268, derived patient's primary HLRCC-associated kidney cancer. represents first primary renal cell line model TCA cycle gene loss provides perfect partner cell line previously described metastasis-derived HLRCC-associated cell line, UOK262. identified novel germline FH missense mutation, p.His192Asp, subsequent loss heterozygosity UOK268. UOK268 cell line expressed mutant FH protein, localized mitochondria, loss almost catalytic activity. UOK268 cells severely compromised oxidative phosphorylation increased glycolytic flux. Ingenuity pathways analysis human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray (hMitChip3) gene chip data confirmed altered mRNA expression patterns genes involved several important pathways, lipid metabolism, apoptosis, energy production/glycolysis. UOK268 provides unique model primary cell line demonstrating enforced, irreversible Warburg effect and, combined UOK262, provides unique vitro preclinical model studying bioenergetics Warburg effect human cancer.
