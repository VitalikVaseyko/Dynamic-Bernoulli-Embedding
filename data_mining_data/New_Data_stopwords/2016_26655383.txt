 hypothesized alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) might interact transcriptional control peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)beta skeletal muscle. Molecular mechanisms investigated using differentiated C2C12 myotubes treated alpha-LA and/or PPARbeta agonist GW0742. vivo studies 3-mo-old C57Bl6 mice realized: voluntary wheel running (VWR) training (7 wk), 6 wk diet containing (or not) alpha-LA (0.25% wt/wt). last condition combined (or not) 1 bout treadmill exercise (18 m/min 1 h). Using reporter assay, demonstrate alpha-LA agonist PPARbeta regulates PPARbeta target gene expression active PPARbeta pathway. GW0742-induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA potentiated alpha-LA. C2C12, alpha-LA lowers activation JNK signaling pathway increases PPARbeta mRNA protein levels (2-fold) extent JNK inhibitor SP600125. Similarly VWR training effect, PPARbeta expression increases (2-fold) vastus lateralis animals fed alpha-LA-enriched diet. However, alpha-LA treatment stimulate adaptive up-regulation PPARbeta observed response 1 bout exercise. identified novel mechanism regulation PPARbeta expression/action skeletal muscle potential physiologic application action alpha-LA, involving JNK pathway.
