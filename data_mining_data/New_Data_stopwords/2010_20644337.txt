 activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) reduced diabetic patients. Phosphorylation PDH E1alpha subunit PDH kinase contributes suppression PDH activity. PDH requires thiamine coenzyme. investigated exact mechanism diabetes-induced PDH inhibition, effect thiamine vivo vitro experiments. Treatment rats thiamine significantly, although partially, recovered streptozotocin (STZ)-induced reductions mitochondrial PDH activity. Nevertheless, found PDH E1alpha phosphorylation thiamine-treated STZ group perfectly diminished level control group. STZ treatment significantly caused enhancements expression O-glycosylated protein rat hearts, decreased thiamine repletion. Next, rat cardiac fibroblasts (RCFs) cultured presence high glucose levels. Thiamine dramatically recovered high glucose-induced PDH inhibition. High glucose loads alter phosphorylated PDH E1alpha. PDH inhibition RCFs accompanied increase PDH E1alpha phosphorylation. O-glycosylated protein markedly increased RCFs exposed high glucose, inhibited thiamine. results suggest thiamine ameliorates diabetes-induced PDH inhibition suppressing increased expression O-glycosylated protein. O-glycosylation PDH E1alpha may involved regulation PDH activity.
