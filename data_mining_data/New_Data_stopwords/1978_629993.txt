 Pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) human liver red cells purified homogeneity; subunit structure kinetic characteristics studied. influence partial proteolysis trypsin subunit structure, isozymic pattern kinetic characteristics red cell liver enzyme investigated. results study may conclude that: 1. Liver (L-type) pyruvate kinase composed 4 identical L subunits major form erythrocyte enzyme (PK-R2) heterotetramer designated L2L2', molecular weight L' slightly higher L subunits (63 000 58 000 respectively). Pyruvate kinase PK-R1, predominant erythroblasts young red cells, composed four identical L' subunits. 2. mild tryptic attack able transform PK-R1 PK-R2, PK-R2 pyruvate kinase L (PK-L). proteolytic treatment transforms L' subunits L ones. 3. Consequently L-type pyruvate kinase seems initially synthesized erythroid precursors L4' enzyme secondarily partially proteolysed L2L2'. liver active proteolytic system would responsible total transformation L4 pyruvate kinase. 4. L4' enzyme exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetic behaviour apparent Michaelis constant 3.8 mM whereas L4 enzyme shows positive negative homotropic interactions towards phosphoenolpyruvate [S] 0.5 1.2 mM. characteristics L2L2' roughly intermediate L4' L4. Fructose 1,6-biphosphate decreases [S]0.5 three pyruvate kinase forms without suppressing differences apparent affinity phosphoenolpyruvate enzymes. 5. L4 pyruvate kinase inhibited Mg-ATP L4', L2L2' intermediate range. 6. Tryptic treatment enzyme form studied transforms kinetic behaviour observed L4.
