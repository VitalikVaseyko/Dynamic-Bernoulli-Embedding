 BACKGROUND: translocation shuttling proteins nucleus cytoplasm (nucleocytoplasmic transport [NCPT]) often rapid event following stimulation growth factors response stress experimental manipulations. Commonly used methods separate nuclei cytoplasm employ lengthy steps density gradient centrifugation exposes cells non-physiological hyperosmotic conditions extended time periods resulting varying degrees leakage nucleus cytoplasm. help maintain quantify nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios proteins, agents leptomycin B employed able better analyze NCPT inhibiting nuclear export. track NCPT absence experimental manipulations could introduce unknown artefacts, developed rapid method appears produce pure nuclear cytoplasmic fractions, suitable obtaining accurate estimates nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios proteins known undergo NCPT. FINDINGS: developed Rapid, Efficient Practical (REAP) method subcellular fractionation primary transformed human cells culture. REAP method two minute non-ionic detergent-based purification technique requiring table top centrifuge, micro-pipette micro-centrifuge tubes. inexpensive method proven efficiently separate nuclear cytoplasmic proteins estimated detectible cross-contamination nucleoporin lamin nuclear markers pyruvate kinase tubulin cytoplasmic markers. REAP fractions also mirrored TNFalpha induced NF-kappaB NCPT observed parallel indirect immunofluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: method drastically reduces time needed subcellular fractionation, eliminates detectable protein degradation maintains protein interactions. simplicity, brevity efficiency procedure allows tracking ephemeral changes subcellular relocalization proteins maintaining protein integrity protein complex interactions.
