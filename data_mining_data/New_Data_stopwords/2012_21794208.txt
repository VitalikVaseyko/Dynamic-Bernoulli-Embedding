 Exome sequencing identified causes several Mendelian diseases, although rarely used clinical setting diagnose genetic cause idiopathic disorder single patient. performed exome sequencing pedigree several members affected attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), effort identify candidate variants predisposing complex disease. identify rare variants might predispose ADHD, yet proven causality them. However, course study, one subject discovered idiopathic hemolytic anemia (IHA), suspected genetic origin. Analysis subject's exome readily identified two rare non-synonymous mutations PKLR gene likely cause IHA, although two mutations documented single individual. confirmed deficiency functional biochemical testing, consistent diagnosis red blood cell pyruvate kinase deficiency. study implies exome genome sequencing certainly reveal additional rare variation causative even well-studied classical Mendelian diseases, also revealing variants might play role complex diseases. Furthermore, study clinical ethical implications exome genome sequencing research setting; handle unrelated findings clinical significance, context originally planned complex disease research, remains largely uncharted area clinicians researchers.
