 1. maximum activity hexokinase lymphocytes similar 6-phosphofructokinase, considerably greater phosphorylase, suggesting glucose rather glycogen major carbohydrate fuel cells. Starvation increased slightly activities glycolytic enzymes. local immunological challenge vivo (a graft-versus-host reaction) increased activities hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, confirming importance glycolytic pathway cell division. 2. activities ketone-body-utilizing enzymes lower hexokinase 6-phosphofructokinase, unlike muscle brain, affected starvation. suggested ketone bodies provide quantitatively important alternative fuel glucose lymphocytes. 3. enzymes tricarboxylic acid cycle whose activities measured, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase lowest, yet activity (about 4.0mumol/min per g dry wt. 37 degrees C) considerably greater flux cycle (0.5mumol/min per g calculated oxygen consumption incubated lymphocytes). activity decreased starvation, citrate synthase increased local immunological challenge vivo. suggested rate cycle would increase towards capacity indicated oxoglutarate dehydrogenase proliferating lymphocytes. 4. Enzymes possibly involved pathway glutamine oxidation measured lymphocytes, suggests aminotransferase reaction(s) (probably aspartate aminotransferase) important conversion glutamate oxoglutarate rather glutamate dehydrogenase, maximum activity glutaminase markedly excess rate glutamine utilization incubated lymphocytes. activity glutaminase increased starvation local immunological challenge vivo. last finding suggests metabolism glutamine via glutaminase important proliferating lymphocytes.
