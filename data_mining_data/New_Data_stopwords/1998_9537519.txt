 cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) analogue, 8-bromo-cGMP (1 mM), increased glucose oxidation isolated soleus muscle. nitric oxide (NO) donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (15 mM), increased glucose, pyruvate, palmitate leucine oxidation. Removal extracellular Ca2+ affect SNP-stimulated glucose oxidation (or glucose utilization parameters), thus eliminating influx Ca2+ mechanism increases. guanylate cyclase inhibitor, LY-83583 (10 microM), inhibited SNP-stimulated palmitate oxidation activation cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Activation PKG might supersede inhibitory effects respiration stimulate metabolic fuel oxidation skeletal muscle.
