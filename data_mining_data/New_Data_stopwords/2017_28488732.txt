 Warburg effect, energy shift mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis, extensively found various cancers. Interestingly, increasing researchers show Warburg effect plays crucial role non-tumor diseases. instance, inhibition Warburg effect alleviate pulmonary vascular remodeling process pulmonary hypertension (PH). Interference Warburg effect improves mitochondrial function cardiac function process cardiac hypertrophy heart failure. Additionally, Warburg effect induces vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation contributes atherosclerosis. Warburg effect may also involve axonal damage neuronal death, related multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, Warburg effect significantly promotes cell proliferation cyst expansion polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Besides, Warburg effect relieves amyloid beta-mediated cell death Alzheimer's disease. Warburg effect also improves mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Finally, also introduce glycolytic agonists. review focuses newest researches role Warburg effect non-tumor diseases, including PH, tuberculosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), failing heart, cardiac hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's diseases, multiple sclerosis, PKD. Obviously, Warburg effect may potential therapeutic target non-tumor diseases.
