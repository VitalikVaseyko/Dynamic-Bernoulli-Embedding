 Daily, intraperitoneal administration either vanadium pentoxide (VP) sodium vanadate (NaV) dose 1 mg/kg 14 days produced marked change pulmonary protein, glycogen phospholipid (PL) levels adult male rats. Increasing VP dose 4 mg/kg decreased lung PL content, equivalent NaV dose elevated tissue glycogen. Treatment either dosage NaV elevated activities pulmonary 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) glutathione peroxidase (GP), higher dose increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) glutathione reductase (GR). 1 mg/kg VP produced significant rise glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 6PGDH. higher VP dose general failed alter enzymic activity. data suggest similar intratracheal instillation, parenteral administration vanadium exerts effect lung metabolism rats.
