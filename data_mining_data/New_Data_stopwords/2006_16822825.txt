 CONTEXT: Protein profiling diabetic tissues could provide useful biomarkers early diagnosis, therapeutic targets, disease response markers. Cultured fibroblasts useful vitro model proteome analysis study molecular mechanisms involved diabetes. OBJECTIVE: objective study isolate characterize proteins cultured fibroblasts, obtained skin biopsy, long-term type 1 diabetic patients without complications age- sex-matched normal subjects controls. DESIGN: Proteins separated two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), gel images qualitatively quantitatively analyzed. Protein identification performed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Reproducible protein maps fibroblasts diabetic healthy subjects obtained. total 125 protein spots isolated identified, among 27 proteins previously reported published human fibroblast 2-DE maps, including 20 proteins never reported previously literature human skin fibroblasts. Quantitative analyses revealed six protein spots differentially expressed fibroblasts diabetic vs. control subjects (P < 0.05), representing glycolytic enzymes structural proteins. increase triosephosphate isomerase two splice isoforms pyruvate kinase alpha-actinin 4 decrease tubulin-beta2 splice isoform 2 tropomyosin beta-chain detected. CONCLUSIONS: generated 2-DE reference maps proteome human skin fibroblasts normal uncomplicated type 1 diabetic patients. Differences glycolytic enzymes structural proteins found. functional implications identified proteins discussed.
