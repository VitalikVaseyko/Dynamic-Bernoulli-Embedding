 Embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) type RNA binding protein 3 (ETR-3; also called NAPOR, CUGBP2, BRUNOL3) implicated regulation nuclear cytoplasmic RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, stability translation. Here, report ETR-3 protein contains multiple regions control subcellular localization important activity splicing regulator. cloned ETR-3 chicken heart fused C terminus green fluorescent protein (GFPcETR3vL). GFPcETR3vL found predominantly nucleus active regulator alternative splicing cotransfection assays cardiac troponin minigene. ETR-3 contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), 210-amino acid divergent domain, C-terminal RRM. demonstrate C terminus contains strong nuclear localization signal overlapping third RRM, confer nuclear localization normally cytoplasmic pyruvate kinase chimera. Additional deletions revealed nuclear localization export activities divergent domain ETR-3, well regions within first two RRMs important cytoplasmic localization. nuclear export activity divergent domain sensitive leptomycin B, indicating export cytoplasm mediated via CRM1-dependent pathway. C terminus region within divergent domain also shown important splicing activity ETR-3. first characterization protein domains involved mediating subcellular localization splicing activity member CELF family RNA processing regulators.
