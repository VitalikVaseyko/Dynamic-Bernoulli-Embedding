 family mild dominant spherocytosis, affected members showed partial band 3 deficiency. index patient showed severe clinical symptoms relatives, red blood cells displayed concomitant low pyruvate kinase activity. investigated contribution partial PK deficiency phenotypic expression mutant band 3 family. Pyruvate kinase deficiency band 3 deficiency characterized DNA analysis. Results red cell osmotic fragility testing, results cell deformability obtained Automated Rheoscope Cell Analyzer results obtained Osmotic Gradient Ektacytometry, combination tests, related red cell ATP content. Spherocytosis family due novel heterozygous mutation SLC4A1, gene band 3. Reduced PK activity index patient attributed novel mutation PKLR inherited mother, without clinical symptoms. Partial PK deficiency associated decreased red cell ATP content markedly increased osmotic fragility. suggests aggravating effect low ATP levels phenotypic expression band 3 deficiency.
