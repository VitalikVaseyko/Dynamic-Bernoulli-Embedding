 kinase-activator protein (KAP) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) purified approx. 2250-fold high-speed supernatants mitochondrial extracts liver 48 h-starved rats. Purified KAP demonstrates kinase activity towards E1 component PDC towards synthetic peptide corresponding major phosphorylation site E1. Furthermore, activities KAP PDC kinase co-fractionate several stages purification apparent mass. conclude KAP distinct protein, kinase dissociated complex.
