 Ingestion carbohydrate exercise may blunt stimulation fat oxidative pathways raising plasma insulin glucose concentrations lowering plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, thereby causing marked shift substrate oxidation. investigated effects single 2-h bout moderate-intensity exercise expression key genes involved fat carbohydrate metabolism without glucose ingestion seven healthy untrained men (22.7 +/- 0.6 yr; body mass index: 23.8 +/- 1.0 kg/m(2); maximal O(2) consumption: 3.85 +/- 0.21 l/min). Plasma FFA concentration increased exercise (P < 0.01) fasted state remained unchanged glucose ingestion, whereas fat oxidation (indirect calorimetry) higher fasted state vs. glucose feeding (P < 0.05). Except significant decrease expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (P < 0.05), glucose ingestion exercise produced minimal effects expression genes involved carbohydrate utilization. However, glucose ingestion resulted decrease expression genes involved fatty acid transport oxidation (CD36, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, uncoupling protein 3, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase-alpha(2); P < 0.05). conclusion, glucose ingestion exercise decreases expression genes involved lipid metabolism rather increasing genes involved carbohydrate metabolism.
