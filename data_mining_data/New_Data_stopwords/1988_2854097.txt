 Two overlapping clones, covering entire coding sequence human M2-type pyruvate kinase (PK) cDNA, isolated sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing results showed contained 109-bp 5'-untranslated region, 1593-bp coding region 585-bp 3'-untranslated region. Nucleotide sequence homology 90% 69% rat M2-type L-type PK cDNA, respectively. situ hybridization using human M2-type PK cDNA probe disclosed gene M2-type PK located band q22 chromosome 15. Northern blot analysis RNA human hepatoma demonstrated M2-type PK predominantly expressed hepatoma cells, whereas L-type PK preferentially expressed non-tumor portion liver.
