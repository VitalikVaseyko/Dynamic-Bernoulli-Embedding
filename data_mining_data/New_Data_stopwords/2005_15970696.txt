 SATB1 nuclear protein, acts cell-type specific genome organizer gene regulator essential cell differentiation activation. Several functional domains SATB1 identified. However, region required nuclear localization remains unknown. delineate region, employed sequence analysis identify phylogenetically diverse members SATB1 protein family, used hidden Markov model (HMM)-based analysis define conserved regions motifs family. One regions conserved SATB1- SATB2-like proteins mammals, fish, frog bird, located near N-terminus family members. found N-terminus human SATB1 essential nuclear localization protein. Furthermore, fusing residues 20-40 cytoplasmic green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused pyruvate kinase (PK) sufficient quantitatively translocate pyruvate kinase nucleus. nuclear targeting sequence human SATB1 (residues 20-40) novel contain clusters basic residues, typically found 'classical' nuclear localization signals (NLSs). investigated importance four well-conserved residues (Lys29, Arg32, Glu34, Asn36) nuclear targeting sequences. Remarkably, full-length SATB1 harboring single point mutation either Lys29 Arg32, Glu34 Asn36, enter nucleus. results indicate SATB1 N-terminal residues 20-40 represent novel determinant nuclear targeting.
