 BACKGROUND: last two decades many efforts directed towards obtaining efficient microbial processes production shikimic acid (SA); however, feeding high amounts substrate increase titer compound invariably rendered low conversion yields, leaving room improvement producing strains. work report alternative platform overproduce SA laboratory-evolved Escherichia coli strain, based plasmid-driven constitutive expression six genes selected pentose phosphate aromatic amino acid pathways, artificially arranged operon. Production strains also carried inactivated genes coding phosphotransferase system components (ptsHIcrr), shikimate kinases II (aroK aroL), pyruvate kinase (pykF) lactose operon repressor (lacI). RESULTS: strong constitutive expression constructed operon permitted SA production beginning cultures, evidenced 1 L batch-mode fermentors starting high concentrations glucose yeast extract. Inactivation pykF gene improved SA production evaluated conditions increasing titer, yield productivity metabolite compared isogenic pykF+ strain. best producing strain accumulated 43 g/L SA 30 h relatively low concentrations acetate aromatic byproducts detected, SA accounting 80% produced aromatic compounds. results consistent high expression levels glycolytic pathway synthetic operon genes beginning fermentations, revealed transcriptomic analysis. Despite consumption 100 g/L glucose, yields glucose SA total aromatic compounds 50% 60% theoretical maximum, respectively. obtained yields specific production consumption rates proved constant three different substrate concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: developed production system allowed continuous SA accumulation glucose exhaustion eliminated requirement culture inducers. obtained SA titers yields represent highest reported values high-substrate batch process, postulating strategy described report interesting alternative traditionally employed fed-batch processes SA production.
