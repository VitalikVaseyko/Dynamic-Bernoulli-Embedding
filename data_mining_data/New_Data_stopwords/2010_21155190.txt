 BACKGROUND: Cancer considered cause type B hyperlactatemia dogs. However, studies evaluating cancer cause clinically relevant type B hyperlactatemia (>2.5 mmol/L) lacking. Cancer cells higher lactate production increased aerobic glycolysis, known "Warburg effect." mechanisms aerobic glycolysis occurs well elucidated, neoplasia may cause type B hyperlactatemia via process. OBJECTIVES: determine malignant tumors dogs associated clinically relevant type B hyperlactatemia (>2.5 mmol/L). ANIMALS: Thirty-seven client-owned dogs malignant tumors: 22 hematopoietic 15 solid tumors. METHODS: Histology used confirm diagnosis (cytology considered adequate diagnosis lymphoma). Confounding conditions associated hyperlactatemia excluded. Lactate measurements immediately performed free-flow jugular whole blood samples using LactatePro analyzer. RESULTS: dogs lactate concentrations<2.5 mmol/L. Mean blood lactate concentration 1.09 mmol/L. Mean blood lactate concentrations solid hematopoietic tumors 0.95 1.19 mmol/L, respectively. Dogs lymphoma (n=18) mean blood lactate concentration 1.15 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant tumors considered cause clinically relevant type B hyperlactatemia. Therefore, cancer-related type B hyperlactatemia dogs uncommon, hyperlactatemia prompt careful investigation causes cancer.
