 Although FK506-binding protein 52 (FKBP52) established positive regulator glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity, vivo role FKBP52 glucocorticoid control metabolism reported. address question, FKBP52(+/-) mice placed high-fat (HF) diet known induce obesity, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance. Tissue profiling wild-type mice showed high levels FKBP52 liver little expression muscle adipose tissue, predicting restricted pattern FKBP52 effects metabolism. response HF, FKBP52(+/-) mice demonstrated susceptibility hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia correlated reduced insulin clearance reduced expression hepatic CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1), mediator clearance. Livers HF-fed mutant mice high lipid content elevated expression lipogenic genes (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c) inflammatory markers (TNFalpha). Interestingly, mutant mice HF showed elevated serum corticosterone, steatotic livers reduced expression gluconeogenic genes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase, glucose 6 phosphatase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4), whereas muscle adipose expressed normal elevated levels glucocorticoid markers. data suggest state glucocorticoid resistance arising liver-specific loss GR activity. Consistent hypothesis, reduced expression gluconeogenic genes CEACAM1 observed dexamethasone-treated FKBP52-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. propose model FKBP52 loss reduces GR control gluconeogenesis, predisposing liver steatosis HF-diet conditions attributable shunting metabolism glucose production lipogenesis.
