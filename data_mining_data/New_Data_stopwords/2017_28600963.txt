 Deficiencies erythrocyte metabolic enzymes associated hereditary hemolytic anemia. Here, report development novel multiplex enzyme assay six major enzymes, namely glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, hexokinase, triosephosphate isomerase, adenosine deaminase, deficiencies implicated erythrocyte enzymopathies. overcome drawbacks traditional spectrophotometric enzyme assays, present assay based ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). products six enzymes directly measured using ion pairing UPLC-MS/MS, precision, linearity, ion suppression, optimal sample amounts, incubation times evaluated. Eighty-three normal individuals 13 patients suspected enzymopathy analyzed. UPLC running time within 5min. ion suppression observed retention time products internal standards. selected optimal dilution factor incubation time enzyme system. intra- inter-assay imprecision values (CVs) 2.5-12.1% 2.9-14.3%, respectively. linearity system good, R(2) values >0.97. Patient samples showed consistently lower enzyme activities normal individuals. present ion paring UPLC-MS/MS assay enables facile reproducible multiplex evaluation activity enzymes implicated enzymopathy-associated hemolytic anemia.
