 OBJECTIVES: Cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) considered potential source biomarkers diseases lower female reproductive tract. fluid easily collected, thereby offering new opportunities development self tests. objective identify CVF protein biomarker cervical cancer precancerous state. METHODS: differential proteomics study set using CVF samples healthy precancerous women. Label-free spectral counting applied quantify protein abundances. RESULTS: proteome analysis revealed 16 candidate biomarkers alpha-actinin-4 (p = 0.001) pyruvate kinase isozyme M1/M2 (p = 0.014) promising. Verification alpha-actinin-4 ELISA (n = 28) showed candidate biomarker discriminated samples healthy low-risk high-risk HPV-infected women (p = 0.009). Additional analysis longitudinal samples (n = 29) showed alpha-actinin-4 levels correlated virus persistence clearing, discrimination approximately 18 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: results show CVF excellent source protein biomarkers detection lower female genital tract pathologies alpha-actinin-4 derived CVF promising candidate biomarker precancerous state cervical cancer. studies regarding sensitivity specificity biomarker demonstrate utility improving current screening programs and/or use cervical cancer self-diagnosis test.
