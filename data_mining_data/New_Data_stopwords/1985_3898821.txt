 incidence deficiency enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) Chinese infants determined. standard assay erythrocyte pyruvate kinase enzyme activity fluorescent screening test (standardized) used. results two tests compared. 1,159 infant cord blood samples studied, 26 (or 2.2%) abnormally low levels PK activity using screening test, 24 samples tested enzyme assay. results indicate frequency defective PK gene population Guangzhou significantly lower (p less .05) previously reported defective gene frequency 3.4% Hong Kong. also demonstrate critical importance standardization screening test, accurate estimates gene frequency derived using test.
