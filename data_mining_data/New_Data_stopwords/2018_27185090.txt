 humans, meat ensures supply proteins high nutritional value indispensable amino acids. main goal present study compare degradation meat proteins adult elderly digestive conditions. Cooked meat subjected vitro digestion dynamic multi-compartmental TIM (TNO gastroIntestinal Model) system. Digestibility bioaccessibility determined using nitrogen balance digestion products identified using mass spectrometry. TIM model adapted according vivo data mimic specific digestive conditions elderly people. Meat protein digestibility bioaccessibility around 96 60% respectively influenced age (P > 0.05). much 800 peptides identified duodenal jejunal compartments issued 50 meat proteins percentage coverage varying 13 69%. Six proteins, mainly cytosol, differentially hydrolyzed adult elderly digestive conditions. Pyruvate kinase protein clearly showing delay degradation elderly digestive conditions. study provides significant insights understanding meat protein dynamic digestion. data helpful design vivo studies aiming evaluate dietary strategies attenuate muscle mass loss generally maintain better quality life elderly population.
