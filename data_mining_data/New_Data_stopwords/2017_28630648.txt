 Microalgae promising feedstock biofuel production. Microalgal metabolic pathways heavily influenced environmental factors. instance, lipid metabolism induced nitrogen-limiting conditions. However, underlying mechanisms lipid biosynthesis unclear. study, analyzed global metabolic profiles three genetically closely related Chlorella strains (C1, C2, C3) significant differences lipid productivity identify contributions key metabolic pathways lipid metabolism. found nitrogen obtained amino acid catabolism assimilated via glutamate-glutamine pathway stored amino acids intermediate molecules (particularly proline, alanine, arginine, succinate, gamma-aminobutyrate) via corresponding metabolic pathways, led carbon-nitrogen disequilibrium. Excess carbon obtained photosynthesis glycolysis re-distributed carbon-containing compounds, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, lactate, citrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, leucine, diverted lipid metabolism production storage lipids via gamma-aminobutyrate pathway, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle. results substantiated model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii analyzing various mutants deficient glutamate synthase/NADH-dependent, glutamate synthase/Fd-dependent, glutamine synthetase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase. study suggests carbon also nitrogen assimilation distribution pathways contribute lipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, findings may facilitate genetic engineering efforts enhance microalgal biofuel production.
