 SNAIL promising target treatment cancer known promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Recent studies suggest SNAIL also takes part metabolic reprogramming chemotherapy resistance cancers. prostate cancer (PCa), SNAIL proved required hypoxia-induced invasion potential marker predicting recurrence. However, role SNAIL PCa aberrant metabolism poorly understood. study, identified SNAIL regulated cellular growth energy metabolism miR-128-mediated ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (RPS6KB1)/HIF-1alpha/PKM2 signaling pathway played key role reprogramming cancer metabolism. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), found SNAIL expression elevated castration-resistant prostate cancer tissues compared androgen-dependent prostate cancer tissues nontumorous tissues. Depletion SNAIL increased miR-128 expression levels, inhibited cell growth, reduced glucose consumption lactate production, repressed expression RPS6KB1, HIF-1alpha, PKM2 PCa cells. Luciferase reporter assays showed SNAIL regulated miR-128 expression transcriptional level miR-128 modulated RPS6KB1 expression translational level. Furthermore, down-expression miR-128 partially restored effect si-SNAIL suppression cellular growth, metabolism, RPS6KB1/HIF-1alpha/PKM2 signaling pathway. knowledge, first time demonstrate SNAIL/miR-128/RPS6KB1 pathway plays critical role progression PCa.
