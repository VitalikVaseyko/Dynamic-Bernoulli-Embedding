 triazine dye, Reactive Red 120, found bind tightly (Kd = 30) nM) low stoichiometry sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. finding high-affinity binding caused noncompetitive inhibition Ca2+-ATPase indicates dye-binding site distinct active site putative regulatory site. Detergent solubilization (monomerization) Ca2+-ATPase caused 25-fold decrease affinity Reactive Red 120, causing decrease affinity toward another dye, Reactive Blue 2. Reactive-Red-120-inhibited enzyme, level steady-state enzyme phosphorylation ATP significantly different exhibited control Ca2+-ATPase. rate dephosphorylation presence absence ADP, however, markedly decreased presence inhibitor. Distance measurements fluorescence energy transfer active (FITC-reactive) site Reactive Red 120 site gave value 59 A. Similar experiments yielded average distance 35 latter site tryptophan residues, postulated 'sequence model' (MacLennan et al. (1985) Nature 316, 696-700) located transmembrane domain.
