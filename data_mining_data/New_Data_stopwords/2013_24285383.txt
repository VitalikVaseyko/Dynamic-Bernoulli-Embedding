 significant characteristic cancer cell metabolism high level aerobic glycolysis high glucose consumption lactate production. Phophoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) enzyme catalyzes interconversion 3-phosphoglycerate 2-phosphoglycerate glycolysis. reported enzyme commonly upregulated many human cancers. PGAM1 plays important role coordinating glycolysis anabolic activity promote cancer cell proliferation. However, mechanisms effects still poorly understood. review focuses recent advances structure functions PGAM1, PGAM1's role glycolysis cancer cells regulators modulate PGAM1's effects. Progress understanding PGAM1 provide rationale support development new hypothesis-driven studies define PGAM1's potential therapeutic implications cancer treatment.
