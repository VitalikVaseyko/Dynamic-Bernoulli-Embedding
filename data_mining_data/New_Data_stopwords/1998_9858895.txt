 Extracellular AMP inhibits cell proliferation MCF-7 MDA-MB-453 whereas cell proliferation highly malignant Novikoff cell line affected. medium low glucose supply MDA-MB-453 cells grow well, Novikoff cells slightly inhibited MCF-7 cells totally unable grow. Isoelectric focusing revealed glyclytic enzyme complex exists three cell lines. addition glycolytic enzymes, c-Raf-kinase, adenylate kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase also found within complex. differences glucose dependence three cell lines explained different constitutions shuttle enzymes. MDA-MB-453 Novikoff cells contain cytsolic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase associated glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase within glycolytic enzyme complex responsible transport cytoslic hydrogen mitochondria. MCF-7 Novikoff cells contain pI 7.8 form malate dehydrogenase couples glycolysis glutaminolysis.
