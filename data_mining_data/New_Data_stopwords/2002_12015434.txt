 Transcription metabolic genes transiently induced recovery exercise skeletal muscle humans. determine whether pre-exercise muscle glycogen content influences magnitude and/or duration adaptive response, six male subjects performed one-legged cycling exercise lower muscle glycogen content one leg then, following day, completed 2.5 h low intensity two-legged cycling exercise. Nuclei mRNA isolated biopsies obtained vastus lateralis muscle control reduced glycogen (pre-exercise glycogen = 609 +/- 47 337 +/- 33 mmol kg(-1) dry weight, respectively) legs 0, 2 5 h recovery. Exercise induced significant (P < 0.05) increase (2- 3-fold) transcription pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) genes reduced glycogen leg only. Although PDK4, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hexokinase II (HKII) mRNA elevated reduced glycogen leg exercise, consistent difference found two legs response exercise. second study, six subjects completed two trials (separated 2 weeks) consisting 3 h two-legged knee extensor exercise either control (398 +/- 52 mmol kg(-1) dry weight) low (240 +/- 38 mmol kg(-1) dry weight) pre-exercise muscle glycogen. Exercise induced significantly greater increase PDK4 transcription low glycogen (> 6-fold) control (< 3-fold) trial. Induction PDK4 UCP3 mRNA response exercise also significantly higher low glycogen (11.4- 3.5-fold, respectively) control (5.0- 1.7-fold, respectively) trial. data indicate low muscle glycogen content enhances transcriptional activation metabolic genes response exercise, raising possibility signalling mechanisms sensitive glycogen content and/or FFA availability may linked transcriptional control exercise-responsive genes.
