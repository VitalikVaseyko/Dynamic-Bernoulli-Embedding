 report crystal structures phosporylated pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1p) component human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). complete phosphorylation Ser264-alpha (site 1) variant E1p protein achieved using robust pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 free PDC core. show unlike unmodified counterpart, presence phosphoryl group Ser264-alpha prevents cofactor thiamine diphosphate-induced ordering two loops carrying three phosphorylation sites. disordering phosphorylation loops caused previously unrecognized steric clash phosphoryl group site 1 nearby Ser266-alpha, nullifies hydrogen-bonding network essential maintaining loop conformations. disordered phosphorylation loops impede binding lipoyl domains PDC core E1p, negating reductive acetylation step. results disruption substrate channeling PDC, leading inactivation catalytic machine.
