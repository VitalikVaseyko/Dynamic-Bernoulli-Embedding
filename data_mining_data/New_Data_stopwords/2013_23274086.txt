 AMPK metabolic sensor helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis. Despite evidence linking AMPK tumor suppressor functions, role AMPK tumorigenesis tumor metabolism unknown. show AMPK negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) cancer cells suppresses tumor growth vivo. Genetic ablation alpha1 catalytic subunit AMPK accelerates Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. Inactivation AMPKalpha transformed nontransformed cells promotes metabolic shift aerobic glycolysis, increased allocation glucose carbon lipids, biomass accumulation. metabolic effects require normoxic stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), silencing HIF-1alpha reverses shift aerobic glycolysis biosynthetic proliferative advantages conferred reduced AMPKalpha signaling. Together findings suggest AMPK activity opposes tumor development loss fosters tumor progression part regulating cellular metabolic pathways support cell growth proliferation.
