 Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn causes sheath blight disease rice, genetic resistance desirable characteristic. Current improvement efforts based analysis polygenic quantitative trait loci (QTLs), interpretation limited lack information changes metabolic pathways. previous studies linked activation glycolytic pathway enhanced generation lignin phenylpropanoid pathway. current studies investigated regulation glycolysis examining time course changes enzymatic activities metabolite contents. results showed activities glycolytic enzymes well fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P(2)), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate contents increased. results combined previous findings expression phosphoglucomutase (PGM), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), enolase pyruvate kinase (PK) increased infection suggested additional establishment glycolysis cytosol compartment occurred infection. evidence recent findings increase expression 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) plastid isozyme Os06g05860 accompanied increase expression three cytosolic PFK isozymes, i.e. Os01g09570, Os01g53680 Os04g39420, well pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofrucokinase (PFP) isozymes Os08g25720 (alpha-subunit) Os06g13810 (beta-subunit) infected rice plants resistant line. results also showed reactions catalysed PFK/PFP, aldolase, GAPDH + phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) PK leaf sheaths R. solani-infected rice plants non-equilibrium reactions vivo. study showed PGM, phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), TPI phosphoglycerate mutase (PGmu) + enolase could regulated coarse control whereas, PFK/PFP, aldolase, GAPDH + PGK PK could regulated coarse fine controls simultaneously.
