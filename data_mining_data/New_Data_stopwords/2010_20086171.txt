 MYC oncogene, frequently deregulated human cancers, encodes master transcription factor c-Myc (herein termed Myc) integrates cell proliferation metabolism regulation thousands genes including microRNAs (miRNA). addition known function regulating cell cycle glucose metabolism, recent studies document role Myc stimulating glutamine catabolism, part repression miRNAs miR-23a miR-23b. observations suggest additional level complexity tumor metabolism, includes commensal metabolic relationship hypoxic nonhypoxic regions tumors well surrounding stroma. Thus, reevaluation cancer metabolism considering glutamine catabolism better understanding tumor histological complexity needed cancer metabolism effectively targeted therapy.
