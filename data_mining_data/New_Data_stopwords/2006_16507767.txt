 Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) key enzyme trans-sulfuration pathway, uses L-cysteine produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S). CSE/H2S system shown play important role regulating cellular functions different systems. present study, overexpressed CSE human aorta smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) using recombinant defective adenovirus containing CSE gene (Ad-CSE). Infection HASMCs Ad-CSE resulted significant increase expression CSE protein H2S production. Ad-CSE transfection inhibited cell growth stimulated apoptosis, evidenced cell viability assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, TUNEL, caspase 3 activation. CSE-mediated apoptosis associated increased ERK p38 MAPK activation, up-regulation p21(Cip/WAK-1), down-regulation cyclin D1 expression. inhibiting endogenous background CSE gene expression, direct administration H2S 100 microM induced apoptosis HASMCs. two endproducts CSE-catalyzed enzymatic reaction, ammonium pyruvate, failed so. results demonstrate overexpression CSE stimulates SMC apoptosis due increased endogenous production H2S. Adenovirus-mediated transfer CSE gene may provide novel therapeutic approach treating vascular diseases linked abnormal cellular proliferation vascular remodeling.
