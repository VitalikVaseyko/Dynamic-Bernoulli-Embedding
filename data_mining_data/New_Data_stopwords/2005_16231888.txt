 Surface-grafted, environmentally responsive polymers shown great promise controlling adsorption desorption macromolecules cells solid surfaces. paper, demonstrate certain mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) methyl-terminated alkanethiolates gold form surfaces switchable hydrophobicity tendency protein adsorption cellular attachment. temperatures 32 degrees C, SAMs surface density approximately 50% OEG adsorbed significant amounts pyruvate kinase lysozyme, whereas temperature, SAMs resistant adsorption proteins. Furthermore, protein layers adsorbed SAMs 32 degrees C removed upon rinsing water temperature. Similar results seen attachment release marine bacterium, Cobetia marina. change nonresistance adsorptive state SAMs concomitant change advancing water contact angle. Vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy suggests temperature-induced changes coincide disorder-to-partial order transition hydrated methylene chains OEG moieties within SAMs. Mixed OEG-methyl SAMs represent convenient means controlling macromolecular cellular adsorption within laboratory useful tool relating adsorption properties molecular structures within SAMs.
