 transcription factors LF-A1 LF-B1 required cell-specific expression human alpha 1-antitrypsin gene hepatocytes. report purification preliminary characterization LF-A1. protein, purified homogeneity calf liver nuclei site-specific DNA affinity chromatography reverse-phase HPLC, molecular mass 40 kDa. Binding sites LF-A1 present promoter regions several genes expressed liver (alpha 1-antitrypsin, apolipoproteins A1, B1, A4 pyruvate kinase). Interestingly, binding site LF-A1 bipartite consists two short sequence motifs (consensus: TGGACT/CT/C TGGCCC) separated variable 'spacer' region. Insertion deletion 1-4 nucleotides 'spacer' region site alpha 1-antitrypsin promoter abolish DNA binding.
