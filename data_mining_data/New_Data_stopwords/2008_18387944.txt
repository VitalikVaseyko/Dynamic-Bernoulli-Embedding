 PDHK2 mitochondrial protein kinase phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thereby down-regulating oxidation pyruvate. Here, present crystal structure PDHK2 bound inner lipoyl-bearing domain dihydrolipoamide transacetylase (L2) determined without bound adenylyl imidodiphosphate. structures reveal PDHK2 dimer complexed two L2 domains. Comparison apo-PDHK2 shows L2 binding causes rearrangements PDHK2 structure affect L2- E1-binding sites. Significant differences found PDHK2 PDHK3 respect structure lipoyllysine-binding cavities, providing first structural support number studies showing isozymes markedly different respect affinity L2 domain. structures display novel type II potassium-binding site located PDHK2 interface L2 domain. Binding potassium ion site rigidifies interface appears critical determining strength L2 binding. Evidence also presented potassium ions indispensable cross-talk nucleotide- L2-binding sites PDHK2. latter believed essential movement PDHK2 along surface transacetylase scaffold.
