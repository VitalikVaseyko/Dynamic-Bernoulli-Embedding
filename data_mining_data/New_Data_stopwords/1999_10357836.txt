 N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) suppress hepatic adipocyte de novo lipogenesis inhibiting transcription genes encoding key lipogenic proteins. cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, arachidonic acid (20:4,n-6) suppression lipogenic gene expression requires cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. study, found evidence support role COX-1 -2 20:4,n-6 inhibition hepatocyte lipogenic gene expression. contrast L1 preadipocytes, adipocytes rat liver, RT-PCR Western analyses detect COX-1 COX-2 expression cultured primary hepatocytes. Moreover, COX inhibitor, flurbiprofen, affect 20:4,n-6 regulation lipogenic gene expression primary hepatocytes. Despite absence COX-1 -2 expression primary hepatocytes, prostaglandins (PGE2 PGF2alpha) suppressed fatty acid synthase, l-pyruvate kinase, S14 protein mRNA, effect acyl-CoA oxidase CYP4A2 mRNA. Using PGE2 receptor agonist, PGE2 effect lipogenic gene expression linked EP3 receptors. PGE2 inhibited S14CAT activity transfected primary hepatocytes targeted S14 PUFA-response region located -220 -80 bp upstream transcription start site. Taken together, studies show COX-1 COX-2 contribute n-6 PUFA suppression hepatocyte lipogenic gene expression. However, cyclooxygenase products non-parenchymal cells act parenchymal cells paracrine process mimic effects n-6 PUFA lipogenic gene expression.
