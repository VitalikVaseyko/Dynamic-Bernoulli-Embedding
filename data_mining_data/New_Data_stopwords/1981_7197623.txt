 Twenty-eight male subjects underwent maximal exercise test ergometric bicycle, 13 untrained 15 trained subjects. rest maximal exercise, indicated increase serum lactate pyruvate acids, venous blood samples taken study release muscular enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, LDH, alpha HBDH, CPK, CPK MB) myoglobin next 24 h (3 min, 30 min, 8 h 24 h end test). statistic analysis results shows significant increases comparison values rest, according enzymes groups subjects, especially CPK, SGOT, SGPT results homogeneous peak 3rd min 8th h three groups HBD LDH groups trained subjects. However values remain often within normal limits. results compared previous works subjects.
