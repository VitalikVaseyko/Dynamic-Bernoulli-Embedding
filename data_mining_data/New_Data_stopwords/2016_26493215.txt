 BACKGROUND: Lafora disease (LD, OMIM 254780) fatal neurodegenerative disorder produced mainly mutations two genes: EPM2A, encoding dual specificity phosphatase laforin, EPM2B, encoding E3-ubiquitin ligase malin. Although known laforin malin may form functional complex, underlying molecular mechanisms pathology still far understood. METHODS: order gain information substrates laforin/malin complex, carried yeast substrate-trapping screening, originally designed identify substrates protein tyrosine phosphatases. RESULTS: results identify two muscular isoforms pyruvate kinase (PKM1 PKM2) novel interaction partners laforin. CONCLUSIONS: present evidence indicating laforin/malin complex able interact ubiquitinate PKM1 PKM2. post-translational modification, although affect catalytic activity PKM1, impairs nuclear localization PKM2.
