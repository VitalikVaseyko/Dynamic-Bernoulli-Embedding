 BACKGROUND & AIMS: hypothesized far poorly understood improvement postoperative insulin sensitivity, surgery preceded carbohydrate (CHO) drink, occurs via attenuation skeletal muscle inflammatory responses surgery, improved insulin signaling attenuated expression muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4. METHODS: Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies, collected major abdominal surgery postoperative hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamping 16 pigs randomized either 200 ml CHO-supplemented drink 2 h surgery (CHO, 25 g; n = 8), preoperative overnight fasting (fasted; n = 8), analyzed fast qRT-PCR IR-Western blotting. RESULTS: clamping, expression IKKbeta, SOCS3 ratio phosphorylated/total JNK2 proteins lower CHO group fasted group (-1.0 vs. 2.9-fold, P < 0.001; -0.6 vs. 3.2-fold, P < 0.01; -0.5 vs. 1.1-fold, P < 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, ratio Ser(307)-phosphorylated (inhibition)/total IRS1 protein reduced CHO group (-2.4 fold, P < 0.02), whereas FOXO1 phosphorylation (inactivation), correlated negatively PDK4 mRNA (r(2) = 0.275, P < 0.05), lower CHO group fasted group (-1.1-fold, P > 0.05 vs. -2.3-fold, P = 0.05). Post-surgery, PDK4 mRNA increased approximately 20-fold (P < 0.01) groups, reversed greater extent insulin CHO group (-40.5 vs. -22.7-fold, P < 0.05), resulting 5-fold lower PDK4 protein levels, correlated negatively insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal rates (r(2) = -0.265, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative carbohydrate supplementation found ameliorate postoperative insulin sensitivity reducing muscle inflammatory responses improved insulin inhibition FOXO1-mediated PDK4 mRNA protein expression surgery.
