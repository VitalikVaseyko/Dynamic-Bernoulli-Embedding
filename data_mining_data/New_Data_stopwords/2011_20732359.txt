 Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) mediates adaptive responses reduced oxygen availability regulating gene expression. critical cell-autonomous adaptive response chronic hypoxia controlled HIF-1 reduced mitochondrial mass and/or metabolism. Exposure HIF-1-deficient fibroblasts chronic hypoxia results cell death due excessive levels reactive oxygen species (ROS). HIF-1 reduces ROS production hypoxic conditions multiple mechanisms including: subunit switch cytochrome c oxidase COX4-1 COX4-2 regulatory subunit increases efficiency complex IV; induction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, shunts pyruvate away mitochondria; induction BNIP3, triggers mitochondrial selective autophagy; induction microRNA-210, blocks assembly Fe/S clusters required oxidative phosphorylation. HIF-1 also required ischemic preconditioning effect may due part induction CD73, enzyme produces adenosine. HIF-1-dependent regulation mitochondrial metabolism may also contribute protective effects ischemic preconditioning. article part Special Issue entitled: Mitochondria Cardioprotection.
