 Glioma stem cells highly resistant cell death supposed contribute tumor recurrence eluding anticancer treatments. Here, show spheroids contain rat neural stem cells (NSCs) rat glioma stem cells (cancer stem cells, CSCs) express isoforms 1 2 pyruvate kinase (PKM1 PKM2); however, expression PKM2 considerably higher glioma spheroids. Silencing PKM2 enhances apoptosis differentiation rat human glioma spheroids. establish PKM2 implicated glioma spheroid differentiation interaction Oct4, major regulator self-renewal differentiation stem cells. small molecule Dichloroacetate (DCA), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, increases amount PKM2/Oct4 complexes thus inhibited Oct4-dependent gene expression. Taken together, results highlight new molecular pathway PKM2 manage gliomagenesis via control glioma stemness Oct4.
