 Toxoplasma gondii protozoan parasite infecting almost warm-blooded animals humans. three infective stages T. gondii: tachyzoites, bradyzoites, oocysts. tachyzoite rapidly multiplying stage main pathogenic factor. North America Europe, T. gondii consisted four major clonal lineages (namely Types I, II, III, Type 12). study, explored proteomic profiles different genotypes (Type I-RH strain, Type II-PRU strain, Type II-TgQHO strain, ToxoDB 9-TgC7 strain) T. gondii tachyzoites using 2D DIGE combined MALDI-TOF MS. Totally, 110 differentially abundant protein spots selected. these, 98 spots corresponding 56 proteins T. gondii successfully identified. included surface antigen (SAG1), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70), disulfide isomerase, coronin, heat shock protein 60 (Hsp 60), pyruvate kinase, receptor activated C kinase 1, peroxiredoxin. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed differentially abundant proteins involved biological regulation, metabolic process, response stress, binding, antioxidant activity, transporter activity. According KEGG metabolic pathway maps T. gondii, identified proteins involved glycolytic/gluconeogenesis pathway. present study identified differentially abundant proteins among different genotypes T. gondii findings implications better understanding phenotypic differences among examined T. gondii genotypes, turn may contribute better control toxoplasmosis.
