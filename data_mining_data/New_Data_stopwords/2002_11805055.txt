 Portions cloned mating-type (MT) loci (mt(+) mt(-)) Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, defined approximately 1-Mb domains linkage group VI recombinational suppression, subjected Northern analysis elucidate coding capacity. four central rearranged segments loci found contain housekeeping genes (expressed several life-cycle stages) mating-related genes, sequences unique mt(+) mt(-) carried genes expressed gametic zygotic phases life cycle. One genes, Mtd1, candidate participant gametic cell fusion; two others, Mta1 Ezy2, candidate participants uniparental inheritance chloroplast DNA. identified housekeeping genes include Pdk, encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, GdcH, encoding glycine decarboxylase complex subunit H. Unusual genetic configurations include three genes whose sequences overlap, one gene inserted coding region another, several genes inactivated rearrangements region, genes undergone tandem duplication. report extends original conclusion MT locus incurred high levels mutational change.
