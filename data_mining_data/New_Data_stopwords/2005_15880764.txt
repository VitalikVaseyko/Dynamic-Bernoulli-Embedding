 concentrations D- L-lactate, methylglyoxal pyruvate measured tissues normal starved Octopus ocellatus. D-Lactate always abundant L-lactate tissues. D-Lactate, pyruvate methylglyoxal present 320, 94 43 times higher concentrations tentacle O. ocellatus control group normal rat skeletal muscle. D-lactate concentration tentacle O. ocellatus 17-fold higher Octopus vulgars. activities enzymes involved D-lactate metabolism pyruvate kinase, octopine dehydrogenase, glyoxalase II lactate dehydrogenase measured tissues. activities glyoxalase II, D-lactate dehydrogenase increased mantle tentacle starved octopus, levels D-lactate related metabolites lowered tissues. experimental results presented report present indicate D-lactate actively used energy production tentacle mantle starved animals. octopus, especially starved octopus D-lactate actively produced methylglyoxal, formed via aminoacetone threonine glycine.
