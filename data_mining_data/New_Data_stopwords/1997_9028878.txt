 Cleavage tubulin tryptophan residues yielded several peptides, one strongly interacted aldolase determined inhibition aldolase activity. peptide identified C-terminal, residues 408-451, alpha-subunit tubulin. Peptides identical sequences C-terminal regions alpha- beta-subunits tubulin synthesized characterize interactions glycolytic enzymes. 43-amino-acid C-terminal peptide alpha-tubulin (residues 409-451) found binding properties similar native tubulin designated tubulin glycolytic enzyme binding domain (T-GEBD-43mer).
