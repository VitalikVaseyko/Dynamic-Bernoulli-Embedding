 rate microbiological ring-expansion penicillin N deacetoxycephalosporin C using protoplast lysates antibiotic-negative mutant Cephalosporium acremonium M-0198 increased 70-fold earlier system. confirmed stimulatory effects FeSO4 ascorbate described Hook et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 87: 258, 1979); optimum concentrations found 0.04 mM FeSO4 0.67 mM ascorbate. Adenosine triphosphate concentration lowered 0.83 mM; phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase eliminated. optimum pH temperature reaction 7.2 25 degrees C, respectively. Alpha-ketoglutarate MnCl2 showed marked effect reactions, MgSO4 KCl mildly stimulatory, CuSO4 ZnSO4 inhibitory. Penicillin N optimal concentration 0.07 mM. Specific ring-expansion activity reached peak 13 hours growth ceased disappeared rapidly.
