 Specific activities 14 enzymes Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pentose phosphate pathways determined extracts resting spores vegetative mycelia Entomophthora pyriformis. enzymes detected mycelial extracts, whereas nine detectable resting spore extracts. Activities detectable spore enzymes much lower corresponding mycelial enzymes exception triosephosphate dehydrogenase, higher activity spore extracts. enzyme deficiencies noted point inability either pathway function dormant spores.
