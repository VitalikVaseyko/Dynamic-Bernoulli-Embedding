 authors investigated vitro functional differentiation fetal mouse liver cultured Rose's circumfusion system use two biochemical markers: analysis inductive response key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism insulin, analysis liver-specific isozyme pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40]. glucokinase [EC 2.7.1.2] activity, found mammalian adult liver, emerged cultivation 2-3 days reached maximum level equivalent one-half adult level. Two- 3-fold increases glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.49] induced single dose insulin fetal liver 12 days cultivaton. Hexokinase [EC 2.7.1.1] activity barely influenced insulin. results suggested fetal mouse liver cultured system 2 weeks maintained response insulin vivo adult mouse liver. pyruvate kinase isozyme patterns mouse livers various developmental stages cultured fetal mouse liver present system investigated isoelectric fractionation. pyruvate kinase isozymes highest relative activity pI-5.5 isozyme adult liver pI-6.5 isozyme 13- 14-day-old fetal liver. development vivo proceeded, gradual change isozyme pattern occurred; consisted progressive decrease pI-6.5 pyruvate kinase isozyme, "fetal type," favor pI-5.5 isozyme, "adult type." pyruvate kinase isozyme pattern 13- 14-day fetal liver cultured system 2 weeks similar found adult liver. Thus, shown "fetal type" pyruvate kinase also replaced "adult type" pyruvate kinase vitro. concluded findings fetal mouseliver cultured circumfusion system 2 weeks maintains functional morphological identitites differentiates toward adult liver.
