 estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) orphan nuclear receptor plays primary role regulation cellular energy homeostasis osteogenesis. reported ERRalpha widely expressed range tissues accumulating evidence supported high expression ERRalpha correlates poor prognosis various human malignancies, including breast, endometrium, colon, prostate ovary cancers. Herein described discovery novel selective inverse agonist (HSP1604) ERRalpha, ERRbeta ERRgamma, determined using transient transfection luciferase reporter assay time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) co-activator assay. HSP1604 potently inhibits ERRalpha transcriptional activity IC50=1.47+/-0.17muM cell-based luciferase reporter assay also decreases protein level ERRalpha mRNA levels downstream target genes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), pS2 osteopontin. HSP1604 also suppressed proliferation different human cancer cell lines migration breast cancer cells high expression ERRalpha. Representative vivo results show HSP1604 suppresses growth human breast cancer xenograft nude mice doses 30mg/kg 100mg/kg administered every day 28-day period. HSP1604 thus potential new agent inhibit growth tumors chemical probe ERRalpha biology.
