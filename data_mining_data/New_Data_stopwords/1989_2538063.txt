 Renal proximal tubular epithelia used assess factors responsible induction glycolysis cultured cells. Primary cultures rabbit proximal tubules, achieved confluency 6 days, exhibited hormonal responsiveness brush-border characteristics typical proximal tubular cells. Beginning day 4, cultured cells exhibited increased glycolytic metabolism reflected enhanced glucose uptake lactate production, along parallel increases activity glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FDP), downregulated, cultured cells exhibited lower oxygen consumption rates fresh tubules. Cells grown rocker, mitigate hypoxia, exhibited metabolic enzymatic profile similar cells grown still conditions. ATP levels cultured cells higher fresh tubules. Furthermore, pyruvate kinase activity higher cells grown media containing 0.5 contrasted 25 mM glucose. enhanced glycolytic metabolism exhibited cultured proximal tubular cells appears characteristic proliferation response hypoxia, Pasteur effect, environmental glucose.
