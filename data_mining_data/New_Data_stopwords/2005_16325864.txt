 Integrating biological information different sources understand cellular processes important problem systems biology. use data mRNA expression arrays chemical kinetics formulate metabolic model relevant K562 erythroleukemia cells. MAP kinase pathway activation alters expression metabolic enzymes K562 cells. array data show changes expression lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoforms treatment phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), activates MAP kinase signaling. model change lactate production occurs MAP kinase pathway activated, using non-equilibrium, chemical-kinetic model homolactic fermentation. particular, examine role LDH isoforms, catalyse conversion pyruvate lactate. Changes isoform ratio primary determinant production lactate. Rather, total concentration LDH controls lactate concentration.
