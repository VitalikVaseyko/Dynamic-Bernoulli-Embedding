 Changes gene expression recovery high-intensity, intermittent, one-legged exercise studied 5.5 wk training. Genes related metabolism, well Na+, K+, pH homeostasis, selected analyses. work performed training period, several muscle biopsies obtained vastus lateralis muscle. untrained state, Na+-K+-ATPase alpha1-subunit mRNA level approximately threefold higher (P < 0.01) 0, 1, 3 h exercise, relative preexercise resting level. 3-5 h recovery untrained state, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 hexokinase II mRNA levels elevated 13-fold (P < 0.001) 6-fold (P < 0.01), respectively. However, training period, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA levels elevated (P < 0.05) recovery period. changes resting mRNA levels observed result training. conclusion, cellular adaptations high-intensity exercise training may, part, induced transcriptional regulation. training, transcriptional response exercise bout given workload diminished.
