 aim study investigate mRNA response related mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolism, angiogenesis, myogenesis trained human skeletal muscle speed endurance exercise (S), endurance exercise (E), speed endurance followed endurance exercise (S + E). Seventeen trained male subjects (maximum oxygen uptake (VO2-max): 57.2 +/- 3.7 (mean +/- SD) mL.min(-1).kg(-1)) performed (6 x 30 sec all-out), E (60 min ~60% VO2-max), + E cycle ergometer separate occasions. Muscle biopsies obtained rest 1, 2, 3 h speed endurance exercise (S + E) rest, 0, 1, 2 h exercise E + E, muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1alpha) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) mRNA higher (P < 0.05) 2 3 h speed endurance exercise rest. Muscle PGC-1alpha PDK4 mRNA levels higher (P < 0.05) exercise + E E, higher (P < 0.05) E exercise. + E, muscle vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA higher (P < 0.05) 1 (S only), 2 3 h speed endurance exercise rest. + E, muscle regulatory factor-4 muscle heme oxygenase-1 mRNA higher (P < 0.05) 1, 2, 3 h speed endurance exercise rest. S, muscle hexokinase II mRNA higher (P < 0.05) 2 3 h speed endurance exercise rest higher (P < 0.05) E exercise. findings suggest trained subjects, speed endurance exercise provides stimulus muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, substrate regulation, angiogenesis evident endurance exercise. responses reinforced speed endurance exercise followed endurance exercise.
