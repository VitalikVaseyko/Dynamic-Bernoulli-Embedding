 Incubation fetal hepatocytes 21-day-old rats permeant derivatives cyclic AMP (cAMP) glucagon, increased mRNA levels 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2), L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Contrary behavior, adult hepatocytes exhibited decrease PFK-2/FBPase-2 L-PK mRNA levels incubated equivalent experimental conditions. Dexamethasone also increased PFK-2/FBPase-2 mRNA levels costimulation fetal hepatocytes dexamethasone permeant analogue cyclic AMP enhanced levels PFK-2/FBPase-2 mRNA, situation opposite exhibited adult hepatocytes. Treatment hepatocytes transcriptional translational inhibitors also produced differential responses types cells. PFK-2/FBPase-2 mRNA fetal hepatocytes stable adult cells. results suggest specific transcriptional factors regulatory pathways differentially operate fetal adult hepatocytes control responses carbohydrate metabolism cAMP.
