 7WD4 7PA2 cell lines, widely used cellular models Alzheimer's disease (AD), used investigate effects amyloid-beta protein precursor overexpression amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomer accumulation mitochondrial function. standard culture conditions, cell lines, compared Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) control cells, displayed ~5% decrease O2 respiration sustained endogenous substrates. Functional impairment respiratory chain found distributed among protein complexes, though evident level complex complex IV. Measurements ATP showed synthesis oxidative phosphorylation decreased 7WD4 7PA2 cells ~25%, loss partly compensated glycolysis (Warburg effect). Compensation proved efficient 7WD4 7PA2 cells, latter cell line displaying highest reactive oxygen species production. strongest deficit observed mitochondrial membrane potential almost 40% 60% lower 7WD4 7PA2 cells, respectively, comparison CHO controls. functional parameters point severe bioenergetic impairment AD cells, extent mitochondrial dysfunction correlated accumulation Abeta peptides oligomers.
