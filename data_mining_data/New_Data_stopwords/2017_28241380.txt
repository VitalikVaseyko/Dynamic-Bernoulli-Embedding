 fast approximate method generating allosteric communication landscapes proteins presented using Schreiber's entropy transfer concept combination Gaussian Network Model proteins. Predictions model allosteric communication landscapes generated show information transfer proteins necessarily take place along single path, ensemble pathways possible. model emphasizes knowledge entropy sufficient determining allosteric communication additional information based time delayed correlations introduced, leads presence causality proteins. model provides simple tool mapping entropy sink-source relations pairs residues. approach, residues manipulated control protein activity may determined. great importance allosteric drug design understanding effects mutations function. model applied determine allosteric communication three proteins, Ubiquitin, Pyruvate Kinase, PDZ domain. Predictions agreement molecular dynamics simulations experimental evidence. Proteins 2017; 85:1056-1064. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
