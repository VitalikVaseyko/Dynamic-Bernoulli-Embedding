 solid tumors characterized metabolic shift glucose oxidation glycolysis, part due actively suppressed mitochondrial function, state favors resistance apoptosis. Suppressed mitochondrial function may also contribute activation hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) angiogenesis. previously shown inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) dichloroacetate (DCA) activates glucose oxidation induces apoptosis cancer cells vitro vivo. hypothesized DCA also reverse 'pseudohypoxic' mitochondrial signals lead HIF1alpha activation cancer, even absence hypoxia inhibit cancer angiogenesis. show inhibition PDKII inhibits HIF1alpha cancer cells using several techniques, including HIF1alpha luciferase reporter assays. Using pharmacologic molecular approaches suppress prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD)-mediated inhibition HIF1alpha, show DCA inhibits HIF1alpha PHD-dependent mechanism (that involves DCA-induced increase production mitochondria-derived alpha-ketoglutarate) PHD-independent mechanism, involving activation p53 via mitochondrial-derived H(2)O(2), well activation GSK3beta. Effective inhibition HIF1alpha shown decrease expression several HIF1alpha regulated gene products well inhibition angiogenesis vitro matrigel assays. importantly, rat xenotransplant models non-small cell lung cancer breast cancer, show effective inhibition angiogenesis tumor perfusion vivo, assessed contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, nuclear imaging techniques histology. work suggests mitochondria-targeting metabolic modulators increase pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, addition recently described pro-apoptotic anti-proliferative effects, suppress angiogenesis well, normalizing pseudo-hypoxic signals lead normoxic HIF1alpha activation solid tumors.
