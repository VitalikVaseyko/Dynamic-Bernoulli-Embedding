 Diabetes menacing problem, particularly inhabitants groundwater arsenic contaminated areas needing new medical approaches. study examines PLGA loaded nano-insulin (NIn), administered either intraperitoneally (i.p.) oral route, greater cost-effective anti-hyperglycemic potential insulin chronically arsenite-fed hyperglycemic mice. particle size, morphology zeta potential nano-insulin determined using dynamic light scattering method, scanning electronic atomic force microscopies. ability nano-insulin (NIn) cross blood-brain barrier (BBB) also checked. Circular dichroic spectroscopic (CD) data insulin nano-insulin presence absence arsenic compared. Several diabetic markers different groups experimental control mice assessed. mitochondrial functioning indices like cytochrome c, pyruvate-kinase, glucokinase, ATP/ADP ratio, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell membrane potential calcium-ion level also evaluated. Expressions relevant marker proteins mRNAs like insulin, GLUT2, GLUT4, IRS1, IRS2, UCP2, PI3, PPARgamma, CYP1A1, Bcl2, caspase3 p38 tracking-down signaling cascade also analyzed. Results revealed i.p.-injected nano-encapsulated-insulin showed better results; NIn, due smaller size, faster mobility, site-specific release, could cross BBB showed positive modulation mitochondrial signaling cascades downstream signaling molecules reducing arsenic-induced-hyperglycemia. CD data indicated nano-insulin less distorted secondary structure compared insulin presence arsenic. Thus, overall analyses revealed PLGA nano-insulin showed better efficacy combating arsenite-induced-hyperglycemia insulin therefore, greater potentials use nano-encapsulated form.
