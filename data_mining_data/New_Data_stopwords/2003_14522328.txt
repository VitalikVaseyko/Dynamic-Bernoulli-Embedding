 BACKGROUND: Dichloroacetate (DCA) drug allows pyruvate dehydrogenase remain active anaerobic conditions inhibiting inactivating enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. hypothesize administration DCA acute limb ischemia may beneficial effect reducing severity anaerobic metabolism lessening irreversible injury. STUDY DESIGN: studied rabbit model using unilateral ligation iliac artery femoral artery evaluate two degrees ischemia. 2 hours hind-limb ischemia, animals administered IV DCA (15 mg/kg) equivalent volume saline. RESULTS: Higher serum lactate levels seen high compared low ligation control animals consistent severe ischemia. DCA treatment significantly reduced serum lactate levels high low ligation. Similarly, rise percentage end-tidal CO(2) reperfusion less DCA. animals regained hind-limb function procedure, ischemia reperfusion resulted appreciable muscle necrosis (> 10% area) 50% high- 22% low-ligation control animals. DCA treatment eliminated significant muscle necrosis 100% high-ligation animals. Muscle histology similar control DCA-treated low-ligation animals. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment DCA acute arterial occlusion significantly lower markers anaerobic metabolism reduced muscle necrosis rabbit model acute hind-limb ischemia. DCA delivery collateral blood flow may prolong ischemia time interval onset irreversible muscle injury potential limb loss.
