 human platelets incubated 500 nM-PAF-acether (platelet-activating factor. 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) equilibrium conditions (60 min, 22 degrees C, non-stirred suspensions), two classes fibrinogen binding sites exposed: one class high affinity [Kd (7.2 +/- 2.1) X 10(-8) M, 2367 +/- 485 sites/platelet, n = 9] one class low affinity [Kd (5.9 +/- 2.4) X 10(-7) M, 26972 +/- 8267 sites/platelet]. Preincubation inhibitors cyclo-oxygenase (acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin) thromboxane synthetase (UK 38.485) completely abolishes high-affinity binding, leaving low-affinity binding unchanged. contrast, ADP scavengers (phosphocreatine/creatine kinase phosphoenol pyruvate/pyruvate kinase) completely prevent low-affinity binding, leaving high-affinity binding unaltered. Initial binding studies (2-10 min incubation) confirm findings major part binding sensitive ADP scavengers, minor part sensitive indomethacin complete blockade inhibitors. Increasing temperature 37 degrees C decreases number low affinity-binding sites 6-fold without changing high-affinity binding. Aggregation, measured rate single platelet disappearance, depends high-affinity binding 10 nM-fibrinogen less, whereas 100 nM-fibrinogen low-affinity binding becomes predominant. findings point considerable platelet activation binding experiments. However, arachidonate metabolism [( 3H]arachidonate mobilization thromboxane synthesis) secretion [( 14C]serotonin beta-thromboglobulin) 10% less amounts found optimal conditions (5 units thrombin/ml 37 degrees C, stirring). conclude PAF-acether induces little platelet activation binding conditions. amounts thromboxane A2 secreted ADP, however, sufficient initiating high- low-affinity fibrinogen binding via mutually independent mechanisms.
