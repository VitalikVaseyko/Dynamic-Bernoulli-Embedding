 Increased conversion glucose lactate key feature many cancer cells promotes rapid growth. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression increased facilitates lactate production cancer cells. Modulation PKM2 catalytic activity also regulates synthesis DNA lipids required cell proliferation, NADPH required redox homeostasis. addition role pyruvate kinase, PKM2 also functions protein kinase transcriptional coactivator. biochemical activities controlled allosteric regulators post-translational modifications PKM2 include acetylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, prolyl hydroxylation, sumoylation. Given pleiotropic effects cancer biology, PKM2 represents attractive target cancer therapy.
