 BACKGROUND: Athletes consume arginine and/or aspartate potential nutritional ergogenics. metabolic effects controversial evidence ingestion large doses single amino acids adversely affect nitrogen balance induce amino acid imbalance. Nevertheless, general metabolic influence arginine aspartate supplementation prolonged exercise bout yet investigated. AIM STUDY: aim study was, therefore, investigate general metabolic impact chronic supplementation arginine aspartate endurance-trained athletes rest marathon run. METHODS: Fourteen endurance-trained runners participated field study carried according double-blind crossover design. 15 g arginine aspartate carbohydrate-based placebo supplemented daily 14 days marathon run. Blood samples analysis metabolites hormones collected shortly run, 31 km, end run, recovery period two hours. Additionally, respiratory exchange ratio determined run. RESULTS: plasma level carbohydrate (glucose, lactate, pyruvate) fat metabolites (fatty acids, glycerol, beta-hydroxybutyrate), cortisol, insulin, ammonia, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase well respiratory exchange ratio unaffected supplementation. contrast, plasma level somatotropic hormone, glucagon, urea, arginine significantly increased, level remaining plasma amino acids well sum significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: obvious metabolic benefit derived chronic supplementation arginine aspartate. since furthermore consequences reduction total plasma amino acid level known, practice using single amino acid supplements potential ergogenics critically reevaluated.
