 Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer term group cancers affecting digestive system. binding neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor, undecapeptide substance P (SP) regulates GI cancer cell proliferation migration invasion metastasis, controls endothelial cell proliferation angiogenesis. SP also exerts antiapoptotic effect. SP NK-1 receptor located GI tumor cells, NK-1 receptor overexpressed. contrast, binding NK-1 receptor, NK-1 receptor antagonists elicit inhibition (epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition) proliferation GI cancer cells concentration-dependent manner, induce death GI cancer cells apoptosis, counteract Warburg effect, inhibit cancer cell migration (counteracting invasion metastasis), inhibit angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition). NK-1 receptor antagonists safe well tolerated. Thus, NK-1 receptor could considered new target GI cancer NK-1 receptor antagonists (eg, aprepitant) could new promising approach treatment GI cancer.
