 Experiments performed eight subjects affected peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) lower limbs. patient submitted Ecodoppler, angiography "Treadmill test". Two bioptic muscle patients. sample used spectrophotometric spectrophotofluorimetric determinations of: glycogen, pyruvate, lactate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, aspartate, glutamate, AMP, ADP, ATP creatine phosphate (CP). bioptic sample used determine following enzyme activities: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, total NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome oxidase, aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase. Patients showed increase lactate dehydrogenase, total NADH cytochrome c reductase succinate dehydrogenase activities, decrease glycogen, ATP CP concentrations. Telethermographic data showed patient muscle thermic emission quantitatively different control group. telethermographic test used additional diagnostic tool determine monitor efficiency muscle undergoing metabolic failure.
