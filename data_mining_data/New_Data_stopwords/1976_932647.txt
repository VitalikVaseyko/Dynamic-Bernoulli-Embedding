 rate distribution cell enzymes intravascular extravascular space studied, following sudden decrease enzyme activities plasma. rapid decrease enzyme activities achieved rats rapid exchange blood twofold volume suspension homologous erythrocytes isoosmolar bovine serum albumin solution. plasmapheresis, activities seven cell enzymes plasma decreased 14 22% original values. subsequent increase activities showed different kinetics, depending enzyme. 120 min, creatine kinase reached starting activity; malate dehydrogenase aldolase reached original activities 180 min. Aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase pyruvate kinase increased slowly still reached starting values 240 min. Repetition plasmapheresis 90 min obvious effect kinetics subsequent activity increase. first minutes plasmapheresis adjustment activity equilibrium interstitial intravascular compartments depends mainly capillary permeability. therefore possible determine half-life constants distribution enzymes within extracellular space. constants malate dehydrogenase aldolase almost identical determined intravenous injection, whereas discrepancies constants remaining enzymes. constants pyruvate kinase glutamate dehydrogenase significantly lower, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase creatine kinase significantly higher, determined intravenous injection. Possible reasons differences disucssed.
