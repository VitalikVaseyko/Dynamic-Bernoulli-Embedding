 activity 18 red blood cell (RBC) enzymes reduced glutathione (GSH) content measured 70 normal subjects, 50 heterozygous beta-thalassaemia carriers 50 non-thalassaemic patients haemolytic anaemia high reticulocyte counts. addition, pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase (P5N) activity also determined 34 patients hypochromic, microcytic, iron deficiency anaemia. beta-Thalassaemia trait associated increase almost enzyme activities, except 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthetase (BPGS) glutathione reductase (GR) normal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) P5N slightly markedly decreased respectively. increases enzyme activities similar observed patients non-thalassaemic reticulocytosis except glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD), phosphoglyceratekinase (PGK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) adenylate kinase (AK) higher non-thalassaemic group patients increased number reticulocytes. correlation found severity P5N deficiency intensity basophilic stippling present 46 50 thalassaemic carriers studied. addition, GSH content UV absorption spectra deproteinized thalassaemic RBC extracts also found normal. present findings provide information metabolic status RBC beta-thalassaemia trait suggest possible molecular explanation frequently observed basophilic stippling disease.
