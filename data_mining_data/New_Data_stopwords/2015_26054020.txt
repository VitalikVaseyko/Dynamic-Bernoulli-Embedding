 UNLABELLED: Cancer cells possess unique metabolic phenotype allows preferentially utilize glucose aerobic glycolysis. phenomenon referred "Warburg effect." Accumulating evidence suggests microRNAs (miRNAs), class small noncoding regulatory RNAs, interact oncogenes/tumor suppressors induce metabolic reprograming cancer cells. systematically study metabolic roles miRNAs cancer cells, developed gain-of-function miRNA screen HeLa cells. Subsequent investigation characterized miRNAs indicated miR-199a-5p acts suppressor glucose metabolism. Furthermore, miR-199a-5p often down-regulated human liver cancer, low expression level correlated low survival rate, large tumor size, poor tumor differentiation status, high tumor-node-metastasis stage presence tumor thrombus patients. MicroRNA-199a-5p directly targets 3'-untranslated region hexokinase 2 (HK2), enzyme catalyzes irreversible first step glycolysis, thereby suppressing glucose consumption, lactate production, cellular glucose-6-phosphate adenosine triphosphate levels, cell proliferation, tumorigenesis liver cancer cells. Moreover, HK2 frequently up-regulated liver cancer tissues associated poor patient outcomes. up-regulation hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha hypoxic conditions suppresses expression miR-199a-5p promotes glycolysis, whereas reintroduction miR-199a-5p interferes expression HK2, abrogating hypoxia-enhanced glycolysis. CONCLUSION: miR-199a-5p/HK2 reprograms metabolic process liver cancer cells provides potential prognostic predictors liver cancer patients.
