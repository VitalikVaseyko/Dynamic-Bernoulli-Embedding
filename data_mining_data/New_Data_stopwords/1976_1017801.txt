 Pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities determined microdissected freeze-dried liver cells periportal pericentral area liver lobule. Pyruvate kinase activity measured microfluorimetric procedure adapted 20-200 ng tissue dry weight. livers fed rats, activity twice high central zone periportal cells; starvation reduced gradient decreasing central activities. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity measured microradiochemical technique 100-300 ng tissue dry weight. livers fed rats, enzyme nearly 3 times active periportal cells central area. Starvation increased enzyme zones pronounced change central cells. results indicate heterogeneous distribution enzymes carbohydrate metabolism liver lobule. Gluconegenesis seems localized preferentially periportal hepatocytes, whereas glycolytic enzyme found active cells surrounding pericentral liver cells.
