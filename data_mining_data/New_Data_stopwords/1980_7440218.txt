 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase twelve patients hereditary erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency investigated according recommended methods characterization red cell pyruvate kinase variants. Family members also studied. Abnormalities frequently noted affinity substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate; allosteric activator, fructose-1,6-diphosphate; allosteric inhibitor, ATP; also heat stability electrophoretic pattern. Several different PK variants identified. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed presence immature activity bands red cells patients. bands presumably represent residuals isozymes produced evolution erythrocyte PK, may occur compensatory mechanism defective isozyme.
