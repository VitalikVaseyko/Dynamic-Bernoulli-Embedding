 Myocardial functional recovery creatine kinase (CK) release following various periods ischaemia investigated isolated mouse hearts. hearts perfused Langendorff mode pyruvate-containing Krebs-Hensleit (KH) buffer constant perfusion pressure 80 mmHg, subjected either continuous perfusion 5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 60 min global ischaemia followed 45 min reperfusion. hearts subjected ischaemic periods 5, 15 20 min, transient reduction left ventricular (LV) dP/dt max early phase reperfusion, recovery end reperfusion reached level similar hearts subjected continuous perfusion. hearts subjected longer ischaemic periods, i.e. 25, 30, 45 60 min, decrease cardiac performance pronounced persistent, significantly lower recovery LV dP/dt max higher LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) end reperfusion non-ischaemic hearts. significant differences recoveries coronary flow heart rate (HR) groups. Similarly functional recovery, release CK showed clear ischaemic length-related increase. conclusion, Langendorff-perfused isolated mouse heart could valuable model studies myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Future studies using gene-targeted mice would add valuable knowledge understanding myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury.
