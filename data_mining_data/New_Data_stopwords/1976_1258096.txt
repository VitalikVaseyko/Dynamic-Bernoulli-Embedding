 activities six intra-erythrocytic enzymes--glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, triosephosphate-isomerase phosphoglucomutase--have measured euthyroid probands (n=18) hyperthyroid patients (n=13) prior radioiodine therapy stabilization metabolic conditions. hexokinase, triosephosphate-isomerase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase show significant changes. moderate diminution aldolase activity distinct decrease phosphoglucomutase activity occur hyperthyroidism. normalization metabolic conditions, enzymatic activities increase again.
