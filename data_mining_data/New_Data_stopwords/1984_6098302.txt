 (Sp)-2'-Deoxyadenosine 5'-O-[1-17O,1-18O,1,2-18O]triphosphate synthesized desulfurization (Sp)-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-(1-thio[1,1-18O2]diphosphate) N-bromosuccinimide [17O]water, followed phosphorylation phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase. careful characterization product using high-resolution 31P NMR revealed desulfurization reaction proceeded approximately 88% direct in-line attack alpha-phosphorus 12% participation beta-phosphate form cyclic alpha,beta-diphosphate. latter intermediate underwent hydrolysis predominant nucleophilic attack beta-phosphate. complexity desulfurization reaction, however, affect stereochemical integrity product rather causes minor dilution nonchiral species. usefulness (Sp)-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-[1-17O,1-18O,1,2-18O]triphosphate determining stereochemical course deoxyribonucleotidyl-transfer enzymes demonstrated using delineate stereochemical course 3'----5'-exonuclease activity DNA polymerase I. Upon incubation oxygen-chiral substrate Klenow fragment DNA polymerase presence poly[d(A-T)] Mg2+, quantitative conversion 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-[16O,17O,18O]monophosphate observed. stereochemistry product determined Rp. Since overall template-primer-dependent conversion deoxynucleoside triphosphate deoxynucleoside monophosphate involves incorporation polymer followed excision 3'----5'-exonuclease activity since stereochemical course incorporation reaction known inversion, concluded stereochemical course 3'----5'-exonuclease also inversion.
