 study aimed increase glycolytic flux multivitamin auxotrophic yeast Torulopsis glabrata redirecting NADH oxidation oxidative phosphorylation membrane-bound ferric reductase. added potassium ferricyanide electron acceptor T. glabrata culture broth 20% dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, resulted in: (1) decreases NADH content, NADH/NAD(+) ratio, ATP level 45.3%, 60.3%, 15.2%, respectively; (2) high activities key glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, well high expression levels genes encoding enzymes; (3) increases specific glucose consumption rate pyruvate yield T. glabrata 45.5% 23.1%, respectively. results showed membrane-bound ferric reductase offers alternative efficient NADH oxidation pathway lower concentration, increases glycolytic flux T. glabrata.
