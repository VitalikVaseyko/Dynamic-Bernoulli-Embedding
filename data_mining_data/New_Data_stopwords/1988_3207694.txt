 Two new reactive nucleotides synthesized characterized: 8-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]adenosine 5'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate (8-BDB-TADP 8-BDB-TATP). ADP ATP converted 8-thio-ADP (-ATP) via 8-bromo-ADP (-ATP), followed condensation 1,4-dibromobutanedione. Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase inactivated reagents biphasic manner initial rapid loss 75% activity, followed slow total inactivation. initial fast reaction compounds exhibits nonlinear dependence reagent concentration, indicating formation reversible enzyme-reagent complex prior covalent attachment. presence gamma-phosphoryl group improves performance affinity label: KI values fast phase similar (about 100 microM), whereas kmax 8-BDB-TATP three times greater 8-BDB-TADP (0.286 min-1 vs 0.0835 min-1). 80-min incubation 175 microM either reagent, 2 mol/mol subunit incorporated 76% inactivation caused 8-BDB-TADP 97% inactivation 8-BDB-TATP. Loss activity prevented substrates, best protection afforded combination ATP, Mn2+, K+, phosphoenolpyruvate. Reaction pyruvate kinase either compound presence protecting ligands leads incorporation 1 mol reagent/mol subunit 15% loss activity. results suggest 8-BDB-TADP 8-BDB-TATP react two groups enzyme, one near active site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
