 HNF1beta expressed exclusively ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) ovarian cancers, regarded hallmark tumor. implies central role unique character OCCC, including resistance chemotherapy, exact role influence cancer biology molecular bases function largely unknown. Using comprehensive metabolome analysis HNF1beta_shRNA-stable cell lines, show HNF1beta drastically alters intracellular metabolism, especially direction enhance aerobic glycolysis, called "Warburg effect". consequence metabolic change contributed cell survival stresses hypoxia chemo-reagent, sufficient glucose supply available. Augmented cell survival based reduced ROS activity derived metabolic alteration shift oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis increased intracellular anti-oxidant, glutathione (GSH). One cystine transporters, rBAT likely play major role GSH increase. data suggest HNF1beta, possibly induced stressful microenvironment endometriotic cyst, confers survival advantage epithelial cells, leads occurrence OCCC, chemo-resistant phenotype ovarian cancer.
