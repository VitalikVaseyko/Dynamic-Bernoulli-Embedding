 influence hypoglycemic agent glipizide (0-100 microM) rate gluconeogenesis lactate, well levels fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, investigated hepatocytes isolated genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats corresponding lean (Fa/-) littermates. compared lean rat hepatocytes, liver cells isolated obese animals showed lower rate basal gluconeogenesis (0.9 +/- 0.2 vs 5.4 +/- 0.5 micromol lactate converted glucose/g cell x 30 min, n=4) higher levels fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (11.5 +/- 1.0 vs 5.9 +/- 0.4 nmol/g cell, n=8-9). lean rat hepatocytes, presence glipizide incubation medium caused dose-dependent inhibition rate lactate conversion glucose (maximal inhibition=46%; EC50 value=26 microM), simultaneously raised cellular content fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (maximal increment=40%; EC50 value=10 microM). contrast, hepatocytes isolated obese rats, inhibition gluconeogenesis increment fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels elicited glipizide significantly reduced (maximal effects 22 13%, respectively). Similarly, activation glycogen phosphorylase increase hexose 6-phosphate levels response glipizide less marked obese rat hepatocytes liver cells isolated lean animals. results demonstrate efficacy sulfonylureas inhibitors hepatic gluconeogenesis reduced genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rat.
