 OBJECTIVES: purpose study determine whether sodium dichloroacetate improves hemodynamic performance mechanical efficiency congestive heart failure. BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure associated impaired hemodynamic performance reduced mechanical efficiency. Dichloroacetate stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, results inhibition free fatty acid metabolism stimulation high respiratory quotient glucose lactate consumption heart. Facilitation glucose lactate consumption dichloroacetate improve mechanical efficiency failing ventricle. METHODS: Ten patients New York Heart Association functional class III IV congestive heart failure studied. Dichloroacetate (50 mg/kg body weight) administered intravenously 30 min, measurements hemodynamic variables, coronary sinus blood flow blood gas, glucose lactate levels 2 h. patients also given dobutamine (5 12.5 micrograms/kg per min) comparison. RESULTS: Therapeutic levels dichloroacetate achieved (100 160 micrograms/liter plasma). Myocardial consumption lactate stimulated 29% 37.4%. Forward stroke volumes increased (+5.3 ml/beat, p < 0.02), left ventricular stroke work (+1.8 g-m/m2 per beat, p < 0.02) left ventricular minute work (from 1.38 1.55 kg-m/m2 per min, p < 0.01). Myocardial oxygen consumption decreased (from 19.3 16.5 ml/min, p = 0.06) left ventricular minute work increased. Left ventricular mechanical efficiency thus improved 15.2% 20.6% (p = 0.03). Dobutamine administration resulted opposite trend respect myocardial lactate extraction (from 34% 15.3%, p < 0.02). Stroke volume increased (+7.4 ml/beat, p = NS vs. dichloroacetate), left ventricular minute work (from 1.29 1.59 g-m/m2 per min, p < 0.01 vs. dichloroacetate) myocardial oxygen consumption (from 18.6 21.0 ml/min, p = 0.06 vs. dichloroacetate). Left ventricular mechanical efficiency change dobutamine administration (from 16.4% 15.8%, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Dichloroacetate administration stimulates myocardial lactate consumption improves left ventricular mechanical efficiency. Forward stroke volume left ventricular minute work increase significantly, simultaneous reduction myocardial oxygen consumption. Dobutamine administration results similar hemodynamic improvements change left ventricular mechanical efficiency opposite effects lactate metabolism. opposing metabolic actions, yet similar hemodynamic responses, dichloroacetate dobutamine suggest agents may complementary treatment congestive heart failure.
