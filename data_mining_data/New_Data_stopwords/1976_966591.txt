 tissue culture, lens epithelia iris cells survive concentrations 0.5 mg pilocarpine/100 ml TCM, even better 0.25 mg/100 ml. means Warburg-method Boehringer's Glukotest, consumption oxygen glucose measured without addition pilocarpine. oxygen-uptake epithelia decreased one third addition drug, doubled iris cells. reveals compensating effect iris tissue protecting epithelia. Pilocarpine inhibited consumption glucose tissues, significantly. Consequently, dealing cataractogenuous substance. gives new light upon Hockwin's so-called "Additions-katarakt".
