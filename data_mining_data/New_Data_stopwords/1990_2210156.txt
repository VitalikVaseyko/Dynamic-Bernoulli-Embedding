 Genetics powerful tool analyzing metabolic regulation bacteria, permitting definitive identification key regulatory enzymes, assignment cause effect relationships molecular mechanisms control activity regulatory enzymes flow metabolites pathways intermediary metabolism. homeothermic vertebrates, however, traditional genetic analysis metabolic regulation difficult impossible. Despite enormous amount factual information metabolic pathways vertebrates, understanding regulatory mechanisms based largely correlations regulation activity purified enzyme effector variations intracellular concentration effector conditions modulate flow metabolites relevant metabolic pathway. Newly developed molecular genetic gene transfer methods used study metabolic regulation vertebrates. methods described short reviews mechanisms diet, hormones, tissue-type regulate transcription genes L-type pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Application techniques analyses structure/function intact cells animals illustrated recent work receptor low density lipoproteins cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases.
