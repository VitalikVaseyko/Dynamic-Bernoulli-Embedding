 BACKGROUND: Methionine essential amino acid fish. present study conducted investigate effects dietary methionine growth performance, digestive absorptive ability, well antioxidant capacity intestine hepatopancreas sub-adult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). RESULTS: Dietary methionine deficiency significantly decreased percentage weight gain (PWG), feed intake, feed efficiency protein efficiency ratio, well activities hepatopancreatic glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase muscle glutamate-pyruvate transaminase sub-adult grass carp (P < 0.05). Furthermore, methionine deficiency significantly reduced activities trypsin, lipase amylase intestine, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase three intestinal segments, creatine kinase (CK) proximal intestine (P < 0.05). However, unexplained significant increase CK activity mid intestine associated dietary methionine deficiency. Malondialdehyde protein carbonyl contents intestine hepatopancreas significantly increased methionine deficiency (P < 0.05), whereas anti-hydroxyl radical capacity hepatopancreas intestine, anti-superoxide anion capacity intestine, significantly decreased methionine deficiency (P < 0.05). Moreover, methionine deficiency significantly decreased superoxide dismutase glutathione reductase activities, glutathione contents hepatopancreas intestine, well glutathione peroxidase activity intestine (P < 0.05), whereas significantly increased activities catalase hepatopancreas glutathione-S-transferase hepatopancreas intestine (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: present results demonstrated dietary methionine deficiency induced poor growth, decreased digestive absorptive function antioxidant capacity hepatopancreas intestine sub-adult grass carp. Methionine requirements sub-adult grass carp (450-1, 170 g) based PWG, intestinal trypsin, hepatopancreatic anti-hydroxyl radical activities estimated 6.12 g/kg diet (21.80 g/kg protein), 6.99 g/kg diet (24.90 g/kg protein) 5.42 g/kg diet (19.31 g/kg protein), respectively, presence 1.50 g cysteine/kg (5.35 g/kg protein).
