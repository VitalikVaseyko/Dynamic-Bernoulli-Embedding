 Overexpression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), especially PDK1 observed variety cancers. Thus, targeting PDK1 offers attractive opportunity development cancer therapies. letter, reported identification two novel PDK1 inhibitors anti-osteosarcoma agents. found TM-1 TM-2 inhibited PDK1 IC50 values 2.97 3.41muM, respectively. Furthermore, TM-1 TM-2 dose-dependently reduced phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. Finally, TM-1 TM-2 found inhibit proliferation MG-63 cells EC50 values 14.5, 11.0muM, respectively, meaning TM-1 TM-2 could promising leads discovery potent PDK1 inhibitors.
