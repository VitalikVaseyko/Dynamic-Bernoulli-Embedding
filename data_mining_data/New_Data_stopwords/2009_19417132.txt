 Solid tumors often develop acidic environment due Warburg effect. effectiveness diagnosis therapy may therefore enhanced design use pH-sensitive agents target acidic tumors. Recently, novel technology introduced target acidic tumors using pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP), peptide inserts across cell membranes alpha-helix extracellular pH (pH(e)) acidic. study, expanded application pHLIP technology include positron emission tomography imaging acidic environment prostate tumors using (64)Cu conjugated pHLIP ((64)Cu-DOTA-pHLIP). Studies showed construct avidly accumulated LNCaP PC-3 tumors, higher uptake retention LNCaP tumors. Uptake correlated differences bulk pH(e) PC-3 LNCaP tumors measured magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments (31)P chemical shift pH(e) marker 3-aminopropylphosphonate. article introduces novel class noninvasive pH-selective positron emission tomography imaging agents opens new research directions diagnosis acidic solid tumors.
