 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) known promote tumourigenesis dimer formation p-PKM2Y105. Here, investigated whether SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) decreases p-PKM2Y105 expression and, thus, determines sensitivity sorafenib inhibiting nuclear-related function PKM2. Immunoprecipitation immunoblot confirmed effect SHP-1 PKM2Y105 dephosphorylation. Lactate production assayed cells tumor samples determine whether sorafenib reversed Warburg effect. Clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor samples assessed PKM2 expression. SHP-1 directly dephosphorylated PKM2 Y105 decreased proliferative activity PKM2; similar effects found sorafenib-treated HCC cells. PKM2 also found determine sensitivity targeted drugs, sorafenib, brivanib, sunitinib, SHP-1 activation. Significant sphere-forming activity found HCC cells stably expressing PKM2. Clinical findings suggest PKM2 acts predicting factor early recurrence patients HCC, particularly without known risk factors (63.6%). SHP-1 dephosphorylates PKM2 Y105 inhibit nuclear function PKM2 determines efficacy targeted drugs. Targeting PKM2 SHP-1 might provide new therapeutic insights patients HCC.
