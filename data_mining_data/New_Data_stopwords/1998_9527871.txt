 study designed determine whether metabolic adaptations developed frogs tolerate natural events hypothermic hypoxia would precondition liver ex vivo organ storage. metabolic responses frog, Rana castabiena, compared mammalian system (rat) throughout prolonged period organ storage. Livers rats frogs flushed stored UW solution 5 degrees C periods 24-96 h. frog livers, ATP maintained high constant first 24 h storage; values ranged 2.7 3.0 micro mol/g. Even 96 h cold storage, ATP remained > 1.0 micro mol/g. contrast, ATP levels stored rat livers dropped rapidly, 4 h ATP 1.2 micro mol/g. terms anaerobic endproduct accumulation, lactate levels rose 5.8 micro mol/g frog liver (over 96 h) 8.6 micro mol/g rat liver (over 24 h). difference flux glycolysis also reflected relative rates carbohydrate catabolism (i.e., glucose + lactate production). rate carbohydrate catabolism frog liver 0.74 micro mol/g/h compared 2.26 micro mol/g/h rat liver; Q10 value 6.2 estimated livers R. castabiena. assessment glycolytic enzyme activities revealed key differences responsiveness pyruvate kinase allosteric modifiers may responsible marked drop rate anaerobic energy production frog tissues. Although concept depressed metabolism lower vertebrate new, data presented study demonstrate depressed metabolic state achieved isolated livers R. castabiena simply cold exposure. respect clinical relevance, results study indicate energetics stored livers maintained effectively efficient reduction energy use combination slow, yet continuous, rate energy production facilitated glycolysis.
