 genetic study carried phenotype gene frequencies genetic markers eight red cell enzymes: glyoxalase (GLO1), glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT), phosphoglucomutase (PGM1), esterase (ESD), adenylate kinase (AK1), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD), adenosine deaminase (ADA), acid phosphatase (ACP1), Hungarian ethnic group living Yugoslavia. gene frequencies obtained were: GPT*1 = 0.542, PGM1*1 = 0.760, ESD*1 = 0.909, AK*1 = 0.971, PGD*A = 0.971, ADA*1 = 0.939, GLO1*1 = 0.417, ACP1*A = 0.329, ACP1*B = 0.591 ACP1*C = 0.080. distribution phenotype gene frequencies examined compared phenotype gene frequencies found Hungarian population living Hungary populations living northeast Yugoslavia.
