 mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase, plays pivotal roles integrating growth signals cellular level. support proliferation survival stress, two interacting complexes harbor mTOR, mTORC1 mTORC2, promote transcription genes involved carbohydrate metabolism lipogenesis, enhance protein translation, inhibit autophagy. Although rapamycin originally developed inhibitor cell proliferation preventing organ transplant rejection, molecular target, mTOR, subsequently identified central regulator metabolic cues drive lineage specification immune system. Owing oxidative stress, activation mTORC1 emerged central pathway pathogenesis systemic lupus erythematosus autoimmune diseases. Paradoxically, mTORC1 also identified mediator Warburg effect allows cell survival hypoxia. Rapamycin new classes mTOR inhibitors developed block transplant rejection autoimmunity also treat obesity various forms cancer. preventing diseases, personalized mTOR blockade holds promise extend life span.
