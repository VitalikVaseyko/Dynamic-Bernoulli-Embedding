 four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) two pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) isoenzymes present mammalian tissues regulate activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. effect lipoic acids activity PDKs PDPs investigated purified proteins system. R-lipoic acid, S-lipoic acid R-dihydrolipoic acid significantly affect activities PDPs time inhibited PDKs different extents (PDK1>PDK4 approximately PDK2>PDK3 R-LA). Since lipoic acids inhibited PDKs activity reconstituted PDC presence E1 alone, dissociation PDK lipoyl domains dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase presence lipoic acids likely explanation inhibition. activity PDK1 towards phosphorylation sites 1, 2 3 E1 decreased extent presence R-lipoic acid, thus excluding protection E1 active site lipoic acid phosphorylation. R-lipoic acid inhibited autophosphorylation PDK2 indicating exerted effect PDKs directly. Inhibition PDK1 R-lipoic acid altered ADP decreased presence pyruvate inhibits PDKs. inhibitory effect lipoic acid PDKs would result less phosphorylation E1 hence increased PDC activity. finding provides possible mechanism glucose (and lactate) lowering effect R-lipoic acid diabetic subjects.
