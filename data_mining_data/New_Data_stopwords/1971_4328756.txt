 Purified preparations Coxiella burnetii examined enzymes glycolytic pathway. Glucose-phosphate isomerase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase shown present C. burnetii extracts. Heat-killed C. burnetii purified normal yolk sacs demonstrated activity disruption. Aldolase shown class II type complete inhibition activity presence 8 x 10(-3)m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. host enzyme activity (normal infected yolk sacs) affected treatment. cellulose acetate electrophoresis performed extracts, aldolase normal infected yolk sacs exhibited five isozyme bands, whereas aldolase C. burnetii extract appeared single band.
