 Bioluminescent methods widely used assay co-factors, NADH ATP. Although bioluminescent method highly sensitive, enzymes used unstable expensive. Therefore chemiluminescent method would valuable clinical routine assay. developed chemiluminescent method assay NADH using 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methyl sulphate (1-MPMS)/isoluminol(IL)/microperoxidase(m-POD) system. order increase sensitivity method, enzymatic cycling system coupled chemiluminescent assay NADH. Alcohol dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase used cycling enzyme. standard curve obtained range 3 X 10(-14) 5 X 10(-12) mol/assay. detection limit NADH 30 fmol/assay comparable bioluminescent method using bacterial luciferase. Two chemiluminescent methods assay ATP developed. Method 1 system using hexokinase/G6PDH 1-PMS/IL/m-POD, method 2 system based enzymatic cycling reaction ATP using hexokinase/pyruvate kinase. Method 2 1000/fold sensitive method 1. detection limit ATP 10 fmol/assay.
