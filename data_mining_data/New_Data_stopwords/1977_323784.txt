 Kinetic studies semi-purified pyruvate kinase performed erythrocytes 22 subjects congenital non-spherocytic anemia pyruvate kinase deficiency 25 heterozygous relatives. study enzyme affinity PEP without ligands fructose-diphosphate (FDP) ATP allowed separate three groups patients: --in eight patients eleven heterozygous relatives, PK kinetic characteristics similar controls. Allosteric properties enzyme normal; --in three patients, PK activated form, non sensitive FDP activation ATP inhibition experimental conditions. deficient enzyme seemed present "R" form; --in eleven patients affinity PEP decreased; enzyme case activated FDP; however high FDP concentrations allow obtain complete activation n Hill 1. ATP inhibition important controls. Similar results obtained heterozygous relatives. pyruvate kineases patients seemed fixed "T" form. Whatever may molecular abnormalities responsible PK deficiency, seem lead many cases change enzyme allosteric properties.
