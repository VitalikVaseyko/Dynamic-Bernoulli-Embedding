 previously demonstrated rat long term exposure fatty acids inhibits B-cell function vivo vitro. assess clinical significance findings, tested human islets effects fatty acids glucose-induced insulin release biosynthesis pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Human islets obtained beta-Cell Transplant Unit (Brussels, Belgium). Exposure 0.125 mmol/L palmitate oleate 48 h tissue culture (RPMI-1640 5.5 mmol/L glucose) inhibited postculture insulin response 27 mmol/L glucose 40% 42% (P < 0.01 difference). Inhibition partly prevented coculture 1 mumol/L etomoxir, carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase-I inhibitor (P < 0.05 effect etomoxir). Inhibitory effects glucose-induced insulin secretion previous palmitate additive inhibitory effects exerted previous high glucose (11 27 mmol/L). Palmitate-induced inhibition insulin secretion evident exposure 25 mumol/L added fatty acid. insulin content islets exposed fatty acids significantly reduced, glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis inhibited 59% palmitate addition 51% oleate exposure (P < 0.01). effects partly prevented etomoxir (P < 0.05). activity PDH mitochondrial extracts islets preexposed 48 h palmitate decreased 35% (P < 0.05) vs. control islets, whereas activity PDH kinase (which inactivates PDH) significantly increased preparations (P < 0.05). effects ketones tested 48-h exposure beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-D-OHB). Ten millimoles D-beta-OHB per L inhibited subsequently tested insulin response 27 mmol/L glucose 56% (P < 0.001). Half-maximal inhibitory effects D-beta-OHB insulin secretion insulin content seen concentrations 0.5-2.5 mmol/L. Inhibition D-beta-OHB partially reversed etomoxir, whereas exposure D-beta-OHB failed affect PDH PDH kinase activities. conclude fatty acids well ketone bodies diminish B-cell responsiveness glucose human islets way glucose-fatty acid cycle. Increased plasma concentrations fatty acids ketones likely important factors behind negative influences B-cell function exerted diabetic state type 1 type 2 diabetes.
