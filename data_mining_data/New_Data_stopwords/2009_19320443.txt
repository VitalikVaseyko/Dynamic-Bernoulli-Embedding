 initial 26 amino acids human liver pyruvate kinase (L-PYK) present/observed crystal structure. region includes Ser12, site hormone-dependent phosphorylation. Truncating N-terminus L-PYK mimics effects phosphorylation causing decrease apparent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) affinity. N-terminus truncation series used map minimum number residues could removed result decrease apparent PEP affinity. Results consistent mechanism phosphorylation Ser12 interrupts activating interaction N-terminal residues (including positions 7-10) main body protein, means inhibiting substrate affinity.
