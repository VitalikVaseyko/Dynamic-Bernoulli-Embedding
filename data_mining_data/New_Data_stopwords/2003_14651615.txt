 Ferredoxin, Fd, often deficient metronidazole-resistant strains Trichomonas vaginalis thought necessary drug activation. directly test whether Fd essential metronidazole susceptibility, gene replacement technology developed T. vaginalis. selectable marker gene neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO) flanked approximately 2.6 approximately 2.0 kBp Fd 5' 3' flanking regions (pKO-FD-NEO) introduced cells linear DNA selected NEO gene expression. Stable transformants shown contain NEO gene Fd locus completely lost Fd gene. Northern immunoblot analyses confirm loss Fd mRNA protein pKO-FD-NEO cells. Analyses activity hydrogenosomal proteins Fd KO cells show fourfold increase hydrogenase activity 95% decrease pyruvate/ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO) activity. contrast, PFO hydrogenase mRNA levels unchanged. Surprisingly, Fd KO cells resistant metronidazole aerobic anaerobic conditions. cells capable producing molecular hydrogen, albeit 50% level parental strain, demonstrating Fd gene product eliminated KO cells neither necessary hydrogen production metronidazole activation. Together data indicate presence unidentified Fds flavodoxins capable drug activation unidentified mechanism require either PFO Fd metronidazole activation.
