 Plasma metabolites immunoreactive insulin (IRI) concentrations enzyme activities types peripheral leucocytes measured clarify one aspect differences nutrient metabolism dogs cats. significant differences plasma concentrations glucose, triglyceride, free fatty acids IRI dogs cats. Higher total cholesterol lower HDL cholesterol concentrations observed feline plasma, H/T ratio (HDL/total cholesterol concentrations) significantly lower canine plasma. cytosolic activities fructokinase (FK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) significantly higher activities cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH) mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) significantly lower feline leucocytes canine leucocytes. Higher activities FK, PK G6PD, regulate rate biosynthesis fatty acids, may reflect different characteristics nutrient metabolism feline tissues canine tissues.
