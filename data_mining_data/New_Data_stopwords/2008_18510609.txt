 OBJECTIVES: immunological fecal occult blood test (IFOBT) established precise marker colorectal cancer (CRC) screening traditional guaiac-based FOBT. simpler, cheaper, convenient newer office-based IFOBTs validated diagnosing CRC. Dimeric isoenzyme pyruvate kinase, M2-PK, expressed tumor cells, well proposed screening tool CRC. first study comparing fecal M2-PK screening biomarker CRC previously evaluated office-based IFOBT colonoscopy. METHODS: Six hundred forty consecutive subjects (symptomatic, well CRC screening) referred colonoscopy various indications across five centers Germany provided stool samples performing M2-PK immunochemical FOB strip test. IFOBT used rapid immunochromatographic assay detection fecal hemoglobin. M2-PK, commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) used. M2-PK test needs 6 h, office-based test read 10 min five times cheaper. RESULTS: Office-based IFOBT sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive negative likelihood ratios (LR) 64.5, 96.3, 72.0, 94.9, 17.5, 0.4 diagnosing colorectal neoplasia (CRN), performance characteristics M2-PK cutoff value 4 U/mL 72.4, 73.8, 29.0, 94.8, 2.8, 0.8 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: office-based IFOBT found significantly higher specificity, PPV, positive LR compared M2-PK. IFOBT proved convenient, noncumbersome, quick, cheap tool patients above-average risk detection CRN.
