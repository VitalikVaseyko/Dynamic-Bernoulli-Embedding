 Inactivation M2 form pyruvate kinase (PKM2) cancer cells associated increased tumorigenicity. test hypothesis tumor growth may inhibited PKM2 pathway, generated series small-molecule PKM2 activators. compounds exhibited low nanomolar activity biochemical cell-based PKM2 activity assays. compounds affect growth cancer cell lines normal conditions vitro, strongly inhibited proliferation multiple lung cancer cell lines serine absent cell culture media. addition, PKM2 activators inhibited growth aggressive lung adenocarcinoma xenograft. findings show PKM2 activation small molecules influences growth cancer cells vitro vivo, suggest compounds may augment cancer therapies.
