 Human liver slices (surgery biopsies) preincubated glucagon epinephrine 10 min 37 degrees C Krebs-Henseleit solution pH 7.4, absence presence glibenclamide, homogenized assayed phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activity subsaturating, near physiological, substrate concentrations (suitable detecting regulatory effects). Preincubation 10 microM glucagon (n = 7) 10 microM epinephrine (n = 7) resulted reduction PFK activity 25% (P less 0.02) 29% (P less 0.05), respectively. Addition 2 microM glibenclamide preincubation mixture reduced inhibitory effect glucagon 99% (P less 0.05) epinephrine 70% (P less 0.01). Likewise, 10 microM glucagon (n = 6) 10 microM epinephrine (n = 4) reduced PK activity 40% (P less 0.01) 46% (P less 0.01), respectively. Addition 2 microM glibenclamide significantly reduced inhibitory effect glucagon 77% (P less 0.05) epinephrine 33% (P less 0.05). absence hormones, glibenclamide without effect. Thus, glibenclamide opposes inhibitory effect glucagon epinephrine two key hepatic glycolytic enzymes. Since inhibition key glycolytic enzymes favours gluconeogenesis, observed action glibenclamide, occurs also vivo, might reduce glucagon- epinephrine-stimulated gluconeogenesis, could regarded insulin-like action.
