 MiR-375 important small non-coding RNA specifically expressed islet cells pancreas. miR-375 required normal pancreatic genesis influences beta-cell mass also alpha-cell mass. miR-375 also important glucose-regulated insulin secretion regulation expression Mtpn Pdk1 genes. human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiate endodermal lineages, miR-375 highly expressed definitive endoderm, suggests miR-375 may distinct role early development. miR-375 plays important role complex regulatory network pancreatic development, could regulated pancreatic genes, NeuroD1, Ngn3, Pdx1 Hnf6; additionally, miR-375 regulates genes related pancreas development, cell growth proliferation insulin secretion genes exert function. special role miR-375, may potential target treat diabetes. Antagonising miR-375 may enhance effects exendin-4 patients, controlling expression miR-375 could assist mature hESCs-derived beta-cells.
