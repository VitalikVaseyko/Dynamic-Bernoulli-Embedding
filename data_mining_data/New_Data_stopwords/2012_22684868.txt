 consider cancer "metabolic disease"? Tumors result metabolic selection, forming tissues composed heterogeneous cells generally express overactive metabolism common feature. fact, cancer cells increased needs energy biosynthetic intermediates support growth invasiveness. However, high proliferation rate often generates regions insufficiently oxygenated. Therefore, carbohydrate metabolism must rely mostly glycolytic process uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation. metabolic switch, also known Warburg effect, constitutes fundamental adaptation tumor cells relatively hostile environment, supports evolution aggressive metastatic phenotypes. result, tumor glycolysis may constitute attractive target cancer therapy. approach often raised concerns antiglycolytic agents may cause serious side effects toward normal cells. key selective action cancer cells found hyperbolic addiction glycolysis, may exploited generate new anticancer drugs minimal toxicity. growing evidence support many glycolytic enzymes transporters suitable candidate targets cancer therapy. Herein review relevant antiglycolytic agents investigated thus far treatment cancer.
