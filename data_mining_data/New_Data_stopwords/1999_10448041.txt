 Glycolysis occupies central role cellular metabolism, particular importance catabolic production ATP protozoan parasites Leishmania Trypanosoma. organisms pyruvate kinase plays key regulatory role, unique responding fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosteric activator. determination first eukaryotic pyruvate kinase crystal structure T-state reported. comparison leishmania yeast R-state enzymes reveals fewer differences previous comparison Escherichia coli T-state rabbit muscle non-allosteric enzymes. Structural changes related allosteric transition therefore distinguished consequence inherent wide structural divergence bacterial mammalian proteins. allosteric transition involves significant changes tightly packed array eight alpha helices interface near catalytic site. interface allosteric transition appears accompanied bending ten-stranded intersubunit beta sheet adjacent effector site. Helix Calpha1 makes contacts N-terminal helical domain bridges interfaces. comparison effector sites leishmania yeast enzymes reveals structural basis different effector specificity. Two loops comprising residues 443-453 480-489 adopt different conformations two enzymes, Lys453 His480 feature trypanosomatid enzymes provide probable ligands 2-phospho group effector molecule. differences offer opportunity design drugs would bind trypanosomatid enzymes mammalian host.
