 Molecular forms hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) separated fractionating DEAE-cellulose. 120-h food deprivation rats entails progressive decline L-PK activity, activity M-type enzyme minor fraction. rate L-PK degradation depends fasting duration. rapid inactivation phase followed slower one speed constants 0.023 0.0065 h-1, respectively. control L-PK degradation rates fasting diets, protein modification phosphorylation employed.
