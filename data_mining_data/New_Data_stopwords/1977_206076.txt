 1. Starting spectrophotometric method Ballard optimal reaction conditions measurements galactokinase piglet liver systematically studied. (final conc. test): 100 mM triethanolamine-HCl buffer, 33 mM KCl, 16.5 mM NaF (inhibiting ATPase), 5 mM cysteine hydrochloride, 0.33 mM NADH2, 1 U pyruvate kinase lactic dehydrogenase, 0.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 1.5 mM galactose, 0.5 mM ATP 1 mM MgCl2, final pH 7.5. 2. optimal substrate concentration, Mg: ATP-ratio 2:1, pH-stability addition activators important determination galactokinase activity supernatant fraction pig liver. 3. Using optimized method galactokinase activity pig liver dependence age, particular reference perinatal period, determined. 4. Galactokinase activity liver newborn piglets 7 times adult pigs. suckling period activity remains relatively constant high level decreases remarkably immediately weaning. 5. Galactokinase liver newborn piglets differs kinetic properties (lower Km ATP, higher maximal reaction velocity) enzyme adult pigs, still insufficient make sure existence two different forms enzyme.
