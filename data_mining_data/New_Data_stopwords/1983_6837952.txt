 authors demonstrated statistically significant decrease aldolase pyruvate kinase activity erythrocytes group men hypogonadism significant defect gonad endocrinologic function. similar phenomenon appeared erythrocytes group sexually mature rabbits castration. course substitutional treatment testosterone esters given intramuscularly, increase activity characteristic examined glycolytic enzymes observed experimental groups, i.e. patients animals. pyruvate kinase increase, however, statistically significant examined group men, resulted small size group. authors suggest existence testosterone influence regular activity bone marrow glycolytic enzymes, consequently mature erythrocytes. decrease aldolase pyruvate kinase activity erythrocytes patients male hypogonadism may decrease erythrocytes valence. ist another biochemical argument need conducting long-term substitutional therapy cases male hypogonadism.
