 present study investigated effect 1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) liver injury hepatic glucose metabolism db/db mice. Mice divided five groups: normal control, db/db control, DNJ-20 (DNJ 20 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), DNJ-40 (DNJ 40 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) DNJ-80 (DNJ 80 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). doses treated intravenously tail vein four weeks. DNJ observed significantly reduce levels serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) liver TG, well activities serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST); DNJ also alleviated macrovesicular steatosis decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels liver tissue. Furthermore, DNJ treatment significantly increased hepatic glycogen content, activities hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK) liver tissue, decreased activities glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), glycogen phosphorylase (GP), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Moreover, DNJ increased phosphorylation phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) p85, protein kinase B (PKB) Ser473, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) Ser9, inhibited phosphorylation glycogen synthase (GS) Ser645 liver tissue db/db mice. results demonstrate DNJ increase hepatic insulin sensitivity via strengthening insulin-stimulated PKB/GSK-3beta signal pathway modulating glucose metabolic enzymes db/db mice. Moreover, DNJ also improve lipid homeostasis attenuate hepatic steatosis db/db mice.
