 Glycolytic fluxes resting Escherichia coli enhanced overexpression heterologous pyruvate kinases (Pyk) Bacillus stearothermophilus Zymomonas mobilis, homologous Pyk. Compared control, increase 10% specific glucose consumption 15% specific ethanol production rates found anaerobic resting cells, expressing heterologous Pyks, harvested exponentially growing aerobic cultures. increase glycolytic flux achieved simultaneous overexpression E. coli phosphofructokinase (Pfk) Pyk specific glucose consumption ethanol production rates 25% 35% greater, respectively, control. Fluxes lactate significantly affected, contrary previous observations resting cells harvested anaerobically growing cultures. correlate physiology resting cells physiology cells prior harvest, determined relevant growth parameters aerobic anaerobic precultures. conclude glycolytic fluxes E. coli submaximal (aerobic) metabolic activity increased overexpression pyruvate kinases require allosteric activation co-overexpression Pfk. However, improvements require extensive engineering E. coli near maximal (anaerobic) metabolic activity.
