 OBJECTIVE: NONcNZO10 (NZ10) mice predisposed obesity develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) hepatic steatosis even maintained control diet (CD) 6% fat. Studies designed determine whether extreme susceptibility phenotype could alleviated diet molecular targets diet. METHODS: NZ10 SWR/J (SWR) control mice fed CD test diet high protein fish oil (HPO) 19 weeks analyzed steatosis, blood chemistry, hepatic gene micro-RNA expression. RESULTS: HPO diet prevented steatosis, significantly increased serum adiponectin reduced serum cholesterol triglycerides NZ10 mice. HPO diet repressed hepatic expression fatty acid metabolic regulators including PPAR-gamma, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-c1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1, fatty acid synthase, fatty acid binding protein-4, apolipoprotein A4 genes NZ10 mice. Also repressed HPO diet adiponectinR2 receptor, leptin-R, PPAR-alpha, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms 2 4, AKT2 GSK3beta. Micro-RNA (miR) arrays identified miRs diet and/or genetics regulated. QRTPCR confirmed increased expression miR-205 suppression series miRs including miRs-411, 155, 335 21 NZ10-HPO group, implicated progression diabetes and/or steatosis. Evidence presented miR-205 co-regulates PPARgamma may regulate fibrosis EMT progression steatosis livers NZ10-CD mice. dietary responses miR-205 tissue-specific opposite effects adipose liver. CONCLUSION: results confirm HPO diet overrides genetic susceptibility NZ10 mice correlates suppression key genes perhaps micro-RNAs involved hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia inflammation including master PPAR regulators, adiponectin leptin receptors.
