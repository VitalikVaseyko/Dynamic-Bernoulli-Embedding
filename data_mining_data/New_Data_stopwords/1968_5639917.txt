 1. enzymes ultrasonically prepared extracts Chloropseudomonas ethylicum studied elucidate organism assimilates acetate carbon dioxide cannot grow either two compounds alone. 2. extracts (i) convert acetate oxaloacetate alpha-oxoglutarate, (ii) convert oxaloacetate succinyl-CoA, (iii) convert phosphopyruvate 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (iv) interconvert phosphopyruvate pyruvate via oxaloacetate. 3. Pyruvate kinase, alpha-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, ribulose diphosphate carboxylase, isocitrate lyase malate synthase detected. 4. difficult detect aconitate hydratase, fumarate hydratase citrate synthase extracts organism ultrasonically treated tris buffer; demonstrate enzymes extracts prepared phosphate buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. 5. Provided organism synthesize pyruvate acetate carbon dioxide, enzymes detected sufficient account nutritional requirements organism.
