 human pyruvate kinase L/R-gene completely sequenced unrelated normal individuals pyruvate kinase-deficient patients PCR-based direct genomic sequencing approach analyzed polymorphisms. total length gene 8409 nucleotides. Four polymorphic sites detected: C/A1705 C/T1992 exon 12, T-stretch intron 1 occurring two polymorphic forms (T)10 (T)19 (ATT)n microsatellite intron J found variation (ATT)11-17. Haplotype analysis using four markers applied trace genetic background PK-deficiencies. results support idea single origin individual PK-mutations.
