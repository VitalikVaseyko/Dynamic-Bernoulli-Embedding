 characterize location glycolytic enzymes (GEs) intact human erythrocytes, freshly drawn blood fixed stained Abs GAPDH, aldolase, phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), carbonic anhydrase II, Hb, band 3 (AE1). Confocal microscopy revealed cells band 3 displays expected membrane staining Hb evenly distributed across cytoplasm, GEs largely limited membrane. Biochemical studies confirmed membrane binding sites GAPDH, aldolase, PFK reside band 3, related analyses demonstrate sites PK LDH not. Four lines evidence demonstrate GEs least partially assembled multimeric complexes near NH2 terminus band 3. First, mAb residues 1-12 band 3 displaces GEs membrane, including LDH PK, bind band 3. Second, tyrosine phosphorylation NH2 terminus band 3 (Y8 Y21) reversibly releases GEs membrane, including LDH PK. Third, deoxygenation RBCs dislodges GEs membrane, consistent established ability deoxyHb oxyHb bind NH2 terminus band 3. Fourth, large increase accessibility enzyme epitopes observed upon dissociation GEs membrane. conclude, therefore, GEs organized complexes membrane whose assembly regulated oxygenation phosphorylation.
