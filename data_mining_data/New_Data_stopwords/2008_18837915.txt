 3'-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) identified ability phosphorylate activate Akt. Accumulated studies shown activation PDK1/Akt pathway plays pivotal role cell survival, proliferation, tumorigenesis. Therefore, PDK1/Akt pathway believed critical target cancer intervention. paper, report discovery new function phenothiazines, widely known antipsychotics, inhibiting PDK1/Akt pathway. Upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, phenothiazines specifically suppressed kinase activity PDK1 phosphorylation level Akt. inhibition PDK1/Akt kinase resulted suppression EGF-induced cell growth induction apoptosis human ovary cancer cells. particular, phenothiazines highly selective downstream targets PDK1/Akt inhibit activation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), EGFR, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). particular, phenothiazines effectively suppressed tumor growth nude mice human cancer cells. Taken together, findings provide strong evidence novel function phenothiazines, pharmacologically targeting PDK1/Akt anticancer drug discovery.
