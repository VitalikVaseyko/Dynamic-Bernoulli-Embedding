 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency (PKD) autosomal recessive disorder typical manifestation nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. analyzed mutant enzymes 10 unrelated patients PKD, whose symptoms ranged mild, chronic hemolytic anemia severe anemia, sequence analysis presence alterations PKLR gene. cases patients shown compound heterozygous. Eight novel mutations identified: 458T-->C (Ile153Thr), 656T-->C (Ile219Thr), 877G-->A (Asp293Asn), 991G-->A (Asp331Asn), 1055C-->A (Ala352Asp), 1483G-->A (Ala495Thr), 1649A-->T (Asp550Val), 183-184ins16bp. 16 bp duplication produces frameshift subsequent stop codon resulting drastically reduced mRNA level, probably unstable gene product. Surprisingly, existence M2-type PK could demonstrated patient's red blood cells. study different polymorphic sites revealed, one exception, strict linkage 1705C, 1738T, IVS5(+51)T, T(10) polymorphisms presence 14 ATT repeats intron 11. analyses show consequences distorted structure enzyme function discuss correlations mutations identified parameters indicative enzyme function.
