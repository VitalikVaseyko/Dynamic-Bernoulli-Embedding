 BACKGROUND: miRNAs single-stranded, small RNA molecules length 18-25 nucleotides. bind 3' untranslated regions mRNA transcripts reduce translation transcripts cause degradation. roles molecules differ biological processes, cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis tumor genesis. miRNA-33 encoded gene introns proteins bind sterol-regulatory elements. molecule cooperates proteins control cholesterol homeostasis, fatty acid levels genes related expression fat metabolism. examination miR-33 expression target genes promote in-depth study miRNA regulation mechanism formation process goose fatty liver lay foundation research human fatty liver. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: (1) real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan MicroRNA Assay), detected expression miR-33 feeding Landes geese. expression level miR-33 increases significantly liver 19 days comparison control group; (2) using bioinformatics software programs TargetScan, miRDB miRCosm predict target genes miR-33 according laboratory prophase transcriptome results references, screen nine target genes: adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters A1, adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters G1, Neimann Pick C, carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CROT), cyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase, beta subunit (HADHB), AMP-activated protein kinase, alpha subunit 1 (AMPKalpha1), insulin receptor substrate 2, glutamic pyruvate transaminase adipose differentiation-related protein. dual luciferase reporter gene system CHO cell line verifies CROT, HADHB NPC1 target genes miR-33 geese. inhibition rate CROT highest reaches 70%; (3) seed sequence (5' 2-8 bases) acting site miR-33. two predicted target sites CROT target sites miR-33. Moreover, predicted target site HADHB NPC1 target site miR-33. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: (1) 19 days overfeeding, expression level miR-33 increases significantly livers geese; (2) CROT, HADHB NPC1 target genes miR-33 geese. genes determine combined target site.
