 Doberman pinscher (DP) canine breed displays high incidence idiopathic, nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) increased mortality. common mutation DPs splice site deletion pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene shows positive correlation DCM development. PDK4, vital mitochondrial protein, controls switch glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation based upon nutrient availability. likely, although unproven, DPs PDK4 mutation unable switch oxidative phosphorylation periods low nutrient availability, thus highly susceptible mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. study investigated cell viability, mitochondrial stress, activation intrinsic (mitochondrial mediated) apoptotic pathway dermal fibroblasts DPs healthy (PDK4(wt/wt)), heterozygous (PDK4(wt/del)), homozygous (PDK4(del/del)) PDK4 mutation conditions high (unstarved) low (starved) nutrient availability vitro. hypothesized, PDK4(wt/del) PDK4(del/del) cells showed evidence mitochondrial stress activation intrinsic apoptotic pathway following starvation, PDK4(wt/wt) cells remained healthy viable conditions. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) PDK4-mediated gene replacement experiments confirmed cause-effect relationships PDK4 deficiency apoptosis activation. restoration function observed following administration AAV-PDK4 provides strong support translation gene therapy approach clinical realm PDK4-affected Dobermans.
