 Ghosts human erythrocytes prepared hypotonic hemolysis assayed aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase reductase. Cryptic activity enzymes demonstrated increase activity dilution water, caused fragmentation ghosts. Aldolase glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase classed firmly bound; phosphoglycerate kinase intermediate; others loosely bound. Triton X-100 increased activities aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase. pH medium little effect upon firmly bound enzymes markedly affected retention hemoglobin activities loosely bound enzymes. presence Mg Ca ions enhanced retention hemoglobin activity lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, little effect aldolase glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase. Ghosts diluted water disintegrated fragments tubules vesicles; Mg Ca 1MM afforded protection this. ghosts treated Triton X-100 adenosine triphosphate, contracted one-seventh volume. shrunken ghosts lost considerable proportion cholesterol protein medium.
