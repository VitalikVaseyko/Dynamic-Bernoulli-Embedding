 Weanling male Sprague Dawley rats fed vitamin E C-free basal diet without supplementation 100 IU vitamin E per kg diet. 20 weeks, vitamin E-deficient rats divided four groups, six group, received supplemental ascorbic acid and/or vitamin E tube feeding daily 7 days: Group I, 30 mg ascorbic acid/100 g body wt.; Group II, 0.03 mg RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate/100 g body wt.; Group III, 30 mg ascorbic acid 0.03 mg RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate/100 g body wt.; Group IV, placebo. six control rats (Group V) received placebo. rats sacrificed, blood liver samples collected biochemical determinations. Vitamin E deficiency significantly increased erythrocyte (RBC) spontaneous hemolysis, liver thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, activities glutamateoxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), pyruvate kinase (PK), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) plasma, significantly lowered plasma vitamin E levels glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities. Tube-feeding ascorbic acid 7 days produced partial reversal effect liver TBA values, activities plasma PK, GOT, CPK, plasma vitamin E levels RBC hemolysis plasma GPX activity. Tube feeding ascorbic acid vitamin E showed similar partial reversal effect feeding vitamin E alone parameters stated above. results suggest ascorbic acid may spare metabolism vitamin E partially reverse changes biochemical parameters characteristic vitamin E deficiency.
