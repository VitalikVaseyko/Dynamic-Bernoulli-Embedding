 last decade witnessed renaissance Otto Warburg's fundamental hypothesis, put forward 80 years ago, mitochondrial malfunction subsequent stimulation cellular glucose utilization lead development cancer. Since tumor cells demonstrate remarkable resistance drugs kill non-malignant cells, question arisen whether resistance might consequence abnormalities tumor mitochondria predicted Warburg. present review discusses potential mechanisms underlying upregulation glycolysis silencing mitochondrial activity cancer cells, pharmaceutical intervention cellular energy metabolism might make tumor cells susceptible anti-cancer treatment.
