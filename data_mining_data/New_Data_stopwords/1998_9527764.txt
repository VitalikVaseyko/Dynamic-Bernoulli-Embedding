 coupled chromogenic reaction (based agar overlay combining NADH, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, kanamycin sulfate thiazolyl blue-phenazine methosulfate detection NADH consumption) optimized detection aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs). used analytical isoelectrofocusing bacterial extracts APH-producing strains, method revealed one band two strains genetically confirmed APH (3') two bands another strain APH (3') APH (3') VI, whereas bands detected susceptible control strains aminoglycoside-resistant microorganisms without APH genes.
