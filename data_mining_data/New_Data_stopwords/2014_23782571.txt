 AIMS: investigate mechanism metabolic disturbance induced atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, examined whether adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) hypothalamus hepatic glucose production involved effect olanzapine. METHODS: Male 6-week-old ICR mice used. Blood glucose levels determined glucose oxidase method. mRNA levels gluconeogenic glycolytic enzymes measured reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). AMPK expression measured Western blotting. RESULTS: Systemic injection olanzapine increased blood glucose levels unfasted fasted mice. However, increase fasted mice less unfasted mice. Central administration olanzapine also increased blood glucose levels unfasted mice, fasted mice. pyruvate tolerance test, olanzapine significantly increased blood glucose levels. addition, olanzapine increased mRNA levels glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), gluconeogenic enzyme, liver. Furthermore, olanzapine increased phosphorylated AMPK hypothalamus unfasted mice, olanzapine-induced hyperglycaemia inhibited AMPK inhibitor compound C. Central administration AMPK activator AICAR significantly increased G6Pase mRNA levels liver blood glucose levels. Moreover, olanzapine- AICAR-induced hyperglycaemia attenuated beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, suggesting olanzapine AICAR induce hepatic glucose production sympathetic nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: results indicate olanzapine activates AMPK hypothalamus, increases hepatic glucose production via sympathetic nervous system.
