 Renal medullary cells contain large quantities organic osmolytes levels salt urea renal medullary interstitial fluid high. Two osmolytes, betaine glycerophosphocholine (GPC), methylamines. Methylamines generally counteract perturbing effects urea enzymes macromolecules. Betaine previously shown counteract effect urea enzymes vitro protect renal cells tissue culture harmful effects high urea. Nevertheless, renal medullary cells vivo tissue culture specifically accumulate GPC rather betaine, response high urea. present studies tested directly whether GPC counteracts effect urea Km pyruvate kinase (PK) ADP compared effectiveness regard GPC betaine. find urea increases Km (as previously observed), betaine GPC decrease it, increase caused urea counteracted betaine GPC. effects GPC slightly less betaine. addition, renal medullary organic osmolytes (namely sorbitol, inositol taurine) already known compatible osmolytes whose accumulation protects renal medullary cells hypertonicity little effect enzyme function. agreement generalization find high sorbitol inositol little effect PK activity, surprisingly taurine reduces Vmax greatly elevates Km. conclusion, main finding direct evidence GPC counteracting osmolyte, explains accumulation response high urea. However, find GPC effective counteracting osmolyte betaine, leaves unexplained preference renal cells GPC betaine counteracting perturbing effect urea.
