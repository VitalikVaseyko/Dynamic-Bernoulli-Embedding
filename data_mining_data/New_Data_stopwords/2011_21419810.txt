 focus research investigate role protein kinase C-iota (PKC-iota) regulation Bad, pro-apoptotic BH3-only molecule Bcl-2 family glioblastoma. Robust expression PKC-iota hallmark human glioma benign malignant meningiomas. results obtained two human glial tumor derived cell lines, T98G U87MG. cells, PKC-iota co-localized directly associated Bad, shown immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting. Furthermore, in-vitro kinase activity assay showed PKC-iota directly phosphorylated Bad phospho specific residues, Ser-112, Ser-136 Ser-155 turn induced inactivation Bad disruption Bad/Bcl-XL dimer. Knockdown PKC-iota siRNA exhibited corresponding reduction Bad phosphorylation suggesting PKC-iota may Bad kinase. PKC-iota knockdown also induced apoptosis cell lines. Since, PKC-iota essential downstream mediator PI (3)-kinase, hypothesize glioma cell survival mediated via PI (3)-kinase/PDK1/PKC-iota/Bad pathway. Treatment PI (3)-kinase inhibitors Wortmannin LY294002, well PDK1 siRNA, inhibited PKC-iota activity subsequent phosphorylation Bad suggesting PKC-iota regulates activity Bad PI (3)-kinase dependent manner. Thus, data suggest glioma cell survival occurs novel PI (3)-kinase/PDK1/PKC-iota/BAD mediated pathway.
