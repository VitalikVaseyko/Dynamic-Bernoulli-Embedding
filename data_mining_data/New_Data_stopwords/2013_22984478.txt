 Previous animal clinical studies shown acupuncture effective alternative treatment management hypertension, mechanism unclear. study investigated proteomic response nervous system treatment Taichong (LR3) acupoint spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Unanesthetized rats subject 5-min daily acupuncture treatment 7 days. Blood pressure monitored 7 days. euthanasia 7(th) day, rat medullas dissected, homogenized, subject 2D gel electrophoresis MALDI-TOF analysis. results indicate blood pressure stabilized 5th day acupuncture, compared non-acupoint treatment, Taichong-acupunctured rat's systolic pressure reduced significantly (P<0.01), though enough bring blood pressure normal levels. different treatment groups also showed differential protein expression: 2D images revealed 571 +/- 15 proteins normal SD rats' medulla, 576 +/- 31 proteins SHR's medulla, 597 +/- 44 proteins medulla SHR acupuncturing Taichong, 616 +/- 18 proteins medulla SHR acupuncturing non-acupoint. medulla Taichong group, compared non-acupoint group, seven proteins down-regulated: heat shock protein-90, synapsin-1, pyruvate kinase isozyme, NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-2, protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1, ubiquitin hydrolase isozyme L1, myelin basic protein. Six proteins up-regulated: glutamate dehydrogenase 1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, glutathione S-transferase M5, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 1, DJ-1 protein superoxide dismutase. altered expression several proteins acupuncture confirmed ELISA, Western blot qRT-PCR assays. results indicate increase antioxidant enzymes medulla SHRs subject acupuncture, may provide partial explanation antihypertensive effect acupuncture. studies warranted investigate role oxidative stress modulation acupuncture treatment hypertension.
