 Corynebacterium glutamicum shows great potential production glutamate-derived diamine putrescine, monomeric compound polyamides. genome-scale stoichiometric model C. glutamicum strain reduced ornithine transcarbamoylase activity, derepressed arginine biosynthesis, anabolic plasmid-addiction system heterologous expression E. coli ornithine decarboxylase gene speC investigated flux balance analysis respect putrescine production potential. Based simulations, enhancing glycolysis anaplerosis plasmid-borne overexpression genes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate carboxylase well reducing 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity chosen targets metabolic engineering. Changing translational start codon chromosomal gene 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase subunit E1o less preferred TTG changing threonine 15 OdhI alanine reduced 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity five fold improved putrescine titers 28%. Additional engineering steps improved putrescine production largest contributions preventing formation by-product N-acetylputrescine deletion spermi(di)ne N-acetyltransferase gene snaA overexpression gene feedback-resistant N-acetylglutamate kinase variant. resulting C. glutamicum strain NA6 obtained systems metabolic engineering accumulated two fold putrescine base strain, i.e., 58.1 +/- 0.2 mM, showed specific productivity 0.045 g.g-1.h-1 yield glucose 0.26 g.g-1.
