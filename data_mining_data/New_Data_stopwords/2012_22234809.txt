 Oncogenic viruses represent significant public health burden light multitude malignancies result chronic spontaneous viral infection transformation. Although many molecular signaling pathways underlie virus-mediated cellular transformation known, impact viruses metabolic signaling phenotype within proliferating tumor cells less well understood. Whether interaction oncogenic viruses metabolic signaling pathways involves enhanced glucose uptake glycolysis (both hallmark features transformed cells) dysregulation molecular pathways regulate oxidative stress, viruses adept facilitating tumor expansion. effects cell proliferation pathways, PI3K MAPK pathways, cell cycle regulatory proteins p53 ATM, cell stress response proteins HIF-1alpha AMPK, viruses exert control critical metabolic signaling cascades. Additionally, oncogenic viruses modulate tumor metabolomic profile direct indirect interactions glucose transporters, GLUT1, specific glycolytic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase. pathways, oncogenic viruses alter phenotypic characteristics energy-use methods transformed cells; therefore, may possible develop novel antiglycolytic therapies target dysregulated pathways virus-derived malignancies.
