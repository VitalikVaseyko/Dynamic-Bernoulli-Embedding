 Microalgal neutral lipids [mainly form triacylglycerols (TAGs)], feasible substrates biofuel, typically accumulated stationary growth phase. make microalgal biofuels economically competitive fossil fuels, generating strains trigger TAG accumulation exponential growth phase promising biological approach. regulatory mechanisms trigger TAG accumulation exponential growth phase (TAEP) important uncovered advancing economic feasibility. inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase sodium dichloroacetate, acetyl-CoA level increased, resulting TAEP microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta. reported refilling acetyl-CoA pool branched-chain amino acid catabolism contributed overall sixfold TAEP marginal compromise (4%) growth TAG-rich D. tertiolecta mutant targeted screening. Herein, three-step alpha loop-integrated metabolic model introduced shed lights neutral lipid regulatory mechanism. article provides novel approaches compress lipid production phase heightens lipid productivity photosynthetic carbon capture via enhancing acetyl-CoA level, would optimize renewable microalgal biofuel fulfil demanding fuel market.
