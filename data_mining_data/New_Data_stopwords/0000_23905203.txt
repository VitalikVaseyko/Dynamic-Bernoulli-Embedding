 Cancer cells altered metabolic processes compared normal differentiated cells expression M2 isozyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2) plays important role aberrant metabolism. M1 isoform highly active enzyme typically expressed muscle brain tissue, alternatively spliced M2 variant considerably less active expressed many tumors studied date. report describes use PKM2 activator, ML265, details biophysical, ex vivo vivo activity compound. ML265 induces active tetrameric state PKM2 X-ray co-crystal structure shows activator binds dimer-dimer interface two subunits PKM2. compound tested H1299 mouse xenograft model showed significant reduction tumor size, weight, occurrence apparent toxicity 7-week experiment.
