 Based measurements theoretical analyses, identified deletion pyruvate kinase (PYK) activity possible route elimination acid formation Bacillus subtilis cultures grown glucose minimal media. Evidence consistent attenuation PYK flux come metabolic flux calculations, metabolic pool enzymatic activity measurements, series nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, suggesting nearly complete inhibition PYK activity glucose-citrate fed cultures amount acid formation nearly zero. paper, report construction characterization pyk mutant B. subtilis. results demonstrate almost complete elimination acid production cultures pyk mutant glucose minimal medium. substantial reduction acid production accompanied increased CO(2) production reduced rate growth. Metabolic analysis indicated dramatic increase intracellular pools phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) glucose-6-P pyk mutant. high concentrations PEP glucose-6-P could explain decreased growth rate mutant. substantial accumulation PEP occur Escherichia coli pyk mutants. high concentration PEP accumulates B. subtilis pyk mutant could exploited production various aromatics.
