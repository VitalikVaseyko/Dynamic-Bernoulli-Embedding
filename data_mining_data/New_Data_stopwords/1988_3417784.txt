 carboxy-terminal tail nucleoplasmin, specifies entry cell nucleus, contains four short sequences similar previously identified nuclear location sequences. show none able locate chicken muscle pyruvate kinase cell nucleus. Deletion analysis used determine limits nuclear location sequence indicated 14-amino acid segment (RPAATKKAGQAKKK) function minimal nuclear location sequence. tested directly, however, sequence unable locate pyruvate kinase cell nucleus. Restoration three amino acids nucleoplasmin sequence either end sequence generated sequences able locate pyruvate kinase cell nucleus. 14-amino acid proposed minimal nuclear location sequence present functional sequences, AVKRPAATKKAGQAKKK, RPAATKKAGQAKKKKLD, sequence AVKRPAATKKAGQAKKKKLD, additional amino acids ends. minimal sequence element therefore necessary sufficient transport cell nucleus. unusual feature nucleoplasmin nuclear location sequence suggests ways could interact nuclear transport mechanism.
