 Many cancer cells display Warburg effect, is, enhanced glycolysis followed fermentation (conversion pyruvate lactate). Recently, molecular basis effects started elucidated, up-regulation lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) isoform lactate dehydrogenase felt major molecular mediator phenomenon. Moreover, LDH-A expression tumor tissue LDH-A levels blood portend bad prognosis, LDH-A blockade lead tumor growth inhibition tumor transplant models. extended existing data (some published time carrying studies) two important ways: 1) inhibition LDH-A glycolytic lung cancer cell line results reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis increased sensitivity chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel 2) inhibition fermentative glycolysis also accomplished activation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex drug dichloroacetate, undergoing clinical trials, phenomenon monitored vivo noninvasive real-time manner magnetic resonance spectroscopy using hyperpolarized pyruvate. Collectively, data suggest vivo effects drugs redirect fate pyruvate, hence aimed reversing Warburg effect, could monitored use hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy, method scalable human use.
