 glycolytic capacity rat kidney studied conditions stimulated gluconeogenesis like 48 h starvation 48 h acidosis induced force-feeding NH4Cl/glucose solution. Rats fed ad libitum force-fed glucose solution served controls. specific activities key enzymes phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase determined single segments nephron. determinations performed microdissection lyophilized tissue sections followed enzymatic analysis, including oil well technique, enzymatic amplification, fluorometric measurement. distal portion nephron fed force-fed animals 10-fold higher specific activity phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase found compared proximal portion, known site renal gluconeogenesis. Starvation acidosis altered neither distribution pattern specific activities enzymes. results concluded renal glycolysis undergo alterations level enzymatic activities favour renal gluconeogenesis, probably separate localization pathways within nephron.
