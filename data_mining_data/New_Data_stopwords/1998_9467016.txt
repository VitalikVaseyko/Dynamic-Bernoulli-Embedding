 mouse X-linked mutants lined stripey associated lethality affected males utero striping coat carrier females. demonstrate underlying mutations nested deletions lie Phex-Amelx chromosomal segment conserved man mouse. lined deletion contains less approximately 0.7 cM genetic material includes growth factor-regulated protein kinase gene, Rsk2. Stripey carries larger deletion removes approximately 2.0 cM genetic material, including Rsk2 pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha subunit gene, Pdha1 . Since Coffin-Lowry syndrome neonatal lactic acidosis associated mutations human homologues Rsk2 Pdha1 respectively, lined stripey provide models gene deficiencies disorders.
