Based mitochondrial dysfunction observed fibroblasts brain samples carriers, well neurons brains mouse model premutation, evaluated presence Warburg effect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 30 premutation carriers either rebalance metabolism [increasing glycolysis decreasing oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos)] metabolic amplification (increasing glycolysis maintaining/increasing oxphos). Deficits oxphos-more pronounced FXTAS-affected subjects-were accompanied shift toward glycolysis, suggesting increased glycolysis despite aerobic conditions. Differential proteomics extended findings, unveiling decreased antioxidant response, translation, disrupted extracellular matrix cytoskeleton organization activation prosenescence pathways. Lower bioenergetics segregated increased incidence low executive function, tremors, below-average IQ, FXTAS. combination functional proteomic data unveiled new mechanisms related energy production premutation, showing potential applicable psychiatric disorders identify endophenotype-specific responses relevant neurobiology.-Napoli, E., Song, G., Schneider, A., Hagerman, R., Eldeeb, M.
