 understand regulation thyroid hormone, 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), synthesis cytosolic thyroid hormone binding protein (p58-M2) liver regeneration, synthesis p58-M2 evaluated. synthesis p58-M2 measured metabolic labeling primary cultures derived regenerating liver euthyroid, hypo- hyperthyroid rats. regeneration, increase liver/body weight ratio approximately 25% higher hyper- hypothyroid rats. However, T3 effect rate overall liver regeneration observed four days. mature liver, T3 increased synthesis p58-M2 approximately 2.5-fold. regeneration, however, change synthesis p58-M2 varied thyroid status. euthyroid rats, synthesis p58-M2 continued increase 2-fold liver regeneration. hyperthyroid rats, initial increase 1.5-fold day 1, synthesis p58-M2 subsequently declined regeneration. hypothyroid rats, synthesis p58-M2 remained virtually unchanged regeneration. results indicate T3 regulates synthesis p58-M2 mature regenerating liver.
