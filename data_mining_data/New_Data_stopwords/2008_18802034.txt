 multifaceted approach presented general strategy identify new drug targets breast cancer stem cell-containing side population. approach utilized combines side population cell sorting stable isotope labeling amino acids cell culture mass spectrometry compare identify proteins differential expression profiles side population cells, know enriched cancer stem cells, nonside population cells, depleted cancer stem cells, two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 MDA-MB231. Almost 900 proteins quantified, several important proteins cell cycle control differentiation found upregulated cancer stem cell-containing side population. interestingly, splice isoform pyruvate kinase M2 well peroxiredoxin 6 found downregulated. differential levels three proteins, thymosin beta4 (TB4), proliferation-associated protein 2G4, SIAH-interacting protein, validated using Western blot. Furthermore, functional validation provided clear evidence elevated TB4 expression contributes drug resistance stem cell population. Small interfering RNA silencing TB4 led loss chemoresistance two separate breast cancer populations. proteins likely contribute resistance cancer stem cell-containing side population, altered expression tumor causes clinical resistance chemotherapy. ability perform quantitative mass spectrometry enabled identification series proteins could serve future therapeutic targets.
