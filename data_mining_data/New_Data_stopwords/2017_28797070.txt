 Warburg Effect, characterized increased rate glycolysis even normoxic conditions, one hallmarks cancer. Relatively lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) also characteristic feature cancer cells. hypothesized interference phenomenon, introducing exogenous pyruvate, would upset cancer phenotype boost energy requirements normal cells. find methyl pyruvate protects irinotecan-treated normal lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) probably turning p53/p21 axis apoptotic pathways. MRC-5 fibroblasts recover drug-free medium, intrinsic apoptotic pathway also turned cells survive discernible exponential growth observation period. contrast, mere introduction exogenous pyruvate kills lung cancer cell line (A549). Although, functional p53 important drug-induced cancer cell death, probably essential cancer cell lines mutated p53 also die albeit less efficiently. conclude methyl pyruvate may preferentially kill cancer cells protect normal cells chemotherapy.
