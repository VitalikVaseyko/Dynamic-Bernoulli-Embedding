 S6K1 member AGC subfamily serine-threonine protein kinases, whereby catalytic activation requires dual phosphorylation critical residues conserved T-loop (T229) hydrophobic motif (HM; T389) peptide regions catalytic kinase domain (residues 1-398). addition kinase domain, S6K1 contains C-terminal autoinhibitory domain (AID; residues 399-502), prevents T-loop HM phosphorylation; autoinhibition relieved multi-site Ser-Thr phosphorylation AID (S411, S418, T421, S424). Interestingly, 66 104 C-terminal AID amino acid residues computer predicted exist structurally disordered peptide regions, begetting interest dynamics could coupled autoregulation. begin addressing issue, developed optimized protocols efficient AID expression purification. Consistent computer predictions, aberrant mobilities SDS-PAGE size-exclusion chromatography, well low chemical shift dispersion (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR spectra, indicated purified recombinant AID largely unfolded. Yet, trans-addition purified AID effectively inhibited PDK1-catalyzed T-loop phosphorylation catalytic kinase domain construct S6K1. Using identical purification protocol, similar protein yields tetraphospho-mimic mutant AID(D(2)ED) construct obtained; construct displayed weak inhibition PDK1-catalyzed T229 phosphorylation. Purification structurally 'disordered' functional C-terminal AID AID(D(2)ED) constructs facilitate studies aimed understand role conformational plasticity protein phosphorylation modulating autoregulatory domain-domain interactions.
