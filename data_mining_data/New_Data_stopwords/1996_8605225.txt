 Expression key regulatory enzymes involved glucose metabolism studied livers Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats, model non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. activity mRNA levels glucokinase L-type pyruvate kinase increased liver OLETF rats compared control rats. remarkable change liver-type phosphofructokinase. activities glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6-biphosphatase also increase despite high plasma levels glucose insulin. activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase show significant change. mRNA levels fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase exhibited marked changes. results suggest expression glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6-biphosphatase disordered OLETF rats.
