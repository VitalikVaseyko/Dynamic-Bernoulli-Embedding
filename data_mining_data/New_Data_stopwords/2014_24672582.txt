 Effective delivery holds key successful vivo application therapeutic small interfering RNA (siRNA). work, developed universal siRNA carrier consisting mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNP) functionalized cyclodextrin-grafted polyethylenimine (CP). CP provides positive charge loading siRNA electrostatic interaction enables effective endosomal escape siRNA. Using intravital microscopy able monitor tumor enrichment CP-MSNP/siRNA particles live mice bearing orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors. CP-MSNP delivery siRNA targeting M2 isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2) resulted effective knockdown gene expression vitro vivo. Suppression PKM2 led inhibition tumor cell growth, invasion, migration.
