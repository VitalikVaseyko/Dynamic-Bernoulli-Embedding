 Leishmania major promastigotes grown late log phase, washed resuspended Hanks' balanced salt solution, incubated glucose various pO2s presence 5% CO2. Samples taken times 0-40 min assayed fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru(2,6)P2), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), phospho(enol)pyruvate (PEP), ATP. 95% O2 ATP remained constant throughout incubation. decrease significantly 10% O2, decreased 20% 30% 6% 0% O2, respectively. 95% O2, Fru(2,6)P2 increased 15-fold within 5 min addition glucose remained high level. 10%, 6%, 0% O2 Fru(2,6)P2 rose 5-fold within 5 min declined slightly remainder incubation. G6P increased 0.5 12 nmol (mg protein)-1 5 min cells incubated 95% O2 declined 5 nmol (mg protein)-1. increased 8 nmol (mg protein)-1 5 min declined slightly cells incubated 10% O2. F6P levels approximately one-eighth G6P levels conditions, suggesting phosphohexoseisomerase subject regulation. PEP levels initially high, 95% O2 50% drop PEP 5 min, 10%, 6%, 0% O2 less decline. observation rise Fru(2,6)P2 levels 10%, 6%, 0% O2 5 min less rise 95% O2 supports presence low affinity oxygen sensor. different time course changes G6P, F6P, PEP levels suggests addition activation pyruvate kinase Fru(2,6)P2, regulatory events also operative low pO2.
