 Silibinin, biologically active component polyphenolic extract milk thistle seeds, widely used prevent many types hepatobiliary disorders. Recent evidence suggests new applications ancient medication, notably treatment type 2 diabetes owing antihyperglycemic properties. lately demonstrated silibinin lowered glucose production various gluconeogenic substrates perifused rat hepatocytes, aim study examine effect silibinin oxidative glucose utilization reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation since release ROS secondary increased mitochondrial metabolism may contribute diabetic damage. found silibinin dose-dependently reduced glycolysis carbohydrates cell perifusion system via inhibitory effect targeted pyruvate kinase activity. Furthermore, dramatic effect upon oxidative phosphorylation shown, evidenced fall ATP-to-ADP ratio, together increase lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. attractive finding silibinin, concentration low 10 microM, fully mitigated rise metabolic flow-driven ROS formation. addition, studies isolated liver mitochondria revealed low dose silibinin depressed ROS production linked electron transfer chain activity. results, one may tentatively suggest interesting activities silibinin, beyond general antioxidant status, could expected potential clinical use, especially pathological conditions mitochondrial ROS formation severely enhanced.
