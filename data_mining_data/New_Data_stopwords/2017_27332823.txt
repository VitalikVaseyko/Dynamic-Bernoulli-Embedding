 BACKGROUND: Treatment restore sinus rhythm among patients atrial fibrillation (AF) limited long-term success rates. Gene expression profiling may provide new insights AF pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: identify biomarkers improve understanding AF pathophysiology comparing whole blood gene expression electrical cardioversion (ECV). METHODS: 46 patients persistent AF underwent ECV, whole blood samples collected 1-2 hours 4 6 weeks successful cardioversion. paired samples sent microarray plasma biomarker comparison. RESULTS: 13,942 genes tested, expression SLC25A20 PDK4 strongest associations AF. Post-cardioversion, SLC25A20 PDK4 expression decreased 0.8 (CI 0.7-0.8, p = 2.0x10-6) 0.7 (CI 0.6-0.8, p = 3.0x10-5) fold respectively. Median N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations decreased 127.7 pg/mL 44.9 pg/mL (p = 2.3x10-13) cardioversion. AF discrimination models combining NT-proBNP gene expression (NT-proBNP + SLC25A20 area curve = 0.88, NT-proBNP + PDK4 AUC = 0.86) greater discriminative capacity compared NT-proBNP alone (AUC = 0.82). Moreover, model including NT-proBNP, SLC25A20 PDK4 significantly improved AF discrimination compared models (AUC = 0.87, Net Reclassification Index >0.56, p<5.8x10-3). validated association SLC25A20 PDK4 AF independent sample 17 patients. CONCLUSION: study demonstrates SLC25A20, PDK4, NT-proBNP incremental utility biomarkers discriminating AF sinus rhythm. Elevated SLC25A20 PDK4 expression AF indicates important role energy metabolism AF.
