 Background: Inhibition Hsp90 shown improve glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity mouse models diabetes. present report, specific isoform Hsp90ab1, identified playing major role regulating insulin signaling glucose metabolism. Methods: diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model diabetes, expression various Hsp90 isoforms skeletal tissue examined. Subsequent experiments characterized role Hsp90ab1 isoform glucose metabolism insulin signaling primary human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM) DIO mouse model. Results: DIO mice Hsp90ab1 mRNA upregulated skeletal muscle compared lean mice knockdown using anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) resulted reduced expression skeletal muscle associated improved glucose tolerance, reduced fed glucose fed insulin levels compared DIO mice treated negative control oligonucleotide. addition, knockdown HSP90ab1 DIO mice associated reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 mRNA phosphorylation muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (at serine 232, 293 300), increased phosphofructokinase 1, glycogen synthase 1 long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase mRNA. HSMM, siRNA knockdown Hsp90ab1 induced increase substrate metabolism, mitochondrial respiration capacity, insulin sensitivity, providing evidence role Hsp90ab1 metabolism. Conclusions: data support novel role Hsp90ab1 arbitrating skeletal muscle plasticity via modulation substrate utilization including glucose fatty acids normal disease conditions. Hsp90ab1 represents novel target potential treatment metabolic disease including diabetes.
