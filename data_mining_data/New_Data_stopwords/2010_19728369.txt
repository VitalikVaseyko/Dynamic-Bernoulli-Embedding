 Oocyte developmental competence progressively obtained pubertal development females. Poor developmental potential oocytes derived prepubertal females suggests essential processes required oocyte development fulfilled. objective experiment analyze protein profiles porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) derived cyclic prepubertal females identify alterations protein abundance correlate developmental potential. COC complexes, aspirated prepubertal cyclic ovaries, pooled three replicates 400 COCs per treatment approximately 100 microl SOF-HEPES medium. Protein samples extracted analyzed two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). 1,600 proteins resolved three replicate gels. Sixteen protein spots identified mass spectrometry, representing 14 unique, differentially expressed proteins (volume ratio greater 1.3). Glutathione-S-transferase pyruvate kinase 3 abundant COCs derived cyclic females, whereas soluble epoxide hydrolase transferrin abundant prepubertal derived COCs. Abundance several glycolytic enzymes (enolase 1, pyruvate kinase 3, phosphoglycerate kinase) increased COCs derived cyclic females, suggesting glucose metabolism decreased prepubertal derived COCs. conclude abundance proteins involved metabolism oxidative stress regulation significantly altered prepubertal derived COCs may play role mechanisms resulting developmental competence.
