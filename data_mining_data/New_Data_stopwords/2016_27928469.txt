 Positron emission tomography (PET) (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) diagnostic tool evaluate metabolic activity measuring accumulation FDG, analogue glucose, widely used detecting small tumors, monitoring treatment response predicting patients' prognosis variety cancers. However, molecular mechanism FDG accumulation tumors remains investigated. well-known cancers metabolically active elevated glucose metabolism, phenomenon known Warburg effect. underlying mechanisms elevated glucose metabolism cancer tissues complex. Recent reports indicated potential FDG-PET/CT scans predicting mutational status (e.g., KRAS gene mutation) colorectal cancer (CRC), suggests FDG-PET/CT scans may play key role determining therapeutic strategies non-invasively predicting treatment response anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy. review, summarize current findings investigating molecular mechanism (18)F-FDG accumulation CRC.
