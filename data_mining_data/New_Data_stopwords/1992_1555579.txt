 Different anaerobic bacteria oxidize variety aromatic compounds completely CO2 via one common aromatic intermediate, benzoyl-CoA. postulated anaerobically aromatic nucleus benzoyl-CoA becomes reduced. oxygen-sensitive enzyme system described catalyzing reduction benzoyl-CoA trans-2-hydroxycyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA denitrifying Pseudomonas species grown anaerobically benzoate plus nitrate. assay mixture consists cell extract, [U-14C]benzoyl-CoA, [U-14C]benzoyl-CoA-generating system (consisting [U-14C]benzoate, purified benzoate-CoA ligase, Mg(2+)-ATP, coenzyme A), ATP-regenerating system (consisting phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, myokinase), low-potential reductant [titanium(III) citrate]. optimal pH 7, specific activity 10 nmol benzoyl-CoA reduced min-1 x mg-1 protein. apparent Km benzoyl-CoA 50 microM. Five major products found. One product cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA must formed benzoyl-CoA reductase. product probably trans-2-hydroxycyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA rather cis-stereoisomer; product must formed cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA hydratase. Two products likely intermediates benzoyl-CoA reduction cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA, suggesting reduction reaction complex. early formed fifth product polar cyclohexanecarboxyl- cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA. enzyme system oxygen control since found cells grown aerobically benzoate. induced aromatic compounds since activity low cells grown anaerobically acetate. actual inducer probably benzoyl-CoA rather benzoate. conclusion drawn fact system also present cells grown anaerobically phenol, phenylacetate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, 2-aminobenzoate; anaerobic metabolism compounds shown organism proceed directly via benzoyl-CoA rather via free benzoate.
