 present study compares time courses early changes parvalbumin content, properties sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) activity isozyme patterns metabolic enzymes chronically (12 h/day) stimulated fast twitch tibialis anterior (TA) muscle rabbit. chosen conditions stimulation, first significant changes appeared 6 days. Except delayed reduction pyruvate kinase, time course changes same. 14 days stimulation, parvalbumin decreased 37% Ca2+-ATPase activity SR 29% normal values. transformation SR also reflected 64% decrease 115000-Mr Ca2+-pumping peptide 5-fold increase 30000-Mr peptide. Following identical time course, mitochondrial activities citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase ketoacid-CoA transferase increased 2.9, 3.0 3.7-fold respectively. similar time course observed H-type transition lactate dehydrogenase isozymes. cause changes discussed relates altered transcriptional and/or translational activities. suggested increase free intracellular Ca2+ caused increased contractile activity, perpetuated decrease Ca2+-binding sequestering capacities, might signal altered synthetic activities.
