 Cancer cells reprogram metabolism meet increased biosynthetic demands, commensurate elevated rates replication. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) catalyzes final rate-limiting step tumor glycolysis, controlling balance energy production synthesis metabolic precursors. report synthesis evaluation positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, [(11)C]DASA-23, provides direct noninvasive measure PKM2 expression preclinical models glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). vivo, orthotopic U87 GBM39 patient-derived tumors clearly delineated surrounding normal brain tissue PET imaging, corresponding exclusive tumor-associated PKM2 expression. addition, systemic treatment mice PKM2 activator TEPP-46 resulted complete abrogation PET signal intracranial GBM39 tumors. Together, data provide basis clinical evaluation imaging agents target important gatekeeper tumor glycolysis.
