 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) common form cancer prevalence worldwide. many factors lead development progression HCC. study aimed identify potential new tumor suppressors, examine function cell cycle modulators, investigate impact cyclin family proteins cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). study, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4 gene shown potential tumor suppressor characteristics. PDK4 expression significantly downregulated human HCC. Pdk4(-/-) mouse liver exhibited consistent increase cell cycle regulator proteins, including cyclin D1, cyclin E1, cyclin A2, associated CDKs, transcription factor E2F1. PDK4-knockdown HCC cells also progressed faster cell cycle, concurrently expressed high levels cyclins E2F1 seen Pdk4(-/-) mice. Interestingly, induced cyclin E1 cyclin A2 caused Pdk4 deficiency repressed arsenic treatment mouse liver HCC cells. E2f1 deficiency E2f1(-/-) mouse liver knockdown E2F1 using small hairpin RNAs HCC cells significantly decreased cyclin E1, cyclin A2, E2F1 proteins. contrast, inhibition PDK4 activity HCC cells increased cyclin E1, cyclin A2, E2F1 proteins. findings demonstrate PDK4 critical regulator hepatocyte proliferation via E2F1-mediated regulation cyclins.
