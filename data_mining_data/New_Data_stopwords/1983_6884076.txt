 exogenous cues overwintering adaptations vary components hardening species. One species, P. brevicornis, initiates glycerol synthesis response 0 degree C exposures second species, E. solidaginis, increases glycerol levels response temperature apparent association changes total body mass. species maintains constant annual percentage water occupying hibernaculum dries considerably. overwintering, E. solidaginis losses approximately 50% total body mass. addition changes described, species (northern populations) increases amount water bound protein low-molecular-weight compounds hardening. increase binding exceeds threefold 25 -30 degrees C (0.193 0.633 g/g dry wt) (29). data unequivocally demonstrate existence hydration trigger glycerol synthesis adequate put forth hypothesis. decrease total bulk water levels due wet weight loss increases bound water may provide conditions functionally reduced intracellular metabolic water. Since polyol production necessitates disruption carbon flow glucose-6-phosphate pyruvate, one enzymes may sensitive water reductions. Pyruvate kinase sensitive available water levels. Inhibition enzyme would likely cause shunting carbon metabolism glycerol production. hypothesis becomes attractive light observation variety species, glycerol accumulations correlated dehydration hyperosmotic conditions. common adaptative mechanism may exist response apparently different environmental perturbations.
