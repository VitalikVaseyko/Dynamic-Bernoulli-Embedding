 vivo effect dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) hepatic glycogen content glucose metabolizing enzymes investigated male female Sprague-Dawley rats treated 0.6% (w/w) DHEA diet 3, 7, 14, 28 140 days. glycolytic enzymes studied (glucokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase) showed significant persistent decrease activity sexes 3-7 days treatment. Gluconeogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) increased 3 days, decreased 7-14 days. Glycolytic enzymes showed stronger reduction gluconeogenic enzymes. Females slightly affected males. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase unchanged females, increased males. Glycogen content activity glycogen phosphorylase reduced 3 days treatment. mRNA analysis glucokinase phosphorylase indicated enzyme alterations accompanied reduced transcriptional expression, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels unchanged. Withdrawal DHEA 4 week-treated rats associated almost complete reversibility enzyme alterations 2 weeks. long-term treatment (140 days) glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activities longer altered. Since DHEA treatment affects key enzymes glucose metabolic pathways sense, suggested DHEA regulate individual enzymes rather common regulatory factors signalling pathways.
