 Pyruvate kinase catalyzes phosphorylation 3-nitro-2-hydroxypropionate ATP. product (3-nitro-2-phosphopropionate) decomposes nonenzymatically inactivates enzyme. inactivation process irreversible enzyme completely protected inactivation mercaptoethanol competitive inhibitor oxalate. Km 3-nitro-2-hydroxypropionate (DL) 40 mM kcat = 5 s-1 pH 8.6. terms kcat/km, 3-nitro-2-hydroxypropionate fourfold better substrate glycolate.
