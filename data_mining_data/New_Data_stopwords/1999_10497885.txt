 Chronic sepsis promotes stable increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) activity skeletal muscle. PDHK found tightly bound pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex free kinase. investigated ability sepsis modify activity PDHK intrinsic PDH free PDHK. Sepsis induced intraabdominal introduction fecal-agar pellet infected E. coli B. fragilis. Five days later, mitochondria isolated skeletal muscle PDHK measured mitochondrial extracts. Sepsis caused approximate 2-fold stimulation PDHK. mitochondrial extracts control septic rats fractionated gel chromatography Sephacryl S-300 separate PDHK intrinsic PDH complex free PDHK. PDH complex eluted void volume assayed PDHK intrinsic complex. activity PDHK intrinsic PDH complex significantly increased 3 fold sepsis. Free PDHK activity eluted PDH complex activity enhanced 70% sepsis. Incubation PDHK intrinsic PDH dichloroactate, uncompetitive inhibitor PDHK, showed PDHK septic rats relatively less sensitive inhibition controls. results indicate sepsis induces stable changes PDHK skeletal muscle.
