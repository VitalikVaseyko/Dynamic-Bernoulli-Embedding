 exploiting kinetics NADH consumption enzyme system creatinine amidohydrolase + creatine kinase + pyruvate kinase + lactate dehydrogenase, one determine creatinine serum range 1 90 mg/L. using conditions defined here, determination made single measurement rate disappearance NADH. analytical rate measurement made fixed time (2 min) sample introduced enzyme solution. fixed time, interferences creatine pyruvate eliminated. Results obtained creatinine human blood serum samples correlated well (r = 0.98) obtained classical Jaffe-reaction method. Run-to-run reproducibility (CV) 3%, limit detection 1 mg/L.
