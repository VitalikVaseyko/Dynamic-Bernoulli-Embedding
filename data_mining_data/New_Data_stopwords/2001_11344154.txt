 Two mutant strains Lactococcus lactis promoter las operon, harboring pfk, pyk, ldh, replaced synthetic promoters constructed. las mutants approximately twofold decrease activity phosphofructokinase, whereas activities pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase remained closer wild-type level. defined medium supplemented glucose, growth rate mutants reduced 57 70% wild-type levels glycolytic flux reduced 62 76% wild-type levels. complex medium growth even reduced. Surprisingly, mutants still showed homolactic fermentation, indicated limitation different standard glucose-limited conditions. One explanation could reduced activity phosphofructokinase resulted accumulation sugar-phosphates. Indeed, one mutants starved glucose glucose-limited chemostat, growth rate could gradually increased 195% growth rate observed glucose-saturated batch culture, suggesting phosphofructokinase affect concentration upstream metabolites. pools glucose-6-phosphate fructose-6-phosphate subsequently found increased two- fourfold las mutants, indicates phosphofructokinase exerts strong control concentration metabolites.
