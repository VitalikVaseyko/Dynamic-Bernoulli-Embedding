 PURPOSE REVIEW: Global climate change population explosion leading changes natural ecosystem travel across continents resulted increase transmission parasites human beings. review focuses recent advancements parasitic lung infections. RECENT FINDINGS: Invasive parasitic diseases including lung infections increasingly reported patients immunodeficiency syndromes. recombinant kinesin-related antigen Leishmania donovani validated ELISA using urine samples diagnosis visceral leishmaniasis. Pyruvate kinase deficiency shown provide protection Plasmodium falciparum infection. Intravenous artesunate alternative drug treatment severe malaria. best way protect malaria use long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets. Biennial treatment praziquantel found cost-effective treatment control infection Schistosoma haematobium. Pulmonary paragonimiasis diagnosed fine needle aspiration biopsy pulmonary nodules. Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection mimic accelerated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Migratory nodular shadows halos important chest computed tomographic findings human toxocariasis. SUMMARY: Patients immunodeficiency syndromes (HIV infection, organ transplantation immunosuppressive drugs, including corticosteroids) evaluated early detection parasitic lung infections.
