 dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2)-protein X-kinase subcomplex resolved produce oligomeric transacetylase free protein X kinase subunits. investigated properties transacetylase E2 oligomer form subcomplex lipoyl-bearing domain protein X (XL) removed. retaining catalytic binding properties native subcomplex, oligomeric transacetylase subcomplex lacking XL domain greatly reduced capacities support overall reaction complex (upon reconstitution components) bind dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase component. results indicate protein X, part XL domain, contributes binding dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase component overall reaction complex.
