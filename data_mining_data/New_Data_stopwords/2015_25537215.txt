 UNLABELLED: known glycolysis contributes survival tumor cells providing energetic plastic substrates. Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibitor kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase shifts balance energy metabolism tumor cells aerobic glycolysis towards oxidative phosphorylation. aim study investigate cytostatic/cytotoxic effect DCA glioma C6 cells conditions different oxygenation cell incubation medium. MATERIALS METHODS: DCA action glioma C6 cells investigated upon conditions normoxia, hypoxia (1% oxygen) hyperoxia (30% 95% oxygen) vitro. number viability tumor cells assessed using trypan blue dye-exclusion test. Apoptosis determined using dye Hoechst 33258. Lactate production tumor cells determined enzymatic method using lactate dehydrogenase. Cell cycle distribution studied using flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content evaluated using 2 ,7 -dichlorofluorescein diacetate. RESULTS: data vitro cytotoxicity, upon hypoxia IC50 value DCA three times lower (p < 0.05) upon normoxic conditions (18.2 +/- 3.9 mM vs. 51.2 +/- 8.1 mM). Hypoxia enhanced ROS production glioma cells 113.5% (p < 0.05) correlated increase apoptosis 292% (p < 0.05). hypoxic glioma C6 cells DCA significantly influence ROS production, decreased hypoxia-induced apoptosis 3.5-6.5 times (p < 0.05) significantly increased cell death rates via necrosis (p < 0.05). contrast hypoxia, upon conditions hyperoxia IC50 values DCA differ corre-sponding values upon normoxia conditions 30% 95%oxygen content equal 35.8 +/- 7.2 mM 42.3 +/- 5.1 mM respectively. CONCLUSION: According obtained results, hypoxia enhances cytostatic/cytotoxic effects DCA glioma C6 cells via high level DCA-induced necrosis tumor cells hypoxia-induced ROS hyperproduction.
