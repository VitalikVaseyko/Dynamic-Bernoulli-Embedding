 Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) fly 9,000 elevation migration Himalayas, sustaining high metabolic rates severe hypoxia altitudes. investigated evolution cardiac energy metabolism O(2) transport species better understand molecular physiological mechanisms high-altitude adaptation. Compared low-altitude geese (pink-footed geese barnacle geese), bar-headed geese larger lungs higher capillary densities left ventricle heart, improve O(2) diffusion hypoxia. Although myoglobin abundance activities many metabolic enzymes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase, citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase) showed minor variation species, bar-headed geese striking alteration kinetics cytochrome c oxidase (COX), heteromeric enzyme catalyzes O(2) reduction oxidative phosphorylation. reflected lower maximum catalytic activity higher affinity reduced cytochrome c. small differences species messenger RNA protein expression COX subunits 3 4, inconsistent divergence enzyme kinetics. However, COX3 gene bar-headed geese contained nonsynonymous substitution site otherwise conserved across vertebrates resulted major functional change amino acid class (Trp-116 --> Arg). mutation predicted structural modeling alter interaction COX3 COX1. Adaptations mitochondrial enzyme kinetics O(2) transport capacity may therefore contribute exceptional ability bar-headed geese fly high.
