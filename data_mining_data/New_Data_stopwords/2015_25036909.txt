 OBJECTIVES: Akt kinase-interacting protein 1 (Aki1) reported scaffold protein PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase)/Akt pathway interact epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Although Aki1 reported expressed lung cancer, significance expression pancreatic cancer clarified. METHODS: expression Aki1 associated proteins assayed pancreatic cancer cell lines, involvement cell viability examined treatment Aki1 small interfering RNA. also assessed immunohistochemical expression Aki1 tissue samples 60 patients pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: pancreatic cancer cell lines expressed Aki1 associated proteins various levels. Treatment Aki1 small interfering RNA PI3K inhibitor inhibited viability Panc1 cells. Silencing Aki1 Panc1 cells reduced phosphorylation Akt increased phosphorylation cleaved PARP. Aki1 expressed 25 (42%) 60 pancreatic cancers, correlation Aki1 expression clinicopathologic parameters. observed statistically significant correlation Aki1 p-Akt expression (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition Aki1-Akt axis may therapeutic target patients pancreatic cancer.
