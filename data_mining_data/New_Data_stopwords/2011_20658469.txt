 Exposure airborne PM(1)(0), particulate matter median aerodynamic diameter less 10 microm, known associated number adverse health effects. gain better understanding cytotoxic mechanism develop protein biomarker candidates PM(1)(0)-induced toxicity, proteomic analyses performed human lung epithelial cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyze proteins differentially expressed exposure PM(1)(0). Analysis 2-DE gels revealed 1270 protein spots cells, 36 showed changes 2-fold exposure PM(1)(0) (up-regulation, n = 6; down-regulation, n = 30). glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase, also plays role tumor metabolism, showed marked increase expression, whereas cytoskeleton-related vinculin anti-inflammatory annexin 1 showed marked decreases expression.
