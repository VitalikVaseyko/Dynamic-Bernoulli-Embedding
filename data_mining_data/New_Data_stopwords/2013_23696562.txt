 Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize arachidonic acid biologically active cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, potent vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, antiapoptotic, antidiabetes properties. Here, showed effects cardiac-specific overexpression CYP epoxygenase 2J2 (CYP2J2) diabetic cardiomyopathy insulin resistance high-fat (HF) diet fed, low-dose streptozotocin-treated mice. Diabetic cardiomyopathy induced HF streptozotocin cardiac-specific CYP2J2 transgenic mice. Physiological parameters systemic metabolic parameters monitored using ELISA kits. Intraperitoneal injection glucose tolerance test hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study implied indicate insulin resistance. Cardiac function assessed echocardiography Millar catheter system. Real-time PCR Western blotting used signal pathway detection. alphaMHC-CYP2J2 transgenic mice showed significantly lower plasma glucose insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance, increased cardiac glucose uptake. Furthermore, alphaMHC-CYP2J2 transgenic mice significantly protected HF-streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy. Strikingly, CYP2J2 overexpression attenuated myocardial hypertrophy induced diabetes. conclude cardiac-specific overexpression CYP2J2 significantly protects diabetic cardiomyopathy, may due improved cardiac insulin resistance, glucose uptake, reversal cardiac hypertrophy. Relevant mechanisms may include up-regulation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, activation insulin receptor AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, inhibition nuclear factor activated cells c3 signal enhanced atrial natriuretic peptide production. results suggest CYP2J2 epoxygenase metabolites likely play important role plasma glucose homeostasis, enhancement epoxyeicosatrienoic acids activation may serve effective therapeutic strategy prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy.
