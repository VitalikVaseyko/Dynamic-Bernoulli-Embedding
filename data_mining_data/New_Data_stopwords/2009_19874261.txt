 Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) one fatal cancers humans rising incidence many regions around world. Currently, satisfactory curative pharmacological treatment available, outcome mostly poor. Recently, shown glucose transporter GLUT1 increased subset patients HCC functionally affects tumorigenicity. GLUT1 rate-limiting transporter glucose uptake, expression correlates anaerobic glycolysis. phenomenon also known Warburg effect recently became great interest, since affects glucose uptake utilization also influence tumorigenic features like metastasis, chemoresistance escape immune surveillance. Consistent this, RNA-interference-mediated inhibition GLUT1 expression HCC cells resulted reduced tumorigenicity. Together, findings indicate GLUT1 novel attractive therapeutic target HCC. review summarizes current knowledge expression function GLUT1 HCC, available drugs/strategies inhibit GLUT1 expression function, potential side effects therapeutic strategies.
