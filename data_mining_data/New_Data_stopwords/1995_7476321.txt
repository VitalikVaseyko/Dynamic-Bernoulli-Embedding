 relative roles pyruvate kinase malic enzyme substrate cycling pyruvate oxaloacetate examined perfused livers 24-hour-fasted normal triiodothyronine (T3)-treated rats using inhibitor malic enzyme (hydroxymalonate). Livers perfused 60 minutes recirculating system [3-13C]alanine (10 mmol/L, 99% 13C-enriched). combined flux pyruvate kinase plus malic enzyme relative pyruvate carboxylase flux assessed 13C-enrichment ratio alanine C2 glucose C5 perfusate, determined 13C 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. normal rat livers, relative carbon flux pyruvate kinase plus malic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase 0.18 +/- 0.04, increased 0.44 +/- 0.08 (P < .05) T3-treated group. addition hydroxymalonate, relative carbon flux unchanged normal rat livers, decreased 0.15 +/- 0.04 (P < .01) T3-treated group, suggesting increased carbon flux T3-treated livers caused increased flux malic enzyme. Malic enzyme activity increased 0.36 +/- 0.05 U/g liver normal livers 2.51 +/- 0.50 U/g liver (P < .05) T3-treated group, whereas effect T3 treatment pyruvate kinase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
