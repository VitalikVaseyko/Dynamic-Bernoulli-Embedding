 Mitochondrial dysfunction often associated aging neurodegeneration. c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation translocation mitochondria increased function age rat brain. associated decrease pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity upon phosphorylation E(1alpha) subunit PDH. Phosphorylation PDH likely mediated PDH kinase, protein levels activity increased age. ATP levels diminished, whereas lactic acid levels increased, thus indicating shift toward anaerobic glycolysis. energy transduction deficit due impairment PDH activity aging may associated JNK signaling.
