 Purpose assess mouse model whether early late components glucose metabolism, exemplified fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) hyperpolarized carbon 13 ((13)C)-pyruvate magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, serve indicators response ovarian cancer multityrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib. Materials Methods Animal Care Use Committee approved study, 17 days injection 2 x 10(6) human ovarian SKOV3 tumors cells 14 female nude mice, treatment vehicle pazopanib (2.5 mg per mouse peroral every day) initiated. Longitudinal T2-weighted MR imaging, dynamic MR spectroscopy hyperpolarized pyruvate, (18)F-FDG PET/computed tomographic (CT) imaging performed treatment, 2 days treatment, 2 weeks treatment. Results Pazopanib inhibited ovarian tumor growth compared control (0.054 g +/- 0.041 vs 0.223 g +/- 0.112, respectively; six mice treated pazopanib seven control mice; P < .05). Significantly higher pyruvate-to-lactate conversion (lactate/pyruvate + lactate ratio) found 2 days treatment pazopanib treatment (0.46 +/- 0.07 vs 0.31 +/- 0.14, respectively; P < .05; six tumors treatment, seven tumors treatment). observed control group (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Conclusion findings suggest hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate MR spectroscopy may serve early indicator response tyrosine kinase (angiogenesis) inhibitors pazopanib ovarian cancer even (18)F-FDG PET/CT indicate response.
