 longstanding debate whether cancer one disease set diverse diseases. goal paper suggest strongly (if all) hallmarks cancer could consequence Warburg's effect. result metabolic impairment oxidative phosphorylation, decrease ATP concentration. compensate reduced energy yield, massive glucose uptake, anaerobic glycolysis, up-regulation Pentose Phosphate Pathway resulting increased biosynthesis leading increased cell division local pressure. increased pressure responsible fractal shape tumor, secretion collagen fibroblasts plays critical role metastatic spread. massive extrusion lactic acid contributes extracellular acidity activation immune system. decreased oxidative phosphorylation leads impairment CO2 levels inside outside cell, increased intracellular alkalosis contribution carbonic acid extracellular acidosis-mediated least two cancer-associated carbonic anhydrase isoforms. increased intracellular alkalosis strong mitogenic signal, bypasses inhibitory signals. Mitochondrial disappearance (such seen aggressive tumors) consequence mitochondrial swelling, result decreased ATP concentration. transmembrane pumps, extrude, mitochondria, ions, water, ATP-dependant. Therapy aiming increasing number efficacy mitochondria could useful.
