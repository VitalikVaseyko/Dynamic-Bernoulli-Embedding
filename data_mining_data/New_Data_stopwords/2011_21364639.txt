 alphaA-crystallin molecular chaperone antiapoptotic protein. study investigated mechanism inhibition apoptosis human alphaA-crystallin determined chaperone activity alphaA-crystallin required antiapoptotic function. alphaA-crystallin inhibited chemical-induced apoptosis Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells HeLa cells inhibiting activation caspase-3 -9. CHO cells, inhibited apoptosis induced overexpression human proapoptotic proteins, Bim Bax. alphaA-crystallin inhibited doxorubicin-mediated activation human procaspase-3 CHO cells activated PI3K/Akt cell survival pathway promoting phosphorylation PDK1, Akt phosphatase tensin homologue HeLa cells. phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) activity increased alphaA-crystallin overexpression protein content unaltered. Downregulation PI3K expression dominant-negative mutant inhibition LY294002 abrogated ability alphaA-crystallin phosphorylate Akt. antiapoptotic functions alphaA-crystallin enhanced mutant protein (R21A) shows increased chaperone activity wild-type (Wt) protein. Interestingly, mutant protein (R49A) shows decreased chaperone activity far weaker Wt protein antiapoptotic functions. Together, study results show alphaA-crystallin inhibits apoptosis enhancing PI3K activity inactivating phosphatase tensin homologue antiapoptotic function directly related chaperone activity.
