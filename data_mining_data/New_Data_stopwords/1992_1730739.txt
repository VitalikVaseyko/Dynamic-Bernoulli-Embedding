 examine role primary amino acid sequence localization proteins within nucleus, studied nucleolar protein NO38 amphibian oocytes. synthesized NO38 transcripts vitro, injected oocyte cytoplasm, followed distribution translation products. injected RNA contained short sequence encoding epitope derived human c-myc protein. used mAb epitope detect translation products injected RNAs Western blots immunofluoresent staining cytological preparations. full-length transcripts NO38 injected oocytes, translation products accumulated efficiently germinal vesicle, major fraction localized multiple nucleoli. identify protein domains involved nucleolus-specific accumulation, prepared series carboxy-terminal deletions cDNA. Oocytes injected RNA encoding truncated forms NO38 examined altered patterns protein accumulation. defined domain 24 amino acids near carboxy terminus essential nucleolar localization NO38. domain separated 70 amino acids two putative nuclear localization signals near middle molecule. Hybrid constructs made encoded part Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase pyruvate kinase fused long segment NO38 containing essential domain. Injection RNA constructs showed essential domain sufficient target hybrid proteins nucleolus. suggest nucleolar accumulation NO38 requires single linear domain.
