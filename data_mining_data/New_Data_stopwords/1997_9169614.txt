 glycolytic enzyme enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) active dimers formed three subunits encoded different genes. embryonic alphaalpha isoform remains distributed many adult cell types, whereas transition towards betabeta gammagamma isoforms occurs striated muscle cells neurons respectively. understood enolase exhibits tissue-specific isoforms close functional properties. approached problem purification native betabeta-enolase mouse hindlimb muscles raising specific antibodies high titre protein. reagents useful revealing heterogeneity beta-enolase subunit changes vivo vitro maturation. basic carboxypeptidase appears involved generating acidic beta-enolase variant, may regulate plasminogen binding subunit. show first time pure betabeta-enolase binds high affinity adjacent enzymes glycolytic pathway (pyruvate kinase phosphoglycerate mutase), favouring hypothesis three enzymes form functional glycolytic segment. betabeta-Enolase binds high affinity sarcomeric troponin actin tropomyosin. binding properties shared alphaalpha-isoenolase, also expressed striated muscle, neuron-specific gammagamma-enolase. results support idea specific interactions macromolecules address muscle enolase isoforms subcellular site ATP, produced glycolysis, needed contraction. specific targeting could modulated post-translational modifications.
