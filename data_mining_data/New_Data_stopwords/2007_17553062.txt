 differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) signal molecule induces stalk cell formation cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, DIF-1 analogs shown possess antiproliferative activity vitro mammalian tumor cells. present study, investigated effects DIF-1 analogs normal (nontransformed) mammalian cells. Without affecting cell morphology cell number, DIF-1 micromolar levels dose-dependently promoted glucose uptake confluent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, inhibited wortmannin LY294002 (inhibitors phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). DIF-1 affected neither expression level glucose transporter 1 activities four key enzymes involved glucose metabolism, hexokinase, fluctose 6-phosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. importantly, stimulation DIF-1 found induce translocation glucose transporter 1 intracellular vesicles plasma membranes cells. differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, DIF-1 induced translocation glucose trasporter 1 (but glucose transporter 4) promoted glucose uptake, inhibited wortmannin. results indicate DIF-1 induces glucose transporter 1 translocation thereby promotes glucose uptake, least part, via inhibitors phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-independent pathway mammalian cells. Furthermore, analogs DIF-1 possess stronger antitumor activity DIF-1 less effective promoting glucose consumption, suggesting mechanism action DIF-1 stimulating glucose uptake different suppressing tumor cell growth.
