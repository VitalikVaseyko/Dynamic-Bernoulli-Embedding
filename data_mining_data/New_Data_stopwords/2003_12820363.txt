 tumor metabolome characterized high glycolytic glutaminolytic capacities, high phosphometabolite levels high channelling glucose carbons synthetic processes. allows tumor cells proliferate strong variations oxygen glucose supply (http://www.metabolic-database.com). One key regulator tumor metabolome glycolytic isoenzyme pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK) generally over-expressed tumor cells. M2-PK occur highly active tetrameric form nearly inactive dimeric form. tumor cells dimeric form M2-PK always predominates therefore termed tumor M2-PK. dimerization M2-PK caused direct interaction M2-PK certain oncoproteins. M2-PK dimeric state energy produced glutaminolysis. metabolic Achilles' heel tumor metabolome sensitivity reduction NAD levels caused activation poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase DNA damage.
