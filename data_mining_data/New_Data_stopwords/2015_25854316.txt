 High glucose consumption due Warburg effect one metabolic hallmarks cancer. Consequently, glucose antimetabolites, 2-deoxy-glucose (2DG), induce substantial growth inhibition cancer cells. However, inhibition metabolic pathways sole effect 2DG cancer cells. mannose-mimetic molecule, 2DG believed interfere normal glycosylation proteins cells. Here, address 2DG influences protein glycosylation cancer cells discuss possible implications consequences influence. detail, six colorectal cancer cell lines examined alterations protein glycosylation measuring monosaccharide incorporation cellular glycoproteins cell surface glycosylation lectin FACS. significant increase mannose incorporation observed treatment 2DG (1 mM 48 h), also reflected increased binding mannose-binding lectin Concanavalin FACS analysis. phenomenon, could reversed external addition mannose, caused 2DG-mediated mannosidase inhibition, shown pulse-chase experiments, arguing favor hypothesis 2DG directly influenced incorporation mannose. Increased mannose content generally observed cellular glycoproteins, including glycoproteins isolated plasma membrane fraction. results indicate 2DG low doses, limited metabolism-related effect glycosylation, induces strong increase mannose incorporation cellular glycoproteins. hand, higher 2DG concentrations (10 20 mM) led significant decrease absolute mannose incorporation accompanied dramatically reduced protein synthesis rate. 2DG-induced alterations glycosylation may represent novel mechanism potentially explaining varied effects 2DG cancer cells. Moreover, 2DG treatment may open path toward novel diagnostic cancer therapeutic approaches, specifically target altered glycoantigen structures induced 2DG.
