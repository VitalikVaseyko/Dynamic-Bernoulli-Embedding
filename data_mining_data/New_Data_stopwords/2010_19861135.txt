 Specific growth rate dependent gene expression changes Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 studied microarray real-time PCR analyses. bacteria cultivated glucose limited minimal medium using accelerostat method (A-stat) starting steady state conditions (chemostat culture) dilution rate constantly increased. specific growth rate (mu) 0.47h(-1), E. coli focused metabolism glucose utilization down-regulation alternative substrate transporters expression compared mu=0.3h(-1). found acetic acid accumulation began mu=0.34+/-0.01h(-1) two acetate synthesis pathways - phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (pta-ackA) pyruvate oxidase (poxB) - contributed synthesis beginning overflow metabolism, i.e. onset acetate excretion. hand, poxB, pta ackA expression patterns suggest pyruvate oxidase may enzyme synthesizing acetate mu=0.47h(-1). Loss glucose acetate co-utilization represented down-regulation acs-yjcH-actP operon specific growth rates 0.3-0.42h(-1) acetic acid accumulation mu=0.34+/-0.01h(-1) allows one surmise acetate utilization operon expression might play important role overflow metabolism.
