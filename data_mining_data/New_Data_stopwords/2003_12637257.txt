 Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) linked development type 2 diabetes later life. developed model uteroplacental insufficiency, common cause intrauterine growth retardation, rat. Early life, animals insulin resistant 6 mo age develop diabetes. Glycogen content insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake significantly decreased muscle IUGR rats. IUGR muscle mitochondria exhibited significantly decreased rates state 3 oxygen consumption pyruvate, glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate. Decreased pyruvate oxidation IUGR mitochondria associated decreased ATP production, decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, increased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4. defect IUGR mitochondria leads chronic reduction supply ATP available oxidative phosphorylation. Impaired ATP synthesis muscle compromises energy-dependent GLUT4 recruitment cell surface, glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, contribute insulin resistance hyperglycemia type 2 diabetes.
