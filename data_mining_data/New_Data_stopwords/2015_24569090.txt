 Recent studies show metabolic patterns typical cancer cells, including aerobic glycolysis increased lipogenesis, unique malignancy, rather originate physiologic development. postnatal brain, sufficient oxygen energy metabolism scrupulously maintained, neural progenitors nevertheless metabolize glucose lactate prioritize lipid synthesis fatty acid oxidation. Medulloblastoma, cancer neural progenitors common malignant brain tumor children, recapitulates metabolic phenotype brain progenitor cells. physiologic proliferation neural progenitors, metabolic enzymes generally associated malignancy, including Hexokinase 2 (Hk2) Pyruvate kinase M2 (PkM2) configure energy metabolism support growth. non-malignant cells, expression Hk2 PkM2 driven transcriptional regulators typically identified oncogenes, including N-myc. Importantly, N-myc continues drive Hk2 PkM2 medulloblastoma. Similarly E2F transcription factors PPARgamma function progenitors medulloblastoma optimize energy metabolism support proliferation. findings show "metabolic transformation" hallmark cancer specifically limited cancer. Rather, metabolic transformation represents co-opting developmental programs integral physiologic growth. Despite physiologic origins, molecular mechanisms mediate metabolic transformation may nevertheless present ideal targets novel anti-tumor therapy.
