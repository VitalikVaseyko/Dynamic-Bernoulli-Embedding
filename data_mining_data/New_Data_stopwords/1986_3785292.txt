 improved purification scheme isolation Ascaris suum pyruvate dehydrogenase complex directly body wall muscle developed yields fully activated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex substantial PDHa kinase activity. apparent Km coenzyme (CoA) much lower previously reported accurately measured presence CoA-regenerating system. alpha-pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit ascarid complex unique migration sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gels altered phosphorylation. PDHa kinase activity inhibited ADP, thiamine pyrophosphate, physiological levels pyruvate propionate. contrast, PDHa kinase activity stimulated elevated NADH/NAD+ acetyl CoA/CoA ratios, although appears NADH/NAD+ ratios required half-maximal stimulation order magnitude greater reported mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes.
