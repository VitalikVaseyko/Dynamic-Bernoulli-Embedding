 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) common inherited peripheral neuropathy. Mutations pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 3 (PDK3) gene found cause X-linked dominant CMT type 6 (CMTX6). study identified p.R158H PDK3 mutation screening 67 probable X-linked CMT families. mutation fully segregated phenotype, genotyping family indicated mutation arose different haplotype compared original Australian CMTX6 family. Results bisulphite sequencing suggest methylated deamination CpG dinucleotide may cause recurrent p.R158H mutation. frequency p.R158H PDK3 mutation Koreans rare. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed fatty infiltration involving distal muscles lower extremities. addition, fatty infiltrations predominantly observed soleus muscles, lesser extent tibialis anterior muscles. differs demyelinating CMT1A patients similar axonal CMT2A patients. clinical, neuroimaging, electrophysiological findings second CMTX6 family p.R158H PDK3 mutation similar axonal neuropathy reported Australian family.
