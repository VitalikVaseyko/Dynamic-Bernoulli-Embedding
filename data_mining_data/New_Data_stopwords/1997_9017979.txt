 pyruvate kinase deficiency prevalence study determination normal levels enzyme performed Antalya city, Turkey. Heparinized blood samples obtained representative population Antalya province (617 women 573 men) tested pyruvate kinase deficiency qualitative quantitative tests April 1992 March 1994. mean pyruvate kinase activity found 19.8 +/- 4.0 IU/g Hb whereas enzyme activity deficient cases varied 7.5 12.2 IU/g Hb. Taking account pyruvate kinase deficiency second common cause nonspherocytic congenital hemolytic anemia, detection deficient cases genetic screening tests appears informative clinical indicator hemolytic anemia.
