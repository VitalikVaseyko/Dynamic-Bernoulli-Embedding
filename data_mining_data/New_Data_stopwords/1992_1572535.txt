 Current models predict large increases wild-type activity one enzyme alter organism's fitness. prediction tested Saccharomyces cerevisiae use high copy plasmid bears one following: hexokinase B (HEXB), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), phosphofructokinase (PFKA PFKB), pyruvate kinase (PYK). Transformants containing plasmids demonstrate four ten-fold increase enzyme specific activity either parent strain transformants containing plasmid alone. Haploid diploid transformants derived independent backgrounds grown fermentable non-fermentable carbon sources evaluated several components fitness. include growth rate non-limiting conditions, maximum stationary phase density, viability extended batch culture. Cell viability affected overproduction enzymes. Growth rate stationary phase density differ significantly among strains overexpress HEXB, PGI contain vector alone. PFKA, B transformants show reduced growth rate glucose one background only. loci current model confirmed. contrast, grown glucose, yeast overexpressing PYK demonstrate reduced growth rate increased stationary phase density backgrounds. effects abolished cells containing plasmids Tn5 disrupted copy PYK gene. results consistent reports PYK locus may exert control yeast cell cycle suggest challenging model relations fitness activity multifunctional proteins.
