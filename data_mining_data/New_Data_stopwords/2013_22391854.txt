 investigation, combined effects quercetin atenolol regulation isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity evaluated rats. ISO administration increased levels serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) well cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA); reduced activities superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase level reduced glutathione. ISO-induced rats also exhibited ST-segment elevation tachycardia. Oral administration atenolol (6 mg/kg) quercetin (5 mg/kg), along ISO (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) every day 10 days markedly reduced serum CK-MB, LDH SGPT levels. Concomitantly test drugs improved status antioxidative enzymes, decreased cardiac MDA nearly normalized electrocardiogram. Electron paramagnetic resonance study also revealed decrease 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyroline-N-oxide-hydroxyl radicals signal intensity atenolol quercetin administered together ISO-treated rats. conclusion, combined treatment atenolol quercetin appears produce better cardioprotective effect ISO-induced animals compared individual treatments, possibly beneficial actions associated free radical scavenging action quercetin.
