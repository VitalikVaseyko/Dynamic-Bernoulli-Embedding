 Background: Metabolism glutamine glutaminase 1 (GLS1) plays key role tumor cell proliferation via generation ATP intermediates required macromolecular synthesis. hypothesized glutamine metabolism also plays role proliferation autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cells inhibiting GLS1 could slow cyst growth animal models ADPKD. Methods: Primary normal human kidney ADPKD human cyst-lining epithelial cells cultured presence absence two pharmacologic inhibitors GLS1, bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide 3 (BPTES) CB-839, effect proliferation, cyst growth collagen activation downstream signaling pathways assessed. determined inhibiting GLS1 vivo CB-839 Aqp2-Cre; Pkd1fl/fl Pkhd1-Cre; Pkd1fl/fl mouse models ADPKD slowed cyst growth. Results: found isoform GLS1 (GLS1-GAC) upregulated cyst-lining epithelia human ADPKD kidneys mouse models ADPKD. BPTES CB-839 blocked forskolin-induced cyst formation vitro. Inhibiting GLS1 vivo CB-839 led variable outcomes two mouse models ADPKD. CB-839 slowed cyst growth Aqp2-Cre; Pkd1fl/fl mice, Pkhd1-Cre; Pkd1fl/fl mice. CB-839 inhibited mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) MEK activation Aqp2-Cre; Pkd1fl/fl, Pkhd1-Cre; Pkd1fl/fl mice. Conclusion: findings provide support alteration glutamine metabolism may play role cyst growth. However, testing models PKD identification compensatory metabolic changes bypass GLS1 inhibition critical validate GLS1 drug target either alone combined inhibitors metabolic pathways.
