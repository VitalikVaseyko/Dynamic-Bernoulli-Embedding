 erythrocyte enzyme-systems acid phosphatase, phosphoglucomutase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, adenosine desaminase, adenylate kinase, glyoxase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase esterase-D-isoenzyme phenotypes studied percentile distribution compared incidence diseases X-linked recessive heredity, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) haemophilia-A, hemizygous male children heterozygous mothers. Considering frequency distribution mentioned isoenzyme phenotypes enzyme-systems DMD, phenotypes proved homogeneous, X transmitted 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) isoenzyme types found genetic markers DMD hemizygotes heterozygotes. genotypes 6-PGD phenotype showed decrease phenotypes 6-PGD AB B significantly increased. adenylate kinase (AK) 2-1 isoenzyme phenotype increased 25% population frequency 6.34%, AK 1-1 phenotype occurred 75% population frequency 93.59%, showing significantly decreasing tendency haemophilia-A hemizygotes heterozygotes.
