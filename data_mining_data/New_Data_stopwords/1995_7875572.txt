 phoD gene encoding membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (ALPI) Zymomonas mobilis CP4 cloned sequenced. translated sequence properties recombinant enzyme unusual. Z. mobilis ALPI monomeric (M(r) 62,926) hydrolysed nucleotides effectively sugar phosphates. translated sequence contained single hydrophobic segment near N-terminus may serve membrane-anchor Z. mobilis, although recombinant enzyme recovered cytoplasmic fraction Escherichia coli. predicted amino acid sequence ALPI align well ALPs known genes. However, similarity E. coli ALP noted metal-binding phosphate-binding regions. Two regions identified similarity active sites pyruvate kinase mammalian 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (also membrane-bound), respectively. likely Z. mobilis phoD represents new class alkaline phosphatase genes described previously.
