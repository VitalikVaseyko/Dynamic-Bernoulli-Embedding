 Homogeneous liver pyruvate kinase reacted different sulfhydryl reagents, included o-iodosobenzoate, 5',5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) N-ethylmaleimide. Activity determinations treated enzyme made without Fru(1,6)P2 indicate protein contains two sulfhydryl groups per subunit important properties, one accessible other. Fru(1,6)P2 added mixtures prevented loss activity obtained o-iodosobenzoate 5',5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). appears Fru(1,6)P2 interfere reaction reagent sulfhydryl group, prevents ensuing conformational change, leads changes enzyme's properties.
