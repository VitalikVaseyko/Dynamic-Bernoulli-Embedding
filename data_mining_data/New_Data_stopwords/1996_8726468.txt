 interference various SH-blocking chemicals insulin-controlled regulation hepatic carbohydrate metabolism studied rat hepatocyte primary cultures. organic mercurials PCMB, PCMBS, mersalyl disulphide agents DTP, CPDS, disulfiram SH-alkylating reagent NEM used experimental SH-blocking model compounds. studied compounds, except NEM, induced increased glycogen deposition comparable physiological insulin-induced glycogen-deposition. PCMBS appeared effective insulin-mimicking anabolic trigger. action insulin molecule potentiated PCMBS well demonstrated increased glycogen deposition, induced pyruvate kinase (PK) decreased phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK) activity. However, cell-exposure insulin PCMBS relatively high doses destructive, demonstrated decreased glycogen levels, probably result insulin-receptor overstimulation metabolic stress. Thus, SH-blocking compounds able trigger insulin-dependent metabolic processes. relatively non-permeant organic mercurial PCMBS proved effective insulin-mimicking SH-blocking compound.
