 Astrocytes important glial cells brain providing metabolic support neurons well contributing brain signaling. different functional levels highly coordinated allow proper cell brain function. study, show astrocytes NAD(+) /NADH redox state modulates dopamine-induced Ca(2+) signals thereby connecting metabolism Ca(2+) signaling. Application dopamine induced dose-dependent increase Ca(2+) signal frequency cells, dependent D(1) -receptor signaling, glycolytic activity, increase cytosolic NADH inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor operated intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Application dopamine low concentration (1 muM) induce increase Ca(2+) signal frequency itself. However, simultaneously increasing cytosolic NADH content either direct application NADH application lactate resulted pronounced increase Ca(2+) signal frequency. increase could blocked co-application pyruvate, suggesting indeed NAD(+) /NADH redox state regulating Ca(2+) signals. conclude NAD(+) /NADH redox state metabolic signaling information integrated astrocytes, thereby likely contributing precisely coordinate different tasks astrocytes.
