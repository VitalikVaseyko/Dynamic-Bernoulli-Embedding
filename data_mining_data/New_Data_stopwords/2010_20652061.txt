 cultured clear-cell renal carcinoma (CCRCC) 786-0 cells transfected HIF1alpha (HIF-1+), HIF-2alpha (HIF-2+), empty vector (EV), significant differences observed growth rates vitro, grown vivo xenografts HIF-2alpha significantly increased, HIF-1alpha significantly decreased growth rates, compared EV tumors. Factors associated proliferation increased factors associated cell death decreased HIF-2+ tumors. Metabolite profiles showed higher glucose lower lactate alanine levels HIF-2+ tumors whilst immunostaining demonstrated higher pyruvate dehydrogenase lower pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, compared control tumors. Taken together, results suggest overexpression HIF-2alpha CCRCC 786-0 tumors regulated growth maintaining low level glycolysis allowing mitochondrial metabolism tolerance ROS induced DNA damage. growth profiles observed may mediated adaptive changes oxidative phenotype.
