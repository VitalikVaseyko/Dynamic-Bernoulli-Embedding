 UNLABELLED: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) common cancer arising kidney adults, clear cell RCC (ccRCC) representing majority RCCs. Expression human HIF1alpha triple-mutant (P402A, P564A, N803A) construct proximal tubule cells C57BL/6 mice [TRAnsgenic model Cancer Kidney (TRACK); ref. 1] mimics histologic changes found early stage human ccRCC. better understand genomic landscape, high-throughput sequence analysis performed cDNA libraries (RNAseq) derived TRACK transgenic positive (TG(+)) kidney cortex along human ccRCC transcripts Oncomine Cancer Genome Atlas databases. Importantly, expression profiles TRACK TG(+) kidneys show significant similarities observed human ccRCC, including increased expression genes involved glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle. transcripts overexpressed TRACK mouse model human ccRCC include ANKRD37, CA9, EGLN3, HK2, NDUFA4L2, SLC16A3. data suggest constitutive activation HIF1alpha kidney proximal tubule cells transcriptionally reprograms regulation metabolic pathways kidney HIF1alpha major contributor altered metabolism observed human ccRCC. IMPLICATIONS: TRACK (GGT-HIF1alphaM3) kidney mRNA profiles show similarities human ccRCC transcriptome phenotypes associated Warburg effect.
