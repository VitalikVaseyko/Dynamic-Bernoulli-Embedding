 Recent studies demonstrated glycolytic enzymes reversibly associate form heterogeneous enzyme-enzyme (binary) complexes vitro. However, kinetic analysis complexes shown individual enzymes varied response complex formation: enzymes inhibited, activated unaffected. order determine potential role binary complexes regulating glycolytic flux, mathematically calculated enzyme distributions activities using data vitro binding kinetic studies. calculations suggest that, overall, formation binary complexes would lower flux phosphofructokinase aldolase, would increase flux glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase, would affect flux triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase pyruvate kinase. implications results discussed respect effect complex formation overall glycolytic flux flux individual enzyme loci.
