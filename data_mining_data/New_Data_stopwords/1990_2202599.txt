 allosteric properties fructose-1,6-bis-phosphate-activated pyruvate kinase Escherichia coli examined presence number fructose bisphosphate analogues, well increased ionic strength (NaCl) hydrogen-bond-breaking agent, formamide. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate gave allosteric activation (additive fructose 1,6-bisphosphate). Formamide always decreased Vmax, left unchanged Km phosphoenolpyruvate, decreased concentration fructose bisphosphate required give half-maximal activity (K0.5). NaCl increased K0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate fructose bisphosphate, leaving Vmax unchanged. results consistent ionic binding fructose bisphosphate phosphates critical role hydrogen bonds stabilizing inactive active enzyme conformers.
