 Mitochondria bovine hearts fractionated three different procedures fractions characterized marker enzymes. Highly purified outer membranes, membrane vesicles, inner membranes, well two high-speed soluble fractions, obtained. Azide (or oligomycin) resistant ATPase found marker outer membranes. data consistent association protein kinase activity soluble matrix mitochondria. Activity highest histone H2B substrate, histone H1 next preference. contrast mitochondrial protein kinases studied previously, protamine, casein, phosvitin poor substrates detectable phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase. Activity stimulated cAMP cGMP, calmodulin, phosphatidylserine--diolein, without Ca2+. Two cAMP-dependent isozymes separated soluble fraction mitochondria chromatography DE-52 columns. Phosphorylation histone H2B isozymes inhibited 98% Kemptide.
