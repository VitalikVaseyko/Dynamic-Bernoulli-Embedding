 astringency Chinese pollination-constant non-astringent (C-PCNA) persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) naturally removed tree. process controlled single locus dominant types persimmons; therefore, variant important candidate commercial cultivation breeding PCNA cultivars. previous study, six full-length coding sequences (CDS) pyruvate kinase genes (DkPK1-6) isolated, DkPK1 thought involved natural deastringency C-PCNA persimmon fruit. Here, characterize eight DkPK genes (DkPK7-14) C-PCNA persimmon fruit based transcriptome data. transcript changes DkPK7-14 genes correlations proanthocyanidin (PA) content investigated different fruit development stages C-PCNA, J-PCNA, non-PCNA persimmon; DkPK7 DkPK8 exhibited up-regulation patterns last developmental stage C-PCNA persimmon negatively correlated decrease soluble PAs. Phylogenetic analysis subcellular localization analysis revealed DkPK7 DkPK8 cytosolic proteins. Notably, DkPK7 DkPK8 ubiquitously expressed various persimmon organs abundantly up-regulated seeds. Furthermore, transient over-expression DkPK7 DkPK8 persimmon leaves led significant decrease content soluble PAs significant increase expression levels pyruvate decarboxylase (DkPDC) alcohol dehydrogenase genes (DkADH), closely related acetaldehyde metabolism. accumulated acetaldehyde results up-regulation DkPDC DkADH genes combine soluble PAs form insoluble PAs, resulting removal astringency persimmon fruit. Thus, suggest DkPK7 DkPK8 likely involved natural deastringency via up-regulation DkPDC DkADH expression last developmental stage C-PCNA persimmon.
