 BACKGROUND: Airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) play important physiological roles lung, abnormal proliferation directly contributes airway remodeling development lung diseases asthma. MicroRNAs small yet versatile gene tuners regulate variety cellular processes, including cell growth proliferation, little known precise role microRNAs proliferation ASMCs. METHODS: study, human ASMCs asthmatic non-asthmatic donors used. MicroRNA mRNA expression measured quantitative real-time PCR. Dual-luciferase reporter assays performed determine whether microRNA-138 (miR-138) binds directly 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1(PDK1) 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) alter gene expression. RESULTS: results showed overexpression miR-138 reduced proliferation human ASMCs, whereas inhibition miR-138 increased proliferation ASMCs. MiR-138 directly suppressed PDK1 expression targeting 3'-UTR gene. MiR-138 controls ASMC proliferation directly inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. CONCLUSIONS: study indicated miR-138 regulation PI3K signaling ASMCs altering expression PDK1 profound impact cell proliferation.
