 INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) reported inhibit myocardial hypertrophy cell model cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. previous study also shows H2S-induced increase glucose metabolism insulin-targeting cells. present study aims examine hypothesis H2S attenuates myocardial hypertrophy promotes glucose utilization cardiomyocytes. METHODS: cell model cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced application phenylephrine cardiomyocyte hypertrophy examined using leucine incorporation assay. Protein levels measured using Western blot analysis. activity related enzymes measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: NaHS (an H2S donor) treatment increased activity cultured cardiomyocytes reduced hypertrophy cultured cardiomyocytes concentrations ranging 25 200 micromol/L. NaHS treatment increased glucose uptake efficiency glycolysis citric acid cycle. key enzymes reactions, including lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase succinate dehydrogenase, activated NaHS treatment (100 micromol/L). intermediates glycolysis citric acid cycle, including lactic acid, cyclohexylammonium, oxaloacetic acid, succinate, L-dimalate, sodium citrate, cis-aconitic acid, ketoglutarate DL-isocitric acid trisodium also showed anti-hypertrophic effects cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: H2S improves glucose utilization inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
