 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) recently suggested regulate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity thus pyruvate entry mitochondrion. aimed provide evidence direct link AMPK PDH resting metabolically challenged (exercised) skeletal muscle. Compared rest, treadmill running increased AMPKalpha1 activity alpha(2)KO mice (90%, P < 0.01) increased AMPKalpha2 activity wild-type (WT) mice (110%, P < 0.05), leading increased AMPKalpha Thr(172) (WT: 40%, alpha(2)KO: 100%, P < 0.01) ACCbeta Ser(227) phosphorylation (WT: 70%, alpha(2)KO: 210%, P < 0.01). Compared rest, exercise significantly induced PDH-E(1)alpha site 1 (WT: 20%, alpha(2)KO: 62%, P < 0.01) site 2 (only alpha(2)KO: 83%, P < 0.01) dephosphorylation PDH(a) [ approximately 200% genotypes (P < 0.01)]. Compared WT, PDH dephosphorylation activation markedly enhanced alpha(2)KO mice rest exercise. increased PDH(a) activity exercise associated elevated glycolytic flux, muscles alpha(2)KO mice displayed marked lactate accumulation deranged energy homeostasis. Whereas mitochondrial DNA content normal, expression several mitochondrial proteins significantly decreased muscle alpha(2)KO mice. isolated resting EDL muscles, activation AMPK signaling AICAR change PDH-E(1)alpha phosphorylation either genotype. PDH activated mouse skeletal muscle response exercise independent AMPKalpha2 expression. exercise, alpha(2)KO muscles display deranged energy homeostasis despite enhanced glycolytic flux PDH(a) activity. may linked decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity.
