 Multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer significant clinical obstacle often implicated cases recurrent, nonresponsive disease. Targeted nanoparticles made synthesizing poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)/poly(ethylene glycol)/epidermal growth factor receptor targeting peptide (PLGA/PEG/EGFR-peptide) construct incorporation poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles. MDR induced panel nine human breast ovarian cancer cell lines using hypoxia. EGFR-targeted polymer blend nanoparticles shown actively target EGFR overexpressing cell lines, especially upon induction hypoxia. nanoparticles capable sustained drug release. Combination therapy lonidamine paclitaxel significantly improved therapeutic index drugs. Treatment nanoparticle dose 1 muM paclitaxel/10 muM lonidamine resulted less 10% cell viability hypoxic/MDR cell lines less 5% cell viability normoxic cell lines. Comparatively, treatment 1 muM paclitaxel alone approximate IC(5)(0) value MDR cells treatment lonidamine alone little effect. PLGA/PEG/EGFR-peptide delivery system actively targets MDR cell exploiting expression EGFR. system treats MDR inhibiting Warburg effect promoting mitochondrial binding pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (lonidamine), hyperstabilizing microtubules (paclitaxel). nanocarrier system actively targets MDR associated phenotype (EGFR receptor overexpression), enhancing therapeutic index drugs potentiating use lonidamine/paclitaxel combination therapy treatment MDR cancer.
