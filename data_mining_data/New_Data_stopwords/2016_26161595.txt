 AIM: aim study compare effect resveratrol gliclazide losartan streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. MATERIALS METHODS: Adult male Wistar albino rats divided five groups seven rats each. Diabetes induced single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). Rats blood glucose levels 250 mg/dl 48 h streptozotocin injection included diabetic group. Gliclazide resveratrol administered 3 weeks 5 mg/kg per day losartan administered 3 weeks 30 mg/kg per day oral aqueous suspension. end third week rats euthanized fasting blood glucose, HbA1c metabolic activity hepatic enzymes hexokinase glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase measured tail blood liver specimens. parameters quantified using ELISA plate reader. RESULTS: Resveratrol gliclazide significantly reduced blood glucose levels HbA1c levels diabetic rats (p < 0.001). However, losartan exhibit effects (p < 0.05). enzymatic activity liver enzymes hexokinase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose 1,6-biphosphatase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6 phosphatase enhanced resveratrol gliclazide, losartan treatment associated significant changes liver carbohydrate metabolism. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol effective improving liver carbohydrate metabolism relative gliclazide, drug widely used treat diabetes. Dose-response profile resveratrol remains indeterminate additional studies may necessary determine effective dosing diabetes.
