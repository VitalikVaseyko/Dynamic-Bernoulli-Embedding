 Cancer cell metabolic reprogramming includes shift energy production oxidative phosphorylation less efficient glycolysis even presence oxygen (Warburg effect) use glutamine increased biosynthetic needs. necessitates greatly increased glucose glutamine uptake, enter hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). HBP end product UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) used enzymatic post-translational modification many cytosolic nuclear proteins O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Here, observed increased HBP flux hyper-O-GlcNAcylation human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC hyper-O-GlcNAcylation associated elevation OGT reduction enzyme removes O-GlcNAc (OGA). Reducing hyper-O-GlcNAcylation effect non-transformed pancreatic epithelial cell growth, inhibited PDAC cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, orthotopic tumor growth, triggered apoptosis. PDAC supported oncogenic NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. NF-kappaB p65 subunit upstream kinases IKKalpha/IKKbeta O-GlcNAcylated PDAC. Reducing hyper-O-GlcNAcylation decreased PDAC cell p65 activating phosphorylation (S536), nuclear translocation, NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, target gene expression. Conversely, mimicking PDAC hyper-O-GlcNAcylation pharmacological inhibition OGA suppressed suspension culture-induced apoptosis increased IKKalpha p65 O-GlcNAcylation, accompanied activation NF-kappaB signaling. Finally, reducing p65 O-GlcNAcylation specifically mutating two p65 O-GlcNAc sites (T322A T352A) attenuated induction PDAC cell anchorage-independent growth. data indicate hyper-O-GlcNAcylation anti-apoptotic contributes NF-kappaB oncogenic activation PDAC.
