 Although oncogenetics remains critical component cancer biology therapeutic research, recent interest taken towards non-genetic features tumour development progression, cancer metabolism. Specifically, observed tumour cells inclined preferentially undergo glycolysis despite presence adequate oxygen. First reported Otto Warburg 1920s, termed 'Warburg effect', aberrant metabolism become particular interest due prevalence fermentation phenotype variety cancers studied. Consequently, phenotype proven play pivotal role cancer proliferation. Warburg's observations integrated within modern paradigms cancer review explore role lactate insidious metabolite due Warburg effect.
