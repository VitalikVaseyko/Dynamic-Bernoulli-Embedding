 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) one leading cause cancer death world. Fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (FBP1), rate-limiting enzyme gluconeogenesis, identified recently tumor suppressor HCC cancer types. study, demonstrated tripartite motif-containing protein 28 (TRIM28) binds directly promotes FBP1 ubiquitination degradation. MAGE-A3 MAGE-C2, known overexpressed HCC, enhance TRIM28-dependent degradation FBP1 forming ubiquitin ligase complexes TRIM28. showed expression TRIM28 increased glucose consumption lactate production promoting FBP1 degradation HCC cells FBP1 key mediator TRIM28-induced HCC growth culture mice. Moreover, demonstrated FBP1 TRIM28 protein levels inversely correlated HCC patient specimens. Finally, showed proteasome inhibitor bortezomib mitigated Warburg effect inhibiting FBP1 degradation HCC. Collectively, findings identify oncogenic MAGE-TRIM28 complex-mediated proteasome degradation FBP1 key mechanism underlying downregulation FBP1 proteins HCC, also reveal MAGE-TRIM28-regulated reprogramming cancer cell metabolism HCC tumorigenesis mediated, least part, FBP1 degradation.
