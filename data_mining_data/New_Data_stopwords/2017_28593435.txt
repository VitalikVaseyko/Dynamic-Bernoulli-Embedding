 Hypoxanthine major purine involved salvage pathway purines brain. High levels hypoxanthine characteristic Lesch-Nyhan Disease. Since hypoxanthine purine closely related ATP formation, aim study investigate effect intrastriatal hypoxanthine administration neuroenergetic parameters (pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase, complex II, cytochrome c oxidase, ATP levels) mitochondrial function (mitochondrial mass membrane potential) striatum rats. also evaluated effect cell death parameters (necrosis apoptosis). Wistar rats 60 days life underwent stereotactic surgery divided two groups: control (infusion saline 0.9%) hypoxanthine (10 muM). Intrastriatal hypoxanthine administration alter pyruvate kinase activity, increased succinate dehydrogenase complex II activities diminished cytochrome c oxidase activity immunocontent. Hypoxanthine injection decreased percentage cells mitochondrial membrane label increased mitochondrial membrane potential labeling. decrease number live cells increase number apoptotic cells caused hypoxanthine. findings show intrastriatal hypoxanthine administration altered neuroenergetic parameters, caused mitochondrial dysfunction cell death apoptosis, suggesting processes may associated, least part, neurological symptoms found patients Lesch-Nyhan Disease.
