 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2) activity stimulated NADH NADH plus acetyl-CoA via reduction reductive acetylation lipoyl groups dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component. Elevated K(+) Cl(-) needed significant stimulation. Stimulation substantially increased k(cat) K(m) ATP; fractional stimulation increased level ATP. E2 structure lacking pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) binding domain, stimulation PDK2 retained, K(m) E1 decreased, equilibrium dissociation constant ATP increased remained much lower K(m) ATP. Stimulation PDK2 activity greatly reduced fraction bound ADP. results fit ordered reaction mechanism ATP binding E1 stimulation increasing rate dissociation ADP. Conversion lipoyl groups E2 60mer oxidized form (E2(ox)) greatly reduced k(cat) K(m) PDK2 ATP. Retention extended period time low portion reduced lipoyl groups maintains E2 state supported much higher PDK2 activity short-term (5 min) reduction large portion lipoyl groups E2(ox), reduction E2(ox) produced larger fold stimulation. Reduction greater extent reductive acetylation increased PDK2 binding E2; conversion E2(ox) significantly hinder binding. suggest passing even limited reducing equivalents among lipoyl groups maintains E2 lipoyl domains conformation aids kinase function.
