 intravenous (but oral) application ascorbate, millimolar serum concentrations reached, preferentially cytotoxic cancer cells. Cytotoxicity mediated transition metal-dependent generation H(2)O(2) interstitial space. study, sensitivity neuroblastoma cells (Kelly, SK-N-SH) ascorbate H(2)O(2) defense mechanisms H(2)O(2) investigated. Since aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) feature many tumour cells, glucose consumption lactate production monitored. Furthermore, synthesis release ferritin neuroblastoma cells analysed order examine whether ferritin possibly iron source H(2)O(2) generation. Ascorbate (0.6-5.0 mM) H(2)O(2) (25-100 muM) found similarly cytotoxic Kelly SK-N-SH cells. case, cytotoxicity increased cell concentrations decreased, accordance low cell concentrations lower capacities detoxify H(2)O(2). Kelly SK-N-SH cells produced released remarkable amounts lactate ferritin. propose selective cytotoxicity high dose ascorbate tumour cells due preferential generation H(2)O(2) acidic ferritin-rich tumour microenvironment, combined reduced defense systems H(2)O(2) consequence aerobic glycolysis.
