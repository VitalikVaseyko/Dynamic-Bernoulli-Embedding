 majority cancer cells maintain high glycolytic activity increased lactate production, even well oxygenated environment. phenomenon known Warburg effect. Previous studies revealed various types cancer selectively express pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), PKM2 plays pivotal role Warburg effect. Although elevated PKM2 levels observed pancreatic cancer types cancer, little known biological function PKM2. study, order examine expression role PKM2 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), knocked PKM2 PDAC cells introducing small interfering short hairpin RNAs, examined gene expression profiles cells microarray analysis. analyzed energy-producing pathways cells XFe Extracellular Flux Analyzers, detected intracellular metabolites capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry. found RNAi-mediated knockdown PKM2 diminished proliferative, migratory tumorigenic ability PDAC cell-lines. PKM2 knockdown also resulted lower glycolytic activities decreased levels intracellular metabolites, pyruvate polyamine; however, led elevated levels reactive oxygen species. Microarray analysis revealed functional association PKM2 expression genes drive cell cycle. whole, findings study demonstrate PKM2 plays important role metabolic activities, well malignancy PDAC cells.
