 Acute myeloid leukemia adults highly heterogeneous disease. Gene expression profiling performed using unsupervised algorithms used distinguish specific groups patients within large patient cohort. identified gene expression signatures offer insights underlying physiological mechanisms disease pathogenesis. Here, analysis several related gene expression clusters associated poor outcome, worst overall survival highest rates resistant disease obtained patients time diagnosis previously untreated individuals presented. Surprisingly, gene clusters appear enriched genes corresponding proteins involved transport across membranes (transporters, carriers channels). Several ideas describing possible relationship membrane transport activity leukemic cell biology, including "Warburg effect," specific role chloride ion transport, direct "import" metabolic energy uptake creatine phosphate, modification bone marrow niche microenvironment discussed.
