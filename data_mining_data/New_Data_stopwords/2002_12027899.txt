 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) primary regulator flux mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Analysis primary amino-acid sequences PDK various sources reveals enzymes include five domains characteristic prokaryotic two-component His-kinases, despite fact PDK exclusively phosphorylates Ser residues E1alpha subunit PDC. seeming contradiction might resolved PDK-catalyzed reaction employed phospho-His intermediate. results pH-stability studies autophosphorylated Arabidopsis thaliana PDK provide support phospho-His intermediate. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis two likely phosphotransfer residues (H121 H168) abolish either PDK autophosphorylation ability transphosphorylate E1alpha. Thus, PDK unique type protein kinase His-kinase-like sequence Ser-kinase activity.
