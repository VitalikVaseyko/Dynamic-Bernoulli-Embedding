 key characteristic cancer cells ability switch predominantly oxidative metabolism glycolysis production lactate even oxygen plentiful. metabolic switch, known Warburg effect, first described 1920s, fascinated puzzled researchers ever since. However, dramatic increase glycolysis presence oxygen one hallmarks development early mammalian embryo; metabolic switch many parallels Warburg effect cancers. present review provides brief overview similarities metabolism tumours early embryos proposes whether knowledge early embryo metabolism help us understand metabolic regulation cancer cells.
