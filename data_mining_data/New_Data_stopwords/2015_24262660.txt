 Cancer metabolism extensively investigated various tools, fact diverse metabolic reprogramming cancer cells gradually unveiled. review, discuss contributions cancer metabolism general proteomic analysis post-translational modification analysis using mass spectrometry (MS) technique. Instead following one several metabolic enzymes/pathways, current MS approach quickly identify large number proteins compare expression levels different samples, providing potentially comprehensive picture cancer metabolism. MS analyses pancreatic cancer cells support hypothesis hypoxia promotes cells solid tumor reprogram metabolic pathways order minimize oxygen consumption. oxidative stress pancreatic cancer cells lower normal duct cells, cancer cells adaptively express less antioxidant proteins, contrary claims oxidative stress higher cancer cells. Separately, MS analyses confirm pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2) detected cancer normal cells, disagreeing report tumor cells express exclusively PKM2. addition, MS analyses pancreatic cancer cells demonstrate lactate dehydrogenase-B significantly upregulated pancreatic cancer cells, whereas previous reports show lactate dehydrogenase-A overexpressed responsible lactate production cancer cells. Lastly, result MS analysis suggests glutaminolysis pancreatic cancer cells different observed glioblastoma cells.
