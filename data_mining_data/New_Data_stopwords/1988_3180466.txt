 method estimation arginine 50 microliters serum developed using commercially available arginine kinase (EC 2.7.3.3). assay based transformation arginine ATP phospho-arginine ADP enzyme. ADP measured two coupling reactions involving pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) measurement NADH consumption 340 nm. method involves preincubation serum reaction medium without arginine kinase eliminate side reactions kinetic rate protocol measurements absorbance 60 180 s. Reaction temperature 30 degrees C. reaction linear least 3 mmol/l arginine. Within-batch CV less 3% arginine levels 0.75 mmol/l between-batch CV 6.5% less. method correlates well automatic amino acid analyzer procedure (r = 0.983). reference range derived sera 40 blood donors determined 0.06-0.20 mmol/l.
