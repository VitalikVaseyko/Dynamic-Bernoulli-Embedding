 Disassembly nucleosomes genomic DNA packaged histone regulates gene expression. However, mechanisms underlying nucleosome disassembly gene expression remain elusive. show epidermal growth factor receptor activation results binding RNF8 forkhead-associated domain pyruvate kinase M2-phosphorylated histone H3-T11, leading K48-linked polyubiquitylation histone H3 K4 subsequent proteasome-dependent protein degradation. addition, H3 polyubiquitylation induces histone dissociation chromatin, nucleosome disassembly, binding RNA polymerase II MYC CCND1 promoter regions transcription. RNF8-mediated histone H3 polyubiquitylation promotes tumor cell glycolysis proliferation brain tumorigenesis. findings uncover role RNF8-mediated histone H3 polyubiquitylation regulation histone H3 stability chromatin modification, paving way gene expression regulation tumorigenesis.
