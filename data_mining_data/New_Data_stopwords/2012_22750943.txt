 Unlike healthy adult tissues, cancers produce energy mainly aerobic glycolysis instead oxidative phosphorylation. adaptation, called Warburg effect, may feature dividing cells, normal cancerous, may specific cancers. known whether, normally growing tissue development, proliferating postmitotic cells produce energy fundamentally different ways. show embryonic Xenopus retina vivo, dividing progenitor cells depend less oxidative phosphorylation ATP production non-dividing differentiated cells, instead use glycogen fuel aerobic glycolysis. transition glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation connected cell differentiation process. Glycolysis indispensable progenitor proliferation biosynthesis, even used ATP production. results suggest Warburg effect feature normal proliferation vivo, regulation glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation critical normal development.
