 terrestrial anuran Rana sylvatica tolerates extended periods whole-body freezing winter. Freezing survival facilitated extensive glycogen hydrolysis distribution high concentrations cryoprotectant glucose blood tissues. glycogenesis energy-expensive process counter-productive maintaining sustained high cryoprotectant levels, proposed glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) would activated wood frogs froze would phosphorylate downstream substrates inactivate glycogen synthesis. Western blot analysis determined amount phosphorylated (inactive) GSK-3 decreased five tissues tested 24 h frozen frogs compared unfrozen controls. Total GSK-3 protein levels change, exception heart GSK-3, indicating post-translational modification primary regulatory mechanism kinase. Kinetic properties skeletal muscle GSK-3 control frozen frogs displayed differential responses temperature change (22 versus 4 degrees C) high glucose. example, assayed 4 degrees C, K(m) GSK-3 substrate peptide approximately 44% lower frozen frogs corresponding value control frogs, indicating greater GSK-3 affinity substrates frozen state. indicates temperatures similar environment encountered frogs, GSK-3 frozen frogs phosphorylate downstream targets readily unfrozen controls. GSK-3 skeletal muscle control frogs also allosterically regulated. AMP phosphoenolpyruvate activated GSK-3 whereas inhibitors included glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, ATP, glutamate, glutamine, glycerol, NH(4)Cl, NaCl KCl. combination phosphorylation allosteric control argues regulatory role GSK-3 inactivating glycogenesis preserve high glucose cryoprotectant levels throughout freezing bout.
