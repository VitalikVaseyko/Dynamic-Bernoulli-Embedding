 Six sublines K562 erythroleukaemic cell line examined starch gel electrophoresis red cell enzymes carbonic anhydrase, CA II, pyruvate kinase, PK1 (R), lactic dehydrogenase, LDH (B), uninduced following induction haemoglobin synthesis sodium butyrate haemin. Neither CA PK1 (R) enzymes present constitutively found inducible characteristics; LDH isoenzyme pattern showed equal expression B subunits change red cell form (B greater A) induction. Subline heterogeneity also examined analysis 11 polymorphic enzymes, cell line contamination found account previously reported variations inducibility sodium butyrate.
