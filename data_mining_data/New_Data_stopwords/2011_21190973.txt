 CONTEXT: lean individuals, increasing dietary lipid elicit increase whole body lipid oxidation; however, obesity capacity respond changes substrate availability appears compromised. OBJECTIVE: determine whether responses genes regulating lipid oxidation skeletal muscle differed lean insulin resistant obese humans upon exposure high-fat diet (HFD). DESIGN SETTING: 5-d prospective study conducted research unit academic center. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy, lean (n = 12; body mass index = 22.1 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)), obese (n=10; body mass index = 39.6 +/- 1.7 kg/m(2)) males females, ages 18 30. INTERVENTION: Participants studied 5-d HFD (65% fat). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Skeletal muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) obtained fasted fed states HFD mRNA content genes involved lipid oxidation determined. Skeletal muscle acylcarnitine content determined fed states HFD. RESULTS: Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) alpha mRNA content increased lean, obese, subjects single high-fat meal. Pre- Post-HFD, mRNA content exhibited body size x HFD interaction, lean individuals increased obese individuals decreased mRNA content pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, uncoupling protein 3, PPARalpha, PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (P </= 0.05). obese subjects medium-chain acylcarnitine species tended accumulate, whereas change reduction evident lean individuals. CONCLUSIONS: findings indicate differential response lipid stimulus skeletal muscle lean insulin resistant obese humans.
