 Cancers acquire mutations cooperating pathways sustain growth survival. support continued proliferation, tumor cells adapt metabolism balance energy production augmented biosynthetic needs. Although normal differentiated cells use mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) bioenergetic source, cancer cells proposed rely principally cytoplasmic glycolysis. molecular basis shift, termed Warburg effect, subject intense investigation, mechanistic understanding may lead novel approaches target altered metabolism cancer cells. Recently, mutations BRAF(V600E) emerged major regulator metabolic homeostasis. Melanoma cells may use metabolic shift circumvent BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence though limiting reliance OXPHOS promote proliferation. Furthermore, BRAF(V600E) acts suppress expression melanocyte master regulator microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) mitochondrial biogenesis coactivator PGC1alpha. Accordingly, therapeutic inhibition BRAF(V600E) reverses metabolic reprogramming melanoma cells elevates OXPHOS increased MITF-PGC1alpha levels. BRAF-targeted drugs modulate metabolic state malignant melanoma cells, counteracting adaptive responses using pharmacologic agents may prove useful combinatorial therapeutic strategies.
