 Whereas moderately increased cellular oxidative stress supportive cancerous growth cells, excessive levels reactive oxygen species (ROS) detrimental growth survival. demonstrated high ROS levels, via increased oxidized glutathione (GSSG), induce isoform-specific S-glutathionylation 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) residue Cys206, located near entrance 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase catalytic pocket. Upon ROS-dependent, reversible, covalent modification, marked decrease catalytic ability synthesize fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P(2)), key glycolysis allosteric activator, observed. event coupled decrease glycolytic flux increase glucose metabolic flux pentose phosphate pathway. shift, turn, caused increase reduced glutathione (GSH) and, ultimately, resulted ROS detoxification inside HeLa cells. ability PFKFB3 control Fru-2,6-P(2) levels ROS-dependent manner allows PFKFB3-expressing cancer cells continue energy metabolism reduced risk excessive oxidative stress and, thereby, support cell survival proliferation. study provides new insight roles PFKFB3 switch senses controls redox homeostasis cancer addition role cancer glycolysis.
