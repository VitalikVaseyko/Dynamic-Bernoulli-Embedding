 AIMS: Antenatal glucocorticoid therapy shown prevent acute diseases including infant respiratory distress syndrome reduce mortality, although little known effects cardiac function-related proteins fetus neonate. investigated whether cardiac function-related proteins altered cardiac tissues fetuses neonates born pregnant rats treated glucocorticoid. MAIN METHODS: Dexamethasone (DEX) administered pregnant rats 2 days day 17 18 day 19 20 gestation simulate antenatal DEX therapy, cardiac tissues 19- 21-day fetuses 1-, 3-, 5-day neonates analyzed using proteomic technique liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. KEY FINDINGS: identified five proteins; alpha-enolase, creatine kinase-M type, beta-tubulin, troponin T, ATP synthase beta-chain, significantly increased fetal cardiac tissues DEX administration. observed significant increase alpha-enolase 19-day fetuses DEX using Western blotting immunohistochemistry. ATP cAMP levels also increased fetal heart tissue. addition, pyruvate levels significantly increased fetus groups DEX. SIGNIFICANCE: results suggest increased alpha-enolase may contribute acceleration glycolysis preterm heart.
