 effects diabetes heart function may initiated compounded exaggerated reliance diabetic heart fatty acids ketones metabolic fuels. beta-Blocking agents metoprolol proposed inhibit fatty acid oxidation. hypothesized metoprolol would improve cardiac function inhibiting fatty acid oxidation promoting compensatory increase glucose utilization. measured ex vivo cardiac function substrate utilization chronic metoprolol treatment acute metoprolol perfusion. Chronic metoprolol treatment attenuated development cardiac dysfunction streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. chronic treatment metoprolol, palmitate oxidation increased control hearts decreased diabetic hearts without affecting myocardial energetics. Acute treatment metoprolol heart perfusions led reduced rates palmitate oxidation, stimulation glucose oxidation, increased tissue ATP levels. Metoprolol lowered malonyl-CoA levels control hearts only, changes acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase activity observed. acute metoprolol perfusion chronic vivo metoprolol treatment led decreased maximum activity decreased sensitivity carnitine palmitoyltransferase malonyl-CoA. Metoprolol also increased sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase expression prevented reexpression atrial natriuretic peptide diabetic hearts. data demonstrate metoprolol ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy inhibits fatty acid oxidation streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Since malonyl-CoA levels increased, reduction total carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity likely factor explain decrease fatty acid oxidation. metabolism changes occur parallel changes gene expression.
