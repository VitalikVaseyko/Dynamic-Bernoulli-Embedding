 Cardiac metabolic inflexibility driven robust up-regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) phosphorylation-dependent inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) within single day feeding mice high fat diet. current study, discovered PDK4 short lived protein (t(1/2) approximately 1 h) specifically degraded mitochondrial protease Lon. Lon rapidly degrade PDK1 -2, indicating specificity toward PDK isoform potent modulator metabolic flexibility. Moreover, PDK4 degradation appears regulated dissociation PDH complex dependent respiratory state energetic substrate availability mouse heart mitochondria. Finally, demonstrate pharmacologic inhibition PDK4 promotes PDK4 degradation vitro vivo findings reveal novel strategy manipulate PDH activity selectively targeting PDK4 content dissociation proteolysis.
