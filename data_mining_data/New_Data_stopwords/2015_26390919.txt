 Fragile site FRA16D exhibits DNA instability cancer, resulting diminished levels protein WWOX gene spans it. WWOX suppresses tumor growth undefined mechanism. WWOX participates pathways involving aerobic metabolism reactive oxygen species. WWOX comprises two WW domains well short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzyme. Herein described vivo genetic analysis Drosophila melanogaster identify functional interactions WWOX metabolic pathways. Altered WWOX levels modulate variable cellular outgrowths caused genetic deficiencies components mitochondrial respiratory complexes. modulation requires enzyme active site WWOX, defective respiratory complex-induced cellular outgrowths mediated reactive oxygen species, dependent upon Akt pathway sensitive levels autophagy hypoxia-inducible factor. WWOX known contribute homeostasis regulating balance oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis. Reduction WWOX levels results diminished ability respond metabolic perturbation normal cell growth. Thus, ability WWOX facilitate escape mitochondrial damage-induced glycolysis (Warburg effect) is, therefore, plausible mechanism tumor suppressor activity.
