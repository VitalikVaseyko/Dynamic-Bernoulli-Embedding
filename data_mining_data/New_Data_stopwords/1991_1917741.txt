 chronically active (pseudomyotonic) gastrocnemius muscle C57B16J dy2J/dy2J mouse contains elevated lactate glycogen well fibers high amounts glycogen enhanced glyconeogenic activity. present study analyze activities key glyconeogenic enzymes assess causes elevated muscle glycogen determine pathway glycogen synthesis lactate. Glycogen synthase, malate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malic enzyme elevated homogenates chronically active muscle. Activities glycogen phosphorylase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase decreased whole muscle homogenates. Histochemistry demonstrated high-glycogen fibers typically fast-twitch glycolytic fibers high glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, malic enzyme activities. Malate dehydrogenase activity followed succinate dehydrogenase activity correlate high-glycogen fibers. Thus high-glycogen fibers elevated enzymatic capacity glycogen synthesis lactate, pathway may involve use pyruvate kinase bypass enzymes.
