 Autophagy self-degradative physiological process cell removes worn-out damaged components. Constant basal level may become highly active response cellular stress. type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), accumulates stressful cell conditions, plays important role regulation autophagy cells lacking enzyme display impaired autophagy/mitophagy consequent shift metabolism glycolysis. define molecular partners TG2 involved cellular processes, analysed TG2 interactome normal starved conditions discovering TG2 interacts various proteins belonging different functional categories. Herein show TG2 interacts pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), rate limiting enzyme glycolysis responsible maintaining glycolytic phenotype malignant cells displays non metabolic functions, including transcriptional co-activation protein kinase activity. Interestingly, ablation PKM2 led decrease intracellular TG2's transamidating activity paralleled increase tyrosine phosphorylation. Along this, significant decrease ULK1 Beclin1 also recorded, thus suggesting block upstream regulation autophagosome formation. data suggest PKM2/TG2 interplay plays important role regulation autophagy particular cellular stressful conditions displayed cancer cells.
