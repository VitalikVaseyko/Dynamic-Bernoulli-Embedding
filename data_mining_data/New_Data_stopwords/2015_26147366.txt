 Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expressed antigen-presenting cells exerts immunosuppressive effects CD4(+) cells. One mechanism inhibition aerobic glycolysis. Another prerequisite T-cell proliferation differentiation effector cells increased fatty acid (FA) synthesis. effect IDO enzymes involved FA synthesis evaluated primary human cells mixed lymphocyte reactions presence IDO inhibitor 1-dl-methyl-tryptophan, stimulated CD4(+) cells presence general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase activator tryptophanol (TRP). IDO TRP inhibited cell proliferation. assessing level GCN2 kinase mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 substrates along kynurenine free system showed IDO exerts effect mainly activation GCN2 kinase. IDO TRP down-regulated ATP-citrate lyase acetyl coenzyme carboxylase 1, key enzymes involved FA synthesis. Also, IDO TRP altered expression enzymes control availability carbon atoms FA synthesis, lactate dehydrogenase-A, pyruvate dehydrogenase, glutaminase 1 glutaminase 2, way inhibits FA synthesis. conclusion, IDO GCN2 kinase activation inhibits CD4(+) T-cell proliferation down-regulates key enzymes directly indirectly promote FA synthesis, prerequisite CD4(+) T-cell proliferation differentiation effector cell lineages.
