 six different vitamin B(6) (VB(6)) forms, pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP). PLP coenzyme required 100 cellular enzymes. spite importance vitamin, understanding VB(6) metabolic conversion plants limited. study, developed sensitive reliable method assay VB(6)-metabolizing enzyme activities monitoring products visually using high-performance liquid chromatography. method, reactions catalyzed PL/PM/PN kinase, PMP/PNP oxidase, PM-pyruvate aminotransferase, PL reductase PLP phosphatase nicely detected using crude protein extracts tobacco leaves. optimal vitro conditions, specific activities enzymes 0.15 +/- 0.03, 0.10 +/- 0.03, 0.08 +/- 0.02, 0.64 +/- 0.13 23.08 +/- 1.98 nmol product/min/mg protein, respectively. first report conversion PM PL catalyzed PM-pyruvate aminotransferase plants. Furthermore, PL reductase activity found heat inducible. study sheds light VB(6) metabolism taking place plants.
