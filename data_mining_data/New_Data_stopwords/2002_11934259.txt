 Although conversion lactate glycogen (glyconeogenesis) muscle demonstrated long time ago, biochemical reactions responsible process still controversial matter. present study, advantage taken specific inhibition induced phenylalanine muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) investigate role reverse PK activity muscle glyconeogenesis. Addition phenylalanine incubation medium preparation isolated, intact skeletal muscles maintain metabolic activity several hours reduced 50% rate incorporation [14C]lactate [14C]bicarbonate muscle glycogen. Muscle extracts presented high levels maximal activity PK reverse direction, completely blocked presence phenylalanine. contrast, mercaptopicolinic acid, inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), affect incorporation 14C either lactate bicarbonate muscle glycogen. Maximal PEPCK activity much lower muscle extracts gluconeogenic glyceroneogenic tissues suppressed presence mercaptopicolinic acid. data suggest reversal metabolic flux reaction catalyzed PK contributes accumulation lactate-derived glycogen occurs skeletal muscle certain physiological conditions.
