 Aberrant glucose metabolism, "aerobic glycolysis" "Warburg effect", hallmark human cancers. cluster "multifaceted regulators", plays pivotal role regulation glucose metabolism. modulate activities specific enzymes, also act transcriptional activators regulate expression metabolism related genes. Additionally, crosstalk key factors involved glucose metabolism work together initiate multiple oncogenic processes. "multifaceted regulators", especially p53, HIF-1, TIGAR microRNA, focused review. comprehensively illustrate regulatory effects cancer glucose metabolism, elaborate clinical significance. In-depth elucidation role "multifaceted regulators" cancer glucose metabolism provide us novel insights cancer research field offer promising therapeutic targets anti-cancer therapies.
