 meiotic division oocytes arrested G2 phase cell cycle. Resumption meiosis, also known oocyte maturation, entails G2 transition. G2-M boundary, maturation promoting factor (MPF) activation usually induced via several ways, including tyrosine dephosphorylation p34(cdc2) synthesis cyclin B according cell type species. Previous studies laboratory demonstrated glucocorticoids directly inhibit meiotic maturation pig oocytes vitro. aim study therefore investigate influence glucocorticoids expression p34(cdc2) cyclin B1 resumption meiosis pig oocytes. detected relative levels association p34(cdc2) cyclin B1. Isolated cumulus-enclosed oocytes cultured Waymouth MB752/1 medium supplemented sodium pyruvate (50 microgram/ml), LH (0.5 microgram/ml), FSH (0.5 microgram/ml), estradiol-17beta (1 microgram/ml) presence absence dexamethasone (DEX) 24 hr; cultured without hormonal supplements presence absence DEX additional 24 hr. found cyclin B1, well p34(cdc2), already present fully grown G2-arrested pig oocytes removed follicle. oocytes, cyclin B1 p34(cdc2) already associated complex. Treatment DEX concentrations 1 microgram/ml decreased level cyclin B1, effect level p34(cdc2). exposure oocytes DEX also decreased amount complexed p34(cdc2)-cyclin B1. findings suggest inhibitory action DEX meiotic maturation could due, least part, reduced amount p34(cdc2)-cyclin B1 complex.
