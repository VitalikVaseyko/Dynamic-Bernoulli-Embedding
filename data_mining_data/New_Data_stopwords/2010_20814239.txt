 Loss stromal fibroblast caveolin-1 (Cav-1) powerful single independent predictor poor prognosis human breast cancer patients, associated early tumor recurrence, lymph node metastasis tamoxifen-resistance. developed novel co-culture system understand mechanism(s) loss stromal fibroblast Cav-1 induces "lethal tumor micro-environment." Here, propose new paradigm explain powerful prognostic value stromal Cav-1. model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress cancer-associated fibroblasts, acts "metabolic" "mutagenic" motor drive tumor-stroma co-evolution, DNA damage aneuploidy cancer cells. specifically, show acute loss Cav-1 expression leads mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress aerobic glycolysis cancer associated fibroblasts. Also, propose defective mitochondria removed cancer-associated fibroblasts autophagy/mitophagy induced oxidative stress. consequence, cancer associated fibroblasts provide nutrients (such lactate) stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis oxidative metabolism adjacent cancer cells (the "Reverse Warburg Effect"). provide evidence oxidative stress cancer-associated fibroblasts sufficient induce genomic instability adjacent cancer cells, via bystander effect, potentially increasing aggressive behavior. Finally, directly demonstrate nitric oxide (NO) over-production, secondary Cav-1 loss, root cause mitochondrial dysfunction cancer associated fibroblasts. support notion, treatment anti-oxidants (such N-acetyl-cysteine, metformin quercetin) inhibitors (L-NAME) sufficient reverse many cancer-associated fibroblast phenotypes describe. Thus, cancer cells use "oxidative stress" adjacent fibroblasts (i) "engine" fuel survival via stromal production nutrients (ii) drive mutagenic evolution towards aggressive phenotype, promoting genomic instability. also present evidence "field effect" cancer biology could also related stromal production ROS species. eNOS-expressing fibroblasts ability downregulate Cav-1 induce mitochondrial dysfunction adjacent fibroblasts express eNOS. such, effects stromal oxidative stress laterally propagated, amplified effectively "contagious"--spread cell-to-cell like virus--creating "oncogenic/mutagenic" field promoting widespread DNA damage.
