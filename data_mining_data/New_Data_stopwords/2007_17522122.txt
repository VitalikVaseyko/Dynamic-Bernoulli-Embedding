 present study aimed determine thermal response Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis integrating information various levels biological organization including behavior, metabolic adjustments, heat shock protein expression, protein kinase activity. Behavioral responses determined examining effect warming valve closure opening. Metabolic impacts assessed examining activity key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK). Molecular responses addressed expression Hsp70 Hsp90 phosphorylation stress-activated protein kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) cJun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Mussels increased duration valve closure sixfold acclimated 24 degrees C rather 17 degrees C. indicated activity PK, behavior caused metabolic depression probably shift aerobic anaerobic metabolism. Acclimation temperatures higher 24 degrees C caused increase mortality induced expression Hsp72. Increased phosphorylation p38 MAPK JNKs indicated activation MAPK signaling cascades. potential involvement MAPKs induction Hsp genes tissues M. galloprovincialis discussed. conclusion, seems M. galloprovincialis lives close acclimation limits incipient lethal temperature small degree warming elicit stress responses whole organism molecular levels.
