 white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus produces manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) versatile peroxidase (VP) non-manganese-amended peptone medium (PM). studied effect Mn2+ supplementation MnPs VPs P. ostreatus analysing enzymatic transcript abundance profiles peroxidases, well lignin mineralization rate. fungus grown PM solid-state conditions using perlite inert solid support. Mn2+ amendment resulted 1.7-fold increase [14C]-lignin mineralization relative unamended medium. Anion-exchange chromatography used resolve fungal peroxidase's enzymatic activity profile. Five peaks (P1-P5) VP one peak (P6) MnP activity detected unamended medium. Mn2+-amended medium, reduction activity VPs observed. hand, sharp increase MnP activity level peak P6 detected. P6 isoenzyme purified showed manganese-dependent peroxidation phenolic substrates. Internal sequence analysis purified enzyme revealed 100% identity deduced amino acid sequence P. ostreatus MnP3 (GenBank AB016519). effect Mn2+ relative abundance gene transcripts three VPs one MnP P. ostreatus monitored using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) oligonucleotide primer sets synthesized basis non-conserved sequences different peroxidases. reduction VP gene transcript abundance increase mnp3 transcript level collinear changes observed enzyme activity profiles. results indicate activity peroxidases regulated transcriptional level. suggest expression MnP VP may differentially regulated presence Mn2+.
