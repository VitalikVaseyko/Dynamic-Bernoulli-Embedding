 metabolic phenotype cancer cell determined genetic makeup microenvironment, dynamically modulates tumor landscape. endothelial cells provide promoting protective microenvironment - niche cancer cells. Although metabolic alterations associated cancer progression fairly defined, significant gap understanding cancer metabolism context microenvironment. deployed vitro co-culture system based direct contact cancer cells endothelial cells (E4(+)EC), mimicking tumor microenvironment. Metabolism colon (HTC15 HTC116) ovarian (OVCAR3 SKOV3) cancer cell lines profiled non-targeted metabolic approaches different time points first 48 hours co-culture established. found significant, coherent non-cell line specific changes fatty acids, glycerophospholipids carbohydrates time, induced endothelial cell contact. metabolic patterns pinpoint alterations hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, glycosylation lipid metabolism crucial cancer - endothelial cells interaction. demonstrated "Warburg effect" modulated initial stage nesting cancer cell endothelial niche. study provides novel insight cancer cell metabolism context endothelial microenvironment.
