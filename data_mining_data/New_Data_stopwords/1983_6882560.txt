 Determinations erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase glucose-phosphate isomerase activities carried jaundiced non-jaundiced newborn infants birth 5 days life. hyperbilirubinemias unknown etiology considered. Previous investigations demonstrated erythrocyte age dependent enzyme activities decrease healthy newborn first week life. Following results present paper, jaundiced newborns show decrease, since statistically significant difference paired data glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase jaundiced non-jaundiced newborns found. likely lack decrease enzyme activities jaundiced infants depend upon loss oldest red cells low glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. observation suggests occurrence slight hemolysis newborn infants hyperbilirubinemia unknown etiology.
