 prolonged starvation hyperthyroidism evoke stable increases cardiac pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) activity. Pyruvate inhibits PDHK rat heart mitochondria activation PDHC. sensitivity PDHK inhibition pyruvate declines prolonged starvation. present study, pyruvate concentrations giving 50% active complex (PDHa) mitochondria fed, control fed, hyperthyroid rats 0.3 0.8 mM, respectively, compared 1.0 2.8 mM, respectively mitochondria 24-h-starved 48-h-starved rats. results demonstrate altered pyruvate sensitivity necessity linked altered PDHK activity. PDHK activities mitochondria prepared cardiac myocytes fed rats increased culture 24 h dibutyryl cyclic AMP (50 microM) plus n-octanoate (1 mM), concomitant decline sensitivity PDHK pyruvate inhibition, suggesting changes sensitivity PDHK pyruvate inhibition vivo may secondary increased fatty acid supply cyclic AMP concentrations.
