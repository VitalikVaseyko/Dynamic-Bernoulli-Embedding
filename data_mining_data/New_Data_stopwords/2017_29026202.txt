 accumulation neutral lipids intracellular lipid droplets associated formation progression many cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). Alpha-beta Hydrolase Domain Containing 5 (ABHD5) key regulator intracellular neutral lipids recently identified tumor suppressor colorectal cancer, yet potential role PCa investigated. mining publicly accessible PCa gene expression datasets, found ABHD5 gene expression markedly decreased metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) samples. demonstrated RNAi-mediated ABHD5 silencing promotes, whereas ectopic ABHD5 overexpression inhibits, invasion proliferation PCa cells. Mechanistically, found ABHD5 knockdown induces epithelial mesenchymal transition, increasing aerobic glycolysis upregulating glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 2 phosphofrucokinase, decreasing mitochondrial respiration downregulating respiratory chain complexes III. Interestingly, knockdown ATGL, best-known molecular target ABHD5, impeded proliferation invasion, suggesting ATGL-independent role ABHD5 modulating PCa aggressiveness. Collectively, results provide evidence ABHD5 acts metabolic tumor suppressor PCa prevents EMT Warburg effect, indicates ABHD5 potential therapeutic target mCRPC, deadly aggressive PCa.
