 BACKGROUND: Tumor cells highly dependent glucose even presence oxygen. concept called Warburg effect hallmark cancer strategies considered therapeutically exploit phenomenon ketogenic diets. success strategies dependent profound understanding tumor cell metabolism. new techniques possible thoroughly analyze metabolic responses withdrawal substrates substitution others. present study used gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyze glioblastoma brain tumor cells respond metabolically glucose withdrawn substituted pyruvate. METHODS: Glioblastoma brain tumor cells cultivated medium high (25 mM), medium (11 mM) low (5.5 mM) glucose concentration pyruvate (5 mM). 24 h GC-MS metabolite profiling performed. RESULTS: abundances metabolites dependent supply glucose tendency linear manner indicating saturation high glucose. Noteworthy, high level sorbitol production release observed high concentrations glucose high release alanine, aspartate citrate observed glucose substituted pyruvate. Intermediates TCA cycle present nutritional conditions evidence found cells may perform gluconeogenesis pyruvate. CONCLUSIONS: experiments reveal high plasticity glioblastoma cells changes nutritional supply taken account clinical trials specific diets considered therapy.
