 authors demonstrated estradiol induction key glycolytic enzymes brain (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase) "switched off" injection actinomycin-D--an inhibitor protein biosynthesis. Another steroid hormone, progesterone, inhibitory action enzymes. Administration estradiol rats significantly elevates amplitude frequency contractility induced them, doses progesterone decrease them. Thus, definite correlation induction glycolytic enzymes sensitivity toward contractility one hand estradiol/progesterone ratio other. possible activation glycolysis may reduce threshold epileptic attacks providing additional energy epileptic manifestations.
