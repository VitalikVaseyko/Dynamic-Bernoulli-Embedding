 Leishmania donovani chagasi parasites, transmitted sandflies Lutzomyia longipalpis species complex, normally cause visceral leishmaniasis. However, Central America infections frequently result cutaneous disease. undertook experiments investigate possible influence sandfly saliva course infection. Erythemas caused feeding sandflies correlated well levels erythema-inducing peptide, maxadilan, saliva. Saliva Brazilian flies potent, Colombian flies less so, Costa Rican saliva little maxadilan lacked activity. Nucleotide sequence differences maxadilan gene three species detected 'single strand conformational polymorphism' electrophoresis. Leishmania infections proliferated fastest coinjected saliva Costa Rican flies. Brazilian flies less influence, Colombian flies slight effect. Thus Costa Rican Lutzomyia longipalpis, vectors non-ulcerative cutaneous disease, low vasodilatory activity little maxadilan, saliva strongly enhances cutaneous proliferation Leishmania infections. Conversely, flies Colombia Brazil, vectors visceral disease, maxadilan, exacerbate cutaneous infections lesser degree. coincidental observations suggest species Lutzomyia longipalpis differ propensity modulate pathology disease transmit.
