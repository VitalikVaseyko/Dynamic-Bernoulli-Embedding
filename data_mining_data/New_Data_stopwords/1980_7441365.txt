 effect alanine pyruvate kinase investigated isolated rat hepatocytes. Alanine concentrations 2, 5 10 mM increased glucose production 73% first 30 minutes incubation hepatocytes 9 mM lactate 1 mM pyruvate. 3 minutes, rate affected addition alanine. dose-response study showed maximal stimulation gluconeogenesis achieved 0.5 mM alanine. Using method measured recycling phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, found either fed starved rats, alanine significantly decreased percentage phosphoenolpyruvate recycling lactate substrate. However, significant change recycling noted either pyruvate lactate-pyruvate glucose precursor. study suggests intact liver cells, alanine inhibitory effect pyruvate kinase. However, inhibition sufficient magnitude completely account increase glucose production lactate substrate. hypothesized alanine may effects gluconeogenesis addition inhibiting pyruvate kinase.
