 1. assay, based transfer label [gamma-32P]ATP [32P]phosphoenolpyruvate, suitable steady-state kinetic analysis pyruvate kinase reverse direction (i.e. phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis), described. 2. assay used kinetic investigation rabbit muscle enzyme including initial-rate product-inhibition experiments, pH 7.4 constant concentrations total K+ free Mg2+. 3. studies indicate random release ADP phosphoenolpyruvate enzyme competitive substrate inhibition ATP. results suggestive rapid-equilibrium assumption, generally used enzyme valid. 4. Techniques developed measure rate isotopic exchange substrate-product pairs. 5. using techniques rates isotopic exchange chemical equilibrium measured. results indicate enzyme catalyse truly rapid-equilibrium random mechanism, although forward reaction initial-rate data obtained date consistent assumption.
