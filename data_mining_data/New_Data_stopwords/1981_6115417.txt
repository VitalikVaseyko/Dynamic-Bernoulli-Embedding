 Protein crystallography determined three-dimensional structures 10 13 enzymes glycolytic pathway. Diagrams details enzyme structures given paper. enzyme domains variations extensions many (4--9)-stranded, predominantly totally parallel, beta-sheet shielded solvent alpha-helices (i.e. alpha/beta structures). strong structural similarities domains some, all, enzymes. particular dinucleotide binding fold lactate dehydrogenase beta-barrel triose phosphate isomerase found domains. General rules governing topology packing alpha-helices beta-sheet provide basis combinatorial prediction tertiary fold glycolytic domains amino acid sequence observed secondary structure. predication algorithm demonstrates severe restrictions number possible structures. However, restrictions fully explain remarkable structural similarities different enzymes probably result evolution common ancestor.
