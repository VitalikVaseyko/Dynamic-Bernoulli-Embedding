 Carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) transcription factor activates lipogenic genes liver response excess carbohydrate diet. ChREBP regulated reciprocal manner glucose cAMP. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) phosphorylates two physiologically important sites ChREBP, Ser-196, located near nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS), Thr-666, within basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) site, resulting inactivation nuclear translocation ChREBP DNA-binding activity, respectively. demonstrate crude cytosolic extracts livers rats fed high carbohydrate diet contained protein phosphatase (PPase) activity dephosphorylated peptide containing Ser-196, whereas PPase nuclear extract catalyzed dephosphorylation Ser-568 Thr-666. PPases activated specifically xylulose 5-phosphate (Xu5P), sugar phosphates. Furthermore, addition Xu5P elevated PPase activity level observed extracts fed liver cells. partially purified PPases characterized PP2A-AB delta C immunoblotting specific antibodies. results suggest (ia) Xu5P-dependent PPase responsible activation transcription L-type pyruvate kinase gene lipogenic enzyme genes, (ii) Xu5P glucose signaling compound. Thus, propose Xu5P-activated PPase controls acute long-term regulation glucose metabolism fat synthesis.
