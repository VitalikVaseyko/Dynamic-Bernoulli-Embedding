 investigated whether multiple pathophysiological signals generated peritonitis septic model alter mRNA levels glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes, whether alterations associated glucose dyshomeostasis. Rats sham-operated control group, peritonitis sepsis produced 1 cm cecal incision septic group. 2, 4, 6 hr post-surgery, total cellular RNAs isolated livers, Northern blots performed measure mRNA levels aldolase B (ADL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucokinase (GK). Hepatic PEPCK enzymatic activity measured condensing 14CO2 phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) form malate. Serum glucose concentrations also measured. found following: 2 hr peritonitis sepsis, serum glucose concentrations, mRNA levels enzymes, PEPCK enzymatic activity increased control levels. 4 hr peritonitis sepsis, serum glucose concentrations mRNA levels GK PK continued increase; mRNA levels enzymes, well PEPCK enzymatic activity decreased control levels. 6 hr peritonitis sepsis, serum glucose concentrations, mRNA levels enzymes, PEPCK enzymatic activity decreased control levels. concluded sepsis affects mRNA levels glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes transcriptional level, alterations associated glucose dyshomeostasis.
