 utrophin-dystrophin deficient (DKO) mouse model widely used understand progression Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, unclear extent muscle pathology affects metabolism. Therefore, present study focused understanding energy expenditure whole animal isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle determine changes metabolic enzymes. results show 8 week-old DKO mice consume higher oxygen relative activity levels. Interestingly EDL muscle DKO mouse consumes higher oxygen per unit integral force, generates less force performs better presence pyruvate thus mimicking slow twitch muscle. also found expression hexokinase 1 pyruvate kinase M2 upregulated several fold suggesting increased glycolytic flux. Additionally, dramatic increase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp 1) mitofusin 2 protein levels suggesting increased mitochondrial fission fusion, feature associated increased energy demand altered mitochondrial dynamics. Collectively studies point dystrophic disease caused significant changes muscle metabolism. meet increased energetic demand, upregulation metabolic enzymes regulators mitochondrial fusion fission observed dystrophic muscle. better understanding metabolic demands accompanied alterations dystrophic muscle help us design improved intervention therapies along existing drug treatments DMD patients.
