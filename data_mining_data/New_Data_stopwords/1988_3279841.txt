 Charles River male Wistar rats (200-300 g) meal fed 9-10 days, injected either saline, epidermal growth factor (EGF), ethanol, ethanol combined EGF livers freeze clamped 5 min intraperitoneal injection EGF. Metabolites measured redox state phosphorylation potential calculated. Epidermal growth factor alone elevated hepatic content glucose 1-P, glucose 6-P, fructose 6-P, 3-phosphoglycerate 1.2-1.3-fold compared saline treatment. Ethanol alone decreased hepatic content 3-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate 3.2-3.7-fold saline-treated levels. Ethanol, combination EGF, decreased hepatic values 3-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate 2.0-2.3-fold saline treatment elevated content phosphoenolpyruvate 1.6-fold ethanol treatment alone. Epidermal growth factor inhibited pyruvate kinase activity 1.3-fold compared saline controls ethanol presence EGF facilitated recovery activity enzyme.
