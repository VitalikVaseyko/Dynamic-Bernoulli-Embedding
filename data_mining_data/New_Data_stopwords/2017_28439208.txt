 BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) global health problem, infected patients left untreated may develop cirrhosis eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. study aims enlighten pathways associated HBV related liver fibrosis delineation potential new therapeutic targets biomarkers. METHODS: Tissue samples 47 HBV infected patients different fibrotic stages (F1 F6) enrolled 2D-DIGE proteomic screening. Differentially expressed proteins identified mass spectrometry verified western blotting. Functional proteomic associations analyzed EnrichNet application. RESULTS: Fibrotic stage variations observed apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), pyruvate kinase PKM (KPYM), glyceraldehyde 3-phospahate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (DHE3), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), alcohol dehydrogenase (ALDH1A1), transferrin (TRFE), peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3), phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein (PBLD), immuglobulin kappa chain C region (IGKC), annexin A4 (ANXA4), keratin 5 (KRT5). Enrichment analysis Reactome Kegg databases highlighted possible involvement platelet release, glycolysis HDL mediated lipid transport pathways. Moreover, string analysis revealed HIF-1alpha (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha), one interacting partners HBx (Hepatitis B X protein), may play role altered glycolytic response oxidative stress observed liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: knowledge, first protomic research studies HBV infected fibrotic human liver tissues investigate alterations protein levels affected pathways among different fibrotic stages. Observed changes glycolytic pathway caused HBx presence therefore interactions HIF-1alpha target pathway novel therapeutic purposes.
