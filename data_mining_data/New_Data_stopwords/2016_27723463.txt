 Bisphenol (BPA), environmental endocrine disruptor, important industrial raw material. wide use BPA increased risk BPA release environment, become new environmental pollutant. work, ecological deleterious effects new pollutant soybean roots different growth stages investigated determining contents mineral elements (P, K, Ca, Mg) analyzing root activity activities critical respiratory enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase). results revealed low dose (1.5mg/L) BPA increased levels P, K, Mg, Ca soybean roots different growth stages. Whereas, high doses (6.0 12.0mg/L) BPA decreased levels P, K, Mg contents dose-dependent manner. BPA promotive effect content Ca soybean roots. Synchronous observation showed aforementioned dual response BPA also observed root activity respiratory enzyme activities. effects BPA mineral element contents, root activity respiratory enzyme activities soybean roots different growth stages followed order: flowering podding stage>seed-filling stage>seedling stage (mineral element contents); seedling stage>flowering podding stage>seed-filling stage (root activity respiratory enzyme activities). word, response plant root activity respiratory enzyme activities BPA pollution pathway BPA affecting mineral element contents plant roots.
