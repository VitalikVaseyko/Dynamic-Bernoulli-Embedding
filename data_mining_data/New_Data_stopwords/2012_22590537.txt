 BACKGROUND: Hepatic insulin resistance impairs insulin's ability suppress hepatic glucose production (HGP) contributes development type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although interests discover novel genes modulate insulin sensitivity HGP high, remains challenging human cell based system identify novel genes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: identify genes modulate hepatic insulin signaling HGP, generated human cell line stably expressing beta-lactamase control human glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) promoter (AH-G6PC cells). beta-lactamase activity endogenous G6PC mRNA increased AH-G6PC cells combination dexamethasone pCPT-cAMP, reduced insulin. 4-gene High-Throughput-Genomics assay developed concomitantly measure G6PC pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase-4 (PDK4) mRNA levels. Using assay, screened siRNA library containing pooled siRNA targeting 6650 druggable genes identified 614 hits lowered G6PC expression without increasing PDK4 mRNA levels. Pathway analysis indicated siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) genes known positively negatively affect insulin signaling increased decreased G6PC mRNA expression, respectively, thus validating screening platform. subset 270 primary screen hits selected 149 hits confirmed target gene KD pooled siRNA 7 single siRNA gene reduce G6PC expression 4-gene HTG assay. Subsequently, pooled siRNA KD 113 genes decreased PEPCK and/or PGC1alpha mRNA expression thereby demonstrating role regulating key gluconeogenic genes addition G6PC. Last, KD 61 113 genes potentiated insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, suggesting suppress gluconeogenic gene enhancing insulin signaling. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: results support proposition proteins encoded genes identified cell-based druggable genome siRNA screen hold potential serve novel pharmacological targets treatment T2D.
