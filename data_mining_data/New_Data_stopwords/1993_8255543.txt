 Activity levels enzymes glycolytic pathway viz., hexokinase (EC.2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (EC.2.7.1.11), aldolase (EC.4.1.2.13), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC.1.2.1.12), enolase (EC.4.2.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC.2.7.1.40) lactate dehydrogenase (EC.1.1.1.27) estimated cerebral cortex, cerebellum brainstem rats treated subacute acute doses ammonium acetate compared control animals. general, activities enzymes except hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase, elevated three regions brain. results suggests enhanced rate glycolysis brain hyperammonemic states strengthens role ammonium ion stimulating certain enzymes glycolytic pathway.
