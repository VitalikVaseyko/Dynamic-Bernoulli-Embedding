 BACKGROUND: switch oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis proliferating cancer cells, even aerobic conditions, shown first 1926 Otto Warburg. Today phenomenon known "Warburg effect" recognized hallmark cancer. metabolic shift glycolysis associated alterations signaling pathways involved energy metabolism, including glucose uptake fermentation, regulation mitochondrial functions. Hexokinases (HKs), catalyze first step glycolysis, identified play role tumorigenesis human colorectal cancer (CRC) melanoma. However, mechanism action HKs promotion tumor growth remains unclear. RESULTS: purpose present study investigate effect silencing hexokinase genes (HK1, HK2, HK3) colorectal cancer (HT-29, SW 480, HCT-15, RKO, HCT 116) melanoma (MDA-MB-435S SK-MEL-28) cell lines using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vectors. shRNA lentiviral plasmid vectors pLSLP-HK1, pLSLP-HK2, pLSLP-HK3 constructed transfected separately co-transfected cells. HK2 inactivation associated increased expression HK1 colorectal cancer cell lines pointing compensation effect. Simultaneous attenuation HK1 HK2 levels led decreased cell viability. Co-transfection shRNA vectors HK1, HK2, HK3 mRNAs resulted rapid cell death via apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: demonstrated simultaneous inactivation HK1 HK2 sufficient decrease proliferation viability melanoma colorectal cancer cells. results suggest HK1 HK2 could key therapeutic targets reducing aerobic glycolysis examined cancers.
