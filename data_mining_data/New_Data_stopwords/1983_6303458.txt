 Streptozotocin-induced maternal diabetes shown alter developmental patterns carbohydrate-metabolizing enzyme activities, glycogen deposition surfactant levels late fetal rat lung tissue-specific manner, follows: (a) marked reduction glycogen synthase activity, due aberrant interconversion active inactive forms enzyme; less glycogen thus accumulated; (b) lowered activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase term; (c) reduced disaturated phosphatidylcholine (surfactant) concentrations. diminished synthesis accumulation glycogen glycolytic capacity lungs fetuses diabetic mothers related reduction surfactant level, underlies respiratory distress syndrome frequently encountered neonates diabetic pregnancies.
