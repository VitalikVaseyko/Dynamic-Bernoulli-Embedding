 Dual PI3K/mTOR(phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target rapamycin) inhibitors evaluated clinically treatment tumors hyperactivated PI3K/mTOR pathway. However, unexpected outcomes obtained clinical studies cancer patients aberrant PI3K pathway. clinical trials, applicable combination regimens yet available. study, using integrated analysis acquired BEZ235-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, demonstrate DNA methyltransferase key modulator common node upstream AKT/mTOR PDK1/MYC pathways, activated cancer cells acquired BEZ235 resistance. DNA methyltransferases upregulated induced PTEN PPP2R2B gene hypermethylation, downregulated expression BEZ235-resistant cancer cells. Reduced PTEN PPP2R2B expression correlated activated AKT/mTOR PDK1/MYC pathways conferred considerable BEZ235 resistance nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Targeting methyltransferases combination BEZ235 sensitized BEZ235-resistant cells BEZ235 vitro vivo, suggesting potential clinical application strategy overcome BEZ235 resistance.
