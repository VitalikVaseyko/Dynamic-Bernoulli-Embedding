 Understanding mechanisms free energy transfer metabolism fundamental understanding chemical forces sustain molecular organization cell distributed. Recent studies molecular motors (1-3) ATP-driven proton transport (4-6) describe chemical potential transferred molecular level. systems catalyze energy transfer structural change appear dedicated exclusively coupling tasks (7, 8). report discovery new class energy-transfer system. biosynthetic pump composed cysteine biosynthesis enzymes, ATP sulfurylase O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, catalytic function whose interactions emerge new function: hydrolysis ATP. hydrolysis kinetically energetically linked chemistry catalyzed ATP sulfurylase, first enzyme cysteine biosynthetic pathway, way molecule ATP hydrolyzed, stroke pump, produces 1 equivalent enzyme's product. findings integrate cysteine metabolism broaden understanding ways higher order allostery used effect free energy transfer.
