 distribution glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway enzymes, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, determined leaf tissues two C(3)-plants, pea leek, two C(4)-plants, maize sorghum. enzymes examined found epidermal tissue. pea, maize, sorghum leaves, specific activities enzymes usually higher nonphotosynthetic epidermal tissue photosynthetic tissues leaves. leek leaves, etiolated, specific activities similar epidermal mesophyll tissue. distribution rate limiting enzymes glycolysis oxidative pentose phosphate pathways probably reflects capacity tissue generate NADH, NADPH, ATP oxidation glucose. capacity appears greater leaf tissues unable generate reducing equivalents ATP photosynthesis, is, epidermal tissues etiolated mesophyll tissue.
