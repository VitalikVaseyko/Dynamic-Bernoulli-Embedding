 Osteosarcoma common primary bone tumour. Increasing evidence demonstrated pathogenic role microRNA (miRNAs) dysregulation tumour development. miR-379 previously reported function oncogenic tumour-suppressing miRNA tissue-dependent manner. However, function osteosarcoma remains unknown. study, found expression miR-379 downregulated osteosarcoma tissues cell lines. functional characterization revealed miR-379 suppressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation invasion vitro retarded growth osteosarcoma xenografts vivo. Mechanistically, PDK1 identified direct target miR-379 osteosarcoma, PDK1 expression up-regulated showed inverse correlation miR-379. Enforced expression PDK1 promoted osteosarcoma cell proliferation rescued anti-proliferative effect miR-379. data suggest miR-379 could function tumour-suppressing miRNA via targeting PDK1 osteosarcoma.
