 propose simplified procedure purification Neurospora crassa pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. purified complex showed four protein bands apparent Mr values 53,400, 52,900, 49,000 36,900 upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Components, E2 E3, N. crassa pyruvate dehydrogenase complex identified, respectively, polypeptides 49,000 53,400. deduced component E1 constituted two subunits Mr values 52,900 36,900. Km values towards different substrates optimal pH temperature determined. protein kinase activity associated core enzyme present highly purified preparations. demonstrated protein components complex synthesized control nuclear genome.
