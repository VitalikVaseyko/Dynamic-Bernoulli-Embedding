 Explantation cultivation vitro 55 human biopsies histologically normal urothelial tissue, 63 biopsies transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) revealed primary success rate 75% secondary success rate 50% significant differences, normal TCC derived cultures. half subcultured biopsies normal origin able grow 4 passages TCC derived cultures able so. Based morphology, life span, invasive growth co-cultured fragments embryonic chick heart, tumorigenicity nude mice following transformation grades (TGr) defined: Normal (TGr 0), non-malignant prolonged, finite life span (TGr I), premalignant infinite life span without tumorigenic invasive potential (TGr II), malignant infinite life span tumorigenic invasive properties (TGr III). Differentiation TGr - TGr III possible several parameters, including cytological characteristics, molecular immunological surface structure, relative oncogene expression, pyruvate kinase isoenzymes, DNA Repair, growth pattern. However, addition common characteristics, individual cell lines various categories transformation showed differences allowed identification well defined cell lines sublines.
