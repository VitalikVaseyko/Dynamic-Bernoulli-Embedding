 Early diagnosis well individualized therapies necessary reduce mortality breast cancer, personalized patient care strategies rely novel prognostic predictive factors. study, six breast cancer patients, 2D gel analysis applied studying protein expression differences order distinguish invasive ductal breast carcinoma, frequent breast tumor subtype, control samples. total, 1203 protein spots assembled 2D reference gel. Differentially abundant spots subjected peptide mass fingerprinting protein identification. Twenty proteins corresponding 38 differentially expressed 2D gel spots contained previously reported proteome signature, suggesting distinct protein forms contributing. In-depth MS/MS measurements enabled analyses protein structure details selected proteins. protein spots significantly contributed signature, found glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase N-terminally truncated, pyruvate kinase M2 nucleoside diphosphate kinase isoforms proteins importance, nucleophosmin phosphorylation serine residues 106 125 clearly identified. Principle component analysis hierarchical clustering normalized quantitative data 38 spots resulted accurate separation tumor control samples. Thus, separation tissue samples initial proteome signature could confirmed even different proteome analysis platform. addition, detailed protein structure investigations enabled refining proteome signature invasive ductal breast carcinoma, opening way structure-/function studies respect disease processes and/or therapeutic intervention.
