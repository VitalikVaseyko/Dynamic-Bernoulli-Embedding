 Combustion smoke contains gases particulates, act via hypoxia cytotoxicity producing mechanisms injure cells tissues. carbon monoxide (CO) major toxicant smoke, toxicity exacerbated presence compounds. Here, examined modulations mitochondrial cytosolic energy metabolism inhalation combustion smoke versus CO, vivo, rat brain. Measurements revealed reduced activities respiratory chain (RC) complexes, greater inhibition smoke equivalent CO ambient air. case RC complex IV, inhibition CO smoke similar--suggesting complex IV inhibition primarily action CO. contrast, inhibition complexes III greater smoke. Increases cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities accompanied inhibition RC complexes, likely reflecting compensatory increases cytosolic energy production. Together, data provide new insights mechanisms smoke inhalation-induced perturbations brain energetics, impact neuronal function contribute development neuropathologies survivors exposures CO combustion smoke.
