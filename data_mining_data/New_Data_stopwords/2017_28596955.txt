 (13)C metabolic flux analysis ((13)C MFA) important systems biology technique used investigate microbial metabolism decades. heterotrimer Snf1 kinase complex plays key role preference Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits glucose galactose, phenomenon known glucose repression carbon catabolite repression. SIP1 gene, encoding part complex, received little attention, presumably, knockout lacks growth phenotype. present fluxomic investigation relative effects presence galactose classically glucose-repressing media and/or knockout SIP1 using multi-scale variant (13)C MFA known 2-Scale (13)C metabolic flux analysis (2S-(13)C MFA). study, strains galactose metabolism deactivated (gal1Delta background) able separate metabolic effects purely related glucose repression arising galactose metabolism. resulting flux profiles reveal presence galactose classically glucose-repressing conditions, CEN.PK113-7D gal1Delta background, results substantial decrease pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux increased flow cytosolic pyruvate malate mitochondria toward cytosolic branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. fluxomic redistributions accompanied higher maximum specific growth rate, seemingly violation glucose repression. Deletion SIP1 CEN.PK113-7D gal1Delta cells grown mixed glucose/galactose medium results increase. Knockout gene cells grown glucose-only medium results change growth rate corresponding decrease glucose ethanol exchange fluxes flux pathways involved aspartate/threonine biosynthesis. Glucose repression appears violated 1/10 ratio galactose-to-glucose. Based scientific literature, may conducted experiments near critical sugar ratio known allow galactose enter cell. Additionally, report number fluxomic changes associated growth rate increases unexpected flux profile redistributions resulting deletion SIP1 glucose-only medium.
