 Metabolic reprogramming altered bioenergetics emerged hallmarks cancer area active basic translational cancer research. Drastically upregulated glucose transport metabolism cancers regardless oxygen supply, phenomenon called Warburg effect, major focuses research. Warburg speculated cancer cells, due defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), switch glycolysis ATP synthesis, even presence oxygen. Studies recent decade indicated glycolysis indeed drastically upregulated almost cancer cells, mitochondrial respiration continues operate normally rates proportional oxygen supply. OXPHOS-to-glycolysis switch rather upregulation glycolysis. Furthermore, upregulated glycolysis appears synthesis biomass reducing equivalents addition ATP production. new finding significant amount glycolytic intermediates diverted pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) production NADPH profound implications cancer cells use Warburg effect cope reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation oxidative stress, opening door anticancer interventions taking advantage this. Recent findings Warburg effect relationship ROS oxidative stress controls reviewed. Cancer treatment strategies based new findings presented discussed.
