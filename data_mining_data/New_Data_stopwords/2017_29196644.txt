 work, performed comparative adaptive laboratory evolution experiment important biotechnological platform strain Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 prophage-free variant MB001 towards improved growth rates glucose minimal medium. strains displayed comparable adaptation behavior significant differences genomic rearrangements mutation frequencies. Remarkably, significant fitness leap 20% observed strains already 100 generations. Isolated top clones (UBw UBm) showed 26% increased growth rate glucose minimal medium. Genome sequencing evolved clones populations resulted identification key mutations pyk (pyruvate kinase), fruK (1-phosphofructokinase) corA encoding Mg(2+) importer. reintegration selected pyk fruK mutations resulted increased glucose consumption rate ptsG expression causative accelerated growth glucose minimal medium, whereas corA mutations improved growth Mg(2+) limiting conditions. Overall, study resulted identification causative key mutations improving growth C. glutamicum glucose. identified mutational hot spots well two evolved top strains, UBw UBm, represent promising targets future metabolic engineering approaches.
