 Cancer cells cooperate stromal cells use environment promote tumor growth. Energy production depends nutrient availability O(2) concentration. Well-oxygenated cells highly proliferative reorient glucose metabolism towards biosynthesis, whereas glutamine oxidation replenishes TCA cycle coupled OXPHOS-ATP production. Glucose, glutamine alanine transformations sustain nucleotide fatty acid synthesis. contrast, hypoxic cells slow proliferation, enhance glycolysis produce ATP reject lactate recycled fuel normoxic cells. Thus, glucose spared biosynthesis and/or hypoxic cell function. Environmental cells, fibroblasts adipocytes, serve food donors cancer cells, reject waste products (CO(2) , H(+), ammoniac, polyamines...) promoting EMT, invasion, angiogenesis proliferation. metabolic-coupling considered form commensalism whereby non-malignant cells support growth cancer cells. Understanding cellular cooperations within tumors may source inspiration develop new anti-cancer agents.
