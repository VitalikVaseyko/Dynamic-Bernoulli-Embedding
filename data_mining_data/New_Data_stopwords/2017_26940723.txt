 Skeletal muscles require energy either constant low (e.g., standing posture) immediate high rates (e.g., exercise). fulfill requirements, myocytes utilize phosphocreatine (PCr)/creatine (Cr) system fast energy buffer shuttle. generated mice lacking L-arginine:glycine amidino transferase (AGAT), first enzyme creatine biosynthesis. AGAT(-/-) (d/d) mice devoid PCr/Cr system reveal severely altered oxidative phosphorylation. addition, exhibit complete resistance diet-induced obesity, associated chronic activation AMP-activated protein kinase muscle white adipose tissue. underlying metabolic rearrangements yet analyzed. Here, performed gene expression analysis skeletal muscle serum amino acid profile d/d mice revealing transcriptomic metabolic alterations pyruvate glucose pathways. Differential pyruvate tolerance tests demonstrated preferential conversion pyruvate alanine, supported increased protein levels enzymes involved pyruvate alanine metabolism. Pyruvate tolerance tests suggested severely impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis despite increased availability pyruvate alanine. Furthermore, enzymes serine production one-carbon metabolism significantly up-regulated d/d mice, indicating increased de novo formation one-carbon units carbohydrate metabolism linked NAD(P)H production. Besides well-established function PCr/Cr system energy metabolism, transcriptomic metabolic analyses suggest plays pivotal role systemic one-carbon metabolism, oxidation/reduction, biosynthetic processes. Therefore, PCr/Cr system energy buffer shuttle, also crucial component involved numerous systemic metabolic processes.
