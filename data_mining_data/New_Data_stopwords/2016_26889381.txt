 BACKGROUND: Hypoxia inflammation identified hallmarks cancer. majority hepatocellular carcinomas preceded hepatitis B- C-related chronic infections suggesting liver cancer development promoted inflammatory microenvironment. inflammatory cytokine oncostatin (OSM) shown induce expression hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) normoxic conditions hepatocytes hepatoma cells. HIF-1 alpha known orchestrate expression numerous genes, many code metabolic enzymes play key roles adaptation cellular metabolism low oxygen tension. RESULTS: Here, show OSM-induced upregulation HIF-1 alpha reprograms cellular metabolism three clones human hepatocyte cell line PH5CH (PH5CH1, PH5CH7, PH5CH8) towards hypoxia-like metabolic phenotype significant effect cellular metabolism HepG2 JHH-4 hepatoma cells. Although observed minor changes glucose uptake lactate secretion PH5CH8 upon OSM treatment, identified pronounced changes intracellular fluxes based stable isotope labeling experiments. particular, glucose oxidation tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1)-mediated inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thereby reducing oxidative TCA cycle flux. result impaired mitochondrial glucose glutamine oxidation, reductive isocitrate dehydrogenase flux increased. CONCLUSIONS: provide evidence connects inflammatory mediator OSM hypoxia-like metabolic phenotype. human hepatocyte cell line PH5CH, OSM-mediated upregulation HIF-1 alpha PDK1 induce hypoxia-like metabolic changes, although lesser extent hypoxia itself. Since PDK1 overexpressed several cancers, might provide causal link chronic inflammation malignant cellular transformation.
