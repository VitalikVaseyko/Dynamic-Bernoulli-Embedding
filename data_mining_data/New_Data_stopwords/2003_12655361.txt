 nonallosteric regulation mechanism enzyme reaction velocity assumes substrate enzyme interact via metal cation form simple mixed, mono- multi-nuclear complexes. solution equations individual cases gives function initial reaction velocity given substrate modifier concentration. function describe kinetic effects considered allosteric, well phenomena omitted commonly-accepted models.
