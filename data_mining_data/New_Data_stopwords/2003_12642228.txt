 Carbohydrate metabolism examined developing rat salivary glands analysing enzymatic activity glycogen content postnatal parotid submandibular glands. following enzymes carbohydrate metabolism, hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) well content glycogen determined salivary glands rats aged 2, 7, 14, 21, 30 60 days. specific activity HK increased days 2 21 decreased 60 days old. values found submandibular glands 2.5 4.9 times higher found parotid gland, except rats aged 60 days. PFK-1 showed different pattern variation glands. submandibular gland statistically significant increase PFK-1 specific activity 2 30 days age then, 60 days old group return level rats aged 2 days. parotid gland, specific activity PFK-1 decreased 2 7 days age, 7 14 days specific activity increased markedly 14 60 days old gradually decreased. specific activity PK followed pattern variation submandibular parotid glands, showing great variation. specific activity LDH decreased 2 60 days old submandibular glands. parotid glands mean values enzyme higher 2 days old group, decreased remained less constant. potential capacity pentose phosphate pathway greater glycolysis early ages. glycogen content showed similar variation glands. initially high decreased. conclusion, results activities enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism submandibular parotid glands may relevant initiation saliva secretion animals.
