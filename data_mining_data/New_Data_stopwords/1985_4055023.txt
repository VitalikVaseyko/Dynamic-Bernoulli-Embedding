 biochemical mechanisms acidogenic potential Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 grown glucose-excess glucose-limited continuous culture studied. rate acid production glucose metabolism cells grown glucose limitation (glucose-limited cells) 2.1 2.6 times cells grown excess glucose (glucose-excess cells). glucose-limited cells metabolizing glucose, intracellular concentrations glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate higher, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate lower, glucose-excess cells metabolizing glucose. levels fructose 1,6-bisphosphate dihydroxyacetone phosphate significantly different cells. activities glucose-phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system decriptified cells glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cell-free extracts glucose-limited cells higher glucose-excess cells. activities glucokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase cell-free extracts cells different significantly. conclude high glycolytic activity glucose-limited cells results increase synthesis glucose-phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
