 Tumor cells undergo critical remodeling intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis contribute important cancer hallmarks. Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), Ca(2+) entry pathway modulated mitochondria, dramatically enhanced colon cancer cells. addition, cancer cells display Warburg effect, metabolic switch mitochondrial metabolism glycolysis provides survival advantages. Accordingly, investigated mitochondria control store-operated currents (SOCs) two cell lines previously selected representing human normal colonic cells colon cancer cells. found that, normal cells, mitochondria important SOCs activity unable prevent current inactivation. contrast, colon cancer cells, mitochondria dispensable SOCs activation able prevent slow, Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation SOCs. effect associated increased ability tumor cell mitochondria take Ca(2+) due increased mitochondrial potential (DeltaPsi) linked Warburg effect. Consistently view, selected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) depolarize mitochondria, inhibit mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake promote SOC inactivation, leading inhibition SOCE cancer cell proliferation. Thus, mitochondria sustain store-operated currents colon cancer cells normal colonic cells effect counteracted selected NSAIDs providing mechanism cancer chemoprevention.
