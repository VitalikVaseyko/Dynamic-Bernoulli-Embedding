 Protein kinase C-related protein kinases (PRKs) effectors Rho family small GTPases play role development diseases prostate cancer hepatitis C. examined mechanism underlying regulation PRK2 N-terminal region. show N-terminal region PRK2 prevents interaction upstream kinase, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), phosphorylates activation loop PRK2. confirm N-terminal region directly inhibits kinase activity PRK2. However, contrast previous models, data indicate inhibition mediated trans intermolecular PRK2-PRK2 interaction. results also suggest amino acids 487-501, located linker region N-terminal domains catalytic domain, contribute PRK2-PRK2 dimer formation. dimerization supported N-terminal domains. Additionally, provide evidence region C-terminal catalytic domain intramolecularly activates PRK2. Finally, discovered catalytic domain mediates cross-talk inhibitory N-terminal region activating C-terminal region. results presented describe novel mechanism regulation among AGC kinases offer new insights potential approaches pharmacologically regulate PRK2.
