 Extremities, peptide maps phosphorylatable site localization human erythrocyte L' liver L pyruvate kinases (EC 2.7.1.40) investigated. L' L subunits seemed similar, blocked NH2 termini differ sensitivity carboxypeptidase A, say C-terminal ends. digestion Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, phosphorylated sites L' L subunits located peptides different L' L, say C-terminal sides. mild proteolytic attack native tetrameric enzymes trypsin partially degraded phosphorylatable peptides without removing phosphoserine residue; conditions, chymotrypsin split phosphorylated residue subtilisin totally degraded phosphorylated peptides. results appears, therefore, age-dependent proteolytic degradation L' subunits old red cells involves C-terminal side molecules, ultimately resulting cleavage phosphorylated site. Since erythrocyte L' liver L subunits encoded different species messenger RNAs, results indicate, addition, messenger RNA species differ 3' coding sequences.
