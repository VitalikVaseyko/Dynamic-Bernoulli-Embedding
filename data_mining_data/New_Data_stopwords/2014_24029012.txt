 l-lactate formation occurs via reduction pyruvate catalyzed lactate dehydrogenase. l-lactate removal takes place via oxidation pyruvate, may oxidized converted glucose. Pyruvate oxidation involves cooperative effort pyruvate dehydrogenase, tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial respiratory chain. Enzymes gluconeogenesis pathway sequentially convert pyruvate glucose. addition, pyruvate may undergo reversible transamination alanine alanine aminotransferase. Enzymes involved l-lactate metabolism crucial diabetes pathophysiology therapy. Elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase concentration associated insulin resistance. Polymorphisms G6PC2 gene associated fasting glucose concentration insulin secretion. diabetes patients, pyruvate dehydrogenase down-regulated activity pyruvate carboxylase diminished pancreatic islets. Inhibitors fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase investigated potential therapy type 2 diabetes. addition, enzymes implicated l-lactate metabolism revealed important cancer cell homeostasis. Many human tumors higher LDH5 levels normal tissues. LDHC gene expressed broad range tumors. activation PDH potential mediator body response protects cancer PDH activation observed reduce glioblastoma growth. expression PDK1 may serve biomarker poor prognosis gastric cancer. Mitochondrial DNA mutations detected number human cancers. Genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase tumor suppressor functions consequently mutations genes may cause variety tumors.
