 Aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), malic enzyme (ME), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities cytosolic mitochondrial fractions gill tissue Modiolus demissus (ribbed mussel), Mytilus edulis (sea mussel), Crassostrea virginica (oyster) Mercenaria mercenaria (quahog) determined using enzyme assay starch gel electrophoresis combined subcellular fractionation. AAT showed distinct mitochondrial cytosolic isozymes gills animals. Although ALAT showed distinct mitochondrial cytosolic isozymes gills oysters, sea mussels quahogs, mitochondrial ALAT evident ribbed mussel gill tissue. PK PEPCK cytosolic preparations. found mitochondrial fraction ribbed mussel quahog gill tissue whereas sea mussel gills showed distinct cytosolic mitochondrial isozymes. oyster gills, "cytosolic ME" electrophoretically identical mitochondrial indicating vivo, probably mitochondrial. MDH showed distinct cytosolic mitochondrial isozymes bivalve gills tested.
