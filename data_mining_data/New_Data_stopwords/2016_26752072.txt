 Dysregulated signaling cascades alter energy metabolism promote cell proliferation cyst expansion polycystic kidney disease (PKD). tested whether metabolic reprogramming towards aerobic glycolysis ("Warburg effect") plays pathogenic role male heterozygous Han:SPRD rats (Cy/+), chronic progressive model PKD. Using microarray analysis qPCR, found upregulation genes involved glycolysis (Hk1, Hk2, Ldha) downregulation genes involved gluconeogenesis (G6pc, Lbp1) cystic kidneys Cy/+ rats compared wild-type (+/+) rats. tested effect inhibiting glycolysis 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) renal functional loss cyst progression 5-week-old male Cy/+ rats. Treatment 2DG (500 mg/kg/day) 5 weeks resulted significantly lower kidney weights (-27%) 2-kidney/total-body-weight ratios (-20%) decreased renal cyst index (-48%) compared vehicle treatment. Cy/+ rats treated 2DG also showed higher clearances creatinine (1.98+/-0.67 vs 1.41+/-0.37 ml/min), BUN (0.69+/-0.26 vs 0.40+/-0.10 ml/min) uric acid (0.38+/-0.20 vs 0.21+/-0.10 ml/min), reduced albuminuria. Immunoblotting analysis kidney tissues harvested 2DG-treated Cy/+ rats showed increased phosphorylation AMPK-alpha, negative regulator mTOR, restoration ERK signaling. Assessment Ki-67 staining indicated 2DG limits cyst progression inhibition epithelial cell proliferation. Taken together, results show targeting glycolytic pathway may represent promising therapeutic strategy control cyst growth PKD.
