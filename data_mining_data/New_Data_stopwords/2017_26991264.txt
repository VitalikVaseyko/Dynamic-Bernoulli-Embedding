 BACKGROUND: Evaluations stress-induced cardiac functional alterations adults neonatal glucocorticoid (GC) treatment limited. present study, evaluated adult cardiac functional recovery postischemic reperfusion measured cardiac gene expression involved energy metabolism rats neonatally treated dexamethasone (DEX). METHOD: Male Wistar rats injected DEX first 3 birth controls received saline (SAL). 24 wk age, insulin tolerance tests performed, plasma lipid levels measured, left ventricular function myocardial infarct size evaluated. Expressions genes involved cardiac energy metabolism measured quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) western blot. RESULTS: 24-wk-old rats, neonatal DEX administration caused dyslipidemia, impaired cardiac recovery function increased size infarction, decreased cardiac expression glucose transporter 4(GLUT4), peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) ratios phospho-forkhead box O1/forkhead box O1 (p-FoxO1/FoxO1) phospho AMP-activated protein kinase/AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK/AMPK) increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) expression compared controls. CONCLUSION: Neonatal DEX administration impairs cardiac functional recovery reperfusion following ischemia 24-wk-old rats. Reduced cardiac glucose utilization may contribute long-term detrimental effects caused neonatal DEX treatment.
