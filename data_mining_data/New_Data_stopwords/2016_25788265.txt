 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) contributes Warburg effect, hallmark cancer. showed PKM2 levels correlated overall survival (hazard ration = 1.675, 95% confidence interval: 1.389-2.019, P < 0.001) disease-free survival (hazard ration = 1.573, 95% confidence interval: 1.214-2.038, P < 0.001) cohort 490 patients HCC. correlations validated independent cohort 148 HCC patients. Multivariate analyses revealed PKM2 independent indicator poor outcome HCC. knockdown PKM2 HCC cells inhibited cell proliferation induced apoptosis vitro vivo. Bim siRNA markedly abolished PKM2-depletion-induced apoptosis. PKM2 depletion decreased degradation Bim. clinical samples, PKM2 expression reversely correlated Bim expression. Combination PKM2 Bim levels best prognostic significance. suggest PKM2 serves promising biomarker poor prognosis patients HCC knockdown induces HCC apoptosis stabilizing Bim.
