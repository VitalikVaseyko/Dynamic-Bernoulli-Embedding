 BACKGROUND: first glance, appears high degree similarity metabolism yeast (the Crabtree effect) human cancer cells (the Warburg effect). root effects accelerated metabolic flow glycolysis leads overflows ethanol lactic acid, respectively. proposed enhanced glycolytic flow cancer cells triggered altered kinetic characteristics key glycolytic regulatory enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (Pfk). posttranslational modification, highly active shorter Pfk-M fragments, resistant feedback inhibition, formed proteolytic cleavage C-terminus native human Pfk-M. Alternatively, enhanced glycolysis triggered optimal growth conditions yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RESULTS: assess deregulation glycolysis yeast cells, sfPFKM gene encoding highly active human shorter Pfk-M fragments introduced pfk-null S. cerevisiae. growth transformants sfPFKM gene observed glucose fructose. Glucose even induced rapid deactivation Pfk1 activities transformants. However, Pfk1 activities sfPFKM transformants detected maltose medium, growth maltose possible addition 10 mM ethanol medium. Ethanol seemed alleviate severely unbalanced NADH/NADPH ratio sfPFKM cells. However, transformants carrying modified Pfk-M enzymes grew faster transformants human native human Pfk-M enzyme narrow ecological niche low maltose concentration medium improved additional modifications. Interestingly, periodic extracellular accumulation phenylacetaldehyde detected growth strain modified Pfk-M strain encoding human native enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Highly active cancer-specific shorter Pfk-M fragments appear trigger several controlling mechanisms primary metabolism yeast S. cerevisiae cells. results suggest complex metabolic regulation present S. cerevisiae free living unicellular eukaryotic organisms comparison metazoan human cells. However, increased productivity broader growth conditions may achieved gene engineering performed reduce omit several controlling mechanisms.
