 PURPOSE: goal study identify quantify differentially expressed proteins human nuclear cataract different axial lengths. METHODS: Thirty-six samples human lens nuclei hardness grade III IV obtained cataract surgery extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). Six healthy transparent human lens nuclei obtained fresh healthy cadaver eyes corneal transplantation surgery. lens nuclei divided seven groups (six lenses group) according optic axis: Group (mean axial length 28.7+/-1.5 mm; average age 59.8+/-1.9 years), Group B (mean axial length 23.0+/-0.4 mm; average age 60.3+/-2.5 years), Group C (mean axial length 19.9+/-0.5 mm; average age 55.1+/-2.5 years), Group (mean axial length 28.7+/-1.4 mm; average age 58.0+/-4.0 years), Group E (mean axial length 23.0+/-0.3 mm; average age 56.9+/-4.2 years), Group F (mean axial length 20.7+/-0.6 mm; average age 57.6+/-5.3 years). six healthy transparent human lenses included younger group standard optic axes, Group G (mean axial length 23.0+/-0.5 mm; average age 34.7+/-4.2 years).Water-soluble, water-insoluble, water-insoluble-urea-soluble protein fractions extracted samples. three-part protein fractions individual lenses combined form total proteins sample. proteomic profiles group analyzed using 8-plex isobaric tagging relative absolute protein quantification (iTRAQ) labeling combined two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS). data analyzed ProteinPilot software peptide matching, protein identification, quantification. Differentially expressed proteins validated western blotting. RESULTS: employed biological technical replicates selected intersection two sets results, included 40 proteins. 40 proteins identified, six selected differentially expressed proteins closely related axial length. six proteins gap junction alpha-3 protein, beta-crystallin B2, T-complex protein 1 subunit beta, gamma-enolase, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2, sorbitol dehydrogenase. Levels beta-crystallin B2 expression decreased nuclear cataracts longer axial length. results mass spectrometric analysis consistent western blot validation. CONCLUSION: discovery differentially expressed proteins provides valuable clues understanding pathogenesis axial-related nuclear cataract. results indicate beta-crystallin B2 (CRBB2) may involved axial-related nuclear cataract pathogenesis. studies needed investigate correlation CRBB2 axial-related nuclear cataract.
