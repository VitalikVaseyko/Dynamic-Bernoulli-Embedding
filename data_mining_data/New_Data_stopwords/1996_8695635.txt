 three main existing models glycolytic oscillations yeast re-examined investigate oscillations controlled. implemented operational definitions provided metabolic control analysis quantify control properties enzymes regard glycolytic oscillations. three models, control frequency amplitudes metabolites distributed among enzymes. obvious correlation control average flax control frequency. importantly, so-called 'oscillophore' system, traditionally enzyme primarily held responsible generation oscillation, controlling step. conclude like steady-state flux control necessarily limited rate-limiting step, oscillations dictated single 'oscillophore'.
