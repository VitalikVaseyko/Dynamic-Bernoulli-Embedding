 17-kDa endogenous brain protein glia maturation factor (GMF) transfected C6 rat glioma cells using replication-defective human adenovirus vector. cells overexpressed GMF secrete protein medium. Transfection GMF led activation transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), evidenced electrophoretic mobility shift assay nuclear extract, using double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing consensus binding sequence NF-kappaB. specificity binding demonstrated competition unlabeled probe nonbinding mutant probe. Binding detectable early 3 h transfection, peaked 6 12 h, gradually declined thereafter. observed NF-kappaB activation reduced cotransfection catalase presence high concentrations pyruvate medium, suggesting involvement H2O2. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB-203580 also suppressed GMF-activated NF-kappaB, suggesting involvement p38 signal transduction cascade. hand, phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activated NF-kappaB whether GMF overexpressed. Along NF-kappaB activation enhanced expression superoxide dismutase (SOD), suppressed NF-kappaB nuclear translocation blocked specific decoy DNA, implicating NF-kappaB upstream mediator antioxidant enzyme. p38 inhibitor SB-203580 also blocked GMF-activated SOD. NF-kappaB SOD pro-survival signals, results suggest cytoprotective role endogenous GMF glial cells.
