 absence glycolytic intermediate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, pyruvate kinase type K exists dimeric form readily phosphorylated, whereas sample conditions pyruvate kinase type present tetramer phosphorylated. Addition fructose-1,6-bisphosphate results association dimeric K2 molecules tetrameric K4 enzyme determined gel filtration cellulose acetate electrophoresis, concomitant loss capacity K isozyme become phosphorylated. Phosphorylated K2 dimers also tetramerize, low recovery radiolabel, suggesting fructose-1,6-bisphosphate induced dephosphorylation selective degradation. dimeric K isozyme enzymatically active; inactive K-type monomers detected immunoblot analysis absence fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, phosphorylated pyruvate kinase present fraction. formation K4 tetramers accomplished substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate allosteric activator pyruvate kinase type K induces hyperbolic saturation curves phosphoenolpyruvate. contrast, absence effectors, pyruvate kinase type exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics, sigmoidal curves induced amino acid phenylalanine. However, even presence phenylalanine, M-type maintained tetrameric configuration serve substrate phosphorylation reaction. findings argue importance subunit interaction regulation phosphorylation pyruvate kinase.
