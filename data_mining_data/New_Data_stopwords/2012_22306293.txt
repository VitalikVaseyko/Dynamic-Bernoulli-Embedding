 Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) glycolysis enzyme catalyzing conversion phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate transferring phosphate PEP ADP. report PKM2 localizes cell nucleus. levels nuclear PKM2 correlate cell proliferation. PKM2 activates transcription MEK5 phosphorylating stat3 Y705. vitro phosphorylation assays show PKM2 protein kinase using PEP phosphate donor. ADP competes protein substrate binding, indicating substrate may bind ADP site PKM2. experiments suggest PKM2 dimer active protein kinase, tetramer active pyruvate kinase. Expression PKM2 mutant exists dimer promotes cell proliferation, indicating protein kinase activity PKM2 plays role promoting cell proliferation. study reveals important link metabolism alteration gene expression tumor transformation progression.
