 Interactions glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (D-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9), aldolase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate lyase, EC 4.1.2.13), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1.2.1.12), triose-phosphate isomerase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.1), phosphoglycerate mutase (D-phosphoglycerate 2,3-phosphomutase, EC 5.4.2.1), phosphoglycerate kinase (ATP:3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.3), enolase (2-phospho-D-glycerate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.11), pyruvate kinase (ATP:Pyruvate O2-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) lactate dehydrogenase [S)-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27) F-actin, among glycolytic enzymes listed above, phosphofructokinase (ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) studied presence poly(ethylene glycol). purified rabbit muscle enzymes rabbit muscle myogen, high-speed supernatant fraction containing glycolytic enzymes, used study enzyme-F-actin interactions. Following ultracentrifugation, F-actin poly(ethylene glycol) tended increase KCl decrease pelleting enzymes. general, greater part pelleting occurred presence F-actin poly(ethylene glycol) absence KCl. Enzymes pelleted myogen preparations individual purified enzymes presence poly(ethylene glycol) absence F-actin tested specific enzyme-enzyme associations, several observed. interactions support view internal cell structure composed proteins interact one another form microtrabecular lattice.
