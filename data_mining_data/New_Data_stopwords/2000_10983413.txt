 Cytosolic pyruvate kinase (ATP: Pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40; PKc) purified apparent homogeneity 22% recovery developing seeds Brassica campestris using (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, gel filtration Sepharose-CL-6B affinity chromatography reactive Blue Sepharose-CL-6B. purified enzyme molecular mass 214 kDa heterotetramer subunit molecular mass 55 57 kDa. enzyme showed maximum activity pH 6.8 absolute requirement divalent (Mg2+) monovalent (K+) cation activity. Typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics obtained substrates Km values 0.10 0.11 mM PEP ADP, respectively. enzyme could also use UDP GDP alternative nucleotides, lower Vmax lesser affinities. enzyme inhibited glutamate, glutamine, fumarate, citrate, isocitrate, oxalate, 2-PGA, ATP, UTP GTP activated glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate Pi, suggesting regulation mainly TCA cycle intermediates cellular need carbon skeletons amino acid biosynthesis. ATP inhibition competitive type respect PEP non-competitive respect ADP. Similarly, oxalate inhibition also competitive type respect PEP non-competitive respect ADP. Initial velocity product inhibition studies except pyruvate inhibition consistent compulsory-ordered tri-bi mechanism.
