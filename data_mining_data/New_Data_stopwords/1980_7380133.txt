 isozyme patterns glycolytic enzymes Friend leukemia cells (FLC) compared erythrocytes erythroblasts. Erythrocyte-specific R types pyruvate kinase (PK) clearly observed phenylhydrazine-induced mouse erythroblast, much less amount also observed Friend leukemia cells. FLC induced differentiate hexamethylene-bisacetamide (HMBA), R types slightly reduced. induction differentiation inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), R types M2-R hybrids rather increased. results reverse obtained hemoglobin production used marker differentiation. Isozyme patterns lactic dehydrogenase aldolase change differentiation FLC induced HMBA, mouse erythroblasts erythrocytes.
