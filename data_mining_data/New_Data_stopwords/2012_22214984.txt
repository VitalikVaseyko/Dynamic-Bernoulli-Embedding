 Acetate kinase, member acetate sugar kinase-Hsp70-actin (ASKHA) enzyme superfamily, responsible reversible phosphorylation acetate acetyl phosphate utilizing ATP substrate. Acetate kinases ubiquitous Bacteria, found one genus Archaea, also present microbes Eukarya. well characterized acetate kinase methane-producing archaeon Methanosarcina thermophila. acetate kinase utilize PP(i) ATP acetyl phosphate-forming direction isolated Entamoeba histolytica, causative agent amoebic dysentery, thus far found genus. direction acetyl phosphate formation, acetate kinase activity typically measured using hydroxamate assay, first described Lipmann, coupled assay conversion ATP ADP coupled oxidation NADH NAD(+) enzymes pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, assay measuring release inorganic phosphate reaction acetyl phosphate product hydroxylamine. Activity opposite, acetate-forming direction measured coupling ATP formation ADP reduction NADP(+) NADPH enzymes hexokinase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. describe method detection acetate kinase activity direction acetate formation require coupling enzymes, instead based direct determination acetyl phosphate consumption. enzymatic reaction, remaining acetyl phosphate converted ferric hydroxamate complex measured spectrophotometrically, hydroxamate assay. Thus, unlike standard coupled assay direction dependent production ATP ADP, direct assay used acetate kinases produce ATP PP(i).
