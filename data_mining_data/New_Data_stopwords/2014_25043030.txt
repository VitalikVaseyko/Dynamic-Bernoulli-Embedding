 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), common form kidney cancer, characterized elevated glycogen levels fat deposition. consistent metabolic alterations associated normoxic stabilization hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) secondary von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations occur 90% ccRCC tumours. However, kidney-specific VHL deletion mice fails elicit ccRCC-specific metabolic phenotypes tumour formation, suggesting additional mechanisms essential. Recent large-scale sequencing analyses revealed loss several chromatin remodelling enzymes subset ccRCC (these included polybromo-1, SET domain containing 2 BRCA1-associated protein-1, among others), indicating epigenetic perturbations probably important contributors natural history disease. used integrative approach comprising pan-metabolomic profiling metabolic gene set analysis determined gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) uniformly depleted six hundred ccRCC tumours examined. Notably, human FBP1 locus resides chromosome 9q22, loss associated poor prognosis ccRCC patients. data indicate FBP1 inhibits ccRCC progression two distinct mechanisms. First, FBP1 antagonizes glycolytic flux renal tubular epithelial cells, presumptive ccRCC cell origin, thereby inhibiting potential Warburg effect. Second, pVHL (the protein encoded VHL gene)-deficient ccRCC cells, FBP1 restrains cell proliferation, glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway catalytic-activity-independent manner, inhibiting nuclear HIF function via direct interaction HIF inhibitory domain. unique dual function FBP1 protein explains ubiquitous loss ccRCC, distinguishing FBP1 previously identified tumour suppressors consistently mutated tumours.
