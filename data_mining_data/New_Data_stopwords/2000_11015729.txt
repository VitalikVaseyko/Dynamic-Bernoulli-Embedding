 Recombinant S. cerevisiae strains, elevated levels enzymes lower glycolysis (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase alcohol dehydrogenase) physiologically characterized. growth glucose enzyme levels recombinant strains (YHM4 YHM7) 1.1-3.4-fold higher host strain (CEN.PK.K45). recombinant strains grown aerobic anaerobic batch cultures glucose mixture glucose galactose. specific ethanol production rates recombinant strains host strain physiological behaviour recombinant strains host strain similar. cellular demand ATP increased means glucose pulses (final concentrations 3.9 g/l 2.0 g/l, respectively) aerobic chemostat cultures maintained dilution rate 0.08/h, specific carbon dioxide production rate (qCO(2)) CEN.PK.K45 accelerated 6x10(-3) mmol/g/min(2) first 15 min, whereas time period qCO(2) YHM7 accelerated twice fast 12x10(-3) mmol/g/min(2), indicating higher fermentative capacity recombinant strain.
