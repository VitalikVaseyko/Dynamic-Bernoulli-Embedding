 Conversion lactate glucose examined myotubes, minced muscle tissue, rats exposed 2H2O 13C-enriched substrates. Myotubes minced skeletal muscle incubated [U-(13)C3]lactate released small amounts [1,2,3-(13)C3]- [4,5,6-(13)C3]glucose. labeling pattern consistent direct transfer lactate glucose without randomization tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. exposure incubated muscle 2H2O, [U-(13)C3]lactate, glucose, glutamine, minimal release synthesized glucose medium based low level 2H enrichment medium glucose 50- 100-fold greater 2H enrichment glucosyl units glycogen. 13C enrichment pattern glycogen incubated skeletal muscle consistent direct transfer lactate glucose without exchange TCA cycle intermediates. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra glutamate tissue showed flux lactate pyruvate dehydrogenase flux pyruvate carboxylase TCA cycle. Carbon alternative substrate glucose production requires metabolism TCA cycle, propionate, enter glycogen, suggesting TCA cycle intermediates exchange phosphoenolpyruvate. vivo, 13C labeling patterns hepatic glycogen plasma glucose administration [U-(13)C3]lactate differ significantly. However, skeletal muscle glycogen substantially enriched [1,2,3-(13)C3]- [4,5,6-(13)C3]glucose units could occur skeletal muscle glyconeogenesis rather glycogenesis. Lactate serves substrate glyconeogenesis vivo without exchange symmetric intermediates TCA cycle.
