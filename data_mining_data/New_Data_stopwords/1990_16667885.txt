 Leucoplast pyruvate kinase endosperm developing castor oil seeds (Ricinus communis L.; cv Baker) purified 1370-fold specific activity 41.1 micromoles pyruvate produced per minute per milligram protein. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis purified enzyme resulted single protein staining band co-migrated pyruvate kinase activity. However, following sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis, two major protein staining bands 57.5 44 kilodaltons, occurred approximate 2:1 ratio, respectively, observed. native molecular mass approximately 305 kilodaltons. Rabbit antiserum raised final enzyme preparation effectively immunoprecipitated leucoplast pyruvate kinase. 57.5- 44-kilodalton polypeptides immunologically related proteins cross-reacted strongly Western blots probed rabbit anti-(developing castor seed endosperm leucoplast pyruvate kinase) immunoglobulin affinity-purified 57.5-kilodalton polypeptide. contrast, pyruvate kinases following sources showed immunological cross-reactivity immunoglobulin: cytosolic enzyme developing germinating castor bean endosperm; chloroplastic pyruvate kinase expanding leaves castor oil plant; chloroplastic cytosolic pyruvate kinase green alga, Selenastrum minutum; mammalian bacterial pyruvate kinases.
