 purpose present investigation assess possibility building model estimate, dystrophin western blotting analysis, expression DMD/BMD gene muscle heterozygotes. Dystrophin analysed mixing increasing proportions (from 0% 100%) aliquots solubilised muscle BMD patients qualitatively abnormal dystrophin normal male control. intensity abnormal bands, could detected starting 20% muscle BMD patient, increased progressively according affected muscle concentration. five obligate BMD carriers, two dystrophin bands observed (corresponding products X bearing normal BMD alleles), even among normal serum enzyme activities. Surprisingly, four obligate BMD carriers related patients additional dystrophin fragment 250 kd present (two raised serum enzymes), band could seen, suggesting stability mechanism responsible synthesis abnormal dystrophin products differs heterozygotes compared affected patients.
