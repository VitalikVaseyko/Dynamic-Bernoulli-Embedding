 investigated role mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number alteration human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). mtDNA copy numbers paired cancer non-cancer parts five resected RCC kidneys radical nephrectomy determined quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). RCC cell line, 786-O, infected lentiviral particles knock mitochondrial transcriptional factor (TFAM). Null target (NT) TFAM-knockdown (TFAM-KD) represented control knockdown 786-O clones, respectively. Protein mRNA expression levels TFAM; mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), ND6 cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (COX-2); nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded succinate dehydrogenase subunit (SDHA); v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 gene (AKT)-encoded AKT v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog gene (c-MYC)-encoded MYC; glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase II (HK-II), glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactate dehydrogenase subunit (LDHA); hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha HIF-2alpha, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component alpha subunit (PDHA1) analyzed Western blot Q-PCR. Bioenergetic parameters cellular metabolism, basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (mOCRB) basal extracellular acidification rate (ECARB), measured Seahorse XF(e)-24 analyzer. Cell invasiveness evaluated trans-well migration assay vimentin expression. Doxorubicin used chemotherapeutic agent. results showed decrease mtDNA copy numbers resected RCC tissues (p = 0.043). TFAM-KD clone expressed lower mtDNA copy number (p = 0.034), lower mRNA levels TFAM (p = 0.008), ND1 (p = 0.007), ND6 (p = 0.017), lower protein levels TFAM COX-2 NT clone. contrast, protein levels HIF-2alpha, HK-II, PFK, LDHA, AKT, MYC vimentin; trans-well migration activity (p = 0.007); drug resistance doxorubicin (p = 0.008) TFAM-KD clone significantly higher NT clone. Bioenergetically, TFAM-KD clone expressed lower mOCRB (p = 0.009) higher ECARB (p = 0.037) NT clone. conclude reduction mtDNA copy number decrease respiratory function mitochondria RCC might compensated increase enzymes factors involved upregulation glycolysis confer RCC invasive drug-resistant phenotype vitro.
