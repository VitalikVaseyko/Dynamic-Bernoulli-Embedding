 Somatic cell nuclear transfer valuable technique generation genetically engineered animals, however, efficiency cloning mammalian species low (1-3%). Differentiated somatic cells commonly used nuclear transfer utilize tricarboxylic acid cycle cellular respiration energy production. Comparatively metabolism somatic cells contrasts cells within early embryos predominately use glycolysis. Early embryos (prior implantation) evidenced exhibit characteristics Warburg Effect (WE)-like metabolism. hypothesized pharmacologically driven fibroblast cells become blastomere-like result improved vitro embryonic development SCNT. goals determine subsequent vitro embryo development impacted (1) cloning pharmacologically treated donor cells pushed WE-like metabolism (2) culturing non-treated donor clones pharmaceuticals used push WE-like metabolism. Additionally, investigated early gestational survival donor-treated clone embryos. demonstrate vitro development clones hindered pharmacologically treating either donor cells embryos CPI, PS48, combination drugs. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate early embryos (or least vitro produced embryos) low proportion mitochondria high membrane potential treatment pharmaceuticals alter mitochondrial function early embryos. Lastly, show survival early gestation different clones pharmacologically induced WE-like donor cells controls.
