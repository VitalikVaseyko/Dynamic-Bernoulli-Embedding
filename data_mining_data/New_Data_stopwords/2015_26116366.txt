 well-established fact tumors up-regulate glucose consumption meet increasing demands rapidly available energy upregulating purely glycolytic mode glucose metabolism. often neglected activated cytotoxic cells immune system, integral players carcinogenesis process, also come rely glycolysis primary mode glucose metabolism. Moreover, cancer cells revert back aerobic metabolism, rapidly proliferating cytotoxic lymphocytes incapable performing function adequate resources lacking. Consequently, likely tumor microenvironment may exist competition shared resources cancer cells cells immune system, may underlie much tumor-immune dynamics. Proposed model tumor-immune-glucose interactions, formulated predator-prey-common resource type system. outcome interactions ranges tumor elimination, tumor dormancy, unrestrained tumor growth. also predicted process tumor escape preceded periods oscillatory tumor growth. detailed bifurcation analysis three subsystems model suggest oscillatory regimes result competition shared resource (glucose) predator (immune cells) prey (cancer cells). Existence competition nutrients cancer immune cells may provide additional mechanistic insight efficacy many immunotherapies may limited.
