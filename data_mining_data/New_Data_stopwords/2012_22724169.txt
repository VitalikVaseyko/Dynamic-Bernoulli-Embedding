 Growth performance metabolism investigated mink kits (n = 210) exposed dietary treatment dams (n = 30), i.e. high (HP; 61% metabolisable energy, ME), medium (MP; 48% ME) low (LP; 30% ME) protein supply, birth 10 weeks age. kits weighed weekly, measured means balance experiment indirect calorimetry, weeks eight nine post-partum (p.p.). weaning (seven weeks p.p.) 10 weeks p.p. one kit per litter killed blood, liver kidneys collected. Plasma amino acid profiles, hepatic abundance mRNA phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructose 1,6-biphosphatase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) q-PCR, determined. differences live weights among kits first four weeks life kits solely consumed milk, male LP kits heaviest. transition solid feed MP kits weighed nine weeks age (p < 0.05). eight weeks age, kits fed LP diet retained less (p < 0.05) N HP MP kits. Heat production differ among kits, although protein oxidation higher (p < 0.001) HP kits LP kits. Kits fed LP diet lower (p < 0.05) plasma concentrations lysine, methionine leucine MP kits. Dietary treatment reflected relative abundance studied mRNAs, kits significantly lower abundance studied mRNA dams, ranging 83% less PEPCK abundance 40% less G-6-Pase. kidney mass smallest (p < 0.01) kits fed LP diet, liver masses largest (p < 0.001) HP kits. results indicate LP diet meet protein requirements mink kits transition period milk solid feed. capacity regulate rate gluconeogenesis even limited young mink kits adult dams. However, young mink kits regulate protein oxidation response dietary protein supply, probably adapting size liver kidneys level protein supply.
