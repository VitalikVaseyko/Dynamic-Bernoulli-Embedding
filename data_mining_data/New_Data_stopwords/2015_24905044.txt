 Shikimate key intermediate synthesis neuraminidase inhibitors. Microbial production shikimate related derivatives benefit cost reduction compared traditional methods. study, overproducing shikimate Escherichia coli strain developed rationally engineering certain metabolic pathways. achieve this, shikimate pathway blocked deletion shikimate kinases quinic acid/shikimate dehydrogenase. EIICB(glc) protein involved phosphotransferase system, acetic acid pathway also removed increase amount available phosphoenolpyruvate decrease byproduct formation, respectively. Thereafter, three critical enzymes mutated 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase (encoded aroG(fbr)), PEP synthase (encoded ppsA), transketolase (encoded tktA) modularly overexpressed resulting recombinant strain produced 1207 mg/L shikimate shake flask cultures. Using fed-batch process, 14.6g/L shikimate yield 0.29 g/g glucose generated 7-L bioreactor.
