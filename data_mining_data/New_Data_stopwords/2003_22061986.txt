 Within project aimed studying peptide fraction dry-cured Parma hams, peptide purified means reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) identified molecular mass amino acid sequence analysis. peptide showed high degree homology N-terminal part different mammalian pyruvate kinases reported databases accordingly identified N-terminal part swine pyruvate kinase, whose sequence never reported before. peptide determined quantitatively comparison suitable internal standard (Phe-Phe) commercial ham samples different age degrees. peptide found ubiquitous Parma ham amount increase ageing even large variability found within assayed maturing time. correlation found ham proteolysis degree (P<0.01) suggests peptide related endopeptidasic activity. peptide show significant relationship bitterness perception assayed dry-cured ham, agreement hypothesis taste related free amino acids low molecular weight peptides.
