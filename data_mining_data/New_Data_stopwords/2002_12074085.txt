 fermentation process developed production indigo glucose using recombinant Escherichia coli. achieved modifying tryptophan pathway cause high-level indole production adding Pseudomonas putida genes encoding naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO). comparison tryptophan-over-producing strain, first indigo-producing strain made less half expected amount indigo. Severe inactivation first enzyme aromatic biosynthesis, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase (the aroGfbr gene product), observed cells collected indigo fermentations. Subsequent vitro experiments revealed DAHP synthase inactivated exposure spontaneous chemical conversion indoxyl indigo. Indigo production thereafter improved increasing gene dosage aroGfbr increasing substrate availability DAHP synthase vivo either amplifying tktA (transketolase) gene inactivating isozymes pyruvate kinase. combining three strategies enhancing DAHP formation cell, 60% increase indigo production achieved. Metabolic engineering applied eliminate byproduct spontaneous conversion indoxyl indigo, thereby solving serious problem use bio-indigo final denim dyeing application.
