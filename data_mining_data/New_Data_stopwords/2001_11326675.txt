 Pyruvate kinase one glycolytic key enzymes. exists various isoforms expressed different cell types. One isoforms, type Tu M2-PK, strongly overexpressed tumor cells released body fluids. concentration Tu M2-PK body fluids quantitatively determined commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-kit. Tu M2-PK concentration measured EDTA-plasma 116 patients renal carcinoma 42 patients suffering nephritis, using kit. ranges Tu M2-PK-concentrations two groups overlap, indicating highly significant discrimination renal carcinoma benign renal diseases. Furthermore, Tu M2-PK concentration EDTA-plasma correlated strongly Robson tumor stage 116 patients. present results indicated Tu M2-PK might first tumor marker, could excellent complementation diagnostic program renal carcinoma.
