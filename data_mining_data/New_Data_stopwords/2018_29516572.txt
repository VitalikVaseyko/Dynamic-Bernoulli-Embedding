 Cancer cells metabolize glucose mainly glycolysis well adapted metabolic stress. Pim1 oncogene promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) growth metastasis, expression positively correlated CRC progression. However, mechanism underlying Pim1 overexpression CRC progression role Pim1 CRC metabolism remains unclear. study, discovered Pim1 expression significantly upregulated response glucose deprivation-induced metabolic stress via AMPK signaling. Pim1 promoted CRC cell proliferation vitro tumorigenicity vivo. Clinical observations demonstrated Pim1 expression higher CRC tissues adjacent normal tissues. Pim1 overexpression CRC tissues predicted CRC prognosis patients also exhibited positive relationship (18) F-FDG uptake. vitro experiments demonstrated Pim1 promoted Warburg effect Pim1 expression positively correlated HK2 LDHA expression. Pim1-silenced cells vulnerable glucose starvation, Pim1 induced tumor proliferation tolerance glucose starvation attenuated block Warburg effect. conclusion, glucose deprivation one mechanisms lead elevated Pim1 expression CRC, Pim1 upregulation ensures CRC growth response glucose deprivation facilitating Warburg effect compensatory manner. article protected copyright. rights reserved.
