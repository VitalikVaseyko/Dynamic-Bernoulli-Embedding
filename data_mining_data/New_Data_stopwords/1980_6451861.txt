 activities red cell enzymes enolase (ENO), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), hexokinase (HK), aldolase (ALD), pyruvate kinase (PK) followed sequentially term infants birth one year age. birth, red cell PGK ENO activities disproportionately elevated compared red cells similar mean cell age younger mean cell age; red cell PFK significantly decreased. progressive full PGK ENO activities rise PFK levels toward normal values first year life. significant changes PGK, ENO, PFK appeared begin 8 9 wk age. ENO PFK activities stabilized approximately 5 6 months age values compatible mean cell age; mean PGK levels remained mildly elevated 11 12 months. age-dependent enzymes G-6-PD, PK, ALD, HK elevated term newborns. G-6-PD ALD progressively decreased activity first year life. PK HK decreased activity 8 9 wk secondary rise mean activity. Mean red cell G-6-PD, PK, ALD, HK levels remained mildly moderately elevated 11 12 months life, suggesting persistence relatively young red cell population throughout first year life.
