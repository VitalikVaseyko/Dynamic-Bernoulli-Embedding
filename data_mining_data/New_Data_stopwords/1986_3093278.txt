 expression regulation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene grossly modified feeding rats 3'-methyl-4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene-containing diet despite maximum expression L-type pyruvate kinase gene dramatically reduced early 24th hour carcinogenic diet. Inhibition aldolase B mRNA synthesis occurred slowly, maximum 3rd day. stopping administration carcinogen, rapid, transient increase L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA observed 24th hour, whereas aldolase B mRNA increased slowly. amount aldolase mRNA fell quickly termination carcinogen administration, levels normal 2nd-3rd day. time, histological structure liver indistinguishable animals still receiving azo-dye diet. appears, therefore, rat administration withdrawal azo-dye carcinogen induce rapid modifications expression genes, cellular modification distinguishable.
