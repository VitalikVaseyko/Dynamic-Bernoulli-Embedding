 Accumulating epidemiological studies implicated strong link age associated metabolic diseases cancer, though direct irrefutable evidence missing. review, discuss connection Warburg effects tumorigenesis, well adaptive responses environment circadian rhythms molecular pathways involved metabolism. also review central role sirtuin family proteins physiological modulation cellular processes age-associated metabolic diseases. also provide macroscopic view circadian rhythm affects metabolism may involved cell metabolism reprogramming cancer pathogenesis. aberrations metabolism circadian system may lead age-associated diseases directly intermediates. intermediates may either mutated reprogrammed, thus becoming responsible chromatin modification oncogene transcription. Integration circadian rhythm metabolic reprogramming holistic understanding metabolic diseases cancer may provide additional insights human diseases.
