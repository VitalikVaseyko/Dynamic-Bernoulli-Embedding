 Fo.F1-ATP synthase inside-out coupled vesicles derived Paracoccus denitrificans catalyzes Pi-dependent proton-translocating ATPase reaction exposed prior energization relieves ADP.Mg2+ -induced inhibition (Zharova, T.V. Vinogradov, A.D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem.,279, 12319-12324). present evidence presence medium ADP required steady-state energetically self-sustained coupled ATP hydrolysis. initial rapid ATPase activity declined certain level reaction proceeds presence ADP-consuming, ATP-regenerating system (pyruvate kinase/phosphoenol pyruvate). rate extent enzyme de-activation inversely proportional steady-state ADP concentration, altered various amounts pyruvate kinase constant ATPase level. half-maximal rate stationary ATP hydrolysis reached ADP concentration 8 x 10(-6) M. kinetic scheme proposed explaining requirement reaction products (ADP Pi), substrates ATP synthesis, medium proton-translocating ATP hydrolysis P. denitrificans Fo.F1-ATP synthase.
