 heart sugar-induced hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) rats, cardiac performance impaired glucose fuel, fatty acids. Accordingly, glycolytic flux transfer energy diminish HTG heart, comparison control heart. explore biochemical nature alteration HTG heart, components non-glycolytic energy systems involved evaluated. Total creatine kinase (CK) activity myocardial tissue depressed 30% HTG heart whereas activity mitochondrial CK (mitCK) isoenzyme fraction functionally associated oxidative phosphorylation decreased isolated HTG heart mitochondria 45%. Adenylate kinase (AK) 20% lower HTG heart. contrast, respiratory rates 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) pyruvate/malate (pyr) significantly higher HTG heart mitochondria control mitochondria. 2-OG dehydrogenase activity also higher HTG mitochondria. Respiration succinate similar groups. Content cytochromes b, c + c1 + a3, cytochrome c oxidase activity, also similar two kinds mitochondria. larger content saturated monounsaturated fatty acids found HTG mitochondrial membranes changes phospholipids composition cholesterol content. Mitochondrial membranes HTG hearts rigid, correlated generation higher membrane potentials. mitochondrial function preserved even enhanced HTG heart, results indicated deficiency energy transfer associated impairment mitCK AK. situation brought uncoupling site ATP production site ATP consumption (contractile machinery), spite compensatory increase mitochondrial oxidative capacity membrane potential generation.
