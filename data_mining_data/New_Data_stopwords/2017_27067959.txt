 Currently available enzymatic methods measurement glycated proteins utilize fructosyl amino acid/peptide oxidases (FAOXs/FPOXs) sensing elements. FAOXs/FPOXs oxidize glycated amino acids glycated dipeptides able accept longer glycated peptides intact glycated proteins substrates. Therefore, pretreatment via proteolytic digestion unavoidable current enzymatic methods, remains need simpler measurement methods glycated proteins. study, order develop novel sensing system glycated albumin (GA), marker diabetes, requirement proteolytic digestion, created electrochemical sensor based fructosamine 6-kinase (FN6K) Escherichia coli. Uniquely, FN6K react directly intact GA unlike FAOXs/FPOXs. concentration GA samples measured using carbon-printed disposable electrode upon FN6K well two additional enzymes, pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase overlaid. clear correlation response current concentration GA observed range 20-100 microM GA, suitable measurement GA diluted blood samples healthy individuals patients diabetes. sensing system reported could applied point-of-care-testing devices measurement glycated proteins.
