 OBJECTIVE: Chronic activation nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) white adipose tissue leads increased production pro-inflammatory cytokines, involved development insulin resistance. presently unknown whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) beta/delta activation prevents inflammation adipocytes. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS RESULTS: First, examined whether PPARbeta/delta agonist GW501516 prevents lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine production differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment GW501516 blocked LPS-induced IL-6 expression secretion adipocytes subsequent activation signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3)-Suppressor cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) pathway. effect associated capacity GW501516 impede LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation. Second, vivo studies, white adipose tissue Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, compared lean rats, showed reduced PPARbeta/delta expression PPAR DNA-binding activity, accompanied enhanced IL-6 expression NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, IL-6 expression NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity higher white adipose tissue PPARbeta/delta-null mice wild-type mice. mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 (MEK1/2) involved LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation adipocytes, explored whether PPARbeta/delta prevented NF-kappaB activation inhibiting pathway. Interestingly, GW501516 prevented ERK1/2 phosphorylation LPS. Furthermore, white adipose tissue animal showing constitutively increased NF-kappaB activity, ZDF rats PPARbeta/delta-null mice, also showed enhanced phospho-ERK1/2 levels. CONCLUSIONS: findings indicate activation PPARbeta/delta inhibits enhanced cytokine production adipocytes preventing NF-kappaB activation via ERK1/2, effect may help prevent insulin resistance.
