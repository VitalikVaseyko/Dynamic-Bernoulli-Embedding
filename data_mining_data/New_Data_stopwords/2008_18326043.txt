 previously reported cytosolic pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) Toxoplasma gondii (TgPyKI) differs eukaryotic pyruvate kinases regulated glucose 6-phosphate rather fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Another putative pyruvate kinase (TgPyKII) identified parasite genome, exhibits 32% amino acid sequence identity TgPyKI retains pyruvate kinase signature motifs amino acids essential substrate binding catalysis. Whereas TgPyKI closely related plant/algal enzymes, phylogenetic analysis suggests proteobacterial origin TgPyKII. Enzymatic characterization recombinant TgPyKII shows high pH optimum 8.5, preference GDP phosphate recipient. Catalytic activity independent K+, allosteric regulatory effects observed presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate, fructose 2,6-diphosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, AMP, ATP. Unlike TgPyKI, native TgPyKII activity exclusively associated membranous fraction T. gondii tachyzoite lysate. TgPyKII possesses long N-terminal extension containing five putative start codons conserved region localizes apicoplast mitochondrion immunofluorescence assay using native antibody fluorescent protein fusion N-terminal extension. deletional site-directed mutagenesis suggests translation product 1st Met responsible localization apicoplast, whereas one 3rd Met mitochondrion. first study potential mitochondrial pyruvate kinase system.
