 Many factors known influence oligomerization, fibrillation, amyloid formation Abeta peptide associated Alzheimer disease. proteins present Abeta peptides deposit vivo likely effect aggregation processes. separate specific versus broad spectrum effects proteins Abeta aggregation, tested series proteins reported chaperone activity: catalase, pyruvate kinase, albumin, lysozyme, alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin. tested proteins suppressed fibrillation Alzheimer Abeta(1-40) peptide substoichiometric ratios, albeit effectively others. proteins bound non-specifically Abeta, stabilized random coils, reduced cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, pyruvate kinase catalase least effective known chaperones inhibiting Abeta aggregation. propose general mechanisms broad-spectrum inhibition Abeta fibrillation proteins. mechanisms discuss significant prognostics perhaps even prevention treatment Alzheimer disease.
