 activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents aggressive human lymphoma entity. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation caused chronic active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling common feature many ABC DLBCL cells; however, pathways linking BCR signaling NF-kappaB prosurvival network largely unknown. report constitutive activity PI3K downstream kinase PDK1 essential viability two ABC DLBCL cell lines carry mutations BCR proximal signaling adaptor CD79B. cells, PI3K inhibition reduces NF-kappaB activity decreases expression NF-kappaB target genes. Furthermore, PI3K PDK1 required maintaining MALT1 protease activity, promotes survival affected ABC DLBCL cells. results demonstrate critical function PI3K-PDK1 signaling upstream MALT1 protease NF-kappaB distinct ABC DLBCL cells provide rationale pharmacologic use PI3K inhibitors DLBCL therapy.
