 OBJECTIVE: Fat depots thermogenic activity identified humans. mice, appearance thermogenic adipocytes within white adipose depots (so-called brown-in-white i.e., brite beige adipocytes) protects obesity insulin resistance. Brite adipocytes may originate direct conversion white adipocytes. purpose work characterize metabolism human brite adipocytes. METHODS: Human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells differentiated white adipocytes treated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma PPARalpha agonists day 14 day 18. Gene expression profiling determined using DNA microarrays RT-qPCR. Variations mRNA levels confirmed differentiated human preadipocytes primary cultures. Fatty acid glucose metabolism investigated using radiolabelled tracers, Western blot analyses assessment oxygen consumption. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) knockdown achieved using siRNA. vivo, wild type PPARalpha-null mice treated beta3-adrenergic receptor agonist (CL316,243) induce appearance brite adipocytes white fat depot. Determination mRNA protein levels performed inguinal white adipose tissue. RESULTS: PPAR agonists promote conversion white adipocytes cells displaying brite molecular pattern. conversion associated transcriptional changes leading major metabolic adaptations. Fatty acid anabolism i.e., fatty acid esterification triglycerides, catabolism i.e., lipolysis fatty acid oxidation, increased. Glucose utilization redirected oxidation towards glycerol-3-phophate production triglyceride synthesis. metabolic shift dependent activation PDK4 inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. vivo, PDK4 expression markedly induced wild-type mice response CL316,243, increase blunted PPARalpha-null mice displaying impaired britening response. CONCLUSIONS: Conversion human white fat cells brite adipocytes results major metabolic reprogramming inducing fatty acid anabolic catabolic pathways. PDK4 redirects glucose oxidation towards triglyceride synthesis favors use fatty acids energy source uncoupling mitochondria.
