 Cancer-initiating cells (CICs) responsible tumor initiation, progression, therapeutic resistance; moreover, redox homeostasis important regulating cancer stemness. Previously, identified cancer cells containing low intracellular reactive oxygen species levels (ROS(Low) cells) display enhanced features CICs. However, specific metabolic signatures CICs remain unclear required characterization systemic screenings. Herein, first showed CICs mainly relying glycolysis important maintenance stemness properties. Next, revealed NRF2, master regulator antioxidants, able maintain low intracellular ROS levels CICs, even though absence oxidative stress. characterized NRF2 activation required maintenance CICs properties. ROS(Low) cells, NRF2 activation directly activates transcription genes encoding glycolytic enzymes also inhibited conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA directly activating pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) lead inhibition tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; therefore, promote Warburg effect. positive regulatory ROS-independent ER stress pathway (GRP78/p-PERK/NRF2 signaling) identified mediate metabolic shift (Warburg effect) stemness CICs. Lastly, co-expression p-PERK p-NRF2 significantly associated clinical outcome. data show NRF2 acting central node maintenance low ROS levels stemness associated properties CICs, significantly associated clinical outcome, independent ROS stress. Future treatments inhibiting NRF2 activation may exhibit great potential targeting CICs.
