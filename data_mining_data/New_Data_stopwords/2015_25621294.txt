 Cancer cells acquire unusual glycolytic behavior relative, large extent, intracellular alkaline pH (pHi). effect part metabolic alterations found most, all, cancer cells deal unfavorable conditions, mainly hypoxia low nutrient supply, order preserve evolutionary trajectory production lactate ten steps glycolysis. Thus, cancer cells reprogram cellular metabolism way gives evolutionary thermodynamic advantage. Tumors exist within highly heterogeneous microenvironment cancer cells survive within different habitats lie within tumors thanks overexpression different membrane-bound proton transporters. creates highly abnormal selective proton reversal cancer cells tissues involved local cancer growth metastatic process. environmental heterogeneity, cancer cells within one part tumor may different genotype phenotype within another part. phenomenon frustrated potential single-target therapy type reductionist therapeutic approach last decades. Here, present detailed biochemical framework every step tumor glycolysis proposea new paradigm therapeutic strategy based upon dynamics hydrogen ion cancer cells tissues order overcome old paradigm one enzyme-one target approach cancer treatment. Finally, new integral explanation Warburg effect advanced.
