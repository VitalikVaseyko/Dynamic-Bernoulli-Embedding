 role protein kinases renal noradrenergic stimulation examined using sphingosine, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperizine (H7), using sphingosine, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperizine (H7), staurosporine inhibit responses norepinephrine (NE, 60 nM) isolated perfused rat kidneys. Sphingosine (20 mumol/L) increased noradrenergic vasoconstrictor response. H7 (10 mumol/L) partially blocked immediate vasoconstrictor response completely inhibited 2 min without altering antinatriuretic antilithuretic responses. H7 also blocked increase free water produced NE, consistent inhibition protein kinase linked beta-adrenergic stimulation. Staurosporine (10 nmol/L) partially inhibited noradrenergic vasoconstriction antinatriuresis, completely blocked depression gluconeogenic responses NE pyruvate-perfused kidneys. examine role diacylglycerol protein kinase C renal responses NE, used oleoyl-acetyl-glycerol (OAG, 50-100 microM) phorbol-12-myristyl-13-acetate (TPA, 5-50 nM). TPA slowly vasoconstricted kidney reduced GFR fractional Na+, Li+, free water excretion. Amiloride (1 mM) prevented TPA responses. OAG mimicked effects TPA except vasoconstriction occurred rapidly brief. TPA OAG acted like alpha 1-adrenergic agonists. results indicate diaclyglycerol protein kinase involved prolonged effects NE vasoconstriction. GFR, proximal tubular reabsorption.
