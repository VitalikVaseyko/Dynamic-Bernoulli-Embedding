 Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) inner mitochondrial membrane transporter often upregulated human cancers. However, anion transporter affects tumorigenesis well understood. Using skin cell transformation JB6 model, demonstrated UCP2 overexpression activated phosphofructokinase 2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2), key regulator glycolysis. conjunction, upregulation PFKFB2 expression correlated elevated fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) levels, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) activity, glucose uptake, lactate production. Inhibiting PFKFB2 expression suppressed UCP2-mediated skin cell transformation, decreased cell proliferation, enhanced mitochondrial respiration, dampening aerobic glycolysis. AKT signaling pathway activated UCP2 overexpressed cells; furthermore, activated AKT signaling contributed activation PFKFB2. Whereas AKT inactivation blocked PFKFB2 activation, suggesting AKT activation important step PFKFB2 activation. Collectively, data suggest UCP2 critical regulator cellular metabolism cell transformation. data also demonstrate potentially novel mechanism understand UCP2's tumor-promoting role, AKT-dependent activation PFKFB2 thereby, metabolic shift glycolysis (the Warburg effect).
