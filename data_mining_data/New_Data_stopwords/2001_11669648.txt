 multiligand interactions governing allosteric response Mg(2+)-activated yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK) steady-state turnover quantitated kinetic linked-function analysis. substrate, PEP, enzyme-bound divalent metal, Mg(2+), allosteric effector, FBP, positively influence other's interaction enzyme presence saturating concentrations second substrate, MgADP. presence Mg(2+) enhances interaction PEP FBP YPK -2.0 -1.0 kcal/mol, respectively. simultaneous interaction PEP, Mg(2+), FBP YPK favored -4.1 kcal/mol sum independent binding free energies. coupling free energies measured Mg(2+)-activated YPK weaker corresponding coupling free energies measured Mn(2+)-activated YPK [Mesecar, A., Nowak, T. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 6792, 6803], consistent results thermodynamic measurements Mg(2+)-YPK complex [Bollenbach, T. J., Nowak, T. (2001) Biochemistry 36, 13088-13096]. comparison ligand binding data measured kinetic thermodynamic linked-function analyses reveals MgADP complex modulates binding three ligands two- three-ligand coupling interactions three ligands. Enzyme-bound Mg(2+) influence homotropic cooperativity PEP binding YPK. MgADP complex induces homotropic cooperativity PEP binding. enzyme-bound Mn(2+) induces homotropic binding PEP Mn(2+)-activated YPK. results lend support hypothesis divalent metals modulate interactions ligands YPK divalent metals play role regulation glycolytic pathway.
