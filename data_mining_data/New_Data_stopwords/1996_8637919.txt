 Mapping insertion points 16 signature-tagged transposon mutants Salmonella typhimurium chromosome led identification 40-kb virulence gene cluster minute 30.7. locus conserved among Salmonella species examined present variety pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli K-12. Nucleotide sequencing portion locus revealed 11 open reading frames whose predicted proteins encode components type III secretion system. distinguish type III secretion system encoded inv/spa invasion locus known reside pathogenicity island, refer inv/spa locus Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) 1 new locus SPI2. SPI2 lower G+C content remainder Salmonella genome flanked genes whose products share greater 90% identity E. coli ydhE pykF genes. Thus SPI2 probably acquired horizontally insertion region corresponding ydhE pykF genes E. coli. Virulence studies SPI2 mutants shown attenuated least five orders magnitude compared wild-type strain oral intraperitoneal inoculation mice.
