 Genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats show oral glucose intolerance, alteration attributed least part impaired suppression hepatic glucose output ingestion glucose. work, studied influence different concentrations glucose (2.5-30 mM) gluconeogenesis mixture [14C]lactate-pyruvate well fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, pyruvate kinase activity, flux reaction catalyzed 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, hepatocytes isolated fed obese (fa/fa) lean (Fa/-) rats. hepatocytes isolated lean rats, incubation increasing concentrations glucose caused dose-dependent inhibition gluconeogenesis (5.02 +/- 0.54 1.82 +/- 0.33 mumol lactate converted glucose/g cells.20 min hepatocytes incubated presence 2.5 30 mM glucose, respectively; n = 4 experiments; P < 0.01) together significant elevation fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content stimulation flux 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase reaction. Glucose also provoked dose-dependent activation pyruvate kinase absence changes cellular concentration cAMP. liver cells obese animals, gluconeogenesis significantly modified raising glucose concentration incubation medium (1.26 +/- 0.11 0.83 +/- 0.14 mumol lactate converted glucose/g cells.20 min hepatocytes incubated 2.5 30 mM glucose, respectively; n = 4 experiments; P = 0.11) despite significant increases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels flux 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase reaction. cells, pyruvate kinase slightly activated high glucose concentrations. results indicate that, unlike fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels flux 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase reaction, hepatic gluconeogenesis unresponsive high glucose concentrations genetically obese (fa/fa) rats.
