 Fas ligand (CD95L) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) pivotal inducers hepatocyte apoptosis. Uncontrolled activation two systems involved several forms liver injury. Although broad antiapoptotic action Bcl-2 Bcl-xL clearly established various apoptotic pathways, ability inhibit Fas/CD95- TNF-alpha-mediated apoptotic signal remained controversial. demonstrated expression BCL-2 hepatocytes protects Fas-induced fulminant hepatitis transgenic mice. present study shows transgenic mice overexpressing BCL-XL hepatocytes also protected Fas-induced apoptosis dose-dependent manner. Bcl-xL Bcl-2 protective without change level endogenous Bcl-xL Bax inhibited hepatic caspase-3-like activity. vivo injection TNF-alpha caused massive apoptosis death transcription inhibited. conditions, PK-BCL-XL mice partially protected liver injury death PK-BCL-2 mice not. similar differential protective effect Bcl-xL Bcl-2 transgenes observed Fas/CD95 activated transcription blocked. results suggest apoptosis triggered activation Fas/CD95 TNF-alpha receptors extent counteracted transcription-dependent protective effects, essential antiapoptotic activity Bcl-2 Bcl-xL. Therefore, Bcl-xL Bcl-2 appear different antiapoptotic effects liver whose characterization could facilitate use prevent uncontrolled apoptosis hepatocytes.
