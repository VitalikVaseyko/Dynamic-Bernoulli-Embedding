 Albino rats Wistar family raised normobaric hypoxic environment (10% O2 N2) since one two generations showed increase arterial blood creatine-kinase, glutamate-dehydrogenase, lactic-dehydrogenase, lactate pyruvate compared normoxic controls. Moreover values found hypoxic rats second generation intermediate found hypoxic rats first generation normoxic controls. differences probably due improved efficiency processes cellular adaptation hypoxic environment named species remain hypoxic environment one generation.
