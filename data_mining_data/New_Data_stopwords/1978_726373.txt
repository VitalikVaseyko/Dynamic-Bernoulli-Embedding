 influence alimentary deficiency thiamine pyruvate metabolism liver blood rats investigated. Note taken fallen activity pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) rising level pyruvate blood liver. inverse relationship PDH activity pyruvate content liver, observed whole course experiment evidence, although substrate level exceeds significantly control starting 20th day. normalization pyruvate level liver studied enzymatic systems partake; join stagewise order alanine-aminotransferase, pyruvate-kinase, malate-enzyme, differently change activity course experiment, along physiological mechanisms pyruvate transport blood. pronounced starting 20th day (inverse relationships pyruvate levels blood liver). whole experiment direct relation lactate content blood liver persists. tissues relation pyruvate lactate levels revealed.
