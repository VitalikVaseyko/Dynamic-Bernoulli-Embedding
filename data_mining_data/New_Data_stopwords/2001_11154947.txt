 specific activity kinetic properties partly purified pyruvate kinase (PK) (EC 2.7.1.40) Northern Krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, investigated relation varying food resources. order evaluate effect starvation total energy metabolism, respiration rates fed unfed krill determined. FPLC-elution profile PK displayed two distinct peaks - PK II. first isoform represented 80% total PK activity organism, 20% contributed second isoform. PK inhibited ATP influenced fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). contrast, PK II showed ATP inhibition 2.5-fold increased activity addition 17 micromol.l(-1) FBP. Michaelis-Menten constants isoforms 2-10-fold higher ADP phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Alanine showed regulatory effect PK II. specimens starved 7 days oxygen consumption decreased 20%. Neither feeding experiments animals captured field low high productive seasons indicate PK properties M. norvegica modified relation food supply. Accordingly, alternative mechanisms involved depression metabolic rate terms oxygen consumption.
