 Genetic ablation adenylate kinase 1 (AK1), member AK family phosphotransfer enzymes, disturbs muscle energetic economy decreases tolerance metabolic stress, despite rearrangements alternative high energy phosphoryl transfer pathways. define mechanisms adaptive response, soleus gastrocnemius muscles AK1(-/-) mice characterized cDNA array profiling, Western blot ultrastructural analysis. demonstrate AK1 deficiency induces fiber-type specific variation groups transcripts involved glycolysis mitochondrial metabolism gene products defining structural myogenic events. associated increased phosphotransfer capacities glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Moreover, AK1(-/-) mice, fast-twitch gastrocnemius, slow-twitch soleus, increase adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) mitochondrial creatine kinase protein, along doubling intermyofibrillar mitochondrial volume. results provide molecular evidence wide-scale remodeling AK1-deficient muscles aimed preservation efficient energetic communication ATP producing utilizing cellular sites.
