 BACKGROUND & AIMS: proposed p38 involved gluconeogenesis, however, genetic evidence lacking precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. sought delineate role hepatic p38alpha gluconeogenesis fasting applying loss-of-function genetic approach. METHODS: examined fasting glucose levels, performed pyruvate tolerance test, imaged G6Pase promoter activity, well determined expression gluconeogenic genes mice targeted deletion p38alpha liver. Results confirmed vivo vitro using adenoviral dominant-negative form p38alpha (p38alpha-AF) constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase 6, respectively. Adenoviral dominant-negative form AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (DN-AMPKalpha) employed test proposed model. RESULTS: Mice lacking hepatic p38alpha exhibited reduced fasting glucose level impaired gluconeogenesis. Interestingly, hepatic deficiency p38alpha result alteration CREB phosphorylation, led increase AMPKalpha phosphorylation. Adenoviral DN-AMPKalpha could abolish effect p38alpha-AF gluconeogenesis. Knockdown up-steam transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 decreased AMPKalpha phosphorylation induced p38alpha-AF, suggesting negative feedback loop. Consistently, inverse correlations p38 AMPKalpha phosphorylation observed fasting diabetic mouse models. Importantly, adenoviral p38alpha-AF treatment ameliorated hyperglycemia diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: study provides evidence hepatic p38alpha functions negative regulator AMPK signaling maintaining gluconeogenesis, dysregulation regulatory network contributes unrestrained gluconeogenesis diabetes, hepatic p38alpha could drug target hyperglycemia.
