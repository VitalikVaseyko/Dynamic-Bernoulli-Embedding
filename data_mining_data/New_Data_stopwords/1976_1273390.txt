 oxygen affinities blood eight Basenji dogs homozygous classical erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency four dogs heterozygous defect compared blood 14 Labrador retrievers two normal Basenji dogs. homozygous dogs showed significant anemia compared heterozygous normal dogs (P less 0.01). average blood P50 value (at 38C plasma pH 7.40) homozygous heterozygous dogs significantly higher (P less 0.01) normal dogs (33.6+/-0.4 31.8+/-0.7 vs 30.8+/-0.6 mm Hg). concentrations 2,3-DPG blood heterozygous homozygous dogs significantly higher normal values. Four months splenectomy P50 values declined normal four homozygous Basenji dogs without change degree anemia blood 2,3-DPG concentrations. Iron kinetic studies showed shorter plasma clearance time homozygous normal dog heterozygote falling midway between. red cell life span normal heterozygous dogs approximately 120 days. 59Fe studies homozygous dog indicate markedly different survival characteristics attributed existence three populations red cells differing life spans.
