 Partially permeabilized rat adipocytes high responsiveness insulin prepared electroporation used study effect 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) insulin actions adipocytes. H-7 well-documented inhibitor several protein kinases, including protein kinase C; however, rapidly enter adipocytes protected intact plasma membrane. cells suspended Buffer X [4.74 mM NaCl, 118.0 mM KCl, 0.38 mM CaCl2, 1.00 mM EGTA, 1.19 mM Mg2SO4, 1.19 mM KH2PO4, 25.0 mM Hepes/K, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mM pyruvate/Na, pH 7.4] electroporated six times Gene-Pulser (from Bio-Rad) set 25 microF 2 kV/cm. cells electroporated above, insulin stimulated (a) membrane-bound, cAMP phosphodiesterase approximately 2.6-fold hormone concentration 10 nM (b) glucose transport activity approximately 4.5-fold hormone concentration raised 100 nM. H-7 strongly inhibited actions insulin glucose transport (apparent Ki = 0.3 mM) cAMP phosphodiesterase (apparent Ki = 1.2 mM) electroporated adipocytes. H-7 also inhibited lipolysis adipocytes; apparent Ki value reaction intact cells 0.45 mM, electroporated cells 0.075 mM. suggested certain protein kinase kinases significantly sensitive H-7 may involved insulin-dependent stimulation glucose transport phosphodiesterase. However, protein kinase C (or Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase) may involved, least, hormonal action phosphodiesterase since apparent Ki value H-7 reaction high.
