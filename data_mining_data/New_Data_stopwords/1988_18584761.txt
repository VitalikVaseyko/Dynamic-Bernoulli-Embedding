 effect ethanol activities key enzymes glycolytic pathway two membrane functions related fermentation, glucose uptake system, proton extrusion rate examined. results indicate ethanol, 2M, cause change glucose uptake velocity substantial change key glycolytic enzyme activities fermentation rate reduced 50%. cell extract 3M ethanol well incubation yeast cells 4M ethanol caused considerable decrease pyruvate kinase hexokinase activities. Phosphofructokinase remained unchanged even higher ethanol concentrations. Transmembrane proton flow found sensitive functions tested toward ethanol, could represent first target ethanol action fermentation.
