 response heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) expression beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) treated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) corresponded altered metabolic status liver evidenced lower phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), lactate dehydrogenase 3-hydroxyacylcoA dehydrogenase activities. BNF-induced increase hsp70 levels conjugation enzyme activities (phase phase II) modified handling stress. Indeed handling stress affect either hsp 70 levels conjugation enzyme activities trout liver. decrease hepatic PEPCK activity BNF group may responsible attenuation increase liver glucose concentration 3 min handling stress species, suggesting BNF affects liver gluconeogenic capacity species. Handling stress elicited plasma cortisol glucose response sham BNF group, however, cortisol response BNF erratic compared sham, implying alterations cortisol dynamics post-stress. results show first time BNF affects cellular metabolic responses stress suggests possibility using hsp 70 biomarker toxic effects trout.
