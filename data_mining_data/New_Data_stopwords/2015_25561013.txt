 PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PCa) second common cause cancer-related death among men United States. Due lipid-driven metabolic phenotype PCa, imaging 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) suboptimal, since tumors tend low avidity glucose. PROCEDURES: used fat oxidation inhibitor etomoxir (2-[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)-hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate) targets carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase-1 (CPT-1) increase glucose uptake PCa cell lines. Small hairpin RNA specific CPT1A used confirm glycolytic switch induced etomoxir vitro. Systemic etomoxir treatment used enhance [(18)F]FDG-positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG-PET) imaging PCa xenograft mouse models 24 h. RESULTS: PCa cells significantly oxidize circulating fatty acids benign cells via CPT-1 enzyme, blocking lipid oxidation resulted activation Warburg effect enhanced [(18)F]FDG signal PCa mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition lipid oxidation plays major role elevating glucose metabolism PCa cells, potential imaging enhancement could also extended cancers.
