 Metabolic disorders obesity, insulin resistance type 2 diabetes mellitus linked cardiovascular diseases cardiac hypertrophy heart failure. Diabetic cardiomyopathy particular, characterized structural functional alterations heart muscle people diabetes finally lead heart failure, directly attributable coronary artery disease hypertension. Several mechanisms involved pathogenesis diabetic cardiomyopathy, alterations myocardial energy metabolism calcium signaling. Metabolic disturbances diabetic cardiomyopathy characterized increased lipid oxidation, intramyocardial triglyceride accumulation, reduced glucose utilization. Overall changes result enhanced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction apoptosis cardiomyocytes. hand, progression heart failure cardiac hypertrophy usually entails local rise cytokines cardiac cells activation proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Interestingly, increasing evidences arising recent years point potential link chronic low-grade inflammation heart metabolic dysregulation. Therefore, review summarize recent new insights crosstalk inflammatory processes metabolic dysregulation failing heart diabetes, paying special attention role NF-kappaB peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs). addition, briefly describe role AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) pathways regulating cardiac energy metabolism, well relationship diabetic cardiomyopathy.
