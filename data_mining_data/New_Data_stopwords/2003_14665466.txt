 MADS box transcription factor SrfA required spore differentiation Dictyostelium discoideum. srfA null strains form rounded spores resist adverse environmental conditions. Five genes whose expression dependent SrfA isolated differential hybridization. One genes, sigC, identical phg1b, previously characterized mutants altered adhesive properties found encode nine-transmembrane-domain protein. gene transcribed two mRNAs result alternative splicing two internal exons. slower-migrating mRNA codes shorter protein lacks first transmembrane fragment expressed srfA null strains. four genes (sigA, sigB, sigD, 45D) expressed late developmental stages. situ hybridization experiments showed expression sigA, sigB, sigD restricted sorus developing structures. sigA codes homologue malate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate malate replenish tricarboxylic acid cycle. sigB encodes protein significant similarity GP63 metalloproteinase Leishmania, leishmanolysin. sequence SigD highly similar several spore coat proteins D. discoideum, may play role structure. gene 45D codes RNA-binding protein homologue whose expression also dependent GATA transcription factor stalky (StkA). expression sigB also dependent SrfA StkA. expression 45D, sigA, sigB, sigC, sigD, induced srfA null cells constitutive protein kinase activation. Strains either sigA, sigB, sigD disrupted isolated found form spores detectably different wild-type strains.
