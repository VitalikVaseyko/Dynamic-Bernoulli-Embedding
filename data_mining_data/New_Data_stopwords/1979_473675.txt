 Together increase total activity pyruvate kinase, alterations isoenzyme spectrum observed hepatocarcinogenesis caused treatment rats diethylinitrosamine. alterations might divided two steps: initial, reversible changes changes immediately related development blastomatous process. total activity pyruvate kinase gradually increased appearance hyperplastic symptoms well primary tumoral foci liver tissue. M2-type pyruvate kinase tended exhibit activation. primary hepatomas L-type enzyme decreased activity M2-type increased.
