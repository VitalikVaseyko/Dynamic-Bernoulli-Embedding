 report simple, fast, cost-effective approach measures cancer cell metabolism response anticancer drugs real time. Using Light Addressable Potentiometric Sensor integrated pH sensitive hydrogel nanofibers (NF-LAPS), detect localized changes pH media cancer cells consume glucose release lactate. NF-LAPS shows sensitivity response 74 mV/pH cancer cells. Cancer cells (MDA MB231) showed response approximately 0.4 unit change pH compared virtually change observed normal cells (MCF10A). also observed drop pH multidrug-resistant cancer cells (MDA-MB-435MDR) presence doxorubicin. However, inhibition metabolic enzymes hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase-A suggested improvement efficacy doxorubicin decreasing level acidification. approach, based extracellular acidification, enhances understanding cancer cell metabolic modes response chemotherapies, help development better treatments, including choice drugs dosages.
