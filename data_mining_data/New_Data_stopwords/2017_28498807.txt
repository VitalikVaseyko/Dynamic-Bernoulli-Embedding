 Clinical treatment colorectal cancer (CRC) thus far encounters huge challenge due oxaliplatin-resistance. crucial rate-limiting enzymes aerobic glycolysis glutaminolysis, pyruvate kinase M2 type (PKM2) kidney-type glutaminase (GLS1) proposed carry important implications colorectal carcinogenesis drug-resistance. study aimed explore possible association oxaliplatin-resistance aerobic glycolysis/glutaminolysis indexed PKM2/GLS1 expression. PKM2 GLS1 expression quantified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Western blot techniques CRC cell lines. abilities cell formation, kinetics, migration, invasion, survival apoptosis, well permeability glycoprotein (Pgp) expression inspected knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression. addition, influence knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression evaluated vivo. Differentiated PKM2 GLS1 expression THC8307 THC8307/Oxa cell lines identified. THC8307 cell line, PKM2 GLS1 accelerate malignant behaviors, increase oxaliplatin-resistance, upregulate Pgp expression, inhibit cell apoptosis. Contrastingly THC8307/Oxa cell line, knockdown PKM2/GLS1 expression restrain malignant behaviors, reestablish oxaliplatin-sensitivity, downregulate Pgp expression, induce cell apoptosis. xenograft, knockdown PKM2/GLS1 expression significantly inhibit tumor growth, reduce Pgp expression, increase tumor apoptosis. Taken together, present findings enriched knowledge demonstrating significant association PKM2 GLS1 oxaliplatin-resistance CRC. propose knockdown PKM2/GLS1 expression may constitute novel therapeutic strategy toward effective treatment CRC.
