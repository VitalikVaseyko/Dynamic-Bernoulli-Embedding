 phosphate-dependent transition enzymatically inert dimers catalytically capable tetramers long accepted mechanism glutaminase activation. Here, demonstrate activated glutaminase C (GAC) self-assembles helical, fiber-like double-stranded oligomer propose molecular model consisting seven tetramer copies per turn per strand interacting via N-terminal domains. loop (321)LRFNKL(326) projected major regulating element self-assembly enzyme activation. Furthermore, previously identified vivo lysine acetylation (Lys(311) humans, Lys(316) mouse) proposed important down-regulator superoligomer assembly protein activation. Bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide, known glutaminase inhibitor, completely disrupted higher order oligomer, explaining allosteric mechanism inhibition via tetramer stabilization. direct correlation tendency self-assemble activity levels three mammalian glutaminase isozymes established, GAC active enzyme forming longest structures. Lastly, ectopic expression fiber-prone superactive GAC mutant MDA-MB 231 cancer cells provided considerable proliferative advantages transformed cells. findings yield unique implications development GAC-oriented therapeutics targeting tumor metabolism.
