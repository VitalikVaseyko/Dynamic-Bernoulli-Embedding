 UNLABELLED: Hypoxia common characteristic many solid tumors. hypoxic microenvironment stabilizes hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) 2alpha (HIF2alpha/EPAS1) activate gene transcription, promotes tumor cell survival. majority human genes alternatively spliced, producing RNA isoforms code functionally distinct proteins. Thus, effective hypoxia response requires increased HIF target gene expression well proper RNA splicing HIF-dependent transcripts. However, unclear hypoxia regulates RNA splicing HIF targets. study determined effects hypoxia alternative splicing (AS) HIF non-HIF target genes hepatocellular carcinoma cells characterized role HIF regulating HIF-induced genes. results indicate hypoxia generally promotes exon inclusion hypoxia-induced, reduces exon inclusion hypoxia-reduced genes. Mechanistically, HIF activity, hypoxia per se found necessary sufficient increase exon inclusion several HIF targets, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 splicing reporters confirm transcriptional activation HIF sufficient increase exon inclusion PDK1 splicing reporter. contrast, transcriptional activation PDK1 minigene transcription factors absence endogenous HIF target gene activation fails alter PDK1 RNA splicing. IMPLICATIONS: study demonstrates novel function HIF regulating RNA splicing HIF target genes.
