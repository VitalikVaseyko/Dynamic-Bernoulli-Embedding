 investigational drug dichloroacetate (DCA) metabolic regulator successfully used treat acquired congenital metabolic diseases and, recently, solid tumors. clinical use revealed challenges selecting appropriate doses. Chronic administration DCA leads inhibition DCA metabolism potential accumulation levels result side effects. conversion DCA glyoxylate catalyzed one enzyme, glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1-1), inactivated DCA. SNPs GSTZ1 gene result expression polymorphic variants enzyme differ activity rates inactivation DCA physiological conditions: properties lead considerable variation people pharmacokinetics DCA.
