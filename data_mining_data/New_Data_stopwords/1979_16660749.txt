 Organelles isolated dark-grown Euglena gracilis Klebs sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Plastids, identified triosephosphate isomerase NADP glyoxylate reductase present equilibrium density 1.24 grams per cubic centimeter clearly separated mitochondria equilibrium density 1.22 grams per cubic centimeter. Assay choline phosphotransferase glucose-6-phosphatase showed endoplasmic reticulum membranes present density 1.12 grams per cubic centimeter. plastid fraction contained phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase aldolase indicating operation glycolytic pathway. regreening pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase developing proplastid decreased, neither enzyme present mature chloroplast. However, plastids present photosynthetic cell shown peak glycolysis enzymes equilibrium density 1.24 grams per cubic centimeter.The integrity isolated plastids demonstrated capacity protein synthesis. Plastids isolated dark-grown cells rapidly incorporated [(35)S]methionine protein absolute dependence added ATP. large subunit ribulose diphosphate carboxylase major polypeptide synthesized isolated plastids.
