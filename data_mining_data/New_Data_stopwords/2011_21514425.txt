 Hepatic stellate cell transdifferentiation key event fibrogenic cascade. Therefore, attempts prevent and/or revert myofibroblastic phenotype could result novel therapeutic approaches treat liver cirrhosis. expression platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-beta receptor proliferative response platelet-derived growth factor-betabeta (PDGF-betabeta) hallmarks transdifferentiation hepatic stellate cells (HSC). communication, investigated whether thymosin-beta4 (Tbeta4), chemokine expressed HSC could prevent PDGF-BB-mediated proliferation migration cultured HSC. Using early passages human HSC, showed Tbeta4 inhibited cell proliferation migration prevented expression PDGF-beta receptor (PDGF-betar), alpha-smooth muscle actin alpha1(I) collagen mRNAs. Tbeta4 also inhibited reappearance PDGF-betar PDGF-BB-dependent degradation. PDGF-dependent events associated inhibition AKT phosphorylation T308 S473 amino acid residues. lack AKT phosphorylation due inhibition PDGF-betar phosphorylation, activation phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK1), mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR). found PDGF-BB induced AKT binding actin, Tbeta4 prevented effect. Tbeta4 also prevented activation freshly isolated HSC cultured presence Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. conclusion, overall, findings suggest Tbeta4 sequestering actin prevents binding AKT, thus inhibiting phosphorylation. Therefore, Tbeta4 potential antifibrogenic agent.
