 Glipizide raised, dose-dependent manner, concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate hepatocytes isolated 24-hour fasted rats incubated presence 10 mmol/L glucose. Simultaneously, rate L-lactate production, well rate 3H2O formation (3-3H)glucose, increased markedly. concentration glipizide calculated corresponding half-maximal effect metabolic parameters 12 15 mumol/L. hepatocytes isolated fed rats, either normal made diabetic treatment alloxan, glipizide inhibited conversion (U-14C)pyruvate (U-14C)lactate (14C)glucose; inverse correlation established hepatocyte fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels rate gluconeogenesis. increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration elicited glipizide, occurs without significant modification either 6-phospho-fructo 2-kinase activity hepatocyte cyclic AMP levels, seems related significant accumulation hexose 6-phosphates (glucose 6-phosphate fructose 6-phosphate) hepatic cells.
