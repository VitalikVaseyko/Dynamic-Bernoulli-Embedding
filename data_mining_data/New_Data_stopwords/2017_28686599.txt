 liver vital organ involving various major metabolic functions human body. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) plays important role regulation liver metabolism, intrinsic physiological functions require clarification. study integrated genome-scale metabolic model hepatocytes mouse experimental data germline deletion Mir122a (Mir122a-/-) infer Warburg-like effects. Elevated expression MiR-122a target genes Mir122a-/-mice, especially encoding metabolic enzymes, applied analyze flux distributions genome-scale metabolic model normal deficient states. definition similarity ratio, compared flux fold change genome-scale metabolic model computational results metabolomic profiling data measured liquid-chromatography mass spectrometer, respectively, hepatocytes 2-month-old mice normal deficient states. Ddc gene demonstrated highest similarity ratio 95% biological hypothesis Warburg effect, similarity 75% experimental observation. also used 2, 6, 11 months mir-122 knockout mice liver cell examined expression pattern DDC knockout mice livers show upregulated profiles DDC data. Furthermore, bioinformatics (LINCS program) prediction, BTK inhibitors withaferin could downregulate DDC expression, suggesting drugs could potentially alter early events metabolomics liver cancer cells.
