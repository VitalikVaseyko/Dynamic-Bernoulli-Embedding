 Metabolic pathways play indispensable role supplying cellular systems energy molecular building blocks growth, maintenance repair tightly linked lifespan systems stability cells. optimal growth survival cells rapidly adopt environmental changes. Accumulation acetic acid stationary phase budding yeast cultures considered primary mechanism chronological aging induction apoptosis yeast, prompted us investigate dependence acetic acid toxicity extracellular conditions systematic manner. Using automated computer controlled assay system, investigated model dynamic interconnection biomass yield- growth rate-dependence extracellular glucose concentration, pH conditions acetic acid concentration. results show toxic concentrations acetic acid inhibit glucose consumption reduce ethanol production. absence carbohydrates uptake, cells initiate synthesis storage carbohydrates, trehalose glycogen, upregulate gluconeogenesis. Accumulation trehalose glycogen, induction gluconeogenesis depends mitochondrial activity, investigated depletion Hap2-3-4-5 complex. Analyzing activity glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase (PYK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) found high acetic acid concentration increased activity, lower acetic acids concentrations significantly inhibited enzymes. study determined growth functional adjustment metabolism acetic acid accumulation complex range extracellular conditions. results show substantial acidification intracellular environment, resulting accumulation dissociated acetic acid cytosol, required acetic acid toxicity, creates state energy deficiency nutrient starvation.
