 good account nature cancer provide description consistent features, also arise, maintained, conventional chemotherapy succeeds, fails, look better targets. Cancer regarded enigmatic inexplicable; recently, "mutation theory," based random alterations relatively small set proto-oncogenes tumor suppressor genes, enjoyed widespread acceptance. "mutation theory," however, noticeable failure explain basis differential chemosensitivity, providing paucity targets, especially druggable ones, justifying development targeted therapies with, general, disappointingly abbreviated clinical benefit. Furthermore, theory mistakenly predicted widespread commonality consistent genetic abnormalities across range cancers, whereas opposite, is, roiling macrogenomic instability, generally rule. contrast, concerning actually consistent, is, suite metabolic derangements common virtually all, especially aggressive, cancers, "Mutation Theory" nothing say. hypotheses merit serious consideration "aneuploidy theories" posit whole-genome instability imbalance causally responsible propagation tumor. Another approach, is, "derepression atavism," suggests cancer results release ancient survival program, characterized emergence remarkably primitive features unicellularity, fermentation, immortality; existential goals served heuristic genomic instability coupled host-to-tumor biomass interconversion, mediated Warburg effect, major component program. Carcinogenesis seen process de-speciation; however, genomic nonrestabilization raises issues tree life cancers belong, genuinely alternative modus vivendi. Philosophical considerations aside, genomic instability offers prospect subtle new therapies based loss information rather gain; consistent, specific, broad-spectrum perfidy Warburg effect highlights supplemental target highest priority.
