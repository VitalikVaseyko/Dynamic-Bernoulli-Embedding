 Mammalian E3 essential mitochondrial enzyme responsible catalyzing terminal reaction oxidative catabolism several metabolites. E3 key regulator metabolic fuel selection component pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc). E3 regulates PDHc activity altering affinity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, inhibitor enzyme complex, changes reduction acetylation state lipoamide moieties set NAD(+)/NADH ratio. Thus, accurate kinetic model E3 needed predict overall mammalian PDHc activity. Here, combined numerous literature data sets new equilibrium spectroscopic experiments multitude independently collected forward reverse steady-state kinetic assays using pig heart E3. latter kinetic assays demonstrate pH-dependent transition NAD(+) activation inhibition, shown here, knowledge, first time single consistent data set. Experimental data analyzed yield thermodynamically constrained four-redox-state model E3 simulates pH-dependent activation/inhibition active site redox states various conditions. developed model used determine substrate/product conditions give maximal E3 rates show that, due non-Michaelis-Menten behavior, maximal flux different compared classically defined kcat.
