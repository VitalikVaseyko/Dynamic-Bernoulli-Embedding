 Individual members creatine kinase isoenzyme family (CK; EC 2.7.3.2), play prominent role energy homeostasis, encoded four separate nuclear genes. isolated characterized complete mouse UbCKmit gene, product ubiquitously expressed located intermembrane space mitochondria. Transcription gene initiated multiple adjacent positions region immediately upstream sites shares many features genes encoding housekeeping proteins. include high G/C content, absence TATA CCAAT motifs, presence SP1 AP2 recognition sequences. addition, binding site HIP1, hormone-responsive elements, three Mt-motifs, known boxes shared nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, identified. study functional role UbCKmit protein, inactivated UbCKmit alleles mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. UbCKmit-deficient cells, obtained consecutive rounds gene targeting using homologous recombination drug selection-driven gene conversion events, show obvious growth disadvantage abnormal differentiation potential. Activities mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase citrate synthase, well rate pyruvate oxidation, showed values equal wild-type cells, indicating normal aerobic metabolism. Mitochondria vivo differentiated knock-out cells structurally intact, demonstrated electron microscopy. Approaches study role UbCKmit gene discussed.
