 cactus Opuntia ficus-indica constitutive Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) species. Current knowledge CAM metabolism suggests enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PPCK) circadian regulated transcriptional level, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) posttranslationally controlled. little transcriptomic data available obligate CAM plants, created expressed sequence tag database derived different organs developmental stages. Sequences assembled, compared sequences National Center Biotechnology Information nonredundant database identification putative orthologs, mapped using Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes Genomes Orthology Gene Ontology. identified genes involved circadian regulation CAM metabolism transcriptomic analysis plants grown long days. identified stable reference genes quantitative polymerase chain reaction found OfiSAND, like counterpart Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), OfiTUB generally appropriate standards use quantification gene expression O. ficus-indica. Three kinds expression profiles found: transcripts OfiPPCK oscillated 24-h periodicity; transcripts light-active OfiNADP-ME OfiPPDK genes adapted 12-h cycles, transcript accumulation patterns OfiPEPC OfiMDH arrhythmic. Expression circadian clock gene OfiTOC1, similar Arabidopsis, oscillated 24-h periodicity, peaking night. Expression OfiCCA1 OfiPRR9, unlike Arabidopsis, adapted best 12-h rhythm, suggesting circadian clock gene interactions differ Arabidopsis. results indicate evolution CAM metabolism could result modified circadian regulation transcriptional posttranscriptional levels.
