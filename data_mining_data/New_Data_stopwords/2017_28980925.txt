 Osteosarcoma frequent primary bone tumor originating adolescents young adults. Despite improvements chemo- radio- therapy osteosarcoma patients, survival rate increased drug resistance becomes major factor limits effectiveness. Therefore, investigation new treatment modalities urgently required optimize therapeutic options. previous study described oncogenic role miR-214 promotion osteosarcoma cells proliferation. study, report miR-214 contributes cisplatin resistance osteosarcoma cells. Overexpression miR-214 decreased cisplatin sensitivity. establishing osteosarcoma cisplatin resistant cell line, find miR-214 significantly upregulated cisplatin resistant cells. Moreover, show miR-214 promotes anaerobic glycolysis rates osteosarcoma cells suppresses mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Consistently, cisplatin resistant cells exhibit upregulated glycolysis decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, phenotype called "Warburg effect". Finally, demonstrate inhibition glycolysis either glycolysis inhibitor miR-214 inhibition significantly re-sensitizes cisplatin resistant osteosarcoma cells. summary, study illustrates miRNA-involved chemosensitivity osteosarcoma contribute developments therapeutic agents anti-chemoresistance treatments.
