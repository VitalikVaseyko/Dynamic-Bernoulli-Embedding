 Glycolytic glucose degradation lactate way energy production mammalian cells use oxygen, thus means reducing oxidative stress. aim work study effect proliferation progressive glucose depletion cell cycle stimulated cultured rat thymocytes. shown conditions limited glucose supply, cells increase generation reactive oxygen species. sensitivity stimulating transcription factor Sp1 redox changes respect DNA binding, gene expression glycolytic enzymes markedly suppressed. consequence, cell division occur glucose depleted thymocytes.
