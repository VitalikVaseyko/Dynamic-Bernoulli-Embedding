 Several strains non-citrate-metabolizing Pediococcus halophilus previously isolated soy sauce mash moromi. factors controlling metabolism citrate soy pediococci studied. soy pediococcal strains tested failed decompose citrate possess citrate lyase [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase; EC 4.1.3.6] activity. P. halophilus, citrate lyase inducible enzyme, optimum pH activity 7.0. metabolism citrate P. halophilus different observed lactic streptococci. main products citrate acetate formate, bacterium produced acetoin diacetyl. Formate production citrate greatly reduced presence glucose. P. halophilus 7117 (Cit) proved contain citrate lyase, pyruvate formate-lyase (EC 2.3.1.54) phosphotransacetylase (phosphate acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.8), acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1), i.e., enzymes necessary convert citrate acetate formate.
