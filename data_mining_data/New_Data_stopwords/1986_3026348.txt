 Rat epididymal-adipose-tissue mitochondria made selectively permeable small molecules without loss matrix enzymes treating mitochondria toluene controlled conditions. preparation entire pyruvate dehydrogenase system shown retained within mitochondrial matrix retain normal catalytic activity. using dilute suspensions permeabilized mitochondria maintained cuvette spectrophotometer, possible monitor changes pyruvate dehydrogenase activity continuously activities interconverting kinase phosphatase could independently manipulated. Permeabilized mitochondria prepared control insulin-treated adipose tissue, properties pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase phosphatase compared situ. difference kinase activity detected, increases phosphatase activity observed permeabilized mitochondria insulin-treated tissue. studies showed main effect insulin treatment decrease apparent Ka phosphatase Mg2+, agreement earlier studies mitochondria made permeable Mg2+ using ionophore A23187 [Thomas, Diggle & Denton (1986) Biochem. J. 238, 83-91]. effects spermine detected, although spermine diminishes Ka purified phosphatase preparations Mg2+. Since effects insulin pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase activity evident mitochondrial extracts, concluded insulin may act altering high-Mr component interacts pyruvate dehydrogenase system within intact permeabilized mitochondria, mitochondrial membranes disrupted.
