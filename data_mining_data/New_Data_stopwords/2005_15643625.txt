 enzyme reaction mechanism kinetics biosyntheses deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) corresponding deoxyadenosine diphosphate (dADP) deoxyguanosine diphosphate (dGDP) catalyzed pyruvate kinase studied. kinetic model synthetic reaction developed based Bi-Bi random rapid equilibrium mechanism. Kinetic constants involved pyruvate kinase catalyzed phosphorylation reactions deoxynucleoside diphosphates including maximum reaction velocity, Michaelis-Menten constants, inhibition constants dATP dGTP biosyntheses experimentally determined. kinetic constants dATP dGTP biosyntheses order magnitude significantly different two reactions. Kinetic constants involved ATP GTP biosyntheses reported literature one order magnitude different involved dATP dGTP biosyntheses. enzyme reaction requires Mg2+ ion optimal Mg2+ concentration also determined. experimental results showed good agreement simulation results obtained kinetic model developed. kinetic model applied practical application pyruvate kinase reaction system production dATP dGTP. significant advantage using enzymatic biosyntheses dATP dGTP compared chemical method commercial use.
