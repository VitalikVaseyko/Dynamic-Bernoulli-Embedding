 influence epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.75 micrograms g1; insulin, 1.5 micrograms g-1; glucagon, 1.25 micrograms g-1 combinations activities hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) malic enzymes (ME) monitored. Male CD2F1 mice treated toward end light dark periods, 9 23 hours lights (9 23 HALO), subgroups six mice killed 4, 8 12 hr post-treatment. PK activities control mice well characterized cosine curves. PK activity maximal activity minimal transition light dark (9 HALO plus 4 hr) PK minimum highest (23 HALO plus 4 hr). enzymes influenced least one peptide hormone, effects strongly circadian-stage dependent. effect attributed EGF increase PK activity (23%) 12 hr injection 23 HALO. PK activity increased insulin (23%) 23 HALO (4 hr injection), 9 HALO, decreased (17%) glucagon 12 hr injection 9 HALO. Several reductions PK activity response various combinations peptides observed, appeared caused glucagon influenced insulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
