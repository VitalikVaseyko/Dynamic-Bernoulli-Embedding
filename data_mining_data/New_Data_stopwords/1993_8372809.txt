 prevalence pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency among Chinese population established. Fung et al. (Arch Dis Child 44:373-376, 1969) Wu et al. (Am J Hematol 20:139-144, 1985) indicate 3.4% 2.1% PK deficiency prevalence rates, respectively, higher figure based Beutler's screening test [3] without confirmatory testing. Neither figure consistent occurrence hemolytic anemia cause experiences hematologists Hong Kong. Using standard quantitative assay, measured PK activity blood samples 1,100 local Chinese people. assay automated centrifugal analyser, results expressed IU per gram hemoglobin (IU/g Hb). Blood samples 497 healthy male adults measured, PK activity found range 15.2 +/- 5.2 (mean +/- 2 SD). total 100 cord blood samples also measured, reference interval subgroup 17.7 +/- 4.8. Additionally, samples 503 anaemic patients measured, found values lower limit reference interval. prevalence PK deficiency among Hong Kong Chinese population determined study < 0.1%.
