 minimal concentration platelet aggregation principle (Platelet Aggregoserpentin, PAS) necessary induce platelet aggregation 10 ng/ml, one-hundredth crude venom. PAS induced release platelet factors 3 4 platelets, released platelet factor 3 easily inactivated anti-phospholipid effect PAS. Pretreatment platelets neuraminidase potentiated PAS-induced platelet aggregation. PAS-induced platelet aggregation independent released ADP; could occur ADP-removing systems, apyrase combination phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. However, PAS-induced platelet aggregation could inhibited adenine nucleotides adenosine. PAS-induced platelet aggregation inhibited anti-inflammatory agents, antimalarial drugs, local anesthetics, antihistamine smooth muscle relaxants. deaggregation PAS-treated platelets, thrombin sodium arachidonate could induce platelet aggregation, ADP second dose PAS could not. concluded PAS-induced platelet aggregation due prostaglandin synthesis. Recent literatures mechanism platelet aggregation surveyed actions PAS discussed.
