 Exendin-4, peptide 53% structurally homologous glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), insulinotropic antidiabetic effect even prolonged GLP-1. Exendin-9 antagonist GLP-1 receptor action several cell systems, shows GLP-1- exendin-4-agonistic characteristics human muscle cells tissue. action GLP-1 upon glucose transport metabolism muscle mediated specific receptors. study investigated effect exendin-4 -9, relative GLP-1, upon glucose transport metabolism skeletal muscle streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rat model, compared normal. normal rats, exendin-4, like GLP-1 insulin, enhanced glucose uptake. effect, mediated certain extent kinases (PI3K/ PKB, p70s6k MAPKs), may caused peptide acting, least part, muscle GLP-1 receptors. Exendin-9 also stimulated kinases, except PKB, failed modify basal glucose uptake. Type 2 diabetic rats showed lower normal basal muscle glucose transport oxidation value, higher glycogen synthase alpha activity pyruvate release; however, modification glucose uptake GLP-1 exendin-4 detected, variance insulin, basal activity PI3K/PKB lower normal, p70s6k MAPKs higher. GLP-1 failed affect activity kinases, exendin-4 increased activity PI3K, p70s6k MAPKs, PKB, suggesting enzyme plays major role exendin-4 effect upon glucose transport muscle.
