 protein phosphatase isolated yeast, Candida utilis, could reactivate (dephosphorylate) phosphorylated form NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase. protein could also dephosphorylate casein, histone kemptide (a heptapeptide corresponding phosphorylation site liver pyruvate kinase). Reactivation phosphorylated glutamate dehydrogenase stimulated simultaneous addition NAD L-glutamate; 2-oxoglutarate, NH+4 NADH effect. reactivation phosphorylated glutamate dehydrogenase could inhibited phosphate, pyrophosphate fluoride.
