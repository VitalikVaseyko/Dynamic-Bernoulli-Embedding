 roles pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), glycogen phosphorylase (Phos), regulators lactate (Lac(-)) metabolism examined incremental exercise ingestion 0.3 g/kg either NH(4)Cl [metabolic acidosis (ACID)] CaCO(3) [control (CON)]. Subjects studied rest, rest postingestion, continuous steady-state cycling three stages (15 min each): 30, 60, 75% maximal oxygen uptake. Radial artery femoral venous blood samples, leg blood flow, biopsies vastus lateralis obtained power output. ACID resulted significantly lower intramuscular concentration [Lac(-)] (ACID 40.8 vs. CON 56.9 mmol/kg dry wt), arterial whole blood [Lac(-)] (ACID 4.7 vs. CON 6.5 mmol/l), leg Lac(-) efflux (ACID 3.05 vs. CON 6.98 mmol. l(-1). min(-1)). reduced intramuscular [Lac(-)] resulted decreases pyruvate production due inhibition glycogenolysis, level Phos a, phosphofructokinase, together increase amount pyruvate oxidized relative total produced. reduction Phos activity mediated decreases transformation, decreases free inorganic phosphate concentration, decreases posttransformational allosteric regulator free AMP. Reduced PDH activity occurred ACID may resulted alterations concentrations acetyl-CoA, free ADP, pyruvate, NADH, H(+), leading greater relative activity kinase. results demonstrate imposed metabolic acidosis skeletal muscle results decreased Lac(-) production due inhibition glycogenolysis level Phos increased pyruvate oxidation PDH.
