 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) serves inducible coactivator number transcription factors control energy metabolism. Insulin signaling Akt kinase demonstrated phosphorylate PGC-1alpha serine 571 downregulate activity liver. Statins 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase inhibitors reduce cholesterol synthesis liver. study, found statins reduced active form Akt enhanced PGC-1alpha activity. Specifically, statins failed activate S571A mutant PGC-1alpha. activation PGC-1alpha statins selectively enhanced expression energy metabolizing enzymes regulators including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1A, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4. Importantly, constitutively active form Akt partially reduced statin-enhanced gene expression. study thus provides plausible mechanistic explanation hypolipidemic effect statin elevating rate beta-oxidation mitochondrial Kreb's cycle capacity enhance fatty acid utilization reducing rate glycolysis.
