 cooperative enzyme reaction rates predicted bi-substrate Hill equation bi-substrate Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) equation allosterically inhibited compared silico. Theoretically, Hill equation predicts maximum inhibitory effect certain substrate condition reached, increase allosteric inhibitor concentration effect reaction rate, Hill equation shows allosteric inhibitor saturation. saturating inhibitory effect present MWC equation. Experimental vitro data pyruvate kinase, bi-substrate cooperative enzyme allosterically inhibited, presented. enzyme also shows inhibitor saturation, therefore serves experimental evidence bi-substrate Hill equation predicts realistic allosteric inhibitor behaviour bi-substrate MWC equation.
