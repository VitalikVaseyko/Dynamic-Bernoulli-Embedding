 putative mediator intracellular insulin action assayed quantitatively ability increase activity solubilized pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphatase. Conversion soluble beef heart PDH b PDH PDH phosphatase increased incubation carried presence crude insulin mediator fraction generated insulin-treated adipose tissue liver plasma membranes. Increased PDH phosphatase activity proportional concentration added insulin mediator. Mediator generation rapid, half-time approximately 45 sec insulin dose dependent. Half-maximal mediator activity produced 0.3 nM added insulin, maximal activity generated approximately 3 nM insulin. Mediator activity significantly decreased 7 nM insulin, increased 4-fold ethanol extraction. Mediator behaved activator PDH phosphatase, apparently abolishing inhibitory effects ATP phosphatase activity, effect PDH kinase activity. assay insulin mediator activity described carried standardized conditions, contrast previously described methods using particulate mitochondrial preparations.
