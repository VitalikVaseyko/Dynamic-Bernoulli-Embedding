 Pyruvate kinase converts phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, catalyzing rate-limiting step glycolysis. M1 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM1) found adult tissues; whereas, PKM2 splicesome variant found embryonic cancer cells. PKM2 expression malignant cells result tumor microenvironment responsible maintaining glycolytic phenotype. PKM2 nonmetabolic functions malignant cells, including transcriptional coactivation protein kinase activity. PKM2 activators antitumor properties inducing tetramerization two PKM2 dimers causing PKM2 function like PKM1. Restoring PKM2 PKM1-like levels activity causes reversal Warburg effect cancer cells. PKM2 activators therapeutic potential treatment cancer metabolic diseases.
