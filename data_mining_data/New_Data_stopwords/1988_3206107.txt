 five glycolytic enzymes tested, serum activity phosphohexose isomerase (PHI) elevated vast majority 140 patients gastrointestinal, kidney mammary carcinomas. However, tumor tissues enzymes increased extent. Thus, measured increase serum activity PHI due specific overproduction malignant cells. general rise glycolytic enzyme activities malignant tissue could detected already early stages without metastases well-differentiated tumors.
