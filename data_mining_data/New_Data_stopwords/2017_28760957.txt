 Proinflammatory mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) play crucial role progression multiple sclerosis (MS) neurodegenerative diseases. Despite advances neuroimaging, currently limited available methods enabling noninvasive detection MPs vivo. Interestingly, upon activation subsequent differentiation toward proinflammatory phenotype MPs undergo metabolic reprogramming results increased glycolysis production lactate. Hyperpolarized (HP) (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) clinically translatable imaging method allows noninvasive monitoring metabolic pathways real time. method proven highly useful monitor Warburg effect cancer, MR detection increased HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate-to-lactate conversion. However, date, method never applied study neuroinflammation. Here, questioned potential (13)C MRSI HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate monitor presence neuroinflammatory lesions vivo cuprizone mouse model MS. First, demonstrated (13)C MRSI could detect significant increase HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, associated high density proinflammatory MPs. demonstrated increase HP [1-(13)C]lactate likely mediated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 up-regulation activated MPs, resulting regional pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition. Altogether, results demonstrate potential (13)C MRSI HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate neuroimaging method assessment inflammatory lesions. approach could prove useful MS also neurological diseases presenting inflammatory components.
