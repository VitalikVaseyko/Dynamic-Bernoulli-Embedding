 shown cases congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia (CNSHA) pyruvate kinase deficiency, primary defect may related diminished magnesium-stimulated ATPase activity, followed elevation erythrocyte ATP level. ATP end product glycolysis inhibits negative feedback control activities key glycolytic enzymes involved energy production, i.e. pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK). Erythrocyte-deficient PK, however, insensitive stimulating effect fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), normally positive effector PK. competing effectors, i.e. ATP FDP, seem show specific interaction. PK, inactive presence high concentrations ATP, seems lose sensitivity FDP. effect persists ATP molecules present excess. vitro incubation deficient PK ATPase resulted increased PK activity well recovery sensitivity stimulating effect FDP. effects obtained vivo administering magnesium levulinate intravenously CNSHA patients PK deficiency. may indicate magnesium ions stimulate deficient ATPase activity lead diminution ATP negative effector regulatory enzymes.
