 normal cells, heat shock response (HSR) rapidly induced response variety harmful conditions represents one efficient defense mechanism. cancer tissues, constitutive activation converts HSR life-threatening process, plays major role helping cell survival proliferation. Overexpression heat shock proteins (HSPs) widely reported human cancers found correlate tumor progression. Hepatocellular carcinoma one conditions HSR activation shown highest clinical significance. Transcription HSPs induced HSF-1, also activates glycolytic metabolism increases expression LDH-A, master regulator Warburg effect. paper, tried explore relationship HSR LDH-A. cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells, using two enzyme inhibitors (oxamate galloflavin), found reduction LDH-A activity led decreased level function major HSPs involved tumorigenesis. Galloflavin (a polyphenol) also inhibited ATPase activity two examined HSPs. Finally, hindering HSR markedly lowered alpha-fetoprotein cellular levels induced senescence. Specific inhibitors single HSPs currently evaluation different neoplastic diseases. However, one effects usually observed treatment compensatory elevation HSPs, decreases treatment efficacy. results highlight connection LDH HSR suggest LDH inhibition way globally impact tumor promoting process.
