 present study examined impact 48 h fast expression activation status SIRT1 GCN5, relationship SIRT1/GCN5 gene expression PGC-1alpha, PGC-1alpha target PDK4 skeletal muscle 10 lean healthy men (age, 22.0 +/- 1.5 years; peak oxygen uptake, 47.2 +/- 6.7 mL/(min.kg)). Muscle biopsies blood samples collected 1 h postprandial (Fed) following 48 h fasting (Fasted). Plasma insulin (Fed, 80.8 +/- 47.9 pmol/L; Fasted, detected) glucose (Fed, 4.36 +/- 0.86; Fasted, 3.74 +/- 0.25 mmol/L, p = 0.08) decreased, confirming participant adherence fasting. Gene expression PGC-1alpha decreased (p < 0.05, -24%), SIRT1 PDK4 increased (p < 0.05, +11% +1023%, respectively), GCN5 remained unchanged. changes observed whole-muscle protein expression SIRT1, GCN5, PGC-1alpha, COX IV. Phosphorylation SIRT1, AMPKalpha, ACC, p38 MAPK, PKA substrates well nuclear acetylation status also unaltered. Additionally, nuclear SIRT1 activity, GCN5, PGC-1alpha content remained unchanged. Preliminary findings derived regression analysis demonstrate changes nuclear GCN5 SIRT1 activity/phosphorylation may contribute control PGC-1alpha, PDK4, messenger RNA expression following fasting. Collectively, contrast previous animal studies, data inconsistent altered activation status SIRT1 GCN5 response 48 h fasting human skeletal muscle.
