 liver kinase B1 (LKB1) encoded tumor suppressor gene STK11, mutated Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients. Lkb1 plays indispensable roles energy homeostasis. However, Lkb1 regulates energy homeostasis vivo remains fully understood. found inactivation zebrafish Lkb1 upregulates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 expression inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex increasing phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase. result, glycolysis significantly enhanced indicated increased lactate production, resembles Warburg effect cancer cells. Inhibition Pdk2 lkb1 mutants dichloroacetate, promising anticancer drug, rescued lactate production wild-type level, suggesting lkb1 mutant may used screen compounds targeting aerobic glycolysis cancer therapy.
