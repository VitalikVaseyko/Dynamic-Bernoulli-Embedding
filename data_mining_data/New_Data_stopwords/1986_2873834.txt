 heat-activated chloroplast F1 ATPase hydrolyzes [3H, gamma-32P]ATP, followed removal medium ATP, ADP, Pi, enzyme labeled ATP, ADP, Pi bound equal amounts. total bound [3H]ADP [3H]ATP approaches 1 mol/mol enzyme. 30-min period, bound [32P]Pi falls off, bound [3H]ATP converted bound [3H]ADP. Enzyme remaining tightly bound ADP form bound ATP relatively high concentrations medium Pi either Mg2+ Ca2+ present. tightly bound ADP thus site retains catalytic capacity slow single-site ATP hydrolysis (or synthesis) likely site participates cooperative rapid net ATP hydrolysis. hydrolysis 50 microM [3H]ATP presence either Mg2+ Ca2+, enzyme steady-state level one bound [3H]ADP per mole enzyme. bound [3H]ATP also present, [3H]ADP regarded present two cooperating catalytic sites. formation levels bound ATP, ADP, Pi show reversal bound ATP hydrolysis occur either Ca2+ Mg2+ present. reveal phosphate oxygen exchange accompanies cleavage low ATP concentrations Ca2+ contrast Mg2+ heat-activated enzyme. Phosphate oxygen exchange occur either Mg2+ Ca2+ present low ATP concentrations hydrolyzed octyl glucoside activated ATPase. Ligand binding properties Ca2+ catalytic site rather lack reversible cleavage bound ATP may underlie lack oxygen exchange conditions.
