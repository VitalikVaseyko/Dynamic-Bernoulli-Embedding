 regulatory protein AlgR2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa positively regulates nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) succinyl-CoA synthetase, enzymes critical nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) formation. AlgR2 positively regulates production alginate, GTP, ppGpp inorganic polyphosphate (poly P). algR2 mutant low levels metabolites restored introducing overexpressing either algR2 ndk gene algR2 mutant. Thus, Ndk involved formation compounds largely prevents death algR2 mutant, occurs early stationary phase. demonstrate 12 kDa Ndk-pyruvate kinase (Pk) complex, previously shown generate predominantly GTP instead NTPs, low affinity deoxynucleoside diphosphates cannot generate dNTPs needed DNA replication cell division; complex may thus involved regulating levels NTPs dNTPs modulate cell division survival stationary phase.
