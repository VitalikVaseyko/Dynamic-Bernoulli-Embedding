 preparation pseudopentasaccharide 1a, inositol-phosphoglycan (IPG) contains conserved linear structure glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchors (GPI anchors), carried using highly convergent 2+3-block synthesis approach involves imidate sulfoxide glycosylation reactions. preferred solution conformation structure determined using NMR spectroscopy molecular dynamics simulations prior carrying quantitative structure--activity relationship studies connection insulin signalling process. ability 1a stimulate lipogenesis rat adipocytes well inhibit cAMP dependent protein kinase activate pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase investigated. Compound 1a show significant activity, may taken strong indication GPI anchors precursors IPG mediators.
