 maintenance oxygen homeostasis critical survival, master regulator process metazoan species hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), controls O(2) delivery utilization. conditions reduced O(2) availability, HIF-1 activates transcription genes, whose protein products mediate switch oxidative glycolytic metabolism. HIF-1 activated cancer cells result intratumoral hypoxia and/or genetic alterations. cancer cells, metabolism reprogrammed favor glycolysis even aerobic conditions. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) implicated cancer growth metabolism, although mechanism exerts effects unclear. Recent studies indicate PKM2 interacts HIF-1alpha physically functionally stimulate binding HIF-1 target genes, recruitment coactivators, histone acetylation, gene transcription. Interaction HIF-1alpha facilitated hydroxylation PKM2 proline-403 -408 PHD3. Knockdown PHD3 decreases glucose transporter 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 expression; decreases glucose uptake lactate production; increases O(2) consumption. effect PKM2/PHD3 limited genes encoding metabolic enzymes VEGF similarly regulated. results provide mechanism PKM2 promotes metabolic reprogramming suggest plays broader role cancer progression previously appreciated.
