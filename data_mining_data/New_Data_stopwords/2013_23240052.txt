 Clostridium acidurici anaerobic, homoacetogenic bacterium, able use purines uric acid sole carbon, nitrogen, energy source. Together two known purinolytic clostridia C. cylindrosporum C. purinilyticum, C. acidurici serves model organism investigation purine fermentation. Here, present first complete sequence analysis genome derived purinolytic Clostridium. genome C. acidurici 9a consists one chromosome (3,105,335 bp) one small circular plasmid (2,913 bp). lack candidate genes encoding glycine reductase indicates C. acidurici 9a uses energetically less favorable glycine-serine-pyruvate pathway glycine degradation. accordance specialized lifestyle corresponding narrow substrate spectrum C. acidurici 9a, number genes involved carbohydrate transport metabolism significantly lower clostridia C. acetobutylicum, C. saccharolyticum, C. beijerinckii. amino acid degraded C. acidurici glycine growth glycine occurs presence fermentable purine. Nevertheless, addition glycine resulted increased transcription levels genes encoding enzymes involved glycine-serine-pyruvate pathway serine hydroxymethyltransferase acetate kinase, whereas transcription levels formate dehydrogenase-encoding genes decreased. Sugars could utilized C. acidurici full genetic repertoire glycolysis detected. addition, genes encoding enzymes mediate resistance several antimicrobials metals identified. High resistance C. acidurici towards bacitracin, acriflavine azaleucine experimentally confirmed.
