 dynamic properties series vitro reaction systems increasing complexity containing phosphofructokinase central enzyme investigated. experimental strategy principal mathematical treatment elaborated search minimum requirements respect enzyme composition reaction system generating limit cycle behaviour. criterion, models developed permit experimental realization application specially designed flow-through equipment. addition phosphofructokinase, following enzymes stepwise included reaction systems composing Models 1 6: pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase. turned minimum dynamic system containing phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase well excesses adenylate kinase glucose 6-phosphate isomerase maintaining equilibrium conditions respective reacting species, acquires property limit cycle behaviour and, hence, generate sustained self-oscillations. approach permits compute region experimentally variable parameters (influx rates fructose 6-phosphate ATP, maximum rate pyruvate kianse) self-oscillatory behaviour predicted.
