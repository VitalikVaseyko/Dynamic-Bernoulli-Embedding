 Tenofovir (TFV) used combination antiretroviral drugs human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment prevention. TFV requires two phosphorylation steps become pharmacologically active; however, kinases activate TFV cells tissues susceptible HIV infection yet identified. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), vaginal, colorectal tissues transfected siRNA targeting nucleotide kinases, incubated TFV, TFV-monophosphate (TFV-MP) TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) measured using mass spectrometry-liquid chromatography. Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) performed first TFV phosphorylation step PBMC, vaginal, colorectal tissues. Interestingly, pyruvate kinase isozymes, muscle (PKM) liver red blood cell (PKLR), able phosphorylate TFV-MP TFV-DP PBMC vaginal tissue, creatine kinase, muscle (CKM) catalyzed conversion colorectal tissue. addition, next-generation sequencing Microbicide Trials Network MTN-001 clinical samples detected 71 previously unreported genetic variants genes encoding kinases. conclusion, results demonstrate TFV activated compartment-specific manner. Further, genetic variants identified could negatively impact TFV activation, thereby compromising TFV efficacy HIV treatment prevention.
