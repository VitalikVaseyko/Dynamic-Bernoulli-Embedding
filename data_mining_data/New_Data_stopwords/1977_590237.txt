 Differences action adenosine phosphates release intracellular enzymes human rat lymphocytes studied. protective effect ATP human cells found less rat cells. greatest discrepancy exhibited AMP exerted protective effect human lymphocytes, increased enzyme efflux rat lymphocytes. activities adenosine kinase, adenylate kinase, phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthetase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase creatine kinase compared cells species. Although significant differences observed, small suggest presence mechanism conversion AMP ATP human lymphocytes found rat cells. seems therefore protective effect exerted AMP human cells mediated conversion ATP, hence factor intracellular energy content concerned controlling release intracellular enzymes human cells.
