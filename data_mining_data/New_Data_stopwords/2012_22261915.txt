 measurement fecal tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (PKM2), overexpressed tumor cells, proposed novel tool detecting colorectal cancer (CRC). However, sensitivity specificity test varied among studies. aim meta-analysis determine diagnostic accuracy fecal PKM2 CRC evaluate utility CRC screening. compared guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) immunological fecal occult blood test (iFOBT). comprehensive literature search, 10 studies met inclusion criteria included. Summary estimates sensitivity specificity calculated using bivariate random effect model. hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve also undertaken. overall sensitivity specificity fecal PKM2 detecting CRC 79% (95% CI = 75-83%) 81% (95% CI = 73-87%), respectively. summary positive predictive value negative predictive value 74% (95% CI = 56-87%) 86% (95% CI = 79-91%), respectively. pooled diagnostic odds ratio 16 (95% CI = 10-26). head-to-head comparison, diagnostic odds ratio PKM2 gFOBT CRC 10.167 (95% CI = 5.992-17.250) 6.557 (95% CI = 3.467-12.403), respectively. diagnostic odds ratio PKM2 iFOBT CRC 9.542 (95% CI = 5.893-15.452) 67.248 (95% CI = 16.194-279.26), respectively. fecal PKM2 test diagnostic tool moderate sensitivity specificity detecting CRC. diagnostic efficiency similar gFOBT. relatively low specificity positive predict value, fecal PKM2 recommended used alone screening tool CRC.
