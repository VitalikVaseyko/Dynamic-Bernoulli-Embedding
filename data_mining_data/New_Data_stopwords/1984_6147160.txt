 1-, 2- 9-month-old rats adapted stock diet fed fat-free/high-sucrose diet, changes substrate effector levels glycolytic lipogenic enzymes liver, effects aging changes investigated. sucrose diet feeding, activities phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase fructokinase increased, whereas hexokinase activity markedly decreased. fructose 1-phosphate levels significantly increased liver, conversely, glucose 6-phosphate fructose 6-phosphate levels decreased. result sucrose diet feeding, changed enzyme activities would appear consistent metabolic pathway fructose predominant glucose. Consequently, concentrations acetyl-CoA, citrate malate increased would turn appear favour increase lipogenesis. changes substrate effector levels lipogenic enzymes reduced aging, enzyme activities. However, changes enzyme activities metabolite levels glycolysis much affected aging.
