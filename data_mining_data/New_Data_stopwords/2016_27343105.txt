 Hypoxia, depending upon magnitude circumstances, evokes spectrum mild severe acid-base changes ranging alkalosis acidosis, alter many responses hypoxia non-genomic genomic levels, part via altered hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) metabolism. Healthy people high altitude persons hyperventilating non-hypoxic stimuli become alkalotic alkalemic arterial pH acutely rising high 7.7. Hypoxia-mediated respiratory alkalosis reduces sympathetic tone, blunts hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction hypoxic cerebral vasodilation, increases hemoglobin oxygen affinity. effects others salutary counterproductive tissue oxygen delivery utilization, based upon magnitude effect summation. severe hypoxia either setting profound arterial hemoglobin desaturation reduced O2 content poor perfusion (ischemia) global local level, metabolic hypercapnic acidosis develop along considerable lactate formation pH falling 6.8. Although conventionally considered injurious deleterious cell function survival, acidoses may cytoprotective various anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic mechanisms limit total hypoxic ischemic-reperfusion injury. Attempts correct acidosis giving bicarbonate alkaline agents circumstances ahead concurrent reoxygenation efforts may ill advised. Better understanding so-called "pH paradox" permissive acidosis may offer therapeutic possibilities. Rapidly growing cancers often outstrip vascular supply compromising oxygen nutrient delivery metabolic waste disposal, thus limiting growth metastatic potential. However, excessive glycolysis lactate formation may necessarily represent oxygen insufficiency, rather Warburg effect-an attempt provide large amount small carbon intermediates supply many synthetic pathways proliferative cell growth. either case, expression upregulation many genes involved acid-base homeostasis, part HIF-1 signaling. include unique isoform carbonic anhydrase (CA-IX) numerous membrane acid-base transporters engaged maintain optimal intracellular extracellular pH maximal growth. Inhibition proteins gene suppression may important therapeutic application cancer chemotherapy.
