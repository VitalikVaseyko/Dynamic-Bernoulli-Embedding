 fluxes CO(2) oxygen photosynthesis cell suspensions Tessellaria volvocina Mallomonas papillosa monitored mass spectrometrically. rapid uptake CO(2,) slow drawdown compensation concentrations 26 muM T. volvocina 18 muM M. papillosa, O(2) evolution ceased, indicating lack active bicarbonate uptake cells. Darkening cells period photosynthesis cause rapid release CO(2), indicating absence intracellular inorganic carbon pool. However, upon darkening brief burst CO(2) observed similar post-illumination burst characteristic C(3) higher plants. Treatment cells species membrane-permeable carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxyzolamide adverse effect photosynthetic rate, stimulated dark CO(2) burst indicating dark oxidation compound formed light. absence active accumulation inorganic carbon photosynthesis species inhibited O(2). investigated four synurophyte species T. volvocina, M. papillosa, Synura petersenii, Synura uvella: photosynthetic O(2) evolution rates four algae, measured O(2) electrode, significantly higher (40-50%) media low O(2) (4%) air-equilibrated (21% O(2)) media, indicating O(2) inhibition photosynthesis (Warburg effect) thus occurrence photorespiration species.
