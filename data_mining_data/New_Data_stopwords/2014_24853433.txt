 Cellular senescence state irreversible growth arrest; however, metabolic processes senescent cells remain active. previous studies shown radiation induces senescence human breast cancer cells display low expression securin, protein involved control metaphase-anaphase transition anaphase onset. study, protein expression profile senescent cells resolved two-dimensional gel electrophoresis investigate associated metabolic alterations. found radiation induced expression activation glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase important role glycolysis. activity lactate dehydrogenase A, involved conversion pyruvate lactate, release lactate acidification extracellular environment, also induced. Inhibition glycolysis dichloroacetate attenuated radiation-induced senescence. addition, radiation also induced activation 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways promote senescence. also found radiation increased expression monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) facilitates export lactate extracellular environment. Inhibition glycolysis AMPK/NF-kappaB signalling pathways reduced MCT1 expression rescued acidification extracellular environment. Interestingly, metabolic-altering signalling pathways also involved radiation-induced invasion surrounding, non-irradiated breast cancer normal endothelial cells. Taken together, radiation induce senescence human breast cancer cells metabolic alterations.
