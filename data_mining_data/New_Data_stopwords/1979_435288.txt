 hepatocyte haematopoietic cell contents liver foetal guinea pig measured latter half gestation. Hepatocytes represented 30% liver volume mid-gestation increased 70-80% term; cell volume remained fairly constant 5-7 days term, doubled. Haematopoietic cells represented 5% liver volume mid-gestation progressively fell <1% term. 75% gestation hepatocytes haematopoietic cells prepared perfused foetal livers collagenase digestion. Enzyme activity hepatocyte was, without exception, similar whole liver. general, enzyme activity haematopoietic cells similar erythrocytes, relatively low values aldolase, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, ;malic' enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase aspartate aminotransferase. haematopoietic cell contribution total enzyme activity foetal liver usually much less 10% could thus account major changes hepatic enzyme activity latter half gestation. Hepatocytes contained hexokinase isoenzymes III, aldolase isoenzymes B pyruvate kinase isoenzymes 1, 2 4. haematopoietic cells contained hexokinase isoenzyme two additional bands activity slightly greater mobility, aldolase isoenzyme pyruvate kinase isoenzymes 2 4.
