 Shallow-living marine invertebrates use free amino acids cellular osmolytes, teleosts use almost organic osmolytes. Recently found unusual osmolyte compositions deep-sea animals. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) increases depth muscles teleosts, skates, crustaceans (up 300 mmol/kg 2900 m). deep-sea animals high levels (1). scyllo-inositol echinoderms, gastropods, polychaetes, (2). polyol plus beta-alanine betaine octopods, (3). hypotaurine, N-methyltaurine, unidentified methylamines vestimentiferans hydrothermal vents cold seeps, (4). depth-correlated serine-phosphate osmolyte vesicomyid clams trench seeps. hypothesize solutes counteract effects hydrostatic pressure. lactate dehydrogenase, actin, pyruvate kinase, 250 mM TMAO (but glycine) protected ligand binding protein stability pressure. test TMAO living cells, grew yeast pressure. 1 h 71 MPa, 3.5 h 71 MPa, 17 h 30 MPa, 150 mM TMAO generally doubled number cells formed colonies. Sulfur-based osmolytes correlated depth, hypotaurine thiotaurine, probably involved sulfide metabolism detoxification. Thus deep-sea osmolytes may least two roles beyond acting simple compatible osmotica.
