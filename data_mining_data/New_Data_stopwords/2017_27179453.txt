 Emerging evidence indicates complex interplay metabolism chronic disorders nervous system. particular, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase (PDK)-lactic acid axis critical link connects metabolic reprogramming pathophysiology neurological disorders. PDKs, via regulation PDH complex activity, orchestrate conversion pyruvate either aerobically acetyl-CoA, anaerobically lactate. kinases also involved neurometabolic dysregulation pathological conditions. Lactate, energy substrate neurons, also recently acknowledged signaling molecule involved neuronal plasticity, neuron-glia interactions, neuroimmune communication, nociception. recently, PDK-lactic acid axis recognized modulate neuronal glial phenotypes activities, contributing pathophysiologies diverse neurological disorders. review covers recent advances implicate PDK-lactic acid axis novel linker metabolism diverse neuropathophysiologies. finally explore possibilities employing PDK-lactic acid axis downstream mediators putative future therapeutic strategies aimed prevention treatment neurological disorders.
