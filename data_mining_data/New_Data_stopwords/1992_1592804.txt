 pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) gene Escherichia coli transcribed seven promoters coordinately induced 12- 15-fold anaerobiosis. FNR protein plays major role anaerobic control system. mutation fnr gene, however, reduces anaerobic induction fivefold, indicating FNR factor involved anaerobic activation process (Sawers Bock, J. Bacteriol. 171:2485-2498, 1989). residual anaerobic induction could shown imparted transcriptional regulator ArcA; arcA fnr double mutant incapable inducing pfl transcription anaerobically. mutant strain unable synthesize membrane-associated histidine kinase (ArcB) proposed activate ArcA showed phenotype arcA mutant strain, indicating functional ArcB protein also required wild-type, anaerobic pfl transcriptional activation. Nuclease S1 analysis revealed arcA mutation abolished anaerobic transcription promoter 7 reduced expression promoter 6 affect transcription promoters 1 5. hand, fnr mutation prevented anaerobic expression promoters 6 7 reduced transcription promoters 1 5. data indicate ArcA FNR essential anaerobic activation promoter 7 transcription, suggests functional interaction proteins.
