 mutant form pyruvate kinase (PK) red blood cells consanguineous family severe non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia characterized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification sequencing. variant enzyme named PK Mondor, according recommendations International Committee Standardisation Haematology. propositus lacked PK activity low level PK activity found resulted likely PK-M2 (fetal isozyme) expression red blood cells propositus. PK Mondor corresponds frameshift mutation deletion one G repetition four Gs positions 1231-1234. family, whose first child stillborn whose second homozygous frameshift mutation, requested prenatal diagnosis third pregnancy. Diagnosis made chorionic biopsy specific approach combining PCR amplification restriction enzyme digestion.
