 effect cellular creatine (Cr) adenine nucleotides (AdN) deficiency cardiac work, ATP turnover rate flux creatine kinase (CK) investigated. Depletion 60-65% total heart AdN 2-deoxyglucose treatment presence pyruvate subsequent washout resulted 25% decrease contractile activity phosphocreatine level. Substitution 80-90% heart Cr (and PCr) guanidinopropionic acid (GP) feeding rats 1% GP diet reduced maximal values cardiac work, ATP turnover flux CK 40-50% elevated end diastolic pressure index diastolic stiffness. Hearts depleted AdN glycogen showed better post-ischemic recovery mechanical function attributed restriction accumulation ischemic catabolytes (lactate, H+, Pi). data imply myocardium PCr essential high energy phosphate contractile function stays unchanged significantly reduced ATP levels.
