 trivalent cation aluminum cause chronic cytotoxicity plants, animals microorganisms. suggested Al interaction cell membranes enzyme metal binding sites may involved Al cytotoxicity. study, binding Al microsomes liposomes found lipid dependent signal transduction element phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate highest affinity Al Al:lipid stoichiometry 1:1. Al binding reduced presence high concentrations Ca2+ (> 1 mM). citrate and, lesser extent, malate capable preventing Al lipid binding, consistent involvement organic acids recently described Al detoxification mechanism plants. effects AICl3, Al-citrate ZnSO4 metal-dependent enzyme activities (enolase, pyruvate kinase, H+-ATPase, myosin, Calpain, proteinase K, phospholipase A2 arginase) assayed vitro. Zn2+ capable inhibiting enzymes except H+-ATPase, AlCl3 Al-citrate minimal effects except phospholipase A2 interaction AlCl3 occurred. However, could negated addition citrate. results indicate that, contrary current hypotheses, toxic mode Al interaction enzymatic catalytic metal binding sites may interaction specific membrane lipids.
