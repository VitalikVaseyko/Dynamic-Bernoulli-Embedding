 glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze formation plant cell wall carbohydrates remain biochemically characterized. achieved specific assays available enzymes. present protocol vitro assays processive nonprocessive membrane-bound GTs. assays either based use radioactive nucleotide sugars (NDP sugars; e.g., UDP-[U-(14)C]glucose) quantification radiolabeled monosaccharides incorporated soluble insoluble carbohydrates, coupling GT reaction pyruvate kinase (PK) oxidation NADH lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). radiometric assays suitable exploratory work poorly characterized enzymes, whereas spectrophotometric assays require availability highly enriched GTs. assays performed within 1 d, depending number fractions assayed reaction mixtures tested.
