 multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, frequently observed cancer treatment, often associated drug efflux pump activity. However, many factors also known involved. Cancer cells often rely aerobic glycolysis energy production; known "Warburg effect" used survival mechanism. Associated event, reverse pH gradient across cell membrane occurs, leading cytosol alkalinization extracellular acidification. present study, investigated role different mechanisms involved MDR, altered tumor microenvironment energetic metabolism. breast cancer cell line MCF-7, used model, exposed two widely used antitumor drugs, paclitaxel (antimitotic agent) doxorubicin (alkylating agent). Cancer pH regulation shown crucial malignant characteristics cell migration drug resistance. results showed lower extracellular pH induced higher migratory capacity higher resistance studied chemotherapeutical compounds MCF-7 cells. Besides influence extracellular pH, role tumor metabolism MDR phenotype also investigated. Pre-treatment different bioenergetic modulators led cell ATP depletion altered lactic acid production glucose consumption, resulting increased sensitivity paclitaxel doxorubicin. Overall, study supports potential use compounds targeting cell metabolism tumor microenvironment factors pH, co-adjuvants conventional chemotherapy.
