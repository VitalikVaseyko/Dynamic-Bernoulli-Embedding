 Two new adenine nucleotide analogues synthesized characterized: 6-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-6-deaminoadenosine 5'-monophosphate 5'-diphosphate. bromoketo dioxobutyl moieties ability react nucleophilic side chains several amino acids, well arginine. 6-[(4-Bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-6-deaminoadenosine 5'-monophosphate reacts irreversibly rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, causing inactivation. Addition ADP reaction mixture (in presence Mg2+) markedly decreases rate inactivation. Pig heart NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase allosterically activated ADP, reduces Km isocitrate. 6-[(4-Bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-6-deaminoadenosine 5'-diphosphate reacts irreversibly isocitrate dehydrogenase, causing, rapidly, loss ability ADP increase initial velocity assays conducted low isocitrate concentrations and, slowly, inactivation. Addition ADP reaction mixture (in presence Mn2+) protects enzyme loss allosteric activation. proposed 6-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]-6-deaminoadenine nucleotides react active site pyruvate kinase ADP activating site isocitrate dehydrogenase compounds may general applicability affinity labels catalytic regulatory adenine nucleotide sites proteins.
