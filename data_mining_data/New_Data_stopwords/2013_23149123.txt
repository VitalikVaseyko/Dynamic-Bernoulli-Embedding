 Pseudomonas putida KT2440, microbial cell factory reference industrial whole-cell biocatalysis, unable support biochemical reactions occur anoxic conditions, limiting utility large number relevant biotransformations. Unlike (facultative) anaerobes, P. putida resorts NADH oxidation via oxic respiratory chain completely lacks true fermentation metabolism. Therefore, cannot achieve correct balances energy redox couples (i.e., ATP/ADP NADH/NAD(+)) required sustain O(2)-free lifestyle. overcome state affairs, acetate kinase (ackA) gene facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) genes aerotolerant Zymomonas mobilis knocked-in wild-type P. putida strain. Biochemical genetic assays showed conditional expression entire enzyme set allowed engineered bacteria adopt anoxic regime maintained considerable metabolic activity. resulting strain exploited host heterologous expression 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene degradation pathway recruited Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, enabling recombinants degrade recalcitrant chlorinated compound anoxically. results underscore value P. putida versatile agent biotransformations able function progressively lower redox statuses.
