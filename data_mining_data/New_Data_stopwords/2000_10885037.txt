 influence thyroxine activities enzymes energy metabolism (hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase) investigated bone marrow myeloid cells blood neutrophils 3-10-day old neonatal piglets. Data obtained suggest different responsiveness energy metabolism enzymes thyroxine action. Repeated hormone injections resulted preferential stimulation enzymes involved oxidative stages carbohydrate catabolism animal myelocaryocytes, activities anaerobic enzymes cells less affected. time glycolytic enzymes neutrophil granulocytes showed higher sensitivity thyroxine action enzymes catalyzing oxidative stages energy metabolism.
