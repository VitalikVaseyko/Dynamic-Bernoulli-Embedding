 Preincubation rat hepatocytes EGF (epidermal growth factor) caused stimulation gluconeogenesis alanine. effect maximal preincubation 20 min, half-maximal effect EGF obtained 10 nM. EGF also stimulated gluconeogenesis lactate asparagine, glutamine proline. Preincubation hepatocytes EGF caused stable inactivation pyruvate kinase, may account, least part, observed effects EGF gluconeogenesis.
