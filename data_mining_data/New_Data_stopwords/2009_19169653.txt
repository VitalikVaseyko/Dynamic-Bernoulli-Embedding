 Treatment rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase iron/ascorbate caused inactivation cleavage peptide bond. inactivation fragmentation enzyme prevented addition Mg2+, catalase, mannitol, ADP PEP substrates show effect. Protective effect catalase mannitol suggests hydroxyl radical produced ferrous ion-dependent reduction oxygen responsible inactivation/fragmentation enzyme. SDS-PAGE TOF-MS analysis confirmed five pairs fragments, determined result cleavage Lys114-Gly115, Glu117-Ile118, Asp177-Gly178, Gly207-Val208, Phe243-Ile244 bonds enzyme amino-terminal sequencing analysis. Protection enzyme Mg2+ implies identical binding sites Fe2+ Mg2+, cleavage sites discriminated cofactor Mg2+-binding sites. Considering amino acid residues interacting metal ions tertiary structure, Fe2+ ion may bind Asp177 neighboring Gly207 Glu117 neighboring Lys114 Phe243, causing peptide cleavage hydroxyl radical. Iron-dependent oxidative inactivation/fragmentation pyruvate kinase explain decreased glycolytic flux aerobic conditions. Intracellular free Mg2+ concentrations responsible control cellular respiration glycolysis.
