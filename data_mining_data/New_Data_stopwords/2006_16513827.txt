 IGF-I insulin structurally related polypeptides mediate similar pattern biological effects via receptors display considerably homology. Administration recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) proven improve glucose control liver muscle insulin sensitivity patients type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). effect rhIGF-I treatment evaluated mouse model type 2 DM (MKR mouse), expresses dominant-negative form human IGF-I receptor control muscle creatine kinase promoter specifically skeletal muscle. MKR mice impaired IGF-I insulin signaling skeletal muscle, leading severe insulin resistance muscle, liver, fat, developing type 2 DM 5 wk age. Six-week-old MKR mice treated either saline rhIGF-I 3 wk. Blood glucose levels decreased response rhIGF-I treatment MKR mice. rhIGF-I treatment also increased body weight MKR concomitant changes body composition decrease fat mass increase lean body mass. Insulin, fatty acid, triglyceride levels affected rhIGF-I, insulin glucose tolerance MKR mice. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis demonstrated improvement overall insulin sensitivity. Pyruvate glutamine tolerance tests proved decrease rate glucose appearance MKR mice treated rhIGF-I, suggesting reduction gluconeogenic capacity liver, kidney, small intestine. Taken together results demonstrate improvement hyperglycemia achieved inhibition gluconeogenesis rather improvement insulin sensitivity. Also, results suggest functional IGF-I receptor skeletal muscle required IGF-I improve insulin sensitivity mouse model type 2 DM.
