 BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) key central metabolism intermediate participates glucose transport, precursor several biosynthetic pathways involved allosteric regulation glycolytic enzymes. work generated W3110 derivative strains lack main PEP consumers PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS-) pyruvate kinase isozymes PykA PykF (PTS-pykA- PTS-pykF-). characterize effects modifications cell physiology, carbon flux distribution aromatics production capacity determined. RESULTS: compared reference strain W3110, strain VH33 (PTS-) displayed lower specific rates growth, glucose consumption acetate production well higher biomass yield glucose. phenotypic effects even pronounced additional inactivation PykA PykF. Carbon flux analysis revealed PTS inactivation causes redirection metabolic flux towards biomass formation. cycle involving PEP carboxylase (Ppc) PEP carboxykinase (Pck) detected strains. strains W3110, VH33 (PTS-) VH35 (PTS-, pykF-), net flux cycle inversely correlated specific rate glucose consumption inactivation Pck strains caused reduction growth rate. PTS- background, inactivation PykA caused reduction Ppc Pck cycling well reduction flux TCA, whereas inactivation PykF caused increase anaplerotic flux PEP OAA increased flux TCA. wild-type mutant strains modified overproduce L-phenylalanine. resting cells experiments, compared reference strain, 10, 4 7-fold higher aromatics yields glucose observed consequence PTS, PTS PykA PTS PykF inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic flux analysis performed strains lacking main activities generating pyruvate PEP revealed high degree flexibility perturbations central metabolic network E. coli. observed responses reduced glucose uptake PEP pyruvate rate conversion caused PTS, PykA PykF inactivation included flux rerouting several central metabolism nodes towards anabolic biosynthetic reactions, thus compensating carbon limitation mutant strains. detected cycle involving Ppc Pck found required maintaining specific growth glucose consumption rates studied strains. Strains VH33 (PTS-), VH34 (PTS-pykA-) VH35 (PTS-pykF-) useful properties biotechnological processes, increased PEP availability high biomass yields glucose, making useful production aromatic compounds recombinant proteins.
