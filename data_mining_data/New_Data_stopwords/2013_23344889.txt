 BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia severe wasting syndrome characterized progressive loss lean body mass systemic inflammation. Inhibiting signaling transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) largely prevents cancer-induced muscle wasting murine models. previously shown utility Compound A, highly selective novel NF-kappaB inhibitor targets IkappaB kinase complex, provide clinical benefit cancer-induced skeletal muscle cardiac atrophy. METHODS: Using metabolomics approach, describe changes found cachectic noncachectic gastrocnemius muscles Compound treatment various doses. RESULTS: 234 metabolites gastrocnemius, cachexia-induced changes gastrocnemius metabolism reset steady-state abundances 42 metabolites (p < 0.05). changes, evenly distributed across biochemical categories, concentrated amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates energetics intermediates, lipids. gastrocnemius glycolytic pathway markedly altered-changes consistent tumor Warburg physiology. first account Warburg effect exclusively restricted cancer cells rapidly proliferating nonmalignant cells. Cachectic gastrocnemius also displays tricarboxylic acid cycle disruptions, signs oxidative stress, impaired redox homeostasis. Compound partially rescues phenotype cachectic gastrocnemius, failing restore gastrocnemius' baseline metabolic profile. CONCLUSIONS: findings present manuscript enumerate metabolic consequences cachexia gastrocnemius demonstrate NF-kB targeted treatment partly rescues cachectic metabolic phenotype. data strengthen previous findings metabolomic characterization serum cachectic animals, suggesting many metabolic alterations observed blood originate diseased muscle. findings provide significant insight complex pathophysiology cancer cachexia provide objective criteria evaluating future therapeutics.
