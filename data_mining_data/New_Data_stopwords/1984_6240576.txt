 Five-year multidisciplinary study longevity Georgian SSR made possible select two populations (Abkhazian Imeretian), indices longevity much higher, average level rural population whole region. distribution polymorphic systems red cell enzymes (adenilate kinase, esterase D, phosphoglucomutase I, acid phosphatase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glyoxalase I, lactate dehydrogenase, adenosine deaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, phosphohexose isomerase) serum proteins (haptoglobin, Gc-component transferrin) studied genetic analysis populations. results indicate studied loci observed genotypic frequencies populations distributed according Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. genetic comparison studied populations neighbouring populations reveal genetic peculiarities populations concord scheme anthropological types Hither Asia. study age-related changes gene frequencies heterozygosity showed age-related fluctuations genetic indices age groups, heterogeneous nature deviations indicate may result random genetic processes.
