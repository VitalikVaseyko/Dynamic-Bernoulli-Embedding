 Data presented suggest enzyme sequence similarities among species solely function evolutionary relationship. demonstrated sequence similarities glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, phosphoglycerate kinases, pyruvate kinases yeast, bacteria, mammals bird possess significant species optimal thriving temperature dependence crosses conventional phylogenetic divisions. therefore suggested species distantly related evolutionarily may possess degree enzyme sequence similarity happen thrive near optimal temperature; conversely, organisms closely related evolutionarily function radically different temperatures possess sequence dissimilarity may mask close relatedness.
