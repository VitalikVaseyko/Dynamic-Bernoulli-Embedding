 Cancer cells uptake glucose higher rate produce lactic acid rather metabolizing pyruvate tricarboxylic acid cycle. adaptive metabolic shift termed Warburg effect. Recently progress made regarding mechanistic understanding glucose metabolism associated diagnostic therapeutic methods, investigated colorectal cancer. majority novel mechanisms involve important glucose metabolism associated genes miRNA regulation. present review discusses contribution research results facilitate development novel diagnosis anticancer treatment options.
