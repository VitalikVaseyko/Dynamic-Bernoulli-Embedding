 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity measured rat pancreatic islet cytosol mitochondria. carboxykinase activity detected variety conditions, including increase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity nonislet tissues, starving animals incubating islet extracts Fe2+ Mn2+ assaying enzyme activity. amounts islet cytosol protein used exceeded liver companion assays used controls. calculated islet phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity 0.005 liver, 1 X 10(-5) high pyruvate kinase activity islets, detected assays used. Ferroactivator protein permits Fe2+ activate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ubiquitous many tissues even contain carboxykinase. Ferroactivator activity detectable pancreatic islets. Pyruvate kinase, enzyme catalyzes reaction essentially opposite catalyzed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (i.e., phosphoenolpyruvate formation), plentiful islet cytosol. Therefore, even phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity present pancreatic islets, low unlikely phosphoenolpyruvate formation would favored contribution carboxykinase intracellular carbohydrate metabolism must quantitatively unimportant.
