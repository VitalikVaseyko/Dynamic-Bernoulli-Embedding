 Since previously reported IL-2 profound circadian dependent effects upon DNA synthesis liver mice (Scheving et al., 1988; Tsai et al., 1988) effects IL-2 enzyme activities studied. objective determine effect IL-2 administered different times mice fed ad libitum, standardized 12 h light alternating 12 h dark. Three groups injected intraperitoneally either 1 4 mg/kg IL-2, one group given vehicle only. treatment time dose vehicle 2 h light one group 2 h dark span. Subgroups 5 mice killed 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30 h treatment, livers taken frozen await preparation analysis enzyme activities standard procedures. treatment light span IL-2 statistically significant effect enzymes lipid, carbohydrate amino acid metabolism. contrary treatment given dark span IL-2 produced statistically significant increases enzymes glycolysis, lipid synthesis beginning 8 h treatment (changes ranged 20 43%) higher lower doses (higher doses always yielded higher activities), activities continued increase 24 h post-treatment span (changes ranged 42 64%). 30 h, activities returning normal levels. Amino acid metabolism, hand, decreased post-treatment times (the range decrease 18 44%). Thus, report first time duration time, pathway affected, well magnitude effect seen dosage IL-2 circadian-stage dependent even two time point samplings. believe, however, two time points represent different critical extremes liver metabolism, studies denser sampling planned.
