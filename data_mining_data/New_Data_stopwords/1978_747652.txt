 Hepatocytes isolated livers fed rats used comparative study effects phenylephrine, vasopressin glucagon gluconeogenesis enzymes glycogen metabolism. hepatocytes incubated presence Ca(2+), phenylephrine stimulated gluconeogenesis pyruvate less glucagon, but, contrast hormone, affect activities protein kinase pyruvate kinase, concentration phosphoenolpyruvate, decrease release (3)H(2)O [6-(3)H]glucose. effects vasopressin similar phenylephrine. Gluconeogenesis fructose also stimulated phenylephrine and, markedly, glucagon expense conversion fructose lactate. Insulin able antagonize stimulatory effect phenylephrine gluconeogenesis pyruvate. Ca(2+) removed incubation medium, phenylephrine still stimulated gluconeogenesis pyruvate, also caused activation protein kinase inactivation pyruvate kinase; accordingly, concentration phosphoenolpyruvate increased, and, contrast, vasopressin effect parameters. property phenylephrine cause activation glycogen phosphorylase decreased glucose absence Ca(2+); abolished two conditions combined. Glycogen synthase inactivated phenylephrine presence absence Ca(2+), although presumably different mechanisms.
