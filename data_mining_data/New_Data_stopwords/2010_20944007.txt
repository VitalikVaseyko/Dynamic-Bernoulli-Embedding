 study uses two independent genetic strategies explore requirement phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) development mature cell populations CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes. data show CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes express PDK1 express catalytically inactive PDK1 mutant fail produce mature invariant Valpha14 NKT cells differentiate conventional CD4, CD8, regulatory cell subsets thymus. PDK1 requirement Valpha14 NKT cell development reflects cells require PDK1 substrate protein kinase B meet metabolic demands proliferative expansion response IL-15 AgR stimulation. also constitutive PDK1 signaling conventional alpha/beta cells required lineage commitment cells fine-tunes expression coreceptors adhesion molecules. Also, although PDK1 dispensable thymic development conventional alpha/beta cells, peripheral cells reduced substantially. reflects PDK1 requirement lymphopenia-induced proliferation, process necessary initial population peripheral cell niche neonatal mice. PDK1 thus indispensable cell developmental programs, timing PDK1 requirement unique different cell subpopulations.
