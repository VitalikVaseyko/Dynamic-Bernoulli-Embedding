 Proteolysis hexokinase cell-free systems prepared rabbit reticulocytes shown previously ATP-dependent apparently mediated ubiquitin system (Magnani et al. J. Biol.Chem.261, 8327-8333). investigated phenomenon, found substantial loss hexokinase cell-free systems prepared fresh lysates. Storage lysates -20 degrees C addition free radical generating system required demonstrate rapid ATP-dependent decay. appears initial oxidative damage hexokinase abolish activity allows recognized ATP-dependent proteolytic system. relevance mechanism vivo degradation hexokinase discussed.
