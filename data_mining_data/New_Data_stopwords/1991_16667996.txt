 role mitochondria phosphorylation ADP ATP early steps seed germination studied. Mitochondria extracted dry sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seeds. Adenylate kinase-dependent ATP synthesis inhibited p(1),p(5)-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate. Synthesis ATP observed different substrates: citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate, pyruvate NADH. synthesis activated cytochrome c, inhibited cyanide, oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, carboxyatractyloside. ATP/O values succinate 0.85 1.2 absence presence, respectively, cytochrome c. Electron micrographs showed mitochondria dry tissues different structures observed situ vitro aqueous extraction, suggesting profound changes occurred contact aqueous medium. results confirm previous data obtained vivo showing mitochondria present dry seeds able synthesize ATP soon seeds rehydrated.
