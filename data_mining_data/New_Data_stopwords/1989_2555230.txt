 1. Anaerobic glycolysis intact bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei brucei studied. 2. Fructose, glucose mammose aerobically catabolized rates 3.4, 3.0 2.5 anaerobically rates 0.38, 2.75 2.35 mumol hexose/hr/10(8) trypanosomes respectively. 3. Glycerol 3-phosphate ADP accumulated approximately level anaerobic catabolism three hexoses. However, fructose catabolism stopped within 15-20 min addition glucose already immobilized trypanosomes temporarily caused rapid characteristic drop glycerol 3-phosphate level rate 40 nmol/min/10(8) trypanosomes correspondingly glucose 6-phosphate, glycerol pyruvate levels raised. 4. observations consistent proposed requirements reverse glycerol kinase anaerobic net ATP production. Instead, propose glycerol 3-phosphate:glucose transphosphorylase catalyses formation glycerol glucose 6-phosphate.
