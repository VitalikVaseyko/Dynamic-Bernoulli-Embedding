 OBJECTIVE: aim meta-analysis evaluate diagnosis value tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) stool biomarker diagnosis colorectal cancer. MATERIALS METHODS: searching databases Cochrane Library, PubMed, China national knowledge Information Wanfang, diagnosis study related tumor M2-PK stool biomarker diagnosis colorectal cancer screened included study. pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (+LR), negative likelihood ratio (-LR) receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) calculated stata 11.0 software. RESULTS: According including criteria, 14 trials including 1990 subjects finally included meta-analysis. pooled diagnosis sensitivity, specificity, +LR, -LR area curve 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.81), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76-0.79), 4.38 (95% CI: 3.27-5.88), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.23-0.34) 0.86 (95% CI: 0.834-0.89). statistical publication bias found study. CONCLUSION: Tumor M2-PK stool useful biomarker diagnosis colorectal cancer relative high sensitivity specificity.
