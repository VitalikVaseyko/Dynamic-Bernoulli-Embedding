 bioactivities RRR-alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-tocopherol (T) R-alpha-tocotrienol (R-alpha-TT) determined rat resorption-gestation tests. ranking order RRR-alpha-T greater RRR-beta-T greater RRR-gamma-T greater equal R-alpha-TT greater RRE-delta-T. Accordingly, biopotency palm-oil residue assessed expressed alpha-tocopherol equivalents (alpha-TEs). release pyruvate kinase, variable nutrition-linked necrotizing myopathy, plasma dose-dependently inhibited RRR-alpha-T standard corresponding alpha-TE residue. Prostacyclin synthesis aorta segments induced thrombin ionomycin higher spontaneous release. However, difference depleted group groups treated RRR-alpha-T alpha-TEs palm-oil residue. Quantities IgG plasma vitamin E-depleted rats highest. Upon supplementation RRR-alpha-T alpha-TEs palm-oil residue, reduced IgG concentrations observed, similar animals commercial diet containing adequate amounts vitamin E.
