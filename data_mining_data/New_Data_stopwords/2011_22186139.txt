 c-Myc frequently overexpressed tumors plays important role regulation cancer metabolism. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1), master regulator hypoxic response, enhances tumorigenesis influences metabolism via upregulation glycolytic pathway suppression mitochondrial respiration. Together, deregulated Myc HIF1 cooperate lend metabolic advantages proliferating cancer cells contribute Warburg effect. show overexpression Myc significantly stabilizes alpha subunit HIF1 (HIF1alpha) normoxic conditions enhances HIF1alpha accumulation hypoxic conditions cells. Posttranscriptional regulation HIF1alpha Myc led induction HIF1alpha gene targets. Normoxic HIF1alpha protein expression also dependent Myc. Functionally, HIF1alpha expression required Myc-induced anchorage-independent growth cell proliferation. Myc-dependent stabilization HIF1alpha involved either disruption binding VHL complex posttranslational protein modifications. Taken together, findings uncover previously uncharacterized regulatory relationship Myc HIF1 important implications cancer metabolism development.
