 Tyrosine phosphorylation (p-Y105) pyruvate kinase (PK) M2, recent years, suggested facilitate Warburg effect tumor cell growth. However, comparison structural dynamics un-phosphorylated, active, phosphorylated-at-Y105, inactive-states, clear. studied molecular dynamics two states unravel features, phosphorylated PKM2 showed rapid global conformation change initial stages simulation. overall simulation identified phosphorylation event results buried less flexible PKM2 conformation, compared un-phosphorylated form, resulting open closed conformation active site un-phosphorylated phosphorylated forms, respectively, due movement B domain. conformational shift Y105-phosphorylated-PKM2 (p-Y105-PKM2) closed active site, responsible inhibition PKM2 activity, outcome bending residues (117-118, 218-219, 296-297, 301-308) within loop connecting B domains presence helix-loop-helix motif domain. un-phosphorylated PKM2 formed helix bend (H4) due less fluctuation residue S-100; end helix (H4) connected substrate binding pocket. Further, simulation analysis showed phosphorylation affect FBP binding predominantly. propose p-Y105 inhibits activity PKM2 without influencing FBP binding directly allowing open binding conformation influencing G128, S100, G506 gamma turn, G126 S127 residues. Phosphorylated PKM2 also identified gain transcriptional factor function case un-phosphorylated form. structurally important residues PKM2 could bearing cancer metabolism, since PKM2 implicated promotion cancer recent past.
