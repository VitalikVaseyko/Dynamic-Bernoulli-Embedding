 sequence gene encoding pyruvate kinase Saccharomyces cerevisiae re-determined failures oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis experiments involving region thought contain string five contiguous non-preferred codons. region found difficult sequence shown three extra bases compared published sequence [(1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2193-2201]. revised sequence demonstrates yeast pyruvate kinase gene cluster non-preferred codons, therefore example class genes possibly exhibit translational control presence non-preferred codons.
