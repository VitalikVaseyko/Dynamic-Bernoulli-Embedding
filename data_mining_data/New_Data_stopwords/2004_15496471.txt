 Carbohydrate response element (ChRE)-binding protein (ChREBP) recently discovered transcription factor activated response high glucose concentrations liver independently insulin. ChREBP first identified ability bind ChRE liver pyruvate kinase (LPK) gene. recently reported increase expression multiple liver lipogenic enzyme mRNAs elicited feeding high-carbohydrate diet well LPK mRNA markedly reduced mice lacking ChREBP gene expression (ChREBP(-/-)) comparison WT mice. present study provides evidence direct dominant role ChREBP glucose regulation two key liver lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) fatty acid synthase (FAS). ACC, FAS, LPK mRNA levels higher WT hepatocytes cultured high (25 mM) rather low (5.5 mM) glucose medium, effect glucose concentration mRNA levels ChREBP(-/-) hepatocytes. Similarly, reporter constructs containing ACC, FAS, LPK gene ChREs responsive glucose transfected WT ChREBP(-/-) hepatocytes, glucose transactivation constructs ChREBP(-/-) hepatocytes restored cotransfection ChREBP expression plasmid. ChREBP binding ACC, FAS, LPK ChRE sequences vitro demonstrated electrophoretic mobility super shift assays. vivo binding ChREBP ACC, FAS, LPK gene promoters intact liver nuclei rats fed high-carbohydrate diet demonstrated using formaldehyde crosslinking chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure.
