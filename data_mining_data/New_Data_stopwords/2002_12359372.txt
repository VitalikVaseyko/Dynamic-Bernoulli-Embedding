 study designed investigate value tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (tumor M2-PK) determination early marker response trastuzumab therapy patients metastasized breast cancer. Plasma samples 20 trastuzumab patients collected immediately standard hematological investigations. tumor M2-PK level quantified using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ScheBo Biotech) CA 15-3 measured automatically using Bayer Immuno 1 immunoanalyzer corresponding assay. assay performed duplicate. values analyzed correlation clinical course patient. Median observation time 13 months range 4 22 months. 17/20 (85%) patients, tumor M2-PK determination marker clinical course disease. 'tumor M2-PK sensitive' group, 49 known clinical events (remission progression according UICC criteria) recorded. variation tumor M2-PK level paralleled 63% clinical events (31/49). data suggest tumor M2-PK determination plasma patients metastasized breast cancer could helpful tool monitoring therapeutic success.
