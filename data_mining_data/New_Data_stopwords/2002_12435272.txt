 Liver contains two pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), namely PDK2 PDK4, regulate glucose oxidation inhibitory phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Starvation increases hepatic PDK2 PDK4 protein expression, latter occurring, part, via mechanism involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha). High-fat feeding hyperthyroidism, increase circulating lipid supply, enhance hepatic PDK2 protein expression, increases insufficient account observed increases hepatic PDK activity. Enhanced expression PDK4, PDK2, occurs part via mechanism involving PPAR-alpha. Heterodimerization partners retinoid X receptors (RXRs) include PPARalpha thyroid-hormone receptors (TRs). therefore investigated responses hepatic PDK protein expression high-fat feeding hyperthyroidism relation hepatic lipid delivery disposal. High-fat feeding increased hepatic PDK2, PDK4, protein expression whereas hyperthyroidism increased hepatic PDK2 PDK4 protein expression. manipulations decreased sensitivity hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I) suppression malonyl-CoA, hyperthyrodism elevated plasma fatty acid ketone-body concentrations CPT maximal activity. Administration selective PPAR-alpha activator WY14,643 significantly increased PDK4 protein similar extent control high-fat-fed rats, WY14,643 treatment hyperthyroidism additive effects hepatic PDK4 protein expression. PPARalpha activation influence hepatic PDK2 protein expression euthyroid rats, suggesting up-regulation PDK2 hyperthyroidism involve PPARalpha, attenuated effect hyperthyroidism increase hepatic PDK2 expression. results indicate hepatic PDK4 up-regulation achieved heterodimerization either PPARalpha TR RXR receptor effects PPARalpha activation hepatic PDK2 PDK4 expression favour switch towards preferential expression PDK4.
