 AMP-activated protein kinase multisubstrate protein kinase that, liver, inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, rate-limiting enzyme fatty acid synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol synthesis. AICAR (5-amino 4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide, ZMP) found stimulate 10-fold rat liver AMP-activated protein kinase, half-maximal effect approximately 5 mM. accordance previous observations, addition suspensions isolated rat hepatocytes 50-500 microM AICAriboside, nucleoside corresponding ZMP, resulted accumulation millimolar concentrations latter. accompanied dose-dependent inactivation acetyl-CoA carboxylase 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Addition 50-500 microM AICAriboside hepatocyte suspensions incubated presence various substrates, including glucose lactate/pyruvate, caused parallel inhibition fatty acid cholesterol synthesis. lactate/pyruvate (10/1 mM), half-maximal inhibition obtained approximately 100 microM, near-complete inhibition 500 microM AICAriboside. findings open new perspectives simultaneous control triglyceride cholesterol synthesis pharmacological stimulators AMP-activated protein kinase.
