 level enzyme activity, enzyme thermostability profile, isozyme electrophoretic pattern determined young old erythrocytes newborn infants adults samples adult individuals increased reticulocyte counts. Cord blood samples higher levels enzymatic activity 12 14 enzymes measured, adenylate kinase phosphoglucomutase exceptions. largest differences activity newborns adults glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase pyruvate kinase showed largest differences young old cells. levels activity glutathione reductase, adenylate kinase, phosphoglucomutase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerokinase, glucose phosphate isomerase cord blood samples suggest regulation expression enzymes different fetal erythrocytes erythrocytes adult. Differences thermostability profile enzymes cells different sources and/or different ages noted 5 9 enzymes. unique electrophoretically identifiable fetal isozymes observed, although differences isozyme distribution staining intensity associated cell source and/or cell age noted many 23 enzymes examined. Many differences enzyme characteristics potential confused genetic alterations enzyme structure function.
