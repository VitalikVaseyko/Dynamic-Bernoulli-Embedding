 work carried investigate relative roles phosphofructokinase pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase increased glycolysis climacteric ripening bananas (Musa cavendishii Lamb ex Paxton). Fruit ripened dark continuous stream air absence ethylene. CO2 production, contents glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate PPi; maximum catalytic activities pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase measured 12-day period included climacteric. Cytosolic fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase could detected extracts climacteric fruit. peak CO2 production preceded threefold rise phosphofructokinase, accompanied falls fructose 6-phosphate glucose 6-phosphate, rise fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. change pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase pyrophosphate found. argued phosphofructokinase primarily responsible increased entry fructose 6-phosphate glycolysis climacteric.
