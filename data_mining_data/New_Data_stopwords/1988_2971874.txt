 effect fatigue (running exhaustion) Vmax activity key glycolytic enzymes measured saturating substrate concentrations muscles, liver brain sedentary trained (running treadmill one h/day 20 m/min, five days/week six months) female Zucker fatty rats lean littermates investigated. sedentary rats, fatigue increased activity phosphofructokinase (PFK) red vastus muscle 82% lean, 120% obese rats. trained rats, fatigue increased PFK activity 28% white vastus muscle lean rats. lean animals, hexokinase (HK) activity decreased 26% red vastus sedentary rats, 29% white vastus trained rats upon fatiguing. Pyruvate kinase (PK) activity also decreased 29% white vastus fatigued lean animals. Training effect activity glycolytic enzymes, except PK activity increased 27% cortex lean animals. concluded Zucker rat, glycolytic enzymes may play differential role regulating glycolysis exercise fatigue; extent involvement differs depending upon type tissue studied exercise. view reported short half-life (7-17 h) PFK covalent modification, suggested total content and/or phosphorylation status enzyme may affected animals subjected long-term fatigue.
