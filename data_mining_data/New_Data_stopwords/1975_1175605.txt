 model system consisting highly coupled rat liver mitochondria respiring presence substrate, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, hexokinase glucose, increase mitochondrial concentration results progressive decrease activity pyruvate kinase. results accord role pyruvate kinase determinant glycolytic activity competing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation available ADP. addition adequate amounts amino acids, cysteine, alanine phenylalanine, known inhibitors pyruvate kinase, living Ehrlich ascites tumor cell suspensions results stimulation respiratory rate decrease glycolytic rate cells. Concomitant changes, accumulation intracellular phosphoenolpyruvate ADP, decrease pyruvate ATP. results provide additional evidence paying attention pyruvate kinase another key enzyme whose properties activities may major determinants control glycolysis Crabtree Pasteur effects tumor cells.
