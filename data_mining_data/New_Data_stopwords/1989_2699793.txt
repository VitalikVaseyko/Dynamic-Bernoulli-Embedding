 anaerobically grown yeast cells lack functional mitochondria, presence diethylstilbestrol (DES) depressed glycolysis. addition inhibitor markedly increased cellular concentration glycolytic intermediates formed prior pyruvate kinase step well bring increase [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. conditions 18 fold decrease mass action ratio pyruvate kinase [( pyruvate] [ATP]/[phosphoenolpyruvate] [ADP]) noted, however, little effect glycolytic enzymes. results suggest depression anaerobic glycolysis caused DES results blockage level regulatory enzyme pyruvate kinase modification intracellular environment.
