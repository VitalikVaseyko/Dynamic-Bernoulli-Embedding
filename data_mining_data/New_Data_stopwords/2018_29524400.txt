 Pterostilbene, bioactive component blueberries grapes, shows structural similarity resveratrol, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, hypoglycemic, cholesterol lowering effects. Recent evidence indicates pterostilbene agonist nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). Since PPAR-alpha agonists induce peroxisomal proliferation fatty acid oxidation, examined gene expression acyl CoA oxidase (ACO) carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1). Pterostilbene treatment, concentrations demonstrated 75% cell viability (20muM, 50muM), significantly increased gene expression ACO, CPT-1, PPAR-alpha. Pterostilbene treatment (50muM) also demonstrated potent activation AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), compared AICAR (0.5mM) metformin (2mM), consistent upregulation fatty acid oxidation gene expression. Since AMPK activators mimic actions insulin repressing hepatic gluconeogenesis, examined pterostilbene's effects hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Pterostilbene treatment significantly repressed dexamethasone-induced phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose6-phosphatase (G6Pase) gene expression, decreased glucose production H4IIE cells. Taken together, studies demonstrate pterostilbene, natural compound PPAR-alpha agonist, modulate several AMPK-dependent metabolic functions. results present study suggest pterostilbene may beneficial effects prevention management type 2 diabetes related disorders. study, found pterostilbene activated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) increased expression fatty acid oxidation genes, including acyl CoA oxidase carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1.
