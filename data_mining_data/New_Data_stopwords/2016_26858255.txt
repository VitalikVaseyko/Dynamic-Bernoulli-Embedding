 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) displays high degree metabolic plasticity adapt challenging host environments. Genetic evidence suggests thatMtbrelies mainly fatty acid catabolism host. However,Mtbalso maintains functional glycolytic pathway role cellular metabolism ofMtbhas yet understood. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes last rate-limiting step glycolysis theMtbgenome harbors one putative pyruvate kinase (pykA, Rv1617). show thatpykAencodes active pyruvate kinase allosterically activated glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Deletion ofpykApreventsMtbgrowth presence fermentable carbon sources cidal effect presence glucose correlates elevated levels toxic catabolite methylglyoxal. Growth attenuation also observed media containing combination short chain fatty acids glucose surprisingly, media containing odd even chain fatty acids alone. Untargeted high sensitivity metabolomics revealed inactivation pyruvate kinase leads accumulation phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate), citrate, aconitate, consistent allosteric inhibition isocitrate dehydrogenase P-enolpyruvate. metabolic block could relieved addition alpha-ketoglutarate precursor glutamate. Taken together, study identifies essential role pyruvate kinase preventing metabolic block carbon co-catabolism inMtb.
