 Rigorous control substrate oxidation humoral factors essential maintaining metabolic homeostasis. feeding fasting cycles, carbohydrates fatty acids two primary substrates oxidative metabolism. Here, report novel role peptide hormone adropin regulating substrate oxidation preferences. Plasma levels adropin increase feeding decrease upon fasting. comparison whole-body substrate preference skeletal muscle substrate oxidation adropin knockout transgenic mice suggests adropin promotes carbohydrate oxidation fat oxidation. muscle, adropin activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), rate limiting glucose oxidation suppresses carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1B (CPT-1B), key enzyme fatty acid oxidation. Adropin downregulates PDH kinase-4 (PDK4) inhibits PDH, thereby increasing PDH activity. molecular mechanisms adropin's effects involve acetylation (suggesting inhibition) transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha, downregulating expression Cpt1b Pdk4. Increased PGC-1alpha acetylation adropin may mediated inhibiting Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), PGC-1alpha deacetylase. Altered SIRT1 PGC-1alpha activity appear mediate aspects adropin's metabolic actions muscle. Similar outcomes observed fasted mice treated synthetic adropin. Together, results suggest role adropin regulating muscle substrate preference various nutritional states.
