 Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases catalytically diverse family nonheme iron enzymes oxidize primary substrates decomposing 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate form succinate CO(2). report generic assay enzymes uses succinyl-coenzyme synthetase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase couple formation product succinate conversion reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. demonstrate utility new method measuring kinetic parameters two bacterial Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Significantly, method used investigate productive turnover reactions nonproductive "uncoupled" decarboxylation reactions enzyme family, demonstrated using wild-type variant forms 2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase. assay amenable miniaturization easily adapted format suitable high-throughput screening; thus, valuable tool study Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.
