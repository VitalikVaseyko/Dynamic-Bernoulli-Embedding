 elevated rate glucose consumption dependency aerobic glycolysis ATP generation long observed cancer cells, phenomenon known Warburg effect. altered energy metabolism cancer cells provides attractive opportunity developing novel cancer therapeutic strategies. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), catalyzes transformation pyruvate lactate, plays vital role process glycolysis. reported level LDH-A expression increased head neck cancer cells blood serum nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients, associated poor prognosis. However, effect LDH-A inhibition NPC cells remains unknown. Here, present study, found oxamate, classical inhibitor LDH-A, suppressed cell proliferation dose- time-dependent manner CNE-1 CNE-2 cells, two NPC cancer cell lines. LDH inhibition oxamate induced G2/M cell cycle arrest via downregulation CDK1/cyclin B1 pathway promoted apoptosis enhancement mitochondrial ROS generation. N-acetylcysteine, specific scavenger ROS, significantly blocked growth inhibition effect induced oxamate. also identified oxamate increased sensitivity ionizing radiation two NPC cancer cell lines. Furthermore, verified similar results tumor xenograft models. collectively, results suggest LDH-A may serve promising therapeutic target NPC treatment.
