 Severe hemorrhage leads decreased blood flow tissues resulting decreased oxygen nutrient availability affecting mitochondrial function. mitoscriptome profiling study demonstrated alteration several genes related mitochondria, consistent mitochondrial functional decline observed trauma hemorrhage (T-H). experiments led identification sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) potential target T-H. Administration resveratrol (a naturally occurring polyphenol activator SIRT1) T-H improved left ventricular function tissue ATP levels. hypothesis mitochondrial function T-H depends SIRT1 activity. study, evaluated activity SIRT1, mitochondrial functional modulator, mitochondrial-glycolytic balance T-H. determined changes protein levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-1 nuclear c-Myc, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha NF-E2-related factor (NRF)2 T-H treatment resveratrol combination sirtinol (a SIRT1 inhibitor) resveratrol. also tested activity mitochondrial complex 1. SIRT1 enzyme activity significantly decreased T-H, whereas resveratrol treatment restored activity. found elevated PDK1 c-Myc levels decreased PGC-1alpha, NRF2 mitochondrial complex activity T-H. reduced SIRT1 activity T-H may related declining mitochondrial function, since resveratrol able reinstate SIRT1 activity mitochondrial function. elevated level PDK1 (an inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) T-H indicates possible shift cellular energetics mitochondria glycolysis. conclusion, SIRT1 modulation alters left ventricular function T-H regulation cellular energetics.
