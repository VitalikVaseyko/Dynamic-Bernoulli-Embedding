 study investigated protective effect vincristine (VCR) isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac necrosis (CN) rats. Animals (n=7 group) pretreated vincristine (25microg/kg) intraperitoneal (i.p.) daily 5-day cycles 2 days pause cycles using 5-day-on, 2-day-off schedule two weeks intoxicated isoproterenol (100mg/kg, s.c., 2 consecutive days). ISO-induced myocardial damage indicated changes electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns, increased activities marker enzymes creatine kinase-MB, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase lactate dehydrogenase levels troponin-T serum. levels lipid peroxide products, (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) lipid hydroperoxides (HP)) increased parallel decrease activities antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase reduced glutathione) ISO-induced rats. Furthermore, ISO-induced rats showed increase activities membrane bound enzymes Ca(2+)-ATPase Mg(2+)-ATPase decreased activity Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining heart section showed increased area necrosis ISO-induced rats. Pretreatment VCR (25microg/kg) eliminated ISO-induced biochemical histopathological changes, decreased myocardial necrosis greater extent. Transmission electron microscopic findings structure heart mitochondria confirmed protective effects VCR. Present study provides first scientific report protective effect vincristine ISO-induced cardiac damage rats.
