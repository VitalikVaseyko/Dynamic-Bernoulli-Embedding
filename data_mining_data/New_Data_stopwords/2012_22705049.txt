 report effect immunomodulatory anti-mycobacterial naphthoquinone, lapachol, bi-dimensional patterns protein expression toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-agonised IFN-gamma-treated THP-1 macrophages. non-hypothesis driven proteomic analysis intends shed light cellular functions lapachol may affecting. Proteins cytosol membrane fractions analysed. quantification protein spots, protein levels corresponding macrophages activated absence presence lapachol compared. number proteins identified, levels appreciably significantly increased decreased result action lapachol activated macrophages: cofilin-1, fascin, plastin-2, glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase, adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1, pyruvate kinase, sentrin-specific protease 6, cathepsin B, cathepsin D, cytosolic aminopeptidase, proteasome beta type-4 protease, tryptophan-tRNA ligase, DnaJ homolog protein disulphide isomerase. Altogether, comparative analysis performed indicates lapachol could hypothetically causing impairment cell migration and/or phagocytic capacity, increase NADPH availability, decrease pyruvate concentration, protection proteosomal protein degradation, decrease lysosomal protein degradation, impairment cytosolic peptide generation, interference NOS2 activation grp78 function. present proteomic results suggest issues experimentally addressed ex- in-vivo, establish accurately potential lapachol anti-infective drug. study also constitutes model pre-in-vivo evaluation drug actions.
