 Prominent features cancer cells include metabolic imbalances enhanced resistance mitochondrial apoptosis. fact tumors rely heavily glycolysis meet metabolic demands recognized since beginning twentieth century, yet complete elucidation so-called Warburg effect achieved. Several mechanisms proposed explain phenomenon, including upregulation rate-limiting steps glycolysis, accumulation mutations mitochondrial genome, hypoxia-induced switch mitochondrial respiration glycolysis metabolic reprogramming resulting loss-of-function enzymes like fumarate succinate dehydrogenases. aerobic glycolysis apoptosis resistance linked remains elucidated. one hand, alterations may acquired independently cancer cells multistep oncogenesis. hand, suppression intrinsic apoptotic program may achieved mechanisms directly lead Warburg phenotype. Cancer-specific mitochondrial alterations bioenergetics may taken advantage development two novel classes antineoplastic agents. first approach would target glycolysis and/or revert Warburg phenomenon, whereas second approach would aim inducing apoptosis targeting mitochondrial proteins membranes. instances, encouraging pre-clinical results obtained.
