 Erythrocytes individuals pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency approximately half total (oxidized reduced) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) normal erythrocytes. order elucidate mechanism(s) decrease total NAD, examined NAD synthesis intact erythrocytes. demonstrated NAD synthesis impaired PK-deficient erythrocytes degree dependent PK activity adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) concentration cells. incubation presence fluoride, simulates characteristics PK deficiency inhibiting enolase, normal erythrocytes impaired NAD synthesis decreased ATP concentrations. Fluoride inhibit NAD synthesis hemolysate system dependent glycolysis ATP generation. data suggest fluoride inhibit enzymes NAD synthesis impairment NAD synthesis fluoride mediated decreased ATP formation. Thus, concluded impaired NAD synthesis PK-deficient erythrocytes caused decreased ATP formation due PK deficiency. Since rate glycolysis limited availability NAD+, suggested impaired NAD synthesis causes ATP depletion thereby may enhance hemolysis PK-deficient erythrocytes.
