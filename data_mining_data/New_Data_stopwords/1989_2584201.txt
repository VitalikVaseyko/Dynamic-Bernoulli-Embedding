 gene L-type pyruvate kinase possesses two promoters located 500 base pairs apart. L promoter specific liver regulated hormones diet; L' promoter specific erythroid cells. produced two series transgenic mice carrying either entire rat L-pyruvate kinase gene minigene devoid exons two nine, 2.7 kilobases flanking sequences 5' cap site L' promoter 1.4 kilobases 3' downstream polyadenylation site. series patterns expression two promoters similar endogenous rat gene. rat L promoter expressed strongly liver weakly kidney gut adult transgenic mice. Moreover, regulated like endogenous rat L-pyruvate kinase gene upon hormonal nutritional adaptation: level L-pyruvate kinase mRNA decreased dramatically 24 h starvation, refeeding carbohydrate-rich diet strongly stimulated expression transgenes. stimulation prevented glucagon. Use alternative polyadenylation sites last exon rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene similar types transgenes similar rat control mice, suggesting transgenes contain sequences control choice polyadenylation site. Transcription minigene higher entire transgene, probably due high copy number minigene. protein level, rat L subunits encoded entire transgene abundant mouse subunits liver adult transgenic mice. contrast, expression rat L' promoter fetal liver 5% fetal rat liver, unable detect rat L' subunits pyruvate kinase enzyme red blood cells transgenic mice. results suggest integrated DNA contains elements necessary tissue specificity (L' L) well hormonal nutritional control (L) expression rat transgene. Nevertheless, L'-specific activating element may missing.
