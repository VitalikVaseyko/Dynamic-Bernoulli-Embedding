 Starvation experimental diabetes induce stable increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activity skeletal muscle, largely due selective upregulation PDK-4 expression. Increased free fatty acid (FFA) level suggested responsible upregulation. metabolic states also characterized insulin deficiency, present study designed examine whether insulin significant effect regulate PDK mRNA expression rat skeletal muscle. study 1, overnight-fasted rats received infusion saline insulin 5 h (n = 6 each). insulin infusion, plasma glucose clamped basal levels (euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp). third group (n = 6) received Intralipid infusion clamp prevent fall plasma FFA. PDK-2 mRNA level gastrocnemius muscle altered insulin FFA (i.e., Intralipid infusion). contrast, PDK-4 mRNA level decreased 72% insulin (P < 0.05), Intralipid infusion prevented 20% decrease. PDK-4 protein level decreased approximately 20% insulin (P < 0.05), effect altered Intralipid infusion. study 2, overnight-fasted rats refed received infusion saline nicotinic acid (NA, 30 micromol/h) 5 h (n = 5 each). refeeding NA infusion, plasma FFA levels similarly (i.e., 60-70% vs. saline control) lowered. Muscle PDK-4 mRNA level decreased 77% refeeding (P < 0.05) NA infusion. conclusion, present data indicate insulin profound effect suppress PDK-4 expression skeletal muscle that, contrary previous suggestions, circulating FFA little impact PDK-4 mRNA expression, least within 5 h.
