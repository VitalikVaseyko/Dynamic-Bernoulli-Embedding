 Microbial systems known elaborate intricate metabolic strategies effort fend toxic impact numerous metals. study, show exposure Pseudomonas fluorescens aluminum (Al) resulted metabolic shift aimed diverting oxaloacetate towards biogenesis aluminophore. metabolic alteration characterized uncoupling two gluconeogenic enzymes, namely pyruvate carboxylase (PC) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). PC displayed sharp increase activity expression, PEPCK severely diminished. Malic enzyme (ME) NAD kinase (NADK), two enzymes involved maintaining reductive environment, markedly increased Al-stressed cells. Hence, Al-exposed Pseudomonas fluorescens evoked metabolic response aimed generating oxaloacetate promoting intracellular reductive environment.
