 OBJECTIVES: determine erythrocyte pyruvate kinase activity (ePKA) time diagnosis patients acute leukemia lymphoma differences ePKA profiles malignant disease chemotherapy. METHODS: prospective, longitudinal clinical study performed involving 57 patients, 10 ones relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 32 ones acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 15 ones lymphoma. None subjects study group received treatment blood transfusion study, except ones diagnosed relapse ALL. Forty two healthy children also selected form control group. order measure ePKA, blood samples taken five times, 1.5 months apart study. Statistical analysis done using Wilcoxon's signed rank test, Kruskall-Wallis Mann-Whitney U Test Spearman rank correlation coefficient test. RESULTS: ePKA patients relapse ALL, ALL, patients lymphoma, time diagnosis found lower compared one's control group (respectively p = 0.001, p = 0.003). comparison first ePKA samples third ePKA samples patients lymphoma showed significant increase (respectively p = 0.006, p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: measurement ePKA considered follow-up neoplastic treatment due fact detected low leukemia relapse normal values chemotherapy. However, long-term studies, including number cases, required carried order prove accuracy hypothesis. (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 28.)
