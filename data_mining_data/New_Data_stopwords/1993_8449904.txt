 Mammal pyruvate kinases encoded two genes. L gene produces erythroid (R-PK) hepatic (L-PK) isozymes alternative use two promoters. report characterization cis- trans-acting elements involved tissue-specific activity L gene erythroid promoter. R-PK DNA fragment extending -870 +54 relative cap site confers erythroid specificity reporter gene. Within region, define minimal promoter (-62 +54) displays erythroid-specific activity contains two DNA binding sites. One, located -50, binds members CCACC/Sp1 family other, located -20, binds erythroid factor GATA-1. Although -20 GATA binding site (AGATAA) also potential TFIID binding site, bind TFIID. Furthermore, substitution GATA binding site canonical TFIID binding site suppresses promoter activity. Mutations deletions sites indicate association CCACC/Sp1 GATA binding sites drive efficient tissue-specific expression R-PK minimal promoter. Finally, co-transfection experiments, study elements involved hGATA-1 transactivation R-PK promoter HeLa cells.
