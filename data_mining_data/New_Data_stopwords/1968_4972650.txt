 1. Extraction rat epididymal adipose tissue buffer containing EDTA yields pyruvate kinase, provisionally called PyK-A, properties resemble several respects allosteric pyruvate kinase liver. properties include co-operative interactions phosphoenolpyruvate, Mg(2+), K(+), NH(4) (+) ATP, sensitivity activation fructose 1,6-diphosphate. 2. Extraction absence EDTA yields predominantly form, PyK-B, shows normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate, Mg(2+) ATP, co-operative interactions K(+) NH(4) (+); form insensitive towards fructose 1,6-diphosphate. 3. forms yield simple kinetics ADP, though K(m) values differ two systems. cases co-operativity demonstrated, Hill-plot n values 1.4 2.0. 4. conversion PyK-A PyK-B mediated specifically fructose 1,6-diphosphate; reverse reaction occasioned EDTA, ATP citrate. thought bivalent cation may involved interconversion. 5. Attempts partial purification revealed enzyme resembles pyruvate kinase skeletal muscle, rather liver, solubility ammonium sulphate elution DEAE-cellulose. 6. relevance properties regulation pyruvate kinase activity vivo adipose tissue discussed.
