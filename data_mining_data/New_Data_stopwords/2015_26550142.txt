 OBJECTIVES: study aimed systematically analyze changes mitochondrial-related protein expression bladder cancer cells tumor-associated fibroblasts investigate characteristics bladder cancer cell energy metabolism. METHODS: study, utilized following techniques achieve objectives: (1) co-culture system bladder tumor cells fibroblasts built using microfluidic chip three-dimensional culture system; (2) concentration lactic acid medium different groups determined using automatic micro-plate reader; (3) qualitative analysis mitochondria-related protein expression performed immunofluorescent staining; (4) quantitative analysis mitochondrial-associated protein expression conducted via Western blot. SPSS software utilized analyze data. RESULTS: (1) Determination lactic acid concentration: lactic acid concentration determined highest experimental group, followed T24 cell control group fibroblast control group. (2) Qualitative results: control group, mitochondrial-related protein fluorescence intensity higher fibroblasts compared cancer cells, fluorescence intensity fibroblasts reduced compared experimental group. mitochondrial-related protein fluorescence intensity cancer cells higher experimental group compared control group, opposite results obtained fibroblasts. (3) Quantitative results: expression mitochondria-related proteins higher fibroblasts compared cancer cells control group, opposite results obtained experimental group (P<0.05). expression mitochondria-related proteins increased cancer cells experimental group compared control group; opposite results observed fibroblasts (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: energy metabolism bladder tumor cells parallel "Warburg effect" even sufficient oxygen conditions, cancer cells still undergo glycolysis. Bladder cancer cells also efficient oxidative phosphorylation process wherein cancer cells promote glycolysis adjacent interstitial cells, thereby causing increased formation nutritional precursors. high-energy metabolites transferred adjacent tumor cells specified direction enter Krebs Cycle. Ultimately, oxidative phosphorylation increases, sufficient ATP produced.
