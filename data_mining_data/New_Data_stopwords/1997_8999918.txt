 "Spot 14" protein appears rapidly nuclei hepatocytes exposed glucose thyroid hormone. Exposure glucose- T3-treated hepatocytes spot 14 antisense oligonucleotide inhibited induction mRNAs encoding malic enzyme, ATP citrate-lyase, fatty acid synthase, liver-type pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, type deiodinase hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, cytochrome c, actin mRNAs. Induction spot 14, ATP citrate-lyase, fatty acid synthase polypeptides, propionyl-CoA carboxylase mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase, inhibited. Antisense treatment hepatocytes transfected reporter controlled glucose- T3-inducible fragment pyruvate kinase gene promoter inhibited reporter activity, cotransfection reporter spot 14 antisense plasmid. Spot 14 protein acts induction mRNAs coding key lipogenic (malic enzyme, ATP citrate-lyase, fatty acid synthase), glycolytic (pyruvate kinase), gluconeogenic enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), well diet-responsive type deiodinase, involved mitochondrial respiration (cytochrome c) cholesterol synthesis (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase). Transfection experiments indicated effects mediated transcriptional level. protein functions activation genes involved metabolic switching fasted fed states liver.
