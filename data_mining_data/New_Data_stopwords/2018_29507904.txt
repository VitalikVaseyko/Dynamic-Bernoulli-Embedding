 Primary hepatocyte culture important vitro system study liver functions. vivo, hepatocytes high oxidative metabolism. However, oxygen supply means diffusion vitro static cultures much less blood circulation vivo. Therefore, investigated whether hypoxia contributes dedifferentiation deregulated metabolism cultured hepatocytes. end, murine hepatocytes cultured static shaken (60 revolutions per minute) conditions collagen sandwich. effect hypoxia hepatocyte cultures examined metabolites media cells, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1/2alpha western blotting, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction HIF target genes key genes glucose lipid metabolism. Hepatocytes shaken cultures showed lower glycolytic activity triglyceride accumulation static cultures, compatible improved oxygen delivery mitochondrial energy metabolism. Consistently, static cultures displayed significant HIF-2alpha expression, undetectable freshly isolated hepatocytes shaken cultures. Transcript levels HIF target genes (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [Gapdh], glucose transporter 1 [Glut1], pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 [Pdk1], lactate dehydrogenase [Ldha]) key genes lipid metabolism, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1), apolipoprotein B (Apob), acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase 1 (Acc1), significantly lower shaken compared static cultures. Moreover, expression hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (Hnf4alpha) farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) better preserved shaken cultures result improved oxygen delivery. revealed HIF-2 signaling involved hypoxia-induced down-regulation Fxr. Conclusion: Primary murine hepatocytes static culture suffer hypoxia. Improving oxygenation simple shaking prevents major changes expression metabolic enzymes aberrant triglyceride accumulation; addition, better maintains differentiation state cells. shaken culture is, therefore, advisable strategy use primary hepatocytes vitro model.
