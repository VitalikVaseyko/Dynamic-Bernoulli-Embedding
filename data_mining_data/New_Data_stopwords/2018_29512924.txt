 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) regulates final step glycolysis levels correlated sensitivity anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs. THP one major drugs used non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer instillation chemotherapy. However, low response ratio THP (19.7%) treatment human genitourinary tumours using collagen gel matrix observed. study aims investigate effect down-regulation PKM2 THP efficiency. Via inhibitor siRNA, effects reduced PKM2 efficiency THP determined 2 human 1 murine bladder cancer cell lines, using MTT, cologenic fluorescence approaches. Molecular mechanisms PKM2 THP sensitization explored probing p-AMPK p-STAT3 levels via WB. Syngeneic orthotopic bladder tumour model applied evaluate efficiency vivo, analysed Kaplan-Meier survival curves, body bladder weights plus immunohistochemistric tumour biomarkers. PKM2 overexpressed bladder cancer cells tissues, down-regulation PKM2 enhanced sensitivity THP vitro. Activation AMPK essential THP exert anti-bladder cancer activities. hand, down-regulating PKM2 activates AMPK inhibits STAT3, correlated THP sensitivity. Compared THP alone (400 mumol L(-1) , 50 muL), combination metformin (60 mmol L(-1) , 50 muL) stopped growth bladder cancer completely vivo (combination group VS normal group P = .078). Down-regulating expression PKM2 enhances anticancer efficiency THP. study provides new insight improving chemotherapeutic effect THP.
