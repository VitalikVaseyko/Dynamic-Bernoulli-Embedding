 Pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40) partially purified plant cytosolic fraction N2-fixing soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) root nodules. partially purified PK preparation completely free contamination phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC, EC 4.1.1.31), major phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-utilizing enzyme legume root nodules. Latency experiments sonicated nodule extracts showed Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroids express either PK PEPC activity symbiosis. contrast, free-living B. japonicum bacteria expressed PK activity, PEPC activity. Antibodies specific cytosolic isoform PK castor bean endosperm cross-reacted 52-kDa polypeptide partially purified PK preparation. optimal assay pH (pH 8.0 PEPC pH 6.9 PK) absence malate, PEPC activity crude nodule extracts 2.6 times corresponding PK activity. would tend favour PEP metabolism PEPC PEP metabolism PK. However, pH 7.0 presence 5 mM malate, PEPC activity strongly inhibited, PK activity unaffected. Thus, propose PK PEPC activity legume root nodules may coordinately regulated fluctuations malate concentration plant cytosolic fraction bacteroid-containing cells. Reduced uptake malate bacteroids, result reduced rates N2 fixation, may favour PEP metabolism PK PEP metabolism PEPC.
