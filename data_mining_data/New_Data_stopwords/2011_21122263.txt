 OBJECTIVES: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) difficult diagnose early stage due lack simple specific diagnostic indicators. study performed screen candidate AS-associated proteins peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) patients combining two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technique mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. METHODS: Twelve subjects consisting 6 patients 6 healthy volunteers (HVs) enrolled 2-DE experiments. protein expression patterns PBMCs different groups analysed PDQuest software, protein spots over/under-expressed 2-fold two groups identified MS analysis. Western blot analyses used verify differentially expressed proteins 32 patients 32 HVs. RESULTS: Six proteins including pyruvate kinase (PK), profilin 1 (PFN1), talin 1 (TLN1), Chain cyclophilin (CyPA), unknown protein (gi|16306948) integrin-linked kinase (ILK) identified 10 over-expressed protein spots found 2-DE group. Western blot experiments confirmed higher expression TLN1 ILK group compared HV group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: TLN1 ILK expressed higher PBMCs patients compared healthy controls, involved integrin signalling pathway. two proteins likely novel disease-associated proteins potential disease markers AS.
