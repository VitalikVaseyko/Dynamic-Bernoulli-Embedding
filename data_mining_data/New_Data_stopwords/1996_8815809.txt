 vertebrates utilize supplemental lactate production support energetic demands vigorous, brief exercise. Despite similar patterns accumulation, appears trichotomy regards lactate processing post-exercise. fish retain lactate intramuscularly, using situ glycogen replenishment. Recent evaluation fish muscle concludes pyruvate kinase reversal probable gluconeogenic pathway. Amphibians reptiles also utilize lactate muscle glyconeogenic substrate, lactate sequestered post-exercise. None groups utilize hepatic gluconeogenesis significant extent post-exercise, muscle glucose uptake limited. Lactate oxidation plays major role post-exercise mammals, hepatic muscular gluco- glyconeogenesis contributing lesser extent. Glucocorticoids may regulate lactate release fish muscle, although catecholamines may influence glyconeogenesis reptile muscle. Insulin affects lactate metabolism indirectly effects muscle glucose metabolism.
