 Cells aerotolerant anaerobe Giardia lamblia respire presence oxygen. Endogenous respiration stimulated glucose carbohydrates Krebs cycle intermediates. Endogenous glucose-stimulated respiration insensitive cyanide, malonate, 2,4-dinitrophenol, inhibited atabrin iodoacetamide. G. lamblia produces ethanol, acetate CO2 aerobically anaerobically either endogenous reserves exogenous glucose. Molecular hydrogen produced. following enzyme activities detected homogenates: hexokinase, fructose-biphosphate aldolase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), pyruvate synthase, acetyl-CoA synthetase, alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+), NADH dehydrogenase, NADPH dehydrogenase, NADPH oxidoreductase superoxide dismutase. enzymes energy carbohydrate metabolism nonsedimentable (109 000 x g 30 min). Activities lactate dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, phosphate acetyltransferase, acetate kinase, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase catalase limits detection. results suggest occurrence glycolysis, energy production substrate level phosphorylation flavin, iron-sulfur protein mediated electron transport system well absence cytochrome mediated oxidative phosphorylation functional Krebs cycle.
