 PURPOSE REVIEW: Insight metabolic changes cancer become important cancer regarded disease entity full metabolic implications. summarize recent findings pertaining cancer cell-derived metabolic changes regulate function macrophages favor cancer cell survival, reported approaches reverse changes. RECENT FINDINGS: Since observation dramatic revitalization Warburg effect, metabolic changes thought confined cancer cells. However, Warburg effect recently proven exist various types immune cells tumor tissue. growing number publications indicate cancer cells interact cells tumor microenvironment, traditional inflammatory mediators, also oncometabolites, metabolic changes immune cells oncometabolites key factors favoring survival cancer cells pro-tumoral function immune cells. Notably, metabolic changes occur uniformly tumor progression. SUMMARY: Understanding complex metabolic interactions tumor microenvironment set new paradigm tumor progression, also provide new breakthroughs control cancer modulation function tumor-associated macrophages.
