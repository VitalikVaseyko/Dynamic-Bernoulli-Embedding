 present study investigates whether heavy water affects efficiency 3HOH production D-[1-3H]glucose, D-[2-3H]glucose, D-[5-3H]glucose D-[6-3H]glucose relative total generation tritiated metabolites produced either rat human erythrocytes. relative 3HOH yield close 95% D-[5-3H]glucose, 72% D-[2-3H]glucose, 22-32% D-[1-3H]glucose, 12% D-[6-3H]glucose. latter case, comparison specific radioactivity intracellular extracellular acidic metabolites, expressed relative 14C-labelled metabolites produced D-[U-14C]glucose, indicated generation 3HOH D-[6-3H]glucose occurs distal metabolic steps, partial reversion pyruvate kinase reaction interconversion pyruvate L-alanine reaction catalysed glutamate-pyruvate transaminase. rule, substitution H2O D2O caused minor negligible changes relative 3HOH yield. implies unexpectedly high deuteration 13C-labelled D-glucose metabolites recently documented erythrocytes exposed D2O cannot attributed major interference heavy water factors regulating deuteration detritiation efficiency, enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling specific glycolytic intermediates.
