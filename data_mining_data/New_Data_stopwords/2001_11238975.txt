 elucidate regulatory mechanism propionate production Selenomonas ruminantium, molecular properties gene expression phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck) pyruvate kinase (Pyk) investigated. Pck deduced consist 538 aa molecular mass 59.6 kDa, appeared exist monomer. Pyk revealed consist four identical subunits consisting 469 aa molecular mass 51.3 kDa. Mg(2+) Mn(2+) required maximal activity Pck, Pck utilized ADP, GDP IDP, substrate. Either Mg(2+) Mn(2+) required Pyk activity, enzyme activated phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Pyk activity severely inhibited P(i), restored addition FBP. K:(m) value Pck PEP (0.55 mM) nearly equal K:(m) value Pyk PEP, suggesting partition flow PEP fermentation pathways determined activity ratio Pck Pyk. pck pyk genes monocistronic, although two transcriptional start sites found pyk. level pyk mRNA different whether glucose lactate energy substrate. However, pck mRNA level 12-fold higher grown lactate glucose. level pck mRNA inversely related sufficiency energy, suggesting Pck synthesis regulated transcriptional level energy supply altered. conceivable transcription pck S. ruminantium triggered PEP suppressed ATP.
