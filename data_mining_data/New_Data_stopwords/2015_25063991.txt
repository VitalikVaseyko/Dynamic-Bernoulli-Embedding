 AIMS: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) reported promote tolerance acute myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). However, mechanism HIF-1 stabilization actually confers cardioprotection clear. investigated whether HIF-1alpha stabilization protects heart acute IRI preventing opening mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) potential mechanisms involved. METHODS RESULTS: Stabilization myocardial HIF-1 achieved pharmacological inhibition prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) domain-containing enzyme using GSK360A using cardiac-specific ablation von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL(fl/fl)) mice. Treatment HL-1 cardiac cells GSK360A stabilized HIF-1, increased expression HIF-1 target genes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) hexokinase II (HKII), reprogrammed cell metabolism aerobic glycolysis, thereby resulting production less mitochondrial oxidative stress IRI, less MPTP opening, effects shown dependent HKII. findings confirmed HIF-1 stabilization rat murine heart resulted smaller myocardial infarct sizes (both vivo ex vivo), decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress, inhibited MPTP opening following IRI, effects also found dependent HKII. CONCLUSIONS: demonstrated acute HIF-1alpha stabilization using either pharmacological genetic approach protected heart acute IRI promoting aerobic glycolysis, decreasing mitochondrial oxidative stress, activating HKII, inhibiting MPTP opening.
