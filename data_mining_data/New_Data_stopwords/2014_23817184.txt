 BACKGROUND/AIMS: earlier studies suggested crosstalk IRS/PI3 kinase/PDK1/Akt/Rac1/ROCK (Shc2/Grb2/SOS)/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways downstream PDGF-betabeta receptor responsible chemotaxis proliferation malignant mesothelioma cells. present study conducted obtain evidence this. METHODS: assess activation Akt, MEK, ERK, Western blotting carried MSTO-211H malignant mesothelioma cells using antibodies phospho-Thr308-Akt, phopho-Ser473-Akt, Akt, phospho-MEK, MEK, phopho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2. knock-down Akt, PI3 kinase, PDK1, Rac1, siRNAs silencing each-targeted gene constructed transfected cells. monitor Rac1 activity, FRET monitoring carried living fixed cells. RESULTS: ERK activated basal conditions MSTO-211H cells, activation prevented inhibitors PI3 kinase, PDK1, Akt, Rac1 knocking-down PI3 kinase, PDK1, Akt, Rac1. Akt also activated basal conditions, activation suppressed MEK inhibitor ERK1/2 inhibitor. FRET analysis, Rac1 activated basal conditions, activation inhibited MEK inhibitor ERK1/2 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: results present study show ERK could activated PI3 kinase, PDK1, Akt, Rac1 alternatively, Akt Rac1 could activated MEK ERK MSTO-211H cells.
