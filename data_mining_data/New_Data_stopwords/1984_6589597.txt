 Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) phosphatase purified 8000-fold extracts bovine kidney mitochondria. highly purified phosphatase exhibited molecular weight approximately 460,000, estimated gel-permeation chromatography. Another form phosphatase, apparent molecular weight approximately 230,000, also detected conditions high dilution. contrast pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, BCKDH phosphatase active absence divalent cations. BCKDH phosphatase inactive toward 32P-labeled phosphorylase a, exhibited approximately 10% maximal activity 32P-labeled pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. BCKDH phosphatase activity inhibited GTP, GDP, ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP, CTP, CDP. Half-maximal inhibition occurred 60, 200, 200, 400, 100, 250, 250, 400 microM, respectively. inhibitions reversed completely 2 mM Mg2+. GTP replaceable guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate. GMP, AMP, UMP, CMP, NAD, NADH showed little effect, any, BCKDH phosphatase activity concentrations 1 mM. Heparin showed half-maximal inhibition 2 micrograms/ml. inhibition partially (30%) reversed 2 mM Mg2+. CoA various acyl-CoA compounds exhibited half-maximal inhibition 150-300 microM. inhibitions reversed 2 mM Mg2+. BCKDH phosphatase activity stimulated 1.5- 3-fold protamine, poly(L-lysine), poly(L-arginine) 3.6 micrograms/ml.
