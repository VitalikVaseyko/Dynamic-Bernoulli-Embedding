 novel class inhibitors branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (BCOAD) complex synthesized studied. sodium salts arylidenepyruvates: e.g., furfurylidenepyruvate (compound I), 4-(3-thienyl)-2-oxo-3-butenoate (compound II), cinnamalpyruvate (compound III) 4-(2-thienyl)-2-oxo-3-butenoate (compound IV) inhibit overall kinase reactions BCOAD complex bovine liver. Inhibitions overall reaction occur decarboxylase (E1) step determined spectrophotometric assay 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol electron acceptor. Inhibition E1 reaction compound (Ki = 0.5 microM) competitive, whereas inhibitions compounds II (Ki = 150 microM) III (Ki = 500 microM) non-competitive respect substrate 2-oxoisovalerate. Km value 2-oxoisovalerate 6.7 microM measured E1 assay. Inhibition E1 step compounds I, II III reversible low inhibitor concentrations based Michaelis-Menten kinetics observed. comparison, compound significantly inhibit pyruvate 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. arylidenepyruvates (compounds I, II IV) inhibit BCOAD kinase reaction manner similar substrate 2-oxo acids. inhibition kinase reaction compound non-competitive respect ATP, apparent Ki value 4.5 mM. results suggest arylidenepyruvates may useful probes elucidating reaction mechanisms BCOAD complex kinase.
