 Dichloroacetate (DCA) metabolic reprogramming agent reverses Warburg effect, causing cancer cells couple glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation. shown induce apoptosis reduce growth various types cancer normal cells. Colorectal cancer cells HCT116, HCT116 p53(-/-), HCT116 Bax(-/-), treated DCA vitro. Response treatment determined measuring PDH phosphorylation, apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycle. Molecular changes associated responses determined using western immunoblotting quantitative PCR. Treatment 20 mM DCA increase apoptosis, despite decreasing levels anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 6 h, cell lines observed. Mcl-1 expression stabilized MG-132, inhibitor proteasomal degradation. decrease Mcl-1 correlated decrease proliferation, showed dose-dependence DCA treated cells. Cells showed nuclear localization Mcl-1, however cell cycle unaffected DCA treatment. data suggest reduction prosurvival Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 due increased proteasomal degradation correlated ability DCA reduce proliferation HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells without causing apoptosis.
