 86 benign malignant tumours investigated histologically immunohistologically. Staining intensity measured scanning-photometry. computed optical density digitalized evaluated image analysis system. results indicate significantly higher amount M2-PK malignant tumours. adenocarcinomas mammary gland, content M2-PK increased parallel malignancy (p less 0.01; r = 0.743). M2-PK serve indicator grade malignancy mammary tumours rat.
