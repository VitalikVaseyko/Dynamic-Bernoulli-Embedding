 metabolic behavior cancer cells adapted meet proliferative needs, notable changes enhanced lactate secretion glucose uptake rates. work, use Ensemble Modeling (EM) framework gain insight predict potential drug targets tumor cells. EM generates set models span space kinetic parameters constrained thermodynamics. Perturbation data based known targets used screen entire ensemble models obtain sub-set, increasingly predictive. EM allows incorporation regulatory information captures behavior enzymatic reactions molecular level representing reactions elementary reaction form. study, metabolic network consisting 58 reactions considered accounts glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, includes allosteric regulation key enzymes. Experimentally measured intracellular extracellular metabolite concentrations used developing ensemble models along information established drug targets. resulting models predicted transaldolase (TALA) succinyl-CoA ligase (SUCOAS1m) cause significant reduction growth rate repressed, relative currently known drug targets. Furthermore, results suggest synergistic repression transaldolase glycine hydroxymethyltransferase (GHMT2r) lead threefold decrease growth rate compared repression single enzyme targets.
