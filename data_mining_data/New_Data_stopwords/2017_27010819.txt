 report, preparation characterization bioconjugates, wherein enzymes pyruvate kinase (Pk) l-lactic dehydrogenase (Ldh) covalently bound poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-poly(ethylenimine) (PNIPAm-PEI) microgel support using glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linker. effects different arrangements enzymes microgels investigated enzymatic behavior obtain maximum Pk-Ldh sequential reaction. dual enzyme bioconjugates prepared simultaneous addition enzymes immobilized microgel particles (PL), PiLi, is, dual enzyme bioconjugate obtained combining single-enzyme bioconjugates (immobilized pyruvate kinase (Pi) immobilized lactate dehydrogenase (Li)), used study effect assembly dual enzymes systems microgels. kinetic parameters (Km, kcat), reaction parameters (temperature, pH), stability (thermal storage), cofactor dependent applications studied dual enzymes conjugates. kinetic results indicated improved turn number (kcat) PL, kcat catalytic efficiency significantly decreased case PiLi. cofactor dependent application, ability ADP monitoring ATP synthesis conjugates studied, activity PL found nearly 2-fold better PiLi. results indicated influence spacing enzymes important factor optimization multienzyme immobilization support.
