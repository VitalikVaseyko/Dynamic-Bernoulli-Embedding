 Mutants isolated S. cerevisiae phenotype growth pyruvate glucose, growth rich medium pyruvate inhibition glucose. Screening mutagenized cultures either without enrichment step, enrichment using antibiotic netropsin (Young et al. 1976) inositol starvation (Henry, Donahue Culbertson 1975). One class mutants lacked pyruvate kinase (pyk), another class enzymes glycolysis, one mutant lacked phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi, Maitra 1971). Partial reversion pyruvate kinase mutants rich medium containing glucose gave double mutants also lacking hexokinase (hxk), phosphofructokinase (fk), several enzymes glycolysis (gcr). diploids mutations recessive. pyk, pgi, pfk, gcr segregated 2:2 wild-type alleles. PYK hxk, PYK pfk, PYK gcr segregrants grew glucose.
