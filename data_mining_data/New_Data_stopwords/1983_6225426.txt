 Specific activity phosphofructokinase 7-8-fold higher exponentially growing human fibroblasts quiescent cells, difference considerably less pronounced two glycolytic enzymes, glucose phosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase. ratio F-type L-type phosphofructokinase subunits essentially growing resting cells, 4:1. F-type-phosphofructokinase-related antigen concentration decreased resting cells compared proliferating fibroblasts, relatively less enzyme activity; ratio enzyme activity antigen concentration (immunological specific activity) therefore lower resting growing fibroblasts. Synthesis phosphofructokinase, percentage total protein synthesis, 30-fold greater proliferative phase quiescent cells, difference 3-4-fold glucose phosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase. Modulation synthesis phosphofructokinase therefore seems responsible changes specific activity function cell proliferation. appearance inactive cross-reacting material quiescent cells probably due post-translational alteration pre-synthesized molecules. Compared glycolytic enzymes, glucose phosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase seems (or one the) preferential target glycolytic induction proliferating cells.
