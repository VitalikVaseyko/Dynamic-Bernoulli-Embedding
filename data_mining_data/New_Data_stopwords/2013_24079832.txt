 Tumour cells thrive environments would hostile normal cell counterparts. Survival depends selection cell lines harbour modifications both, gene regulation shifts balance cell cycle apoptosis involve plasticity metabolic machinery. regards metabolism, selected phenotypes usually display enhanced anaerobic glycolysis even presence oxygen, so-called Warburg effect, anabolic pathways provide precursors synthesis lipids, proteins DNA. review discuss original ideas Otto Warburg initially led notion mitochondria tumour cells dysfunctional. Data presented show organelles viable respiring, key players tumorigenesis metastasis. Likewise, interconnecting pathways stand tumour phenotype require intact mitochondria glutaminolysis addressed. Furthermore, comments made peculiarities biochemistry tumour cells renders amenable new forms treatment highlighting possible targets inhibitors. respect, case study describing effect metabolite analogue, alkylating agent 3BP (3-bromopyruvate), glycolytic enzyme targets presented.
