 Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), muscle-eye-brain (MEB) disease clinically similar autosomal recessive disorders characterized congenital muscular dystrophy, cobblestone lissencephaly, eye anomalies. Among them, WWS severe syndrome. Causative genes FCMD (Fukutin), WWS (POMT1), MEB (POMGnT1) identified. vast majority Japanese FCMD patients carry least one copy ancestral founder insertion mutation. Patients homozygous insertion show milder phenotype compound heterozygotes, carrying insertion combination missense nonsense mutation allele. Japanese FCMD patients identified nonfounder mutations alleles. Turkish boy characteristics WWS detected homozygous nonsense mutation exon 5 Fukutin. first case worldwide Fukutin mutation found outside Japanese population. Later, another Turkish boy WWS phenotype found homozygous nonsense mutation exon 4 Fukutin. two Turkish boys represent severe end phenotypic spectrum Fukutin mutations. Japanese FCMD patients carrying least one copy founder mutation noncoding region may produce lower level mature Fukutin normal generate relatively mild FCMD phenotype. homozygous nonsense mutations within coding region identified Turkish patients predicted cause total loss fukutin activity likely produce severe phenotype closely resembles WWS.
