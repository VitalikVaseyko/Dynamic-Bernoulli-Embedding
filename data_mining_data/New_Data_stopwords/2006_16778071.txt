 studied metabolic rate, cellular energetic state, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activation, expression enzymes involved energy metabolism using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes oxygen range 21 1 kPa. Oxygen dependence factors assessed gradually reducing oxygen supply cells 21 kPa 10, 5, 2, 1 kPa. Moreover, time course experiments 20 h oxygen tensions 1 2 kPa carried out. Reduction oxygen 21 kPa 10, 5, 2, 1 kPa decreased metabolic rate cells 14, 24, 37, 46%, respectively. response instantaneous fully reversible upon reoxygenation. Cellular ATP content expression mRNAs studied decreased oxygen reduced 21 5 2 kPa. lowest ATP levels, approximately 43% initial value, measured 5 kPa oxygen, whereas reduction mRNA amounts pronounced 2 kPa. 1 kPa oxygen tension, ATP content mRNA amounts returned normoxic (21 kPa) levels concomitant activation HIF-1, indicating reorganization energy metabolism adaptation cells low oxygen supply. results show oxygen direct regulatory effect metabolism trout hepatocyte cultures, supporting view oxygen profound role metabolic regulation cells.
