 Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase use ATP nucleoside triphosphates phosphate donor. responds hyperbolically ATP isocitrate dehydrogenase. kinase inhibited sigmoidally low concentrations DL-isocitrate hyperbolically ADP, AMP, NADPH, phosphoenolpyruvate several effectors. Isocitrate dehydrogenase phosphatase requires nucleotide activity; ADP ATP best activators. phosphatase responds hyperbolically ADP ATP, Mg2+ ions phosphorylated isocitrate dehydrogenase. phosphatase activated twofold threefold AMP, oxaloacetate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate DL-isocitrate. inhibited hyperbolically NADPH. pH optima Km values substrates kinase phosphatase reported. propose role phosphorylation isocitrate dehydrogenase growth Escherichia coli acetate render enzyme rate-limiting citric acid cycle; cause increase level isocitrate divert flux carbon glyoxylate bypass. suggest phosphorylation state isocitrate dehydrogenase intact cells controlled levels isocitrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, NADPH adenine nucleotides. theory explain many recent observations control activity isocitrate dehydrogenase.
