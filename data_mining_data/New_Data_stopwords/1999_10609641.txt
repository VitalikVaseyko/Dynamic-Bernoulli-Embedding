 Two members ATP-dependent class phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases (PEPCKs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens) comparatively studied regard oxaloacetate (OAA) decarboxylase pyruvate kinase-like activities. pyruvate kinase-like activities dependent presence Mn2+; concentrations Mg2+ effective. activities synergistically activated combination metal ions. Vmax activities A. succiniciproducens S. cerevisiae PEPCKs 0.13% 1.2% principal reaction, respectively. OAA decarboxylase activity nucleotide independent and, decreasing order effectiveness, activities supported Mn2+ Mg2+. AMP activator reactions. Vmax OAA decarboxylase activities A. succiniciproducens S. cerevisiae PEPCKs 4% 0.2% PEP-forming reaction, respectively.
