 Bovine type pyruvate kinase reversibly denatured solutions guanidine-HCl. Subsequent dilution enzyme buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol dithiothreitol results recovery enzymatic activity half-times vary 185 min 0 degrees C 4 min 45 degrees C. temperature range 0-25 degrees C, 90% enzymatic activity recovered. 32 degrees C, recovery drops sharply, wih yield 13% 45 degrees C. Removal inactive nonspecific aggregates denatured monomer gel filtration yields enzyme specific activity starting material. enzyme concentrations 3 microns/mL 16 degrees C 25 micron/mL 7.8 degrees C, reactivation kinetics show concentration dependence. higher concentrations protein temperatures 16 degrees C higher, protein concentration dependence seen, rate reactivation described two first-order relaxations. rate constants apparent activation energies 10.6 11.9 kcal/mol. Combinding results presented earlier work laboratory [Cardenas, J. M., & Dyson, R. D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6938-6944; Cardenas, J. M., Hubbard, D. R., & Anderson, S. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 191-197] leads conclusion rapid, major folding produces two species undergo transconformational steps. followed subunit association yields native tetramer.
