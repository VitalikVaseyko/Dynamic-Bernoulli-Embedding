 tumour cells use aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) support anabolic growth evade apoptosis. Intriguingly, molecular mechanisms link Warburg effect suppression apoptosis well understood. study, using loss-of-function studies vitro vivo, show anti-apoptotic protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)14 promotes aerobic glycolysis human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) maintaining low activity pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), key regulator Warburg effect. Notably, PARP14 highly expressed HCC primary tumours associated poor patient prognosis. Mechanistically, PARP14 inhibits pro-apoptotic kinase JNK1, results activation PKM2 phosphorylation Thr365. Moreover, targeting PARP14 enhances sensitization HCC cells anti-HCC agents. findings indicate PARP14-JNK1-PKM2 regulatory axis important determinant Warburg effect tumour cells provide mechanistic link apoptosis metabolism.
