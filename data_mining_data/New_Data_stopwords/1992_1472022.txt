 Five Dnase 1 footprints, termed boxes L1 L5, characterized 280 bp upstream cap site L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene. bind 3' 5', factors HNF1, HNF4, MLTF, non-identified protein referred L5 binding factor (L5-BF). elements, individually variably combined, tested cell-free transcription. L1 box stimulates L-PK TK promoters, context L-PK promoter, cooperates L3 element reach high level transcriptional activation. L3 L4 elements exhibit weaker influences, increased homologous heterologous interactions. L5 box behaves promoter-dependent negative regulatory element.
