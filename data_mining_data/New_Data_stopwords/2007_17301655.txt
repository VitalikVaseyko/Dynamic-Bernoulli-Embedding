 BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal cancer tumour markers valuable detection recurrence following resection monitoring response chemotherapy. CEA, CA19-9, CA-50 CA72-4 currently available nonspecific low sensitivity. 'Tumour M2-pyruvate kinase' described Eigenbrodt around 1985. cancers active tetrameric form M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase converted inactive dimeric form direct interaction oncoproteins channel glucose carbons DNA synthesis. review summarizes current knowledge unique tumour marker regard biochemistry, assay potential use diagnostic screening tool gastrointestinal cancer. METHODS: literature search conducted entries 1980 2005 using PubMed NeLH databases using tumour M2-pyruvate kinase, faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase, tumour metabolism, tumour markers carcinoembryonic antigen keywords. total 56 references relevant tumour M2-pyruvate kinase retrieved. Eighteen references clinical studies involving plasma/faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase gastrointestinal cancer. remaining 38 references clinical/nonclinical trials reviews tumour metabolism plasma/faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase assay. Seven 18 clinical studies involved faecal M2-pyruvate kinase. Three 11 plasma tumour M2-pyruvate kinase studies non-English language excluded. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive negative predictive value plasma/serum tumour M2-pyruvate kinase detection gastrointestinal cancer determined remaining eight studies. Data gastrointestinal cancer M2-pyruvate kinase compared gastrointestinal cancer markers. Data three eight studies using diagnostic cut-off value 15 U/ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma tumour M2-pyruvate kinase analysed together small meta-analysis. RESULTS: diagnostic cut-off value 15 U/ml tumour M2-pyruvate kinase EDTA plasma sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive negative predictive value 57.3, 89, 85.7 64.8%, respectively, colorectal cancers, 62.1, 89, 88 64%, respectively, gastric/oesophageal cancers 72.5, 89, 58 94%, respectively, pancreatic cancers. faecal marker colorectal cancers, faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase sensitivity 73-92% cut-off value 4 U/ml 50% sensitivity Guaiac faecal test. CONCLUSION: Circulating tumour M2-pyruvate kinase commonly elevated oesophageal, gastric colorectal cancer patients conventional tumour markers. Faecal M2-pyruvate kinase sensitive marker colorectal cancer. clinical role tumour M2-pyruvate kinase gastrointestinal cancer management investigated large-scale clinical trials.
