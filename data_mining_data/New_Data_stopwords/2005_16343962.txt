 determined effect dietary starch growth performance feed utilization European sea bass juveniles. Data dietary regulation key hepatic enzymes glycolytic, gluconeogenic, lipogenic amino acid metabolic pathways (hexokinase, HK; glucokinase, GK; pyruvate kinase, PK; fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, FBPase; glucose-6-phosphatase, G6Pase; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PD; alanine aminotransferase, ALAT; aspartate aminotransferase, ASAT glutamate dehydrogenase, GDH) also measured. Five isonitrogenous (48% crude protein) isolipidic (14% crude lipids) diets formulated contain 10% normal starch (diet NS10), 10% waxy starch (diet WS10), 20% normal starch (diet NS20), 20% waxy starch (diet WS20) starch (control diet). Another diet formulated carbohydrate, contained 68% crude protein 14% crude lipids (diet HP). experimental diet fed triplicate groups 30 fish (initial weight: 23.3 g) equivalent feeding scheme 12 weeks. best growth performance feed efficiency achieved fish fed HP diet. Neither level nature starch measurable effects growth performance sea bass juveniles. Digestibility starch higher waxy starch decreased increasing levels starch diet. Whole-body composition plasma metabolites, mainly glycemia, affected level nature dietary starch. Data enzyme activities suggest dietary carbohydrates significantly improve protein utilization associated increased glycolytic enzyme activities (GK PK), well decreased gluconeogenic (FBPase) amino acid catabolic (GDH) enzyme activities. nature dietary carbohydrates tested little influence performance criteria.
