 following non-invasive stool tests colorectal cancer (CRC) screening exist: guaiac immunochemical fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), genetic stool tests M2-PK. Currently widely used tests guaiac-based (gFOBT). Several randomized controlled trials shown gFOBT able achieve reduction CRC-related mortality. reduction achieved detecting asymptomatic cancers early stage better prognosis. However, gFOBT low sensitivity colorectal adenomas thus unlikely able reduce incidence CRC. Furthermore, gFOBT specific human blood influenced external factors. Immunochemical tests (iFOBT) detect human blood stool. two recent randomized studies Netherlands comparing guaiac immunochemical tests asymptomatic population, iFOBT found detect cancers gFOBT. Furthermore, iFOBT able detect advanced adenomas thus potential able reduce incidence CRC well CRC-related mortality. recently released European CRC screening guidelines, iFOBT considered screening test choice. Several questions remain however. currently unknown optimal cut-off value iFOBT considered positive number stool samples required. Genetic stool tests detect mutations stool found CRC. original test testing 21 genetic changes found superior gFOBT detection cancers. However, sensitivity moderate (51.6%) sensitivity advanced adenomas low. meantime test modified improving DNA extraction reducing number mutations tested well including methylation marker. efficacy modified test screening population unknown. M2-PK isomer enzyme pyruvate kinase involved glycolysis. Studies found good sensitivity cancers, low sensitivity advanced adenomas specificity around 80%. studies screening population required.
