 order detect covalent reaction intermediates 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase reaction, investigated interaction EPSP synthase reaction product EPSP. exchange EPSP-methylene protons could demonstrated incubating EPSPS EPSP D2O. Since trace amounts contaminating Pi would lead reversal EPSPS reaction hence methylene proton exchange, added pyruvate kinase, ADP, Mg++ K+. conditions, contaminating Pi converted PEP trapped ATP. exchange EPSP protons solvent could detected presence trap system, suggesting enzyme-bound EPSP unable form covalent tetrahedral complex. Incorporation [14C] [14C]-S3P [14C]-PEP EPSP could detected, absence PEP (or Pi) trap system. indicates exchange reaction, Pi required, also indicates absence covalent intermediate, unless carboxyvinyl-enzyme-bound S3P completely restricted exchange.
