 failure pancreas transplantation normalize plasma glucagon concentration insulin: glucagon balance portal blood recently demonstrated streptozotocin-diabetic rats. experimental model used present study examine effect pancreas transplantation liver carbohydrate metabolism. Twenty weeks pancreas transplantation, left hepatic lobe removed studies several glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes. Livers nontransplanted diabetic rats showed decreased activities glycolytic enzymes enhanced activities gluconeogenic enzymes. recipients pancreas transplants, however, activities glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes differ observed normal control rats. concluded alterations hepatic gluconeogenesis glycolysis observed streptozotocin-diabetic rats restored normal pancreas transplant despite failure obviate hyperglucagonaemia.
