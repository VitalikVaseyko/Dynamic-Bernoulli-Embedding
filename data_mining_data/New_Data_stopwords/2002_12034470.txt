 previously provided evidence diffusion metabolites across porin pores mitochondrial outer membrane hindered. functional consequence diffusion limitation dynamic compartmentation ADP intermembrane space. earlier studies done isolated mitochondria suspended isotonic media without macromolecules, intermembrane space mitochondria enlarged. present study undertaken assess diffusion limitation outer membrane presence 10% (w/v) dextran M20, order mimic action cytosolic macromolecules mitochondria. conditions, mitochondria native, condensed configuration.Flux-dependent concentration gradients ADP estimated measuring ADP diffusion fluxes across porin pores isolated rat heart mitochondria incubated together pyruvate kinase (PK), compete ADP regenerated mitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) within intermembrane space yeast hexokinase (HK) extramitochondrially. diffusion fluxes bulk phase concentrations ADP, concentrations intermembrane space calculated using Fick's law diffusion. Flux-dependent gradients 23 microM ADP (for diffusion rate J(Dif)=1.9 micromol ADP/min/mg mitochondrial protein) observed. gradients twice estimated absence dextran order magnitude cytosolic ADP concentration (30 microM), negligibly low cytosolic ATP (5 mM). Therefore, concluded dynamic ADP compartmentation biological importance intact heart cells. mtCK generates ADP within intermembrane space, local ADP concentration clearly higher cytosol resulting higher extramitochondrial phosphorylation potentials. way, mtCK contributes ensure optimal kinetic conditions ATP-splitting reactions extramitochondrial compartment.
