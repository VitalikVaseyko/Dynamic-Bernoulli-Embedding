 AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) serine threonine kinase functions fuel sensor regulate energy balance cellular whole-body levels. studied hepatic AMPKalpha2 isoform affects hepatic glucose production peripheral glucose uptake vivo. generated mice deleted AMPKalpha2 gene specifically liver (liveralpha2KO). Liveralpha2KO mice glucose intolerant hyperglycemic fasted state. Hyperglycemia associated 50% higher endogenous glucose production controls assessed vivo. investigated whether increased glucose production sensitive insulin. Insulin, infused rate inducing physiological hyperinsulinemia, totally inhibited endogenous glucose production liveralpha2KO mice, showing normal insulin sensitivity. confirmed vivo normal insulin-induced phosphorylation Akt transcriptional regulation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6 phosphatase, pyruvate kinase liver fasted/fed transition. Leptin adiponectin regulate hepatic glucose production, infused adipokines liveralpha2KO mice. Neither adipokines regulated hepatic glucose production mice lacking hepatic AMPKalpha2, whereas control mice. conclusion, show hepatic AMPKalpha2 isoform essential suppressing hepatic glucose production maintaining fasting blood glucose levels physiological range. also demonstrate regulation hepatic glucose production leptin adiponectin, insulin, requires hepatic AMPKalpha2 activity.
