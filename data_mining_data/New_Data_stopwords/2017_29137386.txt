 Background: shift oxygen phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis known Warburg effect characteristic cancer cell metabolism facilitating metastasis. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), key ion channel mediates Ca(2+) uptake mitochondria, found promote cancer progression metastasis. However, explicit role shifting metabolism breast cancer cells defined. Methods: evaluated MCU overexpression knock-down migration, invasion glucose metabolismin breast cancer cells. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics monitored Rhod-2 fluorescence imaging. Luciferase reporter assay used confirm interaction miR-340 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) MCU gene. Mouse models lung metastasis used determine whether gain-/loss-of-MCU impacts metastasis. MCU expression assessed 60 tumor samples breast cancer patients immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Knockdown MCU MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced cell migration invasion vitro lung metastasis vivo; whereas overexpression MCU MCF-7 cells significantly increased migration invasion vitro lung metastasis vivo. Overexpression MCU promoted lung metastasis enhancing glycolysis, whereas suppression MCU abolished effect. Moreover, novel mechanism identified MCU direct target microRNA-340, suppressed breast cancer cell motility inhibiting glycolysis. Consistently, significantly increased MCU protein found metastatic breast cancer patients. Conclusions: identified novel mechanism upregulated MCU promotes breast cancer metastasis via enhancing glycolysis, process posttranscriptionally negatively regulated microRNA-340.
