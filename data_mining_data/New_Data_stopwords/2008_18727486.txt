 Susceptibility infectious diseases long known genetic component human populations. genetic effect often complex difficult study modified environmental factors including disease-causing pathogen itself. laboratory mouse proved useful alternative implement genetic approach study host defenses infections. laboratory used genetic analysis positional cloning characterize single multi-gene effects regulating inter-strain differences susceptibility A/J C57BL/6J mice infection several bacterial parasitic pathogens. led identification several proteins including Nrampl (Slc11a1), Birc1e, Icsbp, C5a, others play critical roles antimicrobial defenses macrophages intracellular pathogens. use AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains facilitated characterization single gene effects complex traits susceptibility malaria. genetic identification erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (Pklr) myeloid pantetheinase enzymes (Vnn1/3) key regulators blood-stage parasitemia suggested cellular redox potential may key biochemical determinant Plasmodium parasite replication. Expanding types studies additional inbred strains emerging stocks mutagenized mice undoubtedly continue unravel molecular basis host defense infections.
