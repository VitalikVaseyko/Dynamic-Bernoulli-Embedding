 Glucagon N,(6)O(2)-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (Bt(2)cAMP) inhibit fatty acid synthesis acetate 90% prevent citrate formation chick hepatocytes metabolizing glucose. substrates enter glycolysis triose-phosphates, e.g., fructose, lactate, pyruvate, Bt(2)cAMP effect citrate level inhibitory effect fatty acid synthesis substantially reversed. acetyl-CoA carboxylase requires tricarboxylic acid activator activity, proposed regulation fatty acid synthesis Bt(2)cAMP due, part, changes citrate level. Reduced citrate formation appears result cAMP-induced inhibition glycolysis. Bt(2)cAMP inhibits (14)CO(2) production [1-(14)C]-, [6-(14)C]-, [U-(14)C]glucose little effect (14)CO(2) formation [1-(14)C]- [2-(14)C]pyruvate [1-(14)C]fructose. [(14)C]Lactate formation glucose depressed 50% Bt(2)cAMP. presence inhibitor mitochondrial pyruvate transport lactate accumulation enhanced, continues lowered 50% Bt(2)cAMP. activity phosphofructokinase greatly decreased Bt(2)cAMP-treated cells activities pyruvate kinase acetyl-CoA carboxylase unaffected. appears decreased glycolytic flux decreased citrate formation result depressed phosphofructokinase activity. Fatty acid synthesis [(14)C]acetate partially inhibited Bt(2)cAMP presence fructose, lactate, pyruvate despite high citrate level. Incorporation [(14)C]fructose, [(14)C]pyruvate, [(14)C]lactate fatty acids similarly depressed Bt(2)cAMP. Synthesis cholesterol [(14)C]acetate [2-(14)C]pyruvate unaffected Bt(2)cAMP. results implicate second site inhibition fatty acid synthesis Bt(2)cAMP involves utilization, production, cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA.-Clarke, S.
