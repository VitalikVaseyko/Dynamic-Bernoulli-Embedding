 Expression mammalian pyruvate kinase (PKM) gene provides important example mutually exclusive splicing. showed previously hnRNP proteins A1, A2 PTB crucial role process. provide evidence concentration-dependent interactions involving network proteins sufficient determine outcome PKM splicing. high concentrations, found cancer cells, hnRNPA1 binding two sites upstream regulated exon (exon 9) orchestrates cooperative interactions leading exon 9 exclusion. lower concentrations, binding shifts downstream intronic sites, exon 9 included exon 10 mainly excluded, mRNA including exons degraded nonsense-mediated decay. Together, results provide mechanism general factors control alternative splicing widely expressed transcript.
