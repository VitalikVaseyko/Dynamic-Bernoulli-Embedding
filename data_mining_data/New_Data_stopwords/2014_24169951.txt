 bioprocess engineering, growth continuous cell lines mainly studied respect changes cell concentration, resulting demand substrates, accumulation extracellular metabolites. underlying metabolic process rests upon intracellular metabolite pools interaction enzymes form substrates, products, allosteric effectors. Here, quantitatively analyze time courses 29 intracellular metabolites adherent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cultivation serum-containing medium serum-free medium. cells, originated pre-culture, showed similar overall growth behavior slight differences demand substrates glucose (GLC), glutamine (GLN), glutamate (GLU). Analysis intracellular metabolites, mainly cover glycolytic pathway, citric acid cycle, nucleotide pools, revealed surprisingly similar dynamics cultivation conditions. Instead strong influence medium, rather observed growth phase-specific behavior glycolysis lower citric acid cycle. Furthermore, analysis lower part glycolysis suggests well-known regulation pyruvate kinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. upper citric acid cycle (citrate, cis-aconitate, isocitrate) apparently uncoupled lower part (alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate), line characteristics truncated cycle. Decreased adenosine triphosphate guanosine triphosphate pools, well relatively low energy charge soon inoculation cells, indicate high demand cellular energy consumption nucleotides biosynthesis. finally conclude that, sufficient availability substrates, dynamics GLC GLN/GLU metabolism influenced mainly cellular growth regime regulatory function key enzymes.
