 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4) play critical role inhibition mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex especially blood glucose levels low pyruvate conserved gluconeogenesis. diabetic conditions, Pdk genes, particularly Pdk4, often induced, elevation Pdk4 gene expression implicated increased gluconeogenesis liver decreased glucose utilization peripheral tissues. However, direct evidence yet show extent dysregulation hepatic Pdk genes attributes hyperglycemia insulin resistance vivo. address question, crossed Pdk2 Pdk4 null mice diabetic model deficient hepatic insulin receptor substrates 1 2 (Irs1/2). Metabolic analyses reveal deletion Pdk4 gene better improvement hyperglycemia glucose tolerance knockout Pdk2 gene whereas Pdk2 gene deletion showed better insulin tolerance compared Pdk4 gene inactivation Irs1/2 knockout genetic background. examine specific hepatic effects Pdks diabetes, also knocked Pdk2 Pdk4 gene using specific shRNAs. data also indicate Pdk4 gene knockdown led better glucose tolerance Pdk2 gene knockdown. conclusion, data suggest hepatic Pdk4 may critically involved pathogenesis diabetes.
