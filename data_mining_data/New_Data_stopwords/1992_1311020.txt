 smooth muscle plasma membrane vesicular fraction (PMV) purified (Ca2+/Mg2+)-ATPase endogenous glycolytic enzyme activity. presence glycolytic substrate (fructose 1,6-diphosphate) cofactors, PMV produced ATP lactate supported calcium uptake. endogenous glycolytic cascade supports calcium uptake independent bath [ATP]. 10-fold dilution PMV, resultant 10-fold dilution glycolytically produced bath [ATP] change glycolytically fueled calcium uptake (nanomoles per milligram protein). Furthermore, calcium uptake fueled endogenous glycolytic cascade persisted presence hexokinase-based ATP trap eliminated calcium uptake fueled exogenously added ATP. Thus, appears endogenous glycolytic cascade fuels calcium uptake PMV via membrane-associated pool ATP via exchange ATP bulk solution. determine whether ATP produced endogenously utilized preferentially calcium pump, ATP production rates endogenous creatine kinase pyruvate kinase matched glycolysis calcium uptake fueled endogenous sources compared fueled exogenous ATP added rate. rate calcium uptake fueled endogenous sources ATP approximately twice supported exogenously added ATP, indicating calcium pump preferentially utilizes ATP produced membrane-bound enzymes.
