 Therapy enzyme inducing drugs may improve glycemic control patients non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. evaluated role mixed function oxidase system glucose metabolism animal model. Rats treated inducer (phenobarbital), inhibitor (cimetidine) hepatotoxin (carbon tetrachloride) week cause alterations liver. mixed function oxidase system assayed determination cytochrome P-450 content NADPH cytochrome c reductase liver. Carbohydrate metabolism evaluated determining blood glucose, enzymes associated glucose phosphorylation liver (glucokinase, hexokinase), glucose storage glycogen enzymatic delivery, glucose-6-phosphatase, peripheral tissue determining phosphorylating enzyme (hexokinase) key glycolytic enzyme (pyruvate kinase) glycogen content muscles. therapy inducer enhanced glucose utilization liver storage muscles. inhibitor decreased mixed function oxidase system, reduced glucose phosphorylating, gluconeogenetic enzymes, liver increased glycolysis muscles. Carbon tetrachloride, hepatotoxin, impaired mixed function oxidase, glucose phosphorylating delivering enzyme activity liver, reduced blood glucose caused glycogen accumulation muscles. function liver microsomal enzyme system seems closely related enzymatic glucose metabolism liver muscles.
