 Glioblastomas brain metastases demonstrate avid uptake 2-[(18) F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography display perturbations intracellular metabolite pools (1) H MRS. observations suggest metabolic reprogramming contributes brain tumor growth vivo. Warburg effect, excess metabolism glucose lactate presence oxygen, hallmark cancer cells culture. 2-[(18) F]Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positive tumors assumed metabolize glucose similar manner, high rates lactate formation relative mitochondrial glucose oxidation, studies specifically examined metabolic fates glucose vivo. particular, capacity human brain cancers oxidize glucose tricarboxylic acid cycle unknown. Here, studied metabolism human brain tumors situ. [U-(13) C]Glucose (uniformly labeled glucose, i.e. d-glucose labeled (13) C six carbons) infused surgical resection, tumor samples subsequently subjected (13) C NMR spectroscopy. analysis tumor metabolites revealed lactate production, expected. also determined pyruvate dehydrogenase, turnover tricarboxylic acid cycle, anaplerosis de novo glutamine glycine synthesis contributed significantly ultimate disposition glucose carbon. Surprisingly, less 50% acetyl-coenzyme pool derived blood-borne glucose, suggesting additional substrates contribute tumor bioenergetics. study illustrates convenient approach capitalizes high information content (13) C NMR spectroscopy enables analysis intermediary metabolism diverse cancers growing native microenvironment.
