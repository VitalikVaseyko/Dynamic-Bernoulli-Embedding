 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) aggressive nearly uniformly fatal malignancy central nervous system. Despite extensive research clinical trials past 50 years, little progress made significantly alter lethal prognosis. current standard care (SOC) includes maximal surgical resection, radiation therapy chemotherapy temozolomide (TMZ), including selective use glucocorticoids symptom control. treatments, however, potential create environment may actually facilitate tumor growth survival. Research investigating unique metabolic needs tumor cells led proposal new metabolic treatment various cancers including GBMs may enhance effectiveness SOC. goal metabolic cancer therapy restrict GBM cells glucose, main energy substrate. recognizing underlying energy production requirements cancer cells, newly proposed metabolic therapy used adjunct standard GBM therapies. review discuss calorie restricted ketogenic diet (CR-KD) promising potential adjunctive metabolic therapy patients GBMs. effectiveness CR-KD based "Warburg Effect" cancer metabolism microenvironment GBM tumors. review recent case reports, clinical studies, review articles, animal model research using CR-KD explain principles Warburg Effect relates CR-KD GBMs.
