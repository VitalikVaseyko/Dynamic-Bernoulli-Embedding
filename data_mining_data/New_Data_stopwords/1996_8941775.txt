 aerobic metabolism lactate oral Actinomyces studied. Six 7 strains Actinomyces naeslundii increased growth presence lactate aerobic conditions. Washed cells grown lactate aerobically degraded lactate pyruvate acetate concomitant consumption oxygen. presence catalase, molar ratios oxygen consumed acetate produced 1 lactate degradation 0.5 pyruvate degradation. enzymatic activities found cell extracts revealed lactate could converted pyruvate NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenase (iLDH) acetyl CoA pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). acetyl CoA formed could metabolized acetate phosphotransacetylase (PTA) acetate kinase (AK) formation ATP. results indicate A. naeslundii metabolizes lactate acetate sequential enzymatic reactions iLDH, PDH, PTA AK hydrogens produced iLDH PDH transferred oxygen. activity lactate degradation oxygen consumption may modify environmental conditions dental plaque.
