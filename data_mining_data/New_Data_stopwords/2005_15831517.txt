 LSN862 novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha/gamma dual agonist unique vitro profile shows improvements glucose lipid levels rodent models type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia. Data vitro binding, cotransfection, cofactor recruitment assays characterize LSN862 high-affinity PPARgamma partial agonist relatively less significant PPARalpha agonist activity. Using assays, rosiglitazone characterized high-affinity PPARgamma full agonist PPARalpha activity. administered Zucker diabetic fatty rats, LSN862 displayed significant glucose triglyceride lowering significantly greater increase adiponectin levels compared rosiglitazone. Expression genes involved metabolic pathways liver two fat depots compound-treated Zucker diabetic fatty rats evaluated. LSN862 significantly elevated mRNA levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 bifunctional enzyme liver lipoprotein lipase fat depots. contrast, LSN862 rosiglitazone decreased phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase liver increased malic enzyme mRNA levels fat. addition, LSN862 examined second rodent model type 2 diabetes, db/db mice. study, LSN862 demonstrated statistically better antidiabetic efficacy compared rosiglitazone equivalent side effect profile. LSN862, rosiglitazone, fenofibrate evaluated humanized apoA1 transgenic mouse. highest dose administered, LSN862 fenofibrate reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas, rosiglitazone increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. LSN862, fenofibrate, rosiglitazone produced maximal increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 65, 54, 30%, respectively. findings show PPARgamma full agonist activity necessary achieve potent efficacious insulin-sensitizing benefits demonstrate therapeutic advantages PPARalpha/gamma dual agonist.
