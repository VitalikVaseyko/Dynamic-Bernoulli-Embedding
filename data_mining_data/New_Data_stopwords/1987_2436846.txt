 order evaluate effects due acute cerebrovascular disease serum cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters, biochemical data 312 patients studied. serum, CK, LD alpha 1 protein fraction showed moderately close relationship severity stroke. CSF could observed relation enzymatic activities (LD, ASAT, CK) severity disease. result found CSF protein ratio CSF albumin/serum albumin, parameters indicative Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) disturbances. Substances intermediate metabolism Central Nervous System (CNS) (lactate pyruvate) evidently raised CSF clear relation CSF concentration severity stroke. indication IgG immunoglobulin abnormalities CSF found. concentration neurotransmitter metabolite 5HIAA CSF significantly higher (in)completed stroke Transient Ischaemic Attack.
