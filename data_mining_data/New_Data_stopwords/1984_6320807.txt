 Increases amount active non-phosphorylated form pyruvate dehydrogenase rat epididymal adipose tissue, result incubation insulin, persist preparation mitochondria also subsequent incubation coupled mitochondria presence respiratory substrates. effect insulin found hormone added directly mitochondria presence absence added plasma membranes. Concentrations several possible regulators pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (ATP, ADP, NADH, NAD+, acetyl-CoA, CoA potassium) measured rat epididymal-adipose-tissue mitochondria incubated conditions differences pyruvate dehydrogenase activity persist result insulin action. alterations found, suggested inhibition kinase principal means insulin activates pyruvate dehydrogenase. intramitochondrial concentration magnesium also unaffected. Differences pyruvate dehydrogenase activity interscapular brown adipose tissue associated manipulation plasma insulin concentrations cold-adapted rats also shown persist preparation subsequent incubation mitochondria presence absence GDP. pointed persistence effect insulin pyruvate dehydrogenase incubated mitochondria facilitate recognition mechanism action hormone. Evidence short-term action insulin involves increase pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase activity rather inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase discussed.
