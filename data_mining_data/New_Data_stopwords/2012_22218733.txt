 Alzheimer's disease (AD) common form dementia elderly individuals associated progressive neurodegeneration human neocortex. Thiamine levels activity thiamine-dependent enzymes reduced brains peripheral tissues patients AD. Genetic studies provided opportunity determine proteins link thiamine AD pathology (ie, transketolase, apolipoprotein E, alpha-1-antitrypsin, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, p53, glycogen synthetase kinase-3beta, c-Fos gene, Sp1 promoter gene, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase-1 gene). reviewed association histopathogenesis neurotransmitters understand relationship thiamine AD pathology. Oral thiamine trials shown improve cognitive function patients AD; however, absorption thiamine poor elderly individuals. early stage thiamine-deficient encephalopathy (Wernicke's encephalopathy), however, parental thiamine used successfully. Therefore, studies needed determine benefits using parental thiamine treatment AD.
