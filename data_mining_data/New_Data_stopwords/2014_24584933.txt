 Cancer cell proliferation metabolically demanding process, requiring high glycolysis, known "Warburg effect," support anabolic growth. Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), steroid receptor coactivator, overexpressed and/or amplified multiple cancer types, including non-steroid targeted cancers, urinary bladder cancer (UBC). However, whether SRC-3 regulates metabolic reprogramming cancer cell growth unknown. Here, reported overexpression SRC-3 accelerated UBC cell growth, accompanied increased expression genes involved glycolysis. Knockdown SRC-3 reduced UBC cell glycolytic rate hypoxia, decreased tumor growth nude mice, reduction proliferating cell nuclear antigen lactate dehydrogenase expression levels. revealed SRC-3 could interact hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha), key transcription factor required glycolysis, coactivate transcriptional activity. SRC-3 recruited promoters HIF1alpha-target genes, glut1 pgk1. positive correlation expression levels SRC-3 Glut1 proteins demonstrated human UBC patient samples. Inhibition glycolysis targeting HK2 LDHA decelerated SRC-3 overexpression-induced cell growth. summary, overexpression SRC-3 promoted glycolysis bladder cancer cells HIF1alpha facilitate tumorigenesis, may intriguing drug target bladder cancer therapy.
