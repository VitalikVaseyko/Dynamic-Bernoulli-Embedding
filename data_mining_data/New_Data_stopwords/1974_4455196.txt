 Kinetic properties rat liver pyruvate kinase type pH7.5 6.5 studied physiological ranges substrates, modifiers Mg(2+) concentrations increasing enzyme concentrations, including estimated cellular concentrations (approx. 0.1mg/ml). Enzyme properties appear unaffected increased enzyme concentration phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate inhibitors incubated enzyme starting reaction ADP. data suggest minimum cellular concentrations MgATP l-alanine provide virtually complete inhibition pyruvate kinase pH7.5. likely cellular control existing pyruvate kinase results strong restoration enzyme activity small physiological amounts fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Decreasing pH 6.5 also restores pyruvate kinase activity, one-third activity presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Neither pyruvate 2-phosphoglycerate cellular concentrations inhibit enzyme significantly.
