 Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) heterogeneous disease exhibiting variable clinical course survival rates. Mutational status immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IGHVs) CLL cells offers useful prognostic information high-risk patients, time economical costs originally prevented routinely used clinical setting. Instead, alternative markers IGHV status, zeta-associated protein (ZAP70) messenger RNA levels often used. report (1)H-NMR-based metabolomics approach examine serum metabolic profiles early stage, untreated CLL patients (Binet stage A) classified basis IGHV mutational status ZAP70. Metabolic profiles CLL patients (n=29) exhibited higher concentrations pyruvate glutamate decreased concentrations isoleucine compared controls (n=9). Differences metabolic profiles unmutated (UM-IGHV; n=10) mutated IGHV (M-IGHV; n=19) patients determined using partial least square discriminatory analysis (PLS-DA; R(2)=0.74, Q(2)=0.36). UM-IGHV patients elevated levels cholesterol, lactate, uridine fumarate, decreased levels pyridoxine, glycerol, 3-hydroxybutyrate methionine concentrations. PLS-DA models derived ZAP70 classifications showed comparatively poor goodness-of-fit values, suggesting IGHV mutational status correlates better disease-related metabolic profiles. results highlight usefulness (1)H-NMR-based metabolomics potential non-invasive prognostic tool identifying CLL disease-state biomarkers.
