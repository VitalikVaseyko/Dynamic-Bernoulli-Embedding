 Many tumor types exhibit impaired Pasteur effect, i.e. despite presence oxygen, glucose consumed extraordinarily high rate compared tissue originate - so-called 'Warburg effect'. Glucose serve source diverse array cellular functions, including energy production, synthesis nucleotides lipids, membrane synthesis generation redox equivalents antioxidative defense. Tumor cells acquire specific enzyme-regulatory mechanisms direct main flux glucose carbons pathways urgently required challenging external conditions varying substrate availability, presence anti-cancer drugs different phases cell cycle. review summarize currently available information tumor-specific expression, activity kinetic properties enzymes involved main pathways glucose metabolism due regard explanation regulatory basis physiological significance Warburg effect. conclude that, besides expression level metabolic enzymes involved glucose metabolism tumor cells, unique tumor-specific pattern isozymes accompanying changes metabolic regulation translation level enable tumor cells drain selfishly blood glucose pool non-transformed cells use sparingly possible.
