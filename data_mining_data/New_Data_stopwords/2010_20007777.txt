 unique glycolytic metabolism solid tumors, known Warburg effect, associated resistance apoptosis enables cancer cells survive. Dichloroacetate (DCA) anticancer agent reverse Warburg effect inhibiting key enzyme cancer cells, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), required process. DCA currently approved cancer treatment USA. Here, present synthesis, characterization, anticancer properties c,t,c-[Pt(NH(3))(2)(O(2)CHCl(2))(2)Cl(2)], mitaplatin, two DCA units appended axial positions six-coordinate Pt(IV) center. negative intracellular redox potential reduces platinum release cisplatin, Pt(II) compound, two equivalents DCA. unique mechanism, mitaplatin thereby attacks nuclear DNA cisplatin mitochondria DCA selectively cancer cells. cytotoxicity mitaplatin variety cancer cell lines equals exceeds known Pt(IV) compounds comparable cisplatin. Mitaplatin alters mitochondrial membrane potential gradient (Deltapsi(m)) cancer cells, promoting apoptosis releasing cytochrome c translocating apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria nucleus. Cisplatin formed upon cellular reduction mitaplatin enters nucleus targets DNA form 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-links characteristic potency anticancer drug. properties mitaplatin manifest ability selectively kill cancer cells cocultured normal fibroblasts partially overcome cisplatin resistance.
