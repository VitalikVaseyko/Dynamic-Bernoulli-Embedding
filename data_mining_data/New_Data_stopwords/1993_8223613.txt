 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae GGS1 gene essential growth glucose readily fermentable sugars. GGS1 gene TPS1 identified encoding subunit trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase complex allelic fdp1, byp1, glc6 cif1 mutations. precise function regulation sugar catabolism unknown. cloned GGS1 homologue distantly related yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. KlGGS1 gene 74% 79% identical nucleotide amino acid sequence level, respectively, S. cerevisiae counterpart. also compared sequence partly homologous products S. cerevisiae genes TPS2 TSL1 code larger subunits trehalose synthase complex TSL1 homologue, TPS3, unknown function. Multiple alignment sequences revealed several particularly well conserved elements. Disruption GGS1 K. lactis caused pleiotropic phenotype S. cerevisiae, i.e. inability grow glucose fructose strongly reduced trehalose content. also studied short-term glucose-induced regulatory effects related cAMP cAMP-dependent protein kinase, i.e. cAMP signal, trehalase activation, trehalose mobilization inactivation fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. effects occur rapidly S. cerevisiae absent Scggs1 mutant. K. lactis effects much slower largely unaffected Klggs1 mutation. hand, glucose strongly induced pyruvate decarboxylase activated potassium transport system K. lactis effects absent Klggs1 mutant. Addition glucose galactose-grown cells Klggs1 mutant caused, S. cerevisiae, intracellular accumulation free glucose sugar phosphates rapid drop ATP inorganic phosphate levels. Glucose transport kinetics wild type Klggs1 mutant derepressed cells cells incubated glucose. isolated phenotypic revertants Klggs1 mutant growth fructose. suppressors characterized had, different extents, diminished glucose uptake derepressed cells cells incubated glucose showed different characteristics. suppressor mutations prevented deregulation glycolysis Klggs1 mutant accumulation free glucose. mutants higher residual uptake activity showed partially restored induction pyruvate decarboxylase activation potassium transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
