 Important advances made recent years study structure pyruvate kinase: amino acid sequence enzymes chicken muscle yeast established three-dimensional structure cat muscle enzyme determined 0.26 nm resolution. Work laboratory shown dialdehyde-ADP (oADP) used affinity label rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase: enzyme incubated cold oADP presence high ADP concentrations, dialyzed incubated 14C-oADP, enzyme inactivates one mole radioactive oADP incorporates per mole enzyme subunit. labeled peptide molecular weight 5900 purified tryptic digest modified enzyme. first 26 residues peptide sequenced sequence identical region chicken muscle enzyme peptide isolated bovine muscle enzyme specifically labeled trinitrobenzenesulfonate. High homology also found region yeast enzyme. suggests isolated peptide part active site; modified amino acid, probably lysine, seems located one alfa helices domain enzyme, according x-ray data.
