 effect chronic intake dietary alcohol upon myocardial enzymes studied rats. Alcohol, comprising 40% dietary calorie content, administered rats 6 12 weeks. assess metabolic changes myocardium, following enzymes measured: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), aldolase (ALD), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), creatine kinase (CK) glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT). activity CK decreased (4.79 +/- 0.99 U X mg-1 protein) 6 weeks alcohol significantly different controls (5.98 +/- 1.44 U X mg-1 protein). 12 weeks CK activity alcoholic rats recovered 5.99 +/- 1.08 U X mg protein-1 approached value found normal myocardium. pronounced decrease found activity MDH: 8.26 +/- 0.69 U X mg protein-1 controls, 6.78 +/- 1.07 U X mg protein-1 5.79 +/- 0.85 U X mg protein-1 alcoholic rats 6 12 weeks, respectively. LDH activity decreased lesser extent, significantly: 2.45 +/- 0.18 U X mg protein-1 controls, 2.11 +/- 0.07 U X mg protein-1 2.06 +/- 0.29 U X mg protein-1 6 12 weeks test. slight, significant, changes observed enzymes investigated (ICDH, ALD, GPT).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
