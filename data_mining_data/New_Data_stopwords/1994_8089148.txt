 Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates erythropoietin gene transcription Hep3B cells subjected hypoxia. HIF-1 activity also induced hypoxia non-erythropoietin-producing cells, suggesting general regulatory role. report RNAs encoding glycolytic enzymes aldolase (ALDA), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), pyruvate kinase induced exposure Hep3B HeLa cells inducers HIF-1 (1% O2, cobalt chloride, desferrioxamine), whereas cycloheximide blocked induction glycolytic RNAs HIF-1 activity. Oligonucleotides ALDA, PGK1, enolase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, phosphofructokinase L (PFKL) genes, containing sequences similar HIF-1 binding site erythropoietin enhancer, specifically bound HIF-1 present crude nuclear extracts affinity-purified preparations. Sequences ALDA, PFKL, PGK1 genes containing HIF-1 binding sites mediated hypoxia-inducible transcription transient expression assays. results support role HIF-1 mediator adaptive responses hypoxia underlie cellular systemic oxygen homeostasis.
