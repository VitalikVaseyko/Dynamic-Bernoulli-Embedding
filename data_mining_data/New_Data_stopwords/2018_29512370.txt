 Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) suppresses T-cell function least part altering cell metabolism. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) increases upon T-cell activation alters cell metabolism favoring differentiation effector cells. effect IDO HIF-1alpha expression activity evaluated. purpose, mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) performed using IDO inhibitor 1-DL-methyl-tryptophan p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha. L-tryptophan degradation cell proliferation assessed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas expression proteins interest western blotting. IDO inhibited cell proliferation, MLR-derived T-cells increased HIF-1alpha p53, whereas decreased c-Myc. Inhibition p53 abrogated IDO-induced HIF-1alpha upregulation. IDO increased p53 transcriptional targets p21 TP53-induced glycolysis apoptosis regulator. transcriptional targets HIF-1alpha c-Myc, hexokinase II lactate dehydrogenase-A decreased IDO. Phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase remained unaffected indicating pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, transcriptional target HIF-1alpha, affected IDO. human alloreactive T-cells, IDO up-regulates HIF-1alpha, inducing p53 overexpression. However, HIF-1alpha remains transcriptionally inactive.
