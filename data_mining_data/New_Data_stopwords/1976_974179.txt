 Alloxan diabetes injections hydrocortisone intact animals 5-7 days resulted sharp decrease NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase rat epididymal adipose tissue. Combined injection insulin hydrocortisone produce decrease enzyme activity. Insulin injections alloxan diabetic rats recovered activity NADP-malate dehydrogenase control. Pyruvate kinase activity decreased diabetes, insulin injections produced decrease enzyme activity diabetic rats. Activities lactate dehydrogenase NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase less decreased diabetes. Comparison lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes spectrum adipose tissue normal diabetic rats revealed considerable increase LDH-1 decrease LDH-4 diabetes. Insulin injections greatly normalized LDH isoenzyme spectrum.
