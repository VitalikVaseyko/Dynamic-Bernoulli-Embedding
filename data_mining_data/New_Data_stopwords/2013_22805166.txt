 BACKGROUND: Erythrocytic pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, first documented Basenjis, common inherited erythroenzymopathy dogs. OBJECTIVES: report 3 new breed-specific PK-LR gene mutations retrospective survey PK mutations mall selected group Beagles West Highland White Terriers (WHWT). ANIMALS: Labrador Retrievers (2 siblings, 5 unrelated), Pugs (2 siblings, 1 unrelated), Beagles (39 anemic, 29 other),WHWTs (22 anemic, 226 nonanemic), Cairn Terrier (n = 1). METHODS: Exons PK-LR gene sequenced genomic DNA young dogs (<2 years) persistent highly regenerative hemolytic anemia. RESULTS: nonsense mutation (c.799C>T) resulting premature stop codon identified anemic Labrador Retriever siblings osteosclerosis, high serum ferritin concentrations, severe hepatic secondary hemochromatosis. Anemic Pug Beagle revealed 2 different missense mutations (c.848T>C, c.994G>A, respectively) resulting intolerable amino acid changes protein structure enzyme function. Breed-specific mutation tests developed. Among biased group 248 WHWTs, 9% 35% homozygous (affected) heterozygous, respectively, previously described mutation (mutant allele frequency 0.26). PK-deficient Cairn Terrier insertion mutation affected WHWTs. selected group 68 Beagles, 35% PK-deficient 3% carriers (0.37). CONCLUSIONS CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Erythrocytic PK deficiency caused different mutations different dog breeds causes chronic severe hemolytic anemia, hemosiderosis, secondary hemochromatosis chronic hemolysis and, yet unexplained osteosclerosis. newly developed breed-specific mutation assays simplify diagnosis PK deficiency.
