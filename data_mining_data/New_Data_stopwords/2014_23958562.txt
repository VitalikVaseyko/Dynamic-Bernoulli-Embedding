 BACKGROUND: establish infection vagina, Trichomonas vaginalis must adapt various environmental cues survival replication. Nutrient competition lactobacilli, major normal vaginal flora, one mechanisms limit growth microorganisms. Additionally, lactobacilli produce H2O2 reduce genital infections caused pathogens. Thus, ability overcome metabolic stresses, glucose restriction (GR), well oxidative stresses, critical T. vaginalis establish infection. METHODS: gain insights molecular mechanisms adaptation GR, utilized next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) quantify gene expression changes upon GR. Autophagy, cytoprotective response starvation, monitored using autophagy-specific staining, autophagy inhibition assay, co-localization autophagosomes lysosomes. RESULTS: demonstrated GR promotes survival T. vaginalis. Besides, GR-cultivated cells exhibit higher H2O2 resistance. RNA-seq data revealed genes involved general energy metabolism downregulated, whereas genes encoding glutamate metabolism-related aminotransferases strikingly upregulated GR. Furthermore, autophagy first identified characterized T. vaginalis GR. CONCLUSIONS: data suggest GR induces metabolic reprogramming, enhancing antioxidant ability autophagy cellular homeostasis maintain survival. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: work led significant advances understanding transcriptional changes response GR also provided possible strategies elicited GR T. vaginalis adapt vaginal microenvironment.
