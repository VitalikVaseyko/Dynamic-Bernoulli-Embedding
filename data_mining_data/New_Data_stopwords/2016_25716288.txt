 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency inherited glycolytic erythroenzymopathy caused mutations PKLR gene. causative mutation feline PKLR gene originally identified Abyssinian Somali cats U.S.A. present study, TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR genotyping assay developed evaluated rapid genotyping large-scale screening mutation. Furthermore, genotyping survey carried population four popular purebred cats Japan determine current mutant allele frequency. assay clearly displayed genotypes feline PK deficiency, indicating suitability large-scale survey well diagnosis. survey demonstrated mutant allele frequency Abyssinian Somali cats high enough warrant measures control prevent disease. mutant allele frequency relatively low Bengal American Shorthair cats; however, testing still carried prevent spread disease. addition, PK deficiency always considered differential diagnosis anemia purebred cats Japan well worldwide.
