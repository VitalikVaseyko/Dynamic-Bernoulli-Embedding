 Measurements glycerate-2,3-P2 hemoglobin developing erythroid cells indicated glycerate-2,3-P2 level rose erythroid differentiation linear relationship hemoglobin level, suggesting presence regulation accumulate substances synchronously. accumulation glycerate-2,3-P2 found primarily attributable increase glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase activity. activities phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase changed favourable glycerate-2,3-P2 accumulation. increase glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase activity shown caused increase enzyme protein. Synthesis glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase protein proved bone marrow erythroid cells reticulocytes.
