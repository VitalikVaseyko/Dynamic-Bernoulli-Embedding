 Exercise training elicits number adaptive changes skeletal muscle result improved metabolic efficiency. molecular mechanisms mediating cellular adaptations exercise training human skeletal muscle unknown. test hypothesis recovery exercise associated transcriptional activation specific genes, six untrained male subjects completed 60-90 min exhaustive one-legged knee extensor exercise five consecutive days. day 5, nuclei isolated biopsies vastus lateralis muscle untrained trained leg exercise trained leg immediately exercise 15 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h recovery. Transcriptional activity uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) genes (relative beta-actin) increased three- sevenfold response exercise, peaking 1-2 h recovery. Increases mRNA levels followed changes transcription, peaking 2 4 h exercise. Lipoprotein lipase carnitine pamitoyltransferase gene transcription mRNA levels showed similar less dramatic induction patterns, increases ranging two- threefold. separate study, single 4-h bout cycling exercise (n = 4) elicited 5 >20-fold increases UCP3, PDK4, HO-1 transcription, suggesting activation genes may related duration intensity exercise. data demonstrate exercise induces transient increases transcription metabolic genes human skeletal muscle. Moreover, findings suggest cumulative effects transient increases transcription recovery consecutive bouts exercise may represent underlying kinetic basis cellular adaptations associated exercise training.
