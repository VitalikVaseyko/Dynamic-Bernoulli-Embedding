 MOTIVATION: Escherichia coli, phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system acts like sensory element able measure flux glycolysis. Since output sensor, phosphorylated form protein EIIA, connected activity global transcription factor Crp, kinetic structural properties system important understanding overall cellular behavior. RESULTS: family mathematical models presented, varying respect degree complexity (number reactions taken account, number parameters) show structurally quantitatively robust behavior. models describe set experimental data relates output sensor specific growth rate. central element responsible structural robustness feed-forward loop glycolysis, namely activation pyruvate kinase reaction metabolite upper part glycolysis. robustness shown variations measured data well variations parameters.
