 BACKGROUND: metabolic phenotype derives disproportionate energy via glycolysis solid tumors, including glioma, leads elevated lactate labeling metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate. Although pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-mediated flux pyruvate acetyl coenzyme indirectly measured detection carbon-13 ((13)C)-labeled bicarbonate, proven difficult visualize (13)C-bicarbonate high enough levels injected [1-(13)C]pyruvate quantitative analysis brain. aim study improve detection (13)C-labeled metabolites, particular bicarbonate, glioma normal brain vivo measure metabolic response dichloroacetate, upregulates PDH activity. METHODS: optimized protocol chemical shift imaging high concentration hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate used improve measurements lactate bicarbonate C6 glioma-transplanted rat brains. Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate injected 45 min dichloroacetate infusion. Metabolite ratios lactate bicarbonate calculated provide improved metrics characterizing tumor metabolism. RESULTS: Glioma normal brain well differentiated lactate-to-bicarbonate ratio (P = .002, n = 5) well bicarbonate (P = .0002) lactate (P = .001), stronger response dichloroacetate observed glioma normal brain. CONCLUSION: results clearly demonstrate first time feasibility quantitatively detecting (13)C-bicarbonate tumor-bearing rat brain vivo, permitting measurement dichloroacetate-modulated changes PDH flux. simultaneous detection lactate bicarbonate provides tool comprehensive analysis glioma metabolism assessment metabolic agents anti-brain cancer drugs.
