 metabolism Clostridium thermocellum notable assimilates sugar via EMP pathway possess pyruvate kinase enzyme. wild type organism, three proposed pathways conversion phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate, differ cofactor usage. One path uses pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), another pathway uses combined activities PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) oxaloacetate decarboxylase (ODC). Yet another pathway, malate shunt, uses combined activities PEPCK, malate dehydrogenase malic enzyme. First showed flux ODC pathway enzyme assay. Flux remaining two pathways (PPDK malate shunt) determined dynamic (13)C labeling. wild-type strain, malate shunt accounts 33+/-2% flux pyruvate, remainder via PPDK pathway. Deletion ppdk gene resulted redirection pyruvate flux malate shunt. provides first direct evidence in-vivo function malate shunt.
