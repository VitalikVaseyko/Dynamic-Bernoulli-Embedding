 Pyruvate kinase (PK) isoenzymes, rate limiting last steps glycolysis, studied normal rat liver, putative preneoplastic foci, neoplastic nodules hepatocellular carcinoma. lesions produced initiation-promotion protocol: treatment single dose N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM) followed feeding diets containing phenobarbital (PB) alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), basal diet. PK demonstrated (i) immunocytochemistry histological sections antibodies specifically directed L M2 isoenzymes, (ii) electrophoretic separation isoenzymes homogenates liver larger tumors, (iii) electrophoretic separation isoenzymes parenchymal stromal cells isolated liver tumors. Immunocytochemistry showed decreases L-PK (L-PK-) hepatocytes foci, nodules carcinomas. L-PK- foci showed increases gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) epoxide hydrolase (EH). PB alpha-HCH treatment decreased expression L-PK foci, normal liver. Cells foci enhanced L-PK (L-PK+) also found carcinogen treatment. show increases gamma-GT EH distinct morphological alterations exception basophilic ('tigroid') H E stained sections. L-PK+ tumors found. could demonstrate M2-type PK parenchymal cells liver lesions described above. isoenzyme restricted stromal cells normal rat liver stages carcinogenesis shown immunohistology electrophoresis preparations isolated cell populations. However, stromal cells hepatocellular carcinomas exhibited 3-fold increase M2-PK compared stromal cells normal liver. results support isoenzyme shift L M2-PK course malignant transformation hepatocytes suggested previously.
