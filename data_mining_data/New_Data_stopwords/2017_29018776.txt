 Duck enteritis virus (DEV) large, complex double-stranded DNA virus induces duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells autophagy, beneficial replication, mechanism described. study, showed impaired cell energy metabolism involved DEV-induced autophagy, whereby ATP synthesis disrupted cells DEV infection, causes metabolic stress activation autophagy. Methyl pyruvate (MP) inhibited conversion LC3I LC3II accumulation GFP-LC3, could reverse energy loss caused DEV infection. Inhibition DEV replication MP confirmed view. found infection DEV activated metabolic regulator 5' AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) inhibited activity mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR). cases AMPK expression inhibited, LC3-I conversion LC3-II ratio decreased, GFP-LC3 point DEV replication; addition, inhibition p-mTOR showed reverse trend. also found tuberous sclerosis (TSC) 2 key mediator AMPK mTOR activation phosphorylation. siRNA targeting TSC2 transfected reverse inhibition mTOR, down-regulate autophagy level DEV replication, AMPK expression changed, siRNA targeting AMPK inhibited activation TSC2. conclusion, findings indicate energy metabolism cell damage induced DEV contributes autophagy via AMPK-TSC2-MTOR signaling pathway, provides new perspective DEV host interactions.
