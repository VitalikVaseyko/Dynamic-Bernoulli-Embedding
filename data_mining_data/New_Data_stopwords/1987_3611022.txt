 dimorphic phycomycete Mucor racemosus found contain five electrophoretic forms pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) depending growth conditions. M. racemosus hyphal cells grown glutamic acid carbon source contained fastest electrophoretic form, designated PK1, yeast cells grown glucose contained slowest electrophoretic form, PK5. Intermediate electrophoretic forms PK2, PK3, PK4 well PK1 PK5 found hyphal cells grown media containing fructose cellibiose. five electrophoretic forms molecular weights ca. 230,000 determined plots log Rm versus acrylamide gel concentration. PK1 PK5 purified homogeneity determined homotetramers, subunit molecular weights 54,000 58,100, respectively. amino acid content PK1 PK5 determined found similar identical. Analysis limited tryptic digests cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments PK1 PK5 indicate subunits two isozymes significantly different.
