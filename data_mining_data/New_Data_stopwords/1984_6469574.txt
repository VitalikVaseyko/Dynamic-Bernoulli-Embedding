 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase deficiency described Arab boy suffering chronic hemolytic anemia. patient probably true homozygous defect. residual enzyme activity red blood cells (RBC) approximately 30% normal. striking enzyme abnormality observed extreme heat lability: upon incubation 45 C, greater 90% activity lost within 15 min. Furthermore, increased affinity substrate glucose-6-phosphate shown. lability enzyme also shown exist vivo separating patient's RBC four fractions different cell age centrifugation discontinuous density gradient. vivo lability enzyme believed main cause hemolytic diathesis. Remarkably, residual activity enzyme RBC obligate heterozygotes comparable patient. However, enzyme activity slightly labile normal RBC consequently signs hemolysis noticed.
