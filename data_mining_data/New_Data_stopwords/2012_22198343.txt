 Mitochondrial NADPH generation largely dependent inner-membrane nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT), catalyzes reduction NADP(+) NADPH utilizing proton gradient driving force NADH electron donor. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing NNT PC12 cells results decreased cellular NADPH levels, altered redox status cell terms decreased GSH/GSSG ratios increased H(2)O(2) levels, thus leading increased redox potential (a oxidized redox state). NNT knockdown results decrease oxidative phosphorylation anaerobic glycolysis levels remain unchanged. Decreased oxidative phosphorylation associated a) inhibition mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) activity; b) reduction NADH availability, c) decline mitochondrial membrane potential, d) decrease ATP levels. Moreover, alteration redox status actually precedes impairment mitochondrial bioenergetics. possible mechanism could activation redox-sensitive c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) translocation mitochondrion leads inhibition PDH (upon phosphorylation) induction intrinsic apoptosis, resulting decreased cell viability. study supports notion oxidized cellular redox state decline cellular bioenergetics - consequence NNT knockdown - cannot viewed independent events, rather interdependent relationship coordinated mitochondrial energy-redox axis. Disruption electron flux fuel substrates redox components due NNT suppression induces mitochondrial dysfunction also cellular disorders redox-sensitive signaling.
