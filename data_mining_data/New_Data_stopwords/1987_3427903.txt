 1. Growing male kittens fed 18% casein diet supplemented 2, 3, 4% L-methionine (MET) 6 weeks. 2. Free MET concentration liver increased 30-fold cystathionine two- three-fold; activity adenosyl-MET transferase cystathionase also increased remained lower previously found rats. 3. Taurine concentration liver decreased cats fed excess MET appeared depend taurine intake. 4. Alanine aminotransferase activity high groups serine dehydratase activity low. 5. Pyruvate kinase malic enzyme activities normally low cat liver increased excess MET. Also, glucose 6-phosphate 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases increased. 6. Cat liver metabolism showed limited adaptation excess dietary intake methionine compared found rats.
