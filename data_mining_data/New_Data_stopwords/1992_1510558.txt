 Strain X4 isolated several years ago anaerobic mesophilic plant treating vegetable cannery waste waters. first example propionic fermentation ethanol. Morphologic physiologic characterizations strain presented here. strain described type strain new species, Clostridium neopropionicum sp. nov. Whole cells strain X4 ferment [1-13C] ethanol CO2 [2-13C] propionate, [1-13C] acetate [2-13C] propanol, suggesting absence randomizing pathway propionate formation. Enzymes involved fermentation assayed cell-free extracts cells grown ethanol sole substrate. Alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, phosphate acetyl transferase, acetate kinase, pyruvate synthase, lactate dehydrogenases, enzymes acrylate pathway detected activities sufficient involved ethanol fermentation. pathway may used degradation lactate acrylate acetate.
