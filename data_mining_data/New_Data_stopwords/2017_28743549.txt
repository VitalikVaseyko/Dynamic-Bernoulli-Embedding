 Apoptotic death pancreatic beta cells major cause type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) progression. Two isoforms pyruvate kinase, PKM1 PKM2, reported participate cell death several cell types; however, little known causal pathways pancreatic beta-cell death. examined whether suppression PKM1 PKM2 affects endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis pancreatic beta-cell line, MIN6, Beta-TC-6 found knockdown PKM1, PKM2, leads induction ER stress-induced apoptosis cells. also investigated mechanism PKM1 inhibits ER stress-induced apoptosis. confirmed PKM1 interacts A-Raf, upstream regulator MEK/ERK pathway, interaction contributes MEK1 phosphorylation A-Raf. PKM1 knockdown suppresses phosphorylation MEK, ERK, caspase-9 (Thr125), phosphorylated MEK/ERK pathway, thereby inhibiting cleavage activation caspase-9. Thus, PKM1 knockdown activates caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway ER stress conditions leads apoptosis.
