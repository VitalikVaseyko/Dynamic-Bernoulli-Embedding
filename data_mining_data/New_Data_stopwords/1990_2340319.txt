 effect pH main kinetic parameters pyruvate kinase function studied. maximal rate reaction well values Km ADP Ki phenylalanine depend pH show well-defined extremum pH 6.8-7.0. Spectrofluorimetric titration pyruvate kinase results pH dependencies changes fluorescence spectra parameters (e.g., quantum yield, half-width position maximum). enabled determine pH regions corresponding changes state tryptophan residues. Data enzyme inhibition phenylalanine suggest acidification medium leads decrease catalytic activity due protonation ionogenic group enzyme. Within pH range 7.0-8.0, decrease pyruvate kinase activity due structural shifts enzyme molecule, result steric complementariness enzyme active center respect substrate (Mg.ADP) impaired.
