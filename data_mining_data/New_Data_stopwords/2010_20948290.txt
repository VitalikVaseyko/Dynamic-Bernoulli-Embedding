 cancer cell comprising largely carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen sulfur requires glucose, avidly transported converted lactate aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect, also glutamine major substrate. Glutamine essential amino acids, methionine, provide energy TCA cycle well nitrogen, sulfur carbon skeletons growing proliferating cancer cells. interplay utilization glutamine glucose likely depend genetic make-up cancer cell. MYC oncogene induces aerobic glycolysis glutaminolysis, activated beta-catenin induces glutamine synthesis hepatocellular carcinoma. Cancer cells elevated glutamine synthetase use glutamate ammonia synthesize glutamine hence addicted glutamine. such, cancer cells many degrees freedom re-programming cell metabolism, better understanding result novel therapeutic approaches.
