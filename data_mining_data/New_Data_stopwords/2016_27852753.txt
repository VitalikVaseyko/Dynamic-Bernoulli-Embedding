 Cellular mitochondrial metabolic capacity heart suggested limit performance fish warm temperatures. investigated hypothesis studying effects acute temperature increases (16, 23, 30, 32.5 36 degrees C) thermal sensitivity 10 key enzymes governing cardiac oxidative glycolytic metabolism two populations European perch (Perca fluviatilis) field-acclimated 15.5 22.5 degrees C, well effects acclimation cardiac lipid composition. populations perch, activity glycolytic (pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase) tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase citrate synthase) enzymes increased acute warming. However, temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C, drastic thermally induced decline citrate synthase activity observed cold- warm-acclimated populations, respectively, indicating bottleneck producing reducing equivalents required oxidative phosphorylation. Yet, increase aspartate aminotransferase malate dehydrogenase activities occurring populations temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C suggests malate-aspartate shuttle may help maintain cardiac oxidative capacities high temperatures. Warm acclimation resulted reorganization lipid profile, general depression enzymatic activity increased fatty acid metabolism oxidative capacity. Although compensatory mechanisms may help maintain cardiac energy production high temperatures, activity electron transport system enzymes, complexes IV, declined 36 degrees C populations, indicating thermal limit oxidative phosphorylation capacity heart European perch.
