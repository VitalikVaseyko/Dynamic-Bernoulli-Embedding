 therapeutic efficacy imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) based specific inhibition BCR-ABL oncogene protein, widely expressed tyrosine kinase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. goal study evaluate glucose metabolism BCR-ABL-positive cells sensitive imatinib exposure. Two human BCR-ABL-positive cell lines (CML-T1 K562) one BCR-ABL-negative cell line (HC-1) incubated different imatinib concentrations 96 hours. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy cell acid extracts performed evaluate [1-13C]glucose metabolism, energy state, changes endogenous metabolites incubation imatinib. Imatinib induced concentration-dependent inhibition cell proliferation CML-T1 (IC50, 0.69 +/- 0.06 micromol/L) K562 cells (IC50, 0.47 +/- 0.04 micromol/L), HC-1 cells. metabolic changes imatinib-treated HC-1 cells. BCR-ABL-positive cells, relevant therapeutic concentrations imatinib (0.1-1.0 micromol/L) decreased glucose uptake media suppressing glycolytic cell activity (C3-lactate 0.25 mmol/L, 65% K562 77% CML-T1 versus control). Additionally, activity mitochondrial Krebs cycle increased (C4-glutamate 0.25 micromol/L, 147% K562 170% CML-T1). improvement mitochondrial glucose metabolism resulted increased energy state (nucleoside triphosphate/nucleoside diphosphate 0.25 micromol/L, 130% K562 125% CML-T1). Apoptosis observed higher concentrations. Unlike standard chemotherapeutics, imatinib, without cytocidal activity, reverses Warburg effect BCR-ABL-positive cells switching glycolysis mitochondrial glucose metabolism, resulting decreased glucose uptake higher energy state.
