 Cell-free extracts rat brain catalyze reactions purine nucleotide cycle. Ammonia formed deamination amination phase cycle. activity adenylate deaminase brain sufficient account maximum rates ammonia production reported. activity glutamate dehydrogenase sufficient account rates ammonia production. activities adenylosuccinate synthetase adenylosuccinase nearly sufficient account steady state rates ammonia production observed brain. Demonstration cycle extracts brain complicated occurrence side reactions, particular catalyzed phosphomonoesterase, nucleoside phosphorylase, guanase.
