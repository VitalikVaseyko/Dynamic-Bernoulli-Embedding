 Recent experiments suggest existence transcriptional network functions parallel canonical Myc/Max/Mad transcriptional network. Unlike Myc/Max/Mad network, understanding network still infancy. center network Max-like protein called Mlx; hence called network Mlx network. Like Max, Mix interacts transcriptional repressors transcriptional activators, namely Mad family Mondo family, respectively. Similar Max-containing heterodimers, Mlx-containing heterodimers recognize CACGTG E-box elements, suggesting transcriptional targets two networks may overlap. Supporting hypothesis, observed genetic interactions Drosophila melanogaster orthologs Myc Mondo. higher eukaryotes, two proteins, MondoA MondoB/CHREBP/WBSCR14, constitute Mondo family. present little known transcriptional targets MondoA; however, pyruvate kinase putative target MondoB/CHREBP/WBSCR14, suggesting function Mondo family glucose and/or lipid metabolism. Finally, unlike predominant nuclear localization Myc family proteins, Mondo family members localize cytoplasm. Therefore, Myc Mondo families may share biological functions, likely family distinct regulatory control.
