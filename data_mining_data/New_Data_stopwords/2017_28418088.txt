 Phosphorylation Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) Tyr105 fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) shown promote nuclear localization well cell growth lung cancer. Better understanding regulation process would benefit clinical treatment lung cancer. Here, found adaptor protein receptor activated PKC kinase (RACK1) formed complex FGFR1 PKM2, activated FGFR1/PKM2 signaling. Knocking expression RACK1 impaired phosphorylation Tyr105 PKM2 inhibited growth migration lung cancer cells, over-expression RACK1 lung cancer cells led resistance Erdafitinib. Moreover, knocking expression RACK1 impaired tumorigenesis lung cancer driven LKB loss mutated Ras (KrasG12D). Taken together, study demonstrated pivotal roles RACK1 FGFR1/PKM2 signaling, suggesting FGFR1/RACK1/PKM2 might therapeutic target lung cancer treatment.
