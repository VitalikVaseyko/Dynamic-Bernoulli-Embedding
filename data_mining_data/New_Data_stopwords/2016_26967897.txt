 Arsenic one common metalloid contaminants groundwater acute chronic toxicity affecting multiple organs. Details mechanism arsenic toxicity still lacking profile studies metabolic level limited. Using gas chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), first generated metabolomic profiles livers arsenic-treated zebrafish identified 34 significantly altered metabolite peaks potential markers, including four prominent ones: cholic acid, glycylglycine, glycine hypotaurine. Combined results GC/MS, histological examination pathway analyses suggested series alterations, including apoptosis, glycogenolysis, changes amino acid metabolism fatty acid composition, accumulation bile acids fats, disturbance glycolysis related energy metabolism. alterations glycolysis partially resemble Warburg effect commonly observed many cancer cells. However, cellular damages reflected two conventional liver function tests performed, Bilirubin assay alanine aminotransferase (ALT) assay, probably short arsenate exposure insufficient induce detectable damage. study demonstrated metabolic changes could reflect mild liver impairments induced arsenic exposure, underscored potential reporting early liver injury.
