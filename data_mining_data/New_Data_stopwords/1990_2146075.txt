 1. monitoring changes fluorescence NADH frequencies, amplitudes maximum slopes glycolytic oscillator Phormia analyzed 5, 9, 15 21-day-old male flies. 2. order evaluate possible existence circadian rhythms within oscillatory system, determinations repeated eight times/day. 3. addition, activities three key enzymes glycolysis, PFK, GAPDH PK, central glycolytic oscillator measured respect age day time. 4. increasing age amplitudes oscillations increased together maximum slopes oscillatory waves. frequency appeared independent age. 5. Variations enzyme activities day indicated age dependent circadian rhythm which, due simultaneous activity changes three measured enzymes, reflected whole oscillatory system. 6. results suggest modifications allosteric regulation enzymes responsible age dependent changes glycolytic oscillator.
