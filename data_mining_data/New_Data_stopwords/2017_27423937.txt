 G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) possesses pro-oncogenic activity function competitively inhibited (R,R')-4'-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol (MNF) poorly defined signaling pathways. Here, anti-tumorigenic effect MNF investigated human pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1, focusing expression known cancer biomarkers expression function multidrug resistance (MDR) exporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Incubation PANC1 cells MNF (1muM) 24h significantly decreased EGF receptor, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), beta-catenin protein levels accompanied significant reduction nuclear accumulation HIF-1alpha phospho-active forms PKM2 beta-catenin. Inhibition GPR55 either MNF GPR55 antagonist CID 16020046 lowered amount MDR proteins total cellular extracts diminishing nuclear expression Pgp BCRP. significant nuclear accumulation doxorubicin PANC-1 cells treated MNF pre-incubation MNF increased cytotoxicity doxorubicin gemcitabine cells. Potentiation doxorubicin cytotoxicity MNF also observed MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells U87MG glioblastoma cells, express high levels GPR55. data suggest inhibition GPR55 activity produces antitumor effects via attenuation MEK/ERK PI3K-AKT pathways leading reduction expression function MDR proteins.
