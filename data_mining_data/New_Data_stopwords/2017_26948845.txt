 antifungal activity, kinetics, molecular mechanism action garlic oil Candida albicans investigated study using multiple methods. Using poisoned food technique, determined minimum inhibitory concentration garlic oil 0.35 mug/mL. Observation transmission electron microscopy indicated garlic oil could penetrate cellular membrane C. albicans well membranes organelles mitochondria, resulting organelle destruction ultimately cell death. RNA sequencing analysis showed garlic oil induced differential expression critical genes including involved oxidation-reduction processes, pathogenesis, cellular response drugs starvation. Moreover, differentially expressed genes mainly clustered 19 KEGG pathways, representing vital cellular processes oxidative phosphorylation, spliceosome, cell cycle, protein processing endoplasmic reticulum. addition, four upregulated proteins selected two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) analysis identified high probability mass spectrometry putative cytoplasmic adenylate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, hexokinase, heat shock proteins. suggestive C. albicans stress responses garlic oil treatment. hand, large number proteins downregulated, leading significant disruption normal metabolism physical functions C. albicans.
