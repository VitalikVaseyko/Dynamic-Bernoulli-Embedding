 effects dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, phosphorylation alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (pyruvate:lipoamide oxidoreductase (decarboxylating acceptor-acetylating), EC 1.2.4.1, PDH) investigated rat hippocampal slices. Incubating hippocampal slices increasing concentrations DCA resulted increase active portion PDH, without changes total PDH activity, well increase vitro phosphorylation alpha-PDH. effect DCA PDH activity rapid, almost maximal 5 min. results indicate DCA hippocampal slice preparation inhibits PDH kinase consequently stimulates PDH activity decreasing endogenous state phosphorylation. Moreover time-course effect DCA suggests turnover rate phosphate group carried alpha-PDH rapid manipulated altering PDH kinase activity.
