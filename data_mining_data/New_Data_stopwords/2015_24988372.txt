 Downhill folding proteins fold microseconds crossing low free energy barrier (<3 RT), exhibit complex unfolding behavior equilibrium. unfolding complexity due weak thermodynamic coupling exists various structural segments proteins, manifested unfolding curves differ depending structural probe employed monitor process. Probe-dependent unfolding important practical implications permits one investigate folding energy landscape detail using multiprobe thermodynamic experiments. type thermodynamic behavior investigated depth protein BBL, example extreme (one-state) downhill folding free energy barrier condition, including denaturation midpoint. However, open question is, extent thermodynamic behavior observed less extreme downhill folders? perform multiprobe spectroscopic characterization microsecond folder PDD, structural functional homologue BBL folds within downhill regime, example one-state downhill folding; rather denaturation midpoint PDD folds crossing incipient free energy barrier. Model-free analysis unfolding curves four different spectroscopic probes together differential scanning calorimetry reveals dispersion approximately 9 K apparent melting temperature also marked differences unfolding broadness (from approximately 50 approximately 130 kJ mol(-1) analyzed two-state model), confirming properties also observed less extreme downhill folders. subsequently perform global quantitative analysis unfolding data PDD using statistical mechanical model used BBL domain. analysis shows simple model captures features observed unfolding PDD (i.e., intensity temperature dependence different spectroscopic signals). model estimate free energy landscape PDD maximal thermodynamic barrier (i.e., denaturation midpoint) approximately 0.5 RT, consistent previous independent estimates. results highlight multiprobe unfolding experiments equilibrium combined statistical mechanical modeling provide important insights structural events take place unfolding process downhill proteins, thus effectively probe free energy landscape proteins.
