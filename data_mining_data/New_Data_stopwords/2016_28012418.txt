 Cancer cells usually characterized increase glucose uptake compared normal cells, known Warburg effect. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent glucose analogues previously synthesized applied cancer cell imaging. However, NIR dyes usually one charge structures, may cause low cell membrane permeability hamper application cell imaging. reported novel glucose analogue N2, designed synthesized based new type NIR dye, DCPO. expected, higher level N2 uptake observed hepatic carcinoma cells (HepG2) gastric cancer cells (NCI-N87) equivalent cells normal tissues origin, respectively. accumulation N2 cancer cells consistent overexpression glucose transporter GLUT-1 cells. cellular uptake N2 confirmed dependent GLUT-1, evidenced decreased uptake N2 presence d-glucose GLUT-1 inhibitor phloretin. Moreover, uptake N2 cancer cells found concentration- time-dependent manner. all, study demonstrated N2, novel DCPO-conjugated bioprobe, could used monitor cellular glucose consumption, therefore might applied cancer cell bioimaging bioassay cancer studies.
