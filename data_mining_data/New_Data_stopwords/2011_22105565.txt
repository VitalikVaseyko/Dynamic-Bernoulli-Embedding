 Cancer viewed programmed, evolutionarily conserved life-form, rather random series disease-causing mutations, answers rarely asked question cancer cell for, provides meaning otherwise mysterious suite attributes, encourages different type thinking treatment. broad consistent spectrum traits, well-recognized aggressive cancers, group naturally three categories: taxonomy ("phylogenation"), atavism ("re-primitivization") robustness ("adaptive resilience"). parsimonious explanation convergent evolution, release highly conserved survival program, honed exigencies Pre-Cambrian, cancer cell seems better adapted; recreated within, great cost to, host. Central program Warburg Effect, whose malign influence permeates well beyond aerobic glycolysis include biomass interconversion genomic heuristics. Warburg-type metabolism genomic instability targets whose therapeutic disablement major priority.
