 genome sequence Roseovarius sp. strain 217 indicated many pathway enzymes found organisms degradation taurine represented, novel, apparently energy-dependent pathway involved conversion acetyl phosphate acetyl CoA. Thus, ABC transporter taurine could postulated, inducible taurine: pyruvate aminotransferase, alanine dehydrogenase, sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase sulfite dehydrogenase could assayed. Whereas phosphate acetyltransferase found organisms, none indicated genome sequence activity found cell-free extracts. Instead, acetate kinase active acetate-CoA ligase.
