 development new forms treatment advanced renal cell carcinoma past two decades primarily focused targeting VHL/HIF pathway. recent identification mutations chromatin-remodeling genes clear-cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC), genomic heterogeneity, Warburg-like metabolic phenotype advanced disease profound effect understanding evolution ccRCC potential approaches personalized therapy. Early approaches therapy patients advanced type papillary RCC centered around MET/HGF pathway expand genomic information becomes available. Sporadic familial type II papillary renal cell carcinoma characterized enhanced aerobic glycolysis share antioxidant response phenotype. fumarate hydratase-deficient RCC, fumarate-induced succination KEAP1 activates Nrf2 signaling. CUL3 Nrf2 mutations well Nrf2 activation phenotype found sporadic type II papillary RCC. Therapeutic approaches designed target Nrf2 pathway well impair blood flow glucose delivery cancers highly dependent robust tumor vasculature ready availability glucose energy production glycolysis development.
