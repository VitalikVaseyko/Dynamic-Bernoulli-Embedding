 mathematical model glycolysis human erythrocytes proposed study influence pyruvate kinase deficiency energy metabolism. model takes account main regulatory properties non-equilibrium enzymes magnesium-complex formation adenine nucleotides 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. normal case (no enzyme defect) calculated flux rates metabolite concentrations good agreement experimental data. shown severe pyruvate kinase deficiency manifested tenfold diminished activity enzyme leads remarkable decrease glycolytic flux ATP concentration 50% normal values. hand lowering pyruvate kinase activity half normal value, characteristic heterozygotes, gives significant alterations metabolite concentrations flux rates compared normal case accordance lack clinical symptoms metabolic disease probands. three patients known alterations pyruvate kinase mutants calculated metabolite concentrations control characteristics permit estimation degree disorder glycolytic pathway. resulting classification corresponds well independent experimental clinical findings. particular, calculation demonstrates simple correlation lowered enzyme activity reduced flux rate affected pathway.
