 Maintenance cerebral viability function important goal critical care victims injury due ischemia hypovolemia. part multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, brain function trauma influenced systemic inflammatory response. investigated effect EF24, anti-inflammatory bis-chalcone, cerebral bioenergetics rat model 45% hemorrhagic shock. rats treated EF24 (0.4 mg/kg) EF24 artificial oxygen carrier liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH). volume LEH administered equal shed blood. brain collected 6 h shock biochemical assays. EF24 treatment showed significant recovery ATP, phosphocreatine, NAD/NADH ratio. also increased citrate synthase activity cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV expression reduced shock brain. Furthermore, reduced shock-induced accumulation pyruvate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 expression, suggesting EF24 treatment improves cerebral energetics restoring perturbed pyruvate metabolism mitochondria. effects EF24 associated reduced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage significant improvement levels nerve growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor shock brain. Co-administration LEH EF24 marginally effective compared treatment EF24 alone. results show EF24 treatment sets pro-survival phenotype shock resurrecting cerebral bioenergetics. Since EF24 effective absence accompanying fluid resuscitation, potential utility pre-hospital pharmacotherapy shock due accidental blood loss.
