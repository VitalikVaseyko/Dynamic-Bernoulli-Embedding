 Loss fat mass cancer cachexia linked increased adipocyte lipolysis; however, fate excess fatty acids (FA) generated lipolysis known. investigated adipocyte-specific gene cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-alpha-like effector (CIDEA) could involved. CIDEA mRNA expression assessed s.c. white adipose tissue 23 cancer cachexia patients, 17 weight-stable cancer patients, 8 noncancer patients. CIDEA also overexpressed adipocytes vitro. CIDEA expression increased cancer cachexia (P < 0.05) correlated elevated levels FAs reported weight loss (P < 0.001). CIDEA overexpression vitro increased FA oxidation 2- 4-fold (P < 0.01), decreased glucose oxidation 40% (P < 0.01), increased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1 PDK4 (P < 0.01), enhanced phosphorylation (inactivation) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Inactivation PDC facilitates FA oxidation favoring metabolism FAs glucose acetyl-CoA. accordance vitro data, PDK1 PDK4 expression correlated strongly CIDEA expression white adipose tissue (P < 0.001). conclude CIDEA involved adipose tissue loss cancer cachexia may, least part, due ability inactivate PDC, thereby switching substrate oxidation human fat cells glucose FAs.
