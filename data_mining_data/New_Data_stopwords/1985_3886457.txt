 Short-term effects human proinsulin metabolic rates long-term action enzyme induction studied primary cultures rat hepatocytes perfused rat liver, compared effects bovine insulin. perfused rat liver, proinsulin decreased glucagon-dependent increase glycogenolysis. action 0.5 nM glucagon almost completely suppressed 100 nM proinsulin. Proinsulin insulin showed similar potency. cultured rat hepatocytes, proinsulin stimulated glycolysis fivefold half-maximal effective dose 30 nM. Proinsulin induced key glycolytic enzymes glucokinase pyruvate kinase twofold antagonized glucagon-dependent induction phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase half-maximal effective dose 3 nM. effects cultured hepatocytes, 100-fold higher concentrations proinsulin insulin required.
