 Homocysteine amino acid important risk factor several neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's Parkinson's disease. Increased homocysteine levels induce neuronal cell death variety neuronal types. However, studies probed effects homocysteine astrocytes. present study investigated effects homocysteine primary cultures astrocytes exposing astrocytes 400 microM homocysteine 20 h. Metabolic extracts cells prepared following 4-h incubation minimum medium 5.5 mM [U-(13)C]glucose presence absence homocysteine analysed using (13)C NMR. expression level pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDK-2), NAD(P)H levels mitochondrial membrane potential responses investigated following culture homocysteine. Metabolomic analysis performed using (1)H NMR spectroscopy pattern recognition analysis. Following incubation homocysteine significant decrease (48%) ratio flux pyruvate carboxylase (PC) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) due increased flux PDH. addition, homocysteine culture resulted significant reduction PDK-2 protein expression. Following stimulation glucose significant increase NAD(P)H levels impaired hyperpolarisation mitochondrial membrane homocysteine-treated cells. Metabolomic analysis showed discriminating metabolites following homocysteine treatment choline hypotaurine. summary, results demonstrated sub-lethal concentrations homocysteine caused significant metabolic changes altered mitochondrial function primary cultures astrocytes.
