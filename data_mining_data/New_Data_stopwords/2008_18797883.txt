 INTRODUCTION: Solid tumors, neuroblastoma (NB), associated heterogeneous cell environment. Multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) cultures shown better mimic growth characteristics vivo solid tumors. tumor spheroid growth patterns may quite different standard two-dimensional culture systems, sought compare protein expression profiles two- three-dimensional vitro NB cultures, i.e., monolayers MCTS. MATERIALS METHODS: Human NB cells grown monolayers spheres. Nuclear cytosolic proteins analyzed differentially secreted proteins two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) selected polypeptides identified mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Several metabolic (transketolase, triosephosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase M1/M2, alpha enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase-1), cell stress response (heat shock proteins (HSP) 90, 70, 60; antioxidant, thioredoxin), cell structure (septin 2, adenyl cyclase-associated protein-1), tubulin beta-2 chain, actin, translationally controlled tumor protein cofilin), signal transduction (peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase A), biosynthetic (phosphoserine aminotransferase) transport (cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1) polypeptides overexpressed spheroids. Several protein groups differentially expressed NB monolayers spheroids. CONCLUSION: altered proteins among NB spheroids may represent important link monolayer cell cultures vivo experiments thus ideal vitro culture system determining precise three-dimensional microenvironment NB.
