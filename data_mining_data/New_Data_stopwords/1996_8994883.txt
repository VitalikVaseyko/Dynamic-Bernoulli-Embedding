 New three-dimensional structures allosteric proteins reveal flexible architecture instrumental regulation protein function. Highlights structures GroEL, pyruvate kinase, D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase acetylcholine receptor. Furthermore, significant progress understanding nature intermediates involved allosteric reaction achieved recent spectroscopic crystallographic studies haemoglobin.
