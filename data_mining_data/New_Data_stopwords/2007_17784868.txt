 OBJECTIVE & METHOD: dimeric form pyruvate kinase isoenzyme (tumour M2-PK) predominantly found highly proliferating cells. Sandwich ELISA monoclonal antibodies dimeric (tumour) M2-PK used measure faecal tumour M2-PK in; 13 controls, 10 patients colonic polyps 32 patients colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Levels faecal tumour M2-PK higher patients colorectal cancer (median 11.72 U/ml; range 0.9-146.95 U/ml, P = 0.0001) polyps greater 10 mm (median 2.54 U/ml; range 0.9-29.46 U/ml, P = 0.041) compared controls (median 1.75 U/ml; range 0.9-3.41 U/ml). Furthermore, levels higher stages Duke's B (P = 0.013) Duke's C (P = 0.43) Duke's A. Six months postsurgery faecal tumour M2-PK levels fell significantly 3.46 U/ml (range 1.03-9.05 U/ml, P = 0.001). sensitivity positive faecal tumour M2-PK test, defined level 3.33 U/ml, 91% colorectal cancer, 60% >10 mm 20% <10 mm polyps, specificity 92%. CONCLUSION: Faecal tumour M2-PK highly sensitive marker colorectal cancer larger polyps. also correlates advanced stages colorectal cancer reduction associated successful surgical intervention.
