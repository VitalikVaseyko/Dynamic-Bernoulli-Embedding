 non-nervous tissues, glucocorticoids (GCs) counteract effects insulin stimulate gluconeogenesis. present study designed investigate whether adrenalectomy (ADX) glucocorticoid substitution influence pathway glucose glycogen metabolism cerebral parietotemporal cortex hippocampus, how. activities respective key enzymes, hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphorylase (PLa), concentrations intermediates, glucose (Glu), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F16PP), pyruvate (Pyr), lactate (Lac), glycogen (Glyc) glucose-1-phosphate (G1P), measured brains 1-year-old male Wistar rats controlled conditions 3 days ADX sham operation pilot study ADX substitution corticosterone (CST) suspended sesame oil ADX subcutaneous administration vehicle only. increase glycolytic flux glycogen breakdown decrease gluconeogenesis cerebral cortex hippocampus observed ADX. substitution CST adrenalectomized rats effect ADX enzyme activities reversed: significant differences adrenalectomized rats received vehicle shown PK G6Pase activities areas rat brain investigated.
