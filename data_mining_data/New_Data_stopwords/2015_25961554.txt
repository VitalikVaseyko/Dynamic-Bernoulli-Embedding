 Despite intense scientific efforts made, still many tumors difficult treat percentage patient survival long-term still low. Thus, new approaches treatment cancer needed. Cancer highly heterogeneous complex disease, whose development requires reorganization cell metabolism. tumor cells downregulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation increase rate glucose consumption lactate release, independently oxygen availability (Warburg effect). metabolic rewiring largely believed favour tumor growth survival, although underlying molecular mechanisms completely understood. Importantly, correlation aerobic glycolysis cancer widely regarded useful biochemical basis development novel anticancer strategies. Among enzymes involved glycolysis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) emerging attractive target possible pharmacological approaches cancer therapy. review addresses state art perspectives concerning LDH useful diagnostic marker relevant molecular target cancer therapy management.
