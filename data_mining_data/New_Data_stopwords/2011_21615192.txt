 classification endocrine tumors defines pheochromocytoma tumor arising chromaffin cells adrenal medulla - intra-adrenal paraganglioma. Closely related tumors extra-adrenal sympathetic parasympathetic paraganglia classified extra-adrenal paragangliomas. Almost pheochromocytomas paragangliomas produce catecholamines. concentrations catecholamines pheochromocytoma tissues enormous, potentially creating volcano erupt time. Significant eruptions result catecholamine storms called "attacks" "spells". Acute catecholamine crisis strike unexpectedly, leaving traumatic memories acute medical disaster champions intensive care unit. well-defined genotype-biochemical phenotype relationship exists, guiding proper cost-effective genetic testing patients tumors. Currently, production norepinephrine epinephrine optimally assessed measurement O-methylated metabolites, normetanephrine metanephrine, respectively. Dopamine minor component, paragangliomas produce catecholamine together norepinephrine. Methoxytyramine, O-methylated metabolite dopamine, best biochemical marker tumors. patients equivocal biochemical results, modified clonidine suppression test coupled measurement plasma normetanephrine recently introduced. addition differences catecholamine enzyme expression, presence either constitutive regulated secretory pathways contributes unique mutation-dependent catecholamine production release, resulting various clinical presentations. Oxidative stress results significant imbalance levels prooxidants, generated oxidative phosphorylation, antioxidants. gradual accumulation prooxidants due metabolic oxidative stress results proto-oncogene activation, tumor suppressor gene inactivation, DNA damage, genomic instability. Since mitochondria serves main source prooxidants, mitochondrial impairment leads severe oxidative stress, major outcome tumor development. terms cancer pathogenesis, pheochromocytomas paragangliomas represent tumors oxidative phosphorylation defect due mutation succinate dehydrogenase cause, consequence, tumor development. succinate dehydrogenase pathogenic mutation results shift oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis cytoplasm (also called anaerobic glycolysis hypoxia main cause shift). phenomenon, also called Warburg effect, well demonstrated positive [18F]-fluorodeoxyglycose positron emission tomography scan. Microarray studies, genome-wide association studies, proteomics protein arrays, metabolomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics approaches remain powerful tools uncover pathogenesis tumors unique markers, ultimate goal introduce new therapeutic options metastatic malignant pheochromocytoma paraganglioma. Soon oxidative stress tightly linked multistep cancer process mutation various genes (perhaps logistic way) ultimately results uncontrolled growth, proliferation, metastatic potential practically cell. Targeting mTORC, IGF-1, HIF pathways, topoisomerases, protein degradation proteosomes, balancing activity protein kinases phosphatases even synchronizing cell cycle exposure kind therapy soon become reality. Facing reality today favor chances "beat" disease tomorrow.
