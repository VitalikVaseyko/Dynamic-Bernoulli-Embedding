 Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) key glycolytic enzyme, highly expressed tumor cells, plays pivotal role growth, survival metabolism reprogramming cancer cells. Besides location cytoplasm glycolytic enzyme location nucleus protein kinase, extracellular PKM2 present serum feces tumor patients. However, little known secretion PKM2 significance progression colon cancer. demonstrated PKM2 could secreted colon cancer cells, purified PKM2 protein mimicing secreted PKM2 able promote colon cancer cell migration. Moreover, PI3K/Akt Wnt/beta-catenin signaling involved secreted PKM2 induced colon cancer cell migration. results reveal critical roles secreted PKM2 progression colon cancer, indicate PKM2 may therapeutic target colon cancer.
