 well established stromal niche exerts protective effect chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, thereby also affecting drug sensitivity. One hallmark malignant cells metabolic reprogramming, mostly represented glycolytic shift known Warburg effect. treatment resistance linked metabolic alterations, investigated whether bone marrow stromal cells impact bioenergetics primary CLL cells. fact, stromal contact led increase aerobic glycolysis cells' overall glycolytic capacity accompanied increased glucose uptake, expression glucose transporter, glycolytic enzymes. Activation Notch signaling direct transcriptional target c-Myc contributed metabolic switch. Based observations, CLL cells' acquired increased glucose dependency well Notch-c-Myc signaling could therapeutically exploited effort overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance.
