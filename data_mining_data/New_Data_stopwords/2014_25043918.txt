 Otto Warburg observed cancerous cells prefer fermentative instead oxidative metabolism glucose, although former theory less efficient. Since Warburg's pioneering works, special attention given difference cell metabolism. Warburg effect implicated cell transformation, immortalization, proliferation tumorigenesis. Cancer cells display enhanced glycolytic activity, correlated high proliferation, thus, glycolysis appears excellent candidate target cancer cells. Nevertheless, little attention given noncancerous cells exhibit "Warburg-like" metabolism slight, perhaps crucial, alterations may provide new directions develop new effective anticancer therapies. Within testis, somatic Sertoli cell (SC) presents several common metabolic features analogous cancer cells, clear "Warburg-like" metabolism. Nevertheless, SCs actively proliferate specific time period, ceasing divide species puberty, become terminally differentiated. special metabolic features SC, well progression immature proliferative state, mature nonproliferative state, high glycolytic activity maintained, make cells unique good model discuss new perspectives Warburg effect. Herein provide new insight somatic SC may source new exciting information concerning Warburg effect cell proliferation.
