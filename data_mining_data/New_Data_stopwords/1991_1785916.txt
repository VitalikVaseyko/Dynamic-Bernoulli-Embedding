 effects benzoic acid preservative-resistant yeast Zygosaccharomyces bailii studied. concentrations benzoic acid 4 mM, fermentation stimulated low levels benzoate accumulated. Near MIC (10 mM), fermentation inhibited, ATP levels declined, benzoate accumulated relatively higher levels. Intracellular pH reduced greatly. Changes levels metabolites different external benzoic acid levels showed glycolysis limited pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase-phosphoglycerate kinase steps. Inhibition phosphofructokinase several glycolytic enzymes responsible inhibition fermentation. Instead, results suggest primary action benzoic acid Z. bailii cause general energy loss, i.e., ATP depletion.
