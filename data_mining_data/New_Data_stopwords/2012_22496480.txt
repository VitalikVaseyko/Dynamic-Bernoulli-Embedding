 One hallmark cancer cells adaptation rely upon altered metabolic scheme includes changes glycolytic pathway, known Warburg effect, elevated glutamine metabolism. Glutaminase, mitochondrial enzyme, plays key role metabolism glutamine cancer cells, inhibition could significantly impact malignant transformation. small molecule 968, dibenzophenanthridine, recently shown inhibit recombinantly expressed glutaminase C, block proliferation anchorage-independent colony formation human cancer cells culture, inhibit tumor formation mouse xenograft models. Here, examine structure-activity relationship leads 968-based inhibition glutaminase cancer cell proliferation, focusing upon "hot-spot" ring previously identified critical 968 activity. find hot-spot ring must substituted large, nonplanar functionality (e.g., t-butyl group) bestow activity series, leading us model whereby molecule binds glutaminase previously undescribed allosteric site. conduct docking studies locate potential 968-binding sites proceed test specific set docking solutions via site-directed mutagenesis. verify results initial assay 968 analogues cellular studies using MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.
