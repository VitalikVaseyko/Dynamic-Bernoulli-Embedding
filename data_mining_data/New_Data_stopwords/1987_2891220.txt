 Preneoplastic liver lesions produced female Wistar rats application 25 mg/kg N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM), 14 mg/kg diethylnitrosamine (DENA), 0.075 mg/kg aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) 160 mg/kg safrole. carcinogens administered two equal doses 12 24 h partial hepatectomy. animals received sodium phenobarbital (0.1% tap water) 410 days. Numerous altered hepatic foci (AHF) hyperplastic nodules (HN) detected enzyme histochemically negative ATPase reaction application AFB1, DENA NNM; AHF HN also caused weak carcinogen safrole. Immunohistochemically lesions also L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK)-negative high coincidence regard number area. results confirm role L-PK, enzyme affecting pentose phosphate pathway, negative marker preneoplastic liver lesions.
