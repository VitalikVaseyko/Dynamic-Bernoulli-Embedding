 nature rat liver protein phosphatases involved dephosphorylation glycolytic key enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase regulatory enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase investigated. terms classification system proposed Ingebritsen & Cohen [(1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 132, 255-261], type-2 protein phosphatases 2A (which separated 2A1 2A2) 2C act substrates. Fractionation rat liver extracts anion-exchange chromatography gel filtration revealed protein phosphatase 2A responsible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase phosphatase activity (activity ratio 2A/2C = 4:1). hand, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase phosphatase activity equally distributed protein phosphatases 2A (2A1 plus 2A2) 2C. addition, possible role low-Mr compounds control purified protein phosphatase 2C examined. near-physiological concentrations, none metabolites studied significantly affected rate dephosphorylation 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.
