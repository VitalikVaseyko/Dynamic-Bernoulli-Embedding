 Metabolic changes contribute differentiation well understood. Overwhelming evidence shows critical role glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) directing metabolism proliferating cells. However, role metabolism differentiating cells unclear. studied role PK phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation human leukemia K562 cells. observed PMA treatment decreased cancer-type anabolic metabolism increased ATP production, along up-regulated expression two PK isoforms (PKM2 PKR) ERK2-dependent manner. Interestingly, silencing PK (PKM2 PKR) inhibited PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation, revealed decreased expression megakaryocytic differentiation marker CD61 cell cycle behavior. Further, PMA-induced ATP production reduced greatly upon PK silencing, suggesting PK required ATP synthesis. addition metabolic effects, PMA treatment also translocated PKM2, PKR, nucleus. ERK1/2 knockdowns independently together suggested role ERK2 up-regulation isoforms PK, proposing role ERK2-PK isoform axis differentiation. Collectively, findings unravel ERK2 guided PK-dependent metabolic changes PMA induction, important megakaryocytic differentiation.
