 Previously, showed drs contributes suppression malignant tumor formation drs-knockout (KO) mice. study, demonstrate regulation glucose metabolism drs using comparisons drs-KO wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Extracellular acidification, lactate concentration, glucose consumption drs-KO cells significantly greater WT cells. Metabolomic analyses also confirmed enhanced glycolysis drs-KO cells. Among glycolysis-regulating proteins, expression lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-B upregulated post-transcriptional level drs-KO cells increased LDH-B expression, LDH activity, acidification culture medium drs-KO cells suppressed retroviral rescue drs, indicating LDH-B plays critical role glycolysis regulation mediated drs. WT cells transformed activated K-ras, expression endogenous drs mRNA markedly suppressed LDH-B expression increased. human cancer cell lines low drs expression, LDH-B expression increased. Database analyses also showed correlation downregulation drs upregulation LDH-B human colorectal cancer lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Furthermore, LDH inhibitor suppressed anchorage-independent growth human cancer cells MEF cells transformed activated K-ras. results indicate drs regulates glucose metabolism via LDH-B. Downregulating drs may contribute Warburg effect, closely associated malignant progression cancer cells.
