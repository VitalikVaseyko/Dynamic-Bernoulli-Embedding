 Electrospraying stable cone-jet mode <400 microm substrate shown powerful technique produce arrays identical micrometer-sized spots consisting biologically active substances. Aqueous solutions surface tension 0.04 N m(-1) conductivities ranging 0.04 2.2 m(-1) sprayed ultralow flow rates ranging 100 300 pL s(-1). charged jet emanates cone tip breaks spray charged droplets deposited form uniform spot 130-350 microm diameter spraying 0.5-3 220-400 microm substrate, respectively. spot deposited, spraying stopped instantaneously increasing distance capillary tip substrate additional 100 microm using computer-controlled x-y-z table. immediately followed rapid shift substrate 400 microm sideways 100 microm upward, thus causing spraying resume instantaneously increased electric field strength, resulted deposition next spot. shown spraying lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH), pyruvate kinase (PK) liquid layer resulted complete preservation activities despite high solution conductivity 3.3 m(-1) high currents ranging 300 500 nA. LDH PK activities fully preserved spraying onto dry aluminum adding 0.05 buffer 0.5 1 wt % trehalose, respectively, spray solutions. Electrospraying allows accurate dispensing liquid volumes small 50 pL. Enzymatic activities LDH PK fully preserved spraying.
