 Theileria annulata infects bovine leukocytes, transforming invasive, cancer-like cells cause widespread disease called tropical theileriosis. report Theileria-transformed leukocytes hexokinase-2 (HK2) binds B cell lymphoma-2-associated death promoter (BAD) serine (S) 155 BAD phosphorylated. show HK2 recruitment BAD abolished cell-penetrating peptide acts nonphosphorylatable BAD substrate inhibits endogenous S155 phosphorylation, leading complex dissociation ubiquitination degradation HK2 proteasome. HK2 critical enzyme involved Warburg glycolysis, loss forces Theileria-transformed macrophages switch back HK1-dependent oxidative glycolysis down-regulates macrophage proliferation growing glucose. growing galactose, degradation HK2 effect Theileria-infected leukocyte proliferation, metabolism sugar independent hexokinases. Thus, targeted disruption phosphorylation-dependent HK2/BAD complex may represent novel approach control Theileria-transformed leukocyte proliferation.
