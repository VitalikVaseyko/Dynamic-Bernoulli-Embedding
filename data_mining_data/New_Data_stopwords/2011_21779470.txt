 Growth factor signaling drives increased glucose uptake glycolysis-the Warburg effect-that supports macromolecular synthesis necessary cell growth proliferation. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), direct glucose-induced transcriptional target MondoA, potent negative regulator glucose uptake utilization. Thus, TXNIP may inhibit cell growth restricting substrate availability macromolecular synthesis. determine TXNIP's contribution metabolic reprogramming, examined MondoA TXNIP cells exit quiescence enter G(1). Serum stimulation quiescent immortal diploid fibroblasts resulted acute upregulation glucose uptake glycolysis coinciding downregulation TXNIP expression. Ectopic expression either MondoA TXNIP restricted cell growth blocking glucose uptake. Mechanistically, Ras-MAPK PI3K/Akt signaling inhibit TXNIP translation MondoA-dependent TXNIP transcription, respectively. propose coordinated downregulation MondoA transcriptional activity TXNIP promoter inhibition TXNIP translation key components metabolic reprogramming required cells exit quiescence.
