 Increasing prevalence methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) worldwide limited therapeutic options growing public health concern. Natural products shown possess antibacterial actions MRSA. Flavonoids natural products shown possess antibacterial actions MRSA antagonizing resistance mechanisms. Diosmin diosmetin natural flavonoids found variety citrus fruits. aim study investigate whether diosmin diosmetin could inhibit growth MRSA vitro enzymatic activity newly discovered MRSA drug target, pyruvate kinase (PK). using panel MRSA strains known resistant mechanisms, neither diosmin diosmetin shown possess direct antibacterial activities tested MRSA strains. However, checkerboard assay, found diosmetin together erythromycin, could synergistically inhibit growth ABC-pump overexpressed MRSA-RN4220/pUL5054, time kill assay also showed antibacterial activities diosmetin erythromycin bactericidal. Diosmetin shown significantly suppress MRSA PK activities dose dependent manner. conclusion, inhibition MRSA PK diosmetin could lead deficiency ATP affect bacterial efflux pump might contribute antibacterial actions diosmetin MRSA.
