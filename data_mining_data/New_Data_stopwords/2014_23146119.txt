 SIGNIFICANCE: herein review recent advances role exerted protein redox machines engaged tumor progression, focusing cell adhesion migration, regulation transcriptional response, tumor metabolic reprogramming, features belonging new hallmarks cancer. RECENT ADVANCES: Several recent insights reported oxidative stress, either due intracellular sources oxidants, frequently deregulated cancers microenvironment factors hypoxia stromal cell contact, plays key role tumor malignancy, well metabolic pathways control. Indeed, many proteins behave sensors intracellular oxidative stress, including protein tyrosine kinases phosphatases, transcription factors p53, forkhead box class-Os, nuclear respiratory factor-2, nuclear factor-kB, hypoxia inducible factor, enzymes involved glycolysis penthose phosphate pathway pyruvate kinase-M2 adenylate monophosphate kinase, DNA repair enzymes Ataxia Teleangectasia Mutated. proteins reported play essential roles cancer progression sensitivity oxidative stress added new levels complexity cancer field. CRITICAL ISSUES: Main significant issues need addressed redox cancer biology (i) sensitivity different level oxidative stress sensors, is, respond different oxidative insults/signals, (ii) real susceptibility cancer cells redox-based therapies due acknowledged plasticity cancer cells develop adoptive strategies. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Definitely, redox machines potentiality develop novel biomarkers related target therapies attain goal personalized medicine fight cancer.
