 activity glycolytic oxidative enzymes monitored white muscle Atlantic cod Gadus morhua experiencing different growth rates. strong positive relationship activity two glycolytic enzymes individual growth rate observed regardless whether enzyme activity expressed units per gram wet mass, units per gram dry mass respect muscle protein DNA content. sensitive response growth rate observed pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activities expressed units per microgram DNA, may useful indicator growth rate wild fish. contrast, relationship activities oxidative enzymes growth rate observed cytochrome c oxidase citrate synthase activities expressed units per gram protein. Apparently, aerobic capacity white muscle cod specifically increased match growth rate.
