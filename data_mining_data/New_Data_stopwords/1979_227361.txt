 synthesis series SS'-polymethylenebis(methanethiosulphonates) including pentane, hexane, octane, decane dodecane derivatives described. derivatives synthesized condensation dibromoalkanes potassium methanethiosulphonate refluxing methanol seems especially versatile reaction synthesis asymmetric thiosulphonate derivatives. synthesis SS'-[1,8-3H4]-octamethylenebis(methanethiosulphonate) also perfomed. Cross-linking demonstrated four enzymes lactate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. four enzymes cross-linking efficiently reversed reducing conditions denaturing solvents. reaction glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase unique cross-linked dimer produced significant amounts (greater 90% total products dimer). reaction followed detail radioactive cross-linking reagent. Inhibition enzyme activity extremely fast showed asymmetric distribution enzyme activity subunits. Thus complete modification one subunit resulted 75% inhibition enzyme activity. Reaction glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1.25 mol SS'-octamethylenebis(methanethiosulphonate) per mol enzyme subunit produced two species protein. first species obtained 20% yield partially re-activated mild reduction 2-mercaptoethanol. second species isolated 66% yield completely re-activated mild reduction. reduction 4 mol inhibitor per tetramer latter species, 95% enzyme present dimer non-reducing electrophoresis. mild reduction 2 mol inhibitor still bound per tetramer, enzyme catalytically active dimer still major structure non-reducing electrophoresis. Thus mild reduction SS'-octamethylenebis(methanethiosulphonate-treated glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase enabled production active enzyme stable cross-link across one molecular axes tetrameric enzyme. cross-link reversed reduction performed enzyme denatured. molecular weight cross-linked re-activated cross-linked glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase established 144000 (tetramer) sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation. observations interpreted terms molecular structure glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
