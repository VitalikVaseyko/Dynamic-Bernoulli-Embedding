 Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis allows adapt nutrient-poor microenvironments, thereby imposing selection aggressive variants. However, mechanisms underlying reprogramming fully understood. Using complementary approaches validated cell lines freshly obtained human specimens, report mitochondrial respiration oxidative phosphorylation slowed metastatic melanomas, even normoxic conditions due persistence high nuclear expression hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Pharmacologic genetic blockades HIF-1alpha pathway decreased glycolysis promoted mitochondrial respiration via specific reduction expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3 (PDK3). Inhibiting PDK3 activity dichloroacetate (DCA) siRNA-mediated attenuation sufficient increase pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. Notably, DCA potentiated antitumor effects elesclomol, pro-oxidative drug currently clinical development, limiting cell proliferation promoting cell death. Interestingly, combination also effective BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma cells resistant BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. Cotreatment melanomas DCA elesclomol vivo achieved durable response single agent alone. findings offer preclinical validation HIF-1/PDK3 bioenergetic pathway new target therapeutic intervention metastatic melanoma, opening door innovative combinations might eradicate disease.
