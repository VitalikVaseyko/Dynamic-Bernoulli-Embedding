 Evidence suggests plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA), critical maintaining low intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), utilizes glycolytically derived ATP pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) inhibition glycolysis PDAC cell lines results ATP depletion, PMCA inhibition, irreversible [Ca(2+)]i overload. explored whether specific weakness highly glycolytic PDAC shifting PDAC cell (MIA PaCa-2 PANC-1) metabolism highly glycolytic phenotype toward mitochondrial metabolism assessing effects mitochondrial versus glycolytic inhibitors ATP depletion, PMCA inhibition, [Ca(2+)]i overload. highly glycolytic phenotype cells first reversed depriving MIA PaCa-2 PANC-1 cells glucose supplementing alpha-ketoisocaproate galactose. culture conditions resulted significant decrease glycolytic flux proliferation rate, conferred resistance ATP depletion glycolytic inhibition sensitizing cells mitochondrial inhibition. Moreover, direct contrast cells exhibiting high glycolytic rate, glycolytic inhibition effect PMCA activity resting [Ca(2+)]i alpha-ketoisocaproate- galactose-cultured cells, suggesting glycolytic dependence PMCA specific vulnerability PDAC cells exhibiting Warburg phenotype.
