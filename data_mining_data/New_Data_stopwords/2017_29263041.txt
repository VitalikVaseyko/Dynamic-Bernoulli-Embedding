 BACKGROUND: M2 type Pyruvate kinase (PKM2) key rate-limiting enzyme glycolysis, mainly exists dimer tumor cells. study aims establish enzyme kinetic assay serum tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (TuM2-PK), evaluate diagnostic value breast cancer. METHODS: catalytic kinetics Pyruvate Kinase (PK) examined. allosteric regulation property Michaelis constant measured. Next, levels TuM2-PK serum detected compared results enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, levels TuM2-PK among breast cancer patients, post-mastectomy patients, patients benign breast diseases, healthy controls compared. RESULTS: PK kinetic assay established study. assay reaction time 108 seconds, optimum pH level 8.0. presence allosteric activator fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), Km PK phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 0.15 mmol/L Vmax 330 mumol/min. levels TuM2-PK serum obtained enzyme kinetics comparable ELISA results. assays showed TuM2-PK breast cancer patients increased stage IV. Importantly, TuM2-PK levels significantly different early late-stage breast cancer patients (stage stage II vs. stage III IV), well late-stage non-malignant patients (p<0.05). statistical difference found benign breast disease patients healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: enzyme kinetic assay serum TuM2-PK successfully established may useful breast cancer diagnosis.
