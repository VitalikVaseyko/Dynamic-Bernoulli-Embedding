 Mutations fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP) associated spectrum diseases mild limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I severe congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C, muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS). effect mutations transportation mutant proteins may constitute underlying mechanisms pathogenesis diseases. examined subcellular localization mouse human normal mutant FKRP proteins cells muscle vivo. normal human mouse FKRPs localize part Golgi apparatus muscle fibers. Mutations FKRP gene invariably altered localization protein, leading endoplasmic reticulum retention within cells diminished Golgi localization muscle fibers. results therefore suggest individual missense point mutation confer least two independent effects protein, causing (1) reduction loss presumed glycosyltransferase activity directly (2) mislocalization could alter function protein. complexity effect individual missense point mutations may partly explain wide variation FKRP-related myopathies.
