 INTRODUCTION: Colonoscopy currently supposed best screening tool colorectal cancer. However, acceptance population poor although included screening programs German health system since 2002. Therefore, evaluation additional screening tools seems great interest. Recently testing fecal occult blood (FOBT), genetic alterations alterations tumor metabolism (e.g., tumor M2-PK) investigation. METHODS: use M2-PK measurement feces reported 6 studies today. data studies analyzed critically reviewed. RESULTS: overall sensitivity M2-PK 77.9% concerning CRC. Specificity ranges 74.3-83.3%. Overall sensitivity adenomas 45.9%, increasing 61.1% adenomas > 1 cm. high percentage positive results (90.4%) also observed patients chronic inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS: Compared FOBT genetic testing M2-PK test seems superior CRC screening. Concerning handling, effectiveness analysis, M2-PK seems good possibility large scale-screening colorectal carcinoma. might even used detect larger adenomas. Elevated levels M2-PK patients acute and/or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases probably due proliferation epithelial cells leucocytes inflammatory area.
