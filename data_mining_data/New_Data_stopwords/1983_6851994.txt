 Investigations activity kinetic behavior red cell pyruvate kinase erythrocyte membrane hemolysate 6 patients pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency presented compared normal individuals. Hemolysate: PK hemolysate normal individuals showed well-known allosteric properties, reflected sigmoidal reaction kinetics (Hill-coefficient greater 1). contrast findings enzymes 4 patients splenectomised satisfactory condition showed 15 35% PK activity normal individuals hemolysates, whereas case 2 splenectomised patients 5 15% activity could measured. patients' enzymes showed non allosteric (hyperbolic) reaction kinetics (Hill-coefficient approximately 1.0). Red cell membranes: studies confirmed earlier reports hemolysate patients, also red cell membranes ('ghosts') exhibit PK activity. normal individuals activity membrane-localised PK 5% cytoplasmatic one. case membrane-localised enzyme patients--irrespective splenectomised not--the activity decreased 30-50%, compared activity ghosts control persons. Reaction kinetic studies PK isolated red cell membranes normal individuals well 6 patients exhibited hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten kinetics Hill coefficients around 1.0.
