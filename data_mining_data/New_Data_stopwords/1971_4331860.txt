 1. Utilization propionate sheep liver mitochondria stimulated equally pyruvate alpha-oxoglutarate, formation predominantly malate. Pyruvate increased conversion propionate carbon citrate, whereas alpha-oxoglutarate increased formation phosphoenolpyruvate. fraction metabolized propionate converted phosphoenolpyruvate 17% presence absence alpha-oxoglutarate 7% presence pyruvate. Pyruvate consumption inhibited 80% 5mm-propionate. 2. Compared rat liver, sheep liver characterized high activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase moderately high activities aconitase mitochondria low activities ;malic' enzyme, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase cytosol. Activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy-kinase similar liver cytosol rats sheep. Activities malate dehydrogenase NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase sheep liver half rat liver. 3. phosphate-dicarboxylate antiport active sheep liver mitochondria, compared rat liver mitochondria citrate-malate antiport showed low activity mitochondrial aconitase relatively inaccessible external citrate. rate swelling mitochondria induced phosphate solutions ammonium malate inversely related concentration malate. 4. results discussed relation gluconeogenesis propionate sheep liver. proposed propionate converted malate mitochondria malate converted phosphoenolpyruvate enzymes cytosol. way sufficient NADH would generated cytosol convert phosphoenolpyruvate glucose.
