 BACKGROUND: contrast normal cells, cancer cells depend aerobic glycolysis energy production form adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bypassing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, compared normal cells, cancer cells exhibit higher consumption glucose higher production lactate. Again, higher rate glycolysis provides necessary glycolytic intermediary precursors DNA, protein lipid synthesis maintain high active proliferation tumor cells. scenario, classical control theory based approach may useful explore altered dynamics cancer cells. Since dynamics cancer cells different normal cells, understanding dynamics may lead development novel therapeutic strategies. METHOD: developed model based state space equations classical control theory along order reduction technique mimic actual dynamic behavior mammalian central carbon metabolic (CCM) pathway normal cells. Here, modified Michaelis Menten kinetic equation incorporate feedback mechanism along perturbations cross talks associated metabolic pathway. Furthermore, perturbed proposed model reduce mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Thereafter, connected proportional-integral (PI) controller(s) model tuning behave like CCM pathway cancer cell. methodology allows one track altered dynamics mediated different enzymes. RESULTS DISCUSSIONS: proposed model successfully mimics probable dynamics CCM pathway normal cells. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate cancer cells, coordination among enzymes catalyzing pentose phosphate pathway intermediate glycolytic enzymes along switching pyruvate kinase (M2 isoform) plays important role maintain altered dynamics.
