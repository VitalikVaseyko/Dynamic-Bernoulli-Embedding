 PURPOSE: Mitochondrial mutations identified head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), pathways phenotypic effects mutations exerted remain unclear. Previously, found mitochondrial ND2 mutations primary HNSCC increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) conferred aerobic, glycolytic phenotype HIF1alpha accumulation increased cell growth. purpose present study examine pathways relating alterations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mitochondrial mutant wild-type ND2 constructs transfected oral keratinocyte immortal cell line OKF6 head neck cancer cell line JHU-O19 established transfectants. protein levels HIF1alpha, pyruvate dehydrogenease (PDH), phosphorylated PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenease kinase 2 (PDK2), together ROS generation, compared mutant wild type. Meanwhile, effects small molecule inhibitors targeting PDK2 mitochondria-targeted catalase evaluated ND2 mutant transfectants. RESULTS: determined ND2 mutant down-regulated PDH expression via up-regulated PDK2, increase phosphorylated PDH. Inhibition PDK2 dichloroacetate decreased HIF1alpha accumulation reduced cell growth. Extracellular treatment hydrogen peroxide, ROS mimic, increased PDK2 expression HIF1alpha expression, introduction mitochondria-targeted catalase decreased mitochondrial mutation-mediated PDK2 HIF1alpha expression suppressed cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: findings suggest mitochondrial ND2 mutation contributes HIF1alpha accumulation via increased ROS production, up-regulation PDK2, attenuating PDH activity, thereby increasing pyruvate, resulting HIF1alpha stabilization. may provide insight potential mechanism, mitochondrial mutations contribute HNSCC development.
