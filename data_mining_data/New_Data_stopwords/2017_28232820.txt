 Influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) heterotrimer three viral proteins, PB1, PB2, PA involved transcription replication negative strand viral RNA (vRNA) genome. RdRp multifunctional, possessing RNA polymerase, cap binding, endonuclease activities. enzyme synthesizes three different RNAs, complementary RNA (cRNA) messenger RNA (mRNA) vRNA, vRNA cRNA. synthesize three RNAs, RdRp requires conversion function host factor. Here, performed yeast two-hybrid screening identify relevant host factor, revealing pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) interacted PA subunit influenza virus RdRp. PKM2 one two enzymes (PKM1 PKM2) produced alternative splicing pyruvate kinase (PKM) pre-mRNA. determined interacting regions PKM2 PA, expression level PKM western blotting different time points viral infection, effects transfection siRNA targeting PKM influenza virus replication. results demonstrated C-terminal region PKM2 interacted C-terminus PA subunit, expression level PKM2 increased influenza virus infection time, enzyme essential influenza virus multiplication. Moreover, isoelectric focusing uninfected influenza virus infected cell extracts, followed gradient gel electrophoresis separate PKM1 PKM2 isoforms western blotting indicated PKM2 became acidic influenza infection. decreased pH PKM2 may due phosphorylation, phosphorylated PKM2 active pyruvate kinase protein kinase; therefore, possible PKM2 may transfer phosphate group PA consequently transform function RdRp transcriptase replicase.
