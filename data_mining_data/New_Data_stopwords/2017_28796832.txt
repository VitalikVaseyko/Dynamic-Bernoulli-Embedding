 Bacterial histidine kinase/response regulator systems operate interface environmental cues physiological states. Escherichia coli contains two LytS/LytTR-type histidine kinase/response regulator systems, BtsS/BtsR (formerly YehU/YehT) YpdA/YpdB, identified pyruvate-responsive two-component systems. Since exhibit remarkable similarity, analyzed phylogenetic distribution within gamma-proteobacteria, experimentally characterized set representative species. found BtsS/BtsR predominant LytS/LytTR-type two-component system among gamma-proteobacteria, whereas YpdA/YpdB primarily appears supplementary role. Based observations E. coli, used highly conserved DNA-binding motifs test vivo functionality systems various genera, including Salmonella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Xenorhabdus, Yersinia, Aeromonas Vibrio. results suggest that, cases tested, BtsS/BtsR YpdA/YpdB respond different levels pyruvate environment.
