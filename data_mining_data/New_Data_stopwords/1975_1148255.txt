 Hexokinase (ATP:D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase EC 2.7.1.2) pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-0-phosphotransferase EC 2.7.1.40) co-immobilized within semipermeable collodion microcapsules. resulting microcapsules displayed excellent hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities, measured pyruvate kinase activity considerably greater measured hexokinase. co-immobilized enzymes, used sequentially capable recycling ATP ADP exposed appropriate conditions. Furthermore, exposed limiting amounts coenzyme, cycles capable reusing total amount coenzyme supplied least three times 90 min. use microencapsulation produce partially "self sufficient" enzyme systems discussed.
