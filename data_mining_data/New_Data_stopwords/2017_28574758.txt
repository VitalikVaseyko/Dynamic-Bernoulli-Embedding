 Mitochondrial dysfunction central defect cells creating Warburg reverse Warburg effect cancers. However, link mitochondrial dysfunction cancer yet clearly explained. Decrease mitochondrial oxidative energy production 50 % comparison healthy cells may caused inhibition pyruvate transfer mitochondrial matrix and/or disturbed H(+) ion transfer across inner mitochondrial membrane cytosol. Lowering inner membrane potential shifting working point mitochondria high values pH intermediate point causes reorganization ordered water layer mitochondrial membrane. reorganized ordered water layers high pH values release electrons transferred cytosol rim layer. electrons damp electromagnetic activity Warburg effect cancer cells fibroblasts associated reverse Warburg effect cancer cells leading lowered electromagnetic activity, disturbed coherence, increased frequency oscillations decreased level biological functions. reverse Warburg effect cancers, associated fibroblasts supply energy-rich metabolites cancer cell resulting increased power electromagnetic field, fluctuations due shift oscillations unstable nonlinear region, decreased frequency loss coherence.
