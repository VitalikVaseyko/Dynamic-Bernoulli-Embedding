 Conversion normal cells cancer accompanied changes metabolism. conversion, cell metabolism undergoes shift oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect, hallmark cancer cell metabolism. cancer cells, glycolysis functions parallel TCA cycle metabolic pathways enhance biosynthetic processes thus support proliferation growth. Similar metabolic features observed cells activation but, contrast cancer, metabolic transitions cells part physiological process. Currently, intense interest understanding cause effect relationship metabolic reprogramming cell differentiation. recent success cancer immunotherapy, crosstalk immune system cancer come forefront clinical basic research. One key goals delineate metabolic alterations cancer influence metabolism-regulated function differentiation tumor resident cells effects might altered immunotherapy. Here, review unique metabolic features cancer, implications cancer metabolism cell metabolic reprogramming antigen encounters, translational prospective harnessing metabolism cancer cells cancer therapy.
