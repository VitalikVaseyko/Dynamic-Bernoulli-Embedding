 1. mechanism rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase investigated measurements fluxes, isotope trapping, steady-state velocity binding substrates. measurements made pH8.5 Tris/HCl buffer 5mm-free Mg(2+). 2. Methods preparing [(32)P]phosphoenolpyruvate [(32)P]P(i) high yield determining [(32)P]-phosphoenolpyruvate [8-(14)C]ADP described. 3. ratio Flux ATP ADP/Flux ATP phosphoenolpyruvate (measured equilibrium) increased hyperbolically ADP concentration unity 2.1 2mm-ADP, unaffected phosphoenolpyruvate concentration. Since ratio greater unity, one pathway addition substrates must involve phosphoenolpyruvate adding first enzyme rate-limiting step. However, substrates must also add alternative order, non-linear increase ratio ADP concentration rate increase much less predicted steady-state velocity data ordered addition. lack influence phosphoenolpyruvate ratio consistent rapid addition ADP alternative pathway. low ADP concentrations alternative pathway contributes less 33% total reaction. 4. Isotope trapping observed [(32)P]phosphoenolpyruvate, confirming phosphoenolpyruvate adds first enzyme rate-limiting step. release phosphoenolpyruvate ternary complex must also slow step. Trapping observed [8-(14)C]ADP, hence addition ADP free enzyme must rapid unless dissociation constant large (>20mm). 5. Binding studies showed 4mol [(32)P]phosphoenolpyruvate binds 1mol enzyme, probably unligated Mg(2+), dissociation constant appropriate mechanism indicated above. Binding [8-(14)C]ADP could detected, hence binding ADP occurs low-affinity step. latter also demanded steady-state velocity data. 6. ratio Flux phosphoenolpyruvate ATP/Flux phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate (determined incorporation label phosphoenolpyruvate [3-(14)C]-pyruvate [gamma-(32)P]ATP forward reaction) differ significantly unity. Steady-state velocity data predicted grossly different flux ratios ordered dissociations products, results indicate dissociation must rapid random. data also exclude Ping-Pong mechanism. 7. Permissible rate constants mechanism calculated. results indicate high degree cooperativity binding, whatever order addition substrate.
