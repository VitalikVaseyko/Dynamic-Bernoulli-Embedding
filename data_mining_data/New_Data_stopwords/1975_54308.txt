 effect intravenous oral administration magnesium containing drug (Magnesium Diasporal, Protina, Munchen) erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) activity two cases congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia associated PK deficiency examined. Intravenous injection drug followed transient increase magnesium content. Positive correlation erythrocyte magnesium ions concentration PK activity found. authors propose hypothesis observed correlation may due erythrocyte accumulation PK activators elimination PK inhibitors. authors not, however, succeed maintain high erythrocyte magnesium concentration inducing increase PK activity longer period time.
