 INTRODUCTION: dimeric form pyruvate kinase type M2 overexpressed tumor cells (TuM2-PK). aim present study evaluate clinical value TuM2-PK tumor marker renal cell carcinoma (RCC), transitional cell carcinoma bladder (TCC) prostate cancer (PCA) using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection TuM2-PK plasma. MATERIAL METHODS: TuM2-PK concentration EDTA plasma determined quantitatively immunologically using ELISA (ScheBoTech, Germany). measured TuM2-PK plasma levels 83 patients RCC, 30 patients TCC 30 patients PCA therapy. 100 patients various non-malignant urological disorders recruited control group. RESULTS: patients RCC showed significantly elevated plasma levels TuM2-PK compared control group (p < 0.01). found sensitivity 42.6% specificity 80.4% using cut-off value 15 U/ml (manufacturer's recommendation). follow-up, 50% showed increasing plasma levels TuM2-PK case metastases. Significant differences could detected either TCC PCA. CONCLUSIONS: data suggest TuM2-PK useful marker TCC PCA. Due low sensitivity specificity, TuM2-PK suitable diagnosis RCC. Whether TuM2-PK may useful advanced RCC control success palliative treatment regimens still unclear.
