 Sporolactobacillus inulinus superior D-lactic acid-producing bacterium proposed species industrial production. major pathway D-lactic acid biosynthesis, glycolysis, mainly regulated via two irreversible steps catalyzed allosteric enzymes, phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase. activity level PFK significantly consistent cell growth D-lactic acid production, indicating vital role control regulation glycolysis. study, ATP-dependent PFK S. inulinus expressed Escherichia coli purified homogeneity. PFK allosterically activated GDP ADP inhibited phosphoenolpyruvate; addition activators could partly relieve inhibition phosphoenolpyruvate. Furthermore, monovalent cations could enhance activity, Na(+) efficient one. Considering kind activation, NaOH investigated neutralizer instead traditional neutralizer CaCO3. early growth stage, significant accelerated glucose consumption achieved NaOH case probably enhanced activity Na(+)-activated PFK. Using NaOH neutralizer pH 6.5, fermentation time greatly shortened 22 h; simultaneously, glucose consumption rate D-lactic acid productivity increased 34 17%, respectively. probably contributed increased pH Na(+)-promoted activity PFK. Thus, fermentations S. inulinus using NaOH neutralizer provide green highly efficient D-lactic acid production easy subsequent purification.
