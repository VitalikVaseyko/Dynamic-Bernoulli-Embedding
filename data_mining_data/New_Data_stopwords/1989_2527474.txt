 glycolytic enzymes glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) assessed liver, heart, red muscle, white muscle aerobic 5-h anoxic turtles (Pseudemys scripta) changes total activity kinetic parameters. Anoxia induced statistically significant changes glycolytic enzymes four organs assayed. Compared normoxic controls, anoxic liver showed 3.3-fold increase glycogen phosphorylase activity, 1.5-fold increase PFK I50 value citrate (concentration inhibits initial activity 50%), 1.5-fold increase PFK Michaelis constant (Km) value fructose 6-phosphate (P), increased maximal activity PK. Anoxic heart muscle showed 2.6-fold decrease glycogen phosphorylase activity and, PFK, 1.7-fold decrease Km value ATP twofold increase I50 value citrate. anoxic white muscle, PFK showed fivefold lower Km value fructose-6-P threefold lower activator concentration producing half-maximal activation (A50) potassium phosphate aerobic enzyme form. Changes anoxic white muscle PK included twofold increase Km value ADP 1.7-fold decrease I50 value alanine. red muscle, anoxia affected Km value ATP, 50% higher value aerobic enzyme form. Fructose 2,6-diphosphate (P2) levels also decreased heart muscle increased red white muscle anoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
