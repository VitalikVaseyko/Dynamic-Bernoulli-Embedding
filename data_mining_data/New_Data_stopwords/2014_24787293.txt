 Metabolic synergy metabolic coupling glycolytic stromal cells (Warburg effect) oxidative cancer cells occurs human breast cancers promotes tumor growth. Warburg effect aerobic glycolysis catabolism glucose lactate obtain adenosine triphosphate (ATP). review summarizes main findings stromal metabolic phenotype, associated signaling pathways, well critical role oxidative stress autophagy, promote carcinoma cell mitochondrial metabolism tumor growth. Loss Caveolin 1 (Cav-1) upregulation monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) stromal cells novel markers Warburg effect metabolic synergy stromal carcinoma cells. MCT4 Cav-1 also breast cancer prognostic biomarkers. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) key mediators stromal Warburg effect. High ROS also favors cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism tumorigenesis, anti-oxidants reverse altered stromal carcinoma metabolism. pseudo-hypoxic state glycolysis low mitochondrial metabolism absence hypoxia common feature breast cancer. High ROS induces loss Cav-1 stromal cells sufficient generate pseudo-hypoxic state. Loss Cav-1 stroma drives glycolysis lactate extrusion via HIF-1alpha stabilization upregulation MCT4. Stromal cells loss Cav-1 and/or high expression MCT4 also show catabolic phenotype, enhanced macroautophagy. catabolic state stromal cells driven hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), JNK activation high ROS generation. feed-forward loop stromal cells regulates pseudo-hypoxia metabolic synergy, Cav-1, MCT4, HIF-1alpha, NFkappaB, ROS key elements. Metabolic synergy also may occur cancer cells cells distant organs tumor. Cancer cachexia, due severe organismal metabolic dysregulation myocytes adipocytes, shares similarities stromal-carcinoma metabolic synergy, well. summary, metabolic synergy occurs breast carcinoma cells induce nutrient-rich microenvironment promote tumor growth. process tumor metabolic synergy multistep process, due generation ROS, induction catabolism autophagy, mitophagy glycolysis. Studying epithelial-stromal interactions metabolic synergy important better understand ecology cancer metabolic role different cell types tumor progression.
