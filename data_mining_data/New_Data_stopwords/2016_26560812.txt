 Vascular calcification, pathologic response defective calcium phosphate homeostasis, strongly associated cardiovascular mortality morbidity. study, observed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex phosphorylation increased calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) calcified vessels patients atherosclerosis, suggesting PDK4 plays important role vascular calcification. genetic pharmacological inhibition PDK4 ameliorated calcification phosphate-treated VSMCs aortic rings vitamin D3-treated mice. PDK4 augmented osteogenic differentiation VSMCs phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8 via direct interaction, enhances BMP2 signaling. Furthermore, increased expression PDK4 phosphate-treated VSMCs induced mitochondrial dysfunction followed apoptosis. Taken together, results show upregulation PDK4 promotes vascular calcification increasing osteogenic markers adverse effect bone formation, demonstrating PDK4 therapeutic target vascular calcification.
