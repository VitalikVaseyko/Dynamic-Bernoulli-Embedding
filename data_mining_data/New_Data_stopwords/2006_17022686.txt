 prior work shown pyk mutant Bacillus subtilis exhibited diminished acidic byproduct accumulation, dramatically elevated phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pool, reduced growth rate. determine low acetate-producing fast-growing strain B. subtilis could developed, placed expression pyk gene control inducible promoter. Enzyme measurements proved PYK activity inducible PYK mutant (iPYK) increases isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside concentration. Batch growth experiments showed growth rate acid formation closely related induction level pyk. Measurements cell growth rate acetate formation iPYK mutant different induction levels revealed PYK activity 12% wild-type allows good growth rate (0.4 h(-)(1) versus 0.63 h(-)(1) wild-type) low acetate production (0.26 g/L versus 1.05 g/L wild-type). first report knowledge metabolically engineered B. subtilis strain allows good growth rate low acid production batch cultures. Finally, found that, varying pyk induction level, intracellular PEP concentration controlled wide range. intracellular PEP concentration intimately connected regulation transport phosphotransferase system (PTS) sugars presence glucose. method modulating intracellular PEP levels, finding represents major advance one's ability dissect function PTS sugar metabolism bacteria.
