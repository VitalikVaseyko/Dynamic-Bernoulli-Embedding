 Enzyme assays involving coupled pyruvate kinase (PK) used many years monitor activity major classes enzymes including glycosyltransferases. Numerous potent inhibitors discovered kinetically characterized thanks technology. However, inhibitors important enzymes screened, PK inhibitors activators often observed. study report solutions resolve problems encountered either screening kinetic characterization glycosyltransferase inhibitors means PK-coupled assays. enzyme study-WaaC-is important glycosyltransferase involved bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis pathway. Firstly showed alternative kinases nucleoside 5-diphosphate kinase (NDPK), myokinase (MK), ADPdependent hexokinase catalyze similar reactions PK prone troubles. Moreover, ADP chemosensor used alternative sensitivity sufficient allow proper screening. Finally, found stepwise PK/luciferase assay resolved problems encountered PK inhibitors WaaC HPLC assay allowed identification WaaC inhibitors acting PK activators, thus allowing false positive false negative results linked coupling PK eliminated.
