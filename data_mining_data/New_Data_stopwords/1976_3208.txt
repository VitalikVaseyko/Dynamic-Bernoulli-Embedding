 Chicken embryos less 15 days old contain K isozyme pyruvate kinase, appears exist vivo R,T conformational set pI values 7.2 6.6, respectively. Sets lower pI higher pI K-isozyme variants also obtained. Whole embryos 15 days development show progressively increasing amounts higher pI, lower K0.5S enzymatic variants. Tissue distribution kinetic properties suggest highest pI form (pH 8.8-9.0) M-isozyme analogue. intermediate forms postulated hybrids. Adult liver extracts contain embryonic K isozyme; evidence L-isozyme analogue obtained. major forms enzymes compared respect saturation phosphoenolpyruvate absence effector presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate, alanine, serine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and/or Mg-ATP.
