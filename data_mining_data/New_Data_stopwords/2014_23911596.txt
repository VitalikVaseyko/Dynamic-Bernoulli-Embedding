 BACKGROUND: shift glucose metabolism oxidative phosphorylation anaerobic glycolysis biochemical hallmark malignant cancer cells. METHODS: present study, demonstrated Nodal stimulated expression glycolytic enzymes decreased reliance mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation human glioma cancer cells. shift glucose metabolism mediated induction hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). RESULTS: Nodal protein expression shown correlated expression levels glucose transporter (Glut)-1, hexokinase (HK)-II, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-1, phosphorylation level pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), glucose uptake, lactate accumulation human glioma cells. effects inversely correlated mitochondrial oxygen consumption ATP production. Knockdown Nodal expression specific small hairpin RNA reduced Glut-1, HK-II, PDK-1 expressions PDH phosphorylation. Nodal knockdown also reduced glucose uptake lactate generation, turn increased mitochondrial membrane potential (Psi), O2 utilization, ATP synthesis. ectopic expression Nodal low-expressing Nodal glioma cells resulted opposite results compared Nodal knockdown glioma cells. Treatment cells recombinant Nodal increased HIF-1 expression, effect regulated transcriptional level. Blockage Nodal receptor pharmacological inhibitor Nodal knockdown U87MG cells decreased HIF-1alpha expression. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha knockdown U87MG cells decreased Glut-1, HK-II, PDK-1 expressions PDH phosphorylation, similar results Nodal knockdown cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, results suggest Nodal affects energy metabolism HIF-1alpha.
