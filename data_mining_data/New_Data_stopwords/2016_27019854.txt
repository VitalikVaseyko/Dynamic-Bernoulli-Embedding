 Medicinal plants effective controlling plasma glucose level minimal side effects commonly used developing countries alternative therapy treatment type 1 diabetes mellitus. aim study evaluate potential antidiabetic antioxidant impacts Balanites aegyptiaca Petroselinum sativum extracts streptozotocin-induced diabetic normal rats. influences extracts body weight, plasma glucose, insulin, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, liver-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) levels assessed. Furthermore, weight histomorphological changes pancreas studied different experimental groups. herbal preparations significantly reduced mean plasma glucose MDA levels significantly increased mean plasma insulin, L-PK, TAC levels treated diabetic groups compared diabetic control group. obvious increase weight pancreas size islets Langerhans improvement histoarchitecture evident treated groups compared untreated ones. conclusion, present study provides scientific evidence traditional use extracts antidiabetic antioxidant agents type 1 diabetes mellitus.
