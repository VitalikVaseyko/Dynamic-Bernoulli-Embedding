 Three cell lines established human gliomas found differ capacity phosphorylate glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase vitro. Phosphorylation glioblastoma cell line U-138 pronounced glioma cell line Hs 683 glioblastoma cell line A-172. 3 cell lines showed similar pyruvate kinase isozyme patterns expressed 90% K-type 10% M-type subunits. So, differences pyruvate kinase phosphorylation could explained differences availability appropriate substrate, pyruvate kinase type K. gliomas, phosphorylation could specifically almost completely inhibited fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. order investigate potential physiological significance phosphorylation pyruvate kinase, characterized cell lines several glycolytic parameters. U-138 cells, production lactate appeared 2 times higher compared A-172 Hs 683 cells normal growth conditions even 4 times higher low glucose culture regime. efflux lactate correlated pyruvate kinase phosphorylation pattern cell lines. none cell lines could lactate production stimulated glutamine additional energy source low glucose culture conditions. higher glycolytic flux U-138 cells accompanied higher glycolytic enzyme activities. isozyme patterns hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, aldolase, enolase lactate dehydrogenase cell lines nearly identical resembled patterns previously described solid gliomas. However, isozyme composition phosphofructokinase cell lines differed situation gliomas. gliomas expression L-type phosphofructokinase favored, glioma cell lines, found increase expression C-type subunits.
