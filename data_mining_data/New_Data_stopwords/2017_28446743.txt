 BACKGROUND Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays important role cancer tumorigenesis. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) induced EMT, could increase tumor migration invasion. Moreover, recent studies proven mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) critical regulator EMT. investigated mechanisms mTOR transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced EMT cervical cancer cells. MATERIAL METHODS HeLa SiHa cells treated 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1 induce EMT. Then, treated without rapamycin. CCK8 assay performed determine cell proliferation. Cell migration detected wound-healing assay; apoptosis analyzed flow cytometry; mTOR inhibitors inhibited mTOR pathway assess expression E-cadherin, Vimentin STAT3, Snail2, p-p70s6k, PKM2 expression. RESULTS TGF-beta1 promoted proliferation migration, attenuated apoptosis cervical carcinoma cells. Rapamycin abolished TGF-beta1-induced EMT cell proliferation migration reversed TGF-beta1-induced EMT. E-cadherin suppressed, whereas Vimentin PKM2 increased HeLa SiHa cells stimulation TGF-beta1. Moreover, mTOR activated process TGF-beta1-induced EMT. Rapamycin inhibited phosphorylation p70s6k. Furthermore, inhibition mTOR pathway decreased PKM2 expression. CONCLUSIONS Inhibition mTOR pathway abolished TGF-beta1-induced EMT reduced mTOR/p70s6k signaling, downregulated PKM2 expression. results provide novel mechanistic insight anti-tumor effects inhibition mTOR.
