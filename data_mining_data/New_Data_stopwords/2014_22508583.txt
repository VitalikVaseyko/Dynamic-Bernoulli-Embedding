 Oxidative stress diabetic tissues accompanied high-level free radicals simultaneously declined antioxidant enzymes status leading cell membrane damage. present study carried observe effect sodium orthovanadate (SOV) Trigonella foenum graecum seed powder (TSP) administration blood glucose insulin levels, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase protein kinase C heart, muscle brain alloxan-induced diabetic rats see whether treatment SOV TSP capable reversing diabetic effects. Diabetes induced administration alloxan monohydrate (15 mg/100 g body weight), rats treated 2 IU insulin, 0.6 mg/ml SOV, 5% TSP diet combination 0.2 mg/ml SOV 5% TSP separately 21 days. Blood glucose levels increased markedly diabetic rats, animals treated combined dose SOV TSP glucose levels almost comparable controls, similar results obtained activities pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, antioxidant enzymes protein kinase C diabetic animals. results showed lower doses SOV (0.2 mg/ml) could used combination TSP effectively reverse diabetic alterations experimental diabetes.
