 Highly purified branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC) oxidizes 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate 2-oxobutyrate, Km values 67 microM 18 microM respectively. Vmax. oxidation substrates 27% 53% respectively 3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate. Highly purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) oxidizes 2-oxobutyrate (Km 100 microM; Vmax. 49% pyruvate) 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate, whereas 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex utilize either 2-oxo acid substrate. BCOADC kinase inhibited 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate 2-oxobutyrate, half-maximal inhibition 45 microM 50 microM respectively. Phosphorylation BCOADC isolated adipocytes inhibited 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate 2-oxobutyrate, consistent inhibitory action BCOADC kinase. Phosphorylation PDC decreased 2-oxobutyrate, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate.
