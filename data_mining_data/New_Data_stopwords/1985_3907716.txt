 effects amiloride natural aliphatic polyamines basal hormone-stimulated protein phosphorylations hepatocytes studied. Cells isolated adult rats incubated suspension (32P)-orthophosphate, absence presence effectors varying concentrations different times; hepatocytes exposed various hormones 10 min. Phosphoproteins contained total cell lysates analyzed one- two-dimensional gel electrophoresis autoradiography. Amiloride spermine (the effective amine) decreased basal level phosphorylation proteins 46, 34 22 kDal, increased 18 kDal 93 kDal proteins. effects maximal external concentrations 1 mM 7.5-10 mM amiloride spermine, respectively. detectable lag period 10 min reached plateau 45 min. Pretreatment cells effectors almost completely prevented stimulation phosphorylation 46 34 kDal proteins insulin. contrast, effects vasopressin proteins partly inhibited, whereas glucagon appeared largely unaffected. major effect observed intact cells (i.e., decreased phosphorylation) could reproduced cell-free system kinase activity persisted. Amiloride spermine added directly cell extracts strongly accelerated dephosphorylation 46 kDal protein also 61 kDal protein identified pyruvate kinase. Furthermore, restoration activity enzyme occurred concomitantly dephosphorylation 61 kDal protein, observation supporting notion amiloride spermine could activate phosphoprotein phosphatase.
