 circumsporozoite protein-specific monoclonal antibody (N2H6D5) injected malaria-infected mosquitoes determine effect sporogonic cycle. injection antibody mosquitoes (100 ng each), positive immunofluorescence (measured air-dried sporozoites) reactions hemolymph extracts observed dilution 1:1000. 72 hr postinjection levels dropped 1:10. Sporozoites coinjected antibody invade salivary glands. naturally infected mosquitoes, sporozoites released period 3 4 days. Therefore, mosquitoes injected twice. first injection day beginning sporozoite release second, 2 days later. Sporozoite invasion salivary glands assessed 3 days second injection, microscopic examination dissected glands. stage, oocysts completed maturation released sporozoites. Salivary gland infections totally prevented mosquitoes given two injections 100 ng N2H6D5. Hence, sustained presence anti-circumsporozoite antibodies hemolymph render female Aedes aegypti refractory Plasmodium gallinaceum.
