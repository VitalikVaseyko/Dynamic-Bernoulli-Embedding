 demand hepatic glucose production increases exercise, regulation liver substrate choice gluconeogenic activity becomes essential. aim present study investigate effect single exercise bout gluconeogenic protein content regulation enzymes involved substrate utilization liver. Mice subjected 1 h treadmill exercise, livers removed immediately, 4 10 h exercise. Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK) mRNA contents liver increased immediately exercise, PEPCK protein content increased 10 h recovery. Furthermore, 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E1alpha Ser(293) phosphorylations decreased immediately exercise. addition, PDH kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA protein content increased immediately exercise 10 h recovery, respectively. findings suggest acute changes PEPCK G6Pase protein contents contribute regulation gluconeogenic enzyme activity 1 h non-exhaustive exercise. addition, observation PDH-E1alpha, AMPK, ACC phosphorylation decreased immediately exercise may indicate carbohydrates rather fatty acids utilized oxidation liver non-exhaustive exercise.
