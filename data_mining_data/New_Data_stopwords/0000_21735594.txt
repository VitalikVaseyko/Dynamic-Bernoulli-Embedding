 expression human pyruvate kinase M2 (hPK-M2) cancer cells appears critical tumor cell growth proliferation vivo. PK-M2 isoform expressed cancer cells studied, represents target drug development could potentially enable tumor cells return normal state metabolism. novel strategy targeting malignancy successful, would applicable diverse types cancer. probes ML203 (CID-44543605), ML202 (CID-44246498), ML170 (CID-4547230) members series highly specific allosteric activators tumor-specific isoform human pyruvate kinase (M2 isoform). three probes affect cooperativity phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding, little affect adenosine diphosphate (ADP) binding, manner similar Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP).
