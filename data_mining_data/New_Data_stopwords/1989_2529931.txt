 Adult dogs phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency compensated hemolytic anemia, due absolute functional deficiency muscle-type (M-type) subunit normally accounts majority total erythrocyte PFK activity dogs. Potential effects PFK deficiency hematologic development evaluated dogs. Routine hematologic parameters similar normal affected dogs 1 day old, newborn dogs erythrocyte PFK activities three times normal adult dogs. Based chromatographic separation PFK isozymes enzyme immunoprecipitation studies, high PFK activity birth attributed predominance liver-type (L-type) subunit PFK, negligible absent normal adult dog erythrocytes. total PFK activities amounts L-type subunit present decreased dramatically first 6 8 weeks life. muscle-type subunit negligible absent birth, appeared increased L-type decreased normal dogs. changes may result replacement erythrocytes formed fetus formed birth. postnatal physiologic anemia developed similar degree affected normal dogs decreases mean corpuscular volume erythrocyte numbers. Reticulocyte counts high dogs birth remained high affected dogs, decreased 2 months age onward normal dogs. Erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) values low newborn pups increased values expected adults respective groups 2 4 weeks age. low 2,3-DPG concentration occurs affected dogs PFK deficiency inhibits glycolysis side shunt forms 2,3-DPG.
