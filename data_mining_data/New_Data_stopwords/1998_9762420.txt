 isozymes three glycolytic regulatory kinases: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase fractionated single ion exchange chromatographic procedure DEAE-cellulose. Enriched-erythroblast bone marrow cells showed two heterogeneous peaks, consisting two overlapping peaks: one major one minor peak, two isozymes observed reticulocytes erythrocytes. Phosphofructokinase showed multiple isozymic forms three cell populations, erythroblasts main one eluted last fractions, reticulocytes erythrocytes eluted early fractions. Pyruvate kinase showed main early activity peak shoulder erythroblasts, reticulocytes erythrocytes response allosteric effectors (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate ATP) suggests presence different pyruvate kinase isozymes reticulocytes erythrocytes.
