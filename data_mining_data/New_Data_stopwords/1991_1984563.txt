 previously shown normal Wistar rats fed 3 weeks isocaloric sucrose-rich (63%) diet (SRD) develop high levels plasma free fatty acids increased triacylglycerol content myocardium. reporting changes accompanied remarkably low levels active form pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHa; mean +/- SEM, 37.2% +/- 3.7% total activity) compared levels found hearts donated control rats fed standard chow diet (STD; 71.0% +/- 2.8%; P less .01). Increased concentrations long-chain acyl-CoA (0.21 +/- 0.03 v 0.06 +/- 0.01 mumol.g dry weight-1 found STD; P less .01) acetyl-CoA (0.17 +/- 0.05 v 0.09 +/- 0.01 found STD; P less .01), well relative decrease coenzyme (CoASH) (0.21 +/- 0.02 v 0.32 +/- 0.05 STD; P = NS), resulting increased acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio (0.80 +/- 0.13 v 0.29 +/- 0.03 STD; P less .01) may stimulated PDH kinase, leading turn inactivation PDH complex. enzymatic metabolic changes situ heart SRD-fed rats still present perfusing 35 minutes Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 11 mmol/L glucose exogenous substrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
