 increasing importance hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) tumorigenesis raises possibility agents specifically inhibit transcription factor, would provide significant therapeutic benefit. constitutive expression HIF-1alpha 35% Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients suggests HIF-1alpha suppression might part therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, explored effect EZN-2968, small 3rd generation antisense oligonucleotide HIF-1alpha, panel MM cell lines primary patients samples. Here, demonstrated EZN-2968 highly specific HIF-1alpha mRNA exposure MM cells EZN-2968 resulted efficient homogeneous loading cells showing long lasting low HIF-1alpha protein level. MM cells, HIF-1alpha suppression induced permanent cell cycle arrest prolonging S-phase cyclin modulation addition induced mild apoptotic cell death. Moreover, HIF-1alpha suppression caused metabolic shift leaded increased production ATP oxidative phosphorylation (i.e. Warburg effect reversion), confirmed observed mitochondrial membrane potential decrease. results show HIF-1alpha important player MM homeostasis inhibition small antisense oligonucleotides provides rationale novel therapeutic strategy improving MM treatment.
