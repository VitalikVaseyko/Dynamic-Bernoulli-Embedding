 Catalysis beef heart submitochondrial particles medium Pi equilibrium HOH, Pi equilibrium ATP, ATP equilibrium HOH exchanges strongly inhibited ATPase intermediate Pi equilibrium HOH exchange accelerated medium ADP removed pyruvate kinase action. Arsenate readily blocks completely Pi equilibrium ATP medium Pi equilibrium HOH exchange reactions, ATP equilibrium HOH exchange reaction. residual ATP equilibrium HOH exchange presence arsenate inhibited 2,4-dinitrophenol. results data explained alternating site model oxidative phosphorylation. model net oxidative phosphorylation ATP formed one site transitorily tightly bound released ADP Pi bind second site membrane ATPase complex energized. conditions net ATP hydrolysis, ATP binding one site accompanied hydrolysis transitorily tightly bound ATP second site. Attractive features one site input conformational energization membrane ATPase, single conformational transition accounts promotion ADP Pi binding competent mode release tightly bound ATP, symmetry catalytic sites. Pi equilibrium ATP exchange inhibited increase MgADP MgATP constant ratios, energy-linked ADP equilibrium ATP exchange inhibited increased concentrations MgATP Pi constant ratio. exchange patterns indicate random binding release ADP Pi.
