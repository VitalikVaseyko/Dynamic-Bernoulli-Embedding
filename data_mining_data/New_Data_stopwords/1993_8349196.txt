 BACKGROUND METHODS: clinical biochemical aspects two cases PK deficiency associated chronic hemolytic anemia two unrelated patients reported. residual erythrocyte PK enzymes patients characterized recommended methods International Committee Standardization Hematology (ICSH). RESULTS CONCLUSIONS: Patient (W.Q.) 60% residual PK activity may considered homozygous basis consanguinity family. patient suffered moderate hemolytic anemia improved splenectomy. enzymatic properties were: low activity, moderate thermal stability, reduced affinity phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP), normal electrophoretic mobility. Patient (E.O.) 42% residual PK activity may considered compound heterozygous since parents related. suffered moderate hemolytic anemia. enzymatic properties were: low activity, moderate thermal stability, reduced affinity PEP minimal retardation electrophoretic migration. Theses two cases PK deficiency first discovered Jordan probably first Arab country.
