 comprehensive approach (13)C tracer studies, labeling measurements gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, metabolite balancing, isotopomer modeling, applied comparative metabolic network analysis lysine-producing Corynebacterium glutamicum glucose fructose. Significantly reduced yields lysine biomass enhanced formation dihydroxyacetone, glycerol, lactate comparison glucose resulted fructose. Metabolic flux analysis revealed drastic differences intracellular flux depending carbon source applied. fructose, flux pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) 14.4% total substrate uptake flux therefore markedly decreased compared glucose (62.0%). result due mainly (i) predominance phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems fructose uptake (PTS(Fructose)) (92.3%), resulting major entry fructose via fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, (ii) inactivity fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (0.0%). uptake fructose flux via PTS(Mannose) 7.7%. glucose-grown cells, flux pyruvate dehydrogenase (70.9%) much less fructose-grown cells (95.2%). Accordingly, flux tricarboxylic acid cycle decreased glucose. Normalized glucose uptake, supply NADPH flux 112.4% fructose compared 176.9% glucose, might explain substantially lower lysine yield C. glutamicum fructose. Balancing NADPH levels even revealed apparent deficiency NADPH fructose, probably overcome vivo activity malic enzyme. Based results, potential targets could identified optimization lysine production C. glutamicum fructose, involving (i) modification flux two PTS fructose uptake, (ii) amplification fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase increase flux PPP, (iii) knockout not-yet-annotated gene encoding dihydroxyacetone phosphatase kinase activity suppress overflow metabolism. Statistical evaluation revealed high precision estimates flux, observed differences metabolic flux clearly substrate specific.
