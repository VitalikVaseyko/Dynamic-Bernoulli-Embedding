 Serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP) interacts transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptors inhibits TGF-beta signaling. Here, identify STRAP interacting partner ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1). association ASK1 STRAP mediated C-terminal domain ASK1 fourth sixth WD40 repeats STRAP. Using cysteine-to-serine amino acid substitution mutants ASK1 (C1005S, C1351S, C1360S, C1351S/C1360S) STRAP (C152S, C270S, C152S/C270S), demonstrated Cys(1351) Cys(1360) ASK1 Cys(152) Cys(270) STRAP required ASK1-STRAP binding. ASK1 phosphorylated STRAP Thr(175) Ser(179), suggesting potential role STRAP phosphorylation ASK1 activity regulation. Expression wild-type STRAP, STRAP mutants (C152S/C270S T175A/S179A), inhibited ASK1-mediated signaling JNK p38 kinases stabilizing complex formation ASK1 negative regulators, thioredoxin 14-3-3, decreasing complex formation ASK1 substrate MKK3. addition, STRAP suppressed H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis dose-dependent manner inhibiting ASK1 activity direct interaction. results suggest STRAP act negative regulator ASK1.
