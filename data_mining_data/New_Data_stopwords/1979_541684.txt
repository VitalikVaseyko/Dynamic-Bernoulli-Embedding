 Purified pyruvate kinase prepared pooled brains obtained untreated rats. properties suggest similar type 'M' pyruvate kinase. Lithium inhibition demonstrated pharmacologically significant lithium concentrations (7%-12% 2 mmol 1-1 Li) similar character previously seen rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, namely noncompetitive respect phosphoenol pyruvate, K+, Mg2+ competitive ADP.
