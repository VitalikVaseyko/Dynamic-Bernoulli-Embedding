 4-Hydroxypentanoic acid alanine thioether synthesized characterized n.m.r. spectroscopy. derivative corresponded modified amino acid obtained allowing 5-chloro-4-oxo[3,5-3H]pentanoic acid react rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. Performic acid oxidation 4-oxo[3,5-3H]pentanoic acid alanine thioether pyruvate kinase gave [3H]succinate (67%) [3H]carboxymethylcysteine (33%) expected. Evidence presented show NaBH4 reduction followed periodate oxidation analysis radioactive formaldehyde production may provide convenient method distinguishing thiol amino alkylation halogenomethyl ketone compounds. Peptide 'mapping' confirms modification 5-chloro-4-oxopentanoic acid occurs primarily one region pyruvate kinase.
