 IkappaBalpha inhibits transcriptional activity NF-kappaB cytoplasm preventing nuclear translocation NF-kappaB nucleus dissociates NF-kappaB DNA transports back cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic localization inactive NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha complexes controlled mutual masking nuclear import sequences NF-kappaB p65 IkappaBalpha active CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Here, describe additional mechanism accounting cytoplasmic anchoring IkappaBalpha NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha complexes. N-terminal domain IkappaBalpha contains sequence responsible cytoplasmic retention IkappaBalpha specifically recognized G3BP2, cytoplasmic protein interacts IkappaBalpha IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB complexes. G3BP2 composed N-terminal domain homologous NTF2 protein, followed acidic domain sufficient interaction IkappaBalpha cytoplasmic retention sequence, region containing five PXXP motifs C-terminal domain containing RNA-binding motifs. Overexpression G3BP2 directly promotes retention IkappaBalpha cytoplasm, indicating subcellular distribution IkappaBalpha NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha complexes likely results equilibrium nuclear import, nuclear export, cytoplasmic retention. molecular organization G3BP2 suggests putative scaffold protein might connect NF-kappaB signal transduction cascade cellular functions nuclear transport RNA metabolism.
