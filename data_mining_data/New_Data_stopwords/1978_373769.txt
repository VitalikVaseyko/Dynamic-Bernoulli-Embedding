 animals pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction mainly responsible irreversible loss glucose carbon oxidation. Regulation reaction shown major determinant glucose conservation starvation diabetes. Estimates conservation man starvation diabetes reviewed. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex inhibited products reactions; also regulated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle catalysed kinase intrinsic complex loosely associated phosphatase. Inactivation largely accomplished phosphorylation tetrameric decarboxylase component (alpha2beta2) alpha2Pbeta2. Complete phosphorylation produces (alpha2P3)beta2 form. forms completely reactivated phosphatase action initial rate reactivation complex containing alpha2Pbeta2 approximately three times (alpha2P3)beta2. proportion active (dephosphorylated) complex decreased rat tissues starvation diabetes perfused rat heart oxidation fatty acids ketone bodies. adipose tissue vitro, insulin increases proportion active complex lipolytic hormones may decrease proportion. suggested rates oxidation lipid fuels may major determinant activity pyruvate dehydrogenase tissues relation actions insulin lipolytic hormones effects diabetes starvation. Phosphorylation inactivation complex enhanced high mitochondrial ratios [acetyl-CoA]/[CoA], [ATP]/[ADP], [NADH]/[NAD+] low concentrations pyruvate, Mg2+ Ca2+, vice versa.
