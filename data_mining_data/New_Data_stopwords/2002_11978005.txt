 Hyaluronan, high-molecular-weight glycosaminoglycan extracellular matrix, prominent rapid tissue growth repair. stimulates cell motility hydrates tissue, providing environment facilitates cell movement. Markedly enhanced levels hyaluronan also occur stroma surrounding human cancers, thus providing environment promotes spread cancer cells. ability malignant tumors generate lactate, even presence adequate oxygen, known Warburg effect. Early wound healing blood oxygen supply decrease, lactate levels increase, stromal hyaluronan, suggesting cause-and-effect relationship. Similarly, peritumor stromal fibroblast hyaluronan may response cancer cell lactate. test this, fibroblasts cultured presence lactate. increasing lactate, higher levels hyaluronan observed, levels CD44 expression, predominant receptor hyaluronan. ability tumor cells utilize anaerobic metabolism generate lactate, even presence adequate supplies oxygen, may one mechanisms used recruit host fibroblasts deposit hyaluronan express CD44, thereby participating process cancer invasion metastasis.
