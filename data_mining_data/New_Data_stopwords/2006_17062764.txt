 AIM: aim report study effect high-fat (HF)/low-carbohydrate (CHO) diet regulation substrate metabolism humans. METHODS: Ten healthy men consumed either HF (75% energy fat) control (35%) diet 6 random order. 7, blood glucose disappearance rate (Rd) determined hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Substrate oxidation determined indirect calorimetry. Muscle biopsies obtained prediet, postdiet, postclamps. RESULTS: Rd similar basal conditions slightly elevated (approximately 10%, P < 0.05) last 30 min clamp HF diet. HF diet reduced CHO oxidation basal (by approximately 40%, P < 0.05) clamp conditions (by approximately 20%, P < 0.05), increased insulin-mediated whole-body nonoxidative glucose disposal (by 30%, P < 0.05) muscle glycogen storage (by approximately 25%, P < 0.05). Muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity blunted basal clamp conditions HF compared control (P < 0.05) accompanied approximately 2-fold increase (P < 0.05) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA protein expression. CONCLUSION: Short-term HF/low-CHO dietary intake induce whole-body insulin resistance, caused shift im glucose metabolism oxidation glycogen storage. Insulin-stimulated CHO oxidation muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity blunted HF diet. Up-regulation muscle PDK4 expression early molecular adaptation changes, showed first time healthy humans, unlike insulin-resistant individuals, insulin suppress PDK4 PDK2 gene expression skeletal muscle.
