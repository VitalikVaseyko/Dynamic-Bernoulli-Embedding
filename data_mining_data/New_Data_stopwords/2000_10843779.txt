 observation level S-thiolated proteins (protein-thiol mixed disulfides) transiently increased lens epithelial cells correlation transient inactivation glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-3PD), key glycolytic enzyme, cells treated bolus hydrogen peroxide, prompted speculation G-3PD may transiently thiolated SH sensitive active center. meantime, thioltransferase (TTase), thiol regulating enzyme, whose activity remained constant condition, may regulating G-3PD sulfhydryl-sensitive glycolytic enzymes thiol-disulfide exchange reactions ( Lou et al., 1998 ). prove hypothesis, several purified glycolytic enzymes commercial source, including hexokinase (HK), G-3PD, pyruvate kinase (PK) fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), enzyme gluconeogenesis, made protein-thiol mixed disulfide used study. Glycolytic enzymes cultured rabbit lens epithelial cells pre-exposed H(2)O(2)(0.5 15 min) also studied purpose. Recombinant human lens thioltransferase (RHLT), isolated purified previously laboratory, reactivated pure glycolytic enzymes inactivated forming protein-S-S-gluthathione (PSSG), protein-S-S-cysteine (PSSC) or, protein-S-S-cysteamine thiolating oxidized glutathione, cystine cystamine respectively. RHLT also reactivated enzymes cell extract cultured rabbit lens epithelial cells briefly exposed 0.5 H(2)O(2). S-thiolation dethiolation FBPase however, showed opposite effect glycolytic enzymes. results suggest TTase may participate repair process glycolytic enzymes oxidative stress restore activities situ.
