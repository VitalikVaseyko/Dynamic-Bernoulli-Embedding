 cod fish muscle oxalacetate decarboxylase catalyzes decarboxylation oxalacetate presence NaBH4, L-lactate results reduction enzyme-bound pyruvate. However, D-lactate results borohydride reduces binary enzyme-pyruvate complex formed adding pyruvate solution, reported others. observation suggests alternate mechanisms reduction either kinetically sterically determined E-pyruvate forms produced two directions. process investigating mechanism reduction, cod fish muscle decarboxylase discovered identical pyruvate kinase. Decarboxylase activity appears take place site overlaps phosphoenolpyruvate binding site enzyme, discussed following paper. Crystalline rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase also contains significant decarboxylase activity indicating two reactions may structurally related functions. presence K+, orthophosphate, ATP rabbit muscle enzyme catalyzes detritiation enzyme-bound pyruvate formed decarboxylation release pyruvate enzyme, analogy detritiation pyruvate formed P-[3-3/]enolpyruvate kinase reaction. observation consistent formation enolpyruvate intermediate common kinetic pathways reactions. Since decarboxylase reac.tion completely stereospecific, within limits detection, going retention configuration, protonation enolpyruvate intermediate completely determined enzyme case enolpyruvate intermediate generated P-enolpyruvate kinase reaction.
