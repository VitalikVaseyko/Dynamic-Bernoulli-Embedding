 Decreased pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) apoptosis play key role pulmonary artery remodeling pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), mechanisms involved unclear. Serotonin (5-HT) inhibits apoptosis many pathologic processes activating 5-HT2A receptor. Therefore, hypothesized 5-HT may promoter decreased apoptosis PAH 5-HT2A receptor. found inhibition 5-HT2A receptor prevented increase pulmonary artery pressure pulmonary artery remodeling rats stimulated monocrotaline. effect accompanied increased apoptosis pulmonary artery. Cultured PASMCs stimulated 5-HT showed decrease apoptosis increased phosphorylation extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), mitochondrial transmembrane potential. effects markedly prevented 5-HT2A receptor inhibitor, ERK1/2 activation inhibitor peptide I, PDK inhibitor. conclusion, 5-HT inhibited PASMC apoptosis activating 5-HT2A receptor pERK1/2 PDK pathways.5-HT decreasing apoptosis 5-HT2A receptor involved, least part, pulmonary artery remolding.
