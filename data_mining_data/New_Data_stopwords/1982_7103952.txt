 1. method described using trypsin/formic acid cleavage unambiguously measuring occupancies phosphorylation sites rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase [(32)P]phosphate complexes. 2. mitochondria oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate+l-malate relative initial rates phosphorylation site 1>site 2>site 3. 3. Dephosphorylation reactivation fully phosphorylated complex initiated mitochondria inhibiting kinase reaction. Using dichloroacetate relative rates dephosphorylation site 2>(1=3). Using sodium dithionite sodium pyruvate uncouplers+sodium arsenite steady state turnover ((31)P replacing (32)P inactive complex) relative rates site 2>site 1>site 3. dithionite reactivation faster site 3 dephosphorylation, i.e. site 3 apparently inactivating. 4. steady state proportion inactive complex varied (92-48%) mitochondria oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate/l-malate increasing extramitochondrial Ca(2+) (0-2.6mum). action Ca(2+) induced dephosphorylation (site 3>site 2>site 1). experiments enable prediction site occupancies vivo given steady state proportions inactive complexes. 5. proportion inactive complex related linearly occupancy site 1. 6. Sodium dithionite (10mm) Ca(2+) (0.5mum) together resulted faster dephosphorylations site either agent alone; relative rates site 2>(1=3). 7. Dephosphorylation possibly phosphorylation sites 1 2 purely sequential shown detection complexes phosphorylated site 2 site 1. Estimates contribution site 2 phosphorylation inactivation ranged 0.7 6.4%. 8. concluded primary function site 1 phosphorylation inactivation, phosphorylation site 2 primarily concerned inactivation phosphorylation site 3 non-inactivating.
