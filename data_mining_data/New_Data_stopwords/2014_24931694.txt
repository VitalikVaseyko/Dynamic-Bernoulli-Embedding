 BACKGROUND: ChREBP (carbohydrate response element binding protein) glucose-responsive transcription factor known important regulator glycolytic lipogenic genes response glucose. hypothesized activation ChREBP could relevant anoxia survival anoxia-tolerant turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans. METHODS: Expression ChREBP response 5 20h anoxia examined using RT-PCR Western immunoblotting. addition, subcellular localization DNA-binding activity ChREBP protein assessed transcript levels liver pyruvate kinase (LPK), downstream gene ChREBP control quantified using RT-PCR. RESULTS: ChREBP anoxia-responsive kidney liver, transcript levels increasing 1.2-1.8 fold response anoxia protein levels increasing 1.8-1.9 fold. Enhanced nuclear presence anoxia also observed tissues 2.2-2.8 fold. 4.2 fold increase DNA binding activity ChREBP also observed liver response 5h anoxia. addition, transcript levels LPK increased 2.1 fold response 5h anoxia liver. CONCLUSIONS: results suggest activation ChREBP response anoxia might crucial factor anoxia survival turtle liver contributing elevated glycolytic flux initial phases oxygen limitation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: study provides first demonstration activation ChREBP response anoxia natural model anoxia tolerance, improving understanding molecular nature anoxia tolerance.
