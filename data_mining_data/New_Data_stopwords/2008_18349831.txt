 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta (PPAR beta) member nuclear hormone receptor family ligand-activated transcription factor known molecular targets including 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1(PDK1). view association PPAR beta PDK1 cancer, examined expression PPAR beta PDK1 normal ovaries different histological grades ovarian tumours. Normal ovaries, benign, borderline, grades 1, 2 3 ovarian tumours serous, muciuous, endometrioid, clear cell mixed subtypes analysed immunohistochemistry PPAR beta PDK1 expression. normal ovarian tissues, benign, borderline grade 1 tumours showed PPAR beta staining localised epithelium stroma. Staining predominantly nuclear, degree cytoplasmic staining also evident. Approximately 20% grades 2 3 tumours lacked PPAR beta staining, whereas rest displayed degree nuclear cytoplasmic staining scattered epithelium stroma. extent epithelial stromal PPAR beta staining significantly different among normal histological grades tumours (chi(2)=59.25, d.f.=25, P<0.001; chi(2)=64.48, d.f.=25, P<0.001). Significantly different staining PPAR beta observed epithelium stroma benign borderline tumours compared grades 1, 2 3 tumours (chi(2)=11.28, d.f.=4, P<0.05; chi(2)=16.15, d.f.=4, P<0.005). contrast, PDK1 immunostaining absent 9 10 normal ovaries. Weak staining PDK1 observed one normal ovary 40% benign ovarian tumours. borderline malignant ovarian tumours showed positive cytoplasmic membrane PDK1 staining. Staining PDK1 confined epithelium blood vessels, apparent staining stroma evident. Significantly different PDK1 staining observed benign/borderline malignant ovarian tumours (chi(2)=22.45, d.f.=5, P<0.001). borderline high-grade tumours, staining reactive stroma also evident. results suggest unlike colon, endometrial, head neck carcinomas, overexpression PPAR beta occur ovarian tumours. However, overexpression PDK1 evident borderline low- high-grade ovarian tumours consistent known role tumorigenesis.
