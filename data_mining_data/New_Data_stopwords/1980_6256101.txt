 Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency rate, X-linked disorder associated severe haemolytic anaemia. general deficiency demonstrated erythrocytes leucocytes. However, subject condition, activity phosphoglycerate kinase lymphocytes platelets also shown less 5% normal value. Following death subject 1979, deficiency also found occur tissue samples brain, skeletal muscle, liver cardiac muscle, obtained autopsy. Values phosphoglycerate kinase order 0.5-5% normal controls. glycolytic enzymes tested hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, enolase 2-phosphoglyceromutase. general, values enzymes either normal slightly raised.
