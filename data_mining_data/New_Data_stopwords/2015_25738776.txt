 Muscle type pyruvate kinase (PKM) one key mediators Warburg effect tumor metabolism. Due alternative splicing, least 12 known isoforms PKM gene, PKM1 PKM2 two major isoforms 23 amino acid sequenced difference quite different characteristics functions. previously thought isoform switch PKM1 PKM2 resulted high PKM2 expression tumors, providing great advantage tumor cells. However, traditional view challenged two recent studies; one study claimed isoform switch occur Warburg effect; study asserted isoform switch tissue-specific. Here, re-analyzed RNA sequencing data 25 types human tumors Cancer Genome Atlas Data Portal, confirmed PKM2 major isoform tumors highly elevated addition entire PKM gene. demonstrated expression level PKM1 significantly declined even though substantially increased expression entire PKM gene. proportion PKM1 total transcript variants also significantly declined tumors proportion PKM2 change accordingly. Therefore, conclude isoform switch PKM1 indeed occur, switches isoforms rather PKM2. Considering change expression levels PKM1, PKM2 entire PKM gene, propose upregulation PKM2 primarily due elevated transcriptional levels entire PKM gene, instead isoform switch.
