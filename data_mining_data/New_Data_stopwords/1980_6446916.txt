 demonstrated previous work hexokinase solubilized mitochondrial membrane anesthesia. present investigation effect strongly correlated surgical stage anesthesia application thiopental rats (80 mg/kg), mice (100 mg/kg) guinea pigs (32 mg/kg). solubilization hexokinase demonstrable, too, different areas rat brains thiopental treatment (80 mg/kg). order elevate cerebral concentration glucose 6-phosphate, potent substrate solubilization bound hexokinase, male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated antimetabolite 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN). i.p. injection 6-AN (35 mg/kg) measured increased activity soluble brain hexokinase order magnitude determined anesthesia. Thiopental application show significant increase. solubilization hexokinase activity 6-AN measurable vitro. Furthermore, examined key enzymes glycolytic pathway. found competitive inhibition phosphofrucktokinase activity thiopental, inhibition hexokinase pyruvate-kinase activity.
