 Yeast phosphofructo-1-kinase (Pf1k) pyruvate kinase (Pyk1) allosterically regulated enzymes catalyse essentially irreversible reactions glycolysis. synthesis activity enzymes tightly regulated. separate experimentally control Pf1k Pyk1 synthesis allosteric regulation, congenic set PFK1, PFK2 PYK1 mutants constructed wild-type coding regions driven alternative promoters. Mutants carrying PGK1 promoter fusions displayed normal rates growth, glucose consumption ethanol production, indicating relatively tight regulation Pyk1 Pf1k synthesis essential glycolytic control fermentative growth conditions. Mutants carrying fusions enhancer-less version PGK1 promoter (PGK1(Delta767)) expressed Pyk1 Pf1k 2.5-fold lower levels normal. Physiological metabolic analysis PFK1 PFK2 double mutant indicated decreased Pf1k significant effect growth, apparently due compensatory increases positive effector, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. contrast, growth rate glycolytic flux reduced PGK1(Delta767)-PYK1 mutant, decreased Pyk1 levels. Unexpectedly, reduced Pyk1 levels caused flow carbon TCA cycle increase, even fermentative growth conditions. Therefore, Pyk1 exerts significant level control rate direction carbon flux yeast.
