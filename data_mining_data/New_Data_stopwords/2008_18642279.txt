 Modifying substrate uptake systems potentially powerful tool metabolic engineering. research investigates energetic metabolic changes brought genetic modification glucose uptake phosphorylation system Escherichia coli. engineered strain PPA316, lacks E. coli phosphotransferase system (PTS) uses instead galactose-proton symport system glucose uptake, exhibited significantly altered metabolic patterns relative parent strain PPA305 retains PTS activity. Replacement PTS uptake system galactose-proton symport system expected lower carbon flux pyruvate aerobic anaerobic cultivations. extra energy cost substrate uptake non-PTS strain PPA 316 greater effect anaerobic specific growth rate, reduced factor five relative PPA 305, PPA 316 reached specific growth rate 60% PTS strain aerobic conditions. maximal cell densities obtained PPA 316 approximately 8% higher PTS strain aerobic conditions 14% lower anaerobic conditions. vivo NMR results showed non-PTS strain possesses dramatically different intracellular environment, evidenced lower levels total sugar phosphate, NAD(H), nucleoside triphosphates phosphoenolpyruvate, higher levels nucleoside diphosphates. sugar phosphate compositions, measured extract NMR, considerably different two strains. Data suggest limitations rates steps catalyzed glucokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase may responsible low overall rate glucose metabolism PPA316.
