 Six new defective pyruvate kinase variants characterized patients suffering chronic hemolysis. Partially purified enzyme variants exhibited various anomalies immunological, kinetic, stability electrophoretic points view. significance electrophoretic anomalies interpreted view normal post-synthetic maturation precursor enzyme L'4 L2L'2 L4, ability trypsin induce vitro transition L'4 leads L4 tested. One defective enzyme existed single L'4 form could transformed trypsin L4. three cases slow-moving L'4 L2L'2 forms transformed trypsin abnormal slow-moving L4 form. last two observations L'4 L2L'2 forms exhibited normal mobility normally transformed trypsin L4. relevance data functional anomalies defective variants nature primary genetic anomaly giving rise congenital defects erythrocyte pyruvate kinase discussed.
