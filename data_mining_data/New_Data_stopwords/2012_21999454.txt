 considerable biologic plausibility hypothesis genetic variability pathways involved insulin signaling energy homeostasis may modulate dietary risk associated colorectal cancer. utilized data 2 population-based case-control studies colon (n = 1,574 cases, 1,970 controls) rectal (n = 791 cases, 999 controls) cancer evaluate genetic variation candidate SNPs identified 9 genes candidate pathway: PDK1, RP6KA1, RPS6KA2, RPS6KB1, RPS6KB2, PTEN, FRAP1 (mTOR), TSC1, TSC2, Akt1, PIK3CA, PRKAG2 dietary intake total energy, carbohydrates, fat, fiber. employed SNP, haplotype, multiple-gene analysis evaluate associations. PDK1 interacted dietary fat colon rectal cancer dietary carbohydrates colon cancer. Statistically significant interaction dietary carbohydrates rectal cancer detected haplotype analysis PDK1. Evaluation dietary interactions multiple genes candidate pathway showed several interactions pairs genes: Akt1 PDK1, PDK1 PTEN, PDK1 TSC1, PRKAG2 PTEN. Analyses show genetic variation influences risk colorectal cancer associated diet illustrate importance evaluating dietary interactions beyond level single SNPs haplotypes biologically relevant candidate pathway examined.
