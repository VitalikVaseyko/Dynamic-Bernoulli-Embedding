 Medical advances made last century increased lifespan, age-related diseases fundamental health burden worldwide. Aging therefore major risk factor cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, increasing prevalence. However, huge inter-individual variations aging disease risk exist, cannot explained chronological age, rather physiological age decline initiated even young age due lifestyle. heart lies metabolic system regulated individual. Metabolic turnover food energy leads accumulation co-factors, byproducts, certain proteins, influence gene expression epigenetic regulation. epigenetic markers accumulate time investigated possible link aging many diseases, cancer. relationship metabolism cancer described early late 1950s Dr. Otto Warburg, identification DNA much earlier knowledge epigenetics. However, stepwise gene mutation theory cancer presented, Warburg's theories garnered little attention. last decade, epigenetic discoveries, Warburg's data metabolic shift cancers brought back life. stepwise gene mutation theory fails explain large animals cells, greater cancer incidence humans, known Peto's paradox. resurgence research Warburg effect given us insight may explain Peto's paradox. review, discuss connections age-related changes metabolism tightly linked cancer development, affected lifestyle choices modulating risk aging cancer epigenetic control.
