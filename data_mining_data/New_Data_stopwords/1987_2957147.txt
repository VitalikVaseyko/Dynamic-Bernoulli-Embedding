 1. Hycanthone-sensitive resistant adult worms Schistosoma mansoni found generally similar specific activities ten enzymes carbohydrate metabolism. 2. Kinetic analyses revealed pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase strains possessed similar Michaelis-Menten constants inhibited hycanthone. 3. Hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase drug-resistant strain inhibited hycanthone showed three five times greater Km values drug-sensitive worms also inhibitable hycanthone. 4. Hycanthone drastically affected Vmax phosphofructokinase hycanthone-sensitive parasite. 5. data showed hycanthone inhibitable enzymes generally drug-sensitive strain whereas enzymes drug-resistant worms mostly hycanthone insensitive.
