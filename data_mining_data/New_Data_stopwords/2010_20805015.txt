 characteristic cancer cells generation lactate glucose spite adequate oxygen oxidative phosphorylation. property - known "Warburg effect" aerobic glycolysis - contrasts anaerobic glycolysis, triggered hypoxic normal cells. Warburg effect thought provide means cancer cells survive conditions oxygen limited generate metabolites necessary cell growth. shift oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis response hypoxia mediated production hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - transcription factor family stimulates expression proteins involved glucose uptake glycolysis. reported previously elevated phospholipase (PLD) activity renal breast cancer cells required expression alpha subunits HIF1 HIF2. report aerobic glycolysis observed human breast renal cancer cells dependent elevated PLD activity. Intriguingly, effect PLD Warburg phenotype dependent mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) breast cancer cells mTORC2 renal cancer cells. data indicate elevated PLD-mTOR signaling, common human cancer cells, critical metabolic shift aerobic glycolysis.
