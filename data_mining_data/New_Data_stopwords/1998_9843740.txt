 characterize human skeletal muscle enzymatic adaptation low-carbohydrate, high-fat, high-protein diet (LCD), subjects consumed eucaloric diet consisting 5% total energy intake carbohydrate, 63% fat, 33% protein 6 days compared normal diet (52% carbohydrate, 33% fat, 14% protein). Biopsies taken vastus lateralis 3 6 days LCD. Intact mitochondria extracted fresh muscle analyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase, total PDH, carnitine palmitoyltransferase activities mitochondrial ATP production rate (using carbohydrate fat substrates). beta-Hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, active PDH (PDHa), citrate synthase activities also measured whole muscle homogenates. PDH kinase (PDHK) calculated absolute value apparent first-order rate constant inactivation PDH presence 0.3 mM Mg2+-ATP. PDHK increased dramatically 0.10 +/- 0.02 min-1 0.35 +/- 0.09 min-1 3 days 0.49 +/- 0. 06 min-1 6 days. Resting PDHa activity decreased 0.63 +/- 0.17 0.17 +/- 0.04 mmol. min-1. kg-1 6 days diet, whereas total PDH activity change. Activities enzymes unaltered LCD. summary, severe deficiency dietary carbohydrate combined twofold increase dietary fat protein caused rapid three- fivefold increase PDHK activity human skeletal muscle. increased PDHK activity downregulated amount PDH active form rest decreased carbohydrate metabolism. However, increase activities enzymes involved fatty acid oxidation occur.
