 purpose study assess impact interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) expression various drug-metabolizing enzymes transporters freshly prepared co-cultures (parenchymal non-parenchymal cells) human primary hepatocytes. therapeutically relevant concentrations (from 1000 3000 IU/mL), IFN-alpha2b up-regulated STAT1 (signal transducer activator transcription factor 1) mRNA expression. Conversely, three cytochrome P450s (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2E1), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT2B7), sulphotransferase (SULT1A1) organic anion transporter (OAT2) significantly down-regulated (~50%; P < 0.05). Western blot analysis CYP1A2, UGT2B7 OAT2 protein supported mRNA data. Two peroxisome proliferator activator receptor alpha (PPARalpha)-controlled genes (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 adipose differentiation-related protein), CYP3A4 multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 significantly up-regulated (up 223%; P < 0.05). hand, SULT2A1, carboxylesterase 2, organic anion transporting peptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1), organic cation transporter 1, P-glycoprotein breast cancer resistance protein mRNA expression significantly affected. Western blot analysis CYP3A4 supported mRNA data also. present results demonstrated complex interactions IFN-alpha2b hepatocytes observed down-regulation CYP1A2, OAT2 UGT2B7 consistent reports drug interactions IFN-alpha2b drugs theophylline, clozapine gemfibrozil.
