 KEY POINTS: Meldonium inhibits endogenous carnitine synthesis tissue uptake, accelerates urinary carnitine excretion, although impact meldonium-mediated muscle carnitine depletion whole-body fuel selection, muscle fuel metabolism molecular regulation under-investigated. Ten days oral meldonium administration impact food fluid intake, physical activity levels body weight gain rat, whereas depleted muscle carnitine content (all moieties), increased whole-body carbohydrate oxidation muscle liver glycogen utilization, reduced whole-body fat oxidation. Meldonium reduced carnitine transporter protein expression across muscles different contractile metabolic phenotypes. TaqMan PCR low-density array card approach revealed abundance 189 mRNAs regulating fuel selection altered soleus muscle meldonium, highlighting modulation discrete cellular functions metabolic pathways. novel findings strongly support premise muscle carnitine availability primary regulator fuel selection vivo. ABSTRACT: body carnitine pool primarily confined skeletal muscle, regulates carbohydrate (CHO) fat usage. Meldonium (3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)-propionate) inhibits carnitine synthesis tissue uptake, although impact carnitine depletion whole-body fuel selection, muscle fuel metabolism molecular regulation under-investigated. Male lean Zucker rats received water (control, n = 8) meldonium-supplemented water (meldonium, n = 8) 10 days [1.6 g kg(-1) body mass (BM) day(-1) days 1-2, 0.8 g kg(-1) BM day(-1) thereafter]. days 7-10, animals housed indirect calorimetry chambers soleus muscle liver harvested. Food fluid intake, weight gain physical activity levels similar groups days 7 10. Compared control, meldonium depleted muscle total carnitine (P < 0.001) carnitine esters. Furthermore, whole-body fat oxidation less (P < 0.001) CHO oxidation greater (P < 0.05) compared control, whereas soleus liver glycogen contents less (P < 0.01 P < 0.01, respectively). second study, male Wistar rats received water (n = 8) meldonium-supplemented water (n = 8) above, kidney, heart extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) soleus muscles collected. Compared control, meldonium depleted total carnitine content (all P < 0.001), reduced carnitine transporter protein glycogen content, increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA abundance heart, EDL soleus. total, 189 mRNAs regulating fuel selection differentially expressed soleus meldonium vs. control, number cellular functions pathways strongly associated carnitine depletion identified. Collectively, data firmly support premise muscle carnitine availability primary regulator fuel selection vivo.
