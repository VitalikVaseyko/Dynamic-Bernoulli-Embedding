 Lung cancer one prevalent deadly cancers United States. Experimental evidence support cancer cells exhibit higher glycolytic rates normal cells. exploit unique cancer-dependent ATP generation phenomenon, hypothesize exposure cancer cells organic inhibitors glycolysis would negatively impact survival alter growth viability resulting vast decrease essential glycolytic ATP production; negative consequences seen normal lung cells. human lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 human lung alveolar epithelial cancer cell line A549 used study models normal lung lung cancer respectively. Using standard methods, cell lines maintained exposed honey D-glucose reagents concentration levels ranging 31.3-2,000 microg/ml 96 well plates quadruplets experiments repeated least three times using MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), cell counting (T4 Cellometer; automated cell counting system) assays well phase-contrast photo-imaging. results indicate exposure cell lines organics lead concentration dependent cell destruction/cell survival depending cell line exposed. Honey D-glucose showed statistically significant (p<0.05) differential negative effects A549 line comparison unexposed control well effects MRC-5 cell line. findings show promising role honey D-glucose biotherapeutic metabolites interest selective management cancerous cells.
