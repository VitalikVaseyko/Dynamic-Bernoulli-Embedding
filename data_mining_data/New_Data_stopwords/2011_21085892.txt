Among proteins identified, 10 higher mutant strain, whereas 23 lower compared parent strain. results revealed significant decrease enzymes associated metabolic rate mutant cells aconitase, transaldolase, pyruvate kinase, changes levels specific heat shock proteins. Moreover, transketolase, aconitase catalase activity measurements decreased significantly ethidium bromide-induced petite mutant. data may useful designing experiments obtain better understanding nuclear response impairment mitochondrial function associated mutation C. glabrata.
