 Glucose utilization different metabolic pathways bovine adrenal medulla studied using freshly isolated adrenal chromaffin cells. rate net glucose utilization resting cells 10.5 mumoles X g-1 X h-1. 50% transformed lactate pyruvate, lactate pyruvate ratio ranging 3 7.27% metabolized tricarboxylic acid cycle 3.1% oxidized pentose phosphate pathway. ratio 14CO2 production [1-14C] glucose [6-14C] glucose close 2 one hour incubation. 3.2% total glucose consumed used protein synthesis, 1% incorporated lipids. Oxygen utilization respiration isolated adrenal chromaffin cells 18.2 mumoles X g-1 X h-1, corresponding 3.1 mumoles glucose X g-1 X h-1 30% total glucose consumed. activities hexokinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase assayed extracts bovine adrenal medulla, 1.0, 23, 40, 37, 6.0 3.0 U/g respectively. Hexokinase activity identified belonging mainly isoenzyme I, isoenzyme II. Enolase predominantly alpha gamma hybrid. Pyruvate kinase activity corresponded mixture isoenzymes K M. Lactate dehydrogenase activity corresponded isoenzymes 1, 2 3, smaller proportions isoenzymes 4 5. Results discussed mainly respect reported brain.
