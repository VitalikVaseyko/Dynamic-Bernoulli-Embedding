 previously obtained indirect evidence sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles cardiac skeletal muscle contain complete chain glycolytic enzymes aldolase pyruvate kinase. investigate directly whether pyruvate kinase glycolytic enzymes anatomically associated SR, electron microscopic immunogold++ labeling studies carried isolated SR vesicles using specific primary antibodies selected glycolytic enzymes Ca2+-ATPase, appropriate secondary antibodies labeled 6-nm 12-nm gold particles. Pyruvate kinase broadly dispersed cytoplasmic side SR membrane cardiac skeletal muscle vesicles. 6-nm gold particles, density binding pyruvate kinase 2522 +/- 445 4171 +/- 1379 particles/microm2 cardiac skeletal muscle SR, respectively. Binding densities Ca2 +/- ATPase similar (2550 +/- 639 particles/ microm2 cardiac SR, 3877 +/- 408 particles/microm2 skeletal muscle SR). Immunogold labeling ultrathin sections indicated pyruvate kinase attached SR membrane located immediately adjacent Ca2+-ATPase. Aldolase glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase also found attached cytoplasmic side SR vesicles located close proximity Ca2+-ATPase. results provide first ultrastructural evidence glycolytic enzymes anatomically associated SR membranes located near SR C2+-ATPase. results support hypothesis ATP generated SR-associated glycolytic enzymes coupled SR Ca2+ active transport.
