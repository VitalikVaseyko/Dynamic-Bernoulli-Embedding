 NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation hepatic microsomes vitamin E-deficient rats used assess antioxidant effectiveness dl alpha, alpha- gamma-tocopherol. tocopherols added ethanol microsomes, degree inhibition formation thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) decreased order dl alpha- greater alpha- greater gamma-tocopherol. reflected difference solubility tocopherols microsomes, dl alpha-tocopherol soluble gamma-tocopherol least. Using inhibition TBARS produced per tocopherol content microsome measure antioxidant potency, effectiveness isomers gamma- greater alpha- greater dl alpha. Despite addition pharmacological concentrations isomers, possible inhibit lipid peroxidation levels found microsomes vitamin E sufficient animals. Use ethanol vehicle may allow optimum orientation tocopherols lipid bilayer.
