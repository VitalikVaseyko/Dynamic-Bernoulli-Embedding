 Mitochondria-cytoskeleton interactions analyzed adult rat cardiomyocytes cancerous non-beating HL-1 cells cardiac phenotype. show adult cardiomyocytes betaII-tubulin associated mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). betaI-tubulin demonstrates diffused intracellular distribution, betaIII-tubulin colocalized Z-lines betaIV-tubulin forms microtubular network. HL-1 cells characterized absence betaII-tubulin, presence bundles filamentous betaIV-tubulin diffusely distributed betaI- betaIII-tubulins. Mitochondrial isoform creatine kinase (MtCK), highly expressed cardiomyocytes, absent HL-1 cells. results show high apparent K(m) exogenous ADP regulation respiration high expression MtCK correlate expression betaII-tubulin. absence betaII-tubulin isotype isolated mitochondria HL-1 cells results increased apparent affinity oxidative phosphorylation exogenous ADP. observation consistent assumption binding betaII-tubulin mitochondria limits ADP/ATP diffusion voltage-dependent anion channel MOM thus shifts energy transfer via phosphocreatine pathway. hand, absence betaII-tubulin MtCK HL-1 cells associated glycolysis-dependent energy metabolism typical cancer cells (Warburg effect).
