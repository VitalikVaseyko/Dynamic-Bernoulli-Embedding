 different turnover rates rat liver mitochondrial enzymes make autophagy unlikely main mechanism degradation mitochondria. Although alternatives presented, hepatocyte heterogeneity considered. Lighter hepatocytes isolated discontinuous Percoll gradient contain glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (half-life 1 day) active autophagic system heavier hepatocytes. latter contain carbamoyl phosphate synthase (CPS) ornithine carbamoyl transferase (OTC) (half-lives 8 days) less lysosomal activity. expected, isolated autophagic vacuoles contain, relative mitochondrial content, 3-times less OTC CPS GDH, probably reflecting faster lysosomal engulfment mitochondria light hepatocytes (which contain GDH). data may explain half-life differences enzymes studied.
