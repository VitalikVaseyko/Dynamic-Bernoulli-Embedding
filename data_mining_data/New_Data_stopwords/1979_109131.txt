 Human erythrocyte lysate proteins resolved 250 discrete spots two-dimensional electrophoresis using isoelectric focusing first dimension electrophoresis presence sodium dodecyl sulfate, (SDS) second. overwhelming excess hemoglobin made analyses difficult past. However, ISO-DALT two-dimensional electrophoresis system, large numbers red cell proteins mapped presence hemoglobin. hemoglobin several major proteins removed adsorption DEAE-cellulose, additional minor components seen, giving total 275. use purified preparations, map positions five cell enzymes subunits determined: pyruvate kinase, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, carbonic anhydrase. mapping techniques described complement extend traditionally used find human red cell protein variants.
