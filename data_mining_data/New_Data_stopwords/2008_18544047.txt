 Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) thought primarily regulate lipid oxidation control transcription genes oxidative phosphorylation pathway skeletal cardiac muscles. However, role white adipose tissue well studied. study, aimed establish role ERRalpha adipocytes down-regulating activity inverse agonist XCT-790 differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. found XCT-790 differentially reduced expression ERRalpha target genes. Specifically, XCT-790 reduced expressions peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1beta (PGC-1beta), resulting reductions mitochondrial biogenesis, adiogenesis lipogeneis. suppressing expression another ERRalpha target gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2), found XCT-790 enhanced conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA hyper-activated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also led higher levels mitochondrial membrane potential reactive oxidant species (ROS) production. Additionally, XCT-790 treatment also resulted enhanced rates glycolysis basal glucose uptake. Therefore, ERRalpha stands crossroad glucose fatty acid utilization acts homeostatic switch regulate flux TCA cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential glycolysis maintain steady level ATP production, particularly, mitochondrial biogenesis reduced.
