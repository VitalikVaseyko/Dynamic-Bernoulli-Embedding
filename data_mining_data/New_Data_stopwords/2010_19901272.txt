 prodeath effects p53 typically mediated via transcriptional upregulation proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including PUMA, Noxa, and/or Bax. previously reported staurosporine (STS), broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor prototypical apoptosis-inducing agent, produced p53-dependent, Bax-dependent, neural precursor cell (NPC) apoptosis, effect occurred independently new gene transcription PUMA expression. characterize mechanism p53 regulates NPC death, used primary cerebellar NPCs derived wild-type, p53-deficient, Bax-deficient neonatal mice mouse cerebellar neural stem cell line, C17.2. found STS rapidly increased p53 cytoplasmic immunoreactivity neuritic-like processes C17.2 cells, preceded Bax activation caspase-3 cleavage. Confocal microscopy analysis STS-treated cells revealed partial colocalization p53 mitochondrial marker pyruvate dehydrogenase well conformationally altered "activated" Bax, suggesting interaction proapoptotic molecules triggering apoptotic death. Nucleophosmin (NPM), CRM1-dependent nuclear chaperone, also exhibited partial colocalization activated Bax p53 following STS treatment. observations suggest cytoplasmic p53 trigger transcription-independent NPC apoptosis potential interaction NPM activated Bax.
