 present experiments undertaken examine hypothesis glucose-induced increased de novo synthesis 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (which observed number different tissues, including retinal capillary endothelial cells exposed elevated glucose levels vitro) associated activation protein kinase C may play role mediating glucose-induced vascular functional changes. report twice daily instillation 30 mM glucose 10 rat skin chamber granulation tissue model induces approximately 2.7-fold increase diacylglycerol (DAG) levels (versus tissues exposed 5 mM glucose) association marked increases vascular clearance albumin blood flow. glucose-induced increase DAG levels well vascular functional changes prevented addition 3 mM pyruvate. Pharmacological activation protein kinase C phorbol ester TPA presence 5 mM glucose increases microvascular albumin clearance blood flow, similar effects observed 1-monoolein (MOG), pharmacological inhibitor catabolism endogenous DAG. pharmacological inhibitor protein kinase C (staurosporine) greatly attenuates rise microvascular albumin clearance (but rise blood flow) induced glucose MOG. findings compatible hypothesis elevated concentrations glucose increase tissue DAG content via de novo synthesis, resulting protein kinase C activation, biochemical events among factors generate increased microvascular albumin clearance.
