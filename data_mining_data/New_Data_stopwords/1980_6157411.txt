 Calcium uptake rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles phosphate-containing media exhibits time-dependent changes arise changing rates calcium influx efflux. monovalent cation ionophore gramicidin, added start calcium uptake reaction, delayed spontaneous calcium release normally occurred approx. 6 min reactions; rate calcium efflux inhibited calcium influx little affected. conditions, Ca2+-activated ATPase activity could remain unaltered. Gramicidin stimulated calcium uptake irrespective presence K+ gradient across vesicle membrane. Valinomycin stimulated calcium uptake manner similar gramicidin even NaCl-containing medium lacking potassium. Thus, dissipation transmembrane K+ gradient unlikely account effects ionophores spontaneous changes calcium flux rates. Addition gramicidin partially calcium-filled vesicles inhibited phase spontaneous calcium reuptake calcium influx efflux wre inhibited. Addition gramicidin partially calcium-filled vesicles presence water-soluble protein, bovine serum albumin, creatine kinase pyruvate kinase, markedly stimulated calcium uptake. stimulatory effect due primarily inhibition calcium efflux, calcium influx minimally influenced ionophore. cleavage 100,000 dalton ATPase 50,000 dalton fragments, associated changes Ca2+-activated ATPase activity initial calcium uptake rate, gramicidin increased rather decreased calcium content added vesicles initial maximum calcium content. Thus, ability monovalent cation ionophores block calcium efflux calcium-filled vesicles may reflect interaction portion Ca2+-activated ATPase protein.
