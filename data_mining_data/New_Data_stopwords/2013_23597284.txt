 measurement donor lifetime modification Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) widely used tool detecting protein-protein interactions protein conformation change. measurements compromised presence significant noninteracting fraction molecules. Combining time-resolved intensity anisotropy measurements gives access molecular distance orientation. Fluorescent proteins frequently used detect energy transfer biological systems often exhibit decay characteristics indicative one excited state. However, little attention thus far given specific modes energy transfer, particular, states predominantly coupled. Here, use previously characterized dimerization system study energy transfer EGFP mCherry. Optically excited EGFP mCherry exhibit biexponential decays, FRET therefore involve dipole-dipole transfer four states. Analysis sensitized fluorescence anisotropy intensity decays indicates FRET transfer predominantly shorter lived EGFP emitting state (2.43 ns) longer lived (ca. 2.77 ns) minority component (ca. 16%) optically excited mCherry emission. high degree state selection two widely used FRET pairs highlights fundamental differences arise direct optical excitation isotropic molecular population dipole-dipole coupling far isotropic interaction geometry consequences regarding accurate interpretation fluorescent protein FRET data.
