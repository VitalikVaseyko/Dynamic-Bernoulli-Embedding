 Loss podocytes early feature diabetic nephropathy (DN) predicts progression. found treatment podocytes sera normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetes patients high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activity, known predict progression DN, downregulated CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2). LPS-treatment mice also reduced CDK2 expression. LPS-induced downregulation CDK2 prevented vitro vivo inhibiting Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway using immunomodulatory agent GIT27. also observed CDK2 downregulated glomeruli obese Zucker rats onset proteinuria. Knockdown CDK2, inhibiting activity roscovitine podocytes increased apoptosis. CDK2 knockdown also reduced expression PDK1, activator cell survival kinase Akt, reduced Akt phosphorylation. suggests CDK2 regulates activity cell survival pathway via PDK1. Furthermore, PDK1 knockdown reduced expression CDK2 suggesting regulatory loop CDK2 PDK1. Collectively, data show CDK2 protects podocytes apoptosis reduced expression CDK2 associates development DN. Preventing downregulation CDK2 blocking TLR pathway GIT27 may provide means prevent podocyte apoptosis progression DN.
