 Erythrocyte PK deficiency detected family Latium Italy. PK variant characterized normal increased activity immediately blood collection, instability storage, heat urea. propositus mutant enzyme exhibited increased Michaelis constant PEP, slightly increased inhibition ATP altered optimum pH value. kinetic anomaly partially corrected activation F-1, 6-DP addition 2-ME. results concluded family observed two distinct erythrocyte PK alterations demonstrable: instability propositus father; low affinity PEP altered optimum pH value propositus.
