 Net photosynthetic (14)CO(2) fixation isolated maize (Zea mays) bundle sheath strands stimulated 20 35% inclusion l-glutamate l-aspartate reaction mixture. Maximal stimulation occurred 7.5 mm concentration either amino acid. Since photosynthetic rate glutamate-dependent stimulation rate equally sensitive photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor, 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, concluded glutamate stimulate CO(2) fixation supplying needed NADPH (NADH) glutamate dehydrogenase. Treatment bundle sheath strands glutamate inhibited glycolate synthesis 59%. Photorespiration tissue, measured O(2) inhibition CO(2) fixation (the Warburg effect), inhibited treatment glutamate. stimulation net photosynthetic CO(2) fixation probably results decrease photorespiratory CO(2) loss. metabolic regulation rate glycolate synthesis photorespiration observed isolated bundle sheath strands could account inability detect rapid photorespiration mature intact maize leaf.
