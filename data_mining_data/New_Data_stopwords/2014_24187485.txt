 Proteomic approaches continuing make headways cancer research helping elucidate complex signaling networks underlie tumorigenesis disease progression. review describes recent advances made proteomic discovery drug targets therapeutic development. variety technical methodological advances overviewed critical assessment challenges potentials. number potential drug targets, baculoviral inhibitor apoptosis protein repeat-containing protein 6, macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1, phosphoglycerate mutase 1, prohibitin 1, fascin, pyruvate kinase isozyme 2 identified proteomic analysis drug-resistant cancer cells, drug action, differential disease state tissues. Future directions proteomics-based target identification validation translation efficient also discussed.
