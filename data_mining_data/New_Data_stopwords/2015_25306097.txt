 BACKGROUND: Strongly increased uptake glucose hallmark solid malignant tumors. phenotype triggered hypoxia-induced gene expression changes occur independently hypoxia consequence malignant transformation itself, often referred Warburg effect. glycolytic phenotype associated malignant progression resistance radio- chemotherapy. METHODS: chosen squamous cell carcinomas vulva (SCC-V) representative solid tumor entity study central players pathway, namely glucose transporter (GLUT)-1, carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX, hexokinase (HK)-2 pyruvate kinase (PK)-M2, investigated relationships tumor microvessels (CD34, alphaSMA) proliferation (Ki67). Expression proteins analyzed 38 SCC-Vs, 5 vulvar dysplasias 10 non-neoplastic squamous epithelia vulva using multiparametric immunohistochemistry registered serial sections (MIRSS). RESULTS: Expression GLUT-1 invasive carcinomas predominantly located outer layers tumor cell aggregates close vascularized tumor stroma, lesser extent colocalized CA IX, repeatedly found larger diffusion distances away microvessels. CA IX expression lower invasive carcinomas compared dysplasias non-neoplastic tissue higher recurrent vs. primary tumors. Ki67-positive proliferating cells partially colocalized GLUT-1. However, HK-2 PK-2--proteins centrally involved Warburg phenotype--did show correlation. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent prior studies, pattern GLUT-1 clearly indicated large part expression presumably unrelated hypoxia. However, also association HK-2 PK-M2, suggesting functional background expression also independent aerobic glycolysis. CA IX may worth consideration marker biological hypoxia, pathophysiological consequences SCC-V.
