 Continuous cultures, cellobiose sufficient concentrations (14. 62 mM) using chemically defined medium, examined determine carbon regulation selected Clostridium cellulolyticum. Using synthetic medium, q(cellobiose) 2.57 mmol g cells(-1) h(-1) attained whereas highest value obtained complex media 0.68 mmol g cells(-1) h(-1) (Payot et al. 1998. Microbiology 144:375-384). synthetic medium = 0.035 h(-1) cellobiose excess, lactate ethanol biosynthesis able use reducing equivalents supplied acetic acid formation H(2)/CO(2) ratio found equal 1. higher dilution rate (D = 0.115 h(-1)), lactate production pathways toward ethanol NADH-ferredoxin-hydrogenase contributed balance reducing equivalents; case H(2)/CO(2) ratio 1.54 found. increasing D, progressive increase (i) steady-state concentration NADH NAD(+) pools 11.8 22.1 micromol (g cells) (-1), (ii) intracellular NADH/NAD(+) ratios 0.43 1.51. synthetic media, cellobiose excess carbon flow also equilibrated three overflows: exopolysaccharide, extracellular protein, amino acid excretions. = 0.115 h(-1), 34% cellobiose consumed converted exopolysaccharides; deviation carbon flow increase phosphoroclastic activity decreased dramatically pyruvate excretion explained break lactate production. Whatever dilution rate, C. cellulolyticum, using ammonium cellobiose excess, always spilled usual amino acids accompanied amino compounds. vitro, GAPDH, phosphoroclastic reaction, alcohol dehydrogenase, acetate kinase activities high conditions giving high vivo specific production rates. also correlations vitro lactate dehydrogenase activity vivo lactate production, contrast preceding activities, two parameters decreased D. results demonstrate C. cellulolyticum able optimize carbon catabolism cellulosic substrates synthetic medium.
