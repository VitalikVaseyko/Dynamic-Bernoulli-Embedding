 Perfusion rat liver situ 150 min provides maintaining optimal values acid-base balance following indexes: surplus bases, content standard bicarbonate, buffer bases pH, pO2, pCO2, HbO2, level bile secretion, content lactate, pyruvate, ATP, ADP, evidences high functional activity tissue. Introduction dinitro-ortho-cresol (DNC) perfusion liquid causes development acidosis. DNC results dissociation oxidative phosphorylation: content ATP intensity inorganic phosphorus utilization decrease, oxygen uptake intensifies. compensatory increase glycolysis intensity directed maintaining level macroergs conditions pronounced intensified uptake glucose, rise content lactate perfusate increase pyruvate kinase activity liver. redox state NAD-pairs (ratio [NAD+] : [NADN] calculated content redox metabolites equilibrium constant lactate dehydrogenase system shifts toward increase reducing properties hepatocytes cytoplasm. phosphate potential value calculated ratio [ATP] : [ADP] - [Pinor] lowers conditions experiment.
