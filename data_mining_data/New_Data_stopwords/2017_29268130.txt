 Shikonin exhibits powerful anticancer activities various cancer cells, poor solubility strong toxicity hinder development clinical anticancer agent. previously confirmed shikonin derivatives disturb mitosis targeting tubulin. study, alpha-lipoic acid, naturally-occurring co-factor pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), introduced shikonin design twin drugs mitosis (tubulin) glycolysis (PDK). 18 kinds alpha-lipoic acid shikonin ester derivatives achieved three rounds screening process performed computer assistant drug design method, designated outstanding compounds. Among them, 1c displayed potent cytotoxicity towards cervical cancer cells (HeLa) IC50 value 3.14 +/- 0.58 muM inhibited xenotransplanted tumor growth dose-dependent manner. pharmacologic study demonstrated 1c cause cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Moreover, also showed good PDK1 inhibitory activity, promoting PDH activity forced HeLa cells process aerobic metabolism undergo cell apoptosis. reported first dual inhibitors tubulin PDK1 based shikonin. may form basis shikonin optimization twin drug design framework discovery new potent shikonin derivatives study targeted cancer therapy.
