 pyruvate kinase gene pyk Corynebacterium glutamicum cloned applying combination PCR, site-specific mutagenesis, complementation. 126-bp DNA fragment central C. glutamicum pyk gene amplified genomic DNA PCR degenerate oligonucleotides primers. cloned DNA fragment used inactivate pyk gene C. glutamicum marker rescue mutagenesis via homologous recombination. C. glutamicum pyk mutant obtained unable grow minimal medium containing ribose sole carbon source. Complementation phenotype gene library resulted isolation 2.8-kb PstI-BamHI genomic DNA fragment harboring C. glutamicum pyk gene. Multiple copies plasmid-borne pyk caused 20-fold increase pyruvate kinase activity C. glutamicum cell extracts. using large internal fragments cloned C. glutamicum gene, pyk mutant derivatives lysine production strain Corynebacterium lactofermentum 21799 generated marker rescue mutagenesis. determined shake flask fermentations, lysine production pyk mutants 40% lower pyk+ parent strain, indicating pyruvate kinase essential high-level lysine production. finding questions earlier hypothesis postulating redirection carbon flow phosphoenol pyruvate branch point glycolysis elimination pyruvate kinase activity results increase lysine production C. glutamicum close relatives.
