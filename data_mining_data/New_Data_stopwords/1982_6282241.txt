 Male Wistar rats fed fluoride deficient diet (less 0.5 parts/10(6) F), either distilled water fluoridated water (1.0 parts/10(6)). week 3, control group urinary excretions 106 +/- 5 nmol cAMP/day (mean +/- SEM) whereas experimental group excreted 129 +/- 6 nmol cAMP/day. 111 days, control group excreted 270 +/- 26 nmol cAMP/day compared 600 +/- 78 nmol cAMP/day experimental group. Body weight, food water consumption, urine volume, urinary creatinine phosphate levels significantly different two groups. Tissue cAMP levels determined 4, 6 16 weeks. week 4, rats receiving fluoridated water significantly higher levels cAMP liver (113 per cent) tibia (130 per cent), femur (89 per cent) heart (35 per cent). week 6, liver (119 per cent), tibia (296 per cent), heart (168 per cent), kidney (73 per cent) submandibular gland (27 per cent) significantly higher levels cAMP. week 16, liver, femur, kidney submandibular gland continued elevated levels cAMP. Liver glycolytic metabolites determined 6 weeks, results suggested decrease pyruvate kinase activity.
