 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) human embryonal carcinoma cells (hECCs) studied extensively levels genome, transcriptome, proteome epigenome knowledge corresponding metabolomes limited. Here, present metabolic signatures hESCs hESCs obtained untargeted gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Whilst metabolites common cell types, representing self-renewal house-keeping signatures, others either higher (e.g., octadecenoic acid, glycerol-3-phosphate, 4-hydroxyproline) lower (e.g., glutamic acid, mannitol, malic acid, GABA) hESCs (H9) compared hECCs (NTERA2), represent cell type specific signatures. Further, combined results GC-MS microarray based gene expression profiling undifferentiated OCT4-depleted hESCs consistent Warburg effect increased glycolysis embryonic cells tumor cells presence O(2) oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) impaired even shut down. RNAi-based OCT4 knock mediated differentiation resulted activation poised OXPHOS machinery expressing missing key proteins NDUFC1, UQCRB COX, increase TCA cycle activity decreased lactate metabolism. results shed light metabolite layer pluripotent stem cells could potentially establish novel metabolic markers self renewal pluripotency.
