 study, investigated genome-wide gene expression profiles liver tissue diabetic rats RS treatment. microarray-based analysis revealed total 173 genes up-regulated 197 genes down-regulated response RS treatment. genes mainly related glucose metabolism (e.g., hexokinase, pyruvate kinase phosphotransferase etc.), lipid metabolism (e.g., carnitine palmitoyl transfer 1, fatty acid transporter, beta hydroxyl butyric dehydrogenase etc.). Cluster analysis results showed up/down-regulated genes highly responsive RS treatment, considered directly indirectly associated reducing plasma glucose body fat. interpret mechanism RS regulation molecular level, novel gene network constructed based 370 up/down-regulated genes coupled 718 known diabetes-related genes. topology network showed characteristics small-world scale-free network, pathways demonstrating high degree. Forkhead class signaling pathway, degree 8, analyzed found effect mainly glucose lipid metabolism processes. results indicate RS suppress development type 2 diabetes STZ rat model modulating expression multiple genes involved glucose lipid metabolism. potential application novel gene network also discussed.
