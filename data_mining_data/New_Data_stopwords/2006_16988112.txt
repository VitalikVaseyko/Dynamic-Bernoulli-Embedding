 pathways glycerol-3-P (G3P) generation examined retroperitoneal (RETRO) epididymal (EPI) adipose tissues rats fed cafeteria diet 3 wk. cafeteria diet induced marked increases body fat mass plasma levels insulin triacylglycerol (TAG). RETRO EPI cafeteria diet-fed rats increased rates norepinephrine turnover (143 60%, respectively) de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis (58 98%), compared controls fed balanced commercial diet. Cafeteria diet feeding induced marked increases RETRO EPI vivo rates glucose uptake (52 51%, respectively), used evaluate G3P generation via glycolysis, well glycerokinase activity (119 36%) TAG-glycerol synthesis glycerol (56 71%, respectively). contrast, marked reduction glyceroneogenesis RETRO EPI cafeteria diet-fed rats, evidenced significant decreases P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C) activity (48 36%) TAG-glycerol synthesis pyruvate (45 56%, respectively). Denervation RETRO cafeteria diet-fed rats reduced activity glycerokinase 50%, affect glucose uptake PEPCK-C activity TAG-glycerol synthesis pyruvate tissue. data show glyceroneogenesis also inhibited adjust supply G3P existing rates FA esterification TAG synthesis suggest adjustment made reciprocal changes generation G3P glucose via glycolysis glyceroneogenesis, independently G3P production glycerokinase.
