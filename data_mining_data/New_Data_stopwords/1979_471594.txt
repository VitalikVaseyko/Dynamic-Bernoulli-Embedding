 metabolic capacity neonatal monocytes compared metabolic capacity adult monocytes two entirely different methods: selective diminution monocyte contamination whole mononuclear cells isolation relatively purified populations monocytes. Monocyte removal whole mononuclear cells produced diminution pyruvate kinase (PK) activity (from 28.6 +/- 1.1 15.6 +/- 1.2 nmoles/min/10(7) cells) increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content (from 7.9 +/- 1.0 9.5 +/- 0.8 nmoles/10(7) cells) adult cells. change PK activity (from 13.5 +/- 1.3 14.0 +/- 1.3) observed cord cells, ATP content cord cells higher monocytes depletion (from 4.7 +/- 0.5 6.2 +- 0.7). suggestion metabolic vulnerability confirmed metabolic analysis isolated adult cord monocytes. PK activity adult monocytes greater cord monocytes (57 +/- 9 25 +/- 0.3, respectively) ATP content adult monocytes (5.7 +/- 0.2) greater cord monocytes (2.3 +/- 0.1). data confirm prior observations diminished energy metabolism neonatal mononucler cells suggest metabolic perturbations may, part, correlate functional immaturity neonatal monocyte.
