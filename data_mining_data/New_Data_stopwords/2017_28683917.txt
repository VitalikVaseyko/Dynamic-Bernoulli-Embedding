 Biotin-dependent carboxylases widely distributed nature central roles metabolism fatty acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, compounds. last decade seen accumulation structural information large holoenzymes, including 500-kDa dimeric yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylase, 750-kDa alpha6beta6 dodecameric bacterial propionyl-CoA carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, geranyl-CoA carboxylase, 720-kDa hexameric bacterial long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase, 500-kDa tetrameric bacterial single-chain pyruvate carboxylase, 370-kDa alpha2beta4 bacterial two-subunit pyruvate carboxylase, 130-kDa monomeric eukaryotic urea carboxylase. common theme emerged studies dramatic structural flexibility holoenzymes despite strong overall sequence conservation, evidenced extensive diversity architectures holoenzymes extensive conformational variability domains subunits. structural flexibility crucial function regulation enzymes identifying compounds interfere represents attractive approach developing novel modulators drugs. extensive diversity observed structures far biochemical functional implications focus review.
