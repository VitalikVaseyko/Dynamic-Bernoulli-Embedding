 transfusion young red blood cells (neocytes) complementary approach present treatment thalassaemia major patients. Fresh neocytes harvested 34 volunteers IBM 2991 cell washer (CW). upper part 24 units separated 6 aliquots (T1-T6) 15 ml residue homogenized. Four biological criteria used evaluate young red cell quality, erythrocyte pyruvate kinase activity, mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count ektacytometry; sample (T1-T6) showed enrichment neocytes compared standard unit. real efficiency technique IBM 2991 CW obtained first third unit, corresponding T1-T4 fractions. estimation theoretical mean life span T1-T2 270 days. last 10 units separated two halves: enrichment first half worse first third previous technique. concluded transfusional program thalassaemia patients could profit use enriched part standard blood unit IBM 2991 CW.
