 pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (PDCs) known living organisms comprise three principal catalytic components mission: E1 E2 generate acetyl-coenzyme A, whereas FAD/NAD(+)-dependent E3 performs redox recycling. compare bacterial (Escherichia coli) human PDCs, represent two major classes superfamily 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes different assembly of, interactions among components. human PDC subject inactivation E1 serine phosphorylation four kinases, inactivation reversed action two phosphatases. Progress understanding complexes important metabolism reviewed.
