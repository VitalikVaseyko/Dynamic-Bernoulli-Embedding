 BACKGROUND: metabolism cancer cells often reprogrammed dysregulation metabolic enzymes. Transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) homodimeric transketolase linking pentose-phosphate pathway glycolytic pathway. generally silenced transcriptional level somatic tissues. However, human cancers expression associated acquisition glycolytic phenotype (the Warburg effect) cancer cells contributes progression malignant tumors. melanoma, defective promoter methylation results expression genes products affect tumor cell's phenotype including modification immune functional characteristics. present study evaluates role TKTL1 mediator disease progression melanoma associated defective methylation phenotype. METHODS: expression TKTL1 metastatic melanoma tumors cell lines analysed qRT-PCR immunohistochemistry. promoter methylation status TKTL1 melanoma cells evaluated quantitative methylation specific PCR. Using qRT-PCR, effect DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza) expression TKTL1 examined. Biochemical molecular analyses glucose consumption, lactate production, invasion, proliferation cell cycle progression together ectopic expression siRNA mediated knockdown used investigate role TKTL1 melanoma cells. RESULTS: Expression TKTL1 highly restricted normal adult tissues overexpressed subset metastatic melanoma tumors derived cell lines. TKTL1 promoter activated hypomethylation treatment 5aza induced TKTL1 expression melanoma cells. Augmented expression TKTL1 melanoma cells associated glycolytic phenotype. Loss gain function studies revealed TKTL1 contributed enhanced invasion melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: data provide evidence important role TKTL1 aerobic glycolysis tumor promotion melanoma may result defective promoter methylation. epigenetic change may enable natural selection tumor cells metabolic phenotype thereby provide potential therapeutic target subset melanoma tumors elevated TKTL1 expression.
