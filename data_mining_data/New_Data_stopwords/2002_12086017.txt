 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) expresses isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (type M2). dimeric form (TuM2-PK) expressed tumor cells detectable blood sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). aim present study evaluate clinical value TuM2-PK tumor marker RCC. TuM2-PK concentration EDTA-plasma determined quantitatively immunologically using ELISA. measured TuM2-PK plasma levels 83 patients surgery. Ninety-seven patients various non-malignant diseases also recruited control group. control group displayed mean levels 11.37 U/ml TuM2-PK. Values elevated patients RCC prior surgery (mean 21.88 U/ml). plasma levels increased surgery day 5 (mean 53.97 U/ml). day 10, marker levels started decrease without reaching preoperative values (mean 43.5 U/ml). Plasma levels renal vein (obtained surgery) different peripheral blood. Follow-ups 2-6 months showed decrease preoperative levels (mean 16.3 U/ml). significant difference obtained comparing patients according Robson score. found significant difference (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon's two-sample test) TuM2-PK levels patients RCC control group. Nevertheless, using manufacturer's recommended cut-off value (15 U/ml), sensitivity 50.6% specificity 80.4%. results suggest TuM2-PK suitable tumor marker RCC.
