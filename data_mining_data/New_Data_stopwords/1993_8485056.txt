 investigated iron status 33 pyruvate kinase (PK) deficient patients, cases reported Italy. Serum ferritin (SF) higher upper limit range matched controls 15/25 (60%) non-transfused patients (median 228 micrograms/l, range 58-3160 v 43, 22-310). Liver siderosis fibrosis found 8/9, cirrhosis two died age 39 42 complications iron overload. SF independent age, sex, severity haemolysis. prevalence HLA-A3 antigen PK deficient patients significantly different healthy population (29.6% v 23%). HLA-A3 positive, non-transfused patients significantly higher SF values HLA-A3 negative ones (median 675 micrograms/l, range 340-3160 v 145, 58-400). pedigree study six high SF-probands indicated iron overload multifactorial pathogenesis. particular, association PK deficiency-induced haemolysis, splenectomy additional factor (heterozygosity idiopathic haemochromatosis, ineffective erythropoiesis) leads severe iron accumulation. suggest monitoring iron status would useful PK deficient patients, particularly splenectomized HLA-A3 positive ones, identify risk iron overload prevent clinical consequences iron accumulation.
