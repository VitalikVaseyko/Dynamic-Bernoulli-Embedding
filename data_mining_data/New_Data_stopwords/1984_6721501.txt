 Isolated rabbit liver branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inhibited mixed manner relative ATP alpha-ketoisocaproate, alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate, alpha-ketoisovalerate, alpha-ketocaproate, alpha-ketovalerate, alpha-chloroisocaproate I40 values (mM), respectively, 0.065, 0.49, 2.5, 0.2, 0.5, 0.08. concentration (mM) alpha-ketoisocaproate, alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate, alpha-ketoisovalerate needed activate branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase perfused rat heart 50% total activity 0.07, 0.10, 0.25, respectively. Isolated branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase inhibited (I40 values, mM) octanoate (0.5), acetoacetyl-CoA (0.01), methylmalonyl-CoA (0.2), NADP+ (1.5), heparin (12 micrograms/ml). kinase activity, presence absence ADP, inhibited approximately 30% 0.1 mM isobutyryl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, affected NAD+ NADH (1 mM), CoA, acetyl-CoA, methylcrotonyl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA, beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl-glutaryl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA (0.1 mM). following compounds 2 mM also inhibit branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase; acetate, propionate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, acetoacetate, malonate, alpha-ketomalonate, succinate, citrate, oxaloacetate, FAD, NADPH. findings help explain unique effects Leu compared Val Ile branched-chain amino acid metabolism differences control kinases associated pyruvate dehydrogenase branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase.
