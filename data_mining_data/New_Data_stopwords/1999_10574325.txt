 Triacylglycerol synthesis studied hepatocytes isolated fasted/refed rats EDTA perfusion. Insulin induced 1.5-fold increase glucose incorporation triacylglycerol. Insulin-stimulated triacylglycerol synthesis insulin-stimulated protein kinase B/Akt activity inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin LY 294002, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059. Inhibition p70 ribosomal protein-S6 kinase rapamycin without effect. Insulin-stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity abolished phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. effect insulin acetyl CoA carboxylase activity observed.
