 Compared normal cells, cancer cells show alterations many cellular processes, including energy metabolism. Studies cancer metabolism started Otto Warburg's observation beginning last century. According Warburg, cancer cells rely glycolysis mitochondrial respiration energy production. Considering glycolysis yields much less energy compared mitochondrial respiration, Warburg hypothesized mitochondria must dysfunctional initiating factor cancer formation. However, hypothesis convince every scientist field. believed opposite: reduction mitochondrial activity result increased glycolysis. discrepancy opinions ongoing. review, discuss alterations glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, Krebs cycle cancer cells focus cause consequence.
