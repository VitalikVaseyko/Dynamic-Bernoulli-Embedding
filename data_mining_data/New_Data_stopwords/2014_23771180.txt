 response E. coli Hg(2+) exposure investigated using proteomic metalloproteomic approaches. E. coli cultured LB medium containing HgCl2 and/or selenomethionine. growth curve E. coli measured estimate toxicity Hg(2+) selenomethionine. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), distribution Hg 2-DE gel detected synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) 4W1B, Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. proteins differential expression containing Hg identified electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. results showed Hg(2+) inhibit growth E. coli, supplement selenomethionine shorten lag period induced Hg(2+), indicating antagonistic effect selenomethionine Hg(2+) toxicity. Mechanistically, Hg observed able bind pyruvate kinase, glycolytic enzyme, modulate expression five proteins, including down-regulation outer membrane protein W up-regulation transcription termination factor rho, cysteine synthase, transaldolase alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C. Therefore, results indicated mercury may influence osmosis plasma membrane, antioxidant defense, glycometabolism microorganism. study demonstrates high sensitivity SRXRF identifying metal-associated proteins compared conventional proteomic approaches.
