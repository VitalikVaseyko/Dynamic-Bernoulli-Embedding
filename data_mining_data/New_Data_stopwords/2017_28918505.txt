 Ground squirrel torpor winter hibernation characterized numerous physiological biochemical changes, including alterations fuel metabolism. torpor, many tissues switch carbohydrate lipid catabolism, often regulating key enzymes within glycolytic lipolytic pathways. study investigates potential regulation pyruvate kinase (PK), key member glycolytic pathway, within skeletal muscle hibernating ground squirrels. PK purified skeletal muscle control torpid Richardson's ground squirrels, PK kinetics, structural stability, posttranslational modifications subsequently assessed. Torpid PK displayed nearly threefold increase K PEP compared control PK assayed 5 degrees C. ProQ Diamond phosphoprotein staining well phospho-specific western blots indicated torpid PK significantly phosphorylated euthermic control. PK torpid condition also shown possess nearly twofold acetyl content compared control PK. conclusion, skeletal muscle PK Richardson's ground squirrel may regulated posttranslationally euthermic torpid states, may inhibit PK functioning torpor accordance decrease glycolytic rate dormancy.
