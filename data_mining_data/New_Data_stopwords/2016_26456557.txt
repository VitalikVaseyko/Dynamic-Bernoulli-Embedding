 widespread avian pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum causative agent respiratory disease. wall-less prokaryotes lack tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, therefore, glycolysis metabolic pathway great importance organisms. Pyruvate kinase (PK) one key enzymes glycolytic pathway, immunological characteristics Mycoplasma well known. study, M. gallisepticum pyruvate kinase fusion protein (PykF) expressed pET system. full-length gene subcloned expression vector pET28a(+) construct pET28a-rMGPykF plasmid, transformed Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells. expression 62 kDa recombinant protein rMGPykF E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) confirmed sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Coomassie blue staining. Purified rMGPykF exhibited PK catalytic activity, could fl ect conversion NADH NAD(+). Mouse anti-PykF antibodies generated immunization mice rMGPykF. Immunoblot immunoelectron microscopy assays identified PykF immunogenic protein expressed surface M. gallisepticum cells. Bactericidal assay showed anti-rMGPykF antiserum killed 70.55% M. gallisepticum cells, suggesting protective potential PykF. Adherence inhibition assay immortalized chicken fibroblasts (DF-1) cells revealed 39.31% inhibition adhesion presence anti-rMGPykF antiserum, suggesting PykF M. gallisepticum participates bacterial adhesion DF-1 cells.
