 effects starvation, refeeding diet high carbohydrate, administration glucagon cyclic AMP, thyroidectomy, adrenalectomy transcription gene liver L-type pyruvate kinase accumulation cytoplasmic mRNA L-type pyruvate kinase investigated rat. Transcription gene undetectable either fasted protein-fed rats. Refeeding fasted rats carbohydrate-rich diet stimulated increase L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA, preceded increase gene transcription. Transcription maximal 12 h refeeding, decreasing 10% maximum 72 h. level L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA remained constant 50% maximum least 120 h. Neither thyroidectomy adrenalectomy affected gene transcription fasted rats refed carbohydrate-rich diet, despite decrease mRNA abundance 40 20%, respectively, controls fed normal diet. Glucagon cyclic AMP totally blocked increase transcription L-type pyruvate kinase gene caused feeding carbohydrate-rich diet previously fasted rats. Nevertheless, level L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA remained high 3 h glucagon administration. 3 h, mRNA decreased rapidly half-life less 1 h. Thus, expression gene L-type pyruvate kinase regulated transcriptional post-transcriptional levels. transcription regulated two major effectors, one positive, namely carbohydrates, one negative, namely glucagon (via cyclic AMP). agents probably act level mRNA stability well. Glucocorticoids thyroid hormones regulate transcription gene L-type pyruvate kinase appear required normal accumulation transcripts cytoplasm.
