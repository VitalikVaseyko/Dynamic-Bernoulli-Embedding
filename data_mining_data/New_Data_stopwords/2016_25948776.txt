 Tumor cells metabolize glucose lactate aerobic hypoxic conditions non-tumor cells. Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) crucial tumor cell aerobic glycolysis. established role let-7a/c-Myc/hnRNPA1/PKM2 signaling glioma cell glucose metabolism. PKM2 depletion via siRNA inhibits cell proliferation aerobic glycolysis glioma cells. C-Myc promotes up-regulation hnRNPA1 expression, hnRNPA1 binding PKM pre-mRNA, subsequent formation PKM2. pathway downregulated microRNA let-7a, functionally targets c-Myc, whereas hnRNPA1 blocks biogenesis let-7a counteract ability downregulate c-Myc/hnRNPA1/PKM2 signaling pathway. down-regulation c-Myc/ hnRNPA1/PKM2 let-7a verified using glioma xenograft model. results suggest let-7a, c-Myc hnRNPA1 feedback loop, thereby regulating PKM2 expression modulate glucose metabolism glioma cells. findings elucidate new pathway mediating aerobic glycolysis gliomas provide attractive potential target therapeutic intervention.
