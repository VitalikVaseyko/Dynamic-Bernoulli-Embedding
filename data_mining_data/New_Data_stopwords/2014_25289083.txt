 Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2 M2-PK) often involved tumorigenesis growth. Aberrant activation Hh signaling found variety malignancies. tumor cells, PKM2 determines whether glucose used synthesis cellular building blocks production lactate energy regeneration; associated Warburg effect. Gli1 downstream molecule Hh signaling pathway; however, association Hh signaling PKM2 well understood. present study, identified PKM2 Gli1 expression levels significantly elevated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared para-carcinoma. vitro study revealed overexpression PKM2 HepG2 cells upregulated transcription Gli1, ablation PKM2 shRNA caused downregulation Gli1 gene expression. Gli1 transcription could rescued PKM2. Overall, findings suggest PKM2 regulator Gli1 gene expression HCC, may contribute tumorigenesis Gli1.
