 Diabetes rats characterized insulin deficiency accompanied decrease lipogenic enzymes. malic enzyme (ME) gene, encodes important lipogenic enzyme, used investigate insulin regulation gene expression. mRNA levels reduced 90% liver diabetic rats. administration insulin (3 U/15 days) either control diabetic rats increased mRNA 2- 10-fold, respectively. Since diabetes reduces circulating T3 levels nuclear T3-receptors, potential role thyroid hormone insulin regulation gene expression also evaluated thyroidectomized-diabetic rats. animals levels mRNA undetectable increased insulin even absence thyroid hormones. vivo effects insulin T3 additive. transcription rate gene also reduced diabetic liver recovered insulin therapy. computer analyses identified two different putative insulin response elements (IREs) gene promoter, hereafter referred IRE-I (-683 -692), similar phosphoenol pyruvate carboxy kinase promoter IRE IRE-II (-161 -170), similar glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter IRE-A. Results gel retardation assays suggest single nuclear protein binds IRE-I whereas two different nuclear proteins bind IRE-II. protein/IRE-I complex increased liver nuclear extracts diabetic rats decreased insulin administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
