 1. intracellular location maximal activities enzymes involved phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis investigated pigeon liver. Enolase pyruvate kinase cytoplasmic, activities 50-60 180-210mumoles/min./g. dry wt. 25 degrees respectively. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase present exclusively, nucleoside diphosphokinase predominantly, mitochondria; particles disrupted elicit maximal activities, 27-33 400-600mumoles/min./g. dry wt. 25 degrees respectively. activities four enzymes change significantly 48hr. starvation. 2. Conditions incubation washed isolated mitochondria established, give high rates synthesis phosphoenolpyruvate, linear time proportional mitochondrial concentration. Inorganic phosphate added adenine nucleotides stimulatory, whereas added Mg(2+) inhibited, partly owing activation contaminant pyruvate kinase. Phosphoenolpyruvate formation occurred oxaloacetate, malate, fumarate, succinate, alpha-oxoglutarate citrate, decreasing order effectiveness. 3. steady-state ATP/ADP ratio mitochondrial suspensions decreased presence added 2.5mm-Mg(2+) (owing stimulation adenylate kinase possibly adenosine triphosphatase), 0.5mm-Ca(2+) 0.4mm-dinitrophenol. case rate substrate removal oxygen uptake increased, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis inhibited. Citrate formation enhanced, owing de-inhibition citrate synthase. effects primarily related changes oxaloacetate concentration. 4. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase nucleoside diphosphokinase active within atractylosidesensitive barrier mitochondrial metabolism added adenine nucleotides. correlation rate substrate-level phosphorylation associated oxidation alpha-oxoglutarate, synthesis phosphoenolpyruvate. 5. results suggest phosphoenolpyruvate formation pigeon-liver mitochondria regulated partly phosphorylation state adenine guanine nucleotides, partly variations oxaloacetate concentration, mitochondrial matrix. 6. Phosphoenolpyruvate assumed metabolite transported mitochondria cytoplasm gluconeogenesis oxaloacetate pigeon liver.
