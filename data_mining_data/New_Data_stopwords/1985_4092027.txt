 (E)-3-Cyanophosphoenolpyruvate synthesized reacting dimethyl chlorophosphate potassium enolate ethyl cyanopyruvate. resulting trialkyl ester deesterified bromotrimethylsilane followed potassium hydroxide. Subsequent treatment Dowex-50-H+ resin cyclohexylamine afforded tricyclohexylammonium salt; E geometric isomer obtained. compound photoisomerized 70:30 E:Z mixture. (E)-3-Cyanophosphoenolpyruvate excellent competitive inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase [KI(Mn2+) = 16 microM, KI(Mg2+) = 1360 microM], pyruvate kinase [KI(Mn2+) = 0.085 microM, KI(Mg2+) = 0.76 microM], enolase [KI(Mn2+) = 360 microM, KI(Mg2+) = 280 microM]. compound substrate pyruvate kinase (Vmax approximately 1% phosphoenolpyruvate rate), two enzymes. irreversible inactivation observed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase.
