 stop-experiment using hepatocarcinogen N-nitrosomorpholine, well glycogenotic related lesions, hepatocellular foci different histochemical pattern identified. outstanding features hepatic foci, may progress hepatocellular adenoma, increased activities mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mG3PD), glycogen synthase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphatase detected enzyme histochemistry. Since decrease activity enzymes examined seen foci, compared normal liver, term enzymatically hyperactive focus (EHF) proposed type lesion. stage overtly nodular growth lesions exhibit characteristic changes seen nodules developing glycogenotic foci, namely elevated activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transferase glutathione-S-transferase P well decreased activities adenosine-triphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase adenylate cyclase. enzymes used widely morphometric studies markers preneoplastic neoplastic lesions. inability detect early EHF may lead underestimation preneoplastic liver lesions quantitative studies. Although apparent differences histochemical patterns glycogen storing foci early EHF, differences tend disappear progression overtly neoplastic lesions. studies comparing phenotypic alterations different types preneoplastic hepatic lesions, recognition EHF may contribute distinction obligatory facultative phenomena transformation.
