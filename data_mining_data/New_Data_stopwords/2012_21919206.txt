 T-cell vaccination (TCV), application irradiated activated cells, shown prevent effectively treat experimental autoimmune diseases. reported anti-lymphocytic antibodies induced TCV capable strongly inhibiting T-cell proliferation ameliorating experimental autoimmune disease. present study undertaken characterize antigen specificity Abs. used activated mouse ovalbumin (OVA)-specific cells (OVA-T) vaccine immunized mice. combination 2-DE, 2-D Western blot Q-TOF mass spectrometry identified 11 antigens activated cells recognized anti-T-cell Abs. resulting antigenic molecules included calreticulin (CRT), ERp57, Vimentin, HSP70-4, tubulin beta5 chain, coronin-1A, pyruvate kinase, ATP synthase beta chain transketolase belong so-called damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). CRT, ERp57 vementin examined Western blot cellular ELISA identify molecular targets may involved TCV immunotherapy. basis results, gamma-radiation induced activated cells "immunogenic apoptosis" exposed/secreted DAMPs (CRT, ERp57 Vementin) played important role TCV therapy.
