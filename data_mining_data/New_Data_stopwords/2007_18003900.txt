 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA), compound generated tryptophan metabolism initiated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, known induce cell death, molecular target known. report HAA inhibits NF-kappaB activation upon cell antigen receptor engagement specifically targeting PDK1. Inhibition NF-kappaB HAA leads dysfunction cell death activated Th2 cells, turn suppresses experimental asthma. Inhibition NF-kappaB induction apoptosis specific CD4 cells HAA inhibit NF-kappaB activation induce cell death upon Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation dendritic cells. Thus, HAA natural inhibitor restrains cell expansion activation.
