 BACKGROUND: Optimal cytoreduction major prognostic factor ovarian cancer; several clinical, radiological biochemical predictors studied. Tumour M2-PK (TU M2-PK) over-expressed tumour cells detected plasma samples role ovarian cancer yet evaluated. OBJECTIVES: assess potential clinical applications TU M2-PK ovarian cancer particularly relation surgical cytoreduction. SETTINGS: Gynaecological Cancer Centre King's College St Thomas' Hospitals; London; UK. METHODS: Patients suspected ovarian cancer recruited prospectively years 2004-2005. Blood samples collected surgery plasma TU M2-PK assays. Data analysed relation cancer diagnosis outcome. Statistical analysis performed using Analyse-It' SPSS' V13. RESULTS: 100 patients recruited; 52 diagnosed invasive ovarian cancer, 13 borderline tumours 35 patients benign conditions. mean M2-PK concentration cancer patients 52 U/ml vs 31 U/ml patients borderline tumours 22 U/ml benign conditions (p < 0.001); significantly raised association late stage disease higher grade (p < 0.05). Taking 35 U/ml reference point, TU M2-PK predicted sub-optimal cytoreduction advanced stage disease sensitivity 69%, specificity 60% overall efficacy 61% (95% CI: 44-75%). CONCLUSION: TU M2-PK significantly raised ovarian cancer patients, particularly higher stage disease. potential clinical application predictor surgical outcome ovarian cancer needs evaluation.
