 contrast performing assays substrate using immobilization techniques, wet analysis nanoliter-sized wells allows quantitative monitoring enzyme-based reactions measuring luminescence time. However, suitable dispensing method required accurately deposit stabilized enzyme solutions nanoliter wells manner enzyme activities preserved prior measurements. Furthermore, efficient method required add sample liquid wells manner evaporation assay liquid completely prevented sample introduction monitoring. powerful methodology presented paper allowing quantitative analysis enzyme-based reactions identical nanoliter volumes on-chip. first step, picoliter amounts protein solutions deposited uniform dry dots wells using reported electrospraying technique (Moerman, R.; Frank, J.; Marijnissen, J. C. M.; Schalkhammer, T. G. M.; van Dedem, G. W. K. Anal. Chem. 2001, 73, 2183-2189.). silicon chips stored temperatures low -80 degrees C. time analysis, sample solution slid wells using coverslip. edge coverslip, sample solution pushed across wells speed 1.5-2.5 cm/s prevent carryover reagents neighboring wells. Evaporation assay liquid wells prevented coverslip seals wells "bonds" chip adhesion forces. Electrospraying appears excellent method deposit enzyme solutions containing 20% (w/v) trehalose without hampered clogging capillary splashing droplets. sprayed on-chip (silicon nitride), enzymes pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase remained stable period 1.5-2 months storage temperature -20 degrees C. coverslip method completely prevented evaporation minutes hours allowing monitoring enzyme-based reactions arrays nanoliter wells.
