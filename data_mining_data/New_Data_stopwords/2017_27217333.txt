 well established increased liver cancer incidence strongly associated epigenetic silencing tumor suppressor genes; latter contributed environmental exposure arsenic. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mitochondrial protein regulates TCA cycle. However, epigenetic mechanisms mediated arsenic control PDK4 expression remain elusive. present study, showed histone methyltransferase G9a- Suv39H-mediated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylations contributed PDK4 silencing hepatic cells. PDK4 expression induced G9a inhibitor BRD4770 (BRD) Suv39H inhibitor Chaetocin (CHA). contrast, arsenic exposure decreased PDK4 expression inducing G9a increasing H3K9 di- tri-methylations levels (H3K9me2/3). addition, arsenic exposure antagonizes effect BRD enhancing enrichment H3K9me2/3 PKD4 promoter. Moreover, knockdown G9a using siRNA induced PDK4 expression HCC cells. Furthermore, arsenic decreased hepatic PDK4 expression well diminished induction PDK4 BRD mouse liver hepatocytes. Overall, results suggest arsenic causes aberrant repressive histone modification silence PDK4 HCC cells mouse liver.
