 effects iron (Fe) deficiency low-molecular-weight organic acid (LMWOA) metabolism investigated Carrizo citrange (CC) [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] roots. Major LMWOAs found roots, xylem sap root exudates citrate malate concentrations increased Fe deficiency. activities several enzymes involved LMWOA metabolism also assessed roots. cytosolic fraction, activities malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) enzymes 132 100% higher Fe-deficient conditions, whereas activity pyruvate kinase 31% lower activity malic enzyme (ME) change. mitochondrial fraction, activities fumarase, MDH citrate synthase enzymes 158, 117 53% higher, respectively, Fe-deficient extracts compared Fe-sufficient controls, whereas significant differences treatments found aconitase (ACO) activity. expression corresponding genes roots Fe-deficient plants higher measured Fe-sufficient controls, except ACO ME. Also, dicarboxylate-tricarboxylate carrier (DTC) expression significantly increased Fe-deficient roots. conclusion, Fe deficiency CC seedlings causes reprogramming carbon metabolism involves increase anaplerotic fixation carbon via PEPC MDH activities cytosol shift Krebs cycle mitochondria towards non-cyclic mode, previously described herbaceous species. scheme, DTC could play important role shuttling malate reducing equivalents cytosol mitochondria. result metabolic switch malate citrate concentrations roots, xylem sap root exudates increase.
