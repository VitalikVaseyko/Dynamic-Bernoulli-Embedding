 Pyruvate acetyl-CoA form backbone central metabolism. nonoxidative cleavage pyruvate acetyl-CoA formate glycyl radical enzyme pyruvate formate lyase one signature reactions mixed-acid fermentation enterobacteria. conditions, formic acid accounts one-third carbon derived glucose. metabolism acetyl-CoA acetate via acetyl-phosphate catalyzed phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase exemplar substrate-level phosphorylation. Acetyl-CoA also used acceptor reducing equivalents generated glycolysis, whereby ethanol formed polymeric acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE) enzyme. metabolism acetyl-CoA via either acetate ethanol branches governed cellular demand ATP necessity reoxidize NADH. Consequently, absence electron acceptor mutants lacking either branch acetyl-CoA metabolism fail cleave pyruvate, despite presence PFL, instead reduce D-lactate D-lactate dehydrogenase. conversion PFL active, radical-bearing species controlled radical-SAM enzyme, PFL-activase. reactions regulated response prevalent cellular NADH:NAD+ ratio. contrast Escherichia coli Salmonella species, genera enterobacteria, e.g., Klebsiella Enterobacter, produce neutral product 2,3-butanediol considerable amounts CO2 fermentation products. bacteria, two molecules pyruvate converted alpha-acetolactate (AL) alpha-acetolactate synthase (ALS). AL decarboxylated subsequently reduced product 2,3-butandiol.
