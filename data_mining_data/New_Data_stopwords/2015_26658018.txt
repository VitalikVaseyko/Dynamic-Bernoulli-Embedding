 developed model system investigate apoptotic resistance cells using osmotic stress (OS) drive selection death-resistant cells. Exposure S49 (Neo) cells multiple rounds OS followed recovery surviving cells resulted selection population cells (S49 (OS 4-25)) failed die response variety intrinsic apoptotic stimuli including acute OS, remained sensitive extrinsic apoptotic initiators. Genome-wide microarray analysis comparing S49 (OS 4-25) parent S49 (Neo) cells revealed 8500 differentially regulated genes, almost 90% identified repressed. Surprisingly, data revealed apoptotic resistance associated expected changes pro- antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member genes. Rather, cells lack several characteristics associated initial signaling activation intrinsic apoptosis pathway, including failure increase mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, failure increase intracellular calcium, failure deplete glutathione, failure release cytochrome c mitochondria, along lack induced caspase activity. S49 (OS 4-25) cells exhibit metabolic characteristics indicative Warburg effect, and, despite numerous changes mitochondria gene expression, mitochondria normal metabolic capacity. Interestingly, S49 (OS 4-25) cells developed complete dependence glucose survival, glucose withdrawal results cell death many essential characteristics apoptosis. Furthermore, show dietary sugars galactose support viability S49 (OS 4-25) cells absence glucose; however, carbon source sensitizes cells die. findings suggest carbon substrate reprogramming energy production S49 (OS 4-25) cells results stimulus-specific recognition defects activation intrinsic apoptotic pathways.
