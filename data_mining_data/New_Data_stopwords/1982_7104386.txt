 1. Glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol phenylephrine increases significantly glucose appearance glycogen disappearance hepatocytes juvenile adult fed rabbits. increases caused catecholamines adrenergic agonists suppressed significantly beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol unchanged alpha-antagonist phentolamine. 2. Glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol phenylephrine increases significantly glycogen phosphorylase activity decreases significantly pyruvate kinase activity ratio (assayed 0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate +/- 200 microM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) hepatocytes juvenile adult rabbits. Changes induced catecholamines adrenergic agonists activities enzymes significantly diminished propranolol unaltered phentolamine. 3. observations suggest regulation glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis rabbits glucagon catecholamines least partially due activation glycogen phosphorylase inhibition pyruvate kinase. Contrary age-related changes observed adrenergic nature catecholamines' regulation two processes rats, regulation processes catecholamines beta-adrenergic rabbits regardless age.
