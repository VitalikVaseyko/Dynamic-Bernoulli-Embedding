 effect tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), differentiation marker expression skeletal myotubes immediate progenitors, presumptive myoblasts (PMbs), investigated. markers employed included K-isozyme pyruvate kinase (PK-K) newly characterized phosphoprotein (pp(65;4.5)), normally concentrated PMbs, M-isozyme pyruvate kinase (PK-M) phosphorylated derivatives alpha- beta-tropomyosin (pT), normally concentrated myotubes. PMbs treated TPA 3, 6 10 days continued express PK-K pp(65;4.5), express PK-M pT detectable levels. Myotubes treated 3 6 days inhibited expression PK-M pT, stimulated expression PK-K pp(65;4.5). effects TPA reversible upon discontinuation treatment. parallel experiments, pp(65;4.5) pT monitored, infection Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) similar effects. data suggest TPA treatment RSV transformation alter state differentiation target cells per se but, case myotubes, suppress expression state.
