 5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR) known stimulate rat liver 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK mammalian homologue Snf1p yeast, involved derepression glucose-repressed genes. used AICAR test AMPK could also play role regulation glucose-dependent genes mammalian cells. concentration induces phosphorylation-dependent inactivation HMG-CoA reductase, AICAR blocked glucose activation three glucose responsive genes, namely L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), Spot 14 fatty acid synthase genes primary cultured hepatocytes, without action glucose phosphorylation glucose 6-phosphate expression PEPCK, albumin beta-actin genes. AICAR also found inhibit activation L-PK gene promoter glucose transiently transfected hepatoma cells. Therefore results suggest AMPK probably involved glucose signal pathway regulating gene expression liver.
