 Oxidative stress serves important regulator apoptosis metabolic reprogramming tumor cells. Chaetocin, histone methyltransferase inhibitor, known induce ROS generation. elevating basal ROS level sensitizes glioma cells apoptosis, ability Chaetocin regulating apoptotic metabolic adaptive responses glioma investigated. Chaetocin induced glioma cell apoptosis ROS-dependent manner. Increased intracellular ROS induced (i) Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) expression independent canonical Hippo pathway well (ii) ATM JNK activation. Increased interaction YAP1 p73 p300 induced apoptosis ATM-dependent manner. Chaetocin induced JNK modulated several metabolic parameters like glucose uptake, lactate production, ATP generation, activity glycolytic enzymes hexokinase pyruvate kinase. However, JNK effect ATM YAP1 expression. Coherent vitro findings, Chaetocin reduced tumor burden heterotypic xenograft glioma mouse model. Chaetocin-treated tumors exhibited heightened ROS, pATM, YAP1 pJNK levels. study highlights coordinated control glioma cell proliferation metabolism ROS (i) ATM-YAP1-driven apoptotic pathway (ii) JNK-regulated metabolic adaptation. elucidation newfound connections roles played ROS simultaneously shift metabolic program induce apoptosis could provide insights toward development new anti-glioma strategies.
