 Although ancillary pathways glucose metabolism critical synthesizing cellular building blocks modulating stress responses, regulated remains unclear. present study, used radiometric glycolysis assays, [(13)C6]-glucose isotope tracing, extracellular flux analysis understand phosphofructokinase (PFK)-mediated changes glycolysis regulate glucose carbon partitioning catabolic anabolic pathways. Expression kinase-deficient phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase rat neonatal cardiomyocytes co-ordinately regulated glycolytic rate lactate production. Nevertheless, groups, >40% glucose consumed cells unaccounted via catabolism pyruvate, suggests entry glucose carbons ancillary pathways branching metabolites formed preparatory phase glycolysis. Analysis (13)C fractional enrichment patterns suggests PFK activity regulates glucose carbon incorporation directly ribose glycerol moieties purines phospholipids, respectively. Pyrimidines, UDP-N-acetylhexosamine, fatty acyl chains phosphatidylinositol triglycerides showed lower (13)C incorporation conditions high PFK activity; isotopologue (13)C enrichment pattern metabolite indicated limitations mitochondria-engendered aspartate, acetyl CoA fatty acids. Consistent notion, high glycolytic rate diminished mitochondrial activity coupling glycolysis glucose oxidation. findings suggest major portion intracellular glucose cardiac myocytes apportioned ancillary biosynthetic reactions PFK co-ordinates activities pentose phosphate, hexosamine biosynthetic, glycerolipid synthesis pathways directly modulating glycolytic intermediate entry auxiliary glucose metabolism pathways indirectly regulating mitochondrial cataplerosis.
