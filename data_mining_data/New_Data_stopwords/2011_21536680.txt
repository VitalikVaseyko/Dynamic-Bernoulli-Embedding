 Warburg effect hallmark cancer manifested continuous prevalence glycolysis dysregulation oxidative metabolism. Glycolysis provides survival advantage cancer cells. investigate molecular mechanisms underlying Warburg effect, first compared oxygen consumption among hFOB osteoblasts, benign osteosarcoma cells, Saos2, aggressive osteosarcoma cells, 143B. demonstrate that, proliferation invasiveness increase osteosarcoma, cells utilize significantly less oxygen. proceeded evaluate mitochondrial morphology function. Electron microscopy showed 143B cells, mitochondria enlarged increase number. Quantitative PCR revealed increase mtDNA 143B cells compared hFOB Saos2 cells. Gene expression studies showed mitochondrial single-strand DNA-binding protein (mtSSB), key catalyst mitochondrial replication, significantly up-regulated 143B cells. addition, increased levels mitochondrial respiratory complexes accompanied significant reduction activities. changes indicate hyperactive mitochondrial replication 143B cells. Forced overexpression mtSSB Saos2 cells caused increase mtDNA decrease oxygen consumption. contrast, knockdown mtSSB 143B cells accompanied decrease mtDNA, increase oxygen consumption, retardation cell growth vitro vivo. summary, found mitochondrial dysfunction cancer cells correlates abnormally increased mitochondrial replication, according gain- loss-of-function experiments, may due overexpression mtSSB. study provides insight mechanisms mitochondrial dysfunction cancer may offer potential therapeutic targets.
