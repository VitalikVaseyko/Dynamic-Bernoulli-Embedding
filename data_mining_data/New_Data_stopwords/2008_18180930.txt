 Carbon flux Xenopus laevis oocyte glycogenic endogenous monocarboxylate transporter responsible intracellular lactate uptake. aim present study determine direct activation protein kinases C modulates activity lactate transporter, well investigate possible role cytoskeleton regulatory phenomena. modulation studied isolated Xenopus oocytes stage V-VI measuring (14)C-lactate uptake, absence presence cytoskeletal-perturbing toxins. found basal lactate transporter activity depends integrity cytoskeleton since partially inhibited cytoskeleton disorganisation. PKA PKC activation caused significant decrease transport activity decrease could blocked specific protein kinase inhibitors. evidenced effects additive. Transport inhibition annulled agents destabilize actin filaments microtubules. conclude protein kinases C, whose effects mediated cytoskeleton, negatively regulate endogenous lactate transporter Xenopus oocyte, suggesting kinases may role control cytosolic pyruvate/lactate pool oocyte.
