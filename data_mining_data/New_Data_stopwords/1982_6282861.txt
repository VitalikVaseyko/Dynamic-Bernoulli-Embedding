 alpha subunit sodium channel purified rat brain rapidly selectively phosphorylated catalytic subunit cAMP-dependent protein kinase level 3 4 mol 32P/mol saxitoxin-binding activity. rate phosphorylation comparable synthetic peptide analog phosphorylation site pyruvate kinase, one best substrates cAMP-dependent protein kinase. endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase present partially purified sodium channel preparations also selectively phosphorylates alpha subunit. specificity rapidity phosphorylation reaction consistent hypothesis alpha subunit phosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase vivo.
