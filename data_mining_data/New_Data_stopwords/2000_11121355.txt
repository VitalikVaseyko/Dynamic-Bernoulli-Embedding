 suggested activity anaerobic enzymes white muscle fish increases exponentially body size meet increasing hydrodynamic costs burst swimming. tested whether relationship holds across large size range striped bass, spanning nearly 3,000-fold range body mass. examined scaling marker enzymes anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase) aerobic (citrate synthase malate dehydrogenase) metabolism red white locomotor muscles. white muscle, found positive scaling anaerobic enzymes smaller fishes. Positive scaling anaerobic enzymes found among samples included fishes >1,000 g despite sufficiently large sample size detect scaling. absence positive scaling white muscles large bass suggests unable generate sufficient power sustain relative burst swimming performance. Enzymes aerobic pathways activities mass independent red white muscle. Red white muscles metabolically distinct except among smallest fishes. Among young year, anaerobic capacity red muscle approached white muscle also showed positive scaling. unusual pattern suggests red muscle might augment white muscle burst swimming add total power generated small fish. Maximizing burst swimming performance may critical small fishes vulnerable predation unimportant large fishes.
