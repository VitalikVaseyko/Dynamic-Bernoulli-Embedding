 BACKGROUND: Malignant tumor cells typically metabolize glucose anaerobically lactic acid even normal oxygen tension, phenomenon called aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect. results increased acid production acidification extracellular microenvironment solid tumors. H(+) ions tend flow along concentration gradients peritumoral normal tissue causing extracellular matrix degradation increased tumor cell motility thus promoting invasion metastasis. shown reducing acidity sodium bicarbonate buffer decreases metastatic fitness circulating tumor cells prostate cancer cancer models. Mathematical models tumor-host dynamics predicted buffers pka around 7 effective reducing intra- peri-tumoral acidosis and, thus, possibly effective inhibiting tumor metastasis sodium bicarbonate pKa around 6. test prediction efficacy free base lysine; non-bicarbonate/non-volatile buffer higher pKa (~10), prostate tumor metastases model. METHODS: Oxygen consumption acid production rate PC3M prostate cancer cells normal prostate cells determined using Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XF-96) analyzer. vivo effect 200 mM lysine started four days prior inoculation inhibition metastasis examined PC3M-LUC-C6 prostate cancer model using SCID mice. Metastases followed bioluminescence imaging. RESULTS: PC3M prostate cancer cells highly acidic comparison normal prostate cell line indicating reduction intra- perit-tumoral acidosis inhibit metastases formation. vivo administration 200 mM free base lysine increased survival reduced metastasis. CONCLUSION: PC3M prostate cancer cells highly glycolytic produce large amounts acid compared normal prostate cells. Administration non-volatile buffer decreased growth metastases improved survival indicating acidity plays significant role growth invasion in-vivo.
