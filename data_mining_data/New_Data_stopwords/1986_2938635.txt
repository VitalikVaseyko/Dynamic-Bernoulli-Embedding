 Selected glycolytic enzymes (including phosphoglucose isomerase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase), well glycogen phosphorylase, creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, bound phosphofructokinase immobilized agarose gel. affinity phosphofructokinase various proteins differed, phosphorylase exhibiting strongest binding. Binding reversed either by: (1) elution high-ionic-strength buffer (0.4 KCl); (2) addition 5-10 mM concentration ATP; (3) high concentrations fructose 6-phosphate (5 mM).
