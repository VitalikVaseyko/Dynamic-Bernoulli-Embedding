 right heart functionally structurally different left heart; however, potential differences Akt signaling expression metabolic genes right heart left heart different rodents still unknown. Using Western blotting real time quantification polymerase chain reaction, measured levels total Akt, phosphorylated Akt downstream targets well metabolism genes including glucose transporter 1, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4. found phosphorylated Akt proline-rich Akt substrate 40 levels significantly increased RV compared LV rats increased trend mice. Correspondingly, GLUT4 significantly increased RV compared LV mice rats. PGC-1alpha significantly increased RV compared LV mice increased trend rats. Moreover, Akt signaling activity metabolism genes' expression IVS similar RV mice LV rats. differences activity Akt signaling levels metabolism genes among right ventricle, interventricular septum left ventricle. Also, diversity activity Akt metabolism genes right ventricle left ventricle different rats mice. conclusion, activity Akt signaling levels metabolism genes different among right ventricle, interventricular septum left ventricle providing potential clues exploring roles Akt signaling cardiac metabolisms different parts heart. Additionally, differences Akt activity metabolism genes' levels right left ventricles different mice rats, pay attention using different animal model heart study.
