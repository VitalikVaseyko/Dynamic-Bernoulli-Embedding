 Metabolic reprogramming facilitates cancer cell growth, quantitative metabolic flux measurements could produce useful biomarkers. However, current methods analyze flux vivo provide either steady-state overview relative activities (infusion (13)C analysis extracted metabolites) dynamic view reactions (hyperpolarized (13)C spectroscopy). Moreover, although hyperpolarization successfully quantified pyruvate-lactate exchanges, ability assess mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism unproven cancer. Here, combined (13)C hyperpolarization isotopomer analysis quantify multiple fates pyruvate simultaneously. Two cancer cell lines divergent pyruvate metabolism incubated thermally polarized [3-(13)C]pyruvate several hours, briefly exposed hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate acquisition NMR spectra using selective excitation maximize detection H[(13)C]O3(-) [1-(13)C]lactate. Metabolites extracted subjected isotopomer analysis determine relative rates pathways involving [3-(13)C]pyruvate. Quantitation hyperpolarized H[(13)C]O3(-) provided single definitive metabolic rate, used convert relative rates derived isotopomer analysis quantitative fluxes. revealed H[(13)C]O3(-) appearance reflects activity pyruvate dehydrogenase rather pyruvate carboxylation followed subsequent decarboxylation reactions. Glucose substantially altered [1-(13)C]pyruvate metabolism, enhancing exchanges [1-(13)C]lactate suppressing H[(13)C]O3(-) formation. Furthermore, inhibiting Akt, oncogenic kinase stimulates glycolysis, reversed effects, indicating metabolism pyruvate LDH pyruvate dehydrogenase subject acute effects oncogenic signaling glycolysis. data suggest combining (13)C isotopomer analyses dynamic hyperpolarized (13)C spectroscopy may enable quantitative flux measurements living tumors.
