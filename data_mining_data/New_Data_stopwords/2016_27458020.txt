 Non-proliferating cells oxidize respiratory substrates mitochondria generate protonmotive force (Deltap) drives ATP synthesis. mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi), component Deltap, drives release mitochondrial ATP(4-) exchange cytosolic ADP(3-) via electrogenic adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) located mitochondrial inner membrane, leads high cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio >100-fold greater matrix ATP/ADP. rat hepatocytes, ANT inhibitors, bongkrekic acid (BA), carboxyatractyloside (CAT), F1FO-ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin (OLIG), inhibited ureagenesis-induced respiration. However, several cancer cell lines, OLIG BA CAT inhibited respiration. hepatocytes, respiratory inhibition collapse DeltaPsi OLIG, BA, CAT added. Similarly, cancer cells OLIG 2-deoxyglucose, glycolytic inhibitor, depolarized mitochondria respiratory inhibition, showed mitochondrial hydrolysis glycolytic ATP maintained DeltaPsi absence respiration cell types studied. However cancer cells, BA, CAT, knockdown major ANT isoforms, ANT2 ANT3, collapse DeltaPsi respiratory inhibition. findings indicated ANT mediating mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchange cancer cells [corrected]. propose suppression ANT contributes low cytosolic ATP/ADP, activation glycolysis, Warburg metabolic phenotype proliferating cells.
