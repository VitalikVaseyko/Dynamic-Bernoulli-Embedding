 Ultrastructural biochemical studies conducted livers chick embryos maintained shell-less culture stage 39 (Hamburger-Hamilton) control embryos developed ovo stage. ultrastructural characteristics hepatic cells cultured embryos similar found controls except contained many large lipid droplets almost devoid lipoprotein granules normally associated Golgi complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum. changes suggest existence alterations lipid metabolism. livers cultured embryos showed also decreased incorporation tritiated leucine proteins, indicates reduced rate protein synthesis. results consistent previous reports showing cultured embryos possess hypoproteinemia. Lactic dehydrogenase activity similar pyruvic kinase higher livers cultured respect control embryos. appears indicate aerobic anaerobic glycolysis depressed changes observed rate protein synthesis attributed hypoxia. "Fat-storing cells" similar described mammals found control cultured embryos. previously described livers chick embryos.
