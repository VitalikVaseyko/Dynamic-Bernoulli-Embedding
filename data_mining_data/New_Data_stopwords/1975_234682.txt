 activity enzymes involved glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipoenesis early term human placenta determined. high activity pyruvate kinase found, indicating high glycolytic potential. activity enzyme tended decrease gestation. presence phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity detected, suggesting possibility gluconeogenesis placenta. low activity enzymes involved fatty acid synthesis found, whereas activity pentose shunt pathway enzymes, glucose-6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, relatively high. suggested role pathway synthesis lipids fatty acids placenta. activities enzymes human placenta changes gestation compared previous observations enzymes rat placenta.
