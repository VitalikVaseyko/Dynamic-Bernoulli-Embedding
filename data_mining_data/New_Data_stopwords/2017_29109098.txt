 BACKGROUND/AIM: According reverse Warburg effect, tumor cells may metabolize lactate energy source shuttle L-lactate neighboring cancer cells, adjacent stroma, vascular endothelial cells, thus inducing metabolic reprogramming. increased tumor L-lactate level strictly correlates increased metastasis, tumor recurrence poor outcome. potent anticancer agent may act L-lactate activated cells 2-metoxyestradiol. Thus, aim study evaluate whether potent anticancer agent, 2-methoxyestradiol, able reverse L-lactate-induced metabolic reprogramming osteosarcoma 143B cells. MATERIALS METHODS: used flow cytometry order determine cell death, autophagy, expression KI-67, mitochondrial membrane depolarization. performed cell proliferation assay order determine cell viability cell migration assay determine invasive potential osteosarcoma cells. While, CalcuSyn software used order evaluate interaction 2-methoxyestradiol L-lactate. RESULTS: demonstrated 2-methoxyestradiol abolished L-lactate-induced migration proliferation osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, observed effect associated regulation Ki-67 induction autophagy. CONCLUSION: 2-Methoxyestradiol potent anticancer agent also metabolic reprogramming conditions.
