 glycogen storage disorder (gsd/gsd) rat little phosphorylase kinase activity liver unable break liver glycogen fasting. Nevertheless, gsd/gsd rats become hypoglycaemic fasting. Gsd/gsd rats showed decreased rate glucose turnover measured [6-3H]glucose. Perfused livers gsd/gsd rats showed decreased rates gluconeogenesis lactate alanine results expressed per gram liver, total glucose produced per liver normal. Measurement gluconeogenesis vivo using [14C]-bicarbonate showed gsd/gsd rats decreased rate glucose production substrates enter gluconeogenic pathway pyruvate. conclude gsd/gsd rats adapted unavailability liver glycogen decreasing peripheral uptake glucose increasing gluconeogenesis.
