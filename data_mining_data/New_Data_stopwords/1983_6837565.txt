 metabolic defect pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK(-)) accelerates red blood cell (RBC) destruction established, may related RBC membrane abnormalities associated altered cellular metabolism. Furthermore, shown PK(-) reticulocytes especially sensitive metabolic depletion. Therefore, compared membranes reticulocyte-rich PK(-) RBC, fresh ATP depleted, membranes fresh ATP depleted normal mature RBC reticulocytes. difference specific gravity (SG) membranes normal mature RBC (SG 1.152 +/- 0.004) membranes reticulocyte-rich RBC several anemias (SG 1.150 +/- 0.002). However, membranes fresh, reticulocyte-rich PK(-) RBC dense SG 1.165 +/- 0.004 correlated corresponding increase protein lipid phosphorus ratio 66 +/- 8 micrograms protein/micrograms lipid phosphorus (normal 52 +/- 6 micrograms/micrograms). membrane density PK(-) RBC increased PK(-) RBC ATP depleted anaerobic incubation (SG 1.188 +/- 0.004) cyanide inhibition (SG 1.182 +/- 0.001). ATP depleted normal RBC non-PK(-) reticulocytes, corresponding increases membrane SG occurred. distinctive 50,000 MW peptide adsorbed cytoplasm membranes reticulocytes (both normal PK(-) cells depleted ATP. increased membrane adsorption cytoplasmic proteins PK(-) RBC associated increased RBC calcium uptake, sulfhydryl oxidation, altered membrane protein phosphorylation. observed abnormalities PK(-) RBC membranes could reproduced ATP depletion reticulocyte-enriched non-PK(-) RBC.
