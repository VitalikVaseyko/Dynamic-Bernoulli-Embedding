 Syntheny localization following genes common shrew Sorex araneus determined: isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2), glutamine--pyruvate--oxo-acid transaminase (GPT), inorganic pyrophosphatase (PP) chromosome ik; adenylate kinases 1 3 (AK1 AK3) chromosome af; enolase 1 (ENO1) chromosome jl. Two genes assigned definite arms: aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) arm p chromosome mp glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1) arm q chromosome qr. Thus, 26 genes marking eight ten chromosomes present cytogenetic map common shrew. include previously described localizations.
