 lymphocytes rat, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase NADP+-linked malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) distributed almost exclusively cytosol whereas pyruvate carboxylase distributed almost entirely mitochondria. NAD+-linked malate dehydrogenase aspartate aminotransferase approximately 80% 40%, respectively, cytosolic compartment. Since glutaminase present mitochondria, glutamine converted malate within mitochondria metabolism malate likely occur cytosol. Hence pyruvate produced malate, via oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, may rapidly converted lactate, restricting entry pyruvate mitochondria explaining little glutamine completely oxidised cells despite high capacity Krebs cycle.
