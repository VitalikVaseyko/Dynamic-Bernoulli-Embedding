 paper reports results gossypol effects testicular mitochondrial ultrastructures functions. hypothesis mechanism gossypol action based experimental data postulated. Electron microscopic observations confirmed previous studies mitochondria target germ cells sensitive severely damaged among cellular organelles response gossypol. damages included swelling, vacuolation, crista depletion, lysis, granular accumulation matrix process intact mitochondria disintegration. activity mitochondrial marker enzyme, LDH-X human spermatozoa, markedly decreased suppressed completely gossypol treatment. functions isolated testicular mitochondria determined Warburg manometric oxygen electrode polarographic methods indicated gossypol stimulated respiration inhibited slightly oxidative phosphorylation low concentrations (20-40 microM) vitro. increase concentration gossypol, mitochondrial respiration phosphorylation decreased obviously, completely inhibited concentration 80 microM oxidative phosphorylation 300 microM respiration. degree uncoupling phosphorylation appears dose-dependent. Similar results obtained testicular mitochondria isolated rats administered per os gossypol previously (6 mg, 10 mg 15 mg/day X 21 respectively), P/0 ratio decreased significantly (P less 0.001) compared control group. distribution 14C-gossypol mitochondrial found 2-3 times higher subcellular fractions. Similar pattern distribution shown double labeling experiments 14C-gossypol 3H-ouabain.
