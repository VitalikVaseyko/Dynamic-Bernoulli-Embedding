 analyzed structural determinants allosteric activation yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK) mutational kinetic analysis initiated structure-based design project identify novel effectors modulate allosteric response binding allosteric site fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). wild-type enzyme strongly activated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate weakly activated fructose-1-phosphate fructose-6-phosphate; strength activation response proportional affinity allosteric effector. point mutation within 6'-phosphate binding loop allosteric site (T403E) abolishes activation enzyme fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate. mutant enzyme also activated F1P F6P. mutation alone (which incorporates glutamic acid strictly conserved mammalian M1 isozymes) slightly reduces cooperativity substrate binding. Three novel compounds identified effect allosteric regulation YPK FBP and/or act novel allosteric activators enzyme. One physiologically important diphospho sugar, two hydrophobic compounds dissimilar natural effector. results demonstrate novel allosteric effectors may identified using structure-based screening indicative potential strategy drug discovery. Regulatory sites generally divergent catalytic sites therefore offer excellent opportunities discrimination specificity different organisms different tissue types.
