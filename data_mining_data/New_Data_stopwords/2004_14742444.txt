 expression genes encoding enzymes involved de novo triglyceride synthesis (lipogenesis) transcriptionally induced liver response increased glucose metabolism. carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) newly identified basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor proposed regulate expression glucose-responsive gene pyruvate kinase. gene contains carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) consisting two E box motifs separated 5 bp necessary sufficient glucose regulation. demonstrate overexpression ChREBP primary rat hepatocytes activates ChoRE-containing promoters manner consistent ability respond glucose. vitro binding ChREBP ChoRE sequences detected. E box-binding proteins function obligate dimers, performed yeast two-hybrid screen mouse liver cDNA library identify potential heteromeric partners. Mlx (Max-like protein X) selected basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper interaction partner screen. plasmid expressing either Mlx ChREBP cotransfected ChoRE-containing reporter plasmid human embryonic kidney 293 cells, increase promoter activity observed. However, expression proteins dramatically enhanced promoter activity. activation observed reporters containing ChoREs several different lipogenic enzyme genes. contrast, reporters containing non-glucose-responsive E box elements activated ChREBP-Mlx expression. vitro binding ChREBP ChoRE-containing oligonucleotides observed presence Mlx. ChREBP-Mlx binding discriminated E box sites glucose-responsive not. conclude Mlx functional heteromeric partner ChREBP regulating expression glucose-responsive genes.
