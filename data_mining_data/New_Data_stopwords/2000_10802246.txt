 activity mRNA level hepatic enzymes fatty acid oxidation synthesis compared rats fed diets containing either 15% saturated fat (palm oil), safflower oil rich linoleic acid, perilla oil rich alpha-linolenic acid fish oil rich eicosapentaenoic (EPA) docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) 15 days. mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation rate 50% higher rats fed perilla fish oils groups. Perilla fish oils compared palm safflower oils approximately doubled tripled, respectively, peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation rate. Compared palm safflower oil, perilla fish oils caused 50% increase carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity. Dietary fats rich n-3 fatty acids also increased activity fatty acid oxidation enzymes except 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. extent increase greater fish oil perilla oil. Interestingly, perilla fish oils decreased activity 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase measured using short- medium-chain substrates. Compared palm safflower oils, perilla fish oils increased mRNA level many mitochondrial peroxisomal enzymes. Increases generally greater fish oil perilla oil. Fatty acid synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase activity mRNA level higher rats fed palm oil groups. Among rats fed polyunsaturated fats, activities mRNA levels enzymes lower rats fed fish oil animals fed perilla safflower oils. values comparable latter two groups. Safflower fish oils perilla oil, compared palm oil, also decreased malic enzyme activity mRNA level. Examination fatty acid composition hepatic phospholipid indicated dietary alpha-linolenic acid effectively desaturated elongated form EPA DHA. Dietary perilla oil fish oil therefore exert similar physiological activity modulating hepatic fatty acid oxidation, dietary fats considerably differ affecting fatty acid synthesis.
