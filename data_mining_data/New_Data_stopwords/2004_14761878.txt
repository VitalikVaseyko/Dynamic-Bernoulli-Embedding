 Changes dietary macronutrient intake alter muscle blood substrate availability important regulating gene expression. However, studies examined effects diet manipulation gene expression human skeletal muscle. aim study quantify extent altering substrate availability impacts subsequent mRNA abundance subset carbohydrate (CHO)- fat-related genes. Seven subjects consumed either low- (LOW; 0.7 g/kg body mass CHO) high- (HIGH; 10 g/kg body mass CHO) CHO diet 48 h performing exhaustive exercise bout deplete muscle glycogen stores. intervention, resting muscle blood samples taken. Muscle analyzed gene abundances GLUT4, glycogenin, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4), fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (beta-HAD), uncoupling binding protein-3 (UCP3), blood samples glucose, insulin, free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. Glycogen-depleting exercise HIGH-CHO resulted 300% increase muscle glycogen content (P < 0.001) relative LOW-CHO condition. FFA concentrations twofold higher LOW- vs. HIGH-CHO (P < 0.05). exercise-diet manipulation exerted significant effect transcription carbohydrate-related genes, increase GLUT4 glycogenin mRNA abundance reduction PDK-4 transcription HIGH-CHO (all P < 0.05). FAT/CD36 (P < 0.05) UCP3 (P < 0.01) gene transcriptions increased following LOW-CHO. conclude 1) rapid capacity short-term exercise diet intervention exert coordinated changes mRNA transcription metabolic related genes, 2) genes involved glucose regulation increased following high-carbohydrate diet.
