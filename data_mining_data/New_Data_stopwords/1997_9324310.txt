 shown previously rat hepatoma FTO-2B cells express two mRNAs, called F (fetal) L (liver), distinct promoters gene coding 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2). enzyme catalyzes synthesis fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, allosteric stimulator glycolysis. found glucose, well lactate pyruvate, increases concentration F L mRNAs. effect glucose mimicked xylitol, precursor xylulose 5-phosphate, hence intermediates pentose phosphate glycolytic pathways, inhibited okadaic acid, inhibitor protein phosphatases. Transfection experiments showed F promoter region target glucose effect, glucose stimulating F promoter activity way probably similar mitogens. Another region gene, located F L promoters, also behaved glucose-sensitive element. region corresponds cluster DNase I-hypersensitive sites induced chromatin following glucose treatment. sequence organization region similar functional architecture glucose-sensitive insulin gene promoter. propose model concerted regulation glucose metabolites three pathways lead increased PFK-2 activity.
