 effect substrate phosphorylation susceptibility proteolytic cleavage trypsin-like enzymes investigated using model heptapeptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly, peptide representing endogenous phosphorylation site pyruvate kinase. Phosphorylation Ser 5 altered kinetics proteolysis two proteases, trypsin rat plasma kallikrein, cleaved Arg 3 Ala 4. case trypsin, phosphorylation decreased rate cleavage 47-fold. case rat plasma kallikrein, phosphorylation decreased proteolysis 13-fold. Phosphorylation resulted apparent redirection preferential site Arg 3 Arg 2. sequences analogous model peptide commonly found exposed domains globular proteins, since regions susceptible phosphorylation protease attack, results indicate substrate phosphorylation may selectively influence protein processing turnover.
