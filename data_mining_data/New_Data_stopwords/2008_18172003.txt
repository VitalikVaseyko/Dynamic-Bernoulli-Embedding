 B-cell-activating factor TNF family, (BAFF), proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) regulate B-lymphocyte survival activation. report BAFF, APRIL, increased chemotactic response primary human B cells CCL21, CXCL12, CXCL13. BAFF-induced increase B-cell chemotaxis totally abolished blockade BAFF-R strongly dependent activation PI3K/AKT, NF-kappaB, p38MAPK pathways. BAFF similar effects chemotaxis naive memory B cells response CCL21 increased strongly memory B cells CXCL13 naive B cells. findings indicate previously unreported role BAFF/BAFF-R pair mature B-cell chemotaxis. synergy CXCL13 BAFF produced stromal cells follicular dendritic cells may important implications B-cell homeostasis, development normal B-cell areas, formation germinal center-like follicles may observed various autoimmune diseases.
