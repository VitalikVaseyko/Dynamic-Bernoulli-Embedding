 S-Adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolases (SAHases) important metabolic enzymes dysregulation associated severe diseases. vivo catalyze hydrolysis S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), by-product methylation reactions various organisms. SAH potent inhibitor methyltransferases, thus removal equilibrium important requirement methylation reactions. SAH hydrolysis also first step cellular regeneration process methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). However, vitro equilibrium lies towards synthetic direction. enable characterization SAHases physiologically relevant direction, developed coupled photometric assay shifts equilibrium towards hydrolysis removing product adenosine, using high affinity adenosine kinase (AK). converts adenosine AMP thereby forms equimolar amounts ADP, phosphorylated pyruvate kinase (PK), turn releasing pyruvate. readout assay consumption NADH lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzed reduction pyruvate lactic acid. applicability assay showcased determination kinetic constants SAHase Bradyrhizobium elkanii (KM,SAH 41+/-5muM, vmax,SAH 25+/-1muM/min 0.13mg/mL enzyme). assay valuable tool vitro characterization SAHases biotechnological potential, monitoring SAHase activity diagnostics.
