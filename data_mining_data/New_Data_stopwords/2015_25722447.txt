 UNLABELLED: purpose study observe effect fasting feeding (18)F-FDG uptake mouse model human non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: vivo studies, (18)F-FDG small-animal PET scans acquired 5 mice bearing non-small cell lung cancer A549 xenografts flank continuous feeding overnight fasting observe changes intratumoral distribution (18)F-FDG tumor (18)F-FDG standardized uptake value (SUV). ex vivo studies, intratumoral spatial (18)F-FDG distribution assessed autoradiography compared tumor microenvironment (including hypoxia pimonidazole stroma hematoxylin eosin stain). Five overnight-fasted mice 5 fed mice A549 tumors observed. RESULTS: Small-animal PET scans obtained fed animals day 1 animals overnight fasting; lapse approximately 14 h. Blood glucose concentration overnight fasting different fed mice (P = 0.42), body weight loss significant overnight fasting (P = 0.001). Intratumoral distribution (18)F-FDG highly heterogeneous tumors examined, change spatial intratumoral distribution (18)F-FDG 2 sets PET images mouse remarkably different mice. Tumor (18)F-FDG mean SUV maximum SUV significantly different fed fasted animals (all P > 0.05, n = 10). tumor mean SUV weakly correlated blood glucose concentration (R(2) = 0.17, P = 0.03). ex vivo studies, fasted mice, spatial colocalization high levels (18)F-FDG uptake pimonidazole-binding hypoxic cancer cells; contrast, pimonidazole-negative normoxic cancer cells noncancerous stroma associated low (18)F-FDG uptake. However, high (18)F-FDG uptake frequently observed noncancerous stroma tumors rarely viable cancer cells tumors fed animals. CONCLUSION: Host dietary status may play key role intratumoral distribution (18)F-FDG. fed animals, (18)F-FDG accumulated predominantly noncancerous stroma tumors, is, reverse Warburg effect. contrast, fasted status, (18)F-FDG uptake found hypoxic cancer cells component (Pasteur effect). findings may provide better understanding competing cancer glucose metabolism hypotheses: Warburg effect, reverse Warburg effect, Pasteur effect.
