 AIM: examine biocontrol activity broad-range antagonists Serratia plymuthica IC1270, Pseudomonas fluorescens Q8r1-96 P. fluorescens B-4117 tumourigenic strains Agrobacterium tumefaciens A. vitis. METHODS RESULTS: greenhouse conditions, antagonists, applied via root soak prior injecting Agrobacterium strains wounded stems, significantly suppressed tumour development tomato seedlings. derivative P. fluorescens Q8r1-96 tagged gfp reporter, well P. fluorescens B-4117 S. plymuthica IC1270 marked rifampicin resistance, stably persisted tomato tissues least 1 month. Mutants P. fluorescens Q8r1-96 S. plymuthica IC1270 deficient 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol pyrrolnitrin production, respectively, also proficiently suppressed tumour development, indicating antibiotics responsible observed biocontrol effect crown gall disease. volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced tested P. fluorescens S. plymuthica strains inhibited growth A. tumefaciens A. vitis strains vitro. Solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) major headspace volatile produced S. plymuthica IC1270; strongly suppressed Agrobacterium growth vitro emitted tomato plants treated S. plymuthica IC1270. 1-Undecene main volatile emitted examined P. fluorescens strains, volatiles, including DMDS, detected relatively low quantities. CONCLUSIONS: S. plymuthica IC1270, P. fluorescens B-4117 P. fluorescens Q8r1-96 used novel biocontrol agents pathogenic Agrobacterium. VOCs, specifically DMDS, might involved suppression oncogenicity tomato plants. However, role specific volatiles biocontrol activity remains elucidated. SIGNIFICANCE IMPACT STUDY: advantage applying antagonists lies multiple activities number plant pathogens, including Agrobacterium.
