 Epigenetic modifications play important roles regulating carcinogenesis, specific epigenetic modifications emerged potential tumor markers. Herein, summarize several types epigenetic modifications, explore role played epigenetic modifications gene regulation, describe patterns epigenetic modifications cancers. Since epigenetic modifications reported regulate Warburg effect cancers, roles epigenetic modifications sugar metabolism discussed. addition, oxidative stress may play important role carcinogenesis, role oxidative stress epigenetic modification carcinogenesis addressed. also discuss role epigenetic modifications therapeutic targets. Finally, synergistic effects combined treatment epigenetic regulator anticancer drugs cancer therapy described.
