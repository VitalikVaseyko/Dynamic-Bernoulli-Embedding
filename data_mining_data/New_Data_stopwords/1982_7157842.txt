 Acetobacter sp. MB 58 assimilates methanol via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate variant hexulose phosphate pathway. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate originates net product assimilation loop involving regeneration C1-acceptor ribulose-5-phosphate must available de novo synthesis C1-acceptor well oxidative glycolysis. made probable regulatory model accomplished via alternating anabolic catabolic phases controlled concerted action PEP-carboxylase pyruvate kinase. Whereas Ac-CoA crucial effector alpha-ketoglutarate aspartate inhibitors PEP-carboxylase, pyruvate kinase assumed regulated energy charge.
