 kinetic expression rat-liver mitochondrial aspartate formation situ developed order determine whether hormonally induced decreases 2-oxoglutarate levels regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis lactate via control aspartate formation. Previous studies laboratory showed 2-oxoglutarate inhibit aspartate production isolated mitochondria. present studies designed probe physiological significance decrease 2-oxoglutarate levels observed Ca2(+)-mobilizing gluconeogenic hormones administered isolate perfused rat livers. First, estimates made kinetic constants determine rate aspartate formation isolated mitochondria. concentrations substrates products process measured perfused livers. values, possible estimate aspartate efflux mitochondria situ. calculated rates aspartate production increased decreases 2-oxoglutarate levels occurred glucagon phenylephrine added perfused livers. Glucagon also effected inhibition pyruvate kinase, evidenced fact calculated rate aspartate efflux equalled rate gluconeogenesis (the difference two equivalent pyruvate-kinase flux). contrast, control livers phenylephrine stimulation, aspartate formation higher gluconeogenesis suggesting significant pyruvate-kinase flux condition. calculations also show correlating increase flux pyruvate carboxylase (30% phenylephrine, 15% glucagon, compared approximately 50% increases gluconeogenic flux). mechanism increase discussed.
