 'Mediterranean' variant glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency due C563CT point mutation, leading replacement Ser Phe position 188, resulting acute haemolysis triggered oxidants. Previous work shown increased formation altered aspartate residues membrane proteins cell ageing response oxidative stress normal erythrocytes. abnormal residues specifically recognized repair enzyme L-isoaspartate (d-aspartate) protein O-methyltransferase (PCMT; EC 2.1.1.77). aim work study possible involvement protein aspartate damage mechanism linking G6PD defect erythrocyte injury, oxidative stress. Patients affected G6PD deficiency (Mediterranean variant) selected. situ methylation assays performed incubating intact erythrocytes presence methyl-labelled methionine. Altered aspartate residues detected membrane proteins methyl ester quantification. present evidence that, G6PD-deficient erythrocytes, damaged residues significantly increased membrane proteins, parallel decay pyruvate kinase activity, used cell age marker. Erythrocytes patients subjected oxidative stress vitro, treatment t-butylhydroperoxide, monitored rise concentration methaemoglobin thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. L-Isoaspartate residues increased dramatically G6PD-deficient erythrocytes response treatment, compared baseline conditions. increased susceptibility G6PD-deficient erythrocytes membrane protein aspartate damage response oxidative stress suggests involvement protein deamidation/isomerization mechanisms cell injury haemolysis.
