 Pheochromocytomas tumors originating chromaffin cells adrenal medulla, observed numerous carcinogenicity studies. authors evaluated pheochromocytoma concurrence effects possible mechanisms, order assess relevance data classification carcinogenic effects relevance humans. evaluation revealed pheochromocytomas occur relatively higher frequency male rats, especially following conditions involved: hypoxia, uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, disturbance calcium homeostasis, disturbance hypothalamic endocrine axis. underlying biochemical mechanisms suggest substances interfere biochemical endpoints also produce pheochromocytomas. endpoints include enzymes involved catecholamine synthesis, receptor tyrosine kinase (RET), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, pyruvate dehydrogenase. date, indication substances inducing pheochromocytomas animal experiments also induce corresponding tumors humans. mechanisms action identified rats expected humans, pheochromocytomas may induced exposure conditions similar used animal studies. Whether hereditary mutations represent risk factor humans clear. Pheochromocytomas occur animal experiments currently appear little relevance conditions work place. sufficiently documented evaluated, secondary pheochromocytomas relevant classification human risk assessment.
