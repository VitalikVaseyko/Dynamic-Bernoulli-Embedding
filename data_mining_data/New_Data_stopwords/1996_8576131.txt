 ubiquitous upstream stimulatory factor (USF) transcription factors encoded two distinct genes (USF1 USF2) exist form various dimers able bind E-boxes. report molecular cloning functional characterization USF2 isoforms, corresponding 44-kDa subunit, USF2a, new 38-kDa subunit, USF2b, generated differential splicing. Using specific anti-USF antibodies, define different binding complexes various nuclear extracts. vivo, USF1/USF2a heterodimer represents 66% USF binding activity whereas USF1 USF2a homodimers represent less 10%, strongly suggests vivo preferential association heterodimers. particular, USF1/USF2b heterodimer accounted almost 15% USF species cells. preferential heterodimerization USF subunits reproduced ex vivo, vitro association cotranslated subunits, recombinant USF proteins, appeared random. transiently transfected HeLa hepatoma cells, USF2a USF1 homodimers transactivated minimal promoter similar efficiency, whereas USF2b, lacks internal 67-amino acid domain, poor transactivator. Additionally, USF2b efficient USF1 USF2a homodimers transactivating liver-specific pyruvate kinase gene promoter.
