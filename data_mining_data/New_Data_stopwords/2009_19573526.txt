 Leptin previously shown stimulate fatty acid oxidation independent AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Nitric oxide p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) known effectors leptin signaling. aim present study determine whether nitric oxide p38 MAPK mediate stimulation leptin MAPK. Hearts male Sprague-Dawley rats mounted isolated perfused working heart presence absence leptin (1.9 nM), N-Nitro-L-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) (3 microM), specific p38 MAPK inhibitor 4-[4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl] phenol (SB202190, 2 microM) specific STAT-3 inhibitor (E)-2-Cyano-3-(3,4-dihydrophenyl)-N-(phenylmethyl)-2-propenamide (AG490, 5 microM) measurement substrate metabolism function. AMPK carnitine palimitoyltransferase-1 activity, nitrate/nitrite levels, STAT-3 phosphorylation p38 MAPK phosphorylation measured. assess mitochondrial function, hearts perfused without leptin prior isolation mitochondria. Leptin stimulated fatty acid oxidation decreased cardiac function, associated activation STAT-3 p38 MAPK increase tissue nitrate/nitrite levels; effect function ameliorated effect fatty acid oxidation prevented L-NAME, B202190 AG490. L-NAME lowered tissue nitrate/nitrite levels, prevented phosphorylation p38, whereas SB202190 effect tissue nitrate/nitrite levels. AG490 also lowered tissue nitrate/nitrite levels. Leptin effect fatty acid-dependent mitochondrial respiration uncoupling activity, but, surprisingly, stimulated pyruvate-dependent mitochondrial respiration. data indicate leptin stimulates fatty acid oxidation STAT-3-nitric oxide-p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism. target pathway upstream mitochondria.
