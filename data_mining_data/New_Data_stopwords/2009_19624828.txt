 BACKGROUND: vitro data suggest changes myocardial substrate metabolism may contribute impaired myocardial function diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). purpose present study study rat model early DCM, vivo changes myocardial substrate metabolism association myocardial function. METHODS: Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) Zucker lean (ZL) rats underwent echocardiography followed [11C]palmitate positron emission tomography (PET) fasting, [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp conditions. Isolated cardiomyocytes used determine isometric force development. RESULTS: PET data showed 66% decrease insulin-mediated myocardial glucose utilisation 41% increase fatty acid (FA) oxidation ZDF vs. ZL rats (both p < 0.05). Echocardiography showed diastolic systolic dysfunction ZDF vs. ZL rats, paralleled significantly decreased maximal force (68%) maximal rate force redevelopment (69%) single cardiomyocytes. Myocardial functional changes significantly associated whole-body insulin sensitivity decreased myocardial glucose utilisation. ZDF hearts showed 68% decrease glucose transporter-4 mRNA expression (p < 0.05), 22% decrease glucose transporter-4 protein expression (p = 0.10), unchanged levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 protein expression, 57% decreased phosphorylation AMP activated protein kinase alpha1/2 (p < 0.05) 2.4-fold increased abundance FA transporter CD36 sarcolemma (p < 0.01) vs. ZL hearts, compatible changes substrate metabolism. ZDF vs. ZL hearts 2.4-fold reduced insulin-mediated phosphorylation Akt found (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Using PET echocardiography, found increases myocardial FA oxidation concomitant decrease insulin-mediated myocardial glucose utilisation early DCM. addition, latter associated impaired myocardial function. vivo data expand previous vitro findings showing early alterations myocardial substrate metabolism contribute myocardial dysfunction.
