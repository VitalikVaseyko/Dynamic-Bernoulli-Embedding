 Long-term dietary administration adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) male Sprague-Dawley rats induced significant alterations activities enzymes involved liver carbohydrate metabolism. Although glycogen synthase activity increased phosphorylase decreased, glycogen stores reduced. presumably related lysosomal glycogen degradation, since alpha-glucosidase increased. rate-limiting enzymes glucose metabolism studied (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, total hexokinases, pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) revealed markedly reduced activity, glucose-6-phosphatase activity increased. enzymatic changes point far-reaching metabolic shift towards energy loss via decreased glucose consumption increased glucose output. enzyme pattern induced DHEA many respects opposite induced preneoplastic neoplastic liver lesions chemical hepatocarcinogens.
