 M2 splice isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), enzyme catalyzes later step glycolysis, key regulator aerobic glycolysis (known Warburg effect) cancer cells. Expression low enzymatic activity PKM2 confer cancer cells glycolytic phenotype, promotes rapid energy production flow glycolytic intermediates collateral pathways synthesize nucleic acids, amino acids, lipids without accumulation reactive oxygen species. PKM2 enzymatic activity also shown negatively regulated interaction CD44 adhesion molecule, cell surface marker cancer stem cells. addition glycolytic functions, nonglycolytic functions PKM2 cancer cells particular interest. PKM2 induced translocation nucleus, activates transcription various genes interacting phosphorylating specific nuclear proteins, endowing cancer cells survival growth advantage. Therefore, inhibitors activators PKM2 well underway evaluate anticancer effects suitability use novel therapeutic strategies.
