 present study oxidative stress induced Benzo-alpha-pyrene (BaP) exposure potential involvements microRNA investigated. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) applied model organism. C. elegans L1-stage randomly divided 4 groups exposed 0, 0.2, 2.0, 20muM BaP 30h. Expressions SKiNhead-1 (SKN-1), gamma-glutamine cysteine synthase heavy chain (GCS-1), potential regulatory factors insulin/IGF-1/FOXO signaling pathway p38 MAPK pathway analyzed. expressions potentially involved microRNAs investigated well. Results demonstrated expressions SKN-1 GCS-1 altered significantly following BaP exposure (P<0.05). Meanwhile, expressions multiple related factors changed BaP treatments. altered factors include AKT-1, DAF-16, glutathione synthetase (GSS-1), glutathione S-transferase-24 (GST-24), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4 (MKK-4), multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP-1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 (PDHK-2) (P<0.05). addition, results showed exposure BaP led altered expressions microRNA. 28 tested microRNAs, expressions miR-1, miR-355, miR-50, miR-51, miR-58, miR-796, miR-797, miR-84 modified. Findings present study include BaP exposure caused oxidative stress C. elegans. expressional response GCS-1 BaP exposure might independent regulation SKN-1 C. elegans. microRNAs might involved regulations SKN-1 GCS-1 expression following BaP exposure C. elegans.
