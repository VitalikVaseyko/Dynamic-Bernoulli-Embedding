 Hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. Bugang) plants exhibit hypersensitive response (HR) upon infection Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) pathotype P(0). Previously, elucidate molecular mechanism underlies resistance, hot pepper cv. Bugang leaves inoculated TMV-P(0) genes specifically up-regulated HR isolated microarray analysis. One clones, Capsicum annuum cytosolic pyruvate kinase 1 (CaPK(c)1) gene increased specifically incompatible interaction TMV-P(0). expression CaPK(c)1 gene also triggered various hormones salicylic acid (SA), ethylene, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), also NaCl wounding. results suggest CaPK(c)1 responds several defense-related abiotic stresses addition TMV infection.
