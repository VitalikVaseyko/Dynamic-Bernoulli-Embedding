 Aerobic glycolysis Warburg Effect (WE) characterized increased metabolism glucose lactate. remains unknown quantitative changes activity metabolism necessary sufficient phenotype. developed computational model glycolysis integrated analysis using metabolic control analysis (MCA), metabolomics data, statistical simulations. identified confirmed novel mode regulation specific aerobic glycolysis flux GAPDH, enzyme separating lower upper glycolysis, rate-limiting step pathway levels fructose (1,6) bisphosphate (FBP), predictive rate control points glycolysis. Strikingly, negative flux control found confirmed several steps thought rate-limiting glycolysis. Together, findings enumerate biochemical determinants suggest strategies identifying contexts agents target glycolysis might effective.
