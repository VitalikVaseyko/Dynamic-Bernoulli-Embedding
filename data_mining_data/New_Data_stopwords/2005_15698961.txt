 Mutants L-type pyruvate kinase modified peptide sequence around Ser-12 phosphorylation site prepared kinetics phosphorylation protein kinase studied. profile substrate specificity obtained proteins compared kinetic data phosphorylation short peptide substrates. Alterations made protein structure caused weaker effects corresponding alterations made peptides, amino acid preferences overall specificity pattern remained similar cases. Thus, similar consensus motif holds protein peptide substrates, less critical recognition proteins compared short peptides.
