 objective study determine whether dietary energy restriction (DER) affects pattern gene expression three interrelated energy metabolism pathways: glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle. Mammary carcinogenesis initiated i.p. injection female Sprague-Dawley rats 50 mg 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea per kilogram body weight. Five days following 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea administration, animals fed ad libitum 80% 60% ad libitum intake. Epithelial cells harvested histologically confirmed adenocarcinomas (adenocarcinoma epithelial cell; ACEC) uninvolved mammary gland (mammary gland epithelial cells; MGEC) via laser capture microdissection, whereas isolated RNA arrayed Affymetrix R230 2.0 genome chips. Principal components analysis revealed complete separation patterns gene expression ACEC versus MGEC. examination data set revealed up-regulated pattern expression ACEC genes involved glycolysis, whereas gluconeogenesis suppressed. general, genes involved citric acid cycle differentially expressed; however, pyruvate dehydrogenase expression down-regulated lactate dehydrogenase expression increased ACEC versus MGEC. Collectively, observed patterns expression consistent Warburg effect. DER exerted effect Warburg pattern gene expression aspects energy metabolism pathways. findings imply efforts target Warburg effect cancer prevention mechanistically distinct modulated DER provide rationale combination approaches target basic defects energy metabolism energy-sensing pathways prevention breast cancer.
