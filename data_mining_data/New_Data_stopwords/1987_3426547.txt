 1. Increasing concentrations 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), mild respiratory-chain inhibitor [Halestrap (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 927, 280-290], caused progressive inhibition glucose production lactate + pyruvate hepatocytes starved rats incubated presence absence oleate gluconeogenic hormones. 2. significant changes tissue ATP content observed, concomitant decreases ketone-body output cytochrome c reduction increases NADH fluorescence ratios [lactate]/[pyruvate] [beta-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate]. 3. inhibition DCMU palmitoylcarnitine oxidation isolated liver mitochondria used calculate flux control coefficient respiratory chain towards gluconeogenesis. presence 1 mM-oleate, calculated values 0.61, 0.39 0.25 absence hormone presence glucagon phenylephrine respectively, consistent activation respiratory chain situ previously suggested [Quinlan & Halestrap (1986) Biochem. J. 236, 789-800]. 4. Cytoplasmic oxaloacetate concentrations shown decrease conditions, implying inhibition pyruvate carboxylase. 5. Inhibition gluconeogenesis fructose dihydroxyacetone also observed DCMU accompanied increased output lactate + pyruvate, suggesting activation pyruvate kinase occurring. latter substrate, measurements tissue ADP ATP contents showed DCMU caused small fall [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. 6. Two inhibitors fatty acid oxidation, pent-4-enoate 2-tetradecylglycidate, shown abolish decrease respectively effects hormones, valinomycin, gluconeogenesis lactate + pyruvate, without changing tissue ATP content. 7. concluded hormonal increase mitochondrial matrix volume stimulates fatty acid oxidation respiratory-chain activity, allowing stimulation pyruvate carboxylation thus gluconeogenesis occur without major changes [ATP]/[ADP] [NADH]/[NAD+] ratios. 8. high flux control coefficient respiratory chain towards gluconeogenesis may account hypoglycaemic effect mild respiratory-chain inhibitors.
