 Erythrocytes fractionated, centrifugation, basis cell density, proportional cell age. Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) fractionated cells measured compared Hb A1c whole blood fructosamine concentrations plasma normal diabetic subjects. normal subjects, Hb A1c increased according age erythrocytes, hyperbolically rather linearly, indicating slow conversion Hb Hb A1c saturability. greatest correlation Hb A1c plasma fructosamine younger middle-aged cells. subgroup subjects impaired glucose tolerance high Hb A1c older cells. Hb A1c young cells reflects recent glycemic status, monitoring initial stage treatment diabetics, whereas Hb A1c older middle-aged cells specifically reflects longer term glycemic status, screening long-term monitoring index treatment diabetes.
