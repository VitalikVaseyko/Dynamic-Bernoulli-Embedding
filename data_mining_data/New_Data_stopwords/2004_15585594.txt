 livers humans many mammalian species, beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs) play important role modulation glucose production glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis. male mice rats, however, expression physiological role hepatic beta2-ARs rapidly lost development normal physiological conditions. previously described line transgenic mice, F28 (Andre C, Erraji L, Gaston J, Grimber G, Briand P, Guillet JG. Eur J Biochem 241: 417-424, 1996), carry human beta2-AR gene control promoter. mice, hepatic beta2-AR levels shown increase rapidly birth and, humans, maintained elevated level adulthood. F28 mice display strongly enhanced adenylyl cyclase responses beta-AR agonists livers and, compared normal mice, increased basal hepatic adenylyl cyclase activity. report demonstrate that, normal physiological conditions, increased beta2-AR activity affects expression gluconeogenic glycolytic key enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, l-pyruvate kinase considerably decreases hepatic glycogen levels. Furthermore, show effects beta-adrenergic ligands liver glycogen observed humans reproduced mice: liver glycogen levels strongly decreased beta2-AR agonist clenbuterol increased beta-AR antagonist propranolol. transgenic mice open new perspectives studying vivo hepatic beta2-AR system physiopathology testing effects beta-AR ligands liver metabolism.
