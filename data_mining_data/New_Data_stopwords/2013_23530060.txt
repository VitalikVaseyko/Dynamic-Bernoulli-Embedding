 glucose-activated transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) induces expression hepatic glycolytic lipogenic genes. farnesoid X receptor (FXR) nuclear bile acid receptor controlling bile acid, lipid, glucose homeostasis. FXR negatively regulates hepatic glycolysis lipogenesis mouse liver. aim study determine whether FXR regulates transcriptional activity ChREBP human hepatocytes unravel underlying molecular mechanisms. Agonist-activated FXR inhibits glucose-induced transcription several glycolytic genes, including liver-type pyruvate kinase gene (L-PK), immortalized human hepatocyte (IHH) HepaRG cell lines. inhibition requires L4L3 region L-PK promoter, known bind transcription factors ChREBP hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha). FXR interacts directly ChREBP HNF4alpha proteins. Analysis protein complex bound L4L3 region reveals presence ChREBP, HNF4alpha, FXR, transcriptional coactivators p300 CBP high glucose concentrations. FXR activation affect either FXR HNF4alpha binding L4L3 region result concomitant release ChREBP, p300, CBP recruitment transcriptional corepressor SMRT. Thus, FXR transrepresses expression genes involved glycolysis human hepatocytes.
