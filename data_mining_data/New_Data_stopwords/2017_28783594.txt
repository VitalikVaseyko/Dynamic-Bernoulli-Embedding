 Trypanosoma evansi haemo-protozoan parasite responsible disease surra, economically important disease wide range domestic wild animals. present diagnostic methods using soluble antigens inherent problems like lack standardized reproducible antigens, well ethical issues. entails efforts search defined antigenic molecules satisfying sensitivity specificity sero-epidemiology trypanosomosis. present investigation, identified purified 52-55kDa immuno-dominant protein cluster molecular mass ranges preparatory SDS-PAGE methods T. evansi proteome. purified protein characterized hyper immune serum raised rabbits also evaluated immunodiagnostic potential using experimentally infected horse serum samples different immunological tests. immunoblot, ELISA dot blot assay using purified cluster infected pooled serum samples showed detection infection early 10th days post infection till termination experiment. observations revealed purified cluster expressed early stage also persisted detected throughout course infection. Further, whole cell lysate antigen separated detected 141 spots 2-D gel electrophoresis. isoelectric focussing (PI) 52-55kDa determined pH range 6.9 7.5 along two cluster proteins recognised immune sera ponies infected T. evansi. MS/MS analysis purified protein cluster identified five proteins i.e. pyruvate kinase 1, beta tubulin, paraflagellar rod protein, alanine aminotransferase variable surface glycoprotein showing homology protein present Trypanosome database. identified proteins may useful development vaccines diagnostic targets animal trypanosomosis.
