 Blood samples 722 unrelated patients anemia and/or reticulocytosis submitted laboratory red cell enzyme assay past 7 years. Among 722 cases, found 82 cases 7 different red cell enzyme deficiencies 2 unstable hemoglobin. Abnormalities pyruvate kinase (PK) found cause hemolysis 55 patients. Although average PK activity 35% normal level, 5 showed normal 2 demonstrated high PK activity. Among 17 patients pyruvate kinase assays screening tests carried routine laboratories, correct diagnoses made 4. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency found 15 patients, pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency 5, glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency 3, adenylate kinase deficiency 2, phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency 1, glutathione synthetase deficiency 1 patient. Even performed panel 20 different red cell enzyme assays, 519 patients still remained undiagnosed.
