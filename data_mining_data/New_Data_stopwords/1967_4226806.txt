 Whole cells cell-free extracts Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum 3814 grown media containing 0.5% glucose 0.6% pyruvate evaluated metabolic activities toward compounds. Glucose-grown cells rapidly fermented glucose production gases (CO(2) H(2)), acids, alcohol, ferment pyruvate well. Pyruvate-grown cells, hand, readily fermented pyruvate, fermenting glucose rate one-half pyruvate. analysis enzyme levels two cell culture conditions revealed pyruvate-grown cells lower levels glycolytic enzymes increased levels hexose monophosphate pathway enzymes. Incorporation studies use labeled glucose demonstrated cells control mechanism(s) whereby discriminate carbon (glucose) energy (pyruvate) source, selectively utilizing glucose synthetic pathway obtaining energy phosphoroclastic degradation pyruvate.
