 Mitochondria known play key role various cellular processes essential life death cells, including calcium homeostasis, programmed cell death, energy metabolism. 80 years ago, Otto Warburg discovered contrast normal cells produce ATP via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis production ATP, phenomenon known today "Warburg effect", one great importance emergence novel drugs chemotherapeutic agents specifically targeting cancer cells. Several groups reported recent years members plant stress hormones family jasmonates, synthetic derivatives, exhibit anti-cancer activity vitro vivo. Jasmonates shown act directly mitochondria cancer cells, leading mitochondrial swelling, membrane depolarization cytochrome c release. Throughout last years, different groups demonstrated combination jasmonates various cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents yielded synergistic cytotoxic effect. results demonstrated variety different cancer cell lines may provide strong basis future clinical treatments involve combination MJ different anti-cancerous agents. potential synergistic effect may allow reduction administered dose, decrease unwanted side effects, reduction likelihood tumor display resistance combined therapy.
