 OBJECTIVE: purpose study investigate expression metabolism-related proteins Glut-1 carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) according breast cancer molecular subtype. METHODS: generated tissue microarray 276 breast cancer patients performed immunohistochemical staining known metabolism-related proteins, evaluated according molecular subtype. RESULTS: expression IGF-1, MIF, HIF-1alpha correlated HER-2 type (p < 0.05). Glut-1 overexpression CAIX expression associated TNBC type, especially basal-like type, high histologic grade, estrogen receptor negativity, progesterone receptor negativity (p < 0.05). expression Glut-1 CAIX correlated statistical significance (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: identified different patterns expression metabolism-related proteins according molecular subtypes breast cancer defined surrogate immunohistochemistry. Increased expression HIF-1alpha, IGF-1, MIF noted HER-2 type breast cancer increased expression Glut-1 CAIX noted TNBC type breast cancer, especially basal-like subtype, exhibited glycolytic acid-resistant tumor phenotype.
