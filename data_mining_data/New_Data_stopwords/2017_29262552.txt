 Abnormalities cancer metabolism represent potential targets cancer therapy. recently identified natural compound Quambalarine B (QB), inhibits proliferation several leukemic cell lines followed cell death. predicted ubiquinone binding sites mitochondrial respiratory complexes potential molecular targets QB leukemia cells. Hence, tracked effect QB leukemia metabolism applying several omics biochemical techniques. confirmed inhibition respiratory complexes QB found increase intracellular AMP levels together respiratory substrates. Inhibition mitochondrial respiration QB triggered reprogramming leukemic cell metabolism involving disproportions glycolytic flux, inhibition proteins O-glycosylation, stimulation glycine synthesis pathway, pyruvate kinase activity, followed increase pyruvate decrease lactate levels. Inhibition mitochondrial complex QB suppressed folate metabolism determined decrease formate production. also observed increase cellular levels several amino acids except aspartate, indicating dependence Jurkat (T-ALL) cells aspartate synthesis. results indicate blockade mitochondrial complex II activity QB reduction aspartate folate metabolism therapeutic targets T-ALL cells. Anti-cancer activity QB also confirmed vivo studies, suggesting therapeutic potential natural compound.
