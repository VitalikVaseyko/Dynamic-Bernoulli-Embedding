 BACKGROUND: Warburg effect describes increased reliance tumor cells glycolysis ATP generation. Mitochondrial respiratory defect thought important factor leading Warburg effect types tumor cells. Consequently, growing interest developing anti-cancer drugs target mitochondria. One example dichloroacetate (DCA) stimulates mitochondria inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. METHODS: investigated anti-cancer activity DCA using biochemical isotopic tracing methods. RESULTS: observed paclitaxel-resistant cells contained decreased levels citric acid sustained mitochondrial respiratory defect. DCA specifically acted cells mitochondrial respiratory defect reverse paclitaxel resistance. DCA could effectively activate oxidative respiration drug-resistant cells, induced higher levels citrate accumulation, led inhibition glycolysis inactivation P-glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: abilityof DCA target cells mitochondrial respiratory defect restore paclitaxel sensitivity inducing citrate accumulation supports preclinical development.
