 Dexamethasone medium perfusing isolated rabbit livers caused fast-acting reversible effect liver pyruvate kinase. effect lower assayable V activity (units/g tissue) without changing concentration (nmol/g enzyme protein). effect, glucocorticoid lowered specific activity (units/nmol enzyme) direct action liver. effect liver pyruvate kinase mediated relatively stable alteration; 30 min perfusate (with steroid) replaced perfusate (without steroid), effect remained strongly evident.
