 Isolation separation rat liver cells endothelial, Kupffer, parenchymal cell fractions performed different times injection human 125I-acetyl low density lipoproteins (LDL). order minimize degradation redistribution injected lipoprotein cell isolation, low temperature (8 degrees C) procedure applied. Ten min injection, isolated endothelial cells contained 5 times acetyl-LDL apoprotein per mg cell protein Kupffer cells 31 times hepatocytes. similar relative importance different cell types uptake acetyl-LDL observed 30 min injection. studies vitro interaction endothelial Kupffer cells acetyl-LDL, cells isolated collagenase perfusion 37 degrees C. Pure endothelial (greater 95%) purified Kupffer cells (greater 70%) obtained two-step elutriation method. demonstrated rat liver endothelial cell possesses high affinity receptor specific acetyl-LDL 35-fold excess unlabeled acetyl-LDL inhibits association labeled compound 70%, whereas unlabeled native human LDL ineffective. Binding acetyl-LDL receptor coupled rapid uptake degradation apolipoprotein. Addition lysosomotropic agents chloroquine (50 microM) NH4Cl (10 mM) resulted 90% inhibition high affinity degradation, indicating occurs lysosomes. purified Kupffer cell fraction, cell association degradation acetyl-LDL least 4 times less per mg cell protein pure endothelial cells. Although cells isolated cold pronase technique also still able bind degrade acetyl-LDL, appeared 40-60% receptors destroyed inactivated isolation procedure. concluded rat liver endothelial cell main cell type responsible acetyl-LDL uptake.
