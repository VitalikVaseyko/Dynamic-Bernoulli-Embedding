 Pyruvate kinase (PYK) essential glycolytic enzyme controls glycolytic flux critical ATP production organisms, tight regulation multiple metabolites. Yet allosteric mechanisms governing PYK activity bacterial pathogens poorly understood. report biochemical, structural metabolomic evidence Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) PYK uses AMP glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) synergistic allosteric activators function molecular "OR logic gate" tightly regulate energy glucose metabolism. G6P found bind previously unknown site adjacent canonical site AMP. Kinetic data structural network analysis show AMP G6P work synergistically allosteric activators. Importantly, metabolome profiling Mtb surrogate, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, reveals significant changes AMP G6P levels nutrient deprivation, provides insights PYK gate would function stress Mtb infection.
