 synthesis 8-thiocyano-ATP (CNS8-ATP) described. 37 degrees C ATP analogue inactivates Na,K-ATPase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase. three cases, inactivation prevented addition ATP, thus indicating CNS8-ATP recognized within ATP binding site enzymes. Incubation inactivated enzymes dithiothreitol restores catalytic activities. Therefore, likely enzymes mixed disulfide (E-S-S8-ATP) formed sulfhydryl ATP binding site (E-SH) ATP analogue: [formula: see text] pseudo-first-order inactivation kinetics, KD = 2.7 microM k2 = 0.142 min-1 calculated hexokinase KD = 40 microM k2 = 0.347 min-1 calculated pyruvate kinase interactions ATP analogue. 4 degrees C, Na,K-ATPase recognizes CNS8-ATP KD = 8.3 microM. 37 degrees C, enzyme becomes inactivated ATP analogue biphasic manner. Inactivation results incorporation [alpha-32P]8-CNS8-ATP catalytic alpha-subunit enzyme. Limited tryptic digestion presence 150 mM KCl results formation radioactive peptide Mr = 56,000, known bear purine binding domain Na,K-ATPase. results described article verify CNS8-ATP sulfhydryl-reactive ATP analogue characterize new ATP analogue useful tool structure/function studies ATP-recognizing enzymes.
