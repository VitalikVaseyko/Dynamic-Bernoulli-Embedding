 M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PK) upregulated cancers including glioblastoma. Although PKM2 reported use dual kinase activities regulate cell growth, also interacts phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptides independently kinase activity. potential PKM2 use binding pY-containing proteins control tumor growth fully examined. describe novel mechanism PKM2 interacts nucleus RNA binding protein HuR regulate HuR sub-cellular localization, p27 levels, cell cycle progression glioma cell growth. Suppression PKM2 U87, T98G LN319 glioma cells resulted increased p27 levels, defects entry mitosis, increased centrosome number, decreased cell growth. effects could reversed shRNA targeting p27. increased levels p27 PKM2 knock-down cells caused loss nuclear interaction PKM2 HuR, subsequent cytoplasmic re-distribution HuR, turn led increased cap-independent p27 mRNA translation. Consistent results, alterations p27 mRNA translation, cell cycle progression cell growth caused PKM2 suppression could reversed vitro vivo suppression HuR p27 levels, introduction forms PKM2 could bind pY, regardless kinase activity. results define novel mechanism PKM2 regulates glioma cell growth, also define novel set potential therapeutic targets along PKM2-HuR-p27 pathway.
