 TT-232 structural analogue somatostatin exhibiting strong selective growth-inhibitory effects, inhibition neurogenic inflammation, well general anti-inflammatory analgesic potential without wide-ranging endocrine side effects parent hormone "traditional" analogues. anti-inflammatory action TT-232 mediated SSTR4 receptor, antitumor activity mediated SSTR1 receptor tumor-specific isoform pyruvate kinase. mechanism action line new era molecular medicine called signal transduction therapy, "false" intracellular intercellular communication inhibited corrected without interfering basic cell functions machinery. TT232 passed phase clinical trials without toxicity significant side effects, phase II studies running oncological anti-inflammatory indications, respectively. compound perspective become first drug molecularly targeted therapy inflammation combined effect anti-inflammatory, analgesic, neurogenic inflammation-inhibiting activity achieved.
