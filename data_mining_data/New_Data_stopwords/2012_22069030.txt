 Structural-functional divergence responsible preservation highly homologous genes. Protein functions affected mutagenesis divergent sequences require investigation individual basis. present study, comparative homology modeling predictive bioinformatics analysis used reveal first time subfunctionalization two pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isozymes western clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis. Three-dimensional structures two proteins built homology modeling based crystal structures mammalian PDKs. detailed comparison revealed important structural differences modify accessibility nucleotide binding site two isozymes. Based generated models bioinformatics data analysis, differences two proteins terms kinetic parameters, metabolic regulation, tissue distribution predicted. results obtained consistent idea one xtPDKs major isozyme responsible metabolic control PDC activity X. tropicalis, whereas one specialized functions. Hence, study provides rationale existence two closely related PDK isozymes X. tropicalis, thereby enhancing understanding functional evolution PDK family genes.
