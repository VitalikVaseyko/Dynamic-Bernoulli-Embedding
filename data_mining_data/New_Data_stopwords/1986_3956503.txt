 characterize pyruvate kinase isoenzymes cells capability proliferate, enzyme purified yolk vitelline membrane unfertilized hen's egg. Pyruvate kinase type M2 vitelline membrane obtained homogeneous form 1150-fold purification specific enzymatic activity 450 mumol X min-1 X mg-1. saturated half-maximally phosphoenolpyruvate KPPrv0.5 = 0.36 mM phosphoenolpyruvate activity fructose 1,6-bisphosphate L-serine suboptimal substrate concentrations. 11 000-fold purification specific enzymatic activity 60 mumol X min-1 X mg-1, pyruvate kinase isoenzymes type M2 (KPPrv0.5 = 0.32 mM) M1 (KPPrv0.5 = 0.04 mM) obtained yolk substance. Kinetic differences noted pyruvate kinase type-M2 isoenzymes vitelline membrane yolk. comparison amino acid composition purified pyruvate kinase isoenzymes hen's egg revealed isoenzymes related pyruvate kinase type M1 chicken breast muscle. M2-type isoenzyme vitelline membrane related M2-type isoenzyme chicken tumors, related M2-type pyruvate kinase chicken lung liver. Protein kinase C chicken oviduct phosphorylated vitro pyruvate kinase M2 isoenzymes unfertilized hen's egg preferably serine less threonine residues. Pyruvate kinase type M1 egg yolk weak substrate protein kinase C. activation pyruvate kinase type M2 vitelline membrane observed suboptimal concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate conditions phosphorylation, presence phosphatidylserine.
