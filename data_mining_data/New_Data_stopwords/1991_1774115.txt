 Several key enzymes related carbohydrate metabolism assayed Setaria digitata. cytosolic fraction pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, aspartate transaminase alanine transaminase found. Among TCA cycle enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, fumarase (malate dehydration), malate dehydrogenase (malate oxidation oxaloacetate reduction) malic enzyme (malate decarboxylation) detected mitochondrial fraction. reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase, NADH oxidase NADH-cytochrome c reductase found mitochondrial fraction. significance results respect metabolic capabilities worm discussed.
