 detailed model intermediary metabolism constructed consistent known information compartmental structure metabolism Tetrahymena, enzyme complement cell, localization enzymes. model allows computation specific activity every carbon atom metabolites thus flux carbon along major pathways metabolism steady state conditions. test model, data required cells grown standard conditions suspended dilute salt solution incubated 1 hour mixture acetate, pyruvate, hexanoate, bicarbonate, glutamate labeled total 10 positions, one substrate labeled given flask. Twenty-seven measurements label incorporation CO2, lipids, glycogen, glutamate, alanine made, plus measurements label distribution fatty acid glycerol moieties 4 substrates oxygen consumption glycogenolysis, yielding 33 independent measurements. These, plus 18 "limit" measurements also constrain possible solutions, sufficient excess 23 independent parameters permit stringent assessment model. Equations derived directly structure model known stereochemistry reactions programmed PDP-15 computer values Qo2 label expected incorporated various products actually measured computed given set flux rates. set flux rates found yielded excellent fit observed data. ability achieve fit data overdetermined system constitutes strong support structural model intermediary metabolism computed flux rates therefore provide quantitative description metabolite flow intact cell. Despite redundancy measurements relative parameters determined, possible define unique set values flux phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, although relationship fluxes specified model. analysis allows estimation recycling phosphoenopyruvate pyruvate kinase conditions net glyconeogenesis apparently futile exchange acetyl-CoA inner outer mitochondrial compartments. Carbon flow glyoxylate bypass conditions one-third Krebs cycle. analysis also shows net transport malate peroxisomes mitochondria, consistent anaplerotic role peroxisomal glyoxylate bypass Tetrahymena.
