 Glioblastomas (GBMs) malignant tumors characterized vascularity invasive capabilities. Antiangiogenic therapy (AAT) treatment option targets GBM-associated vasculature mitigate growth GBMs. However, AAT demonstrates transient effects many patients eventually develop resistance treatment. Several recent studies attempt explain molecular biochemical basis resistance AAT GBM patients. Experimental investigations suggest induction extensive intratumoral hypoxia plays key role GBM escape AAT. review, examine AAT resistance GBMs, emphasis six potential hypoxia-mediated mechanisms: enhanced invasion migration, including increased expression matrix metalloproteinases activation c-MET tyrosine kinase pathway; shifts cellular metabolism, including up-regulation hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha's downstream processes Warburg effect; induction autophagy; augmentation GBM stem cell self-renewal; possible implications GBM-endothelial cell transdifferentiation; vasoformative responses, including vasculogenesis, alternative angiogenic pathways, vascular mimicry. Juxtaposing recent studies well-established resistance pathways emerging mechanisms highlights overall complexity GBM treatment resistance also providing direction investigation.
