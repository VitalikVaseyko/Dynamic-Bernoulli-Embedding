 activities oxidative glycolytic enzymes show body size-dependent relationships across wide variety taxa; however, mechanistic basis remains unknown. sampled white epaxial muscle rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) spanning 100-fold range body mass. measured activities enzymes aerobic anaerobic metabolic pathways, RNA [total RNA mRNA, pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate synthase (CS), MyoD mRNA], total DNA. Total RNA DNA showed biphasic relationship body size, break point occurring fish reached 1 yr age. contrast, total RNA/total DNA constant across entire size range. Neither CS activity CS mRNA levels scaled body mass. PK activity PK mRNA levels increased parallel yearling fish (r(2) = 0.91, P < 0.01). suggests although PK expression transcriptionally regulated yearlings, molecular mechanisms regulating expression change growth age. supported positive correlation MyoD PK mRNA levels (r(2) = 0.17, P < 0.05).
