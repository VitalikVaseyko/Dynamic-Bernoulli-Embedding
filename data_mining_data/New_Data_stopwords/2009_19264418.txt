 avid consumption glucose concomitant lactate production malignant cells, even aerobic conditions, called Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis. metabolic state final common pathway apparently serves various invasive purposes. invasive tumours display Warburg effect, proven great clinical importance detecting malignancies 18-fluorine 2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans. However, using Warburg effect target malignancies proven difficult. Since hypoglycaemia shown tumouricidal cancers display Warburg effect, various schemes block glucose utilization investigated. vivo difficult selectively target glucose utilization malignant cells without harming normal cells. Cancer cells produce large amounts lactate Warburg effect, without fully oxidizing CO(2). contrast normal cells completely oxidize lactate aerobic conditions. Recent studies demonstrated vital organs brain, heart, liver, kidneys muscle capable oxidizing lactate fuel alternative glucose. also shown hypoglycaemia intravenous lactate serve salvage fuel man. clinical studies showed patients effectively metabolize large amounts exogenous lactate. appears reflect recently recognized major physiological role lactate glucose alternative. Consequently, lactate logical candidate serve salvage fuel local systemic hypoglycemia induced. Thus, hypothesize combination hypoglycaemia induced insulin concomitant lactate administration selectively suppress cancers manifesting Warburg effect, since cancers great difficulty metabolizing lactate. metabolic therapy could modulated many ways amplitude, duration timing respect therapies. validated isolated limb perfusion (ILP) model sarcoma appears attractive model evaluate local therapy insulin lactate test (adjuvant) tumouricidal effects animals man. effects could evaluated modern metabolic detection techniques FDG-PET magnetic resonance imaging local models animals humans. Subsequently systemic effects hypoglycaemia combined sodium lactate administration could evaluated.
