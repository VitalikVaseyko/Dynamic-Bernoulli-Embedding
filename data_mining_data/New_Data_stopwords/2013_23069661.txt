 LTF (lactotransferrin, also known lactoferrin) key component innate immune defense. recently found anti-tumor anti-metastatic activity different cancers. previously reported LTF significantly downregulated gene nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens relative normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues, also negatively associated progression metastasis NPC. However, mechanism underlying remains unclear. current study, revealed LTF suppress 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 expression via mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-Jun pathway thus repress AKT signaling. also showed LTF interacts keratin 18 (K18) blocks formation K18-14-3-3 complex, leading downregulation K18-mediated AKT activation. Thus, LTF suppresses AKT signaling two separate mechanisms, leading inhibition NPC tumorigenesis. first report tumor suppressive effects LTF repression AKT signaling NPC. suggests LTF AKT signaling merit study field NPC research.
