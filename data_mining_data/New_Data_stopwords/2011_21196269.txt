 Cancer cells different normal cells metabolic properties. Normal cells mostly rely mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation produce energy. contrast, cancer cells depend mostly glycolysis, aerobic breakdown glucose ATP. altered energy dependency known "Warburg effect" hallmark cancer cells. recent years, investigating metabolic changes within cancer cells rapidly growing area. Emerging evidence shows oncogenes drive cancer-promoting signals also drive altered metabolism. Although exact mechanisms underlying Warburg effect unclear, existing evidence suggests increased glycolysis plays important role support malignant behavior cancer cells. thorough understanding unique metabolism cancer cells help design effective drugs targeting metabolic pathways, greatly impact capacity effectively treat cancer patients. provide overview current understanding Warburg effect upon tumor cell growth survival, discussion potential metabolic targets cancer therapy.
