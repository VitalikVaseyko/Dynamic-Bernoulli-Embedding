 interactions isozymes pyruvate kinase cellular structure studied major tissues mouse development. Overall, data provide firm indication interactions enzyme cellular structure appreciable tissues stages development, analysis isozyme status enzyme soluble bound compartments effected. Evidence provided A4 form pyruvate kinase interacts greater extent subcellular structure C4 form, C4 form turn interacts greater extent subcellular structure B4 form.
