 Aberrant miRNA expression well recognized cancer hallmark, nevertheless miRNA function expression always correlate patients tissues cell lines studies. addition issue, miRNA strand usage conduces increased cell signaling pathways modulation diversifying cellular processes regulation. cervical cancer, 20 miRNA families involved carcinogenesis induction development moment. families 5p 3p strands different nucleotide (nt) chain sizes. general, mature 5p strands larger: two miRNAs 24 nt, 24 miRNAs 23 nt, 35 miRNAs 22 nt three miRNAs 21 nt. hand, 3p strands lengths observed are: seven miRNAs 23 nt, 50 miRNAs 22 nt, six miRNAs 21 nt four miRNAs 20 nt. Based analysis 20 miRNA families associated cervical cancer, 67 3p strands 65 5p strands selected suggesting selectivity specificity mechanisms regulating cell processes like proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, metabolism Warburg effect. insight reviewed could used miRNA based therapy, diagnosis prognosis approaches.
