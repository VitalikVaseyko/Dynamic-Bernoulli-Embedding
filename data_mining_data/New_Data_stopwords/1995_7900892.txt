 Limitation myocardial injury infarction demonstrated interventions ischemic preconditioning use pyruvate substrate, reduces glycogen content before, acidosis during, ischemia. isolated perfused rat heart model global ischemia employed test hypothesis glycogen depletion reduces ischemic injury measured creatine kinase release. 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy used measure high-energy phosphates (ATP phosphocreatine), phosphomonoesters (PME), intracellular pH. Compared control glucose-perfused hearts normal glycogen content (1.49 +/- 0.13 mg Glc/g wet wt), glycogen-depleted pyruvate, ischemic preconditioned, glycogen-depleted glucose hearts reduced glycogen content ischemia (0.62 +/- 0.16, 0.81 +/- 0.10, 0.67 +/- 0.12 mg Glc/g wet wt, respectively; P = 0.003) significantly higher pH end ischemia (5.85 +/- 0.02, 6.33 +/- 0.06, 6.24 +/- 0.04, 6.12 +/- 0.02 control, glycogen-depleted pyruvate, preconditioned, glycogen-depleted glucose-perfused hearts, respectively; P < 0.01), although acidification initial phase ischemia differentially affected three interventions. Glycogen-depleted pyruvate preconditioned hearts reduced PME accumulation, greater recovery function phosphocreatine, lower creatine kinase release reperfusion, whereas glycogen-depleted glucose-perfused hearts similar control hearts. summary, glycogen depletion three methods limits fall pH global ischemia, although glycogen depletion absence preconditioning limit ischemic injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
