 Transcription rat fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene rat liver regulated feeding high carbohydrate diet. carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) located rat FAS gene promoter identified. Using multiple copies ChoRE bait yeast one-hybrid system, rat liver cDNA library screened, cDNA ChoRE-binding proteins cloned. positive clone encodes basic helix-loop-helix protein, enhancer split- hairy-related protein-2 (SHARP-2), obtained. Northern blot analysis revealed levels SHARP-2 mRNA increase high carbohydrate diet fed normal rats insulin administered diabetic rats. primary cultured rat hepatocytes, insulin rapidly induced accumulation SHARP-2 mRNA even absence glucose. time course increase SHARP-2 mRNA levels indicated followed FAS L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs initial time course SHARP-2 mRNA similar changes levels glucokinase mRNA phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA. Although wortmannin, LY294002, actinomycin blocked increase SHARP-2 mRNA levels insulin, rapamycin, staurosporine, PD98059, okadaic acid, 8-bromocyclic AMP effect. addition, nuclear run-on assay revealed transcription rat SHARP-2 gene induced insulin. Thus, conclude insulin induces transcription rat SHARP-2 gene via phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway.
