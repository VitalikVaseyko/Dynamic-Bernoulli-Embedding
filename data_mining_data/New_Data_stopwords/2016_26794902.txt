 work aimed characterize uptake folate glucose breast cancer cells study effect lactate upon transport nutrients upon cell viability, proliferation migration capacity. Data obtained showed that: a) MCF7 cells uptake (3)H-folic acid ((3)H-FA) physiological acidic pH; b) T47D cells accumulate (3)H-FA (14)C-5-methyltetrahydrofolate ((14)C-5-MTHF) efficiently acidic physiological pH; c) (3)H-deoxyglucose ((3)H-DG) uptake T47D cells sodium-independent, inhibited cytochalasin B (CYT B) stimulated insulin. Regarding effect lactate, T47D cells, acute (26 min) chronic (24 h) exposure lactic acid (LA) stimulated (3)H-FA uptake. Acute exposure LA also stimulated (3)H-DG uptake chronic exposure LA significantly stimulated T47D cell migratory capacity. conclusion, transport folates strikingly different two phenotypically similar breast cancer cell lines: MCF7 T47D cells. Additionally, lactate seems act signaling molecule increases uptake nutrients promotes migration capacity T47D cells.
