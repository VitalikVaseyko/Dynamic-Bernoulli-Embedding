 BACKGROUND: generally accepted energy resources cancer cells rely anaerobic metabolism glycolytic system, even sufficient oxygen. known Warburg effect. cells skillfully survive hypoglycemic conditions circumstances change, probably least partly involves microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. METHODS: determine cancer cells exploit miRNA-mediated epigenetic mechanisms survive hypoglycemic conditions, used DNA microarray analysis comprehensively simultaneously compare expression miRNAs mRNAs HepG2 human hepatoma cell line cultured normal human hepatocytes. RESULTS: hypoglycemic condition decreased expression miRNA-17-5p -20a-5p hepatoma cells consequently upregulated expression target gene p21. regulations also confirmed using antisense inhibitors miRNAs. addition change, hypoglycemic condition led upregulated expression heat shock proteins increased resistance caspase-3-induced apoptosis. However, could identify miRNA-mediated regulations, despite using comprehensive detection. Several interesting genes also found upregulated hypoglycemic condition microarray analysis, probably responding cellular stress. CONCLUSION: results suggest cancer cells skillfully survive hypoglycemic conditions, frequently occur malignancies, gene regulation process manipulated miRNAs.
