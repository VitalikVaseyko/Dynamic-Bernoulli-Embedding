 PURPOSE: Solid tumors contain microenvironmental regions hypoxia present barrier traditional radiotherapy chemotherapy, work describes novel approach circumvent hypoxia. propose overcome hypoxia augmenting effectiveness drugs designed specifically kill hypoxic tumor cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: constructed RKO colorectal tumor cells express small RNA hairpin specifically knocks hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a) transcription factor. used cells vitro determine effect HIF1 cellular sensitivity hypoxic cytotoxin PR-104, role cellular oxygen consumption response pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA). used cells vivo xenografted tumors determine role HIF1 regulating tumor hypoxia response DCA using (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission tomography, role regulating tumor sensitivity combination DCA PR-104. RESULTS: HIF1 affect cellular sensitivity PR-104 vitro. DCA transiently increases cellular oxygen consumption vitro increases extent tumor hypoxia vivo measured (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission tomography. Furthermore, show DCA-dependent alterations hypoxia increase antitumor activity next-generation hypoxic cytotoxin PR-104. CONCLUSIONS: DCA interferes HIF-dependent "adaptive response," limits mitochondrial oxygen consumption. approach transiently increases tumor hypoxia represents important method improve antitumor efficacy hypoxia-targeted agents, without increasing toxicity oxygenated normal tissue.
