 Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 incretin hormone well-characterized antidiabetic properties, including glucose-dependent stimulation insulin secretion enhancement beta-cell mass. GLP-1 agonists recently developed clinical use treatment type 2 diabetes. Rapid degradation GLP-1 enzymes including dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-IV neutral endopeptidase (NEP) 24.11, along renal clearance, contribute short biological half-life, necessitating frequent injections maintain therapeutic efficacy. Gene therapy may represent promising alternative approach achieving long-term increases endogenous release GLP-1. developed novel strategy glucose-regulated production GLP-1 hepatocytes expressing DPP-IV-resistant GLP-1 peptide hepatocytes control liver-type pyruvate kinase promoter. Adenoviral delivery construct hepatocytes vitro resulted production secretion bioactive GLP-1 measured luciferase-based bioassay developed detect NH2-terminally modified GLP-1 peptide engineered study. Transplantation encapsulated hepatocytes CD-1 mice resulted increase plasma GLP-1 levels accompanied significant reduction fasting plasma glucose levels. results study demonstrate gene therapy approach designed induce GLP-1 production hepatocytes may represent novel strategy long-term secretion bioactive GLP-1 treatment type 2 diabetes.
