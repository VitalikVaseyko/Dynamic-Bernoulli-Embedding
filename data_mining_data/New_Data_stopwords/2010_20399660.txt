 response stress, p53 initiates transcriptional regulation selected target genes various cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis senescence. Recent studies revealed two additional functions p53 regulation IGF-1/AKT/mTOR pathways energy metabolism, contributing p53's role tumor suppressor. Oncogenic processes give rise metabolic pathways focused upon use aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) pentose shunt, providing higher levels reducing activities. p53 shuts pathways refocuses cells utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thereby maximizing efficient ATP production minimizing synthesis substrates cell division. use alternative metabolic pathways integral part normal oncogenic phenotypes.
