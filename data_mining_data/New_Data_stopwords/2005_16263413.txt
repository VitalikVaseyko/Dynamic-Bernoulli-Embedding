 OBJECTIVE: deficiency pyruvate kinase (PK) common cause hereditary nonspherocytic anemia due glycolytic enzyme defects. Red cells poorly deformable due adenosine triphosphate depletion individuals PK deficiency destroyed microcirculation reticuloendothelial system, leading extravascular hemolysis. pathophysiology PK deficiency widely studied PK-deficient mice (PK-1(slc)). examined effects PK deficiency erythroid progenitor maturation using mice. MATERIALS METHODS: appearance apoptotic cells spleen PK-1(slc) mice examined terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. also assayed hematopoietic stem cell colony formation vitro spleen PK-1(slc) mice, investigate erythropoiesis, annexin V binding, measure apoptotic cells constitutive erythroid colonies, evaluate maturation erythroid progenitors. RESULTS: number hematopoietic progenitors including colony-forming unit erythroids, burst-forming unit erythroids (BFU-E), colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophages, multilineage colony-forming units spleens PK-1(slc) remarkably increased indicating hematopoiesis, enhanced erythropoiesis particular. TUNEL assays identified apoptotic cells splenic red pulp PK-1(slc) mice. Two-color flow cytometry detected apoptotic cells among anti-TER119-positive cells, suggesting apoptotic cells erythroid lineage. Cells undergoing apoptosis detected cultures BFU-E generated bone marrow cells PK-1(slc) mice. CONCLUSIONS: results study indicate metabolic disturbance PK deficiency alters survival red cells also maturation erythroid progenitors, resulting ineffective erythropoiesis.
