 influence phosphite (H2PO3-) response Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthophosphate (HPO4(2-); Pi) starvation assessed. Phosphate-repressible acid phosphatase (rAPase) derepression cell development abolished phosphate-sufficient (+Pi) yeast subcultured phosphate-deficient (-Pi) media containing 0.1 mM phosphite. contrast, treatment 0.1 mM phosphite exerted influence rAPase activity growth +Pi cells. 31P NMR spectroscopy revealed phosphite assimilated concentrated yeast cultured 0.1 mM phosphite, levels sugar phosphates, pyrophosphate, particularly polyphosphate significantly reduced phosphite-treated -Pi cells. Examination phosphite's effects two PHO regulon mutants constitutively express rAPase indicated (i) potential target phosphite's action -Pi yeast Pho84 (plasmalemma high-affinity Pi transporter component putative phosphate sensor-complex), (ii) additional mechanism exists control rAPase expression independent Pho85 (cyclin-dependent protein kinase). Marked accumulation polyphosphate delta pho85 mutant suggested Pho85 contributes control polyphosphate metabolism. Results consistent hypothesis phosphite obstructs signaling pathway S. cerevisiae perceives responds phosphate deprivation molecular level.
