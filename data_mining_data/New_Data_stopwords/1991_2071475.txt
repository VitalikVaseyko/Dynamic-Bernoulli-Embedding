 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency first described Basenjis 20 years ago. Although approach diagnosis well established, screening program detect heterozygotes thought eliminated PK deficiency Basenjis United States. Four closely related Basenjis severe chronic hemolytic anemia, various parts United States, studied. PCV ranged 16 25% reticulocyte count always 15%. progressive osteosclerosis seen Basenjis hepatic failure developed 2 them. erythrocyte intermediary metabolite patterns indicated glycolytic defect PK step. Erythrocyte PK activities markedly increased anemic Basenjis, compared control group, enzyme Basenjis abnormal kinetic properties thermolabile. antibody R-type PK, regular erythrocyte PK form, neutralize PK activity affected Basenjis, results electrophoretic studies suggested expression M2-type PK, leukocyte fetal erythroid PK-type. Clinically healthy heterozygous Basenjis half-normal R-type PK activity express M2-type erythrocytes. conclude severe chronic hemolytic anemia, caused erythrocyte PK deficiency, associated osteosclerosis still develop Basenjis. definitive diagnosis cannot reached simply measuring erythrocyte PK activity; rather, diagnosis requires measurement glycolytic substrate accumulation enzyme stability immunologic electrophoretic studies erythrocyte PK.
