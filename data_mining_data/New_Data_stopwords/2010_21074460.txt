 Immune tolerance enteric commensal bacteria important preventing intestinal inflammation. Deletion phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) cells via Cd4-Cre induced chronic inflammation intestine despite importance PDK1 cell activation. Analysis colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes PDK1-deficient mice revealed markedly increased CD8alpha(+) cell receptor (TCR)gammadelta(+) cells, including interleukin-17 (IL-17)-expressing population. TCRgammadelta(+) cells responsible inflammatory colitis shown fact deletion Tcrd abolished spontaneous colitis PDK1-deficient mice. dysregulation intestinal TCRgammadelta(+) cells attributable reduction number functional capacity PDK1-deficient regulatory (Treg) cells. Adoptive transfer wild-type Treg cells abrogated spontaneous activation proliferation intestinal TCRgammadelta(+) cells observed PDK1-deficient mice prevented development colitis. Therefore, suppression intestinal TCRgammadelta(+) cells Treg cells maintains enteric immune tolerance.
