 Cancer cells undergo distinct metabolic changes cope hypoxic environment. changes achieved least partly action transcriptional factors called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). investigated gene expression cultured human colon cancer cells induced hypoxic conditions special reference cell-adhesion molecules carbohydrate determinants cell-adhesive activity using DNA-microarray RT-PCR techniques. Hypoxic culture colon cancer cells induced marked increase expression selectin ligands, sialyl Lewis x sialyl Lewis determinants cell surface, led definite increase cancer cell adhesion endothelial E-selectin. transcription genes fucosyltransferase VII (FUT7), sialyltransferase ST3Gal-I (ST3O), UDP-galactose transporter-1 (UGT1), known involved synthesis carbohydrate ligands E-selectin, significantly induced cancer cells hypoxic culture. addition, remarkable induction detected genes syndecan-4 (SDC4) alpha5-integrin (ITGA5), cell-adhesion molecules involved enhanced adhesion cancer cells fibronectin. transcriptional induction hypoxia reproduced luciferase-reporter assays genes, significantly suppressed co-transfection dominant-negative form HIF. results indicate metabolic shifts cancer cells partly mediated HIFs significantly enhance adhesion vascular endothelial cells, selectin- integrin-mediated pathways, suggest enhancement facilitates hematogenous metastasis cancers tumor angiogenesis.
