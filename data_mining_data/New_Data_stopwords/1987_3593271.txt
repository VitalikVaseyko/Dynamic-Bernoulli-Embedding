 Exposure L929 murine fibroblasts ozone resulted K+ leakage inhibition several enzymes. sensitive ozone exposure glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. activities another cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase activity lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase beta-glucuronidase were, initially, slightly affected. localization lysosomal enzymes change ozone exposure. prolonged exposure complete deterioration cells observed enzyme activities declined. activity enzymes also monitored ozone exposure sonicated cell suspension shown enzymes fact susceptible ozone. observations clearly demonstrate that, besides structure amino acid composition enzyme, localization cell plays important role susceptibility ozone. intracellular levels reduced oxidized glutathione affected well. ATP content, however, proved insensitive ozone exposure.
