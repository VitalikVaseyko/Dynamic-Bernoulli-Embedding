 Cancer cells develop succeed shifting different metabolic programs compared normal cell counterparts. One classical hallmarks cancer cells higher glycolysis rate lactate production even presence abundant O2 (Warburg effect). Another common metabolic feature cancer cells high rate glutamine (Gln) consumption normally exceeding biosynthetic energetic needs. term Gln addiction widely used reflect strong dependence shown cancer cells essential nitrogen substrate metabolic reprogramming. Gln/glutamate (Glu) cycle occurs host tissues tumor order maximize growth proliferation rates. mechanistic basis deregulated tumor metabolism changes connected oncogenic tumor suppressor pathways becoming increasingly understood. Based advances, new avenues research initiated find novel therapeutic targets explore strategies interfere glutamine metabolism anticancer therapies. review, provided updated overview glutamine addiction glioma, prevalent type brain tumor.
