 CdG, carbocyclic analog 2'-deoxyguanosine, active herpes, hepatitis B, human cytomegaloviruses. studied interaction tritiated enantiomers CdG herpes simplex virus type 1-specific thymidine kinase (HSV-1 TK) examined metabolism uninfected HSV-1-infected cells. D- L-CdG equally effective competitive inhibitors phosphorylation thymidine (dThd) partially purified HSV-1 TK (Ki values 2.1 3.4 microM, respectively) also equal substrates (Km values 17 26 microM, respectively, Vmax values enantiomers equal 50% greater Vmax dThd). partially purified enzyme preparation, contained cellular nucleotide kinase activities (pyruvate kinase also present assay medium), converted D-CdG almost exclusively triphosphate L-CdG almost exclusively monophosphate. Similarly, virus-infected cells D-enantiomer converted predominantly triphosphate L-enantiomer predominantly monophosphate. uninfected cells results qualitatively similar. CEM cells deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase (EC 2.7.1.74) seemed enzyme principally responsible phosphorylation enantiomers, shown competition studies. Thus, HSV-1 TK cellular dCyd kinase (of CEM cells) showed selectivity enantiomers CdG. lack enantiomeric specificity obvious implications design inhibitors viral proliferation cellular metabolism.
