 Human erythrocyte R-type pyruvate kinase (RPK) deficiency autosomal recessive disorder produced mutations PKLR gene, causing chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Survival patients severe RPK deficiency associated compensatory expression red blood cells (RBCs) M2PK, isoenzyme showing wide tissue distribution. describe novel homozygous null mutation PKLR gene found girl prenatal diagnosis PK deficiency. mutant PK gene revealed 11-nucleotide (nt) duplication exon 8, causing frameshift PKLR transcript, predicting truncated protein inferred catalytic activity. Western blot analysis quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detected M2PK expression peripheral blood red cell fraction. expression mutant RPK mRNA RBCs almost 6 times higher detected control patient hereditary spherocytosis. molecular phenotypic analysis null mutation PKLR gene provides evidence lack M2PK mature RBCs patient suggests normal red cell functions survival achieved population young erythroid cells released circulation response anemia.
