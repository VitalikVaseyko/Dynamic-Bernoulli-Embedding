 BACKGROUND: Neisseria meningitidis frequent colonizer human nasopharynx, asymptomatic carriage providing reservoir invasive, disease-causing strains. Serogroup (MenY) strains major cause meningococcal disease. High-resolution genetic analyses carriage disease isolates establish epidemiological relationships identify potential virulence factors. METHODS: Whole-genome sequence data obtained 99 MenY carriage isolates recovered United Kingdom 1997-2010. Sequences compared 73 MenY invasive isolates recovered 2010-2011, using gene-by-gene approach. RESULTS: Comparisons across 1605 core genes resolved 91% isolates one 8 clusters containing closely related disease carriage isolates. Six clusters contained carried meningococci isolated 1997-2001, suggesting temporal stability. One cluster isolates, predominately sharing designation Y: P1.5-1,10-1: F4-1: ST-1655 (cc23), resolved one subcluster 86% carriage isolates second 90% invasive isolates. subclusters defined specific allelic differences 5 core genes encoding glycerate kinase (glxK), valine-pyruvate transaminase (avtA), superoxide dismutase (sodB), 2 hypothetical proteins. CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution genetic analyses detected long-term temporal stability temporally overlapping carriage disease populations MenY clones also evidence disease-associated clone.
