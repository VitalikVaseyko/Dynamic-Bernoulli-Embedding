 effect phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) administered ischemia investigated, using paracorporeal rat heart model. 15 min global ischemia hearts perfused twice PEP ATP (supplemented) NaCl (non-supplemented). hearts freeze-clamped ischemic period (group A), myocardial content high-energy phosphates showed minor differences hearts without supplemention. supplemented hearts increased myocardial content pyruvate and, extent, lactate, indicating PEP metabolized pyruvate partly lactate. groups B C hearts reperfused 40 min freeze-clamping. non-supplemented hearts showed higher energy content better left ventricular performance and, concomitantly, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) efflux less supplemented hearts. clear inverse relationship left ventricular performance CK-MB efflux indicated CK-MB served marker cell integrity. results contrasted previus finding unequivocally positive effect PEP ATP administration. Possible explanations discussed.
