 cDNA coding luciferase firefly Photinus pyralis amplified vitro generate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites. DNA transcribed translated generate light-emitting protein. valine position 217 mutated arginine generate site RRFS heptapeptide kemptide, phosphorylation site porcine pyruvate kinase, added N- C-terminus luciferase. proteins carrying phosphorylation sites characterized specific activity, pI, effect pH colour light emitted effect catalytic subunit protein kinase presence ATP. one recombinant proteins (RRFS) significantly different wild-type luciferase. RRFS mutant lower specific activity, lower pH optimum, emitted greener light low pH phosphorylated decreased activity 80%. latter effect reversed phosphatase. recombinant protein good candidate measure first time cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation live cells.
