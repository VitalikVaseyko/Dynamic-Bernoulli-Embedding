 Phytomonas serpens flagellates family Trypanosomatidae parasitise tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum L.), results fruits low commercial value. tomato glycoalkaloid tomatine aglycone tomatidine inhibit growth P. serpens axenic cultures. Tomatine, like many saponins, induces permeabilisation cell membrane loss cell content, including cytosolic enzyme pyruvate kinase. contrast, tomatidine cause permeabilisation membranes, instead provokes morphological changes, including vacuolisation. Phytomonas treated tomatidine show increased accumulation labelled neutral lipids (BODYPY-palmitic), notable decrease amount C24-alkylated sterols increase zymosterol content. results consistent inhibition 24-sterol methyltransferase (SMT), important enzyme responsible methylation sterols 24 position. propose main target tomatidine sterols biosynthetic pathway, specifically, inhibition 24-SMT. Altogether, results obtained present paper suggest general effect alkaloids trypanosomatids, opens potential therapeutic possibilities treatment diseases caused pathogens.
