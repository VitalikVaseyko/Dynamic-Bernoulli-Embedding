 Culture systems promote development rates lower vivo environment. Here, evaluated embryo's transcriptome determine embryo needs development. previous mRNA sequencing endeavour found upregulation solute carrier family 7 (cationic amino acid transporter, y+ system), member 1 (SLC7A1), arginine transporter, vitro- compared vivo-cultured embryos. present study, added different concentrations arginine culture medium meet needs porcine embryo. Increasing arginine 0.12 1.69mM improved number embryos developed blastocyst stage. blastocysts also total nuclei compared controls and, specifically, trophectoderm nuclei. Embryos cultured 1.69mM arginine lower SLC7A1 levels higher abundance messages involved glycolysis (hexokinase 1, hexokinase 2 glutamic pyruvate transaminase (alanine aminotransferase) 2) decreased expression genes involved blocking tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 1) pentose phosphate pathway (transaldolase 1). Expression protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) genes PRMT1, PRMT3 PRMT5 throughout development affected arginine. However, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) DDAH2 message found differentially regulated development, DDAH2 protein localised nuclei blastocysts. Arginine positive effect preimplantation development may affecting nitric oxide-DDAH-PRMT axis.
