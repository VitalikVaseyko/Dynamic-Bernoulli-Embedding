 Sepsis remains one leading causes death intensive care units. Although sepsis caused viral, fungal bacterial infection, dysregulated generalized host response ultimately leads severe dysfunction multiple organs death. concomitant profound metabolic changes characterized hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, profound transformations intracellular energy supply peripheral immune cells. hallmark early phases sepsis massive formation reactive oxygen (ROS; e.g., superoxide) well nitrogen (RNS; e.g., nitric oxide) species. Reactive carbonyl species (RCS) form third crucial group highly reactive metabolites, today focus interest sepsis. However, previously showed prospective observational clinical trial patients suffering septic shock characterized significant methylglyoxal (MG)-derived carbonyl stress, glyoxalase system downregulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. review, give detailed insight current state research regarding metabolic changes entail increased MG-production septicemia. Thus, point special role glyoxalase system context sepsis.
