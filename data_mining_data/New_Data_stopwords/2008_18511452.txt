 pyruvate kinase (PK) moderate thermophile, Geobacillus stearothermophilus, allosteric enzyme activated AMP ribose 5-phosphate fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), common activator PKs. extra C-terminal sequence (ECTS), contains highly conserved phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding motif, function structure remain unclear. elucidate structural characteristics effector-binding site ECTS, crystal structure C9S/C268S mutant enzyme determined 2.4 resolution. crystal belonged space group P6(2)22, unit cell parameters a, b = 145.97 A, c = 118.03 A. enzyme homotetramer overall domain structure similar previously solved structures except ECTS formed new domain (C' domain). structure C' domain closely resembled PEP binding domain maize pyruvate phosphate dikinase. sulphate ion found pocket effector-binding C domain. site corresponds 6-phosphate group-binding site yeast PK bound FBP seems effector-binding site. comparison structure putative effector-binding site FBP binding site yeast enzyme, structural basis effector specificity G. stearothermophilus PK discussed.
