 Tumorigenesis requires energy production via aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) malignant tumors. Recent research demonstrated pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) augmented tumors, especially non-oxidative part PPP controlled transketolase (TKT) enzyme reactions. One TKT isoform, transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1), specifically upregulated different human cancers, overexpression predicts poor patient survival. define function malignant progression, employed small interference RNA (siRNA) technique knockdown gene expression TKTL1 gastric cancer cell line AGS. used TKTL1 siRNA observe effect reduced TKTL1 expression gastric cancer tumorigenesis nude mice xenograft model proliferation vitro. results showed expression double stranded RNA led efficient specific inhibition endogenous TKTL1 expression AGS cells. addition, TKT activity significantly deceased TKTL1 siRNA-treated AGS cells. TKTL1 suppression resulted delayed cell proliferation vitro. Furthermore, loss TKTL1 inhibited growth AGS tumor xenografts. Altogether, findings indicate specific inhibition TKTL1 may important therapeutically.
