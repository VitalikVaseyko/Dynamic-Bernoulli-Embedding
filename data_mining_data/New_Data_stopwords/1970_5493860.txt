 1. Administration glucagon foetal rats produced 10-15-fold increase hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity together similar increase overall pathway pyruvate conversion glycogen liver slices. 2. Glucagon without effect gluconeogenesis vivo, remained approx. 0.1% incorporation measured newborn animals. 3. apparent discrepancy results due ether anaesthesia required experimentation vivo. conditions minimal ether used, rates labelling glycogen [3-(14)C]pyruvate vivo increased 10-20-fold additional stimulus glucagon. 4. Ether anaesthesia produced reduced redox state foetal liver cytosol lowered ATP/ADP concentration ratio. 5. proposed effects significant limitation gluconeogenesis foetal rat liver, high phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, high ATP concentration relatively oxidized cytosol redox state functional gluconeogenic pathway present.
