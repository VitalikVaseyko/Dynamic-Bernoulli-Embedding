 symmetry proteins composed identical polypeptide chains investigated means cross-linking bifunctional reagents subsequent sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. majority investigations performed diimidates different chain lengths (C3-C12), react exclusively amino groups. Aldolase, catalase, fumarase, pyruvate kinase, tetrameric proteins identical polypeptide chains, reveal D2 symmetry, i.e. appear composed two pairs polypeptide chains. validity conclusion demonstrated lactate dehydrogenase. enzyme, shown X-ray analysis D2 symmetry, yields cross-linking subsequent polyacrylamide electrophoresis band pattern expected protein quaternary structure similar pattern obtained enzymes. 2. influence experimental conditions cross-linking reaction investigated. selectivity bifunctional reagent different contact domains within quaternary structure protein depends reaction time, chain length concentration reagent. general D2 symmetry becomes obvious increasing chain length increasing concentration diimidate. Diethylpyrocarbonate showed little selectivity.
