 Pharmaceutical therapies non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) include plasma glucose lowering enhancing glucose utilization. mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex important controlling balance glucose fatty acid substrate oxidation. Administration pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitors (PDHKIs) rats effectively lowers plasma glucose results myocardial steatosis instances associated primarily atrial lesser degree ventricular pathology. Induction myocardial steatosis dose-dependent, varies minimal moderate severity, either multifocal diffuse distribution. Ventricular histopathology restricted myocardial degenerative fibers, atrium/atria either acute chronic appearance former showing myocardial degeneration/necrosis, acute myocarditis, edema, endothelial activation (rounding up), endocarditis, thrombosis associated moderate myocardial steatosis latter myocardial loss, replacement fibrosis, apparent minimal association steatosis. evidence evaluations indicate excessive intramyocardial accumulation lipid may either primarily adverse represents indicator adversely affected cellular processes.
