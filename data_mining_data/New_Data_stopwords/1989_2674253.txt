 Intracellular glycolytic regulating enzyme activities, pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK), adenylate kinase (AK), energy charge (Ech), free amino acids (ICAA), protein synthesis (PS) measured polymorphonuclear leukocytes--used cell model--in 62 adults 12 children chronic renal failure, 66 normal adults 21 children comparison controls. normal subjects, children significantly lower enzyme activities cell amino acid levels similar Ech higher PS adults. ICAA concentrations significantly higher plasma amino acid concentrations (PAA) groups, PAA correlated with, indicative of, ICAA concentrations. variance (R2) PS could largely accounted combination ("set") six ICAA, determined multivariate analysis. sets differed children vs adults, suggesting different proteins synthesized. uremic patients, reduced PF, PFK, Ech, ICAAs PS indicative cellular malnutrition. uremic adults, abnormalities cell metabolism modified therapy--nondialyzed uremics worst, CAPD patients best approximately normal, hemodialyzed intermediate. uremic CAPD children reduced, PK, PFK, AK, ICAA, PS. Ech increased. Cellular malnutrition children chronic renal failure may contribute poor growth.
