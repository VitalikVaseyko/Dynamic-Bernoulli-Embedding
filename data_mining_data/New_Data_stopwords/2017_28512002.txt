 Mitochondria sites pyruvate oxidation, citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, ketogenesis, fatty acid oxidation. Attenuation mitochondrial function one significant changes occurs tumor cells, directly linked oncogenesis, angiogenesis, Warburg effect, epigenetics. particular, three mitochondrial enzymes inactivated cancer: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase-2 (HMGCS2). enzymes subject regulation via acetylation/deacetylation. SIRT3, predominant mitochondrial deacetylase, directly targets enzymes deacetylation maintains optimal catalytic activity. SIRT3 tumor suppressor, deacetylation enzymes contributes biological function. PDH catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate acetyl CoA, SDH oxidizes succinate fumarate, HMGCS2 controls synthesis ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate. activities enzymes decreased cancer, tumor cells accumulate lactate succinate produce less amounts beta-hydroxybutyrate. Apart role cellular energetics, metabolites function signaling molecules via specific cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptors. Lactate signals via GPR81, succinate via GPR91, beta-hydroxybutyrate via GPR109A. addition, lactate activates hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1alpha succinate promotes DNA methylation. GPR81 GPR91 tumor promoters, increased production lactate succinate agonists drives tumorigenesis enhancing signaling via two receptors. contrast, GPR109A tumor suppressor, decreased synthesis beta-hydroxybutyrate agonist suppresses signaling via receptor, thus attenuating tumor-suppressing function GPR109A. parallel opposing changes lactate/succinate beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, tumor cells upregulate GPR81 GPR91 downregulate GPR109A. such, three metabolite receptors play critical role cancer represent new class drug targets selective antagonists GPR81 GPR91 cancer treatment agonists GPR109A cancer prevention.
