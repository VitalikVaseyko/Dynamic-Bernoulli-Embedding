 Insulin binding erythrocytes shown lack relationship age-related factors erythrocyte pyruvate kinase activity reticulocyte count individuals normal erythropoiesis. density separation erythrocytes normal adults children individuals increased erythropoiesis, correlation age-factors evident (pyruvate kinase activity/insulin binding r = 0.59, p less 0.01, reticulocyte count/insulin binding r = 0.44, p less 0.01). estimate components variation binding showed unexplained variance 60%. density separated samples insulin binding correlated closer pyruvate kinase activity number reticulocytes. treatment haematopoietic diseases 4 patients increased erythropoiesis, disappearance rate reticulocyte count much faster (T 1/2 = 9 days) insulin binding erythrocytes (T 1/2 = 37 days) pyruvate kinase activity (T 1/2 = 36 days). one patient studied splenectomy, decrease insulin binding paralleled disappearance curve 51Cr-tagged erythrocytes. results suggest insulin binds erythrocytes, reticulocyte stage, throughout life span, though binding, closely related pyruvate kinase activity, steadily declines erythrocytes age.
