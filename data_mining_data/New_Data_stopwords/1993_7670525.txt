 enzyme pyruvate kinase Leishmania mexicana amazonensis presents two forms different kinetic properties behavior heterotrophic activator fructose 2,6 bisphosphate. Pyruvate kinase 1, isolated tetramer, inhibited metabolite. second activity, Pyruvate kinase 2, activated fructose 2,6 bisphosphate, promotes monomer-tetramer conversion enzyme.
