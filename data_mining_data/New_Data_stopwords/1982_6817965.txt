 1. vitro glucose uptake glycogen utilization Hymenolepis microstoma decreased high oxygen concentrations. 2. 5-Hydroxytryptamine stimulate vitro glucose uptake increase glycogen utilizations H. microstoma. 3. reduced glucose uptake high oxygen concentrations (21 95%) resulted reduction excretory products. 4. 14CO2-incorporation studies confirmed that, 95% O2:5% CO2 air-minus-CO2 (identical 21% O2). CO2-fixation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) inhibited. 5. specific activity hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) stimulated 5-HT. 6. concentration ATP required optimal stimulation phosphofructokinase activity 0.67 mM. Activity significantly increased addition cAMP even greater AMP.
