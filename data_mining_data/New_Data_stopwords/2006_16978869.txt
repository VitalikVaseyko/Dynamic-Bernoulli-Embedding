 Parkinson disease (PD) second-most common age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized selective destruction dopaminergic neurons. Increasing evidence indicates oxidative stress plays crucial role pathogenesis idiopathic PD. Anti-oxidant agents including catalase, manganese porphyrin pyruvate confer cytoprotection different cell cultures challenged 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Herein used rat cerebellar granular cell cultures ascertain plausible cellular pathways involved pyruvate-induced cytoprotection 0.1 mM 6-OHDA. Pyruvate provided cytoprotection concentration-dependent manner (2-10 mM). Consistent well-established anti-oxidant capacity, pyruvate (10 mM) prevented 6-OHDA-induced lipid peroxidation blocking rise intracellular peroxides maintaining intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. experiments revealed pyruvate increased Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors attenuated pyruvate-induced cytoprotection indicating PI3K-mediated Akt activation necessary pyruvate induce cytoprotection. hand, pyruvate also up-regulated glutathione peroxidase mRNA levels, anti-oxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase-1 -2, catalase anti-apoptotic oncogenes Bcl-2 Bcl-xL. summary, results strongly suggest pyruvate, besides anti-oxidant properties related structure, exerts cytoprotective actions activating different anti-apoptotic routes include gene regulation Akt pathway activation.
