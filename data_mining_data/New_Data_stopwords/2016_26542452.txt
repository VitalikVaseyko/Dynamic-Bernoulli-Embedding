 Gefitinib (Iressa, ZD-1839), small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, currently investigation clinical trials treatment colorectal cancer (CRC). However, known, patients develop resistance TKIs, mechanisms mediating intrinsic resistance EGFR-TKIs CRC fully characterized. Resistance EGFR inhibitors reportedly involves activation signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3) glioma lung cancer. Here, demonstrated nuclear pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) levels positively correlated gefitinib resistance CRC cells. overexpression nuclear PKM2 HT29 cells decreased effect gefitinib therapy, whereas PKM2 knockdown increased gefitinib efficacy. Furthermore, activation STAT3 nuclear PKM2 associated gefitinib resistance. Inhibition STAT3 Stattic, STAT3-specific inhibitor, STAT3-specific siRNA sensitized resistant cells gefitinib. results suggest nuclear PKM2 modulates sensitivity CRC cells gefitinib indicate small molecule pharmacological disruption nuclear PKM2 association STAT3 potential avenue overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance CRC patients.
