 Previous work demonstrated acetate production substantially lower pyruvate kinase (pyk) mutant Bacillus subtilis. significantly lower acetate production pyk mutant hypothesized positive effect recombinant protein production either lifting inhibitory effect acetate accumulation medium redirecting metabolic fluxes beneficial biomass/protein synthesis. study, impact pyk mutation recombinant protein production investigated. Green fluorescent protein (GFP+) selected model protein constitutively expressed wild-type strain pyk mutant. batch cultures, pyk mutant produced 3-fold higher levels recombinant protein grown glucose carbon source. Experimental measurements theoretical analysis show higher protein yield mutant due removal acetate-associated inhibition expression gene dosage protein stability much lower acetate production mutant allows greater fraction carbon intake directed protein synthesis.
