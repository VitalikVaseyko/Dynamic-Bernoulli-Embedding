 Signal transducer activator transcription (STAT) 3 regulates many cardinal features cancer including cancer cell growth, apoptosis resistance, DNA damage response, metastasis, immune escape, tumor angiogenesis, Warburg effect oncogene addiction validated drug target cancer therapy. Several strategies used identify agents target Stat3 breast cancer none yet entered clinical use. used high-throughput fluorescence microscopy search strategy identify compounds drug-repositioning library (Prestwick library) block ligand-induced nuclear translocation Stat3 identified piperlongumine (PL), natural product isolated fruit pepper Piper longum. PL inhibited Stat3 nuclear translocation, inhibited ligand-induced constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation, modulated expression multiple Stat3-regulated genes. Surface plasmon resonance assay revealed PL directly inhibited binding Stat3 phosphotyrosyl peptide ligand. Phosphoprotein antibody array analysis revealed PL modulate kinases known activate Stat3 Janus kinases, Src kinase family members receptor tyrosine kinases. PL inhibited anchorage-independent anchorage-dependent growth multiple breast cancer cell lines increased pStat3 total Stat3, induced apoptosis. PL also inhibited mammosphere formation tumor cells patient-derived xenografts. PL's antitumorigenic function causally linked Stat3-inhibitory effect. PL non-toxic mice dose 30 mg/kg/day 14 days caused regression breast cancer cell line xenografts nude mice. Thus, PL represents promising new agent rapid entry clinic use treating breast cancer, well cancers Stat3 role.
