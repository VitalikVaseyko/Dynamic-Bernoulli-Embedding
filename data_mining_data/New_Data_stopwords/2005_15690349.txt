 present work LC-MS/MS applied measure concentrations intermediates glycolysis TCA cycle autonomous, cell-cycle synchronized oscillations aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures Saccharomyces cerevisiae. study complements previously reported oscillations carbon dioxide production rate, intracellular concentrations trehalose various free amino acids, extracellular acetate pyruvate culture. glycolytic intermediates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 2- 3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate show pronounced oscillatory behavior, latter three compounds oscillating phase former. agrees previously observed metabolic control phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Although individually clearly oscillating, several intermediates TCA cycle, i.e., alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, exhibited increasing concentration cell cycle phase high carbon flux glycolysis TCA cycle. average mass action ratios beta-phosphoglucomutase fumarase agreed well previously determined vitro equilibrium constants. Minor differences resulted phosphoglucose isomerase enolase. Together observed close correlation pool sizes involved metabolites, might indicate that, vivo, reactions operating close equilibrium, whereby care must taken due possible differences vivo vitro conditions. Combining data previously determined intracellular amino acid levels culture, clear correlations catabolism anabolism could identified: phosphoglycerate/serine alpha-ketoglutarate/lysine exhibited correlated oscillatory behavior, albeit different phase shifts. Oscillations intracellular amino acids might therefore be, least partly, following oscillations anabolic precursors.
