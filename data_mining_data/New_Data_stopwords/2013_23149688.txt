 frequent post-translational modification, protein phosphorylation regulates many cellular processes. Although several hundred phosphorylation sites mapped metabolic enzymes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, functionality demonstrated them. Here, describe novel approach identify vivo functionality enzyme phosphorylation combining flux analysis proteomics phosphoproteomics. Focusing network 204 enzymes constitute yeast central carbon amino-acid metabolism, combined protein phosphoprotein levels identify 35 enzymes change degree phosphorylation growth five conditions. Correlations previously determined intracellular fluxes phosphoprotein abundances provided first functional evidence five novel phosphoregulated enzymes network, adding nine known phosphoenzymes. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 alpha subunit Pda1 newly identified phosphoregulated glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Gpd1 phosphofructose-1-kinase complex beta subunit Pfk2, validated functionality specific phosphosites absolute peptide quantification targeted mass spectrometry, metabolomics physiological flux analysis mutants genetically removed phosphosites. results demonstrate role phosphorylation controlling metabolic flux realised three enzymes.
