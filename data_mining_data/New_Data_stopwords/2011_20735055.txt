 Progress curve analysis used sparingly studies enzyme-catalyzed reactions due largely complexity integrated rate expressions used data analysis. Using experimental design simplifies analysis, advantages limitations progress curve experiments explored study four different enzyme-catalyzed reactions. approach involves relatively simple protocols, requires 20-25% materials, provides 10- 20-fold signal enhancements compared analogous initial rate studies. Product inhibition, complicates integrated rate analysis, circumvented using cloned, purified enzymes remove products draw reaction forward. resulting progress curves transformed equivalent thousands initial rate [S] measurements and, due absence product inhibition, plotted familiar, linear double-reciprocal format. Allowing product accumulate reaction produces continuously changing substrate/product ratio used basis obtaining product inhibition constants distinguish among three classical inhibition mechanisms. Algebraic models describing double-reciprocal patterns obtained inhibition studies presented. virtual continuum substrate concentrations occurs progress curve experiment provides nearly errorless set relative concentrations results remarkably precise data; kinetic constant standard deviations order 0.5%.
