 previously proposed 2-ketobutyrate alarmone Escherichia coli. Circumstantial evidence suggested target 2-ketobutyrate phosphoenol pyruvate: glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS). demonstrate phosphorylated metabolites glycolytic pathway experience dramatic downshift upon addition 2-ketobutyrate (or analogues). particular, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate acetyl-CoA concentrations drop factor 10, 3, 4, 5 respectively. result consistent (i) inhibition PTS 2-ketobutyrate, (ii) control metabolism fructose-1,6-diphosphate. Since fructose-1,6-diphosphate activator phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase, concentration common substrate, phosphoenol pyruvate, decrease parallel.
