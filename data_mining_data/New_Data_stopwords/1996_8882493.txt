 Plasma 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) concentration decreased significantly (P < 0.05), 1-5 days captivity, levels freshly caught dogfish shark Squalus acanthias. short-term effects T3 treatment intermediary metabolism S. acanthias measured gill, kidney, liver, white muscle. Animals kept 1-5 days experimentation. Three hours intraperitoneal injection either low T3 dose (8.3 pmol T3/kg fish) high T3 dose (830 pmol T3/kg fish), selected enzymes amino acid metabolism, lipid catabolism, ketone body metabolism, glycolysis, oxidative metabolism measured. Activity enzymes amino acid metabolism lipid catabolism increased significantly (P < 0.05) liver fish treated low T3 dose. low dose T3 apparently influences glycolysis pyruvate kinase activity significantly increase (P < 0.05) kidney white muscle.
