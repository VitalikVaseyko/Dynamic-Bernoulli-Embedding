 examined hypothesis human erythrocyte isozyme pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) hybrid two isozymes present liver. Rabbit antiserum purified human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase inactivates erythrocyte isozyme major liver isozyme human tissue inactivate minor liver isozyme. electrophoretic mobilities erythrocyte major liver isozymes altered anti-erythrocyte enzyme antibody mobility minor liver isozyme unaffected. Gel diffusion analysis indicates cross-reactivity erythrocyte major liver isozyme cross-reactivity minor liver isozyme. hybrid hypothesis would predict cross-reactivity including changes activity mobility isozymes conclude, therefore hypothesis incorrect.
