 1. order assess whether potential ability heart ventricular muscle liver metabolise substrates alanine, aspartate lactate varies sheep matures nutrition changes, activities following enzymes determined tissues lambs obtained varying intervals 50 days conception 16 weeks birth livers adult pregnant ewes: lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP)(EC 4.1.1.32), malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) citrate (si)-synthase (EC 4.1.3.7). 2. heart marked increase alanine aminotransferase activity found throughout development. period activities citrate (si)-synthase, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate carboxylase also increased. substantial changes activities aspartate aminotransferase, malate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinase activities five times greater heart compared found liver. significant activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) detected heart muscle. 3. liver activities alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase increased immediately following birth although activity alanine aminotransferase lower livers pregnant ewes lambs. alanine aminotransferase highest activities lactate dehydrogenase found period postnatal growth. marked changes observed malate dehydrogenase citrate (si)-synthase activities development. small decline pyruvate kinase activity occurred whilst activities pyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) tended rise development.
