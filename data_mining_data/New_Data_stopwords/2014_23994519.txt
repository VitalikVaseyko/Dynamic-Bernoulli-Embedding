 BACKGROUND: present study tested hypothesis lifelong resveratrol (RSV) supplementation counteracts age-associated decrease skeletal muscle oxidative capacity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha RSV combined lifelong exercise training (EX) exerts additive effects PGC-1alpha mice. METHODS: 3 month old PGC-1alpha whole body knockout (KO) wild type (WT) littermate mice placed cages without running wheel fed either standard chow standard chow RSV supplementation (4 g/kg food) 12 months. Young (3 months age), sedentary mice standard chow served young controls. graded running performance test glucose tolerance test performed 2 1 week, respectively, euthanization quadriceps extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles removed. RESULTS: PGC-1alpha KO mice, quadriceps citrate synthase (CS) activity, mitochondrial (mt)DNA content well pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E1alpha, cytochrome (Cyt) c vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein content 20-75% lower and, EDL capillary-to-fiber (C:F) ratio 15-30% lower WT mice. RSV and/or EX effect C:F ratio EDL. CS activity (P=0.063) mtDNA content (P=0.013) decreased age WT mice, CS activity, mtDNA content, PDH-E1alpha protein VEGF protein increased ~1.5-1.8-fold lifelong EX WT, PGC-1alpha KO mice, RSV alone significant effect proteins. CONCLUSION: Lifelong EX increased activity/content oxidative proteins, mtDNA angiogenic proteins skeletal muscle PGC-1alpha, RSV supplementation alone effect. Combining lifelong EX RSV supplementation additional effect skeletal muscle oxidative angiogenic proteins.
