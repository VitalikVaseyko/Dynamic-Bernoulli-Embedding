 Localization different enzymes PEP-succinate pathway done Setaria cervi, bovine filarial worm. Succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase localized mitochondria rich particulate fraction enzymes cytosolic. vitro effect certain antifilarial/anthelmintic agents enzymes also investigated. Sumarmin, low concentration, could cause marked inhibition enzymes pathway. Centperazine, antifilarial drug developed CDRI showed significant inhibitory action pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, fumarase succinate dehydrogenase CDRI compound 72/70 showed significant inhibition PEP-carboxykinase activity. Diethylcarbamazine levamisole, however, found less ineffective lower concentrations enzymes pathway.
