 Starvation diabetes increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) expression, conserves gluconeogenic substrates inactivating pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Mechanisms regulate PDK4 gene expression, previously established increased glucocorticoids decreased insulin, studied. Treatment HepG2 cells dexamethasone increases relative abundance PDK4 mRNA, insulin blocks effect. Dexamethasone also increases human PDK4 (hPDK4) promoter activity HepG2 cells, insulin partially inhibits effect. Expression constitutively active PKB alpha abrogates dexamethasone stimulation hPDK4 promoter activity, coexpression constitutively active FOXO1a FOXO3a, mutated alanine three phosphorylation sites protein kinase B (PKB), disrupts ability PKB alpha inhibit promoter activity. glucocorticoid response element glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding three insulin response sequences (IRSs) bind FOXO1a FOXO3a identified hPDK4 promoter. Mutation IRSs reduces ability glucocorticoids stimulate PDK4 transcription. Transfection studies E1A, binds inactivates p300/CBP, suggest interactions p300/CBP GR well FOXO factors important glucocorticoid-stimulated hPDK4 expression. Insulin suppresses hPDK4 induction glucocorticoids inactivation FOXO factors.
