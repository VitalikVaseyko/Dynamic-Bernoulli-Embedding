 Melanoma malignant tumor UVA (320-400 nm) radiation considered important risk factor. role UVA melanoma progression toward invasive phenotype still adequately investigated. proliferating tumor cells preference aerobic glycolysis described Warburg effect. investigate effect UVA irradiation changes Warburg effect tumor progression toward invasive potential. UVA irradiation, melanoma cell lines initial tumors show induction Warburg effect increased glucose consumption lactate production, least partially mediated reactive oxygen species. Associated UVA treatment enhanced lactic acid production, tumor-relevant proteases situ invasion upregulated. Simultaneously, UVA increases intracellular concentrations progression marker transketolase activated protein kinase Akt, involved metabolic changes increase proliferation. Using invasion assays show lactic acid, resulting UVA enhanced partially reactive oxygen species-mediated Warburg effect, increases invasive potential melanoma cell lines investigated. Therefore, demonstrate melanoma cells production lactic acid, induced UVA irradiation, increases invasiveness melanoma cells via expression tumor-relevant proteases.
