 effects ischemia mitochondrial function unidirectional rate ATP synthesis (Pi----ATP rate) studied using Langendorff-perfused heart preparation 31P NMR spectroscopy. significant postischemic depression mechanical function assessed heart rate pressure product, myocardial oxygen consumption rate given rate pressure product elevated. Experiments performed glucose- pyruvate-perfused hearts demonstrated presence large contribution unidirectional Pi----ATP rate catalyzed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphoglycerate kinase. rate much greater maximal glucose utilization rate myocardium, demonstrating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/phosphoglycerate kinase reactions near equilibrium ischemia. pyruvate-perfused postischemic hearts, glycolytic contribution eliminated net rate ATP synthesis oxidative phosphorylation measurable. Despite reduced mechanical function increased myocardial oxygen consumption rate, ratio net rate ATP synthesis oxidative phosphorylation oxygen consumption rate (the P:O ratio) altered subsequent ischemia (2.34 +/- 0.12 2.36 +/- 0.09 normal postischemic hearts, respectively). Therefore, mitochondrial uncoupling cannot cause postischemic depression mechanical function; instead, data suggest existence ischemia-induced inefficiency ATP utilization.
