 Many cancer cells rely aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation catabolize glucose high rate. metabolic switch suggested due part functional attenuation mitochondria cancer cells. However, oncogenic signals attenuate mitochondrial function promote switch glycolysis remains unclear. previously reported tyrosine phosphorylation activates inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) phosphatase (PDP), respectively, leading enhanced inhibitory serine phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) consequently inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) cancer cells. particular, Tyr-381 phosphorylation PDP1 dissociates deacetylase SIRT3 recruits acetyltransferase ACAT1 PDC, resulting increased inhibitory lysine acetylation PDHA1 PDP1. report phosphorylation another tyrosine residue, Tyr-94, inhibits PDP1 reducing binding ability PDP1 lipoic acid, covalently attached L2 domain dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) recruit PDP1 PDC. found multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylated PDP1 Tyr-94, Tyr-94 phosphorylation PDP1 common diverse human cancer cells primary leukemia cells patients. Moreover, expression phosphorylation-deficient PDP1 Y94F mutant cancer cells resulted increased oxidative phosphorylation, decreased cell proliferation hypoxia, reduced tumor growth mice. Together, findings suggest phosphorylation different tyrosine residues inhibits PDP1 independent mechanisms, act concert regulate PDC activity promote Warburg effect.
