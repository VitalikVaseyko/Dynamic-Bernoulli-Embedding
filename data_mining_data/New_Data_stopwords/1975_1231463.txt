 Since glycogen overloading one outstanding features diabetic liver, series investigations undertaken find enzymatic explanation feature. Three groups patients studied: non diabetics submitted liver biopsy surgery (group A); non diabetics submitted percutaneous liver biopsy (group B). groups G-6-PDH, PK MDH assayed, adaptive enzymes intermediate metabolism. Results expressed muU/100 mg proteins. significant finding comparison two groups low concentration enzymes surgical biopsies. depression G-6-PDH concentration 10 times less surgical specimens compared percutaneous ones, whereas PK almost 10 times less. view findings surgically obtained biopsy material used study. third group (C) included insulin-dependent diabetics good metabolic control percutaneous liver biopsies obtained assay enzymes order compare results group B. three enzymes diminished diabetics, difference statistically significant G-6-PDH PK, MDH view wide dispersion values found. Comparison analysis results lead conclusion view low concentration enzymes diabetics, glucose utilization liver cell must presumed increased via metabolic pathways.
