 isolated purified cardiac myofibrillar sarcolemmal preparations, route movement ADP produced Mg2+-ATPase reactions studied investigating efficiency competition endogenous creatine kinase exogenous pyruvate kinase reactions. homogeneous control system composed hexokinase glucose ATPase, soluble creatine kinase rapidly rephosphorylated ADP produced presence 1 mM ATP, addition pyruvate kinase increasing amount inhibited reaction creatine release phosphocreatine symmetrically increased rate pyruvate production phosphoenol pyruvate. pyruvate-kinase/creatine-kinase activity ratio (PK/CK) 50, ADP used pyruvate kinase. myofibrillar sarcolemmal preparations containing particulate creatine kinase, creatine kinase reaction much less efficiently suppressed pyruvate kinase, PK/CK = 50 half-maximal release creatine still observed. rate immediate myofibrillar MgADP rephosphorylation endogenous creatine-kinase reaction observed governed concentration phosphocreatine accordance kinetics enzyme. physiological significance findings discussed.
