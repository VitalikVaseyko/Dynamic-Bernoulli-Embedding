 Proliferating cells reduce oxidative metabolism rely glycolysis, even presence O2 (Warburg effect). shift metabolism reduces citrate biosynthesis diminishes intracellular acidity, promote glycolysis sustaining tumor growth. citrate donor acetyl-CoA, reduced production favors deacetylation state proteins favoring resistance apoptosis epigenetic changes, processes contributing tumor aggressiveness. Citrate levels could monitored indicator cancer aggressiveness (as already shown human prostate cancer) and/or could serve biomarker response therapy. Strategies aiming increase cytosolic citrate developed tested humans, knowing experimental studies shown administration citrate and/or inhibition ACLY arrest tumor growth, inhibit expression key anti-apoptotic factor Mcl-1, reverse cell dedifferentiation increase sensibility cisplatin.
