 BACKGROUND: E. coli cells rich thiamine, form cofactor thiamine diphosphate (ThDP). Free ThDP precursor two triphosphorylated derivatives, thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) newly discovered adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP). While, ThTP accumulation requires oxidation carbon source, AThTP slowly accumulates response carbon starvation, reaching approximately 15% total thiamine. Here, address question whether AThTP accumulation E. coli triggered absence carbon source medium, resulting drop energy charge forms metabolic stress. RESULTS: minimal M9 medium, E. coli cells produce AThTP energy substrates lacking also metabolization inhibited. Thus AThTP accumulates presence glucose, glycolysis blocked iodoacetate, presence lactate, respiration blocked cyanide anoxia. cases, ATP synthesis impaired, AThTP accumulation appear direct consequence reduced ATP levels. Indeed, CV2 E. coli strain (containing thermolabile adenylate kinase), ATP content low 37 degrees C, even presence metabolizable substrates (glucose lactate) conditions, cells produce ThTP AThTP. Furthermore, show ThTP inhibits AThTP accumulation. Therefore, conclude low energy charge sufficient trigger AThTP accumulation latter accumulate conditions ThTP synthesized. show AThTP production also induced uncoupler CCCP but, unexpectedly, requires presence pyruvate substrate yielding pyruvate (such D-glucose L-lactate). conditions described, AThTP production different RelA SpoT mutants used. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli, AThTP accumulates response two different conditions metabolic stress: lack energy substrates (or inhibition metabolization) uncoupled pyruvate oxidation. conditions prevent bacterial growth. obvious link stringent response catabolite repression.
