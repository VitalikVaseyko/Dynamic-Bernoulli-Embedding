 Na(+)-K(+) pumps transverse tubular (T) system muscle fiber play vital role keeping K(+) concentration T-system sufficiently low activity prevent chronic depolarization consequent loss excitability. Na(+)-K(+) pumps located triad junction, key transduction zone controlling excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, region rich glycolytic enzymes likely high localized ATP usage limited substrate diffusion. study examined whether Na(+)-K(+) pump function dependent ATP derived via glycolytic pathway locally within triad region. Single fibers rat fast-twitch muscle mechanically skinned, sealing T-system retaining normal EC coupling. Intracellular composition set bathing solution action potentials (APs) triggered T-system, eliciting intracellular Ca(2+) release twitch tetanic force responses. Conditions selected increased Na(+)-K(+) pump function could detected consequent increase T-system polarization resultant faster rate AP repriming. Na(+)-K(+) pump function adequately supported maintaining cytoplasmic ATP concentration normal resting level ( approximately 8 mM), even 10 40 mM creatine phosphate present. Addition little 1 mM phospho(enol)pyruvate resulted marked increase Na(+)-K(+) pump function, supported endogenous pyruvate kinase bound within triad. results demonstrate triad junction highly restricted microenvironment, glycolytic resynthesis ATP critical meet high demand Na(+)-K(+) pump maintain muscle excitability.
