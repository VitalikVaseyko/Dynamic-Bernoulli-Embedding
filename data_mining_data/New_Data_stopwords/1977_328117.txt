 Proflavine (PF) inhibited glucose use sensitive resistant Escherichia coli B. Glucose transport (as measured alpha-methylglucoside accumulation) partly inhibited PF concentration completely blocked glucose use. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate-(FDP)-regulated pyruvate kinase (PK1) (EC 2.7.1.40), glycolytic enzyme affected PF, completely inhibited dye concentration 0.8 mM. inhibition curve PF sigmoidal, suggesting PF acting allosteric inhibitor. PF increased K 1/2 phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) lowered V; however, effect Hill number PEP. PF inhibition partially reversed FDP cyclic AMP, AMP, ATP, fuctose 6-phosphate, dithiothreitol. Studies variety acridines indicated substituted 3-position effective inhibitors also hydrophobic interactions may involved PF inhibition PK I. PK E. coli B/Pr also strongly inhibited PF, indicating PF resistance lie level enzyme. Ribose-5-phosphate-regulated pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) much less sensitive PK inhibitory effects PF. role PF molecular probe PK proposed.
