 pathways glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) generation glyceride synthesis examined precision-cut liver slices fasted diabetic rats. incorporation 5 mM [U-(14)C]glucose glyceride-glycerol, used evaluate G3P generation via glycolysis, reduced approximately 26-36% liver slices fasted diabetic rats. glycolytic flux reduced approximately 60% groups. incorporation 1.0 mM [2-(14)C]pyruvate glyceride-glycerol (glyceroneogenesis) increased approximately 50% approximately 36% slices fasted diabetic rats, respectively, also showed two-fold increase activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. increased incorporation 1.0 mM [2-(14)C]pyruvate glyceride-glycerol slices fasted rats affected addition 5 mM glucose incubation medium. activity glycerokinase incorporation 1 mM [U-(14)C]glycerol glyceride-glycerol, evaluators G3P formation direct glycerol phosphorylation, differ significantly controls slices two experimental groups. Rates incorporation 1 mM [2-(14)C]pyruvate [U-(14)C]glycerol glucose incubation medium (gluconeogenesis) approximately 140 approximately 20% higher fasted diabetic slices control slices. could estimated glyceroneogenesis liver slices fasted rats contributed approximately 20% G3P generated glyceride-glycerol synthesis, glycolytic pathway approximately 5%, direct phosphorylation glycerol glycerokinase approximately 75%. Pyruvate contributed 54% glycerol 46% gluconeogenesis. present data indicate glyceroneogenesis significant participation generation G3P needed increased glyceride-glycerol synthesis liver fasting diabetes.
