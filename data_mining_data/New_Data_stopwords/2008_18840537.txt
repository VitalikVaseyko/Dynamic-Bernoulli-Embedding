 Although seasonal metabolic variation ectothermic tetrapods investigated primarily context species showing level metabolic depression winter, several species anurans maintain activity patterns throughout year tropical subtropical areas. tree-frog Hypsiboas prasinus occurs subtropical Atlantic Forest remains reproductively active winter, temperatures 10 degrees C. compared males calling summer winter, found males H. prasinus exhibit seasonal adjustments metabolic morphometric variables. Individuals calling winter larger showed higher resting metabolic rates calling summer. Calling rates affected season. Winter animals showed lower liver heart activity level citrate synthase (CS), partially compensated larger liver mass. Winter individuals also showed higher activity pyruvate kinase (PK) lower activity CS trunk muscles, higher activity CS leg muscles. Winter metabolic adjustments seem achieved compensatory mechanisms lower environmental temperature seasonally oriented aerobic depression several organs. impact seasonal metabolic changes calling performance capacity subtropical anurans metabolic thermal acclimatization also discussed.
