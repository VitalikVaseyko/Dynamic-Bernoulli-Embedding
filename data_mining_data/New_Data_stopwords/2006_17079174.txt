 Walker Warburg syndrome (WWS) severe group multiple congenital disorders known lissencephaly type II ( LIS Type II) associated congenital muscular dystrophy eye abnormalities. POMT1 gene frequently affected found 20% patients WWS. describe five fetuses WWS three non-related families carrying mutation POMT1 gene. fetuses presented tetra ventricular hydrocephaly, arachnoidal neuroglial ectopia cortical dysplasia characteristic LIS type II. performed sequencing POMT1 gene fetal DNA. five fetuses found share insertion inversed Alu repeated DNA element within exon 3 POMT1 gene, heterozygous state except one homozygous state. mutation associated common transition c.2203 C > (p.Arg735Cys) exon 20 allele similar intragenic haplotype, suggesting three families could related indicating possible founder effect France. Insertions Alu sequences, rarely found coding regions, occasionally reported cause genetic diseases. However, first report retrotransposon insertion POMT1 gene associated WWS.
