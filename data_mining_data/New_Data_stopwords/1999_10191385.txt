 Many attempts engineer cellular metabolism failed due complexity cellular functions. Mathematical computational methods needed organize available experimental information, provide insight guidance successful metabolic engineering. Two methods reviewed here. methods employ (log)linear kinetic model metabolism constructed based enzyme kinetics characteristics. first method allows description dynamic responses metabolic systems subject spatiotemporal variations parameters. second method considers product-oriented, constrained optimization metabolic reaction networks using mixed-integer linear programming methods. optimization framework used order identify combinations metabolic characteristics glycolytic enzymes yeast bacteria maximize ethanol production. methods also applied design microbial ethanol production metabolism. results calculations qualitative agreement experimental data presented here. Experiments calculations suggest that, resting Escherichia coli cells, ethanol production glucose uptake rates increased 30% 20%, respectively, overexpression deregulated pyruvate kinase, increase phosphofructokinase expression levels effect ethanol production glucose uptake rates.
