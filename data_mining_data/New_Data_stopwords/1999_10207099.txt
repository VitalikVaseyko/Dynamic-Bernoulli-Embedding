 transcription genes encoding proteins involved hepatic synthesis lipids glucose strongly stimulated carbohydrate feeding. well established liver, glucose main activator expression group genes, insulin permissive role. ADD1/SREBP-1 implicated lipogenic gene expression temporal association food intake ectopic gain-of-function experiments, genetic evidence requirement factor glucose-mediated gene expression established. show transcription ADD1/SREBP-1c primary cultures hepatocytes controlled positively insulin negatively glucagon cyclic AMP, establishing link transcription factor carbohydrate availability. Using adenovirus-mediated transfection powerful dominant negative form ADD1/SREBP-1c rat hepatocytes, demonstrate factor absolutely necessary stimulation glucose L-pyruvate kinase, fatty acid synthase, S14, acetyl coenzyme carboxylase gene expression. results demonstrate ADD1/SREBP-1c plays crucial role mediating expression lipogenic genes induced glucose insulin.
