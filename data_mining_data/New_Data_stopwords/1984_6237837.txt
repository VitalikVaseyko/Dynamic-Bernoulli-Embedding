 activities phosphofructokinase, aldolase pyruvate kinase diminished extracts skeletal muscle streptozotocin diabetic rats, whereas activities glucose phosphate isomerase phosphoglucomutase changed. Treatment diabetic rats insulin restored activity phosphofructokinase normal. kinetic study partially purified enzyme normal diabetic rats showed identical Michaelis constants ATP equal sensitivity inhibition excess substrate. Extracts quick frozen muscle diabetic rats higher levels citrate (an inhibitor phosphofructokinase) lower levels D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate D-glucose-1,6-bisphosphate (activators enzyme). levels D-fructose-6-phosphate, D-glucose-6-phosphate, ATP, ADP AMP two groups. data suggest vivo decrease phosphofructokinase activity skeletal muscle diabetic rats due decrease level enzymatically active protein well unfavorable change level several allosteric modulators.
