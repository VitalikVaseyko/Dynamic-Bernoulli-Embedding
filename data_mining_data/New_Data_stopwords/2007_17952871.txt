 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency rare red cell glycolytic enzymopathy. purpose present investigation offer prenatal diagnosis PK deficiency couple previous child severe enzyme deficiency congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. PK deficiency identified family assaying enzyme activity red cells. Chorionic villus sampling performed 11-week gestation mutation located exon 10 PKLR gene characterized polymerase chain reaction using restriction endonuclease digestion MspI enzyme, confirmed DNA sequencing ABI 310 DNA sequencer. parents heterozygous 1436G-->A [479 Arg-->His] mutation exon 10 proband homozygous mutation. fetus also heterozygous mutation pregnancy continued. Prenatal diagnosis allowed parents severely affected child PK deficiency reproductive choice fetus tested subsequent pregnancy.
