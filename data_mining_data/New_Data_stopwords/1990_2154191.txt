 mechanism responsible insulin resistance described vivo brown adipose tissue (BAT) lactating rats investigated. effect insulin glucose metabolism studied isolated brown adipocytes non-lactating lactating rats. Insulin stimulation total glucose metabolism 50% less brown adipocytes lactating non-lactating rats. reflects decreased effect insulin glucose oxidation lipogenesis. However, effect noradrenaline (8 microM) glucose metabolism preserved brown adipocytes lactating rats compared non-lactating rats. number insulin receptors similar BAT lactating non-lactating rats. insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase activity altered lactation, receptor autophosphorylation well tyrosine kinase activity towards synthetic peptide poly(Glu4-Tyr1). defect action insulin thus localized post-receptor level. insulin stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase activity euglycaemic/hyperinsulinaemic clamps 2-fold lower BAT lactating non-lactating rats. However, percentage active form pyruvate dehydrogenase similar non-lactating lactating rats (8.6% versus 8.9% basal state, 37.0% versus 32.3% clamp). decrease amount pyruvate dehydrogenase likely involved insulin resistance described BAT lactation.
