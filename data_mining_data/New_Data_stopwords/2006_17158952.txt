 Cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis ATP production due, part, respiration injury (the Warburg effect). ATP generation glycolysis less efficient mitochondrial respiration, cancer cells metabolic disadvantage survive competition cells eventually develop drug resistance long-standing paradox. report mitochondrial respiration defects lead activation Akt survival pathway novel mechanism mediated NADH. Respiration-deficient cells (rho(-)) harboring mitochondrial DNA deletion exhibit dependency glycolysis, increased NADH, activation Akt, leading drug resistance survival advantage hypoxia. Similarly, chemical inhibition mitochondrial respiration hypoxia also activates Akt. increase NADH caused respiratory deficiency inactivates PTEN redox modification mechanism, leading Akt activation. findings provide novel mechanistic insight Warburg effect explain metabolic alteration cancer cells may gain survival advantage withstand therapeutic agents.
