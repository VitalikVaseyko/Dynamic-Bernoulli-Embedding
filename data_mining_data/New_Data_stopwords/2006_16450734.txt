 Possible causes normocytic hyperregeneratory anemia beside incomplete treatment iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency folic acid deficiency notably hemolysis. exclusion causes hemolysis like immune hemolytic anemias, microangiopathic hemolytic anemias hemoglobinopathies, enzyme deficiency erythrocytes considered. far common form worldwide Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency. frequent variants disease hemolysis occurs stress, imposed example infection, "oxidative" drugs ingestion fava beans. serious clinical complication Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency rarely observed neonatal icterus. enzyme variants cause chronic hemolysis described chronic nonsperocytic hemolytic anemia. form chronic anemia also caused enzyme deficiencies, frequently Pyruvate kinase deficiency. deficiencies glycolytic enzymes even rarer. noted rare forms neurological rather hematological symptoms predominate clinical syndrome. suspicion, basis clinical symptoms and/or familial history, diagnosis enzyme deficiency achieved relatively easy measurement enzyme activity. Accurate diagnosis might helpful therapeutic decisions (e.g. splenectomy certain forms) essential genetic counseling, since certain deficiencies transmitted autosomal recessive disorders (e.g. pyruvate kinase deficiency), common form, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency linked X-chromosome.
