 Type 2 diabetes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated elevated hepatic glucose production fatty acid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis (DNL)). High carbohydrate diets also increase hepatic glucose production lipogenesis. carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP, encoded MLXIPL) transcription factor major role hepatic response excess dietary carbohydrate. target genes include pyruvate kinase (PKLR) enzymes lipogenesis, regarded key regulator conversion dietary carbohydrate lipid energy storage. alternative hypothesis ChREBP function maintain hepatic ATP homeostasis restraining elevation phosphate ester intermediates response elevated glucose. supported following evidence: (i) key stimulus ChREBP activation induction target genes elevation phosphate esters; (ii) target genes ChREBP include key negative regulators hexose phosphate ester pool (GCKR, G6PC, SLC37A4) triose phosphate pool (PKLR); (iii) ChREBP knock-down models elevated hepatic hexose phosphates triose phosphates compromised ATP phosphorylation potential; (iv) gene defects G6PC SLC37A4 common variants MLXIPL, GCKR PKLR man associated elevated hepatic uric acid production (a marker ATP depletion) raised plasma uric acid levels. proposed compromised hepatic phosphate homeostasis contributing factor elevated hepatic glucose production lipogenesis associate type 2 diabetes, NAFLD excess carbohydrate diet.
