 role elongation factor (EF)-2 phosphorylation regulation pancreatic beta-cell protein synthesis glucose investigated INS-1-derived cell line 832/13. Incubation cells media containing 1 mm glucose resulted progressive increase EF-2 phosphorylation maximal 1-2 h. Readdition 10 mm glucose promoted rapid dephosphorylation EF-2 complete 10 min maintained ensuing 2 h. Similar results obtained using primary rat islets Min-6 insulinoma cells. glucose effect 832/13 cells replicated addition pyruvate alpha-ketocaproate, 2-deoxyglucose, suggesting mitochondrial metabolism required. Accordingly, glucose-mediated dephosphorylation EF-2 completely blocked mitochondrial respiratory antagonists antimycin oligomycin. hyperglycemic effect mimicked incubation cells 100 nm insulin, 30 mm potassium chloride, 0.25 mm diazoxide, indicating insulin secretion and/or depolarization beta cells required. locus high glucose effect appeared protein phosphatase-2A, principal phosphatase acting EF-2. Protein phosphatase-2A activity stimulated glucose addition 832/13 cells, neither protein phosphatase-1 calmodulin kinase III (EF-2 kinase) activity affected conditions. slower rephosphorylation EF-2 transition high low glucose may involve effects EF-2 kinase activity. Addition 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-d-ribofuranoside high glucose led marked stimulation EF-2 phosphorylation, consistent possibility increased AMP kinase activity low glucose stimulates EF-2 kinase. parallel effects EF-2 dephosphorylation, addition high glucose 832/13 cells markedly increased incorporation [(35)S]methionine total protein. Taken together, results suggest modulation extracellular glucose impacts protein translation rate beta cells least part regulation elongation step, via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation EF-2.
