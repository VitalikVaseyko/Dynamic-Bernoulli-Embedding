 Hypocretin-1 (HC, orexin-A) neuropeptide involved regulating physiological functions sleep, appetite arousal, shown intranasal (IN) administration target HC brain. Recent clinical studies shown HC functional effects human clinical trials. study, use rats determine whether HC immediate effect food consumption locomotor activity, whether distribution brain delivery dose-dependent, whether MAPK PDK1 affected delivery. Food intake wheel-running activity quantified 24h delivery. Biodistribution determined 30min delivery high low dose 125I-radiolabelled HC throughout brain bodily tissues, Western blots used quantify changes cell signaling pathways (MAPK PDK1) brain. Intranasal HC significantly increased food intake wheel activity within 4h delivery, balanced course 24h. distribution studies showed dose-dependent delivery CNS peripheral tissues, PDK1 significantly increased brain 30min delivery HC. study adds growing body evidence administration HC promising strategy treatment HC related behaviors.
