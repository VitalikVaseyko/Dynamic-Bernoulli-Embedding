 Pancreatic cancer aggressive cancer poor prognosis limited treatment options. Cancer cells rapidly proliferate resistant cell death due, part, shift mitochondrial metabolism glycolysis. hypothesized shift important regulating cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i), ATP-dependent plasma membrane Ca(2+) ATPase (PMCA) critical maintaining low [Ca(2+)]i thus cell survival. present study aimed determine relative contribution mitochondrial versus glycolytic ATP fuelling PMCA human pancreatic cancer cells. report glycolytic inhibition induced profound ATP depletion, PMCA inhibition, [Ca(2+)]i overload, cell death PANC1 MIA PaCa-2 cells. Conversely, inhibition mitochondrial metabolism effect, suggesting glycolytic ATP critical [Ca(2+)]i homeostasis thus survival. Targeting glycolytic regulation PMCA may, therefore, effective strategy selectively killing pancreatic cancer sparing healthy cells.
