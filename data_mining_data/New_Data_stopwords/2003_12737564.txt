 Alternative substrates DNA RNA polymerases offer important set biochemical tools. Many standard methods nucleoside triphosphate synthesis fail cases nonpurine nonpyrimidine nucleosides. efficient preparation 5'-O-tosylates deoxy- ribonucleosides enabled preparation diphosphate esters displacement tris(tetra-n-butylammonium) pyrophosphate. Enzymatic synthesis azole carboxamide deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate based ATP phosphate donor, nucleoside diphosphate kinase catalyst, coupled phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) pyruvate kinase ATP regeneration system. Ribonucleoside triphosphate synthesis required PEP phosphate donor pyruvate kinase catalyst. optimized purification procedure based upon boronate affinity gel developed yield highly purified nucleoside triphosphates. strategy outlined provides new efficient method preparation nucleoside 5'-triphosphate likely applicable broad variety base sugar modified nucleoside analogues.
