 Resistance blood-stage malaria AcB55 AcB61 caused loss function mutation pyruvate kinase (Pklr(I90N)). Likewise, pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency humans protective Plasmodium replication vitro. identified third AcB strain, AcB62 also carries Pklr(I90N) mutation. However, AcB62 mice susceptible P.chabaudi infection showed high levels parasite replication (54-62% peak parasitemia). AcB62 mice showed hallmarks PK deficiency-associated anemia similar AcB55/61 reticulocytosis, splenic red pulp expansion, tissue iron overload, increased expression iron metabolism proteins. suggests malaria susceptibility AcB62 absence PK deficiency-associated pathophysiology. map novel genetic factors affecting malaria susceptibility AcB62, generated informative F2 population using AcB62 (Pklr(I90N)) CBA-Pk(slc) (Pklr(G338D)) progenitors identified novel locus chromosome 9 (Char10; LOD=7.24) controls peak parasitemia. weaker linkage Pklr region chromosome 3 (LOD=3.7) also detected, finding may reflect segregation two defective Pklr alleles. AcB62 alleles loci associated higher peak parasitemia. results identify Char10 novel locus modulating severity malaria context PK deficiency.
