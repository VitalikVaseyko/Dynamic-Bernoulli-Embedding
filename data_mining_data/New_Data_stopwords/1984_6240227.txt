 work presented herein describes many physiological properties phosphofructokinase regulatory factors. Factor activity separated two discrete fractions, designated factor factor B, based respective charges. preparation containing factor factor B protect following key carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes thermal inactivation: glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase (solubilized nonsolubilized forms), pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, muscle-type phosphofructokinase, minor liver phosphofructokinase isozyme. Factor activity sample found Pronase sensitive, irreversibly precipitated trichloroacetic acid, reversibly precipitated adjusting sample pH 3.0, stable heating 98 degrees C 20 min. Distribution studies indicated factor activity found soluble cell fraction mitochondrial nuclear fractions. Factor activity retained 12,000-14,000 molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) dialysis tubing, retained 50,000 MWCO dialysis tubing. studies indicate fructose-2,6-P2, calmodulin, insulin-generated mediator associated factor activity. Although fructose-2,6-P2 not, factor preparations protect major liver phosphofructokinase isozyme (liver PFK) inactivation lysosomal extracts. diabetic rat, activities factors greatly reduced return near normal levels 48 h insulin administration. data suggest factor B little effect kinetic properties liver PFK. However, factor K-type activator respect fructose-6-P, increasing Km Ki ATP, slightly increasing Vm.
