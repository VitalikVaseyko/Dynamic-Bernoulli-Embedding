 Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, E.C.2.7.1.40) purified 30,000-fold, using method includes ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-75 filtration, Blue Dextran-Sepharose 4B chromatography. enzyme resolved two peaks Blue Dextran-Sepharose 4B. first peak sp act 300 corresponds mature form (R4) whereas second peak sp act 180 corresponds R2R'2. Peaks II give one band 10% polyacrylamide gel without SDS. Peak II gives two bands 10% SDS gel molecular weights 60,000 (R') 57,500 (R). hand, peak gives one band 10% SDS gel molecular weight 57,500. R4 R2R'2 forms enzyme pH optimum 7.2.
