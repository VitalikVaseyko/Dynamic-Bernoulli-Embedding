 methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) become attractive target anti-malarial drug discovery. study describes kinetic model pathway, use validating 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) drug target systemic perspective, additional target identification, using metabolic control analysis silico inhibition studies. addition DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) targeted first enzyme pathway highest flux control coefficient followed DXR. silico inhibition enzymes caused large decrement pathway flux. added advantage targeting DXS influence vitamin B1 B6 biosynthesis. Two potential targets, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase, also identified. inhibition caused large accumulation substrates causing instability system. study demonstrates types enzyme targets, one acting via flux reduction metabolite accumulation, exist P. falciparum MEP pathway. groups targets exploited independent anti-malarial drugs.
