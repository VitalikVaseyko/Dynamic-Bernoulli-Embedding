 study, activation mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway analyzed proliferating rat hepatocytes vivo partial hepatectomy vitro following epidermal growth factor (EGF)-pyruvate stimulation. First, biphasic MEK/ERK activation evidenced G(1) phase hepatocytes regenerating liver sham-operated control animals. One occurred early G(1) (30 min 4 h), occurred mid-late G(1), peaking around 10.5 h. Interestingly, mid-late G(1) activation peak located cyclin D1 induction vivo vitro models. Second, biological role MEK/ERK cascade activation hepatocyte progression G(1)/S transition assessed adding MEK inhibitor (PD 98059) EGF-pyruvate-stimulated hepatocytes primary culture. presence MEK inhibitor, cyclin D1 mRNA accumulation inhibited, DNA replication totally abolished, MEK1 isoform preferentially targeted inhibition. effect dose dependent completely reversed removing MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, transient transfection hepatocytes activated MEK1 construct resulted increased cyclin D1 mRNA accumulation. Third, correlation mid-late G(1) MEK/ERK activation hepatocytes vivo partial hepatectomy mitogen-independent proliferation capacity cells vitro established. Among hepatocytes isolated either 5, 7, 9, 12 15 h partial hepatectomy, isolated 12- 15-h regenerating livers able replicate DNA without additional growth stimulation vitro. addition, PD 98059 intravenous administration vivo, MEK activation, able inhibit DNA replication hepatocytes regenerating livers. Taken together, results show (i) early induction MEK/ERK cascade restricted hepatocytes hepatectomized animals, allowing early distinction primed hepatocytes returning quiescence, (ii) mid-late G(1) MEK/ERK activation mainly associated cyclin D1 accumulation leads mitogen-independent progression hepatocytes phase. results allow us point growth factor dependency mid-late G(1) phase proliferating hepatocytes vivo observed vitro proliferating hepatocytes argue crucial role MEK/ERK cascade signalling pathway.
