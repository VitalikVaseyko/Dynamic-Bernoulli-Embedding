 Otto Warburg pioneered quantitative investigations cancer cell metabolism, well photosynthesis respiration. Warburg co-workers showed 1920s that, aerobic conditions, tumour tissues metabolize approximately tenfold glucose lactate given time normal tissues, phenomenon known Warburg effect. However, increase aerobic glycolysis cancer cells often erroneously thought occur instead mitochondrial respiration misinterpreted evidence damage respiration instead damage regulation glycolysis. fact, many cancers exhibit Warburg effect retaining mitochondrial respiration. re-examine Warburg's observations relation current concepts cancer metabolism intimately linked alterations mitochondrial DNA, oncogenes tumour suppressors, thus readily exploitable cancer therapy.
