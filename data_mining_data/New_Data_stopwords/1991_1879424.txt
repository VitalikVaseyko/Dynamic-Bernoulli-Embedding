 Trypanosoma brucei (stock 427) genes encoding glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase present two homologous chromosomes. cloned characterized one alleles. Two large, tandemly arranged open reading frames found, coding pyruvate kinase polypeptide 498 amino acids. gene sequences differ 15 positions, resulting five amino acid substitutions. calculated molecular masses polypeptides 54,378 Da 54,363 Da. values somewhat smaller reported subunit molecular mass purified protein, 57-59 kDa. However, vitro translation DNA region corresponding open reading frame, translation RNA wheat-germ lysate, yielded product comigrated exactly native polypeptide SDS/PAGE. overall identity sequences trypanosomal enzyme enzymes sources 41-51%. conserved residues equally distributed polypeptide. primary structure domains and, lesser extent, B, constitute active site, rather well conserved. contrast, sequence domain C, supposedly involved regulation enzyme activity, much variable. cytosolically located pyruvate kinase T. brucei lacks specific features found majority glycolytic enzymes organism sequestered microbody-like organelle, glycosome. neither relatively high subunit molecular mass, due unique insertions terminal extensions, high excess positively charged amino acids. polypeptide shorter pyruvate kinases calculated net charge +3.
