 RAS protein family members (KRAS4A, KRAS4B, HRAS NRAS) function GDP-GTP-regulated on-off switches, regulate cytoplasmic-nuclear signaling networks ruling diverse normal cellular processes. Constitutive activating mutations RAS genes found 30% human cancers, remarkably, oncogenic Ras mutations mutations components Ras/MAPK signaling pathways seem mutually exclusive tumors, pointing deregulation Ras-dependent signaling essential requirement tumorigenesis. 30% solid tumors known mutated (abnormal) KRAS gene. Unfortunately, patients harboring mutated KRAS CRC unlikely benefit anti-EGFR therapy. Moreover, remains unclear patients KRAS wild-type CRC definitely respond therapies. Although clinically designed-strategies modulate KRAS aberrant activation designed, attempts target KRAS failed clinical assays K-RAS assumed invulnerable chemotherapeutic attack. Recently, different encouraging publications reported ascorbate may selective antitumoral effect KRAS mutant cancer cells. review aim describe prevalence importance KRAS mutation cancer associated problems clinical handling patients harboring tumors. highlight role mutated KRAS boosting keeping tumor associated aberrant cell metabolism stating in-depth studies molecular mechanism ascorbate bypass mutated KRAS-related metabolic alterations may constitute new pathway design novel molecules order handle tumor resistance anti EGFR-therapies.
