 Glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis part decreasing rate phosphoenolpyruvate disposal pyruvate kinase. Glucagon, via cyclic AMP (cAMP) cAMP-dependent protein kinase, enhances phosphorylation pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Phosphorylation pyruvate kinase results enzyme inhibition decreased recycling phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate enhanced glucose synthesis. Although phosphorylation 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase catalyzed vitro cAMP-dependent protein kinase, role phosphorylation regulating activity flux enzymes intact cells uncertain. Glucagon regulation two enzyme activities brought primarily changes level novel sugar diphosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. compound activator phosphofructokinase inhibitor fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; also potentiates effect AMP enzymes. Glucagon addition isolated liver systems results greater 90% decrease level compound. effect explains large part effect glucagon enhance flux fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase suppress flux phosphofructokinase. discovery fructose 2,6-bisphosphate greatly furthered understanding regulation fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-bisphosphate substrate cycle.
