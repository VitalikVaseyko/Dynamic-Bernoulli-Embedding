 patients originally genotyped homoallelic Gaucher disease (GD) L444P (1448C) mutation, sought confirm previously reported phenotypic differences Caucasians Japanese, determine prevalence phenotypic impact recombinant alleles, explore phenotypic influence genetic background. therefore analyzed data longer-term clinical follow-up, comprehensive genotyping polymorphism mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing known Japanese L444P homozygotes (n=15). studies demonstrated that, 12 patients series originally diagnosed non-neuronopathic GD, 9 developed neurological signs/symptoms follow-up (at mean 14 years 11 months +/- 11 years 4 months). three patients originally diagnosed acute neuronopathic (type 2) GD, three compound heterozygotes L444P complex allele RecNci I. entire series, Pvu II liver erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PKLR) polymorphism prevalence 9 bp mtDNA deletion heterogeneous, background genetic factors could predict phenotypic expression. data suggest that, Japanese Caucasian patients, L444P/L444P genotype highly associated subacute neuronopathic (type 3) GD, presence complex allele together L444P allele leads type 2 disease. findings also underline importance comprehensive genotyping (particularly testing recombinant alleles), long-term follow-up careful neurological examination patients early-onset GD. measures ultimately may improve genotype/phenotype correlations and, them, genetic counseling therapeutic decision making.
