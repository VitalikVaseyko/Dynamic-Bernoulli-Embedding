 evaluated effect dietary starch level growth performance, feed utilization, whole-body composition activity selected key enzymes intermediary metabolism gilthead sea bream juveniles reared 18 25 degrees C. diet formulated contain 48% crude protein, 12% lipids 30% gelatinized maize starch (diet 30GS). Two diets formulated include level ingredients diet 30GS except gelatinized starch, included 20% (diet 20GS) 10% (diet 10GS). adjustment diet composition otherwise made. diet fed triplicate groups gilthead sea bream (30 g initial mass) 8 weeks, pair-feeding scheme. higher temperature improved growth performance opposite true feed efficiency protein efficiency ratio. Independently temperature, growth performance, feed efficiency protein efficiency ratio lower fish fed diet 30GS. effect temperature dietary starch level whole-body composition noticed. Hepatosomatic index liver glycogen higher 18 degrees C and, within temperature, fish fed diet 30GS. Glycemia affected temperature, lower fish fed diet 10GS. Data enzyme activities showed increasing water temperature enhances liver glucokinase (GK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activities, suggesting gilthead sea bream apt use dietary starch higher temperatures. effect temperature noticed hexokinase (HK), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activities. Dietary starch enhanced PK FBPase activities depressed GDH activity, suggesting lack significant regulation hepatic glucose utilization production species. HK, GK G6PD activities unaffected dietary composition. Irrespectively water temperature, gelatinized starch may included 20% diets gilthead sea bream juveniles; higher dietary levels, growth efficiency feed utilization depressed.
