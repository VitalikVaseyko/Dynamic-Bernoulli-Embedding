 1. L M1 isozymes pyruvate kinase purified homogeneity rat liver muscle respectively specific antibodies employed quantify isozyme concentration rat liver development. 2. Total enzyme activity decreases towards birth reaches minimum 3rd postnatal day, activity increases dramatically weaning. 3. Immunoprecipitation revealed M2 type predominates prenatal period decreases sharply birth. 4. L isozyme contribution augmented upon weaning sustained rat adult L/M ratio 9:1 maintained. 5. means incorporation studies [3H]leucine followed immunoprecipitation, increase L-type activity approaching term weaning explained twofold increase rate synthesis coupled concomitant reduction M2-type synthesis.
