 specificity cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase examined using two series dodecapeptides substrates. One series consisted peptides general sequence (Gly)x-Arg-Arg-(Gly)y-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly x + = 6. series consisted peptides sequence (Gly)x-Lys-Arg-(Gly)y-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly x + equal 6. peptides Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly also examined. series adjacent arginines located various distances serine, substrate enzyme clearly exhibited optimal kinetic constants contained one amino acid residue basic residues serine. Direct binding studies N alpha-[3H]acetyl peptides catalytic subunit cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase revealed correlation binding affinity ability serve substrate enzyme. second series adjacent basic amino acids Lys-Arg, optimal kinetic constants obtained residues separated serine single amino acid. latter result surprising view phosphorylation site sequences known physiologically significant protein substrates kinase, since containing Lys-Arg contain two amino acids residues serine.
