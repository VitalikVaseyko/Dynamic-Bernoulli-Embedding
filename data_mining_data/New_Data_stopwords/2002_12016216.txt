 high carbohydrate diet up-regulates transcription enzymes triglyceride biosynthesis (lipogenesis) mammalian liver. treatment stimulates hepatic insulin signaling, leading transcription sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). SREBP-1c implicated major factor up-regulates lipogenic genes response carbohydrate feeding. However, presented evidence another factor, carbohydrate response factor, also involved response, proposed model wherein SREBP-1c carbohydrate response factor independent transcription factors act response insulin glucose, respectively. study, examined contribution SREBP-1c expression lipogenic genes glucose- insulin-treated primary rat hepatocytes using inducible adenovirus system. found SREBP-1c overexpression leads modest induction fatty acid synthase, S(14), acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNAs 20% (fatty acid synthase), 10% (S(14)), 5% (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) induction seen high glucose insulin treatment. Restoring insulin cells overexpressing SREBP-1c increase mRNA levels. contrast, adenovirus-expressed SREBP-1c induce pyruvate kinase mRNA, suggesting induction gene SREBP-1c-independent. SREBP-1c indeed play role induction lipogenic enzyme genes response insulin treatment, sufficient induction seen hepatocytes treated insulin high glucose.
