 effect xanthone derivative 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-6-(1-H-tetrazole-5-yl)xanthen-9-one (BW A440C) red cells studied. added stored red cells concentration 6 mM, greatly improved preservation 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) observed. effect internal pH erythrocyte. concentration 0.500 mM, many red cell enzyme activities inhibited completely. 0.500 mM concentration, however, inhibition pyruvate kinase diphosphoglycerate phosphatase striking. Inhibition either enzymes could result elevation 2,3-DPG levels. BW A440C concentrations elevated 2,3-DPG levels humans caused decrease 2,3-DPG levels rabbits markedly impaired viability 21-day stored rabbit erythrocytes.
