 quantitative enzyme analysis 32 fetal human brains 6--42 weeks gestational age range carried major glycolytic pentose phosphate shunt enzymes. critical period raised enzyme levels observed 14 weeks. glycolytic rate probably controlled activities hexokinase phosphofructokinase appear development patterns independent genetic sites. rise enzyme activities experienced final weeks gestation towards levels consistent adult tissues. Pentose phosphate shunt enzyme levels remained virtually unchanged gestation 14 weeks.
