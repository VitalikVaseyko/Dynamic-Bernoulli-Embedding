 phosphatidyl-inosital-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway critical normal brain development function commonly hyperactivated brain cancer. PTEN (phosphatase tensin homolog deleted chromosome 10) tumor suppressor protein phosphate-depended kinase 1 (PDK-1) critical regulators pathway. July 15, 2009, issue Genes & Development, Chalhoub colleagues (pp. 1619-1624) demonstrate PDK1-dependent PDK1-independent effects conditional PTEN deletion brain, identify cell type-specific differences feedback regulation PI3K pathway. studies provide important insights neurons glia may differentially regulate PI3K signaling, yielding intriguing clues targeting PTEN-deficient brain cancers.
