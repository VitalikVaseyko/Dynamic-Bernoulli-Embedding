 erythrocyte metabolism two patients nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia caused hexokinase deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency, respectively, studied NMR. complexing ATP 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) Mg2+ hemoglobin (Hb) determined using 31P-NMR oxygenated deoxygenated cells investigate influences enzyme defects intracellular magnesium distribution Hb oxygen dissociation. pyruvate kinase-deficient red blood cells, 2,3-DPG concentration almost twice normal value ATP concentration near lower limit normal range. hexokinase-deficient red cell population, predominance young cells masked deficiency. Therefore, reticulocyte control cells included study. oxygenated pyruvate kinase-deficient cells, fraction ATP complexed magnesium well free Mg2+ concentration normal, despite abnormal concentration 2,3-DPG. deoxygenated cells free Mg2+ concentration lower normal cells. fraction Hb complexed 2,3-DPG higher normal oxygenated deoxygenated pyruvate kinase-deficient cells, accordance high p50 oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. hexokinase-deficient cells, two major abnormalities found: cells deoxygenated, concentration ATP 2,3-DPG fell. observed sample could, therefore, consequence hexokinase deficiency. Despite almost normal levels magnesium-binding metabolites, free Mg2+ concentration oxygenated deoxygenated cels much lower normal cells. could cell-age-related phenomenon, since lower free Mg2+ concentrations also found reticulocyte control cells.
