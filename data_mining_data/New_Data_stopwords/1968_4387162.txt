 Bacterial endotoxins mice reduced induction cortisone two hepatic enzymes, tryptophan oxygenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, prevented glyconeogenesis liver induced hormone, induced intact animals liver enzyme tyrosine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase, proportion ld(50). cortisone given least amount (100 mug), resulted near maximal induction tryptophan oxygenase; smaller amount endotoxin reduced significantly level enzyme required 5 mg hormone injected. smallest amount endotoxin prevented tryptophan oxygenase induction given intravenously adrenalectomized mice 25 mug cortisone administered. amount (0.01 mug) 1/40,000th ld(50). metabolic processes subject alteration endotoxin required least 100 400 times much. property endotoxin serve sensitive bioassay, although dose-response curve steep.
