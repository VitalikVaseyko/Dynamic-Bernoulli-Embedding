 catabolic pathways butyrate, acetate, succinate, ethanol formation Reiter strain Treponema phagedenis investigated. Enzyme activities demonstrated glucose catabolism pyruvate Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Butyrate formation acetyl-coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) generate ATP substrate level phosphorylation involves NAD+-dependent 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase NAD(P)+-independent butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase activities. Butyrate formed butyryl-CoA CoA transphorase reaction. Phosphate acetyltransferase acetate kinase activities convert acetyl-CoA acetate. NADP+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase participates ethanol formation; however, manner acetyl-CoA reduced acetaldehyde unclear. membrane-associated fumarate reductase found utilized reduced ferredoxin flavin nucleotides physiological electron donors. Additional electron carriers may also involved electron transfer fumarate reduction. Strains Treponema denticola, T. vincentii, T. minutum utilized fumarate without succinate formation, whereas strains T. phagedenis T. refringens formed succinate exogenously supplied fumarate.
