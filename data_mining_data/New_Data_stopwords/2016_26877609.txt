 Glucose metabolism gastric cancer cells differs normal epithelial cells. Upregulated aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) gastric cancer meeting demands cell proliferation associated genetic mutations, epigenetic modification proteomic alteration. Understanding mechanisms aerobic glycolysis may contribute knowledge gastric carcinogenesis. Metabolomic studies offer novel, convenient practical tools search new biomarkers early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, chemosensitivity prediction gastric cancer. Interfering process glycolysis cancer cells may provide new promising therapeutic strategy gastric cancer. article, present brief review recent studies glucose metabolism gastric cancer, primary focus clinical applications new biomarkers potential therapeutic role gastric cancer.
