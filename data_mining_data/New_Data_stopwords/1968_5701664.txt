 1. effects temperature catalytic regulatory properties pyruvate kinases temperate-zone rainbow trout Antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii examined. 2. K(m) value pyruvate kinase one two substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate, temperature-dependent, lowest temperatures closely coincide habitat temperatures two fishes. 3. Two regulatory functions pyruvate kinase, feedforward activation fructose diphosphate feedback inhibition ATP, temperature-independent. Enzyme-ADP interaction also temperature-independent. 4. concluded enzyme-substrate enzyme-modulator interactions important factors short-term evolutionary adaptations poikilotherms changes temperature. Though K(m) substrate may vary apparently adaptive manners, regulatory functions enzyme appear unchanged range temperatures experienced organism Nature.
