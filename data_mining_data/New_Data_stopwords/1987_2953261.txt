 Concentrations high-energy phosphates activities key enzymes energy metabolism assessed hearts species differing levels cardiac power output. Positive correlations found resting power output total adenylate pool citrate synthase activity total adenylate pool. Maximum vitro activity levels enzymes energy metabolism compared calculated resting cardiac power output maximal cardiac power output (as reflected total oligomycin-insensitive adenosine-triphosphatase activity). Three indexes carbohydrate metabolism (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, L-lactate dehydrogenase) plateau relatively low levels energy demand. contrast, enzymes required aerobic fatty acid metabolism, (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) tricarboxylic acid electron transport (citrate synthase cytochrome-c oxidase) show consistent increases ATP demand elevated. appears capacity power development vertebrate hearts, increases across taxa, elevated demand ATP met expansion fatty acid based aerobic metabolism carbohydrate metabolism.
