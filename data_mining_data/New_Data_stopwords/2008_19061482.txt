 Tamoxifen one prescribed anti-breast-cancer drugs, tumours becoming resistant hinder efficacy clinic. therefore great interest developing strategies reduce resistance sensitize breast cancer cells tamoxifen. groundbreaking study Iorns et al. published issue Biochemical Journal suggests signal transduction pathway controlled PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) plays crucial role regulating sensitivity breast cancer cells tamoxifen. implications study PDK1 PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), Akt (also known protein kinase B), S6K (S6 kinase) mTOR (mammalian target rapamycin) inhibitors, already developed cancer therapy, likely additional utility sensitizing breast tumours tamoxifen. commentary also discuss possibility inhibiting PDK1 pathway may help overcome acquired resistance anti-cancer treatments.
