 microbial array chip collagen gel spots entrapping living bacterial cells applied investigate metabolic regulation Paracoccus denitrificans. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) used monitor ferrocyanide production reflects electron flow respiratory chain located within internal membrane P. denitrificans. ferrocyanide production P. denitrificans largely depends types carbon source (glucose lactate), suggesting electron flow rate respiratory chain depends activity metabolic pathway located up-stream respiratory chain. importantly, found enzymes affecting glucose catabolic reactions significantly up-regulated cultures nutrient agar medium containing D-(+)-glucose sole carbon source. Enzyme assays using crude extracts P. denitrificans carried identify enzymes expressed higher level cultures supplemented D-(+)-glucose. confirmed pyruvate kinase enzymes overall Entner-Doudoroff pathway highly induced cultures containing D-(+)-glucose.
