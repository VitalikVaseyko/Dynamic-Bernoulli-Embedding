 new faculty member Johns Hopkins University, School Medicine, author began research cancer 1969 frequently fatal disease touched many knew. intrigued viscous nature, failure studied find cure, also fascinated pioneering work Otto Warburg, biochemical legend Nobel laureate. Warburg died 1 year later 1970 shown 1920s striking biochemical phenotype cancers aberrant energy metabolism. Unlike normal tissues derive energy (ATP) metabolizing sugar glucose carbon dioxide water, process involves oxygen-dependent organelles called "mitochondria", Warburg showed cancers frequently rely less mitochondria obtain much 50% ATP metabolizing glucose directly lactic acid, even presence oxygen. frequent phenotype cancers became known "Warburg effect", author review strongly believed understanding would facilitate discovery cure. Following final footsteps Warburg caught midst unpleasant anti-Warburg, anti-metabolic era, author students/collaborators began quietly identify key molecular events involved "Warburg effect". Here, author describes via series sequential discoveries touching five decades despite impairment respiratory capacity malignant tumors, hexokinase 2 (HK-2), mitochondrial receptor (VDAC), gene encodes HK-2 (HK-2 gene) play pivotal direct roles "Warburg effect". discovered also like "Trojan horse" simple lactic acid analog 3-bromopyruvate selectively enters cells cancerous animal tumors exhibit "Warburg effect" quickly dissipates energy (ATP) production factories (i.e., glycolysis mitochondria) resulting tumor destruction without harm animals.
