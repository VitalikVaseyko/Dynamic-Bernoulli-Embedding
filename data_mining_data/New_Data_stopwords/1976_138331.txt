 characteristics glycolytic pathway plasma membrane Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium studied. enzyme system glycolysis (hexokinase, glucokinase pyruvate kinase) main source energy anaerobic condition localized cell soluble fraction (cytoplasma) species examined. Neither electron transfer chain components oxidase activities found anaerobically cultured Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium. Adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities mainly localized plasma membrane, suggesting membrane ATPase playing key role membrane transport ATP synthesis anaerobic bacilla. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis membranes showed remarkable differences polypeptides patterns B. adolescentis B. bifidum. peculiarities polypeptide patterns among genus may useful identification species.
