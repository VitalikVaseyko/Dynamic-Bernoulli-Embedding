 Partly purified guinea-pig brain pyruvate kinase activated fructose 1,6-diphosphate gives hyperbolic substrate-saturation curves phosphoenolpyruvate. therefore different L-type pyruvate kinase mammalian liver. Inhibition MgATP(2-) competitive MgADP(-) phosphoenolpyruvate, enzyme therefore different M-type pyruvate kinase, said competitively inhibited MgATP(2-) respect substrates. K(i)(MgATP(2-)) value approx. 8mm brain enzyme higher values (about 2mm) reported muscle enzyme. Stimulation enzymic activity observed low (1-2mm) concentrations MgATP(2-). Substrate kinetic constants K(m) (MgADP(-))=0.47mm, K(m) (phosphoenolpyruvate)=0.08mm. Free Mg(2+) high concentrations (over 10mm) inhibitory (K(i)=20-32mm). Neither ADP(3-) 5'-AMP(2-) inhibited activity. brain enzyme concluded different M-type L-type mammalian organs muscle liver.
