 SIGNIFICANCE: last years, metabolic reprogramming, fluctuations bioenergetic fuels, modulation oxidative stress became new key hallmarks tumor development. cancer, elevated glucose uptake high glycolytic rate, source adenosine triphosphate, constitute growth advantage tumors. represents universally known Warburg effect, gave rise one major clinical application detecting cancer cells using glucose analogs: positron emission tomography scan imaging. Recent Advances: Glucose utilization carbon sources tumors much heterogeneous initially thought. Indeed, new studies emerged revealed dual capacity tumor cells glycolytic oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism. OXPHOS metabolism, relies predominantly mitochondrial respiration, exhibits fine-tuned regulation respiratory chain complexes enhanced antioxidant response detoxification capacity. CRITICAL ISSUES: OXPHOS-dependent cancer cells use alternative oxidizable substrates, glutamine fatty acids. diversity carbon substrates fueling neoplastic cells indicative metabolic heterogeneity, even within tumors sharing clinical diagnosis. Metabolic switch supports cancer cell stemness bioenergy-consuming functions, proliferation, survival, migration, invasion. Moreover, reactive oxygen species-induced mitochondrial metabolism nutrient availability important interaction tumor microenvironment components. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts immune cells participate metabolic interplay neoplastic cells. collectively adapt dynamic manner metabolic needs cancer cells, thus participating tumorigenesis resistance treatments. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Characterizing reciprocal metabolic interplay stromal, immune, neoplastic cells provide better understanding treatment resistance. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 26, 462-485.
