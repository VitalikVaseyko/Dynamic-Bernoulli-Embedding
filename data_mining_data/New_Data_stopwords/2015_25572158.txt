 study aimed investigate influence sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) associated resveratrol enzymatic activities acetylcholinesterase (AChE), adenylate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK), creatine kinase (CK) brain mice experimentally infected Toxoplasma gondii. that, 60 mice divided ten groups 6 animals each: groups composed healthy mice groups E J consisting animals infected T. gondii (VEG strain). Animals started treatment 20 days post-infection 10 consecutive days oral doses 0.5 mg kg(-1) ST (groups B F), 100 mg kg(-1) free resveratrol (groups C G) inclusion complex resveratrol (nanoparticles containing resveratrol) (groups H), well association drugs (groups J). results showed increased (P < 0.001) AChE activity infected animals (groups E-J) compared not-infected (A) animals, also uninfected animals treated ST (group B) increased AChE activity. AK activity decreased (P < 0.001) infected untreated (group E), differently groups differ. PK activity differ groups (P > 0.05). comparing control groups (uninfected (A) infected (E)), verified significant (P < 0.001) increase CK activity brain, noteworthy animals treated resveratrol associated ST (group J) similar CK activity animals group A. Treatment combination ST resveratrol able reduce (P < 0.05) number parasitic cysts brain, thus reduced inflammatory infiltrates liver, prevented occurrence hepatocytes lesions due toxoplasmosis mice. Based results, possible conclude increased AChE CK activities T. gondii infection change treatment ST-resveratrol association. addition, decreased AK activity caused T. gondii infection normalized ST-resveratrol treatment. T. gondii infection treatment affect PK activity brain.
