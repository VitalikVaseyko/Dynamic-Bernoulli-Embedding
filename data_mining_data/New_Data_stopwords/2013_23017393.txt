 present study investigates susceptibility individual myofibrillar proteins mackerel (Scomber scombrus) mince undergo carbonylation reactions chilled storage, antioxidant capacity (+)-catechin prevent oxidative processes proteins. carbonylation particular protein quantified combining labelling protein carbonyls fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide (FTSC) 1-D 2-D gel electrophoresis. Alpha skeletal actin, glycogen phosphorylase, unnamed protein product (UNP) similar enolase, pyruvate kinase, isoforms creatine kinase, aldolase isoform glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) showed elevated oxidation chilled non-supplemented mince. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) carbonylated chilled muscle, extensive MHC degradation observed samples. supplementation catechin reduced protein oxidation lipid oxidation concentration-dependent manner: control>25>100 approximately 200ppm. Therefore, highest catechin concentrations (100 200ppm) exhibited strongest antioxidant activity. Catechin (200ppm) reduced significantly carbonylation protein spots identified glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme, isoforms creatine kinase. Conversely, catechin ineffective inhibit oxidation actin UNP similar enolase. results draw attention inefficiency catechin prevent actin oxidation, contrast extremely high efficiency catechin inhibiting oxidation lipids proteins.
