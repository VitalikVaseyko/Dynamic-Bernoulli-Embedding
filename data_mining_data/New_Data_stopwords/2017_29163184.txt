 order survive conditions low oxygen, cancer cells undergo metabolic switch glycolysis suppress mitochondrial respiration order reduce oxygen consumption prevent excessive amounts reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Nucleus accumbens-1 (NAC1), nuclear protein BTB/POZ gene family, pivotal roles cancer development. Here, identified NAC1-PDK3 axis necessary suppression mitochondrial function, oxygen consumption, harmful ROS generation protects cancer cells apoptosis hypoxia. show NAC1 mediates suppression mitochondrial function hypoxia inducing expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) HIF-1alpha transcriptional level, thereby inactivating pyruvate dehydrogenase attenuating mitochondrial respiration. Re-expression PDK3 NAC1 absent cells rescued cells hypoxia-induced metabolic stress restored activity glycolysis xenograft mouse model, demonstrated silencing NAC1 expression enhance antitumor efficacy elesclomol, pro-oxidative agent. findings reveal novel mechanism NAC1 facilitates oxidative stress resistance cancer progression, chemo-resistance cancer therapy.
