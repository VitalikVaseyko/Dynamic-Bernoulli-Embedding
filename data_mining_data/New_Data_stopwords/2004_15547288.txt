 mutation recovered slr0721 gene, encodes decarboxylating NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, yielding mutant 3WEZ. continuous light, 3WEZ exhibits poor photoautotrophic growth growing photoheterotrophically glucose rates nearly indistinguishable wild-type rates. Interestingly, diurnal light conditions (12 h light 12 h dark), normal photoautotrophic growth mutant completely restored.
