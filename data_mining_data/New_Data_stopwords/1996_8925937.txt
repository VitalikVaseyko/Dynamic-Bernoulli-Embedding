 mechanism regulatory phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase component (E1) muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex studied. Chemical modification arginine residues essential substrate binding shown prevent incorporation 32P [gamma-32P]ATP E1 catalyzed kinase exclude completely interaction holo-E1 pyruvate. proposed negatively charged phosphoseryl residues may compete pyruvate active site arginine thereby block substrate binding.
