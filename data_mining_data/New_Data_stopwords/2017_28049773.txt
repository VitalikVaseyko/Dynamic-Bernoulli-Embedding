 Alternative splicing human glucuronosyltransferase 1 gene locus (UGT1) produces alternate isoforms UGT1A_i2s control glucuronidation activity protein-protein interactions. Here, hypothesized UGT1A_i2s function complex protein network connecting metabolic pathways influence cancer cell metabolism. based pathway enrichment analysis proteomic data identified several high-confidence candidate interaction proteins UGT1A_i2 proteins human tissues-namely, rate-limiting enzyme glycolysis pyruvate kinase (PKM), plays critical role cancer cell metabolism tumor growth. partnership UGT1A_i2 PKM2 confirmed coimmunoprecipitation HT115 colon cancer cells supported partial colocalization two proteins. support functional role partnership, depletion UGT1A_i2 proteins HT115 cells enforced Warburg effect, higher glycolytic rate expense mitochondrial respiration, led lactate accumulation. Untargeted metabolomics revealed significantly altered cellular content 58 metabolites, including many intermediates derived glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways. metabolic changes associated greater migration potential. potential relevance observations supported down-regulation UGT1A_i2 mRNA colon tumors compared normal tissues. Alternate UGT1A variants may thus part expanding compendium metabolic pathways involved cancer biology directly contributing oncogenic phenotype colon cancer cells. Findings uncover new aspects UGT functions diverging transferase activity.
