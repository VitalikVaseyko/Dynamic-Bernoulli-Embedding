 salivarian trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei infects mammals transmitted tsetse flies. mammalian 'bloodstream form' trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein coat relies glycolysis procyclic form tsetse flies EP protein surface developed mitochondrion. show mRNA procyclic-specific cytosolic phosphoglycerate kinase PGKB, like EP proteins, contains regulatory AU-rich element (ARE) destabilises mRNA bloodstream forms. human HuR protein binds to, stabilises, mammalian mRNAs containing AREs. Expression HuR bloodstream-form trypanosomes resulted growth arrest stabilisation EP, PGKB pyruvate, phosphate dikinase mRNAs, three bloodstream-specific mRNAs reduced abundance. synthesis abundance unregulated mRNAs proteins unaffected. results suggest regulation mRNA stability AREs arose early eukaryotic evolution.
