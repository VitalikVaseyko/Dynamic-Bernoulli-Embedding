 UNLABELLED: : Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) enormous potential source cell replacement therapies, tissue engineering, vitro toxicology applications. lack standardized robust bioprocesses hESC expansion hindered application hESCs derivatives clinical settings. developed robust well-characterized bioprocess hESC expansion fully defined conditions explored potential transcriptomic metabolomic tools comprehensive assessment culture system impact cell proliferation, metabolism, phenotype. Two different hESC lines (feeder-dependent feeder-free lines) efficiently expanded xeno-free microcarriers stirred culture systems. hESC lines maintained expression stemness markers Oct-4, Nanog, SSEA-4, TRA1-60 ability spontaneously differentiate three germ layers. Whole-genome transcriptome profiling revealed phenotypic convergence hESC lines along expansion process stirred-tank bioreactor cultures, providing strong evidence robustness cultivation process homogenize cellular phenotype. low-oxygen tension, results showed metabolic rearrangement upregulation glycolytic machinery favoring anaerobic glycolysis Warburg-effect-like phenotype, evidence hypoxic stress response, contrast two-dimensional culture. Overall, report standardized expansion bioprocess guarantee maximal product quality. Furthermore, "omics" tools used provided relevant findings physiological metabolic changes hESC expansion environmentally controlled stirred-tank bioreactors, contribute improved scale-up production systems. SIGNIFICANCE: clinical application human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hindered lack robust protocols able sustain production high cell numbers, required regenerative medicine. study, strategy developed expansion human embryonic stem cells well-defined culture conditions using microcarrier technology stirred-tank bioreactors. use transcriptomic metabolic tools allowed detailed characterization cell-based product showed phenotypic convergence hESC lines along expansion process. study provided valuable insights metabolic hallmarks hPSC expansion new information guide bioprocess design media optimization production cells higher quantity improved quality, requisite translation clinic.
