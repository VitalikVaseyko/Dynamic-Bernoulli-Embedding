 absence introns prokaryotic genes explained intron loss various bases. report another piece evidence intron loss, found thermal stability map DNA. calculated local melting temperature cDNA sequences found (i) gaps thermal stability tend occur near intron positions statistical significance, (ii) one-third gaps far intron positions assigned lost introns. results conclude gaps thermal stability protein coding regions vestiges lost introns.
