 Yellowing detached mature tobacco leaves standing water dark accompanied strong "climacteric rise" respiration rate. period ATP level energy charge adenylate system also rose. levels glycolytic intermediates glucose 1-phosphate triose phosphates rose, 3-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate fell, pyruvate rose. assumption drop NAD/NADH ratio, found workers wheat leaves, reverse crossover triose phosphates 3-phospholglycerate attributed inhibition glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. forward crossover phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate taken indicate activation pyruvate kinase, possibly fructose diphosphate. Secondary large rises pyruvate fructose diphosphate occurred well climacteric peak passed. evidence found participation phosphofructokinase metabolic control yellowing leaf. Possible limitations use crossover theorem present situation, changes compartmentation flux branch points, emphasized.
