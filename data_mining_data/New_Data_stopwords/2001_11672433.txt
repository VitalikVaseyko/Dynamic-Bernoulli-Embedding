 enzyme fructose-6-phosphate 2-kinase (F6P,2K; 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F26BPase) catalyses formation degradation regulatory metabolite fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. cDNA encoding bifunctional plant enzyme isolated Arabidopsis thaliana (AtF2KP) expressed yeast, substrate affinities allosteric properties affinity-purified enzyme characterized. addition known regulators 3-phosphoglycerate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate P(i), several metabolites identified important new effectors. PP(i), phosphoenolpyruvate 2-phosphoglycerate strongly inhibited F6P,2K activity, whereas fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 6-phosphogluconate inhibited F26BPase activity. Furthermore, pyruvate activator F6P,2K inhibitor F26BPase. kinase phosphatase activities rapidly inactivated mild heat treatment (42 degrees C, 10 min), presence phosphate protected enzyme activities inactivation. addition catalytic regions, Arabidopsis enzyme comprises 345-amino-acid N-terminus unknown function. role region examined expression series N-terminally truncated enzymes. full-length truncated enzymes analysed gel-filtration chromatography. full-length enzyme eluted homotetramer, whereas truncated enzymes eluted monomers. Deletion N-terminus decreased kinase/phosphatase activity ratio 4-fold, decreased affinity substrate fructose 6-phosphate. data show N-terminus important subunit assembly defining kinetic properties enzyme.
