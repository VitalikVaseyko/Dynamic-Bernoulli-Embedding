 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells utilise glycolytic pathway even adequate oxygen present, phenomenon known Warburg effect. examined whether system operative multiple myeloma (MM) cells whether glycolysis inhibition potential therapeutic modality. METHODS: MM cells purified 59 patients using CD138-immunomagnetic beads. expression levels genes associated glycolysis, c-MYC, GLUT1, LDHA, HIF1A pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) determined real-time PCR. Glucose consumption lactate production MM cell lines analysed. Oxamate, LDH inhibitor, dichloroacetate (DCA), PDK1 inhibitor, employed. Inhibition PDK1 expression achieved using siRNA. RESULTS: High LDHA expression found indicator poor prognosis. also positively correlated expression PDK1, c-MYC GLUT1. Greater glucose consumption lactate production MM cells associated higher LDHA expression. glycolysis inhibitors (oxamate, DCA PDK1 siRNA) induced apoptosis MM cells. DCA combined bortezomib showed additive cytotoxic effects. CONCLUSION: present data suggest Warburg effect operative MM cells. PDK1 overexpressed normal tissues, PDK1 inhibition could serve novel therapeutic approach.
