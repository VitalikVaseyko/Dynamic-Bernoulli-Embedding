 believed enzyme catalysis facilitated conformational dynamics protein scaffold surrounds active site, yet exact nature catalytically relevant protein motions remains largely unknown. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) reports backbone H-bond fluctuations. HDX/MS thus represents promising avenue probing relationship enzyme dynamics catalysis. seemingly straightforward strategy studies involves comparative measurements substrate turnover resting state. examined feasibility approach using rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (rM1-PK) catalyzes conversion phosphoenolpyruvate Mg-ADP pyruvate Mg-ATP. HDX/MS revealed catalytically active rM1-PK undergoes significant rigidification active site. finding counterintuitive, considering purported correlation dynamics catalysis. Interestingly, virtually rigidification seen upon exposing rM1-PK substrates products absence turnover. data imply active site dynamics turnover dominated protein-ligand binding interactions. interactions stabilize H-bonds vicinity active site, thereby masking subtle dynamic features might uniquely associated catalysis. data uncover inherent problem side-by-side turnover/resting state measurements, i.e., difficulty design suitable reference state working enzyme compared. Comparative HDX/MS experiments enzyme dynamics therefore interpreted caution.
