 mechanism whereby glucagon causes increase concentration cytoplasmic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]c, isolated hepatocytes investigated. proposals cyclic-AMP-dependent cyclic-AMP-independent mechanisms. work, inactivation pyruvate kinase used indicator increases activity cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase, A-kinase. [Ca2+]c measured using fluorescent probe indo-1. decrease activity pyruvate kinase caused increase [Ca2+]c alone, i.e. mediated mechanisms involving cyclic AMP exemplified effect vasopressin, minimal significance conditions enzyme assay. Studies effects wide range glucagon concentrations indicate increase [Ca2+]c caused glucagon always associated decrease pyruvate kinase activity. similar relationship obtained glucagon-receptor occupancy circumvented using 8-bromo-derivative cyclic AMP activate A-kinase. also found cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine could potentiate ability glucagon increase [Ca2+]c: potentiation observed vasopressin used raise [Ca2+]c. Together data indicate increase cyclic AMP concentration, sufficiently great activate A-kinase, mechanism mediates glucagon-induced increase [Ca2+]c.
