 Resveratrol (RES), polyphenol found natural foods, displays anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory anti-proliferative properties potentially beneficial cancers, particular prevention tumor growth. However, rapid metabolism resveratrol strongly limits bioavailability. molecular mechanisms sustaining potential biological activity low doses resveratrol extensively studied and, thus, needs better characterization. Here, show resveratrol (10 microM, 48 hr) induces cell growth arrest metabolic reprogramming colon cancer cells. Resveratrol modifies lipidomic profile, increases oxidative capacities decreases glycolysis, association decreased pentose phosphate activity increased ATP production. Resveratrol targets pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, key mitochondrial gatekeeper energy metabolism, leading enhanced PDH activity. Calcium chelation, well blockade mitochondrial calcium uniport, prevents resveratrol-induced augmentation oxidative capacities increased PDH activity suggesting calcium might play role metabolic shift. demonstrate inhibition CamKKB downstream AMPK pathway partly abolished resveratrol-induced increase glucose oxidation. suggests resveratrol might improve oxidative capacities cancer cells CamKKB/AMPK pathway.
