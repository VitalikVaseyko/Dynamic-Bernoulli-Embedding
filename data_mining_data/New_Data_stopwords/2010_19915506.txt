 PURPOSE: debate whether interval traditional endurance training effective stimulus mitochondrial biogenesis. Here, compared effects acute interval exercise (IE) continuous exercise (CE) muscle messenger RNA (mRNA) content several genes involved mitochondrial biogenesis lipid metabolism. METHODS: Nine sedentary subjects cycled 90 min two protocols: CE (at 67% VO2max) IE (12 120% 18 20% VO2max). duration exercise work performed CE IE identical. Muscle biopsies taken 3 h exercise. RESULTS: significant differences two exercise protocols increases VO2 HR, reduction muscle glycogen (35%-40% protocols) changes blood metabolites (lactate, glucose, fatty acids). mRNA content major regulators mitochondrial biogenesis [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), PGC-1-related coactivator, PPARbeta/delta] lipid metabolism [pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4)] increased exercise, significant difference IE CE. However, mRNA content several downstream targets PGC-1alpha increased significantly CE, mRNA content nuclear respiratory factor 2 significantly higher CE (P < 0.025 vs IE). CONCLUSIONS: present findings demonstrate that, duration exercise work performed same, IE CE influence transcription genes involved oxidative metabolism similar manner.
