 Impairment red cell deformability (and decrease survival time) common trait congenital haemolytic anemias exception enzyme defect glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GPDH) deficiency. Causes increased red cell rigidity may be: spherocytosis (familial hemolytic anemia), instable less fluid Hb (instable hemoglobinopathy), abnormal HbS-formation (sickle cell disease), genetic synthesis defect Hb chains (homozygous beta-thalassemia), enzyme defects (autosomal recessive pyruvate-kinase deficiency). GPDH red cell deformability remains unchanged. Splenectomy may beneficial anemias erythrocyte rigidification clinical condition requires (repeated transfusions, aplastic hemolytic crises). Assessment red cell deformability vitro saves laborous exposure radiation involving testing cell survival time (e.g. radiochrome test).
