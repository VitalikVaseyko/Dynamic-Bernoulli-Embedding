 Congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemias heterogeneous group disorders caused ineffective normal-type enzyme or, commonly, structurally abnormal ineffective mutant enzyme. first part paper deals laboratory diagnosis diseases, based three-step approach: demonstration haemolytic nature disease, demonstration cause haemolysis intracorpuscular demonstration presence absolute relative enzyme deficiency. Moreover, possible causes false negative results standard enzyme assays briefly commented. second part focuses main clinical, laboratory biochemical features common enzyme deficiencies Embden-Meyerhof pathway purine pyrimidine metabolism, particular mention cases identified Italy.
