 Members Msi family RNA-binding proteins recently emerged potent oncoproteins range malignancies. MSI2 highly expressed hematopoietic cancers, required disease maintenance. contrast hematopoietic system, colorectal cancers express Msi family members, MSI1 MSI2. Here, demonstrate that, intestinal epithelium, Msi1 Msi2 analogous oncogenic effects. Further, comparison Msi1/2-induced gene expression programs transcriptome-wide analyses Msi1/2-RNA-binding targets reveal significant functional overlap, including induction PDK-Akt-mTORC1 axis. Ultimately, demonstrate concomitant loss function MSI family members sufficient abrogate growth human colorectal cancer cells, Msi gene deletion inhibits tumorigenesis several mouse models intestinal cancer. findings demonstrate MSI1 MSI2 act functionally redundant oncoproteins required ontogeny intestinal cancers.
