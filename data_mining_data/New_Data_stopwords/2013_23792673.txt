 Disruption creatine kinase (CK) system hearts CK-deficient mice leads changes ultrastructure regulation mitochondrial respiration. expected see similar changes creatine-deficient mice, lack enzyme guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) produce creatine. aim study characterize changes cardiomyocyte mitochondrial organization, regulation respiration, intracellular compartmentation associated GAMT deficiency. Three-dimensional mitochondrial organization assessed confocal microscopy. populations permeabilized cardiomyocytes, recorded ADP ATP kinetics respiration, competition mitochondria pyruvate kinase ADP produced ATPases, ADP kinetics endogenous pyruvate kinase, ATP kinetics ATPases. data analyzed mathematical models estimate intracellular compartmentation. Quantitative analysis morphological kinetic data well derived model fits showed difference GAMT-deficient wild-type mice. conclude inactivation CK system GAMT deficiency alter mitochondrial organization intracellular compartmentation relaxed cardiomyocytes. Thus, results suggest healthy heart able preserve cardiac function basal level absence CK-facilitated energy transfer without compromising intracellular organization regulation mitochondrial energy homeostasis. raises questions importance CK system spatial energy buffer unstressed cardiomyocytes.
