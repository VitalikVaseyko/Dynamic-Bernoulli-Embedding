 Hepatocytes prepared rats various perinatal stages cultured selective medium allow fibroblastic cell growth. Cell population remained homogeneous culture. Hepatocytes undergo divisions period, varies according stage development rat. Light electron microscope observations showed presence numerous cytoplasmic organelles; moreover, hydrocortisone-induced structures similar bile canaliculi. Chromatin protein kinase decreased rapidly culture except samples prepared 17-day fetuses remained unchanged 2 days decreased lesser extent afterwards. Chromatin nonhistone proteins incubated (gamma-32P) ATP phosphorylation pattern analyzed polyacrylamide gels. Many radioactive peaks observed chromatin proteins 17-day fetuses; much lower proteins 19-day fetuses. phosphorylation pattern analyzed hepatocytes 2 days culture. Many radioactive peaks observed proteins hepatocytes taken 17-day fetuses; radioactivity observed proteins 19-day fetuses. contrast absence radioactive peaks chromatin proteins adult rat hepatocytes. cytoplasm, aldolase pyruvate kinase specific activities varied according age rat. strongly decreased culture except hepatocytes 15- 17-day fetuses, remained stable least 5 days. stability chromatin cytoplasmic enzymes hepatocytes 17-day fetuses could result ability regulated hormones secreted stage development.
