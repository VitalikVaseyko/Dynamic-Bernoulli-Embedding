 epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) "hypertrophied" obese. Thiazolidinediones anti-diabetic, hypolipidemic drugs selective agonists gamma isoform peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma). evaluated short-term effects prototype rosiglitazone (RSG, 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) 4 days) expression genes proteins (by real-time PCR Western blot) involved fatty acid (FA) metabolism EAT obese fatty Zucker rat compared levels expression retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RAT). glyceroneogenic flux leading fatty acid re-esterification assessed incorporation 14C [1-14C]-pyruvate neutral lipids. RSG upregulated mRNA phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, glycerol kinase, adipocyte lipid binding protein, adipose tissue triglyceride lipase lipoprotein lipase RAT EAT resulting increase glyceroneogenesis that, however, pronounced EAT RAT. RSG, fatty acid output decreased tissues unexpectedly less EAT RAT. RSG also induced expression key genes fatty acid oxidation [carnitinepalmitoyl transferase-1, medium chain acyl dehydrogenase long chain acyl dehydrogenase (VLCAD)]in EAT RAT resulting significant rise expression VLCAD protein. addition, expression genes encoding proteins involved mitochondrial processing density PPARgamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha), NADH dehydrogenase 1 cytochrome oxidase (COX4) increased RSG treatment EAT, resulting significant up-regulation PGC1-alpha COX4 protein. accompanied rise expression PR domain containing 16 uncoupling protein 1, two brown adipose tissue-specific proteins. conclusion, study reveals PPAR-gamma agonist could induce rapid browning EAT probably contributes increase lipid turnover.
