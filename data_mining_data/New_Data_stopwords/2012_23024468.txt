 study mechanism action water soluble compound GII purified fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum) seeds shown earlier antidiabetic effect subdiabetic, moderately severely diabetic rabbits. rabbits (1-1.5 kg bw) diabetes induced intravenous injection 80 mg/kg bw alloxan. fed GII dose 50 mg/kg bw daily morning 15 days subdiabetic moderately diabetic 30 days severely diabetic rabbits. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), LDL + VLDL cholesterol [(LDL + VLDL)C], HDL cholesterol [(HDL)C], total tissue lipids, glycogen enzymes carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, polyol pathway) hexokinase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldose reductase sorbitol dehydrogenase antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase superoxide dismutase estimated. Liver kidney function parameters also estimated. Treatment GII 15 days subdiabetic moderately diabetic rabbits 30 days severely diabetic rabbits (i) decreased elevated lipids TC, TG, (LDL + VLDL)C increased decreased (HDL)C, (ii) decreased elevated liver heart total lipids, TC TG, (iii) increased decreased liver muscle glycogen, (iv) increased decreased hexokinase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, (v) decreased increased glucose-6-phosphatase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, aldose reductase. Results thus show treatment GII compound purified fenugreek seeds 15 days subdiabetic moderately diabetic 30 days severely diabetic rabbits corrects altered serum lipids, tissue lipids, glycogen, enzymes glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogen metabolism, polyol pathway antioxidant enzymes. Histopathological abnormalities (fatty infiltration cellular changes) seen pancreas, liver, heart kidneys repaired treatment GII. fact partially damaged pancreas repaired. Liver kidney function test results normal GII treated animals indicating GII treatment safe free side effects.
