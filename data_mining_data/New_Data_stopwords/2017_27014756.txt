 BACKGROUND AIMS: Colorectal cancer screening programmes target detection excision adenomatous colonic polyps shown reduce colorectal cancer related mortality. Many screening programmes include initial faecal occult blood test (FOBt) prior colonoscopy. refine selection patients colonoscopy faecal-based diagnostic tools proposed, including tumour M2-pyruvate kinase (tM2-PK). determine whether tM2-PK quantification may role diverse settings assessed assay cohort patients derived England bowel cancer screening programme (BCSP) symptomatic individuals presenting secondary care. METHOD: Patients undergoing colonoscopy provided faecal samples prior bowel preparation. Faecal tM2-PK concentrations measured ELISA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value ROC analyses calculated. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients returned faecal samples: 50 adenomas 7 cancer. Median age 68. Median faecal tM2-PK concentration 3.8 U/mL individuals without neoplastic findings colonoscopy, 7.7 U/mL adenomas 24.4 U/mL subjects colorectal cancer (both, p=0.01). ROC analysis demonstrated AUROC 0.66 (sensitivity 72.4%, specificity 48.7%, positive predictive value 67.7%, negative predictive value 36.7%). Amongst BCSP patients prior positive FOBt faecal tM2-PK abundant (median 6.4 U/mL, p=0.03) diagnostic accuracy greater (AUROC 0.82). CONCLUSION: findings confirm faecal tM2-PK ELISA may utility adjunct FOBt screening context, support use symptomatic patients.
