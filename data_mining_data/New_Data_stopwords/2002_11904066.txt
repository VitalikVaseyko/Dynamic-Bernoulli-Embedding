 OBJECTIVE: introduce safe specific approach (13)C magnetic resonance spectrum ((13)C MRS) spectroscopy investigate alterations hepatic anabolism. METHODS: Relative anaplerotic, pyruvate recycling gluconeogenic fluxes measured (13)C MRS isotopomer analysis blood glucose rats 40% body surface area burn injury, rats exposed sham injury. short chain fatty acid, [U (13)C] propionate avidly extracted liver, infused intravenously deliver (13)C citric acid cycle. Proton-decoupled (13)C MRS deproteinized plasma extracts freeze-clamped liver used determine distribution (13)C blood hepatic glucose. RESULTS: difference multiplets detected glucose carbon-2 anomer blood liver 45 60 minutes infusion propionate, indicating steady-state isotopic conditions achieved. Gluconeogenesis relative citric acid cycle flux altered burn injury; sham burn groups rate glucose production equal flux citrate synthase. sham group animals, rate entry carbon skeletons citric acid cycle 4 times burn group. Similarly, flux pyruvate kinase (again relative citrate synthase) significantly increased burn injury. CONCLUSIONS: Since results analysis blood glucose hepatic glucose, (13)C distribution glucose hepatic metabolism assessed based (13)C MRS analysis blood glucose.
