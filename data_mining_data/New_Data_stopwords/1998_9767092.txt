 homotetrameric pyruvate kinases (PK) constitute fine example allosteric enzymes subjected sophisticated regulatory mechanisms. cloned sequenced Zymomonas mobilis structural gene first prokaryotic dimeric PK, initial step toward understanding peculiar properties enzyme. deduced amino acid sequence pyk gene consists 475 residues calculated molecular mass 51.4kDa exhibits 50% sequence identity PKs. Heterologous expression Escherichia coli obtained native promoter, pyk gene control strong inducible promoter ribosome-binding site present upstream putative TTG start codon pyk gene. Kinetic characterization PK concentrated crude cell extracts showed enzyme activated sugar phosphates AMP slightly inhibited ATP. Thus, PK Z. mobilis unique among characterized prokaryotic PKs due high activity absence allosteric activator. Amino acid sequence alignments revealed glutamate 381 may play role ineffective binding usual PK activator, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
