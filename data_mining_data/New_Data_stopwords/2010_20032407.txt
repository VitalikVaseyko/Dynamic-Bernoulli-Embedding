 HeLa PANC-1 cells exposed conflicting signals promoting anaerobic aerobic energy-generating processes viability, cell numbers ability HeLa cells form colonies assessed. conventional aerobic cell culture 5% CO(2), dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor enzyme pyruvate dehydrogense kinase subsequent stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase redirects energy metabolism toward Kreb cycle, reduced HeLa PANC-1 cellular proliferation viability. nitrogen-induced hypoxia, number control cells cells cultured 12.5 mM DCA paradoxically greater normoxic controls similar conditions. higher medium pH cells cultured nitrogen contributed differences. 96-well experiments, 95% nitrogen 5% CO(2) reduced numbers hypoxic cells medium pH toward aerobic controls, retention DCA-induced hypoxic compared normoxic cell numbers. media cells cultured DCA still exhibited increased pH. Increased hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF1A) mRNA expression hypoxic HeLa cells greater reliance D-glucose metabolic energy confirmed reliability incubation conditions. Compared normoxic cells, hypoxic cells initially increased synthesis ATP, proliferation ceased, longer closely correlated cell numbers. Type 1 apoptosis, somewhat greater hypoxic normoxic cells, contributed hypoxia DCA-induced cell death. Colony counts hypoxic, DCA-inhibited cells subsequently switched normoxia exceeded similarly treated normoxic DCA cells. Despite inhibition certain hypoxic environments pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase DCA contribution increased cellular apoptosis necrosis, hypoxic cells generally outnumbered normoxic control cells, hypoxic DCA-treated cells compared comparable DCA-treated normoxic cells. Since vivo hypoxic cells considered major factor contributing therapeutic failure, DCA redirects energy metabolism toward energy efficient Kreb citric acid cycle, associated increased medium (and inferred cellular) pH, similar circumstances vivo could promote proliferation survival hypoxic cell clones potential developing unwanted properties.
