 Succinic acid, C4 dicarboxylic acid used many fields food, agriculture, pharmaceutical polymer industries. study, microbial production succinic acid Palmaria palmata investigated first time. engineered Escherichia coli KLPPP, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate formate lyase, phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase pyruvate oxidase genes deleted phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase overexpressed. recombinant exhibited higher molar yield succinic acid galactose (1.20+/-0.02mol/mol) glucose (0.48+/-0.03mol/mol). concentration molar yield succinic acid 22.40+/-0.12g/L 1.13+/-0.02mol/mol total sugar respectively 72h dual phase fermentation P. palmata hydrolysate composed glucose (12.57+/-0.17g/L) galactose (18.03+/-0.10g/L). results demonstrate P. palmata red macroalgae biomass represents novel economically alternative feedstock biochemicals production.
