 clarify carbon source-dependent control glycolytic pathway yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, initiated study transcriptional regulation pyruvate kinase gene (PYK). deletion analysis 5'-noncoding region PYK gene, identified upstream activating sequence (UASPYK1) located 634 653 nucleotides upstream initiating ATG codon. promoter activity PYK 5'-noncoding region abolished sequence containing UASPYK1 deleted region. Synthetic UASPYK1 (26mer), either orientation, able restore transcriptional activity UAS-depleted mutants placed upstream TATA sequence located -199 (ATG +1). UASPYK1 required basal intermediate levels transcriptional activation, sequence -714 -811 found necessary full activation. hand, sequence -344 -468 found responsible transcriptional repression PYK gene yeast cells grown nonfermentable carbon sources. upstream repressible sequence also repressed transcription, although lesser extent, glucose present medium. possible mechanism carbon source-dependent regulation PYK expression cis-acting regulatory elements discussed.
