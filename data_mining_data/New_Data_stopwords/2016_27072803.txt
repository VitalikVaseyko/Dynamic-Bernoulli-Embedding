 Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), member HSP90 family, controls variety physiological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival. studies devoted understanding anti-apoptotic roles TRAP1 cancer targeting tumor control clinical settings. Additionally, identified new role TRAP1 regulation liver regeneration partial hepatectomy TRAP1 transgenic mice cellular proliferation TRAP1-overexpressing cells, via mitochondrial alterations. Moreover, recent works indicated role TRAP1 regulation cancer stem cells (CSCs) well metabolic switch mitochondrial respiration aerobic glycolysis called "Warburg effect." review discusses implications TRAP1 action metabolism regulation CSCs.
