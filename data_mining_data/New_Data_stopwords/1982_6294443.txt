 healthy human livers, L pyruvate kinase (L PK) detected immunofluorescence double labelling hepatocytes PK detected bile duct epithelial cells. Numerous associations isoenzyme type hepatological lesion observed. 10 cases ethanolic cirrhosis, L PK simultaneously observed hepatocytes regenerative nodules, biliary neoductules; fibrotic regions L PK negative hepatocytes anastomosing plate system almost exclusively L PK positive, normal subjects. 12 hepatocarcinomas, cancer cells double L specificity variations intensity isoenzyme, stroma reaction L negative. five hepatoblastomas, simultaneous presence L PK also observed, consistently marked intensity PK argues favour embryonic nature type cancer. results suggest mature, highly differentiated cells exclusively specifically synthesize one isoenzyme. double specificity pathology reflects dysfunctional state hepatic biliary epithelial cells dedifferentiated state may terminate appearance cancer.
