 BACKGROUND: Activation Bax Bak, act permeabilize mitochondrial membrane, essential step cell death response therefore suppression tumorigenesis. However, mechanisms regulate activation poorly understood. METHODS: Bax Bak activation (conformational change dimerization) monitored Rat-1 fibroblasts human cancer cells subjected endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, DNA damage, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) treatment. Pharmacologic inhibitors reactive oxygen species production, electron transport respiratory chain, oxidative phosphorylation, appropriate controls used identify potential modes Bax Bak activation cell death response controlled. oligomerization state Bax Bak determined cross-linking subsequent immunoblot analysis; Bax conformational change analyzed immunoprecipitation immunoblotting antibody specific active conformation. Cell death evaluated dye exclusion. RESULTS: fibroblasts human cancer cells subjected cell death stimuli, inhibition oxidative phosphorylation use antimycin oligomycin prevented ER stress-, DNA damage-, TNF-alpha-induced Bax Bak activation cell death (UV-induced Rat-1 cell death 15 hours: control, mean = 33.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.8% 48.4%; antimycin A, mean = 10.0%, 95% CI = 0% 21.7%; oligomycin, mean = 13.1%, 95% CI = 5.7% 20.5%; tunicamycin-induced MCF-7 cell death 9 hours: control, mean = 29.2%, 95% CI = 21.6% 36.8%; antimycin A, mean = 15.3%, 95% CI = 0.8% 29.8%; oligomycin, mean = 11.5%, 95% CI = 3.9% 19.1%; TNF-alpha-induced MCF-7 cell death 6 hours: control, mean = 24.0%, 95% CI = 12.6% 35.4%; antimycin A, mean = 8.9%, 95% CI = 3.9% 13.9%; oligomycin, mean = 13.3%, 95% CI = 10.4% 16.2%). Increasing decreasing glycolytic adenosine triphosphate production, adding glucose 2-deoxy-D-glucose cell growth medium, respectively, neither reversed recapitulated, respectively, effect compromised oxidative phosphorylation Bax Bak activation. CONCLUSION: Oxidative phosphorylation required activation Bax Bak cell death triggered disparate death stimuli. reliance tumor cells glycolysis preference oxidative phosphorylation even normoxic conditions (Warburg effect) may therefore potential means cells evade programmed cell death.
