 INS-r3-GK27 insulinoma cells endowed artificially inducible glucokinase control reverse tetracycline-dependent transcriptional activator. Moderate induction glucokinase shown result proportionate increases glycolytic flux potentiation glucose effects insulin secretion pyruvate kinase gene expression. cells 20-fold overexpression glucokinase, however, glucose activation secretion gene expression severely impaired. Measurements glycolytic flux cells 7- 21-fold increases glucokinase activity determination flux control coefficient enzyme showed control glycolysis glucokinase step lost cells higher level overexpression. Challenging cells glucose 6 mM resulted massive accumulation glucose 6-phosphate caused rapid sustained depletion cellular ATP, contrast glucose-induced rise ATP cells wild-type glucokinase levels. Loss cell viability ensued upon prolonged culture high glucose. summary, insulinoma beta cells strongly overexpressing glucokinase, imbalance glucose phosphorylation turnover glucose 6-phosphate resulted acute glucose intolerance due trapping cellular orthophosphate dead-end product severe paralysis energy metabolism.
