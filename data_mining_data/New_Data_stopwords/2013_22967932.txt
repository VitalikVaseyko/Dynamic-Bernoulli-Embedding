 ATP-sensitive-K(+) (KATP) channels couple metabolism electrical activity cells. channel associated glycolytic enzymes form complexes regulating channel activity various tissues. pyruvate-kinase (PK) enzyme antigen Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated Streptococcal infection known PANDAS characterized abnormal production auto-antibodies PK. Here, effects anti-pyruvate kinase antibody (anti-PK-ab) muscle neuronal KATP channels investigated native rat skeletal muscle fibres human neuroblastoma cell-line (SH-SY5Y), respectively. Furthermore, interaction PK inwardly rectifier potassium channel (Kir6.1/Kir6.2) subunits KATP channels investigated co-immunoprecipitation experiments mouse brain using anti-PK-ab. Patch-clamp experiments showed short-term incubation (1h) fibres anti-PK-ab dilutions 1:500 1:300 enhanced KATP current 19.6% 33.5%, respectively. opposite, long-term incubation (24h) fibres anti-PK-ab dilutions 1:500 1:300 reduced KATP current 16% 24%, respectively, reducing diameter atrophy. direct application anti-PK-ab excised patches absence intracellular ATP caused channel block, presence nucleotide channel opened. neuronal cell line, short-term anti-PK-ab potentiated KATP currents without affecting survival, long-term anti-PK-ab reduced KATP currents inducing neuronal death. Opening/blocking actions anti-PK antibodies KATP channels observed, blocking action causes fibre atrophy neuronal death. demonstrated PK Kir subunits physically/functionally coupled neurons. KATP/PK complex proposed novel target autoimmune diseases associated anti-PK production PANDAS.
