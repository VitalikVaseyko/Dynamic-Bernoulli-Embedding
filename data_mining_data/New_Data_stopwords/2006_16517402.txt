 Hypoxic cells induce glycolytic enzymes; HIF-1-mediated metabolic adaptation increases glucose flux pyruvate produces glycolytic ATP. Two papers issue Cell Metabolism (Kim et al., 2006; Papandreou et al., 2006) demonstrate HIF-1 also influences mitochondrial function, suppressing TCA cycle respiration inducing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 regulation hypoxic cells promotes cell survival.
