 regimen aerobic training sea level recovery high altitude used athletes improve performance. However, little known effects hypoxia combined sprint interval training performance. aim present study determine effect "living high-sprint training low" strategy hemoglobin, hematocrit erythropoietin levels rats. also wanted test whether addition hypoxic stress program daily treadmill running high speeds induces expressional adaptations skeletal muscle affects performance. protein content peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), cytochrome C, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) citrate synthase activity determined different muscle fiber types animals (red white gastrocnemius muscle). also determined maximal aerobic velocity (MAV) training period. total 24 male Wistar rats (3 month old) randomly divided four experimental groups: normoxic control group (n = 6), normoxic trained group (n = 6), hypoxic control group (12 h pO(2) 12%/12 h pO(2) 21%) (n = 6) hypoxic trained group (12 h pO(2) 12%/12 h pO(2) 21%). Living normobaric hypoxia condition 21 days significantly increased hemoglobin, hematocrit erythropoietin levels rest trained groups. trained animals (normoxia hypoxia) significantly increased maximal aerobic velocity. changes found skeletal muscle PGC-1alpha, cytochrome C, PDK1, HSP70, MnSOD protein content citrate synthase activity experimental group. Regardless whether combined sprint interval training not, 21 days living high altitude found significant increase hematological values determined study. However, contrary starting hypothesis, combination normobaric hypoxia sprint training improve MAV animals.
