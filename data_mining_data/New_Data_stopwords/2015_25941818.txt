 Hypoxia defined reduction oxygen supply tissue physiological levels. However, physiological hypoxic conditions occur early embryonic development; adult organisms, many cells bone marrow stem cells located within hypoxic niches. Thus, certain processes take place hypoxia, recent studies highlight relevance hypoxia stem cell cancer physiology. Cellular response hypoxia depends hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), stabilized low oxygen conditions. hypoxic context, various inducible HIF alpha subunits able form dimers constant beta subunits bind hypoxia response elements (HRE) genome, acting transcription factors, inducing wide variety gene expression. Typically, HIF pathway shown enhance vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, would responsible angiogenesis and, therefore, re-oxygenation hypoxic sites. Embryonic stem cells inhibit severely hypoxic environment, dictates glycolytic metabolism, whereas differentiated cells shift toward efficient aerobic respiration metabolic demands. Accordingly, low oxygen tension levels reported enhance induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) generation. HIFs also shown enhance pluripotency-related gene expression, including Oct4 (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4), Nanog Wnt. Therefore, cell metabolism might play role stemness maintenance, proliferation cell reprogramming. Moreover, hypoxic microenvironment cancer cells, metabolism shifts oxidative phosphorylation anaerobic glycolysis, process known Warburg effect, involved cancer progression malignancy.
