 Reprogrammed metabolism key feature cancer cells. pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform, commonly upregulated many human cancers, recently shown play crucial role metabolism reprogramming, gene transcription cell cycle progression. Cell Science glance article accompanying poster, provide brief overview recent advances understanding mechanisms underlying regulation PKM2 expression, enzymatic activity, metabolic functions subcellular location. highlight instrumental role non-metabolic functions PKM2 tumorigenesis evaluate potential target PKM2 cancer treatment.
