 Although Artemisia iwayomogi (AI) shown improve lipid metabolism, mode action poorly understood. study, 95% ethanol extract AI (95EEAI) identified potent ligand peroxisome proliferator-activated receptordelta (PPARdelta) using ligand binding analysis cell-based reporter assay. cultured primary human skeletal muscle cells, treatment 95EEAI increased expression two important PPARdelta-regulated genes, carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-1 (CPT1) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4), several genes acting lipid efflux energy expenditure. Furthermore, 95EEAI stimulated fatty acid oxidation PPARdelta-dependent manner. High-fat diet-induced obese mice model indicated administration 95EEAI attenuated diet-induced obesity activation fatty acid oxidation skeletal muscle. results suggest 95% ethanol extract AI may role new functional food material prevention and/or treatment hyperlipidermia obesity.
