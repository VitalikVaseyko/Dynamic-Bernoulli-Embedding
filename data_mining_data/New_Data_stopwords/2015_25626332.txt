 presented case displays clinical study cancer phenotype poor clinical outcome. Prediction cancer development effects treatment beginning clinical stage difficult knowledge cancer process necessary parameters host body limited. Cancer mainly studied basis biochemical-genetic processes morphological manifestation. However, malignant process assumed essential biophysical nature develops mitochondrial dysfunction, direct result oncogene mutation. Cancers based normal reverse Warburg effect distinguished. cancer tumors reverse Warburg effect display aggressiveness associated high rate recurrence metastatic implantation. Besides nature two basic types breast cancer tumors outcome depends type, size, site also reactions interaction surrounding tissue body aptitude metastatic activity connected individual blood lymphatic vessels metastatic transport. necessary assess favourable adverse factors cancer development. General reliable method specification cancers available. Nevertheless, main factor seems aggressiveness cancer cells follows interpretation. reveal aggressive reverse Warburg effect tumors, metabolic biomarkers fibroblast stress examined.
