 kinetic study ATP-ADP amplification cyclic system involving enzymes adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase L-lactate dehydrogenase made. stoichiometry cycle 2:1, two molecules ADP synthesized one ATP AMP, one molecule ADP converted back one ATP turn cycle. results continuous exponential increase concentrations ATP ADP reaction medium, according equations obtained. therefore substrate cycle amplifies itself, cycling rate increasing continuously time. background signal reagent reduced using apyrase degrade ATP ADP reagent, permitting detection limits low 16 pmol ATP and/or ADP continuous spectrophotometric assay.
