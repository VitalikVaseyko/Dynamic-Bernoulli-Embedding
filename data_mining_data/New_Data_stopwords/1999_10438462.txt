 examined transcript levels variety oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) associated bioenergetic genes tissues patient carrying myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS) A3243G mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation skeletal muscles 14 patients harboring pathogenic mtDNA mutations. patients' tissues, harbored 88% mutant mtDNA, increased levels mtDNA transcripts, increased nuclear OXPHOS gene transcripts including ATP synthase beta subunit heart-muscle isoform adenine nucleotide translocator, increased ancillary gene transcripts including muscle mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase, muscle glycogen phosphorylase, hexokinase I, muscle phosphofructokinase, E1alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase, ubiquinone oxidoreductase. similar coordinate induction bioenergetic genes observed muscle biopsies severe pathologic mtDNA mutations. significant coordinated expression found muscle patients MELAS, myoclonic epilepsy ragged red fibers, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia deletion syndromes, ragged red muscle fibers mitochondrial paracrystalline inclusions. High levels mutant mtDNAs linked high induction mtDNA nuclear OXPHOS genes several associated bioenergetic genes. observations suggest human tissues attempt compensate OXPHOS defects associated mtDNA mutations stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, possibly mediated redox-sensitive transcription factors.
