 present study designed evaluate use tumor marker Tumor M2-PK discrimination gastrointestinal (Gl) cancer patients patients non malignant gastrointestinal diseases. concentration Tumor M2-PK analyzed EDTA-plasma 413 Gl cancer-patients 141 patients non-malignant diseases. test resulted highly significant discrimination (p < 0.001) tumor patients controls. diagnostic specificity 89%. diagnostic sensitivity 48% 73%, depending different tumor entities (colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer pancreatic cancer), observed. sensitivities generally higher compared established tumor markers CEA, CA 19-9 CA 72-4, exception CA 19-9 pancreatic cancer. combination Tumor M2-PK appropriate first choice-marker (e.g. CEA + Tumor M2-PK colorectal cancer) resulted remarkable increase sensitivities.
