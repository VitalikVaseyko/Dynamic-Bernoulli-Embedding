 PURPOSE: G-protein coupled receptor 34 (GPR34), belongs G-protein coupled receptors superfamily, reportedly expressed highly spread several solid tumors. However, expression gastric primary tumor potential role gastric cancer development progression determined. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, real-time RT-PCR western blot methods used determine GPR34 expression human gastric cancer tissues/cell lines matched adjacent tissues/ normal mucosal cell line. statistical analysis performed establish potential correlation GPR34 expression patients' clinicopathological characteristics, tumor progression, prognosis. Stably transfected NCI-N87 cell lines either GPR34 over-expression knock-down constructed determine effect GPR34 gastric cancer cell invasion migration, explain preliminary molecular mechanism GPR34 gastric cancer metastasis. RESULTS: GPR34 up-regulated primary gastric cancer tissues/cell lines compared matched adjacent tissues/normal mucosal cell line, relationship GPR34 expression clinicopathological characteristics analyzed, shown GPR34 expression significantly correlated tumor differentiation, infiltration depth, lymph node status significant influence prognosis. Furthermore, GPR34-overexpression increased GPR34-knockdown inhibited NCI-N87 cell invasion vitro PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, up-regulation GPR34 expression human gastric carcinoma may play critical role tumor progression determining patient prognosis. GPR34 may useful diagnostic prognostic molecular biomarker, potential target therapeutic intervention.
