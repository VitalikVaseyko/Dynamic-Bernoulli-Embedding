 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants unable grow ferment glucose isolated. 45 clones isolated, 25 single enzyme defects one following activities: phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi), phosphofructokinase (pfk), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi), phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk), phosphoglyceromutase (pgm), pyruvate kinase (pyk). Phosphofructokinase activities crude extracts pfk mutant 2% wild-type level. However, normal growth glucose medium normal fermentation glucose suggested either mutant enzyme considerably active vivo or, alternatively, 2% residual activity sufficient normal glycolysis. mutants moderately strongly inhibited glucose. Unusually high concentrations glycolytic metabolites observed reaction catalyzed enzyme absent given mutant strain incubated glucose. confirmed cellular level location defect determined enzyme assays. adh (lacks three alcohol dehydrogenase isozymes) pgk mutants, accumulation typical levels hexosephosphates prevented respiration blocked antimycin A. typical feature glycolytic mutants described rapid depletion intracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate pool transfer glucose medium. correlation low high levels fructose-1,6-bisphosphate degree catabolite repression inactivation could found. observation support concept hexose metabolites directly involved regulatory mechanisms yeast.
