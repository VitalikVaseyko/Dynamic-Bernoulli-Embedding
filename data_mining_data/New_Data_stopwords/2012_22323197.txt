 Non-migratory, stream-resident populations threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, lower maximum oxygen consumption ((O(2),max)) ancestral migratory marine populations. Here, examined laboratory-bred stream-resident marine crosses two locations (West Bonsall Creeks) determine steps oxygen transport utilization cascade evolved conjunction with, thus potential contribute to, differences (O(2),max). found West Creek stream-resident fish larger muscle fibres (not measured Bonsall fish), Bonsall Creek stream-resident fish smaller ventricles, stream-resident populations evolved smaller pectoral adductor abductor muscles. However, many steps oxygen cascade evolve stream-resident populations (gill surface area, hematocrit, mean cellular hemoglobin content activities mitochondrial enzymes per gram ventricle pectoral muscle), arguing symmorphosis. also studied F1 hybrids determine traits oxygen cascade genetic architecture similar (O(2),max). West Creek, (O(2),max), abductor adductor size showed dominance marine alleles, whereas Bonsall Creek, (O(2),max) ventricle mass showed dominance stream-resident alleles. also found genetically based differences among marine populations hematocrit, ventricle mass, pectoral muscle mass pectoral muscle pyruvate kinase activity. Overall, reductions pectoral muscle mass evolved conjunction reductions (O(2),max) stream-resident populations, specific steps oxygen cascade genetic basis similar (O(2),max), thus predicted largest impact (O(2),max), differ among populations.
