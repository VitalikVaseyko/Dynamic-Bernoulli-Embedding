 investigate short-term (30-240 min) interactions among nitrogenase activity, NH4+ assimilation, plant glycolysis, measured concentrations selected C N metabolites alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) root nodules detopping continuous exposure nodulated roots Ar:O2 (80:20, v/v). treatments caused increase ratios glucose-6-phosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, fructose-6-phosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate, PEP malate. suggested glycolytic flux inhibited steps catalyzed phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, PEP carboxylase. Ar:O2-treated plants apparent inhibition glycolytic flux reversible, whereas detopped plants not. groups plants apparent inhibition glycolytic flux delayed relative decline nitrogenase activity. decline nitrogenase activity followed dramatic increase nodular glutamate glutamine ratio. detopped plants coincident apparent inhibition glycolytic flux, whereas Ar:O2-treated plants preceded apparent inhibition glycolytic flux. propose increase nodular glutamate glutamine ratio, occurs result decline nitrogenase activity, may act signal decrease plant glycolytic flux legume root nodules.
