 subpopulation human peripheral blood lymphocytes capable binding human (autologous allogeneic) erythrocytes, forming rosettes. conditions lead autorosette formation similar required sheep red-cell rosetting. Ageing human erythrocytes shown bear less determinants involved phenomenon younger ones. Evidence presented autorosetting T-cell marker. autorosette-forming cells sensitive inhibiting effects ATG could therefore belong T-cell subpopulation.
