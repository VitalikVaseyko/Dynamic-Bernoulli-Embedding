 triplicate intracerebroventricular (icv) application diabetogenic compound streptozotocin (STZ) low dosage used 1-year-old male Wistar rats induce damage neuronal insulin signal transduction (IST) system investigate activities hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH) frontoparietotemporal brain cortex (ct) hippocampus (h) 9 weeks damage. parallel, concentrations adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP) creatine phosphate (CrP) determined. found reductions HK 53% (ct) 60% (h) control, PFK 63/64% (ct/h); GDH 56/61% (ct/h), PFK 57/59% (ct/h), alpha-KGDH 37/35% (ct/h) increase LDH 300/240% (ct/h). ATP decreased 82/87% (ct/h) control, GTP 69/81% (ct/h), CrP 82/81% (ct/h), approximately P 82/82% (ct/h), whereas ADP increased 189/154% (ct/h). fall activities glycolytic enzymes HK, PFK, GDH PK found marked 9 weeks damage compared 3- 6-week damage whereas diminution concentration energy rich compound stably reduced 20 10% relative control. abnormalities glucose/energy metabolism discussed relation tau-protein mismetabolism experimental animals, sporadic AD.
