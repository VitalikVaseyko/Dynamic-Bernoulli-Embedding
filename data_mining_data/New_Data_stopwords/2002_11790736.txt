 anaerobic conditions, yeast Saccharomyces bulderi rapidly ferments delta-gluconolactone ethanol carbon dioxide. propose novel pathway delta-gluconolactone fermentation operates yeast. pathway, delta-gluconolactone first reduced glucose via NADPH-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.47). phosphorylation, half glucose metabolized via pentose phosphate pathway, yielding NADPH required glucose-dehydrogenase reaction. remaining half glucose dissimilated via glycolysis. Involvement novel pathway delta-gluconolactone fermentation S. bulderi supported several experimental observations. (i) Fermentation delta-gluconolactone gluconate occurred low pH values, substantial fraction substrate present delta-gluconolactone. Unlike gluconate, latter compound substrate glucose dehydrogenase. (ii) High activities NADP(+)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase detected cell extracts anaerobic, delta-gluconolactone-grown cultures, activity enzyme detected glucose-grown cells. Gluconate kinase activity cell extracts negligible. (iii) anaerobic growth delta-gluconolactone, CO(2) production exceeded ethanol production 35%, indicating pyruvate decarboxylation sole source CO(2). (iv) Levels pentose phosphate pathway enzymes 10-fold higher delta-gluconolactone-grown anaerobic cultures glucose-grown cultures, consistent proposed involvement pathway primary dissimilatory route delta-gluconolactone metabolism.
