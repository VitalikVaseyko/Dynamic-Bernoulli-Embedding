 RBM4 promotes differentiation neuronal progenitor cells neurite outgrowth cultured neurons via role splicing regulation. study, explored role RBM4 neuronal differentiation. neuronal differentiation, energy production shifts glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation. found splice isoform change metabolic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM) PKM2 PKM1 occurs brain development impaired RBM4-deficient brains. PKM isoform change could recapitulated human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) neuronal induction. Using PKM minigene, demonstrated RBM4 plays direct role regulating alternative splicing PKM. Moreover, RBM4 antagonized function splicing factor PTB induced expression PTB isoform attenuated splicing activity MSCs. Overexpression RBM4 PKM1 induced expression neuronal genes, increased mitochondrial respiration capacity MSCs, and, accordingly, promoted neuronal differentiation. Finally, demonstrated RBM4 induced involved PKM splicing switch neuronal gene expression hypoxia-induced neuronal differentiation. Hence, RBM4 plays important role PKM isoform switch change mitochondrial energy production neuronal differentiation.
