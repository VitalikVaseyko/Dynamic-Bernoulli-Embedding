 rapid technic age-fractionation human erythrocytes reticulocyte-enriched (young) red blood cells reticulocyte-poor (old) red blood cells using isopycnic density gradient centrifugation Percoll-Renografin evaluated use autologous red blood cell antigen determinations multiply-transfused patients. fractionation demonstrated statistically significant density-related changes pyruvate kinase acetylcholinesterase activities (P = 0.002 0.042, respectively) distribution reticulocytes gradient (P less 0.005). initial reticulocyte counts less equal 1.5%, reticulocyte counts 78% achieved (means = 25%; n = 31). starting reticulocyte counts greater 5%, samples containing 98% reticulocytes obtained (means = 64%; n = 7). technic requires less two hours, uses isotonic media, nontoxic red blood cells. Volumes red blood cells 10 mL fractionated one time gradient medium stable refrigerated 4 degrees C. Red blood cell typing performed six patients received 4-29 units blood within 12-hour period. Within 72 hours posttransfusion, typing reticulocyte enriched fraction correctly identified patient's red blood cell antigens 16 antisera tested. technic typing reticulocyte-enriched samples importance confirmation antibody specificity determining whether antibody alloantibody autoantibody, selection donor blood transfusion patients autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
