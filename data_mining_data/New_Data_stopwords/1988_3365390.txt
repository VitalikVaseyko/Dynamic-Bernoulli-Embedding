 (Z)-3-(Fluoromethyl)phosphoenolpyruvate synthesized nine chemical steps glyoxylic acid. compound stable pH 3, pH 8 decomposes within seconds give 2-oxo-3-butenoate. 3-(fluoromethyl)phosphoenolpyruvate added solution phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase, enzyme inactivated course hour. Identical kinetics inactivation observed whether reaction initiated addition 3-(fluoromethyl)-phosphoenolpyruvate, preformed 2-oxo-3-butenoate, 4-fluoro-2-oxobutanoate (which rapidly undergoes elimination fluoride ion form 2-oxo-3-butenoate). inactivating species cases believed 2-oxo-3-butenoate. inactivation completely prevented presence dithiothreitol, reacts rapidly 2-oxo-3-butenoate. Studies competitive inhibitors enzymes indicate inactivation occur active site.
