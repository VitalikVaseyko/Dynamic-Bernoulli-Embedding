 Liver cell sap normally fed rats, rats fed high-carbohydrate diet fasted rats chromatographed DEAE-cellulose (pH 7.0). chromatogram diet group analyzed pyruvate kinase activity endogenous substrates cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase. materials pooled five phosphorylatable fractions, phosphate incorporation 0.1 mM 1.0 mM [32P]ATP presence cyclic AMP protein kinase determined. characterization phosphorylatable components, thin-layer gel chromatography Sephadex G-200 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detergent used determination native minimal molecular weights, respectively. Except pyruvate kinase, eight components incorporated least 0.05 nmol [32P]phosphate/g liver detected. phosphorylation four stimulated cyclic AMP. minimal molecular weights 42000, 21000, 52000 49000. component minimal molecular weight 42000 seemed native molecular weight 160000. 21000 52000 component native molecular weight 110000-120000. protein minimal molecular weight 49000 could correlated certainty native molecular weight. proteins whose phosphorylation stimulated cyclic AMP minimal molecular weights 54000, 39000, 34000 22000.
