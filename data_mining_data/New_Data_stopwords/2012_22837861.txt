 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) progressive fatal disease lung vasculature molecular etiologies unclear. Specific metabolic alterations identified animal models PAH patients, though existing data focus mainly abnormalities glucose homeostasis. hypothesized analysis entire metabolome PAH would reveal multiple metabolic changes relevant disease pathogenesis possible treatment. Layered transcriptomic metabolomic analyses human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC) expressing two different disease-causing mutations bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) confirmed previously described increases aerobic glycolysis also uncovered significant upregulation pentose phosphate pathway, increases nucleotide salvage polyamine biosynthesis pathways, decreases carnitine fatty acid oxidation pathways, major impairment tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle failure anaplerosis. proof principle, focused TCA cycle, predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) activity would altered PAH, demonstrating increased IDH activity cultured hPMVEC expressing mutant BMPR2 also serum PAH patients. results suggest widespread metabolic changes important part PAH pathogenesis, simultaneous identification targeting multiple involved pathways may fruitful therapeutic approach targeting one individual pathway.
