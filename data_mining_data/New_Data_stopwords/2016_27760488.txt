 Cancer cells different metabolism contrast normal cells. advancement omics measurement technology enables genome-wide characterization altered cellular processes cancers, metabolic flux landscape cancer still far understood. study, compared well-reconstructed tissue-specific models five cancers, including breast, liver, lung, renal, urothelial cancer, corresponding normal cells. similar patterns majority significantly regulated pathways enriched pathways correlated reaction sets. differences among cancers also explicit. renal cancer demonstrates dramatic difference cancer models, including smallest number reactions, flux distribution patterns, specifically correlated pathways. also validated predicted essential genes revealed Warburg effect silico simulation renal cancer, consistent measurements renal cancer. conclusion, tissue-specific metabolic model suitable investigate cancer metabolism. similarity heterogenicity metabolic reprogramming different cancers crucial understanding aberrant mechanisms cancer proliferation, fundamental identifying drug targets biomarkers.
