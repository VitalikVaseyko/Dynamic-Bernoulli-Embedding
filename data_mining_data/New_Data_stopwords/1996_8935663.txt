 bradyzoite tachyzoite forms Toxoplasma gondii, purified infected animals, analysed activities phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, NAD(+)- NADH-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases, succinic dehydrogenase. developmental stages contained high activities phosphofructokinase (specific pyrophosphate rather ATP), pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting energy metabolism forms may centre around high glycolytic flux linked lactate production. markedly higher activity latter two enzymes bradyzoites suggests lactate production particularly important developmental form. NAD(+)-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase detectable either stage parasite (and proved useful measure purity bradyzoite preparation), whereas parasite forms contained low activities NADP(+)-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase. results consistent bradyzoites lacking functional TCA cycle respiratory chain suggestive lack susceptibility developmental stage atovaquone.
