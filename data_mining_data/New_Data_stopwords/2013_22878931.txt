 activity L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK, ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) regulated phosphorylation serine residue 12 N-terminal regulatory domain MEGPAGYLRR(10)AS ( 12 )VAQLTQEL(20)GTAFF protein. report studied effect point mutations around phosphorylation site catalytic properties enzyme, introducing amino acids A, L, K, Q E positions 9, 10 13 peptide sequence. found mutations positions 9 10, although occurring great distances enzyme's active site, affected enzyme's activity decreasing effectiveness phosphoenolpyruvate binding (PEP) enzyme, practically influence binding effectiveness second substrate ADP. similar asymmetric effect binding substrates previously observed phosphorylation enzyme regulatory N-domain peptide, also proteolytic truncation N-terminal part L-PK. results could explained internal complex formation N-domain peptide enzyme's main body. present study delineated specificity internal binding site revealed possibility regulatory effect could modulated selecting mutation sites amino acids introduced N-terminal domain structure.
