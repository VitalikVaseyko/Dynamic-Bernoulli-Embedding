 phase relationships glycogen free fatty acids (FFA) digestive (midgut) gland, foot muscle heart muscle starved aestivating giant African snails (Achatina achatina) analysed means phase plane plots. Phase plane plots glycogen FFA content indicated metabolites phase digestive gland phase foot muscle, whereas plot heart muscle long axis parallel abscissa. Digestive gland glycogen phase foot muscle FFA heart muscle FFA. Phase plane plots foot muscle glycogen digestive gland FFA long axis parallel abscissa, whereas plot foot muscle glycogen heart muscle FFA showed metabolites phase. Heart muscle FFA phase either foot muscle FFA digestive gland FFA. Pyruvate kinase extracted foot muscle starved aestivating snails labile behaved like allosteric type exhibiting co-operative interaction respect phosphoenolpyruvate, allosteric activation fructose 1,6-diphosphate inhibition ATP. oscillatory motions glycogen FFA discussed terms anaerobic metabolism aestivating snails.
