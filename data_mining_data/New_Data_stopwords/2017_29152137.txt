 transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) consists oxygen-sensitive HIF-1alpha constitutive HIF-1beta. HIF-1alpha undetectable normal cells, cancer cells frequently express HIF-1alpha support growth, angiogenesis, high glycolysis (also known Warburg effect). Warburg effect cancer cells increases energy expenditure thus participates cancer-induced metabolic disorder, cancer cachexia. present study, investigated whether two components Rheum palmatum, emodin rhein, inhibited HIF-1alpha expression human pancreatic cancer cells whether inhibiting effect, any, attenuated cancer cachexia. Using Western blotting, demonstrated emodin rhein decreased HIF-1alpha expression MiaPaCa2 four human pancreatic cancer cell lines. also examined HIF-1alpha expression MiaPaCa2 cells exposed PX-478, noscapine, phenethyl isothiocyanate, compounds known inhibit HIF-1alpha expression different cancer cells. PX-478 noscapine inhibited HIF-1alpha expression less extent emodin rhein, phenethyl isothiocyanate inhibit HIF-1alpha expression tested concentrations. obtained evidence emodin rhein decreased HIF-1alpha decreasing biosynthesis gene transcription protein stability. MiaPaCa2 cells implanted athymic mice, emodin rhein inhibited cancer-cell growth HIF-1alpha expression. athymic mice, emodin rhein also attenuated two pathological constituents cancer cachexia, namely high hepatic gluconeogenesis skeletal-muscle proteolysis. conclusion, emodin rhein decrease pancreatic cancer cell's growth HIF-1alpha expression attenuate cancer cachexia athymic mice carrying cancer cells.
