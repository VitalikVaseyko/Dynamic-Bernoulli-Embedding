 subunits dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) associate form large inner core protruding structure composed three globular domains connected mobile linker regions. exterior region E2 includes two lipoyl domains engage intermediate reactions complex also integral roles kinase-phosphatase regulatory interconversion pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. facilitate understanding roles, lipoyl domain constructs E2 component human PDC expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-linked fusion proteins plasmid inserts prepared polymerase chain reaction procedures. NH2-terminal lipoyl domain, E2L1, interior lipoyl domain, E2L2, connected 30-amino-acid hinge region, H1. Constructs designed expressed E2L1(1-98), E2L1.H1(1-128), E2L2(120-233), E2H1.L2(98-233), E2L1.H1.L2(1-233), numbers parentheses give amino acid sequence portions E2 component incorporated construct. domains expressed Escherichia coli without lipoate supplementation. GST constructs purified homogeneity affinity chromatography selectively released thrombin treatment. Sequencing insert DNAs NH2-terminal sequencing confirmed domains produced designed. Measurement masses electrospray mass spectrometry indicated constructs lipoylated, nonlipoylated, octanoylated forms produced expression E. coli grown without lipoate supplementation fully lipoylated forms produced upon lipoate supplementation. lipoylation status confirmed, following delipoylation Enterococcus faecalis lipoamidase, expected decrease mass observation native gel electrophoresis shift slower mobility (possibly less compact) form. Constructs used E1-catalyzed reductive-acetylation reaction proportion degree lipoylation effective substrates NADH-dependent dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase reduction reaction. Thus, produced lipoyl domain constructs employed sorting specific roles E2L1 E2L2 facilitating catalytic regulatory processes.
