 Escherichia coli polyphosphate kinase (PPK) known catalyze reversible transfer phosphate molecules ATP polyphosphate (poly(P)). also found PPK catalyzes kination ADP also nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) using poly(P) phosphate donor, yielding nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). used PPK poly(P) place pyruvate kinase phosphoenol pyruvate NTP regeneration followed synthesis sugar nucleotides cyclic synthesis system oligosaccharides. confirmed PPK efficiently catalyzed UTP regeneration cyclic system N-acetyllactosamine synthesis. novel activity PPK enables us perform practical synthesis oligosaccharides.
