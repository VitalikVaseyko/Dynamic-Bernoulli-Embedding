 Paclitaxel, one commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic agents, active wide spectrum human cancer. mechanism cytotoxicity, however, remains controversial. results indicate paclitaxel treatment increases levels superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide (NO), oxidative DNA adducts, G2-M arrest, cells fragmented nuclei. Antioxidants pyruvate selenium, synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, scavenger manganese (III) 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide decreased paclitaxel-mediated DNA damage sub-G1 cells. contrast, glutamylcysteine synthase inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) increased sub-G1 fraction paclitaxel-treated cells. results suggest reactive oxygen nitrogen species involved paclitaxel cytotoxicity. notion supported observation concentrations paclitaxel required inhibit cell growth 50% correlate total antioxidant capacity. Moreover, agents arsenic trioxide (As2O3), BSO, 2-ME, PD98059, U0126 [mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitors], LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor), decrease clonogenic survival, also decrease total antioxidant capacity paclitaxel-treated cells, regardless whether paclitaxel sensitive paclitaxel resistant. results suggest paclitaxel chemosensitivity may predicted taking total antioxidant capacity measurements clinical tumor samples. This, turn, may improve treatment outcomes selecting potentially responsive patients.
