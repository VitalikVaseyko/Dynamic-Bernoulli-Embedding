 examined possible implication ras regulation activity several metabolic enzymes employing inducible H-ras expression system (RFLSVrasLAP cell line), addition IPTG decreases levels ras p21 3-fold. measured activity hexokinase (E.C. 2.7.1.1.), glucose phosphate isomerase (E.C. 5.3.1.9), phospho-fructokinase (E.C. 2.7.1.11), aldolase (E.C. 4.1.2.13), phosphoglycerate kinase (E.C. 2.7.2.3), enolase (E.C. 4.2.1.11), pyruvate kinase (E.C. 2.7.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.27), adenosine deaminase (E.C. 3.5.4.4) purine nucleoside phosphorylase (E.C. 2.4.2.1) cells grown presence absence IPTG. found addition IPTG RFLSVrasLAP cells led lower activity phosphoglycerate kinase (p=0.004), enolase (p=0.027) pyruvate kinase (p=0.031). Enolase mRNA levels found increased cells overexpressing either normal mutant H-ras. total rate glycolysis affected H-ras expression indicating implication H-ras activity phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase pyruvate kinase may associated glycolysis-independent functions enzymes. Adenosine deaminase activity found increase IPTG addition (P=0.009), indicating also possible role H-ras control purine nucleotide salvage pathway.
