 substrates oxygen glucose important appropriate regulation metabolism, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis embryonic development. knowledge interaction two signals limited. demonstrated regulation glucagon receptor, insulin receptor L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene expression liver dependent upon cross-talk oxygen glucose. periportal perivenous drop O2 tension proposed endocrine key regulator zonated gene expression liver. primary rat hepatocyte cultures, expression glucagon receptor L-PK mRNA maximally induced glucose arterial pO2 whereas insulin receptor maximally induced perivenous pO2. demonstrated L-PK gene modulation O2 glucose-dependent induction occured glucose-responsive element (Glc(PK)RE) L-PK gene promoter. reduction glucose-dependent induction L-PK gene expression venous pO2 appeared mediated via interference hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) glucose-responsive transcription factors Glc(PK)RE. glucose response element (GlcRE) also functioned hypoxia response element and, vice versa, hypoxia-responsive element functioning GlcRE. Thus, findings implicate cross-talk oxygen glucose might fundamental role regulation several physiological pathophysiological processes.
