 BACKGROUND: Glyceroneogenesis important step control fatty acid re-esterification PEPCK PDK4 identified key enzymes process. previously shown glyceroneogenic enzymes PDK4 rapidly induced white adipose tissue exercise. Recent studies suggested IL-6 regulates adipose tissue metabolism gene expression exercise. Interestingly, IL-6 reported directly decrease PEPCK expression. purpose investigation determine role IL-6 modulating effects exercise expression glyceroneogenic enzymes mouse adipose tissue. hypothesized exercise-mediated induction PDK4 PEPCK would greater adipose tissue IL-6 deficient mice compared wild type controls. METHODOLOGY PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Treatment cultured epididymal adipose tissue (eWAT) IL-6 (150 ng/ml) increased phosphorylation AMPK, ACC STAT3 induced SOCS3 mRNA levels decreasing PEPCK PDK4 mRNA. AICAR decreased expression PDK4 PEPCK. activation AMPK IL-6 independent increases lipolysis. acute bout treadmill running (15 meters/minute, 5% incline, 90 minutes) induce SOCS3 increase phosphorylation STAT3 eWAT, indicating IL-6 signalling activated. Exercise-induced increases PEPCK PDK4 mRNA expression attenuated eWAT IL-6(-/-) mice parallel greater relative increase AMPK phosphorylation compared exercised WT mice. changes occurred independent alterations beta-adrenergic signalling adipose tissue IL-6(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS SIGNIFICANCE: findings question role IL-6 signalling adipose tissue exercise suggest indirect effect cytokine regulation adipose tissue gene expression exercise.
