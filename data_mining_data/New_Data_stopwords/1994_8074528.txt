 Pyruvate kinase activity important element flux control intermediate metabolism. purified enzyme Corynebacterium glutamicum demonstrated marked sigmoidal dependence initial rate phosphoenolpyruvate concentration. presence negative allosteric effector ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate concentration half-maximum rate (S0.5) increased 1.2 2.8 mM, cooperation, expressed Hill coefficient, increased 2.0 3.2. AMP promoted opposite effects: S0.5 decreased 0.4 mM, enzyme exhibited almost cooperation. maximum reaction rate 702 U/mg, corresponded apparent kcat 2,540 s-1. enzyme influenced fructose-1,6-diphosphate used Mn2+ Co2+ cations. Sequence determination C. glutamicum pyk gene revealed open reading frame coding polypeptide 475 amino acids. information molecular mass native protein, follows pyruvate kinase tetramer 236 kDa. Comparison deduced polypeptide sequence sequences bacterial pyruvate kinases showed 39 44% homology, regions strongly conserved.
