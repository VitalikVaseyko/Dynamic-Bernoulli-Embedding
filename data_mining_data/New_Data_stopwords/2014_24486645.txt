 Fibroblasts abundant "non-cancerous" cells tumors. However, remains largely unknown cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor growth metastasis, driving chemotherapy resistance poor clinical outcome. review summarizes new findings CAF signaling pathways emerging metabolic phenotypes promote tumor growth. Although well established altered cancer metabolism enhances tumor growth, little known role fibroblast metabolism tumor growth. New studies reveal metabolic coupling occurs catabolic fibroblasts anabolic cancer cells, many types human tumors, including breast, prostate, head & neck cancers, well lymphomas. catabolic phenotypes observed CAFs secondary ROS-induced metabolic stress response. Mechanistically, occurs via HIF1-alpha NFkappaB signaling, driving oxidative stress, autophagy, glycolysis senescence stromal fibroblasts. catabolic CAFs create nutrient-rich microenvironment, metabolically support tumor growth, via local stromal generation mitochondrial fuels (lactate, ketone bodies, fatty acids, glutamine, amino acids). New biomarkers catabolic CAF phenotype (such caveolin-1 (Cav-1) MCT4), reversible upon treatment anti-oxidants, strong predictors poor clinical outcome various types human cancers. cancer cells metabolically reprogram fibroblasts also help us understand effects cancer cells organismal level, explaining para-neoplastic phenomena, cancer cachexia. conclusion, cancer viewed systemic disease, engages host-organism various forms energy-transfer metabolic co-operation, across whole-body "ecosystem".
