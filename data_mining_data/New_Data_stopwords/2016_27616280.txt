 Mycoplasma pneumoniae major cause community-acquired respiratory infections worldwide. Due strongly reduced genome, number virulence factors expressed cell wall-less pathogen limited. understand processes host colonization, investigated interactions previously confirmed surface-located glycolytic enzymes M. pneumoniae (pyruvate dehydrogenase A-C [PdhA-C], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GapA], lactate dehydrogenase [Ldh], phosphoglycerate mutase [Pgm], pyruvate kinase [Pyk] transketolase [Tkt]) human extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins fibrinogen (Fn), fibronectin (Fc), lactoferrin (Lf), laminin (Ln) vitronectin (Vc), respectively. Concentration-dependent interactions Fn Vc eight recombinant proteins derived glycolytic enzymes, Ln PdhB-C, GapA, Ldh, Pgm, Pyk Tkt, Lf PdhA-C, GapA Pyk, Fc PdhC GapA demonstrated. cases, associations significantly influenced ionic forces polyclonal sera recombinant proteins. immunoblotting, complex human plasminogen, activator (tissue-type urokinase plasminogen activator) glycolytic enzyme able degrade Fc, Lf Ln, respectively. contrast, degradation Vc confirmed presence eight enzymes tested. data suggest multifaceted associations surface-localized glycolytic enzymes play potential role adhesion invasion processes infection human respiratory mucosa M. pneumoniae.
