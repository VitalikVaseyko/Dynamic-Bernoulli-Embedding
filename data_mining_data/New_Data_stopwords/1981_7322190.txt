 influence pH activity purified pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) Trypanosoma brucei studied. Km coenzyme ADP pH-dependent shows involvement dissociable group free enzyme pKa 6.5-6.7. cooperative interaction multiple phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding sites independent pH range 5.7-7.8. Variation Vmax value pH indicates presence dissociated group (pKa 6.2-6.3) undissociated group (pKa 7.5-7.6) enzyme-substrate complex. doubly dissociated phosphate group PEP shown essential effects pH S0.5 value substrate, undissociated enzyme group pKa range 6.7-7.0. shown PEP frucotse-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) act entirely conjunction allosterically activating enzyme, FDP, heterotropic effector, decreases interaction PEP binding sites low concentration, decreases S0.5 value PEP higher concentration. model interaction enzyme substrates discussed.
