 using Western blot analysis antibodies raised recombinant pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms PDK2 PDK4, study demonstrates selective PDK isoform switching specific skeletal muscle types response high-fat feeding associated altered regulation PDK activity pyruvate. administration diet high saturated fats led stable (approximately 2-fold) increases PDK activities typical slow-twitch (soleus [SOL]) muscle typical fast-twitch (anterior tibialis [AT]) muscle. Western blot analysis revealed high-fat feeding significantly increased (approximately 2-fold; P < 0.001) PDK4 protein expression SOL, modest (1.3-fold) increase PDK2 protein expression. relative increase PDK4 protein expression SOL associated 7.6-fold increase pyruvate concentration required elicit 50% active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, indicates marked decrease sensitivity PDK inhibition pyruvate. muscle, high-fat feeding elicited comparable (1.5- 1.7-fold) increases (P < 0.05) PDK4 PDK2 protein expression. Loss sensitivity PDK inhibition pyruvate less marked. data suggest positive correlation exists increases PDK4 expression propensity muscles use lipid-derived fuels respiratory substrates rather degree insulin resistance induced skeletal muscles high-fat feeding. conclusion, high-fat feeding leads selective upregulation PDK4 expression slow-twitch muscle response high-fat feeding vivo, associated pronounced loss sensitivity PDK activity acute inhibition pyruvate. Thus, increased PDK4 expression may underlie stable modification regulatory characteristics PDK observed slow-twitch muscle response high-fat feeding.
