 Increasing evidence supports role altered mitochondrial function pathogenesis neuron degeneration Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several studies examined effect amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), activities individual proteins primary neuron cultures, studies effects Abeta mitochondrial proteome. Here, quantitatively measured changes mitochondrial proteins primary rat cortical neuron cultures exposed 25 microM Abeta(25-35) 16 h using isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) labeling 2-dimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC/MS/MS) allows simultaneous identification quantification cysteine-containing proteins. analysis enriched mitochondrial fractions identified 10 proteins including sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase, cofilin, dihydropyrimidinase, pyruvate kinase voltage dependent anion channel 1 statistically significantly (P < 0.05) altered Abeta-treated cultures. Elevations proteins associated energy production suggest cells undergoing Abeta-mediated apoptosis increase synthesis proteins essential ATP production efflux attempt maintain metabolic function.
