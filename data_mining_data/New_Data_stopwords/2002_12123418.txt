 Oxidative capacity muscles correlates capillary density microcirculation, turn depend various regulatory factors, including generated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). determine role eNOS patterns regulation energy metabolism various muscles, studied mitochondrial respiration situ saponin-permeabilized fibres well energy metabolism enzyme profile cardiac, soleus (oxidative) gastrocnemius (glycolytic) muscles isolated mice lacking eNOS (eNOS(-/-)). soleus muscle, absence eNOS induced marked decrease basal mitochondrial respiration without ADP (-32%; P <0.05) maximal respiration presence ADP (-29%; P <0.05). Furthermore, eNOS(-/-) soleus muscle showed decrease total creatine kinase (-29%; P <0.05), citrate synthase (-31%; P <0.01), adenylate kinase (-27%; P <0.05), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (-43%; P <0.01) pyruvate kinase (-26%; P <0.05) activities. percentage myosin heavy chains (slow isoform) significantly increased 24.3+/-1.5% control 30.1+/-1.1% eNOS(-/-) soleus muscle ( P <0.05) expense slight non-significant decrease three (fast) isoforms. Besides, eNOS(-/-) soleus showed 28% loss weight. Interestingly, find differences parameters cardiac gastrocnemius muscles compared respective controls. results show eNOS knockout important effect muscle oxidative capacity well activities energy metabolism enzymes oxidative (soleus) muscle. absence effects cardiac glycolytic (gastrocnemius) muscle suggests specific role eNOS-produced oxidative skeletal muscle.
