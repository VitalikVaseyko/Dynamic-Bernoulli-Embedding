 Aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known historically Warburg effect, one hallmarks cancer cells. study, characterized role BAG3 aerobic glycolysis pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) molecular mechanisms. data show aberrant expression BAG3 significantly contributes reprogramming glucose metabolism PDAC cells. Mechanistically, BAG3 increased Hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression, first key enzyme involved glycolysis, posttranscriptional level. BAG3 interacted HK2 mRNA, degree BAG3 expression altered recruitment RNA-binding proteins Roquin IMP3 HK2 mRNA. BAG3 knockdown destabilized HK2 mRNA via promotion Roquin recruitment, whereas BAG3 overexpression stabilized HK2 mRNA via promotion IMP3 recruitment. Collectively, results show BAG3 promotes reprogramming glucose metabolism via interaction HK2 mRNA PDAC cells, suggesting BAG3 may potential target aerobic glycolysis pathway developing novel anticancer agents.
