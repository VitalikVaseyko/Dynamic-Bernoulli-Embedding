 major isoform fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) initiated CUG codon, resultant product distributed nucleus/nucleolus secretory pathway. dual subcellular localization achieved part competing effects two classical intracellular targeting signals located near amino terminus. extreme amino terminus short stretch 29 amino acids signal peptide necessary translocation endoplasmic reticulum, next adjacent bipartite nuclear localization signal. carboxyl-terminal region FGF3 also implicated nuclear/nucleolar localization. describe characterization carboxyl-terminal signals showing capable directing heterologous protein, beta-galactosidase, nucleus. Furthermore, appending amino- carboxyl-terminal domains onto beta-galactosidase, reproduces dual subcellular localization properties FGF3. Nuclear uptake FGF3 appears signal-mediated since binds karyopherin alpha, nuclear localization signal binding subunit heterodimeric receptor nuclear import machinery. import FGF3 nucleus energy-dependent, inhibition process demonstrated importance nucleolar retention signal nucleoplasmic nucleolar accumulation.
