 Recent emerging biochemical data indicate several important neuroregulatory genes proteins may involved etiology schizophrenia bipolar disorder. Additionally, genes appear targets several psychotropic medications used treat disorders. Recent DNA microarray studies show genes involved synaptic neurotransmission, signal transduction, glutamate/GABA regulation may differentially regulated brains subjects schizophrenia. hypothesized chronic administration olanzapine rats would alter expression various genes may involved etiology schizophrenia mood disorders. Rats administered olanzapine (N=20, 2 mg/kg/day) sterile saline intraperitoneally (N=20) daily 21 days. Control olanzapine-treated frontal cortices analyzed using cDNA microarray technology. results showed significant downregulation 31 genes upregulation 38 genes greater two-fold drug-treated brains vs controls. results provide evidence altered regulation genes involved signal transduction cell communication, metabolism energy pathways, transport, immune response, nucleic acid metabolism, neuronal growth factors. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis verified direction magnitude change six genes interest: calbindin 3, homer 1, regulator G-protein signaling (RGS) 2, pyruvate kinase, Reelin insulin 2. Western blotting showed significant upregulation protein products Reelin 410 Reelin 180 kDa downregulation NMDA3B RGS2. results show first time olanzapine causes changes levels several important genes may involved etiology treatment schizophrenia psychiatric disorders.
