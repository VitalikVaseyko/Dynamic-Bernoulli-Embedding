 biguanide metformin, widely used drug treatment type 2 diabetes, may exert cancer chemopreventive effects suppressing transformative hyperproliferative processes initiate carcinogenesis. Metformin's molecular targets cancer cells (e.g., mTOR, HER2) similar currently used directed cancer therapy. However, metformin nontoxic might extremely useful enhancing treatment efficacy mechanism-based biologically targeted drugs. Here, first revisit epidemiological, preclinical, clinical evidence last 5 years showing metformin promising candidate oncology therapeutics. Second, anticancer effects metformin direct (insulin-independent) indirect (insulin-dependent) mechanisms discussed terms metformin-targeted processes ontogenesis cancer stem cells (CSC), including Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) microRNAs-regulated dedifferentiation CSCs. Finally, present preliminary evidence metformin may regulate cellular senescence, innate safeguard cellular immortalization. two main lines evidence suggest metformin's primary target immortalizing step tumorigenesis. First, metformin activates intracellular DNA damage response checkpoints. Second, metformin attenuates anti-senescence effects ATP-generating glycolytic metabotype-the Warburg effect-, required self-renewal proliferation CSCs. metformin therapy presents intrinsic barrier tumorigenesis lowering threshold stress-induced senescence, metformin therapeutic strategies may pivotal therapeutic intervention cancer. Current future clinical trials elucidate whether metformin potential used preventive treatment settings adjuvant current cancer therapeutics.
