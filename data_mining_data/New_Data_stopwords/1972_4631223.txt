 1. Two forms hepatic pyruvate kinase, designated type L type M, distinguished basis kinetic, chromatographic, electrophoretic immunological criteria. partially purified properties compared purified enzyme skeletal muscle. 2. contrast type L, type enzyme showed marked evidence co-operative interactions phosphoenolpyruvate stimulated fructose diphosphate. 3. activity profiles type L type enzymes determined developing rat liver utilizing differences kinetic properties two forms. high activity type enzyme early foetal rat decreased late gestation immediately birth reach low value, remained essentially constant remainder developmental period. activity type L enzyme, contrast, low early foetal neonatal liver increased markedly onset weaning. 4. Possible roles two forms hepatic pyruvate kinase control glycolysis gluconeogenesis discussed.
