 Cytosolic pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) important glycolytic enzyme, post-translational regulation enzyme poorly understood. Sequence analysis soybean seed enzyme suggested potential two phosphorylation sites: site-1 (FVRKGS220DLVN) site-2 (VLTRGGS407TAKL). Sequence- phosphorylation state-specific antipeptide antibodies established cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PyrKinc) phosphorylated sites vivo. However, SDS-PAGE, phosphorylated polypeptides found smaller (20-51 kDa) full length (55 kDa). Biochemical separations seed proteins size exclusion chromatography sucrose-density gradient centrifugation revealed phosphorylated polypeptides associated 26S proteasomes. 26S proteasome particle developing seeds determined approximately 1900 kDa. vitro, 26S proteasome degraded associated PyrKinc polypeptides, blocked proteasome-specific inhibitors MG132 NLVS. immunoprecipitation, found part phosphorylated PyrKinc conjugated ubiquitin shifted high molecular mass forms vivo. Moreover, recombinant wild-type PyrKinc ubiquitinated vitro much greater extent S220A S407A mutant proteins, suggesting link phosphorylation ubiquitination. addition, seed development, progressive accumulation C-terminally truncated polypeptide approximately 51 kDa observed parallel loss full-length 55 kDa polypeptide. Interestingly, C-terminal 51 kDa truncation showed pyruvate kinase activity also activation aspartate. Collectively, results suggest two pathways PyrKinc modification post-translational level. One involves partial C-terminal truncation generate 51 kDa pyruvate kinase subunit might altered regulatory properties involves phosphorylation ubiquitin conjugation targets protein 26S proteasome complete degradation.
