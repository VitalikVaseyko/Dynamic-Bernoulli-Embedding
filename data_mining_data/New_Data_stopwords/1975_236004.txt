 studies mechanism inhibitory effect 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate glycolysis human erythrocytes, following results obtained: 1) Glucose consumption lactate production reduced 70 40 per cent relative normal erythrocytes red blood cells containing five times normal amount 2, 3, -P2-glycerate ("high-diphosphoglycerate" cells) extracellular pH 7.4. marked dependency glycolysis extracellular pH observed normal erythrocytes almost completely lost "high-diphosphoglycerate" cells. 2) 50 per cent inhibition glycolysis "high-diphosphoglycerate" cells accounted 2, 3-P2-glycerate-induced decrease red-cell pH. fall red-cell pH occurs conswquence Donnan effect non-pentrating 2, 3-P2-glycerate anion leads reduction glycolytic rate due properties enzyme phosphofructokinase. 3) remaining part inhibitory effect must attributed inhibition 2, 3-P2-glycerate glycolytic enzymes. measurements glycolytic rates concentrations glycolytic intermediates absence presence methylene blue concluded hexokinase reaction inhibited elevation 2, 3-P2-glycerate concentration "high-diphosphoglycerate" cells suggests also enzyme pyruvate kinase inhibited 2, 3-P2-glycerate. 4) dependencies net-change 2, 3-P2-glycerate concentration red-cell pH identical normal "high-diphosphoglycerate" cells indicating balance formation decomposition 2, 3-P2-glycerate erythrocytes normal high compositions 2, 3-P2-glycerate.
