 method isolating pure reticulocytes leukocyte-depleted blood normal persons presented. separation achieved using immunomagnetic technique. monoclonal mouse antibody human transferrin receptor bound magnetic beads conjugated sheep antimouse antibody. recovery reticulocytes peripheral blood 15% 42%. Blood used isolation reticulocytes could stored 4 days 22 degrees C without altering yield reticulocytes. 37 degrees C incubation, reticulocytes matured rapidly transferrin receptor found half-life 16 hours. activity several enzymes amount creatine hemoglobin A1C measured reticulocytes peripheral blood. enzymes, porphobilinogen deaminase best discriminatory power ratio 8.8 reticulocytes peripheral red blood cells. ratio creatine 16.7. ability isolate pure human reticulocytes, released normal erythropoiesis, offer new possibilities study cells.
