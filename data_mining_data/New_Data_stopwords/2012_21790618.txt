 simple rapid method using coupled bioluminescent assay developed determine level ADP. ADP involved many biological reactions ADP assay used assaying reactions universally monitoring ADP formation depletion. ADP analysis involves incubation ADP extracts containing ADP pyruvate kinase (PK) PEP. ATP formed reaction determined measuring intensity initial light flash produced luciferin-luciferase preparation injected reaction mixture. regard main role PK assay, gene PK Geobacillus species cloned expression vector pET28a (+), sequenced overexpressed Escherichia coli. Recombinant protein purified using Ni-NTA column purified PK used coupled bioluminescent assay ADP measurement. Kinetic properties PK determined according bioluminescent assay using firefly luciferase.
