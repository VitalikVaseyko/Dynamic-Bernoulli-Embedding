 recovery glycogen-depleting exercise, shift carbohydrate oxidation glycogen resynthesis. activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex may decrease reduce oxidation carbohydrates favor increasing gluconeogenic recycling carbohydrate-derived substrates process. precise mechanism behind yet elucidated; however, research examining mRNA content suggested less-abundant pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) may reduce PDH activation exercise recovery. investigate this, skeletal muscle liver wild-type (WT) PDK4-knockout (PDK4-KO) mice analyzed rest (Rest), exercise exhaustion (Exh), 2 h recovery ad libitum feeding (Rec). Although differences exercise tolerance genotypes, caloric consumption doubled PDK4-KO mice Rec. this, PDK4-KO mice Rec supercompensated muscle glycogen 120% resting stores. Therefore, extra group PDK4-KO mice pair-fed (PF) WT mice Rec comparison. PF mice fully replenished muscle glycogen recovered 50% liver glycogen stores. Concentrations muscle lactate alanine also lower PF WT mice, indicating decrease may lead potential reduction recycled gluconeogenic substrates, due oxidation carbohydrate precursors skeletal muscle, leading observed reductions hepatic glucose glycogen concentrations. impairments seen PF PDK4-KO mice, results suggest role PDK4 regulating PDH complex muscle promoting gluconeogenic precursor recirculation recovery exhaustive exercise.
