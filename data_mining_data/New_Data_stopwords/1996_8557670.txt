 conserve carbohydrate reserves, reaction pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) must down-regulated citric acid cycle provided sufficient acetyl-CoA. PDC activity reduced primarily increased phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component due E1 kinase activity markedly enhanced elevated intramitochondrial NADH:NAD+ acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios. mechanism evaluated enhanced kinase activity facilitated build-up reduced acetylated forms lipoyl moieties dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component using NADH acetyl-CoA reverse downstream reactions complex. Using peptide substrate, kinase activity stimulated products, ruling possibility kinase activity increased due changes reaction state substrate, E1 (thiamin pyrophosphate). E2 subunit contains two lipoyl domains, NH2-terminal (L1) inward lipoyl domain (L2), individually produced fully lipoylated forms recombinant techniques. Although reduction acetylation L1 domain free lipoamide increased kinase activity, modifications lipoate kinase-binding L2 domain gave much greater enhancements kinase activity. large stimulation kinase generated acetyl-CoA occurred upon addition transacetylase-catalyzing (lipoyl domain-free) inner core portion E2 plus reduced lipoate source, affirming acetylation prosthetic group essential mechanistic step acetyl-CoA enhancing kinase activity. Similarly, lesser stimulation kinase activity NADH required lipoate source, supporting need lipoate reduction E3 catalysis. Complete enzymatic delipoylation PDC, E2-kinase subcomplex, recombinant L2 abolished stimulatory effects NADH acetyl-CoA. Retention small portion PDC lipoates lowered kinase activity allowed stimulation residual kinase activity products. Reintroduction lipoyl moieties, using lipoyl protein ligase, restored capacity E2 core support high kinase activity along stimulation activity 3-fold NADH acetyl-CoA. suggested results, enhancement kinase activity responsive reductive acetylation half-maximal stimulation achieved approximately 20% free L2 acetylated and, analysis previous results, acetylation 3-6 60 L2 domains intact PDC. Based findings, suggest kinase stimulation results modification lipoate L2 domain becomes specifically engaged binding kinase. conclusion, kinase activity attenuated substantial range response modest changes proportion oxidized, reduced, acetylated lipoyl moieties L2 domain E2 produced fluctuations NADH:NAD+ acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios translated rapid reversible E3 E2 reactions.
