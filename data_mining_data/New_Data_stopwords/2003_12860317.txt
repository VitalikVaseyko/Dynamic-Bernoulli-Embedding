 present study reports antioxidant activity Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), family Elaegnaceae, chromium induced oxidative stress male albino rats. Oxidative stress induced rats force-feeding potassium dichromate equivalent dose 30mg/kg body weight (BW) chromium(VI) 30 days. Administration chromium decreased body weight increased organ body weight ratio significantly. Chromium treatment significantly decreased reduced glutathione (GSH), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels; also enhanced glutamate oxaloacetate transferase (GOT) glutamate pyruvate transferase (GPT) levels serum. Different doses alcoholic leaf extract Seabuckthorn evaluated protection chromium induced oxidative stress. results show leaf extract concentration 100 250mg/kg BW protected animals chromium induced oxidative injury significantly.
