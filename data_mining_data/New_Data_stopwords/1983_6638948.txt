 possibility alterations metabolism glucose small intestine C57BL/6J (ob/ob) obese-diabetic mice investigated. Glucose metabolism assessed direct measurement vitro, assaying activities glycolytic pentose phosphate pathway enzymes. small intestine 3-week-old obese mice exhibited reduced glucose metabolism hexokinase activity comparison lean controls. adult animals little evidence effect hyperphagia hyperinsulinaemia metabolism glucose supplied lumen, except elevated pyruvate kinase activity intestinal mucosa 20-week-old obese mice might consequence hyperinsulinaemia.
