 Glycolysis, central metabolic pathway, harbors evolutionary conserved enzymes modulate potentially shift cellular metabolism requirement. Pyruvate kinase, catalyzes last rate-limiting step glycolysis, expressed four isozymic forms, depending tissue requirement. M2 isoform (PKM2) exclusively expressed embryonic adult dividing/tumor cells. tetrameric allosterically regulated isoform intrinsically designed downregulate activity subunit dissociation (into dimer), results partial inhibition glycolysis last step. accumulates upstream glycolytic intermediates anabolic feed synthesis lipids nucleic acids, whereas reassociation PKM2 active tetramer replenishes normal catabolism feedback cell division. addition, involvement enzyme variety pathways, protein-protein interactions, nuclear transport suggests potential perform multiple nonglycolytic functions diverse implications, although multidimensional role protein yet fully explored. review aims provide overview involvement PKM2 various physiological pathways possible functional implications.
