 Inhibitory effect Zn pyruvate kinase (muscle)-type isozyme analyzed purpose elucidating cytotoxicity Zn. Zn inhibited pyruvate kinase uncompetitively respect substrate PEP, competitively respect ADP. Quotient velocity plot calculated Zn-inhibition curves showed Zn(2+) ZnADP complex acted competitive uncompetitive inhibitors enzyme respect substrate ADP PEP, respectively: Zn(2+) forms ZnADP complex, may bind ADP-binding site free enzyme Ki value 1.4 muM causing competitive inhibition, ADP-site enzyme-PEP complex 2.6 muM resulting uncompetitive inhibition. inhibition pyruvate kinase Zn(2+) may responsible cytotoxicity metal decreasing glycolytic flux.
