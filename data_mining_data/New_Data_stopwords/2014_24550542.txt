 Adaptor proteins link surface receptors intracellular signaling pathways potentially control way cells respond nutrient availability. Mice deficient p66Shc, recently evolved isoform Shc1 adaptor proteins mediator receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, display resistance diabetes obesity. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, found p66Shc inhibited glucose metabolism. Depletion p66Shc enhanced glycolysis increased allocation glucose-derived carbon anabolic metabolism, characteristics metabolic shift called Warburg effect. change metabolism mediated mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition mTOR rapamycin reversed glycolytic phenotype caused p66Shc deficiency. Thus, unlike isoforms Shc1, p66Shc appears antagonize insulin mTOR signaling, limits glucose uptake metabolism. results identify critical inhibitory role p66Shc anabolic metabolism.
