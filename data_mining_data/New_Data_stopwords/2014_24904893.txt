 Metabolic aberrations form altered flux key metabolic pathways major hallmarks several life-threatening malignancies including malignant gliomas. adaptations play important role enhancement survival proliferation gliomas expense surrounding normal/healthy tissues. Recent studies field neurooncology directly targeted altered metabolic pathways malignant tumor cells development anti-cancer drugs. Aerobic glycolysis due elevated production lactate pyruvate regardless oxygen availability common metabolic alteration malignancies. Aerobic glycolysis offers survival advantages addition generating substrates fatty acids, amino acids nucleotides required rapid proliferation cells. review outlines role pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) gliomas inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate. in-depth investigation key metabolic enzyme PDK may provide novel therapeutic approach treatment malignant gliomas.
