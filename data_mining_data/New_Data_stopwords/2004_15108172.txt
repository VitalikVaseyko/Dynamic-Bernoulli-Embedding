 Observations impaired glucose regulation schizophrenia long-standing, although pathological etiological significance uncertain. One approach issue minimizes environmental variables (e.g., medication diet) determine whether genes related glucose regulation show genetic linkage schizophrenia. examined potential role glucose metabolism schizophrenia genome scan affection status schizophrenia empirical method deriving P-values. Data utilized NIMH Genetics Initiative Schizophrenia dataset, comprises total sample consisting 71 pedigrees containing 218 nuclear families 987 individuals. genome scan 459 markers spaced average 10 cM intervals conducted using linkage analysis program Genehunter separately European- African-American groups. Enzymes regulate glycolysis identified genes regulating enzymes located Online Mendelian Inheritance Man (OMIM) website. focus study genes located near previously reported schizophrenia susceptibility regions. genome-wide significance genes schizophrenia assessed using permutation testing. results adjusted multiple testing within across ethnic groups, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2; chromosome 1q32.2) achieved genome-wide significance (P = 0.04). addition, hexokinase 3 (HK3; chromosome 5q35.3) also suggestive linkage (P = 0.09). European-American sample, PFKFB2 (1q32.2), hexokinase 3 (HK3; 5q35.3), pyruvate kinase 3 (PK3; chromosome 15q23) achieved significance 0.05 level. None genes showed significance African-American sample. results provide support view genes regulate glucose metabolism may also influence susceptibility schizophrenia. generally, support view relationships glucose dysregulation schizophrenia inherent disorder, merely epiphenomena related medication treatment factors.
