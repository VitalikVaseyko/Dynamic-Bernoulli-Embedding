 Butyrate, short-chain fatty acid produced colonic bacterial fermentation able induce cell growth inhibition differentiation colon cancer cells least partially capacity inhibit histone deacetylases. Since butyrate expected impact cellular metabolic pathways colon cancer cells, hypothesize could exert antiproliferative properties altering cellular metabolism. show although Caco2 colon cancer cells oxidized butyrate glucose CO(2) , displayed higher oxidation rate butyrate substrate glucose. Furthermore, butyrate pretreatment led increase cell capacity oxidize butyrate decreased capacity oxidize glucose, suggesting colon cancer cells, initially highly glycolytic, switch butyrate utilizing phenotype, preferentially oxidize butyrate instead glucose energy source produce acetyl coA. Butyrate pretreated cells displayed modulation glutamine metabolism characterized increased incorporation carbons derived glutamine lipids reduced lactate production. butyrate-stimulated glutamine utilization linked pyruvate dehydrogenase complex since dichloroacetate reverses effect. Furthermore, butyrate positively regulates gene expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases effect involves hyperacetylation histones PDK4 gene promoter level. data suggest butyrate exerts two distinct effects ensure regulation glutamine metabolism: provides acetyl coA needed fatty acid synthesis, also plays role control expression genes involved glucose utilization leading inactivation PDC.
