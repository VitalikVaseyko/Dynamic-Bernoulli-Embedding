 developed vitro model human papillary collecting duct cells isolated cadaver kidneys using methods similar previously reported isolation human proximal tubule cells. date isolated papillary collecting duct cells 100 normal human kidneys. Papillae dissected digested Cellgro containing 400 U/ml collagenase. Cells plated fibronectin-coated culture flasks density 10(4) live cells/ml Cellgro supplemented insulin 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent monolayers, able withstand 600 mOSM 8 h, obtained within 10 15 d. Cells primary isolates first passages exhibited epithelial cell ultrastructure including cell junctions, microvilli, cilia. dark-brown reaction product observed cells stained immunoperoxidase method peroxidase-labeled peanut lectin (Arachis hypogaea), binds specifically human distal tubule collecting duct cells. cells negative Factor-VIII (a marker endothelial cells) gamma-glutamyltransferase (a marker proximal tubule cells). High activities glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase arginine vasopressin-stimulated cAMP production cells consistent distal nephron origin. results indicate human collecting duct cells isolated cultured provide vitro system probe pathogenetic mechanisms potential nephrotoxins.
