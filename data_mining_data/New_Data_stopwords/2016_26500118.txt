 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) essential enzyme involved regulation aerobic glycolysis cancer cells promotes translation glycolytic flux biosynthesis cellular building blocks. AIM: present study aims explore expression pattern underlying cellular functions PKM2 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) metabolic stress. METHODS: Oncomine database tissue microarray (n = 90) used investigate expression pattern PKM2 clinicopathological findings. vitro proliferation, apoptosis invasion assays used determine role related mechanism PKM2 PDAC. RESULTS: Data Oncomine database tissue microarray show PKM2 significantly elevated PDAC specimens compared corresponding normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis shows higher expression PKM2 closely correlated poor prognosis patients PDAC. metabolic stress, suppression PKM2 expression PANC-1 AsPC-1 cells results decreased cell survival, increased caspase-3/7 activity, reduced invasive potential, effects reversed reintroduction PKM2. Furthermore, sh-PKM2 cells show significant decreased Warburg effect compared sh-Ctrl cells demonstrated reduced glucose consumption lactate production. Treatment 2-deoxy-D-glucose, glycolysis inhibitor, completely blocks influences PKM2 cell survival invasion. CONCLUSIONS: study reveals silencing PKM2 exhibits tumor-suppressive role altered Warburg effect suggests targeting PKM2 might serve potential therapeutic target PDAC.
