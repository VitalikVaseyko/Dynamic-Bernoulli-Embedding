 Despite ongoing high energetic demands, brains always use glucose oxygen ratio produces maximal ATP oxidative phosphorylation. cases glucose consumption exceeds oxygen use despite adequate oxygen availability, phenomenon known aerobic glycolysis. Although metabolic plasticity seems essential normal cognition, studying functional significance challenging experimental systems link brain metabolic patterns distinct behavioral states. recent transcriptomic analysis established correlation aggression decreased whole-brain oxidative phosphorylation activity honey bee (Apis mellifera), suggesting brain metabolic plasticity may modulate naturally occurring behavior. demonstrate relationship brain metabolism aggression causal, conserved evolutionary time, cell type-specific, modulated social environment. Pharmacologically treating honey bees inhibit complexes V oxidative phosphorylation pathway resulted increased aggression. addition, transgenic RNAi lines genetic manipulation knock gene expression complex fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) neurons resulted increased aggression, knockdown glia effect. Finally, honey bee colony-level social manipulations decrease individual aggression attenuated effects oxidative phosphorylation inhibition aggression, demonstrating specific effect social environment brain function. decreased neuronal oxidative phosphorylation usually associated brain disease, findings provide powerful context understanding brain metabolic plasticity naturally occurring behavioral plasticity.
