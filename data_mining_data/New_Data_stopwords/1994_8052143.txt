 signal transduction pathway involved activation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) insulin still unknown. study, examined possible involvement protein kinase C (PKC) process. addressing question, examined (1) insulin-like effects PKC activator 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) PDH complex, (2) effects various PKC inhibitors PDH activation insulin, (3) response PKC-depleted cells insulin. used experimental model Zajdela hepatoma cultured (ZHC) cells, demonstrated responsive physiological doses insulin. Half-maximal maximal stimulations PDH complex insulin observed 0.05 5 nmol/L, respectively. Stimulation PDH activity insulin (5 nmol/L) occurred within 5 minutes incubation maximal (+70%) 7.5 minutes. presence PMA (162 nmol/L), enzyme activity increased within 30 seconds, maximal (+90%) 5 minutes, longer detectable 10 minutes. Total PDH activity unchanged insulin PMA treatment. effects PMA insulin basal PDH activity additive. Moreover, various inhibitors PKC--staurosporine, sphingosine, acridine orange--completely blocked stimulation PDH activity induced insulin PMA. 17-hour treatment ZHC cells 500 nmol/L PMA efficiently downregulated PKC, attested marked decrease enzyme activity loss phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding intact cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
