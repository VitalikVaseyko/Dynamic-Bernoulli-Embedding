 Cystinosis metabolic disturb associated excessive lysosomal cystine accumulation secondary defective cystine efflux. Patients affected disease develop variable degree symptoms depending involved tissues. Accumulation cystine brain may lead severe neurological symptoms. However, mechanisms cystine neurotoxic fully understood. Considering pyruvate kinase (PK) thiolic enzyme crucial glycolytic pathway, disulfides like cystine may alter thiolic enzymes thiol/disulfide exchange, main objective present study investigate effect cystine PK activity brain cortex developing Wistar rats. also performed kinetic studies investigated effects GSH, biologically occurring thiol groups protector, cysteamine (CysN), drug used cystinosis treatment, enzyme activity. observed cystine inhibited enzyme activity two different mechanisms, one competition ADP phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), non-competitively, probably oxidation thiol groups PK. also observed GSH cysteamine fully prevented reversed inhibition caused cystine. Considering cysteamine used patients cystinosis causes parenkimal organ cystine depletion, present data provides possible new beneficial effect use drug.
