 M2 isoform pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) shown up-regulated human skin cancers. test whether PKM2 may target chemoprevention, shikonin, natural product root Lithospermum erythrorhizon specific inhibitor PKM2, used chemically-induced mouse skin carcinogenesis study. results revealed shikonin treatment suppressed skin tumor formation. Morphological examinations immunohistochemical staining skin epidermal tissues suggested shikonin inhibited cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis. Although shikonin alone suppressed PKM2 activity, suppress tumor promoter-induced PKM2 activation skin epidermal tissues end skin carcinogenesis study. reveal potential chemopreventive mechanism shikonin, antibody microarray analysis performed, results showed transcription factor ATF2 downstream target Cdk4 up-regulated chemical carcinogen treatment; whereas up-regulations suppressed shikonin. promotable skin cell model, nuclear levels ATF2 increased tumor promotion, whereas increase inhibited shikonin. Furthermore, knockdown ATF2 decreased expression levels Cdk4 Fra-1 (a key subunit activator protein 1. summary, results suggest shikonin, rather inhibiting PKM2 vivo, suppresses ATF2 pathway skin carcinogenesis.
