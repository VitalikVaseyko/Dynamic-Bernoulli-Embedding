 Periportal perivenous hepatocytes isolated rat liver digitonin/collagenase perfusion investigating acinar heterogeneity amino acid transport activities related glutamine ammonia metabolism. Immunocytochemical staining respective subpopulations glutamine synthetase demonstrated periportal subpopulations essentially free glutamine synthetase-positive cells, whereas perivenous subpopulations showed 2- 3-fold enrichment glutamine synthetase-positive hepatocytes. high perivenous/periportal ratio 59 found glutamine synthetase activity well perivenous/periportal ratios marker enzymes indicated good separation periportal perivenous cells. alpha-Aminoisobutyric acid, histidine glutamate used determine distribution pattern amino acid transport systems A, N G-, well sodium-independent uptake compounds 1 hr isolation maximal hormonal stimulation primary culture. strong heterogeneity sodium-independent transport histidine, characterized higher perivenous transport rates [perivenous/periportal ratio: 1.5 (1 hr) 3.5 (48 hr)], suggests significant role facilitated diffusion, presumably glutamine export. Conversely, strong heterogeneity sodium-dependent glutamate transport (System G-) characterized higher uptake rates nonstimulated [perivenous/periportal ratio: 6.6 (1 hr)] hormonally treated perivenous hepatocytes (perivenous/periportal ratio: 2.2) reflects possible significance respect substrate availability glutamine synthesis. observed heterogeneities provide basis understanding substrate fluxes related glutamine metabolism might established regulated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
