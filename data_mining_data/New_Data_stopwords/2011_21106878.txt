 Bacterial infection decreases skeletal muscle protein synthesis via inhibition mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), key regulator translation initiation. better define mechanism muscle mTOR activity decreased, used vitro model C2C12 myotubes treated endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]and interferon (IFN)-gamma determine whether stable lipophilic pyruvate derivatives restore mTOR signaling. Myotubes treated combination LPS IFNgamma down-regulated phosphorylation mTOR substrates S6 kinase-1 4E binding protein-1. phosphorylation ribosomal protein S6 decreased, whereas phosphorylation elongation factor-2 enhanced; results consistent defects translation initiation elongation. LPS/IFNgamma decreased protein synthesis 60% myotubes. Treatment methyl ethyl pyruvate partially protected LPS/IFNgamma-induced fall mTOR signaling. protective effect ethyl methyl pyruvate could replicated equimolar amount sodium pyruvate. Although LPS/IFNgamma treated myotubes initially IGF-I responsive, prolonged exposure (>/= 17 h) resulted IGF-I resistance level mTOR despite normal IGF-I receptor phosphorylation. Ethyl pyruvate treatment restored IGF-I sensitivity evidenced left shift IGF-I dose-response curve maintained IGF-I responsiveness prolonged period time. Ethyl pyruvate also restored IGF-I-stimulated protein synthesis LPS/IFNgamma-treated myotubes. Cotreatment N-acetyl cysteine ascorbic acid also preserved IGF-I sensitivity mTOR activity. data suggest combination LPS IFNgamma inhibits mTOR activity prolonged exposure induces IGF-I resistance myotubes. Lipophilic pyruvate derivatives antioxidants show promise rescuing mTOR activity muscle protein synthesis maintaining IGF-I sensitivity model.
