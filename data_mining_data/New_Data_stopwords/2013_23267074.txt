 Many cancer cells increased rates aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon termed Warburg effect. addition, tumors predominance expression M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2). M2 expression previously shown necessary aerobic glycolysis provide growth advantage tumors. report knockdown pyruvate kinase tumor cells leads decrease levels pyruvate kinase activity increase pyruvate kinase substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. However, lactate production glucose, although reduced, fully inhibited. Furthermore, unique reporting increased serine glycine biosynthesis glucose glutamine following pyruvate kinase knockdown. Although pyruvate kinase knockdown results modest impairment proliferation vitro, vivo growth established xenograft tumors unaffected PKM2 absence. findings indicate PKM2 dispensable tumor maintenance growth vivo, suggesting metabolic pathways bypass function.
