 PURPOSE: Metabolic adaptations, increases glucose energy metabolism, play pivotal role biology RCC. PDK-1 DJ-1/PARK7 thought control metabolic pathways cancer. investigated expression PDK-1 DJ-1/PARK7 RCC prognostic relevance. METHODS: RCC tumor tissue corresponding normal parenchyma samples obtained 91 patients clear cell RCC. Expression PDK-1 DJ-1/PARK7 determined mRNA protein levels using quantitative RT-PCR immunohistochemistry. Expression ratios tumor/normal analyzed associations pathological stage grade (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, chi-square test). Potential associations progression-free overall survival analyzed using Cox regression models. RESULTS: PDK-1 mRNA expression up-regulated compared normal tissue (p < 0.001). Differences observed tumor stage (p < 0.05) trend toward lower expression increasing stage (p > 0.01). Expression ratio tumor/normal also showed differences tumor stage lowest ratio observed advanced (pT3) disease. MRNA expression data confirmed protein level lowest protein expression pT3 tumors. PDK-1 expression ratio tumor/normal inversely associated outcome adjustment stage grade (HR, 0.54; 95 % CI, 0.31-0.94). associations observed DJ-1/PARK7 expression. CONCLUSIONS: PDK up-regulated RCC, down-regulation may associated progression toward metastasizing behavior. Given role PDK-1 control glucose metabolism, aerobic glycolysis via up-regulation PDK-1 may early event RCC development, less relevant progression toward aggressive phenotype.
