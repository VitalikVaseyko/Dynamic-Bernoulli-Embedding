 Intact ejaculated bovine sperm incorporate 32Pi ADP specific activity two three times higher ATP. contrasts cell types ATP specific activity higher ADP. Predominant labeling ADP may partially due compartmentation ATP, removal cytosolic ATP change relative labeling ADP ATP. Dilution extracellular 32Pi following labeling resulted loss 70% label ADP 50% loss gamma-ATP 26 min. ADP labeled absence detectable ATP presence rotenone plus antimycin. Fractionation ejaculated sperm yielded midpieces depleted adenylate kinase coupled respiration. ATP labeled 32Pi, ADP midpieces. Evidence mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation-supported incorporation 32Pi nucleotides observed intact sperm incubated pyruvate inhibitors oxidative phosphorylation, activity occur midpieces appear explain disproportionate labeling ADP. conclude labeling ADP intact permeabilized cells occurs two pathways; one involves adenylate kinase, unknown pathway may independent ATP.
