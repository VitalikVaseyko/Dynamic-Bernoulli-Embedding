 BACKGROUND PURPOSE: metabolic switch aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) enhanced lactate production characteristic aggressive tumor cells co-determining factor tumor response treatment outcome. Thus analysis metabolic status treatment important understand improve treatment modalities. MATERIALS METHODS: Metabolite concentrations determined immersion tumor sections ATP, lactate glucose-depending luciferase-containing buffer system. Integrated light output detected bioluminescent detection system. RESULTS: Mice carrying tumor xenografts derived A549 lung cancer cells treated microtubule stabilizing agent patupilone, ionizing radiation combination. Lactate levels significantly reduced glucose levels drastically increased comparison untreated tumors. Interestingly, changes minimal tumors derived patupilone-resistant otherwise isogenic A549EpoB40 cells. ATP levels tumors tested change treatment. compared histological endpoints, basal treatment-dependent changes lactate levels different tumors mainly correlated proliferative activity tumor growth response treatment. CONCLUSIONS: study shows tumor metabolism responsive different treatment modalities could eventually used early surrogate marker treatment response.
