 Epidemiological data demonstrated inverse association serum vitamin D3 levels, cancer incidence related mortality. However, effects vitamin prostate cancer biology utility prevention prostate cancer progression well-defined. data often conflicting: reports suggest vitamin D3 induces apoptosis androgen dependent prostate cancer cell lines, others suggest vitamin D3 induces cell cycle arrest. Recent molecular studies identified extensive synergistic crosstalk vitamin D- androgen-mediated mRNA miRNA expression, adding additional layer post-transcriptional regulation known VDR- AR-regulated gene activation. Warburg effect, inefficient metabolic pathway converts glucose lactate rapid energy generation, phenomenon common many different types cancer. process supports cell proliferation promotes cancer progression via alteration glucose, glutamine lipid metabolism. Prostate cancer notable exception general process since metabolic switch occurs early malignancy reverse Warburg effect. "anti-Warburg effect" due unique biology normal prostate cells harbor truncated TCA cycle required produce secret citrate. prostate cancer cells, TCA cycle activity restored citrate oxidation used produce energy cancer cell proliferation. 1,25(OH)2D3 androgen together modulates TCA cycle via transcriptional regulation zinc transporters, suggesting 1,25(OH)2D3 androgen maintain normal prostate metabolism blocking citrate oxidation. data demonstrate importance androgens anti-proliferative effect vitamin prostate cancer highlight importance understanding crosstalk two signaling pathways.
