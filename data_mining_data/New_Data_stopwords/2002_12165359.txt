 Evidence rats flown space suggests decrease ability soleus muscle oxidize long chain fatty acids space flight. observation suggests shift pathways involved muscle fuel utilization absence load muscle occurred. also possible reduction part general down-sizing metabolic capacity since energy needs inactive muscle necessarily less. rodent hind limb suspension model proved useful ground based model studying musculo-skeletal systems changes occur space flight. Microarray technology permits screening large number enzymes relevant pathways thereby permitting distinction made shift fuel utilization pattern general decrease metabolic activity. soleus muscle isolated 5 control 5 hindlimb suspended rats (21 days) Affymetrix system assessing gene expression used determine impact hindlimb unloading fuel pathways within muscle animal. RESULTS: Suspended rats failed gain weight rate controls (337 +/- 5 g vs 318 +/- 6 g, p < 0.05) muscle mass soleus reduced (135 +/- 3 mg vs 48 +/- 4 mg, p < 0.05). consistent decrease (p < 0.05) gene expression proteins involved fatty acid oxidation suspended group whereas glycolytic activity increased (p < 0.05). Gene expressions individual key regulatory enzymes reflected changes. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II decreased (p < 0.05) whereas expression hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase increased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Disuse atrophy associated change mRNA levels enzymes involved fuel metabolism indicative shift substrate utilization away fat towards glucose.
