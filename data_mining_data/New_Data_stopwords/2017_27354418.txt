 Siblings presented neonates severe jaundice transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia. Next-generation sequencing revealed three heterozygous mutations gene encoding erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PKLR), plus heterozygous splice mutation beta-spectrin gene (SPTB). addition, different 5th mutation gene encoding erythrocyte membrane proteins. asymptomatic parents three asymptomatic siblings different sets mutations.
