 work initiated determine whether toxicity generated inhibition mitochondrial fuel metabolism similar high glucose/palmitate (HG/PA)-induced glucolipotoxicity. Influx glucose free fatty acids tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle inhibited treatment pyruvate carboxylase (PC) inhibitor phenylacetic acid (PAA) carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) inhibitor etomoxir (Eto), knockdown PC CPT-1. Treatment PAA/Eto knockdown PC/CPT-1 induced apoptotic death INS-1 beta cells. Similar HG/PA treatment, PAA/Eto increased endoplasmic reticulum stress responses decreased Akt signal. JNK inhibitor chemical chaperone protective PAA/Eto- HG/PA-induced cell death. attempts reduce [Ca(2)(+)](i), stimulate lipid metabolism, increase TCA cycle intermediate pool protected PAA/Eto-induced death well HG/PA-induced death. data suggest signals induced impaired mitochondrial fuel metabolism play critical role HG/PA-induced glucolipotoxicity.
