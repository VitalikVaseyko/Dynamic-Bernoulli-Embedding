 Cancer cells metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Fang et al. (2010) show endoplasmic reticulum enzyme ENTPD5 promotes ATP consumption favors aerobic glycolysis. findings suggest nutrient uptake cancer cells limited ATP satisfies energy requirements ATP production.
