 study tested hypothesis 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays role regulating aspects metabolism IMR-90 normal human fetal lung fibroblasts. Among enzymes studied, pyruvate kinase showed significant increase treatment confluent-phase cells 1,25(OH)2D3 various concentrations (0.1-100 nM range) 24 h. parallel increase lactate output observed. Steroid specificity established failure 10 nM levels 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, estradiol-17 beta progesterone affect pyruvate kinase activity. determination time course [3H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose transport indicated hormone influence transmembrane transport system D-glucose. addition inhibitors cycloheximide actinomycin culture medium abolished, least part, 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation pyruvate kinase activity, suggesting probable dependence hormone effect cellular RNA protein synthesis. 1,25(OH)2D3 also affected fibroblast growth DNA synthesis. Cell number significantly decreased 2-5 days treatment 10 nM hormone comparison control fibroblasts, also incorporation [3H]thymidine DNA decreased treatment cells 1 10 nM hormone 48 h. conclusion, data demonstrate 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates pyruvate kinase activity confluent-phase IMR-90 human fibroblasts mechanism probably dependent de novo protein synthesis, also affects cell growth DNA synthesis sub-confluent-phase cells.
