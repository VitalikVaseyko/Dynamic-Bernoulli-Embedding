 Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)(1) Escherichia coli regulated bifunctional protein, IDH kinase/phosphatase. paper, demonstrate effectors controlling activities belong two distinct classes differ mechanism locations binding sites. NADPH isocitrate representative members one effector classes. NADPH inhibits IDH kinase IDH phosphatase, whereas isocitrate inhibits IDH kinase. Isocitrate "activate" IDH phosphatase reversing product inhibition dephospho-IDH. Mutations icd, encodes IDH, parallel effects binding ligands IDH active site effects IDH kinase phosphatase, indicating ligands regulate IDH kinase/phosphatase IDH active site. Kinetic analyses suggested isocitrate NADPH prevent formation complex IDH kinase/phosphatase protein substrate. AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate represent class regulatory ligands distinct includes isocitrate NADPH. ligands bind directly IDH kinase/phosphatase, conclusion supported observation inhibit IDH-independent ATPase activity enzyme. effector classes also distinguished observation mutant derivatives IDH kinase/phosphatase expressed aceK3 aceK4 exhibited dramatic changes responses AMP, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate NADPH isocitrate.
