 OBJECTIVE: prospective study examines diagnostic prognostic use tumor-M2-pyruvate kinase (Tu-M2-PK) used conjunction carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 patients subsequently histologically confirmed periampullary malignancy. METHODS: Plasma Tu-M2-PK serum CA 19-9 levels measured admission cohort patients suspected pancreatic cancer. Values Tu-M2-PK serum CA 19-9 compared control group comprising jaundiced patients malignancy excluded endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography nonjaundiced individuals undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. RESULTS: mean (SD) plasma Tu-M2-PK level patients histologically proven malignancy 40.5 (26.4) U/mL noncancer patients, 29.9 (20.9) U/mL (Mann-Whitney U = 1163, P = 0.006). Tumor-M2-pyruvate kinase area curve 0.623 receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, optimal cutoff 27 U/mL, sensitivity 66%, specificity 58%.However, multivariate Cox regression modeling, elevated Tu-M2-PK (>27 U/mL) strongly correlated subsequent finding poorly differentiated cancer and/or metastatic disease strongly predicted survival Kaplan-Meier analysis. CONCLUSION: elevated Tu-M2-PK 27 U/mL measured admission suspected periampullary cancer predictor adverse prognosis periampullary cancer.
