 High-throughput screening small-molecule library identified 5-triazolo-2-arylpyridazinone novel inhibitor important glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). inhibitors interest due PFKFB3's control important glycolytic pathway used cancer cells generate ATP. series analogues synthesized study structure-activity relationships key enzyme inhibition. Changes triazolo pyridazinone rings favoured, limited-size substitutions aryl ring provided modest increases potency enzyme. Selected analogues literature-described inhibitors evaluated ability suppress glycolytic pathway, detected decrease lactate production, none compounds demonstrated suppression non-cytotoxic concentrations.
