 purpose present study examine whether lack skeletal muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) affects switch substrate utilization fed fasted state fasting-induced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) regulation skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1alpha knockout (MKO) mice floxed littermate controls fed fasted 24 h. Fasting reduced PDHa activity, increased phosphorylation four known sites PDH-E1alpha increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4) sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) protein levels, alter total acetylation PDH-E1alpha Lack muscle PGC-1alpha affect switch glucose fat oxidation transition fed fasted state, associated lower higher respiratory exchange ratio (RER) fed fasted state, respectively. PGC-1alpha MKO mice lower skeletal muscle PDH-E1alpha, PDK1, 2, 4, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP1) protein content controls, prevent fasting-induced increase PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation PGC-1alpha MKO mice. However, lack skeletal muscle PGC-1alpha reduced SIRT3 protein content, increased total lysine PDH-E1alpha acetylation fed state, prevented fasting-induced increase SIRT3 protein. conclusion, skeletal muscle PGC-1alpha required fasting-induced upregulation skeletal muscle SIRT3 maintaining high fat oxidation fasted state, dispensable preserving capability switch substrate transition fed fasted state fasting-induced PDH regulation skeletal muscle.
