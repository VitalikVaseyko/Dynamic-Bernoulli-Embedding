 Activation CD4+ cells results rapid proliferation differentiation effector regulatory subsets. CD4+ effector cell (Teff) (Th1 Th17) Treg subsets metabolically distinct, yet specific metabolic differences modify cell populations uncertain. Here, evaluated CD4+ cell populations murine models determined inflammatory Teffs maintain high expression glycolytic genes rely high glycolytic rates, Tregs oxidative require mitochondrial electron transport proliferate, differentiate, survive. Metabolic profiling revealed pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) key bifurcation point cell glycolytic oxidative metabolism. PDH function inhibited PDH kinases (PDHKs). PDHK1 expressed Th17 cells, Th1 cells, low levels Tregs, inhibition knockdown PDHK1 selectively suppressed Th17 cells increased Tregs. alteration CD4+ cell populations mediated part ROS, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment restored Th17 cell generation. Moreover, inhibition PDHK1 modulated immunity protected animals experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, decreasing Th17 cells increasing Tregs. Together, data show CD4+ subsets utilize require distinct metabolic programs targeted control specific cell populations autoimmune inflammatory diseases.
