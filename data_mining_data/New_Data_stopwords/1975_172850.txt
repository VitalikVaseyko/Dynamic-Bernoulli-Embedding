 male child presented first day life metabolic acidosis elevated blood lactate (15 mM), pyruvate (0.4 mM), free fatty acid (1.3 mM) levels blood pH 7.16. severity acidosis diminished intravenous administration glucose large doses bicarbonate. two occasions, acidosis particularly severe, peritoneal dialysis using acetate buffer required. Restriction dietary intake saturated fatty acids treatment nicotinic acid also appeared diminish severity acidosis. improvement achieved administration thiamine biotin. Tissues taken postmortem showed normal activity gluconeogenic enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase. activity pyruvate dehydrogenase tissue homogenates preincubated ATP reduced 60-75% liver patient controls inactivation enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Addition Ca++ Mg++ inactivated enzyme caused prompt return activity normal controls patient. defect, apparent muscle liver brain, attribute markedly reduced activity pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase patient.
