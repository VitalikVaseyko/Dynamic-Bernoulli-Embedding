 Metabolism bladder cancer represents key issue cancer research. Several metabolic altered pathways involved bladder tumorigenesis, representing therefore interesting targets therapy. Tumor cells, including urothelial cancer cells, rely peculiar shift aerobic glycolysis-dependent metabolism (the Warburg-effect) main energy source sustain uncontrolled growth proliferation. Therefore, high glycolytic flux depends overexpression glycolysis-related genes (SRC-3, glucose transporter type 1 [GLUT1], GLUT3, lactic dehydrogenase [LDHA], LDHB, hexokinase 1 [HK1], HK2, pyruvate kinase type [PKM], hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha [HIF-1alpha]), resulting overproduction pyruvate, alanine lactate. Concurrently, bladder cancer metabolism displays increased expression genes favoring pentose phosphate pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD]) fatty-acid synthesis (fatty acid synthase [FASN]), along decrease AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) Krebs cycle activities. Moreover, PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, hyper-activated bladder cancer, acts central regulator aerobic glycolysis, hence contributing cancer metabolic switch tumor cell proliferation. Besides glycolysis, glycogen metabolism pathway plays robust role bladder cancer development. particular, overexpression GLUT-1, loss tumor suppressor glycogen debranching enzyme amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase (AGL), increased activity tumor promoter enzyme glycogen phosphorylase impair glycogen metabolism. increase glucose uptake, decrease normal cellular glycogen storage, overproduction lactate consequences decreased oxidative phosphorylation inability reuse glucose pentose phosphate de novo fatty acid synthesis pathways. Moreover, AGL loss determines augmented levels serine-to-glycine enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2), resulting increased glycine purine ring nucleotides synthesis, thus supporting cells proliferation. deep understanding metabolic phenotype bladder cancer provide novel opportunities targeted therapeutic strategies.
