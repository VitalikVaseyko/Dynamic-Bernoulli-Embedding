 prevalence obesity increasing globally, obesity major risk factor type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease. investigated effects coffee polyphenols (CPP), abundant coffee consumed worldwide, diet-induced body fat accumulation. C57BL/6J mice fed either control diet, high-fat diet, high-fat diet supplemented 0.5 1.0% CPP 2-15 wk. Supplementation CPP significantly reduced body weight gain, abdominal liver fat accumulation, infiltration macrophages adipose tissues. Energy expenditure evaluated indirect calorimetry significantly increased CPP-fed mice. mRNA levels sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 -2, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 liver significantly lower CPP-fed mice high-fat control mice. Similarly, CPP suppressed expression molecules Hepa 1-6 cells, concomitant increase microRNA-122. Structure-activity relationship studies nine quinic acid derivatives isolated CPP Hepa 1-6 cells suggested mono- di-caffeoyl quinic acids (CQA) active substances beneficial effects CPP. Furthermore, CPP 5-CQA decreased nuclear active form SREBP-1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, cellular malonyl-CoA levels. findings indicate CPP enhances energy metabolism reduces lipogenesis downregulating SREBP-1c related molecules, leads suppression body fat accumulation.
