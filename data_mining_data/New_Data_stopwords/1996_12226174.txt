 development Brassica nigra seedlings 20 growth disrupted fungicide phosphonate (Phi) manner inversely correlated nutritional inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels. growth Pi-sufficient (1.25 mM Pi) seedlings suppressed 10, 5, mM Phi added nutrient medium. contrast, fresh weights root:shoot ratios Pi-limited (0.15 mM) seedlings significantly reduced 1.5 mM Phi, progressively declined 40% control values medium Phi concentration increased 10 mM. Intracellular Pi levels generally decreased Phi-treated seedlings, Phi accumulated leaves roots levels 6- 16-fold Pi Pi-sufficient Pi-limited plants, respectively. Extractable activities Pi-starvation-inducible enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase inorganic pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase unaltered Pi-sufficient seedlings grown 5 10 mM Phi. However, Pi-limited seedlings grown 1.5 10 mM Phi (a) induction phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase inorganic pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase activities Pi limitation reduced 40 90%, whereas (b) soluble protein concentrations activities ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase unaffacted. concluded Phi specifically interrupts processes involved regulation Pi-starvation response B. nigra.
