 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (E-TKI) resistance emerged important clinical issue. overcome resistance, researchers examined different modalities, either use monotherapy combination E-TKI therapy. present study, investigated whether decrease nitric oxide (NO) levels affects radiosensitization non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. A549 H3255 NSCLC cells examined. subjected hypoxic conditions monotherapy, combined therapy using radiation N(G) -monomethyl-l-arginine, monoacetate (LNMMA). Reductions nitric oxide levels enhanced radiosensitivity cell lines significantly reduced expression hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) EGFR H3255 cells compared A549 cells. Since significantly associated cell metabolism, measured levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), reactive oxygen species, oxygen observed expression PDK-1 significantly reduced. reduction seen simultaneously silencing HIF-1alpha; however, following LNMMA treatment. oxygen concentration significantly increased treated cells, viability decreased parallel. Reactive oxygen species decreased LNMMA radiation treatment. Adding EGFR-TKI cells reduced levels suppressed cell viability combined radiation. study suggests reduction level might substantially overcome radioresistance mutant NSCLC cells.
