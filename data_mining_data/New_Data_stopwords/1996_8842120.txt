 intraspecific variation described Trypanosoma cruzi examined recent isolates Chagas' disease patients, using behavioral molecular markers characterization parasite stocks derived clones. used parasite populations determine virulence pathogenicity vivo. T.cruzi stocks mSLU142 (megaesophagus) hSLU239 (heart disease) clones h1 h2 induced low parasitemias BALB/c mice, whereas high parasitemias obtained clones m1, m2, m3, m4. Clones m1-m4 also produced heart lesions higher intensity observed mice infected h1 h2 clones. Furthermore, heart lesions produced clones significantly intense seen mice infected either T. cruzi parental stocks. addition, neither kinetics growth, doubling time, differentiation axenic culture, zymodemes, DNA restriction length polymorphisms showed correlations parasitemias pathogenicity mice. study suggests multiple biochemical physiological markers required enable association clinical pathologic manifestations disease intrinsic characters T. cruzi populations.
