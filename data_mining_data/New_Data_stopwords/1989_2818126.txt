 Cell-free extracts two strictly anaerobic mollicutes, Anaeroplasma intermedium 5LA Asteroleplasma anaerobium 161T, tested enzymic activities intracellular carbohydrate metabolism. Asteroleplasma anaerobium also tested enzymes purine pyrimidine metabolism. organisms enzymic activities associated nonoxidative portion pentose phosphate pathway, Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) Asteroleplasma anaerobium ATP-dependent, whereas PFK Anaeroplasma intermedium PPi-dependent. two anaerobic mollicutes also differed respect enzymes converted phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate; Anaeroplasma intermedium pyruvate kinase activity, Asteroleplasma anaerobium pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase activity (PPi-dependent). organisms lactate dehydrogenase activity activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2). Anaeroplasma intermedium activity PEP carboxykinase (activated Fru-1,6-P2), Asteroleplasma anaerobium not. PEP carboxytransphosphorylase activity detected either organism. Anaeroplasma intermedium malate dehydrogenase isocitrate dehydrogenase activities, activities three tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes examined; Asteroleplasma anaerobium malate dehydrogenase activity only. Asteroleplasma anaerobium enzymic activities interconversion purine nucleobases, (deoxy)ribonucleosides, (deoxy)ribomononucleotides, including PPi-dependent nucleoside kinase, reported heretofore mollicutes. Asteroleplasma anaerobium could synthesize dTDP thymine salvage pathway deoxyribose 1-phosphate provided, dUTPase, ATPase, dCMP kinase activities. lacked (deoxy)cytidine deaminase, dCMP deaminase, deoxycytidine kinase activities.
