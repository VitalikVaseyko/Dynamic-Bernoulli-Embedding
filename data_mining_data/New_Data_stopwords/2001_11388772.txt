 vitro cultures, cell virtually isolated longer rely mechanisms physiological regulation substrate availability found tissues. emphasis laid utilization preponderant substrate proposed reciprocal relationship glycolysis free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation energy. Supraphysiological concentrations gamma-linolenic acid polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) therefore suppress glycolysis also inhibit FFA oxidation initiated cytochrome P450-mediated epoxidation PUFA inhibit fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity. FAS inhibition accumulates malonyl CoA inhibits carnitine palmitoyl transferase prevents FFA oxidation. cell starved energy anabolic intermediates, leading decreased proliferation death tumor cells. Tumor cells vulnerable induced toxicity due possession specific phenotypes elevated expression FAS pyruvate kinase, type M2, factors inducing tumor cell apoptosis inhibition.
