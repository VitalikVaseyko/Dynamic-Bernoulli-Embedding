 Chronic hyperglycemia deleterious effects pancreatic beta-cell function, process known glucotoxicity. study examined whether chronic high glucose (CHG) induces cellular hypoxia rat INS-1 beta cells, whether hyperoxia (35% O2) reverse glucotoxicity-induced inhibition insulin secretion. CHG (33.3 mm, 96 h) reduced insulin secretion, down-regulated insulin pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor 1 gene expression. CHG also increased intracellular pimonidazole-protein adducts, marker hypoxia. CHG also enhanced hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein expression DNA-binding activity, accompanied decrease mRNA expression glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), glucokinase uncoupling protein-2 increase mRNA expression GLUT1 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. Hyperoxia restored decrease insulin secretion gene expression except GLUT2, suppressed intracellular hypoxia HIF-1alpha activation. results suggest glucotoxicity may cause beta-cell hypoxia. Hyperoxia might prevent glucotoxicity-induced beta-cell dysfunction improve insulin secretion.
