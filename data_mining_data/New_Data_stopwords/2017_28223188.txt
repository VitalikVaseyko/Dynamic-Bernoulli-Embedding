 INTRODUCTION: Inherited anemias diagnostic workup requires step-wise algorithm. Causal genes implicated congenital hemolytic anemia numerous, making gene-by-gene approach Sanger sequencing time consuming, expensive labour intensive. Targeted resequencing great use explaining cases. METHODOLOGY: Six months female presented neonatal jaundice negative family history. Clinical laboratory evidences suggestive hemolytic anemia. G6PD deficiency, thalassemias, hemoglobinopathies, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hereditary spherocytosis pyruvate kinase deficiency excluded. Targeted resequencing Illumina MiSeq using TruSight One sequencing panel performed identify causative mutations. RESULTS: 35-40% RBCs acanthocytes echinocytes. missense homozygous mutation found inglucose-6-phosphate isomerase, GPI [c.1040G>A (p.Arg347His), rs137853583] results nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. CONCLUSION: study describes GPI p.Arg347His mutation first time India first report red cell GPI deficiency diagnosed using NGS-based resequencing highlights potential technique clinical practice.
