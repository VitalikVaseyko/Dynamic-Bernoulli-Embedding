 CANCER METABOLIC DISEASE SOLUTION TWO METABOLIC EQUATIONS: produce energy limited resources fulfill biosynthetic needs proliferating cells. equations solved glycolysis uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation tricarboxylic acid cycle, process known glycolytic switch. review addresses comprehensive manner main molecular events accounting high-rate glycolysis cancer. starts modulation Pasteur Effect allowing short-term adaptation hypoxia, highlights key role exerted hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 long-term adaptation hypoxia, summarizes current knowledge concerning necessary involvement aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) cancer cell proliferation. Based many observations positioning glycolysis central player malignancy, advanced anticancer treatments targeting tumor glycolysis briefly reviewed.
