 OBJECTIVE: hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) flux protein O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) levels implicated mediating adverse effects diabetes cardiovascular system. Activation pathways glucosamine shown mimic diabetes-induced functional structural changes heart; however, effect cardiac metabolism known. Therefore, primary goal study determine effects glucosamine cardiac substrate utilization. METHODS: Isolated rat hearts perfused glucosamine (0-10 mM) increase HBP flux normoxic conditions. Metabolic fluxes determined (13)C-NMR isotopomer analysis; UDP-GlcNAc precursor O-GlcNAc synthesis assessed HPLC immunoblot analysis used determine O-GlcNAc levels, phospho- total levels AMPK ACC, membrane levels FAT/CD36. RESULTS: Glucosamine caused dose dependent increase UDP-GlcNAc O-GlcNAc levels, associated significant increase palmitate oxidation concomitant decrease lactate pyruvate oxidation. effect glucosamine AMPK ACC phosphorylation; however, membrane levels fatty acid transport protein FAT/CD36 increased preliminary studies suggest FAT/CD36 potential target O-GlcNAcylation. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: data demonstrate acute modulation HBP protein O-GlcNAcylation heart stimulates fatty acid oxidation, possibly increasing plasma membrane levels FAT/CD36, raising intriguing possibility HBP O-GlcNAc turnover represent novel, glucose dependent mechanism regulating cardiac metabolism.
