 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converts pyruvate acetyl-CoA, links glycolysis Krebs cycle, plays important role glucose metabolism insulin secretion pancreatic beta cells. beta cells obese Type 2 diabetic animals, PDH activity significantly reduced. PDH negatively regulated multiple pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isotypes (PDK subtypes 1-4). However, know whether fatty acids high glucose modulate PDKs islets. test determined PDH PDK activities PDK gene protein expression C57BL/6 mouse islets. high palmitate high glucose reduced active PDH activity increased PDK activity. gene protein PDK3 expressed islets. Palmitate up-regulated mRNA expression PDK1 (2.9-fold), PDK2 (1.9-fold), PDK4 (3.1-fold). High glucose increased PDK1 (1.8-fold) PDK2 (2.7-fold) mRNA expression reduced PDK4 mRNA expression 40 percent cultured islets. Changed PDK expression confirmed Western blotting. results demonstrate islet cells fat glucose regulate PDK gene protein expression indicate hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia contribute decline diabetic islet PDH activity increasing mRNA protein expression PDK.
