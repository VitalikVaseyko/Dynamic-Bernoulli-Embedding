 process photorespiration diminishes efficiency CO(2) assimilation yield C(3)-crops wheat, rice, soybean potato, important feeding growing world population. Photorespiration starts competitive inhibition CO(2) fixation O(2) active site ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) result loss 50% CO(2) fixed ambient air. contrast, C(4) plants, maize, sugar cane Sorghum, possess CO(2) concentrating mechanism, atmospheric CO(2) bound C(4)-carbon compounds shuttled mesophyll cells prefixation bicarbonate occurs via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) gas-tight bundle-sheath cells, bound carbon released CO(2) enters Calvin cycle. However, anatomical division mesophyll bundle-sheaths cells ("Kranz"-anatomy) appears prerequisite operation CO(2) concentrating mechanism. Submerged aquatic macrophytes, instance, induce C(4)-like CO(2) concentrating mechanism one cell type CO(2) becomes limiting. single cell C(4)-mechanism also reported recently terrestrial chenopod. 10 years researchers laboratories around world attempted improve photosynthesis crop yield introducing single cell C(4)-cycle C(3) plants transgenic approach. meantime, substantial progress overexpressing key enzymes C(4) cycle rice, potato, tobacco. review focus biochemical physiological consequences overexpression C(4)-cycle genes C(3) plants. Bearing mind C(4)-cycle enzymes also present C(3) plants, pitfalls encountered C(3) metabolism perturbed overexpression individual C(4) genes also discussed.
