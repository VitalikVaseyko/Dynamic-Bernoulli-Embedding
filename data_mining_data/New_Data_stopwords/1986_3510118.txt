 Trifluoperazine (TFP), potent inhibitor calmodulin action, concentration 12 microM decreased stimulating effects insulin 1) fat cell pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activation, 2) generation/action PDH activator adipocyte plasma membranes, 3) insulin-induced loss insulin receptors, without altering spermine-induced activation fat cell PDH preventing insulin stimulation glucose oxidation. addition effects insulin action, TFP abolished several biological actions insulin-generated PDH stimulator liver particulate fractions. actions include fat cell PDH activation decrease receptors. data indicate TFP inhibits membrane-associated intracellular components insulin action. results suggest involvement calcium-binding protein (calmodulin) and/or phospholipid dependent-calcium activated protein kinase C actions insulin fat cells. insulin effect glucose oxidation appears less dependent mediators.
