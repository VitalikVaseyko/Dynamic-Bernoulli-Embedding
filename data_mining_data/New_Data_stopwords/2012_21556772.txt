 High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) plays important role myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. Ethyl pyruvate (EP), potent reactive oxygen species scavenger, reported inhibit myocardial apoptosis reduce myocardial I/R injury. aim study investigate mechanism EP reduces myocardial I/R injury rats. Anesthetized male rats treated EP (50 mg/kg, i.p.) ischemia, subjected ischemia 30 min followed reperfusion 4 h. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity infarct size measured. HMGB1 expression assessed immunoblotting. results showed pretreatment EP (50 mg/kg) could significantly reduce infarct size levels LDH CK 4 h reperfusion (all P<0.05). EP could also significantly inhibit increase MDA level, decrease SOD level (both P<0.05). Meanwhile, EP could significantly inhibit expression HMGB1 induced I/R. present study suggested ethyl pyruvate could attenuate myocardial I/R injury inhibiting HMGB1 expression.
