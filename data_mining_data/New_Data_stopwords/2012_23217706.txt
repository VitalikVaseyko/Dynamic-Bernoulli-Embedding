 Reprogramming cellular metabolism key event tumorigenesis. Despite known decades (Warburg effect), molecular mechanisms regulating switch remained unexplored. Here, identify SIRT6 tumor suppressor regulates aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. Importantly, loss SIRT6 leads tumor formation without activation known oncogenes, whereas transformed SIRT6-deficient cells display increased glycolysis tumor growth, suggesting SIRT6 plays role establishment maintenance cancer. using conditional SIRT6 allele, show SIRT6 deletion vivo increases number, size, aggressiveness tumors. SIRT6 also functions regulator ribosome metabolism corepressing MYC transcriptional activity. Lastly, Sirt6 selectively downregulated several human cancers, expression levels SIRT6 predict prognosis tumor-free survival rates, highlighting SIRT6 critical modulator cancer metabolism. studies reveal SIRT6 potent tumor suppressor acting suppress cancer metabolism.
