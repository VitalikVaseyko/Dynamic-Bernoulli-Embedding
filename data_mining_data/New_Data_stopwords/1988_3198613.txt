 Tryptic digestion fully phosphorylated Ascaris suum pyruvate dehydrogenase complex yielded single tetradecapeptide containing 2 phosphorylated serine residues. amino acid sequence Tyr-Ser-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asp-Pro-Gly-Thr-Ser(P)-Tyr-Arg similar one tryptic phosphopeptides isolated mammalian yeast pyruvate dehydrogenases. partial phosphorylation, three peptides isolated corresponded monophosphorylated (sites 1 2) diphosphorylated tetradecapeptides. contrast results reported mammalian complexes, phosphorylation ascarid complex paralleled inactivation, additional phosphorylation occurred inactivation complete. Complete inactivation complex associated incorporation 1.7-1.9 mol phosphoryl groups/mol alpha-pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit, strict preference pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase site 1 observed. Whereas site 1 initially phosphorylated rapidly site 2, 50% inactivation, 41% incorporated phosphoryl groups incorporated site 2. addition, substantial amounts peptide monophosphorylated site 2 also accumulated, suggesting prior phosphorylation site 1 necessary phosphorylation site 2. Phosphorylation also caused marked decrease mobility alpha-pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels apparent separation mono- diphosphorylated forms enzyme. significance observations regulation unique anaerobic mitochondrial metabolism A. suum discussed.
