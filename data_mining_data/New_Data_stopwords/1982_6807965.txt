 One-carbon metabolic transformations associated cell carbon synthesis methanogenesis analyzed long- short-term (14)CH(3)OH (14)CO(2) incorporation studies growth cell suspensions. (14)CH(3)OH (14)CO(2) equivalently incorporated major cellular components (i.e., lipids, proteins, nucleic acids) growth H(2)-CO(2)-methanol. (14)CH(3)OH selectively incorporated C-3 alanine decreased amounts fixed C-1 C-2 positions, whereas (14)CO(2) selectively incorporated C(1) moiety decreasing amounts assimilated C-2 C-3 atoms. Notably, (14)CH(4) [3-(14)C]alanine synthesized (14)CH(3)OH growth shared common specific activity distinct CO(2) methanol. Cell suspensions synthesized acetate alanine (14)CO(2). addition iodopropane inhibited acetate synthesis decrease amount (14)CH(3)OH (14)CO(2) fixed one-carbon carriers (i.e., methyl coenzyme carboxydihydromethanopterin). Carboxydihydromethanopterin labeled (14)CH(3)OH absence hydrogen. Cell extracts catalyzed synthesis acetate (14)CO ( approximately 1 nmol/min per mg protein) isotopic exchange CO(2) CO C-1 pyruvate. Acetate synthesis (14)CO stimulated methyl B(12) methyl tetrahydrofolate methyl coenzyme M. Methyl coenzyme coenzyme inhibitory acetate synthesis. Cell extracts contained high levels phosphotransacetylase (>6 mumol/min per mg protein) acetate kinase (>0.14 mumol/min per mg protein). possible distinguish acetate acetyl coenzyme immediate product two-carbon synthesis methods employed.
