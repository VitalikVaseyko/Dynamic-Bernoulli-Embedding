 metabolism adenine, administered intravenously orally, studied patient red cell pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficiency. Intravenous infusion 58.5 mumol adenine per kg containing 6475 Bq 8-14C adenine caused initial decrease red cell ATP level gradual return pre-infusion level coincided increase radiolabelled ATP. infused adenine, 1.3% entered red cell pool 2 h. route administration affected urinary excretion adenine oxymetabolites; 6 h, 10.7% infused adenine excreted, compared 7.4% ingestion similar dose. 10 control subjects given 45.1-55.5 mumol/kg, excretion adenine plus oxymetabolites accounted 13.5 +/- 2.9% ingested dose. Differences also observed urinary purine excretion patterns two routes administration. study shown adenine incorporated ATP red cells PK-deficient patient.
