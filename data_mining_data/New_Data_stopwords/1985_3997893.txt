 define clearly interactions mitochondrial creatine kinase adenine nucleotide translocase, outer membrane rat heart mitochondria removed digitonin, producing inner membrane-matrix (mitoplast) preparation. mitoplast fracton well-coupled contained high specific activity mitochondrial creatine kinase. Outer membrane permeabilization documented loss adenylate kinase, soluble intermembrane enzyme, direct antibody inhibition mitochondrial creatine kinase activity. preparation, documented four important aspects functional coupling. Kinetic studies showed oxidative phosphorylation decreased value ternary enzyme-substrate complex dissociation constant MgATP 140 16 microM. Two approaches used document adenine nucleotide translocase specificity ADP generated mitochondrial creatine kinase. Exogenous pyruvate kinase (20 IU/ml) could readily phosphorylate ADP produced creatine kinase, since added pyruvate kinase markedly inhibit creatine + ATP-stimulated respiration. Additionally, ADP produced mitochondrial creatine kinase, inhibition translocase required 2 nmol atractyloside/mg mitoplast protein, 1 nmol/mg necessary exogenous ADP added. Finally, mass action ratio mitochondrial creatine kinase reaction exceeded apparent equilibrium constant ATP supplied creatine kinase reaction oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, results consistent much data intact rat heart mitochondria, suggest outer membrane plays minor role compartmentation adenine nucleotides. Furthermore, since removal outer membrane alter unique coupling oxidative phosphorylation mitochondrial creatine kinase, suggest cooperation result protein-protein proximity inner membrane surface.
