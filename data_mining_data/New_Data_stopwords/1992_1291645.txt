 Weaning rats divided two groups, one group fed vitamin E-deficient diet, alpha-tocopherol-containing (50 mg/kg) control diet. Rats killed 1, 2, 3 4 months feeding. following results obtained. 1. plasma liver alpha-tocopherol levels decreased greatly feeding vitamin E-deficient diet 1 month, thereafter decreased gradually continued feeding. 2. Somehow different results obtained concerning liver peroxidation value method analysis. case chemiluminescence, value increased vitamin E deficiency first 2 months, thereafter, value almost unchanged. contrary, case TBA-RS, value increased gradually throughout entire 4 months feeding period. 3. plasma alpha-CPI level pyruvate kinase activity increased vitamin E deficiency, showing similar pattern change feeding period. Especially, marked increase values observed vitamin E-deficient rats fed longer 2 months, differences control groups highly significant (in cases, 2 months, p < 0.005, 3 4 months, p < 0.001). And, vitamin E-deficient group, including rats fed test diet 1 4 months, correlation values high, highly significant (r = 0.9060, p < 0.001).
