 Prolactin (PRL) induces beta-cell proliferation glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) counteracts effects glucocorticoids insulin production. mechanisms PRL up-regulates GSIS unknown. used rat islets insulinoma (INS-1) cells explore interactions PRL, glucose, dexamethasone (DEX) regulation beta-cell pyruvate carboxylase (PC), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), catalyze phosphorylation inactivation PDH. PRL increased GSIS 37% (P < 0.001) rat islets. Glucose supraphysiological concentrations (11 mm) increased PC mRNA islets; contrast, PRL suppressed PC mRNA levels islets INS-1 cells, whereas DEX without effect. Neither PRL DEX altered PC protein activity levels. INS-1 cells, PRL increased PDH activity 1.4- 2-fold (P < 0.05-0.001) glucose concentrations ranging 2.5-11 mm. DEX reduced PDH activity; effect reversed PRL. PDK1, -2, -3, -4 mRNAs detected islets insulinoma cells, latter expressed trivial amounts PDK4. PRL reduced PDK2 mRNA protein levels rat islets INS-1 cells PDK4 mRNA islets; DEX increased PDK2 mRNA islets INS-1 cells; effect reversed PRL. findings suggest PRL induction GSIS mediated increases beta-cell PDH activity; facilitated suppression PDKs. PRL counteracts effects DEX PDH PDK expression, suggesting novel roles lactogens defense diabetes.
