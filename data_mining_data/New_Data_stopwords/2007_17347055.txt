 Pharmaceuticals Personal Care Products (PPCPs) class emerging environmental pollutants potential affecting various aquatic organisms unexpected modes action. Triclosan (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether) (TCS), common antibacterial agent found significant amounts aquatic environment. work, possible effects modes action TCS investigated marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam. mussel immune cells, hemocytes, vitro short-term exposure TCS low microM range reduced lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) induced extracellular release lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes. effects LMS mediated activation ERK MAPKs (Extracellularly Regulated Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases) PKC (protein kinase C) alpha betaII isoforms, demonstrated specific kinase inhibitors Western blotting specific anti-phospho-antibodies. effects TCS confirmed vivo, hemocytes mussels injected different concentrations TCS (corresponding 0.29, 2.9 29 ng/g dry weight) sampled 24 h post-injection. possible vivo effects TCS also evaluated activity different enzymes digestive gland, tissue mainly involved accumulation metabolism organic contaminants mussels. Significant increases observed activity glycolytic enzymes PFK (phosphofructokinase) PK (pyruvate kinase), well GST (GSH transferase) GSR (GSSG reductase), whereas decrease catalase activity observed. results demonstrate mussels TCS act kinase-mediated cell signalling, lysosomal membranes redox balance different systems/organs. Although studies needed order evaluate possible consequences environmental exposure TCS mussel health, results represent first data possible modes action widespread antibacterial aquatic invertebrates.
