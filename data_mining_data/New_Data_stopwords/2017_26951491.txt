 BACKGROUND: Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) licorice chalcone. According CN104758274, CN101658513 US009089546, claimed ISL anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-tumoral effects. OBJECTIVE: study aimed investigate potential therapeutic effect ISL mouse melanoma B16F10 cells. METHODS: Sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric assay used test effects ISL proliferation. Commercial assay kits applied assess glucose uptake, lactate production ATP levels. Measurement apoptosis involved Hoechst 33258, JC-1 annexin V-FITC/PI staining. H2DCFDA probe employed detect ROS generation. Quantitative RT-PCR western blot utilized measure mRNA protein levels. RESULTS: ISL abated hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) stability reduced series glycolysis-relevant enzymes expression, including glucose transporters 1/4 (GLUT 1/4), hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA). Exposure ISL induced mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. ISL could effectively inhibit proliferation alleviate hypoxia mouse melanoma B16F10 cells via inducing apoptosis reducing expression significant enzymes glycolysis. ISL significantly inhibited B16F10 cell proliferation via inducing apoptosis, alleviated hypoxia recovering mitochondrial function reversing high glycolysis. CONCLUSION: findings propose ISL promising therapeutic agent melanoma via reliving hypoxia microenvironment targeting energy metabolism system cancer cells. Consistent WO2015079213 WO2014084494, targeting glycolysis effective means anti-cancer.
