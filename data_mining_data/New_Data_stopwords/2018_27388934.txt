 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) common inherited peripheral neuropathy. X-linked form CMT (CMTX6) caused missense mutation (R158H) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 3 (PDK3) gene. PDK3 one 4 isoenzymes negatively regulate activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) reversible phosphorylation first catalytic component pyruvate dehydrogenase (designated E1). Mitochondrial PDC catalyses oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate acetyl CoA links glycolysis energy-producing Krebs cycle. previously shown R158H mutation confers PDK3 enzyme hyperactivity. study demonstrate increased PDK3 activity patient fibroblasts (PDK3(R158H)) leads attenuation PDC hyper-phosphorylation E1 selected serine residues. hyper-phosphorylation reversed treating PDK3(R158H) fibroblasts PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA). patient cells, down-regulation PDC leads increased lactate, decreased ATP alteration mitochondrial network. findings highlight potential develop specific drug targeting mutant PDK3 therapeutic approach treating CMTX6.
