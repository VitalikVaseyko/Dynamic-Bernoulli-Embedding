 Adult B6C3F1 male mice given water containing 3, 15, 75 ppm mercury (as mercuric chloride) 7 weeks. dose-related increases blood kidney mercury levels former showed time-dependent change. Mercury detected lymphoid organs except spleen. mortality minimal histological changes occurred kidneys dosed mice. Nonspecific toxicity occurred 75 ppm dose level, consisting small differences body organ weights, hematological changes, general enzyme inhibition bone marrow spleen. However, specific immunotoxic biochemical alterations lymphoid organs mice treated lower doses mercury. immunological defects consistent altered T-cell function evidenced decreases T-cell mitogen mixed leukocyte responses. particular association T-cell defects inhibition thymic pyruvate kinase, rate-limiting enzyme glycolysis. differences pattern enzyme responses among lymphoid organs implied two mechanisms mercury toxicity operative--one high concentrations caused physicochemical enzyme inhibition another low concentrations caused indirect enzyme inhibition.
