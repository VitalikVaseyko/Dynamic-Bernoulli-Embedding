 Recent studies suggest several types tumors preferentially metabolize glucose aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known Warburg effect. However, remains largely unexplored whether metabolic reprogramming involved prostate cancer (PCa) progression. study, found histone methyltransferase enhancer zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) dysregulated PCa development regulated cellular growth aerobic glycolysis miR-181b/hexokinase 2 (HK2) axis. Aberrant expression profiles coding RNA microRNA examined two large, independent clinical prostate cancer data sets. results indicated EZH2 expression elevated followed PCa development. set glycometabolism-related genes positively correlated EZH2 expression HK2.The depletion EZH2 cell experiments inhibited PCa cell growth aerobic glycolysis accompanying up-regulation miR-181b. Western blot luciferase reporter assays showed miR-181b inversely modulated HK2 directly targeting binding site within 3'-untranslated regions. Moreover, decreased miR-181b expression largely abrogated effect sh-EZH2 HK2 expression HK2-induced glucose metabolism process. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) situ hybridisation (ISH) analysis revealed significant correlation EZH2, miR-181b HK2 expression nude mouse tumor xenograft. Taken together, findings provide first evidence EZH2/miR-181b/HK2 pathway plays positive role PCa development. Targeting aberrantly activated pathway may provide new therapeutic strategy PCa.
