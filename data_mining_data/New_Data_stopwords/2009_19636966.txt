 Mutations PKD2 gene lead development polycystic kidney disease (PKD). PKD2 gene codes polycystin-2, cation channel unknown function. cytoplasmic, C-terminal domain interacts large number proteins including mDia1, alpha-actinin, PIGEA-14, troponin, tropomyosin. C-terminal fragment polycystin-2 (680-796) consisting 117 amino acids contains putative calcium binding EF-hand. produced Escherichia coli enriched uniformly (13)C (15)N. backbone side chain resonances assigned multidimensional NMR methods, obtained chemical shifts typical partially folded protein. chemical shifts obtained line existence two paired helix-loop-helix (HLH) motifs.
