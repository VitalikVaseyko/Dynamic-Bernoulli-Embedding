 Although cancer metabolism received considerable attention past decade, knowledge specifics still fragmentary. Altered cellular metabolism one important hallmarks cancer. Cancer cells exhibit aberrant glucose metabolism characterized aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Accelerated glucose uptake glycolysis main characteristics cancer cells allow intensive growth proliferation. Accumulating evidence suggests O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), enzyme responsible modification proteins N-acetylglucosamine, may act nutrient sensor links hexosamine biosynthesis pathway oncogenic signaling regulation factors involved glucose lipid metabolism. Recent studies suggest metabolic reprograming cancer connected changes epigenetic level. O-GlcNAcylation seems play important role regulation epigenome response cellular metabolic status. histone modifications assembly gene transcription complexes, OGT impact expression genes important cellular metabolism. paper reviews recent findings related O-GlcNAc-dependent regulation signaling pathways, transcription factors, enzymes, epigenetic changes involved metabolic reprograming cancer.
