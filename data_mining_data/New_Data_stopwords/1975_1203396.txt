 Ca2+ inhibitory effect hexokinase (HK) pyruvatkinase activities studied. Kinetic analysis inhibition reaction carried determine inhibition type. Non-competitive inhibition respect reaction activator, Mg2+, found HK PK. basis graph analysis data reactions values activatory constant (KA) inhibitory constant (Ki) calculated. experimental results discussed respect possible regulatory effect Ca2+ glycolysis cycle.
