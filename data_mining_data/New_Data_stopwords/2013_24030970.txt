 Cancer stem cells (CSC) central role driving tumor growth. Since metabolism becoming important diagnostic therapeutic target, characterization CSC line energetic properties emerging need. Embryonic adult stem cells, compared differentiated cells, exhibit reduced mitochondrial activity stronger dependence aerobic glycolysis. Here, aimed comparatively analyze bioenergetics features human osteosarcoma 3AB-OS CSC-like line, parental osteosarcoma MG63 cells, 3AB-OS cells previously selected. results suggest 3AB-OS cells depend glycolytic metabolism strongly MG63 cells. Indeed, growth glucose shortage presence galactose pyruvate (mitochondrial specific substrates) leads significant reduction proliferation compared MG63 cells. Accordingly, 3AB-OS cells show increased expression lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) larger accumulation lactate culture medium. line findings 3AB-OS cells compared MG63 cells present reduced mitochondrial respiration, stronger sensitivity glucose depletion glycolysis inhibition lessened sensitivity oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors. Additionally, contrast MG63 cells, 3AB-OS display fragmented mitochondria, become networked grow glucose-rich medium, almost entirely loose structures growing low glucose. Overall, findings suggest 3AB-OS CSC energy metabolism similar normal stem cells cancer cells characterized glycolytic anaerobic metabolism.
