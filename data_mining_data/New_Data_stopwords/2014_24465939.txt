 Hyperglycemia hospitalized setting common, especially patients receive nutritional support either continuously intermittently. liver muscle major sites glucose disposal, hypothesized metabolic adaptations sensitive pattern nutrient delivery. Chronically catheterized, well-controlled depancreatized dogs placed one three isocaloric diets: regular chow diet daily (Chow) simple nutrient diet (ND) given either daily (ND-4) infused continuously (ND-C). Intraportal insulin infused maintain euglycemia. 5 days net hepatic (NHGU) muscle (MGU) glucose uptake oxidation assessed euglycemia (120 mg/dl) hyperglycemia (200 mg/dl) presence basal insulin. hyperglycemia increased NHGU MGU Chow, NHGU amplified groups receiving ND. increase associated enhanced activation glycogen synthase, glucose oxidation suppression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4). Accelerated glucose-dependent muscle glucose uptake evident ND-C. associated decrease PDK-4 expression increase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Interestingly, ND-C markedly increased hepatic FGF-21 expression. Thus, augmentation carbohydrate disposal liver, opposed muscle, dependent pattern nutrient delivery.
