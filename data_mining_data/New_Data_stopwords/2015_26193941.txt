 current study aimed identify differences presented proteome fluconazole-susceptible isolates Candida glabrata compared fluconazole-resistant ones. Two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis applied identify proteins differentially expressed fluconazole-susceptible fluconazole-resistant isolates C. glabrata. Eight proteins including aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, translation elongation factor 3, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, ribosomal protein L5, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, pyruvate kinase, G-beta like protein, F1F0-ATPase alpha subunit found abundantly represented, four proteins including vitamin B12-(cobalamin)-independent isozyme methionine synthase, microtubule-associated protein, adenylosuccinate synthetase, aldose reductase found less abundantly represented fluconazole-resistant strains versus fluconazole-susceptible ones. differentially expressed proteins primarily associated energy metabolism, stress response, macromolecule synthesis. Proteins associated energy metabolism, stress response, macromolecule synthesis may play role development fluconazole resistance clinical isolates C. glabrata. Multiple different mechanisms involved development fluconazole resistance C. glabrata. findings provide scientific basis discovering new genes mechanisms associated fluconazole resistance C. glabrata.
