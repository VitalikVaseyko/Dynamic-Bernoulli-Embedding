 Amyloid beta25-35 (Abeta25-35) represents neurotoxic fragment Abeta1-40 Abeta1-42, implicated progressive neurodegeneration cases Alzheimer disease (AD). Amyloid beta25-35 shown lyse rat erythrocytes (RBCs) ages, extent RBC toxicity directly correlated Abeta25-35 concentration cell age. Activities glycolytic, antioxidant, Na(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzymes, vivo, significantly decreased older RBCs compared young RBCs. vitro, Abeta25-35 reduced activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase increased Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity; effects significantly greater aged RBCs compared younger cells. diminution activity certain enzymes may determine life span RBCs vivo may relevant human AD; higher sensitivity older RBCs Abeta25-35 toxicity may contribute ultimate death RBCs patients AD.
