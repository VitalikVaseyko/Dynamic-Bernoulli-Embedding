 Sugar starvation exerted sub-10 mM levels sucrose Arabidopsis T87 suspension-cultured cells triggered marked accumulation transcripts genes E1beta E2 subunit branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Similar levels sugar starvation increased luciferase activity transgenic tobacco BY-2 lines expressing Arabidopsis E1beta- E2-promoter-luciferase fusion gene. results indicate sugar levels tightly regulate E1beta E2 promoter activity heterologous plant system. showed transgenic tobacco BY-2 lines sugar-starvation-induced activation E1beta E2 promoters prevented K-252a, inhibitor Ser/Thr protein kinase, enhanced okadaic acid, inhibitor protein phosphatases. contrast, cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter activity sugar-starved BY-2 cells significantly affected K-252a slightly enhanced okadaic acid. Taken together, propose transcriptional activation genes branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex modulation specific protein kinases/phosphatases critical importance branched-chain amino acid catabolism plant cells sugar starvation.
