 Regulation energy metabolism novel function p53 tumor suppression. Parkin (PARK2), Parkinson disease-associated gene, potential tumor suppressor whose expression frequently diminished tumors. Parkin identified p53 target gene important mediator p53's function regulating energy metabolism. human mouse Parkin genes contain functional p53 responsive elements, p53 increases transcription Parkin humans mice. Parkin contributes function p53 glucose metabolism; Parkin deficiency activates glycolysis reduces mitochondrial respiration, leading Warburg effect. Restoration Parkin expression reverses Warburg effect cells. Thus, Parkin deficiency novel mechanism Warburg effect tumors. Parkin also contributes function p53 antioxidant defense. Furthermore, Parkin deficiency sensitizes mice gamma-irradiation-induced tumorigenesis, provides direct evidence support role Parkin tumor suppression. results suggest novel component p53 pathway, Parkin contributes functions p53 regulating energy metabolism, especially Warburg effect, antioxidant defense, thus function p53 tumor suppression.
