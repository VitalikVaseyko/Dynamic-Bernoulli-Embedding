 scanning electron microscope used study surface morphologic features erythrocytes Basenji dog hereditary hemolytic anemia due pyruvate kinase-deficient erythrocytes (RBC). Cells dog compared RBC normal dogs dogs regenerative anemias unrelated pyruvate kinase deficiency. Demonstration spherical RBC uniform spicules surface (spheroechinocytes) may provide morphologic explanation shortened erythrocytic life-span previously reported congenital hemolytic anemia Basenji dogs. Spherical, spiculated RBC found blood normal dogs anemic dogs reticulocytoses. surface reticulocytes dogs regenerative anemia roughened, pronounced folding cell membrane.
