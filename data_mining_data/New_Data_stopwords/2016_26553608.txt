 Torpor phenotype characterized controlled decline metabolic rate body temperature. arousal torpor, organs undergo rapid metabolic reactivation rewarming near normal levels. torpor progress, animals show preference fatty acids glucose primary source energy. Here, analyzed first time changes maximal activity key enzymes related fatty acid (Carnitine palmitoyltransferase beta-Hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase) carbohydrate (Pyruvate kinase, Phosphofructokinase Lactate dehydrogenase) catabolism, well mitochondrial oxidative capacity (Citrate synthase), six organs torpid, arousing euthermic Chilean mouse-opossums (Thylamys elegans). results showed activity enzymes related fatty acid carbohydrate catabolism different among torpor phases pattern variation differs among tissues. terms lipid utilization, maximal enzymatic activities differ tissues high oxidative capacity heart, kidney, liver. terms carbohydrate use, lower enzymatic activities observed torpor brain liver. Interestingly, citrate synthase activity differ thought torpor-arousal cycle tissues analyzed, suggesting modulation mitochondrial content T. elegans. Overall results provide indication modulation enzymes associated carbohydrate fatty-acid pathways mainly oriented limit energy expensive processes sustain energy metabolism transition torpor euthermy. Future studies required elucidate physiological events observed T. elegans unique marsupials, represents general response marsupials. J. Exp. Zool. 325A:41-51, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
