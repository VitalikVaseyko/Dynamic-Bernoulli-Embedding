 Insulin treatment adipocytes increased amount activity low molecular weight, acid-stable material which, isolated intact adipocytes heat extraction subsequent Sephadex G25 chromatography, yielded single active fraction stimulated mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activating phosphatase altering kinase activity. Phosphatase activation demonstrated ability active material increase pyruvate dehydrogenase activity absence ATP ability NaF, phosphatase inhibitor, stimulation. Involvement kinase activation mechanism eliminated fact that, presence ATP, (1) NaF completely blocked stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase active fraction, (2) stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase dichloroacetic acid, kinase inhibitor, additive stimulation caused active fraction. active fraction may contain intracellular chemical mediator second messenger insulin.
