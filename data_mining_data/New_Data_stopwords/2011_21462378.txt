 Tumor cells increased glycolytic activity, glucose mainly used form lactate alanine, even high concentrations oxygen present (Warburg effect). purpose present study investigate glucose metabolism two xenograft models representing basal-like luminal-like breast cancer using (13) C high-resolution-magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) MRS gene expression analysis. Tumor tissue collected two groups model: untreated mice (n=19) group mice (n=16) received injection [1-(13) C]-glucose 10 15 min harvesting tissue. (13) C HR-MAS MRS performed tumor samples differences glucose/alanine (Glc/Ala), glucose/lactate (Glc/Lac) alanine/lactate (Ala/Lac) ratios models studied. expression glycolytic genes studied using tumor tissue models. natural abundance MR spectra, significantly lower Glc/Ala Glc/Lac ratio (p<0.001) observed luminal-like model compared basal-like model. labeled samples, predominant glucose metabolites lactate alanine. Significantly lower Glc/Ala Glc/Lac ratios observed luminal-like model (p<0.05). genes contributing glycolysis expressed higher levels luminal-like model (fdr<0.001). lower Glc/Ala Glc/Lac ratios higher glycolytic gene expression observed luminal-like model indicates transformation glucose lactate alanine occurred faster model basal-like model, growth rate several times faster luminal-like model. results present study suggest tumor growth rate necessarily determinant glycolytic activity.
