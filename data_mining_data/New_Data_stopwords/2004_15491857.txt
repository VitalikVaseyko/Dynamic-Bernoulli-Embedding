 Quantitative physiological characterization isotopic tracer experiments revealed pyruvate kinase mutants Bacillus subtilis produced significantly CO(2) glucose tricarboxylic acid cycle explained remaining conversion phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate catalyzed phosphotransferase system. show additional catabolic flux tricarboxylic acid cycle catalyzed PEP carboxykinase. contrast normal role gluconeogenesis, PEP carboxykinase operate reverse direction PEP oxaloacetate upon knockout pyruvate kinase riboflavin-producing B. subtilis strain wild-type 168. least industrial strain, demonstrate additional capacity PEP carboxykinase function substitute anaplerotic reaction normal pyruvate carboxylase inactivated. Presumably consequence unfavorable kinetics ATP-synthesizing anaplerotic PEP carboxykinase reaction, pyruvate carboxylase mutants grow slowly or, case wild-type 168, all.
