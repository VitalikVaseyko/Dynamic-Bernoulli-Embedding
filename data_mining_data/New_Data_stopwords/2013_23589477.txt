 Characteristics many tumor types reprogramming metabolism occurrence regional hypoxia. work, investigated hypothesis metabolic reprogramming combination metabolic zonation cellular energy metabolism important factors promotion growth capacity solid tumors. tissue-scale model two main ATP delivering pathways, glycolysis (GLY) oxidative phosphorylation (OXP), used simulate energy metabolism within solid tumors various metabolic strategies. Remarkably, despite high diversity usage glucose, lactate oxygen various spatial regions, tumor whole clearly displays hallmark so-called Warburg effect, i.e. high rate glucose consumption lactate production presence sufficiently high levels oxygen. simulations suggest increase GLY capacity concomitant decrease OXP capacity periphery towards center tumor improves availability oxygen pericentral tumor cells. found relationship regional oxygen level relative share GLY OXP capacities supports view metabolite availability functions key regulator tumor energy metabolism.
