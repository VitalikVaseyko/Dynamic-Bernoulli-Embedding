 Lysophosphatidic acid pleiotropic lipid signaling molecule evokes broad array cellular responses including proliferation, tumor cell invasion, neurite retraction, cytoskeletal rearrangements smooth muscle contraction. Generally, lysophosphatidic acid triggers physiological responses interaction specific plasma membrane receptors called LPA 1-4. is, however, increasing evidence support intracellular proteins interact LPA. employed Affigel-immobilized LPA isolate cytoplasmic proteins interact lysophospholipid. Among proteins retained affinity matrix, pyruvate kinase, clathrin heavy chain heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) identified mass spectrometry. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed pyruvate kinase contains one binding site LPA (Ka approx. 10(6) M(-1)). Furthermore, LPA dissociates enzymatically active pyruvate-kinase tetramers less active dimers, maximally active concentrations close critical micelle concentration. effects mimicked lysophospholipids. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed pyruvate kinase interacts clathrin, confocal imaging revealed co-localization clathrin pyruvate kinase perinuclear region cells. data suggest pyruvate kinase partly exists complex clathrin subcellular membranous areas, locally increased LPA levels trigger inactivation metabolic enzyme.
