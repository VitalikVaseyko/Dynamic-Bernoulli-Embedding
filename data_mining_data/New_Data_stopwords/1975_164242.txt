 1) activities 16 enzymes glycolysis glutathione metabolism determined intact human red cell membranes (ghosts) prepared hypotonic hemolysis. 2) Enzymes hemoglobin ghosts resolved two toluene extractions. four enzymes hexokinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase could released completely ghosts. 3) residual membrane fraction, obtained toluene extraction ghosts prepared 30 imOsM, contained 0.02% original hemoglobin content red cell. 6.5 23% hemolysate activities glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase fructose-bisphosphate aldolase detected fraction mechanical disruption. 4) Sonication intact ghosts increased activities fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, pyruvate kinase phosphoglycerate kinase. 5) "white" ghosts prepared 5 imOsM phosphate buffer contained 0.5% original hemoglobin activities fructose-bisphosphate aldolase glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase detected high levels. activities pyruvate kinase phosphoglycerate kinase low preparations. 6) results indicate one part enzymes loosely attached inner surface membrane hemoglobin. second part, "cryptic enzyme activity", available resolving toluene. residual part four enzymes firmly bound membrane. Two (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase) oriented toward inner surface membrane, whereas pyruvate kinase phosphoglycerate kinase hidden lipid core membrane.
