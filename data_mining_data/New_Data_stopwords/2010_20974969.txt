 DDS, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, common drug prescribed treat Hansen disease patients. addition antibacterial activity, DDS reported involved cellular processes occur eukaryotic cells. DDS treatment significantly enhances antioxidant activity humans, examined effect lifespan extension. show DDS extends organismic lifespan using Caenorhabditis elegans model system. DDS treatment caused delay aging decreased levels mitochondrial complex. oxygen consumption rate also significantly lowered. Consistent data, paraquat treatment evoked less reactive oxygen species DDS-treated worms, worms less sensitive paraquat. Interestingly enough, molecular events caused DDS treatment consistently reproduced mice treated DDS 3 mo C2C12 muscle cell line. Structural prediction identified pyruvate kinase (PK) protein target DDS. Indeed, DDS bound inhibited PK vitro inhibited vivo, PK mutation conferred extended lifespan C. elegans. Supplement pyruvate media protected C2C12 cells apoptosis caused paraquat. findings establish significance DDS lowering reactive oxygen species generation extending lifespan, renders rationale examining possible effect DDS human lifespan extension.
