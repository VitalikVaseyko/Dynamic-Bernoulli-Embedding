 ATPase rate kinesin isolated bovine brain method S.A. Kuznetsov V.I. Gelfand [(1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 8530-8534)] stimulated 1000-fold interaction tubulin (turnover rate per 120-kDa peptide increases approximately equal 0.009 sec-1 9 sec-1). tubulin-stimulated reaction exhibits extra incorporation water-derived oxygens wide range ATP tubulin concentrations, indicating Pi release faster reversal hydrolysis. ADP release, however, slow basal reaction release rate limiting indicated tight ADP binding (Ki less 5 nM), retention stoichiometric level bound ADP ion-exchange chromatography dialysis, reversible labeling bound ADP [14C]ATP steady-state ATPase rate shown centrifuge gel filtration inaccessibility pyruvate kinase. Tubulin accelerates release bound ADP consistent activation net ATPase reaction. detailed kinetics ADP release presence tubulin biphasic indicating apparent heterogeneity fraction kinesin active sites unaffected tubulin.
