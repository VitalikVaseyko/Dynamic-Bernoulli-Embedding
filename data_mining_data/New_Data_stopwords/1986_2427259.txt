 Using enzymes terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.31) polynucleotide phosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.8), constructed polyriboadenylic acid tracts, approximately 8000 AMP residues long, attached 3'-terminus synthetic deoxynucleotide. polyadenylated DNA, termed "signal strand", used displacement-type nucleic acid probe assay (see pp 1631-6, issue). probe-signal strand complex made hybridizing signal strand deoxycytidylate-terminal probe DNA. probe-signal strand complex immobilized oligo (dG)-cellulose support subsequently displaced immobilized hybrid complex various amounts analyte DNA. displacement procedure, polyadenylate tracts converted ATP combined action polynucleotide phosphorylase pyruvate kinase. ATP quantified bioluminescence assay luciferase Photinus pyralis. Displacement events also quantified biotinylated signal strand bound avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. enzyme-amplified assays offer considerable versatility: may coupled variety detection systems including colorimetry, fluorimetry, luminometry.
