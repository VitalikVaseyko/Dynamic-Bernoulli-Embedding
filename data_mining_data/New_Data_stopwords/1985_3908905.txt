 determine major isoenzymes pyruvate kinase pancreatic islet pyruvate kinase resembled, compared pyruvate kinase tissues kinetic immunologic studies. pattern activation fructose bisphosphate patterns inhibition alanine phenylalanine similar M2 isoenzyme kidney dissimilar isoenzymes skeletal muscle (type M1) liver (type L). islet pyruvate kinase inhibited anti-M1 pyruvate kinase serum (which crossreacts M2 isoenzyme), anti-L pyruvate kinase. results consistent islets possessing predominantly, exclusively, M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase. previously showed rat pancreatic islet cytosol contains protein kinases catalyze calcium-activated phosphorylation endogenous peptide properties, subunit molecular weight isoelectric pH, identical M2 M1 isoenzymes pyruvate kinase, islet cytosol catalyze phosphorylation muscle pyruvate kinase. present study shown incubating islet cytosol ATP conditions known permit phosphorylation inhibition liver pyruvate kinase affect islet pyruvate kinase activity. concluded phosphorylation islet pyruvate kinase immediate effect enzyme activity.
