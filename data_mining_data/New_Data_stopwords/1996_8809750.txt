 report cloning determination nucleotide sequence gene encoding nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. amino acid sequence Ndk highly homologous known bacterial eukaryotic Ndks (39.9 58.3% amino acid identity). previously reported P. aeruginosa strains mutations genes algR2 algR2 algH produce extremely low levels Ndk and, consequence, defective ability grow presence Tween 20, detergent inhibits kinase substitute Ndk. Hyperexpression ndk clone pGWS95 trans P. aeruginosa algR2 algR2 algH double mutant restored Ndk production levels equalled exceeded wild-type levels enabled strains grow presence Tween 20. Hyperexpression ndk pGWS95 P. aeruginosa algR2 mutant also restored alginate production levels approximately 60% wild type. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity present cytosolic membrane-associated fractions P. aeruginosa. cytosolic Ndk non-specific transfer activity terminal phosphate ATP nucleoside diphosphates. However, membrane form Ndk active transfer terminal phosphate ATP GDP resulting predominant formation GTP. report work pyruvate kinase Ndk form complex alters specificity Ndk substantially GTP. significance GTP signal transduction events within cell production GDP-mannose, essential alginate precursor, clearly indicates importance Ndk cellular processes well alginate synthesis.
