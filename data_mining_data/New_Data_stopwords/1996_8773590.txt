 human activation antigen CD69 early inducible surface glycoprotein acquired cells thymus stage positive selection activation mature lymphoid cells vivo vitro. studied regulatory influence CD69 activation pathway glycolytic process transduction signals thymocytes. Treatment human thymocytes different anti-CD69 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), presence submitogenic doses phorbol ester, produced enhanced release lactate without significant alterations Fru 2,6-P2 levels phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2) pyruvate kinase activities. small increase phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) activity also detected. Furthermore, anti-CD69 mAb increased glucose detritiation [2-3H] [3-3H]glucose, thus indicating enhanced flux hexokinase PFK-1 steps. addition, de novo synthesis diacylglycerol intracellular Ca2+ levels increased anti-CD69 mAb treatment. stimulatory effects anti-CD69 mAb glycolysis Ca2+ levels inhibited cyclosporin A. CD69 molecules present certain subset populations immature thymocytes, ability anti-CD69 mAb stimulate glycolysis, synthesis diacylglycerol intracellular Ca2+ levels suggest activation signals delivered CD69 molecules could play role thymus cells maturation.
