 Longevity accumulation multiple context-dependent signaling pathways long-standing inflammation (antigen-load oxidative stress) results decreased/altered regulation immunity loss control switch mechanisms defined Yin Yang acute inflammation immune surveillance. Chronic inflammation initiated immune disruptors-induced progressive changes physiology function susceptible host tissues lead increased immune suppression multistep disease processes including carcinogenesis. interrelated multiple hypotheses presented first time article extension author's earlier series 'accidental' discoveries role inflammation developmental stages immune dysfunction toward tumorigenesis angiogenesis. Detailed analyses data chronic diseases suggest nearly age-associated illnesses, generally categorized 'mild' (e.g., increased allergies), 'moderate' (e.g., hypertension, colitis, gastritis, pancreatitis, emphysema) 'severe' (e.g., accelerated neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases site-specific cancers metastasis) variations hypersensitivity responses tissues manifested different diseases immune-responsive immune-privileged tissues. Continuous release/presence low level histamine (subclinical) circulation could contribute sustained oxidative stress induction 'mild' 'moderate' 'severe' (immune tsunami) immune disorders susceptible tissues. Site-specific cancers proposed 'severe' (irreversible) forms cumulative delayed hypersensitivity responses would induce immunological chaos favor tissue growth target tissues. Shared special features growth fetus development adulthood aging processes carcinogenesis briefly compared regard energy requirements highly complex function Yin Yang. Features Yang (growth-promoting) arm acute inflammation fetus cancer growth compared consuming low energy glycolysis (Warburg effect). Growth fetus cancer cells hypoxic conditions impaired mitochondrial energy requirements tissues including metabolism essential branched amino acids (e.g., val, leu, isoleu) compared proposing working model future systematic research cancer biology, prevention therapy. Presentation working model provides insightful clues bioenergetics required fetus growth (absence external threat lack high energy-demands Yin events parasite-like survival host), normal growth adulthood (balance Yin Yang processes) disease processes carcinogenesis (loss balance Yin-Yang).
