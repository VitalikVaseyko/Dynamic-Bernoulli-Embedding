 Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA), product hepatic metabolism widely used anticancer drug ifosfamide (IFO), reported decrease cancer cell proliferation. basis effect completely known attributed drop cellular ATP content. Given importance glucose metabolism 'Warburg effect' cancer cells, examined present study ability CAA inhibit cancer cell proliferation altering glycolytic pathway. Cell proliferation, ATP content, glucose transport metabolism well activities main enzymes glycolysis determined human breast cancer cells MCF-7 presence various CAA concentrations (5-50 microm). results show low CAA concentrations inhibited cell proliferation concentration-dependent manner. inhibition explained decrease glucose utilization. Cellular ATP content reduced even increased 25 microm CAA. inhibition glucose metabolism mainly explained decrease glucose transport hexokinase activity. activity glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, also inhibited. Glycolysis inhibition CAA effective decreasing proliferation MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, decrease due ATP depletion; rather, linked drop biosynthetic precursors glycolytic intermediates. CAA-induced inhibition cell proliferation suggests might play role antitumor activity IFO.
