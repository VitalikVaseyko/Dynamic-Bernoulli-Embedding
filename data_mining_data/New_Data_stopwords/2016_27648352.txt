 GLUT1, lesser extent, GLUT3, appear interesting targets treatment glioblastoma multiforme. current review aims give brief history scientific community's understanding glucose transporters relate importance metabolic changes occur result cancer. One primary changes occurs cancer, Warburg Effect, characterized extreme shift toward glycolysis usual reliance oxidative phosphorylation currently investigated target upstream downstream factors responsible Warburg-induced changes. Further, aims explain differential expression GLUT1 GLUT3 glioblastoma tissue, modulations expression serve targets restore normal metabolism. Additionally, hypoxia-induced factor-1alpha's (HIF1alpha) role number transcriptional changes typical GBM discussed, including role GLUT upregulation. Finally, four known subtypes GBM [proneural, neural, mesenchymal, classical] characterized order discuss metabolic changes differ subtype. changes potential selectively targeted order provide specificity clinical treatment options GBM.
