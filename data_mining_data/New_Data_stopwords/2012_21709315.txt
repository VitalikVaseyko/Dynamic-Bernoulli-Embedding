 Cancer cells feature altered glucose metabolism allows rapid growth. consume large amounts glucose produce lactate, even presence ample oxygen, known Warburg effect. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) contributes Warburg effect previously unknown mechanisms. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) mediates PKM2 gene transcription glucose reprogramming cancer cells. recent discovery novel physical functional interactions PKM2 HIF-1 cancer cells provided insight molecular mechanisms underlying Warburg effect.
