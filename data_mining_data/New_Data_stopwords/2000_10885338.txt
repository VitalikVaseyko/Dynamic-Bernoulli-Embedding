Neurological examination revealed normal muscle strength extremities except marked back muscle weakness. normal intelligence. laboratory examination, serum AST, ALT, LDH, aldolase, CK myoglobin levels elevated. lactate pyruvate levels normally responded ischemic exercises test. Acid maltase activity normal white blood cells. muscle biopsy obtained rectus femoris muscle revealed vacuolar myopathy mildly increased PAS positive material. electron microscopy, autophagic vacuoles scavenging glycogen particles cytoplasmic debris, sarcolemmal indentation, compatible findings lysosomal glycogen storage disease normal acid maltase. patient unusual clinical features absent mental retardation apparent cardiomyopathy. Accordingly, mental retardation probably necessary see later onset cardiac muscle involvement.
