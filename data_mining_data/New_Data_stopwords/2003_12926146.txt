 OBJECTIVE: M2-pyruvate kinase isoenzyme (M2-PK) expressed undifferentiated proliferating tissue. aim study establish diagnostic role tumor M2-PK (TM2-PK) patients neuroendocrine tumors compare diagnostic value chromogranin (CgA) well-established. MATERIALS METHODS: Forty-nine patients proven neuroendocrine tumors divided follows: subgroup (17 patients tumor surgically removed), subgroup B (9 patients neoplasm without metastases) subgroup C (23 patients tumor distant metastases). Twenty-four healthy subjects also studied controls. Plasma TM2-PK CgA measured using ELISA techniques. RESULTS: TM2-PK concentrations (cut-off value 5.6 U/mL) abnormally high 25.0% healthy subjects, 41.2% patients subgroup A, 66.7% subgroup B 78.3% subgroup C. CgA concentrations (cut-off value 5.0 U/L) normal healthy subjects, whereas abnormally high 76.5% patients subgroup A, 88.9% subgroup B 95.7% subgroup C. CONCLUSION: Since TM2-PK sensitivity similar CgA specificity significantly lower (p = 0.031), seems limited value detecting neuroendocrine tumors.
