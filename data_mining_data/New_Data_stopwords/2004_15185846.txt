 alcoholic extract latex obtained Calotropis procera (Asclepidaceae) evaluated protection isoproterenol (20 mg/100 g body wt., s.c.)-induced myocardial infarction albino rats. heart damage induced isoproterenol indicated elevated levels marker enzymes Creatine Kinase-isoenzyme (CK-MB), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Serum Glutamate Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) Serum Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) serum increased lipid peroxide reduced glutathione content heart homogenates. Microscopical examination (histopathology) also performed myocardial tissue. Pretreatment ethanolic latex extract Calotropis procera dose 300 mg/kg body wt., administered orally thrice day 30 days, reduced significantly (p < 0.01) elevated marker enzyme levels serum heart homogenates isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. Histopathological observation revealed marked protection extract myocardial necrotic damage.
