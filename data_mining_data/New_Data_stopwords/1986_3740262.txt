 loss [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) binding following high-energy radiation used compare muscarinic receptor size single smooth muscle cells isolated collagenase digestion canine stomach plasma membranes derived intact gastric smooth muscle without exposure exogenous proteolysis. Radiation inactivation galactose oxidase (68 kdaltons), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (160 kdaltons), pyruvate kinase (224 kdaltons) activities used molecular-weight standards. Radiation inactivation [3H]QNB binding rat brain membranes, gave target size 86 kdaltons, served additional control. isolated smooth muscle cells, calculated size muscarinic receptor 80 +/- 8 kdaltons. contrast, smooth muscle enriched plasma membrane preparation, muscarinic receptor size significantly smaller 45 +/- 3 kdaltons. Larger molecular sizes obtained either presence protease inhibitors (62 +/- 4 kdaltons) using crude membrane preparation gastric smooth muscle 86 +/- 7 kdaltons).
