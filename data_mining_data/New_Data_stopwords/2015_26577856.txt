 Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) sixth common human malignancy. According World Health Organization, oral cancer reported highest morbidity mortality survival rate approximately 50 % 5 years diagnosis. attributed subjectivity TNM staging histological grading may result less optimum treatment outcomes including tumour recurrence. One hallmarks cancer aerobic glycolysis also known Warburg effect. glycolytic phenotype (hypoxic state) confers immortality cancer cells, also correlates belligerent behaviour various malignancies reflected increase expression lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH-5), main isoform LDH catalysing conversion pyruvate lactate glycolysis. diagnostic role salivary LDH assessing metabolic phenotype oral cancer studied. Since salivary LDH mainly sourced oral epithelial cells, pathological changes epithelium reflect diagnostically saliva. Thus current research, made attempt ascertain biological behaviour aggressiveness OSCC appraising metabolic phenotype indirectly reflected salivary LDH activity. found salivary LDH used assess aggressiveness different histological grades OSCC. first time, evidence differing metabolic behaviour similar histologic tumour grade presented. Taken together, study examines inclusion salivary LDH potential diagnostic parameter therapeutic index OSCC.
