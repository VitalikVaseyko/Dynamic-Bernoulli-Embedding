 Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) morphologically biologically distinct subtype ovarian carcinomas often arises ovarian endometriosis. previously reported unique carcinogenic environment, especially iron-induced oxidative stress endometriotic cysts may promote development OCCC. also identified gene expression profile characteristic OCCC (the "OCCC signature"). 320-gene OCCC signature enriched genes associated stress response sugar metabolism. However, biological implication profile unclear. study, focused biological role HNF-1beta gene within OCCC signature, previously shown overexpressed OCCC. Suppression HNF-1beta HNF-1beta-overexpressing human ovarian cancer cell line RMG2 using short hairpin RNA resulted significant increase proliferation. also facilitated glucose uptake, glycolytic activity, lactate secretion along increased expression glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) gene several key enzymes glycolytic process. Conversely, forced expression HNF-1beta serous ovarian cancer cell line, Hey, resulted slowed cellular growth repressed glycolytic activity. data suggest HNF-1beta represses cell growth, time, promotes aerobic glycolysis known "Warburg effect." Warburg effect regarded characteristic metabolic process cancer may contribute cell survival hypoxic conditions stressful environment, overexpression HNF-1beta may play inevitable role occurrence OCCC stressful environment.
