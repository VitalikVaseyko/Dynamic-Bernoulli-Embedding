 showed previously rat branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) kinase capable autophosphorylation. However, despite sequence similarity bacterial histidine protein kinases, BCKD kinase function histidine protein kinase. present study, report rat BCKD kinase exists homotetramer M(r) = 185,000, based results gel filtration dynamic light scattering. contrast related mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozymes occur homodimers. tetrameric assembly BCKD kinase confirmed presence four 5'-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate-binding sites (K(D) = 4.1 x 10(-6)m) per molecule kinase. Incubation BCKD kinase increasing concentrations urea resulted dissociation tetramer dimers eventually monomers separated sucrose density gradient. tetramers dimers, monomer, maintained conformation capable binding ATP undergoing autophosphorylation. BCKD kinase depends fully lipoylated transacylase maximal activity, interaction kinase transacylase impeded presence high salt concentrations. Alterations conserved residues ATP-binding domain led marked reduction complete loss catalytic efficiency BCKD kinase. results indicate BCKD kinase, similar pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozymes, belongs superfamily ATPase/kinase.
