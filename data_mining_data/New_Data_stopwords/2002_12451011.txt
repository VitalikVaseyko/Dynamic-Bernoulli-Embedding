 BACKGROUND: Previous studies examined acute effects enhanced glucose oxidation postischemic myocardium. goal present study examine prolonged functional recovery subsequent postischemic, intracoronary pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibition dichloroacetate (DCA) stunned myocardium conscious pigs. METHODS RESULTS: Myocardial stunning induced conscious pigs coronary stenosis, ie, 40% reduction coronary blood flow 90 minutes, followed full reperfusion. initial peak, early reactive hyperemia (5 minutes reperfusion), 1 hour intracoronary infusion 20% measured coronary blood flow begun using 20 mmol/L [2-(13)C]glucose without (n=4) (n=5) 20 mmol/L DCA. Coronary stenosis resulted similar reduction wall thickening untreated (-53+/-3% 3.27+/-0.22 mm, n=9) DCA (-51+/-3% 3.08+/-0.15 mm, n=5) groups. reperfusion, DCA increased glucose oxidation 10-fold. absence DCA, myocardial stunning observed; ie, wall thickening reduced 48+/-3% 1 hour reperfusion fully recover 48 hours. contrast, DCA pigs, myocardial stunning ameliorated (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Transient metabolic intervention within clinically relevant time ischemia eliminates myocardial stunning conscious pigs augmented carbohydrate oxidation provides sustained benefits contractile recovery.
