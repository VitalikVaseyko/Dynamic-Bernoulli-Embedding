 Aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect contributes cancer cell proliferation; however, glucose metabolism pathway precisely regulated remains elusive. show receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), cell death survival signaling factor, regulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis. Loss RIP1 lung cancer cells suppressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) expression, impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation accelerating glycolysis, resulting spontaneous DNA damage p53-mediated cell proliferation inhibition. Thus, although aerobic glycolysis within certain range favors cancer cell proliferation, excessive glycolysis causes cytostasis. data suggest maintenance glycolysis RIP1 pivotal cancer cell energy homeostasis DNA integrity may exploited use anticancer therapy.
