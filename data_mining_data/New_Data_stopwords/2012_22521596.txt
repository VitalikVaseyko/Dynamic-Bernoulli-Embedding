 photosynthesis, cyanobacteria, algae plants fix carbon dioxide (CO(2)) carbohydrates; necessary support life Earth. 50 years ago, Otto Heinrich Warburg discovered unique stimulatory role CO(2) Hill reaction (i.e., O(2) evolution accompanied reduction artificial electron acceptor), which, obviously, include carbon fixation pathway; Warburg used discovery support idea O(2) photosynthesis originates CO(2). 1960s, large number researchers attempted decipher unique phenomenon, limited success. 1970s, Alan Stemler, Govindjee's lab, perfected methods get highly reproducible results, observed, among things, turnover Photosystem II (PSII) stimulated bicarbonate ions (hydrogen carbonate): effect would donor acceptor, sides PSII. 1975, Thomas Wydrzynski, also Govindjee's lab, discovered definite bicarbonate effect electron acceptor (the plastoquinone) side PSII. recent 1.9A crystal structure PSII, unequivocally shows HCO(3)(-) bound non-heme iron sits in-between bound primary quinone electron acceptor, Q(A), secondary quinone electron acceptor Q(B). review, focus historical development understanding unique bicarbonate effect electron acceptor side PSII, mechanism obtained biochemical, biophysical molecular biological approaches many laboratories around World. suggest atomic level model HCO(3)(-)/CO(3)(2-) plays key role protonation reduced Q(B). addition, make comments role bicarbonate donor side PSII, extensively studied labs Alan Stemler (USA) Vyacheslav Klimov (Russia). end review discussing uniqueness bicarbonate's role oxygenic photosynthesis role evolutionary development O(2)-evolving PSII. article part Special Issue entitled: Photosynthesis Research Sustainability: Natural Artificial.
