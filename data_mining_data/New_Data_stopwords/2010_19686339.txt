 Yeasts evolved numerous responsive pathways survive fluctuating stressful environments. endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sensitive adverse conditions, detected response pathways ensure correct protein folding. Calnexin ER transmembrane chaperone acting quality control folding response persistent stress. Calnexin key protein required viability certain organisms mammals fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Nevertheless, S. pombe calnexin-independent (Cin) cells obtained transient expression particular calnexin mutant. Cin state dominant, stably propagated epigenetic mechanism segregates non-Mendelian fashion meiotic progeny. nucleolar protein Cif1p identified inducer Cin state previous genetic screen. Here, report identification novel inducers isolated overexpression genetic screen: pyruvate kinase (Pyk1p) phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p). Addition pyruvate, end product pyruvate kinase glycolysis, also induced calnexin independence dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, growth respiration media cold temperatures induced appearance Cin cells high frequencies. Taken together, results indicate Cin state triggered extracellular changes, suggesting state represents epigenetic adaptative response environmental modifications.
