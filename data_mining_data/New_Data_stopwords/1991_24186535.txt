 interactions carbon nitrogen metabolism cotyledons germinating Ricinus communis L. seedlings investigated. endosperm removed 6-d-old seedlings cotyledons supplied 50 mM glucose mM potassium phosphate without nitrogen source, supplemented 10 mM glutamine 5 mM NH4Cl. [U(14)C] Glucose labelling patterns used investigate effect fluxes. Addition glutamine NH4Cl led 3.5- 5-fold increase labelling amino acids (most exported) increased (14)CO2 release. Glutamine also led stimulation glucose uptake, sucrose synthesis export. Measurements metabolites showed glutamine NH4Cl led decrease a-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, glycerate-2-phosphate glycerate-3-phosphate, small increase triose-phosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, small decrease hexose-phosphate (in case glutamine), increase UDP glucose. treatments, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate doubled, inorganic pyrophosphate decreased slightly. Similar results obtained detached cotyledons, except glutamine alter rate glucose uptake sucrose synthesis. increased rate sucrose synthesis supplying glutamine intact seedlings ascribed increased rate sucrose export cotyledons due enhanced water flow phloem, brought loading glutamine. doubling rate glycolysis adding glutamine NH4Cl intact seedlings excised cotyledons ascribed activation terminal enzymes glycolysis, pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. resulting decrease phosphoenolpyruvate glycerate-3-phosphate leads activation phosphofructokinase. also relieves inhibition fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase, leading increased fructose-2,6-bisphosphate activation pyrophosphate; fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase.
