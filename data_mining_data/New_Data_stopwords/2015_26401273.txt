 BACKGROUND: Glucose metabolism links metabolic status protein acetylation. However, remains poorly understood extent features glucose metabolism contribute protein acetylation whether process dynamically quantitatively regulated differing rates glycolysis. RESULTS: Here, show titratable rates glycolysis corresponding changes levels glycolytic intermediates result graded remodeling bulk metabolome resulted gradual changes total histone acetylation levels. Dynamic histone acetylation levels found strongly correlated acetyl coenzyme (ac-CoA) levels inversely associated ratio ac-CoA free CoA. multiplexed stable isotopic labeling amino acids cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics approach revealed levels half identified histone acetylation sites well lysine acylation modifications tuned rate glycolysis demonstrating glycolytic rate affects specific acylation sites. CONCLUSIONS: demonstrate histone acylation directly sensed glucose flux titratable, dose-dependent manner modulated glycolytic flux possible function Warburg Effect, metabolic state observed cancers enhanced glucose metabolism, confer specific signaling effects cells.
