 Changes profile two glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, different regions rat brain studied alloxan-induced diabetes. regional variation effect diabetes brain noted - cerebral hemispheres cerebellum showed decreased activity enzymes, brain stem remained relatively unaffected. changes enzyme activities brain regions pronounced early days diabetes, particularly 8 days. Insulin administration diabetic animals restored activity enzymes. results indicate regionally variable effect diabetes two key glycolytic enzymes, bring role insulin regulation brain glycolysis.
