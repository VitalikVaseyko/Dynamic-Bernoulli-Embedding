 structure temporal expression two Xenopus cDNAs encoding beta subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase (XPdhE1 beta) determined. XPdhE1 beta 88% homologous mature human PdhE1 beta, putative N-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide poorly conserved. Zygotic expression XPdhE1 beta mRNA detected neural tube closure increased stage 40. RT-PCR cloning identified short homology protein kinase open reading frame within 3' non-coding sequence XPdhE1 beta cDNAs. homology, occurred antisense cDNA strand, shown strand specific RT-PCR transcribed vivo part antisense RNA. Northern analysis showed RNA formed part abundant heterogeneous population antisense sense poly(A)-RNAs transcribed XPdhE1 beta loci coordinately regulated message production.
