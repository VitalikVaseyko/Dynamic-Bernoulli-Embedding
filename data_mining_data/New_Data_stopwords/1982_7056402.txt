 Although classical pathways gluconeogenesis well understood, alone account rate incorporation isotopes labeled precursors glucose distribution isotopes within glucose molecule. Additional factors include rate glycerol metabolism relative rate triosephosphate isomerase, isotope dilution Krebs cycle, equilibration fumarase reaction, flux pyruvate dehydrogenase, recycling via pyruvate kinase. importance latter two reactions greatest gluconeogenetic flux low.
