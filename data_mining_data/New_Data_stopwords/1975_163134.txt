 activity following enzymes studied normal, precancerous, malignant biopsies human cervix uteri: hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate-kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH). precancerous conditions, i.e., dysplasia carcinoma situ without signs invasive carcinoma, PK showed moderate significant activity increases. rise enzyme activity biopsies histologically classified carcinoma situ found signal presence invasive carcinoma parts cervix. invasive carcinomas cervix, enzymes studied showed two- four-fold increase (p less 0.01) compared normal cervix. present study failed reveal significant differences enzyme activities biopsies patients Stage I, II, III; correlation could established enzyme activity prognosis.
