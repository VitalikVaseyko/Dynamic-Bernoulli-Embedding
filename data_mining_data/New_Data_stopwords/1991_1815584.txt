 Using essentially two-step procedure involving phosphocellulose column chromatography followed gel filtration Sephadex G200, pig heart pyruvate kinase (PH PyK) purified 267-fold least 97% purity. PH PyK co-sedimented rabbit muscle PyK sucrose density ultracentrifugation yielding S20,w 10 corresponding molecular weight 237,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded subunit molecular weight approximately 59,000, suggesting native PH PyK exists tetramer. isoelectric point (pI) determined 8.2, pH optimum (pHo) forward reaction 7.2. Steady-state kinetics phospho(enol)pyruvate (PEP) variable substrate show threefold decrease Km PEP presence 1.0 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP), activity PH PyK increased fourfold FDP low (0.1 mM) PEP concentrations. Lineweaver-Burk plots linear presence absence FDP, indicating Michaelis-Menten curves hyperbolic. amino acid composition pig heart PyK shows close similarities pig muscle kidney PyKs, liver PyK. Among data pI, pHo, FDP activation, activation FDP useful tentatively designating pig heart PyK M2 isozyme.
