 OBJECTIVES: Warburg effect, switch aerobic energy production anaerobic glycolysis, promotes tumour proliferation motility inducing acidification tumour microenvironment. Therapies reduce acidity could impair tumour growth invasiveness. analysed dynamics cell proliferation resistance therapies target acidity, population cells, Warburg effect. MATERIALS METHODS: dynamics mutant cells increased glycolysis motility assessed multi-player game collective interactions framework evolutionary game theory. Perturbations level acidity microenvironment used simulate effect therapies target glycolysis. RESULTS: non-linear effects glycolysis induce frequency-dependent clonal selection leading coexistence glycolytic non-glycolytic cells within tumour. Mutants increased motility invade polymorphic population spread within tumour. reducing acidity may produce sudden reduction tumour cell proliferation, frequency-dependent selection enables adapt new conditions enable tumour restore original levels growth invasiveness. CONCLUSIONS: acidity produced glycolysis acts non-linear public good leads coexistence cells high low glycolysis within tumour. heterogeneous population easily adapt changes acidity. Therapies target acidity effective long term cost glycolysis high, is, non-limiting oxygen concentrations. efficacy, therefore, reduced combined therapies impair angiogenesis.
