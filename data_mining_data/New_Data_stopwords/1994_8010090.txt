 Echinococcus granulosus cyst wall exhibited activities fumarate hydratase (FH), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) 911-1433, 151-215, 54-98U, respectively. ratio PK/PEPCK 2.2-2.7, indicating glycolysis main pathway carbohydrate metabolism cyst wall. infected mice treated ig mebendazole, albendazole praziquantel respective daily dose 25-50, 300, 500 mg.kg-1 7-14 d, apparent change FH activity cyst wall found, PK PEPCK activities cyst wall markedly inhibited mebendazole albendazole. inhibition rates PK PEPCK activities mebendazole group 85-88% 90-92%, respectively, albendazole group 55.3 71.6%, respectively. results suggest PK PEPCK cyst wall may important site attacked effective anti-hydatid drugs.
