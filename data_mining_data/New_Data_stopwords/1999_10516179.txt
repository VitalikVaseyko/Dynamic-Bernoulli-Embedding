 purpose report describe mRNA abundance glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase ischemic adjacent aerobic myocardium. Mechanical, metabolic, mRNA data acquired pig model regulated coronary flow using extracorporeal perfusion. Trials coronary hypoperfusion included sustained intermittent exposures acute ischemia without reperfusion. compared chronic 4-day model partial coronary stenosis. ischemic tissues, levels mRNA, normalized mRNA beta-actin, increased control values GAPDH (range 2.7- 4.6-fold), pyruvate kinase (2.9-fold), pyruvate dehydrogenase (2.1-fold). interest increases mRNA levels control values also observed adjacent aerobic heart muscle intervention hearts, including 3.6- 4.5-fold elevations message GAPDH 2.1-fold increase signal pyruvate dehydrogenase. Augmentation mRNA abundance occurred short time 40 min ischemia maintained long 4 days partial coronary stenosis. Whether former time interval sufficient affect protein production problematic, latter time ample influence enzyme concentration, may turn regulated glycolysis condition.
