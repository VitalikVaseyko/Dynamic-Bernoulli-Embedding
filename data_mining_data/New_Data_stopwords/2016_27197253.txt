 B7-H3 member B7 family immunoregulatory transmembrane glycoproteins expressed cells. B7-H3 overexpression associated poor outcomes multiple cancers, also immune-independent roles outside cells precise mechanistic contributions cancer unclear. study, investigated role B7-H3 metabolic reprogramming cancer cells vitro vivo found B7-H3 promoted Warburg effect, evidenced increased glucose uptake lactate production B7-H3-expressing cells. B7-H3 also increased protein levels HIF1alpha downstream targets, LDHA PDK1, key enzymes glycolytic pathway. Furthermore, B7-H3 promoted reactive oxygen species-dependent stabilization HIF1alpha suppressing activity stress-activated transcription factor Nrf2 target genes, including antioxidants SOD1, SOD2, PRX3. Metabolic imaging human breast cancer xenografts mice confirmed B7-H3 enhanced tumor glucose uptake tumor growth. Together, results illuminate critical immune-independent contributions B7-H3 cancer metabolism, presenting radically new perspective B7 family immunoregulatory proteins malignant progression.
