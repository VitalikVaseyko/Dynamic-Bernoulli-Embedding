 WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) functions tumour suppressor oral carcinogenesis. aberrant TMEM207 expression may lead tumour progression hampering tumour suppressor function WWOX various cancers, explored expression pathobiological properties TMEM207, focusing WWOX-mediated regulation HIF-1alpha pathway oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). TMEM207 immunoreactivity detected 40 90 OSCC samples neighbouring non-tumorous epithelial tissues. Moreover, TMEM207 expression significantly correlated lymph node metastasis poor prognosis. situ proximal ligation assay demonstrated colocalization TMEM207 WWOX invasive OSCC cells, especially glycogen-rich ones. Enforced expression TMEM207 abrogated binding WWOX HIF-1alpha, increased HIF-1alpha GLUT-1 expression, even normoxic conditions, promoted tumour growth xenoplant assay using SAS tongue squamous cancer cells. contrast, TMEM207 knockdown decreased GLUT-1 expression two OSCC cell lines. whole, findings indicate aberrant expression TMEM207 contributes tumour progression OSCC, possibly via promoting aerobic glycolysis.
