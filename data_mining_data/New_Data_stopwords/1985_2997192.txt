 interactions ATP, monovalent cations, divalent cations rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase examined using 7Li, 31P, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. Water proton nuclear relaxation studies consistent binding Li+ K+ site pyruvate kinase affinity 120 mM absence substrates 16 mM presence P-enolpyruvate. Titrations pyruvate demonstrate pyruvate binds enzyme affinity 0.65 mM presence Li+ 0.4 mM presence K+. 7Li+ nuclear relaxation rates solutions pyruvate kinase increased upon titration metal-nucleotide analogue, Cr(H2O)4ATP. Mn2+ EPR spectra used determined distribution enzyme so-called isotropic anisotropic conformations enzyme (Ash, D. E., Kayne, F., Reed, G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. (1978) 190, 571-577). Li-Cr distances 5.6 11.0 calculated anisotropic isotropic forms, respectively, absence presence pyruvate. divalent cation site enzyme saturated Mg2+, distances increased 6.7 9.5 A, respectively, regardless presence absence pyruvate. 31P nuclear relaxation studies diamagnetic metal-nucleotide analogue, Co(NH3)4ATP, indicated addition Mn2+ ion divalent cation site enzyme increased longitudinal relaxation rates three phosphorus nuclei analogue. 31P data indicate presence pyruvate active site effects decrease Mn-P distances, bringing Mn2+ Co(NH3)4ATP closer together active site. data also permit evaluation role metal coordinated beta-P gamma-P ATP active site.
