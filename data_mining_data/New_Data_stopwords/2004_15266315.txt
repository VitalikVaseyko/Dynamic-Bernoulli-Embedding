 Proliferating cells, especially tumour cells, express special isoenzyme pyruvate kinase, termed M2-PK, occur tetrameric form high affinity substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), dimeric form low PEP affinity. tumour cells, dimeric form usually predominant therefore termed Tumour M2-PK. levels Tumour M2-PK within tumours EDTA-plasma correlate staging ability tumour cells metastasise. Since colorectal tumours grow intraluminally, appeared interesting determine whether Tumour M2-PK detectable faeces tumour patients. Stool samples tested ELISA controls without colorectal cancer colorectal cancer patients. Whereas Tumour M2-PK levels low control group (mean value+/-s.e.m.: 3.3+/-0.4, n=144), high case colorectal cancer (56.1+/-15.3, n=60). cutoff value 4 U ml(-1), sensitivity 73%. TNM Dukes' classification tumours revealed strong correlation faecal Tumour M2-PK levels staging. determination Tumour M2-PK faeces provides new promising screening tool colorectal tumours.
