 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase isozymes M2 (PKM2), member pyruvate kinase family, plays role glycolytic enzyme glucose metabolism. also functions protein kinase cell proliferation, signaling, immunity, gene transcription. study, role PKM2 neuropathic pain induced chronic constriction injury (CCI) investigated. METHODS: Rats randomly grouped establish CCI models. PKM2, extracellular regulated protein kinases (EKR), p-ERK, signal transducers activators transcription (STAT3), p-STAT3, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) p-PI3K/AKT proteins expression spinal cord examined Western blot analysis. Cellular location PKM2 examined immunofluorescence. Knockdown PKM2 achieved intrathecal injection specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Von Frey filaments radiant heat tests performed determine mechanical allodynia thermal hyperalgesia respectively. Lactate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents measured specific kits. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) levels detected ELISA kits. RESULTS: CCI markedly increased PKM2 level rat spinal cord. Double immunofluorescent staining showed PKM2 co-localized neuron, astrocyte, microglia. Intrathecal injection PKM2 siRNA attenuated CCI-induced ERK STAT3 activation, also attenuated mechanical allodynia thermal hyperalgesia induced CCI. However, PKM2 siRNA failed inhibit activation AKT. addition, PKM2 siRNA significantly suppressed production lactate pro-inflammatory mediators. CONCLUSION: findings demonstrate inhibiting PKM2 expression effectively attenuates CCI-induced neuropathic pain inflammatory responses rats, possibly regulating ERK STAT3 signaling pathway.
