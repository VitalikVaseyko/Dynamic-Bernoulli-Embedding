 OBJECTIVES: Recently, growing interest mechanism action dichloroacetate (DCA) T-cell differentiation; however, mechanism elucidated detail. Therefore, study aimed investigate mechanism action DCA Treg Th17 differentiation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) inhibitor (AZD7545) PDHK knockdown. METHODS: Inhibitory activity DCA AZD7545 recombinant PDHK intracellular PDH phosphorylation measured. effects DCA AZD7545 T-cell differentiation assessed analysing Foxp3(+) T-cell populations Treg differentiation IL-17A production Th17 differentiation. reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, DCFDA used indicator. KEY FINDINGS: Dichloroacetate AZD7545 inhibited PDHK activity recombinant PDHK intracellular PDH phosphorylation. DCA capable inducing Treg differentiation suppressing Th17 differentiation. effects DCA independent PDHK neither AZD7545 knockdown PDHK1 PDHK3 affected T-cell differentiation. DCA determined capable inducing ROS production, effects DCA T-cell differentiation shown dependent ROS production. CONCLUSIONS: Dichloroacetate possesses Treg induction Th17 suppression, independent PDHK dependent ROS production.
