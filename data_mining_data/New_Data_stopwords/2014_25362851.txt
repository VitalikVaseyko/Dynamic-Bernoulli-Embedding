 Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mitochondrially localized primary antioxidant enzyme, known essential survival aerobic life important roles tumorigenesis. Here, show MnSOD deficiency skin tissues MnSOD-heterozygous knockout (Sod2(+/-)) mice leads increased expresson uncoupling proteins (UCPs). MnSOD deficient, superoxide radical resulting reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate ligand binding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), suggesting activation PPARalpha signaling major mechanism underlying MnSOD-dependent UCPs expression consequently triggers PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, leading increased aerobic glycolysis. Knockdown UCPs mTOR suppresses lactate production increases ATP levels, suggesting UCPs contribute increased glycolysis. results highlight existence free radical-mediated mechanism activates mitochondria uncoupling reduce ROS production, precedes glycolytic adaptation described Warburg Effect.
