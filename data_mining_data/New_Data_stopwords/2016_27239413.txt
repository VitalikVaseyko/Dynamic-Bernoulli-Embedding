 BACKGROUND: reported 4,4'-diamino-diphenyl sulfone (DDS), longtime treatment choice leprosy, prolongs lifespan increases mobility animal models reducing levels reactive oxygen species inhibiting muscle pyruvate kinase activity. study aimed investigate whether sarcopenic status leprosy survivors influenced recent history DDS medication. METHODS: Forty-one elderly female leprosy survivors recruited. DDS group defined survivors taking drug past year more. Body composition measured dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, limb muscle strength, short physical performance battery, International Physical Activity Questionnaire Korean compared. RESULTS: DDS group tended higher skeletal muscle mass index (24.4 +/- 2.7 vs. 22.6 +/- 2.2%, P = 0.066) regional skeletal muscle mass index non-dominant leg (8.9 +/- 1.0 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.9%, P = 0.018) control group although significantly worse leprosy disability control group (P = 0.027). DDS group greater strength control group non-dominant shoulder abductor, elbow flexor, hip flexor, knee extensor (P = 0.005, P = 0.029, P = 0.021, P = 0.002, respectively). Weekly walking amount significantly longer (P = 0.020) DDS group control group. total lifetime DDS exposure significantly correlated skeletal muscle mass lower extremity non-dominant leg (r = 0.379, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: DDS-taking leprosy survivors larger skeletal muscle mass greater muscle strength non-taking survivors. dose-response relationship total lifetime DDS exposure skeletal muscle mass lower extremity. findings might suggest potential anti-sarcopenic effects DDS.
