 primacy glucose derived photosynthesis existential source chemical energy across plant animal phyla universally accepted core principle biological sciences. mammalian cells, initial processing glucose triose phosphate intermediates takes place within cytosolic glycolytic pathway terminates temporal transport reducing equivalents derived pyruvate metabolism membrane-associated respiratory complexes mitochondrial matrix. intra-mitochondrial availability molecular oxygen ultimate electron acceptor drives evolutionary fashioned chemiosmotic production ATP high-efficiency biological process. mechanistic bases carcinogenesis demonstrated profound alteration normative mitochondrial function, notably dysregulated respiratory processes. Accordingly, classic Warburg effect functionally links aerobic glycolysis, aberrant production release lactate, metabolic down-regulation mitochondrial oxidative processes carcinogenetic phenotype. surmise, however, aerobic fermentation cancer cells may also represent developmental re-emergence evolutionarily conserved early phenotype, "sidelined" emergence mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation primary mechanism ATP production normal cells. Regardless state-dependent physiological status mixed populations cancer cells, established mitochondria functionally linked initiation cancer progression. Biochemical, molecular, physiological differences cancer cell mitochondria, notably mtDNA heteroplasmy allele-specific expression selected nuclear genes, may represent major focal points novel targeting elimination cancer cells metastatic disease afflicting human populations. date, despite considerable research efforts, practical realization advanced mitochondrial targeted therapies forthcoming.
