 response IMR-90 human fetal lung fibroblasts high population doubling level (PDL > 42) 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25(OH)2D3] investigated clarify whether metabolic molecular parameters senescent cells affected hormone treatment. Pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity significantly increased treatment confluent-phase cells 10 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 24 h. Steroid specificity established failure 10 nM levels 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 affect enzyme activities, estradiol-17 beta progesterone produced slight increase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase levels, respectively. 1,25(OH)2D3 also affected fibroblast proliferation, protein content/cell DNA synthesis. cell number significantly decreased 48 h incubation 1,25(OH)2D3 various concentrations (0.01-1 nM) compared control fibroblasts, increase protein content/cell demonstrated. experiment, carried protracting incubation hormone 72 h, showed similar trend, 10 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 also able inhibit cell proliferation stimulate protein synthesis. incorporation [3H]thymidine DNA increased treatment high PDL fibroblasts 0.01-1 nM hormone 48 h comparison controls.
