 present study investigated antiobesity effects enzymetreated Ecklonia cava extract (EEc) C57BL/6N mice highfat diet (HFD)induced obesity. EEc separated purified digestive enzymes pectinase (Rapidase XPress L) cellulase (Rohament CL) effects progression HFDinduced obesity examined 10 weeks. mice divided 6 groups (n=10/group) follows: Normal diet group, HFD group, mice fed HFD 25 mg/kg/day Garcinia cambogia extract mice fed HFD 5, 25 150 mg/kg/day EEc (EHD groups). Changes body weight, fat, serum lipid levels lipogenic enzyme levels determined. body weight liver weight increased HFD group compared ND group, significantly reduced EEc supplementation. addition, significant reductions epididymal, perirenal mesenteric white adipose tissues present EHD groups three EHD groups exhibited decreases insulin, leptin glutamate pyruvate transaminase levels compared HFD group. addition, EEc treatment significantly decreased serum hepatic triglyceride levels compared HFD group. However, levels highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol ration increased significantly EHD25 150 groups compared HFD group. Changes adipogenic lipogenic protein expression liver assessed western blot analysis. EHD25 -150 groups exhibited reduced levels CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein alpha peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma. However, phosphorylation ratios AMPactivated protein kinase acetylCoA carboxylase significantly increased liver tissue obtained EHD (5, 25 150 mg/kg/day) groups compared HFD group. EEc supplementation reduced levels sterol regulatory elementbinding protein1c, adipose fatty acidbinding protein, fatty acid synthase leptin, significantly increased glucose transporter type 4 adiponectin protein levels liver tissues three EHD groups compared HFD group. Taken together, results suggest EEc exerts antiobesity effects reducing body weight serum hepatic levels obesityassociated factors. Thus, EEc supplementation reduces HFDinduced obesity C57BL/6N mice potential prevent obesity subsequent metabolic disorders.
