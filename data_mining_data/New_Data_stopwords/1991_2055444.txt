 Juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) placed five dietary regimes: fed 1 week, fasted 1 week, fed 3 weeks, fasted 3 weeks, fasted 1 week/refed 2 weeks. Plasma levels glucose, fatty acids, insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide (GLP) activities key metabolic enzymes determined. Plasma glucose levels fed control groups 98.4 +/- 3.4 (SEM) 104.8 +/- 4.7 mg/dl 1 3 weeks, respectively. Plasma glucose fasted 1 week group significantly elevated 128.8 +/- 9.2 mg/dl. Animals fasted 3 weeks fasted 1 week/refed 2 weeks displayed plasma glucose levels similar fed animals. Fasted groups possessed significantly less liver glycogen fed fasted/refed groups. Plasma fatty acids elevated 3 weeks fasting (from 0.39 +/- 0.04 microEq/ml 0.61 +/- 0.06 microEq/ml). response reflected elevated liver lipase activity (from 6.02 +/- 0.44 nmol fatty acid released/hr/mg protein 14.22 +/- 0.90 units). significant alterations liver lipogenesis, assessed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity 3H2O incorporation fatty acids, observed. Gluconeogenic flux, determined indirectly kinetic parameters pyruvate kinase, enhanced animals fasted 3 weeks animals recovering 1-week fast. Plasma insulin levels highest fed groups (7.7 +/- 2.3 5.9 +/- 1.4 ng/ml 1 week 3 weeks, respectively) significantly depressed fasted groups. Plasma levels glucagon GLP also depressed fasted groups. results indicate plasma glucose levels maintained salmon fasting fasting-induced hyperlipidemia mediated lipolytic enzyme activity. Insulin, glucagon, GLP may interact enzyme systems coordinate nutritional metabolism fish.
