 Several studies demonstrated phosphotransfer network, adenylate kinase (AK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activities, allows new perspectives leading understanding disease conditions associated disturbances energy metabolism, metabolic monitoring signalling. sense, aim study evaluate whether experimental infection Aeromonas caviae alters hepatic AK PK activities silver catfish Rhamdia quelen. Hepatic AK PK activities decreased infected animals compared uninfected animals, well hepatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. Also, severe hepatic damage observed infected animals due presence dilation congestion vessels, degeneration hepatocytes loss liver parenchyma architecture sinusoidal structure. Therefore, demonstrated, first time, experimental infection A. caviae inhibits key enzymes linked communication sites ATP generation ATP utilization. Moreover, absence reciprocal compensatory mechanism enzymes contributes directly hepatic damage severe energetic imbalance, may contribute disease pathophysiology.
