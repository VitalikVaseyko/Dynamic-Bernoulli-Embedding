 study describes functional characterization two cell lines derived proximal convoluted (PKSV-PCT cells) proximal straight (PKSV-PR) tubules microdissected kidneys transgenic mice harboring simian virus 40 (SV40) large small antigens placed control rat L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) 5' regulatory sequence. cell lines exhibited cellular cyclic AMP stimulated parathormone (PTH) calcitonin (CT) sodium-dependent glucose transporter. Uptake fluid-phase marker [3H]inulin showed cell lines grown filters exhibited biphasic apical basolateral endocytic rates. Results Northern blot analysis indicate expression antigen gene (Tag) dependent concentration D-glucose medium show L-PK construct maintained capacity up- down-regulation carbohydrates. Replacement D-glucose neoglucogenic substrates (lactate, oxaloacetate) blunted expression Tag transcripts induced arrest cell growth. Compared cell grown D-glucose-enriched medium, hormonal sensitivities PTH CT sodium-dependent glucose uptake unchanged whereas quiescent cells exhibited increased hydrolase content. Thus proximal function preserved cultured cells derived tissue-specific targeted oncogenesis transgenic mice. expression Tag transcripts controlled D-glucose, structural physiological characteristics cell lines studied either quiescent active growth conditions.
