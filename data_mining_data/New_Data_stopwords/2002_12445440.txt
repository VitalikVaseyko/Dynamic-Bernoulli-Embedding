 study vivo modification SAM equivalent circuit highly ordered SAM used bioelectrode, dodecanethiolate SAM-Au intramuscular electrodes studied living rat heart challenging situ perfused rat model impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, neutron activation analysis (NAA). SAM layer experienced disintegration vivo biological system, NAA detected presence Au atoms leached surrounding living tissue. Therefore, underlying Au surface became exposed biological implant. Study impedance spectroscopy, however, revealed perfect capacitive behavior SAM, similar vitro behavior. Electrodes showed pure capacitive Nyquist plot 86.1-89.4 degrees near-vertical line segments equivalent circuit locus, parallel plate capacitor. Impedance magnitude varied linearly 1/omega excluding diffusionally limited ionic charge transport. diffusional conductive element Z(W infinity ) spatially confined Warburg impedance Z(D). effect vivo exposure highly ordered SAM 'sealing over' effect new defects binding proteinaceous lipid species biological milieu, fact significance SAM electrodes used either pacemaker electrodes platform vivo biosensors.
