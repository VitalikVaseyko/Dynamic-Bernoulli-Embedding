 common characteristic tumor cells constant overexpression glycolytic glutaminolytic enzymes. tumor cells hyperactive hexokinase partly inactive pyruvate kinase lead expansion phosphometabolites glucose 6-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate. addition glycolytic phosphometabolites, synthesis metabolic derivatives P-ribose-PP, NADH, NADPH, UTP, CTP, UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine also enhanced cell proliferation. Another phosphometabolite derived P-ribose-PP, AMP, inhibits cell proliferation. accumulation AMP inhibits P-ribose-PP-synthetase increase concentration phosphometabolites derived P-ribose-PP. cells low glycerol 3-phosphate malate-aspartate shuttle capacities inhibition lactate dehydrogenase low NADH levels leads inhibition glycolytic ATP production. Several tumor-therapeutic drugs reduce NAD NADH levels, thereby inhibiting glycolytic energy production. role AMP, NADH, NADPH levels success chemotherapeutic treatment discussed.
