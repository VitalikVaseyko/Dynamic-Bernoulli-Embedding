 BACKGROUND: Proliferating tumour cells express glycolytic isoenzyme, pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK). tumours cells, M2-PK usually exists dimeric form (tumour M2-PK), causing accumulation glycolytic phosphometabolites, allows cells invade areas low oxygen glucose concentrations. AIMS: investigate expression tumour M2-PK metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence Barrett's oesophagus, assess prognostic usefulness tumour M2-PK oesophageal cancer. MATERIALS/METHODS: One hundred ninety cases selected histopathology archives follows: 17 reflux oesophagitis, 37 Barrett's oesophagus, 21 high grade dysplasia, 112 adenocarcinomas, three control tumours. Sections stained immunohistochemically antibody tumour M2-PK. RESULTS: Tumour M2-PK expressed cases, increased cytoplasmic expression seen progression along metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence. cases adenocarcinoma showed 100% staining tumour M2-PK useful prognostic marker. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour M2-PK specific marker Barrett's adenocarcinoma, may important marker transformed highly proliferating clones progression along metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence.
