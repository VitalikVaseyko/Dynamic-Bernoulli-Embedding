 mechanistic understanding mitochondrial dysfunction contributes cell growth tumorigenesis emerging beyond Warburg area research under-explored terms significance clinical management cancer. Work discussed review focuses less Warburg effect mitochondria dysfunctional mitochondria modulate cell cycle, gene expression, metabolism, cell viability, established aspects cell growth stress responses. increasing evidence key oncogenes tumor suppressors modulate mitochondrial dynamics important signaling pathways mitochondrial mass function vary tumors individuals significance events cancer fully appreciated. explore interplay key molecules involved mitochondrial fission fusion apoptosis, well mitophagy, biogenesis, spatial dynamics mitochondria consider distinct mechanisms coordinated response physiological stresses hypoxia nutrient deprivation. Importantly, examine deregulation processes cancer knock effects cell proliferation growth. define major forms mitochondrial dysfunction address extent functional consequences dysfunction determined exploited cancer diagnosis treatment.
