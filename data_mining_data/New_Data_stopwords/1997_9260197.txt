 study assessed whether conditioned media human pancreatic cancer cell line (MIA PaCa 2) interfere intracellular pathways involved glucose metabolism isolated rat hepatocytes. hepatocytes, isolated Male Wistar rats, incubated MIA PaCa 2-conditioned nonconditioned media. Conditioned nonconditioned hepatocytes run 120 min presence absence insulin (100 mM) sampled fixed time intervals. Supernatant glucose levels decreased similar extent time conditioned nonconditioned hepatocytes, lactate levels significantly increased nonconditioned hepatocytes respect conditioned hepatocytes. pyruvate kinase activity increase observed nonconditioned hepatocytes biphasic nature, since increased activity detected 30 min following insulin stimulation. cyclic AMP level increase significantly higher conditioned nonconditioned hepatocytes. appears MIA PaCa 2 cells produce factor(s) may interfere one insulin-mediated intracellular pathways glucose metabolism, namely, glycolysis. detrimental effect glycolysis supported blunted rise lactate concentration medium glucose challenge. substance(s) probably transfers signal inside target cells, activating adenylate cyclase pathway. results support hypothesis pancreatic cancer cause rather consequence diabetes mellitus.
