 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells rapidly switch energy source oxidative phosphorylation glycolytic metabolism order efficiently proliferate. However, molecular mechanisms responsible switch remain unclear. study, found miR-592 frequently downregulated human HCC tissues cell lines, downregulation closely correlated aggressive clinicopathological features poor prognosis HCC patients. Overexpression miR-592 inhibited aerobic glycolysis proliferation HCC cells vitro. Conversely, knockdown miR-592 promoted HCC growth subcutaneous injection orthotopic liver tumor implantation models vivo. Mechanistically, miR-592 downregulation human HCCs correlated upregulation WD repeat SOCS box containing 1 (WSB1). showed miR-592 directly binds 3'-UTR WSB1 gene, thus disrupting hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein stabilization. turn, overexpression WSB1 HCC cells rescued decreased HIF-1alpha expression, glucose uptake, HCC growth induced miR-592. Collectively, clinical data functional studies suggest miR-592 new robust inhibitor Warburg effect promising therapeutic target HCC treatment.
