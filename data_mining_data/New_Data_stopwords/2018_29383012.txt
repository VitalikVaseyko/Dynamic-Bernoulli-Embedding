 evaluate microbeam radiation therapy (MRT), brain tumor treatment, bystander effect nonirradiated companion animals investigated. Adult rats irradiated 35 350 Gy European Synchrotron Research Facility using homogenous irradiation (HR) MRT right brain hemisphere. irradiated rats housed nonirradiated rats. 48 hours, rats euthanized frontal lobe proteome analyzed using 2-dimensional electrophoresis mass spectrometry. Proteome changes determined analysis variance (P < .05). Homogenous irradiation increased serum albumin, heat shock protein 71 (HSP-71), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), prohibitin decreased dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD) pyruvate kinase. Microbeam radiation therapy increased HSP-71, FBA, prohibitin, decreased aconitase, dihydropyrimidinase, TPI, tubulin DLD, pyruvate kinase. Cage mates HR irradiated rats showed increased HSP-71 FBA decreased pyruvate kinase, DLD, aconitase. Cage mates MRT irradiated rats showed increased HSP-71, prohibitin, FBA decreased aconitase DLD. Homogenous irradiation proteome changes indicated tumorigenesis, MRT proteome changes indicated oxidative stress response. bystander effect proteome changes appeared antitumorigenic inducing radioresistance. investigation also supports need research prohibitin interaction HSP-70/71 chaperones cancer therapy.
