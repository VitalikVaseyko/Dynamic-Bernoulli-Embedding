 detailed characterization central metabolic network Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-7D carried cometabolism different mixtures glucose acetate, using aerobic C-limited chemostats one two substrates labeled (13)C. confirm role malic enzyme, isogenic strain corresponding gene deleted grown conditions. labeling patterns proteinogenic amino acids analyzed used estimate metabolic fluxes and/or make inferences vivo activities enzymes central carbon metabolism amino acid biosynthesis. Malic enzyme flux increased linearly increasing acetate fraction. growth very-high-acetate fraction, activity malic enzyme satisfied biosynthetic needs pyruvate mitochondria, cytosol pyruvate supplied via pyruvate kinase. several cases enzyme activities unexpectedly detected, e.g., glyoxylate shunt very-low-acetate fraction, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase acetate fraction 0.46 C-mol acetate/C-mol substrate, glucose catabolism CO(2) via tricarboxylic acid cycle very-high-acetate fraction. Cytoplasmic alanine aminotransferase activity detected, evidence found alpha-isopropylmalate synthase two active forms vivo, one mitochondrial short cytoplasmic form.
