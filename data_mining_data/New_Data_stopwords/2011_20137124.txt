 study aimed construct shRNA eukaryotic expression vectors M2-pyruvate kinase gene (pkm2) investigate effects pkm2 gene interference drug resistance acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells vitro. Three specific shRNAs pkm2 gene designed cloned PBSU6 vector containing U6 promotor. constructed plasmids identified proved restriction sequence analysis. effect pkm2-shRNA protein expression endogenous PKM2 detected NB4R2 cells, drug resistant cell line APL Western blot. alteration NB4R2 cell differentiation interference pkm2 gene also validated nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test. results showed three specific shRNA eukaryotic expression vectors targeting pkm2 successfully constructed. efficiency pkm2 gene silence proved protein level. interference pkm2 gene could significantly enhance cell differentiation drug resistant NB4R2 cell line. concluded DNA vector containing pkm2 targeting shRNA remarkably promotes differentiation NB4R2 cells, showing prospects developing gene target drug.
