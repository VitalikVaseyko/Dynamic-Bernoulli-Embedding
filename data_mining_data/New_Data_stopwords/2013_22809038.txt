 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) regulate expression genes involved lipid metabolism, energy production, inflammation. role ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) less clear, although research indicates involvement PPARs forms preconditioning. study aimed explore effects PPAR-alpha activation I/R injury potential cardioprotective downstream mechanisms involved. Langendorff-perfused hearts rats pretreated selective PPAR-alpha agonist WY-14643 (WY, pirinixic acid; 3 mg.(kg body mass).day(-1); 5 days) subjected 30 min ischaemia - 2 h reperfusion without phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt inhibitor wortmannin evaluation functional (left ventricular developed pressure, LVDP) recovery, infarct size (IS), reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. 2-fold increase baseline PPAR-alpha mRNA levels (qPCR) WY-treated group higher post-I/R PPAR-alpha levels compared untreated controls accompanied similar changes expression PPAR-alpha target genes PDK4 mCPT-1, regulating glucose fatty acid metabolism, enhanced Akt phosphorylation. Post-ischaemic LVDP restoration WY-treated hearts reached 60% +/- 9% pre-ischaemic values compared 24% +/- 3% control hearts (P < 0.05), coupled reduced incidence ventricular fibrillation blunted wortmannin. Results indicate PPAR-alpha up-regulation may confer preconditioning-like protection via metabolic effects. Downstream mechanisms PPAR-alpha-mediated cardioprotection may involve PI3K-Akt activation.
