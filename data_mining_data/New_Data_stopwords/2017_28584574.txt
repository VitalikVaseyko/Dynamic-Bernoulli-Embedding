 BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Recent living condition improvements, changes dietary habits, reductions physical activity contributing increase metabolic syndrome symptoms including diabetes obesity. societal developments, humankind continuously exposed metabolic diseases diabetes, number victims increasing. study investigated Cordyceps militaris water extract (CMW)-induced glucose uptake HepG2 cells effect CMW treatment glucose metabolism. MATERIALS/METHODS: Colorimetric assay kits used determine glucokinase (GK) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activities, glucose uptake, glycogen content. Either RT-PCR western blot analysis performed quantitation glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1alpha), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k), protein kinase B (Akt), phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, GK, PDH, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3beta) expression levels. alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities acarbose CMW evaluated absorbance measurement. RESULTS: CMW induced glucose uptake HepG2 cells increasing GLUT2 HNF-1alpha expression stimulation. Glucose cells increased CMW-induced phosphorylation AMPK. turn, glycolysis stimulated, glyconeogenesis inhibited. Furthermore, studying mechanism action PI3k, Akt, GSK-3beta, measuring glycogen content, study confirmed glucose stored liver glycogen. Finally, CMW resulted higher level alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity acarbose. CONCLUSION: CMW induced uptake glucose HepG2 cells, well, induced metabolism absorbed glucose. concluded CMW candidate potential use diabetes prevention treatment.
