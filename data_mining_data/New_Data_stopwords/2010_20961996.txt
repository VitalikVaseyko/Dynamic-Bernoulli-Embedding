 human neuroblastoma, amplification MYCN gene predicts poor prognosis resistance therapy. hypoxia contributes aggressive tumor phenotypes, predominantly via two structurally related hypoxia inducible factors, HIF-1alpha HIF-2alpha, examined hypoxia responses MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. demonstrate HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, preferentially expressed MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells primary tumors comparison samples without MYCN amplification. results showed interplay N-Myc HIF-1alpha plays critical roles neuroblastoma. example, high levels N-Myc override HIF-1alpha inhibition cell cycle progression, enabling continued proliferation hypoxia. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha N-Myc essential Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) neuroblastomas activating transcription multiple glycolytic genes. note, expressions Phosphoglycerate Kinase 1 (PGK1), Hexokinase 2 (HK2), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDHA) significantly higher MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas tumors without MYCN amplification. Interestingly, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells "addicted" LDHA enzymatic activity, depletion completely inhibits tumorigenesis vivo. Thus, results provide mechanistic insights explaining MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells contend hypoxic stress paradoxically hypoxia contributes neuroblastoma aggressiveness combinatorial effects N-Myc HIF-1alpha. results also suggest LDHA represents novel, pharmacologically tractable target neuroblastoma therapeutics.
