 process using ligand-coupled particles aqueous polyethylene glycol-dextran two-phase polymer systems developed achieve highly selective, scaleable biochemical separation process. Product protein bound ligand-coupled particles quantitatively distribute polyethylene glycol-rich upper phase. proteins contaminants partition preferentially dextran-rich lower phase.The process offers significant advantages affinity partitioning ligand coupled backbone polyethylene glycol polymer. advantages include much wider diversity ligands coupled particles effective confinement ligand process. Affinity partition ligands coupled particles amenable scale-up affinity chromatography. variety commercially available Sepharose-based particles suitable process. Homogenates Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genetically altered overproduce pyruvate kinase, Cibacron blue F3G-A-coupled Sepharose particles used model system process. Binding studies with/without aqueous two-phase systems show formation two-phase system adsorption equilibrium reached affect apparent dissociation constant. Binding protein ligand-coupled particles rapid single-phase systems polymer two-phase system. Single-phase binding eliminates mass transfer resistance associated redistribution product protein dextran-rich bottom phase polyethylene glycol-rich top phase.
