 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rapidly becoming one prevalent cancers worldwide prominent source mortality. Ras-related associated diabetes (RRAD), one first members 35-39 kDa class novel Ras-related GTPases, linked several types cancer, although function HCC remains unclear. study, observed RRAD downregulated HCC compared adjacent normal tissues. change associated poor prognosis. Furthermore, knockdown RRAD SK-Hep-1 cells facilitated cell proliferation, accelerated G1/S transition cell cycle, induced cell migration, reduced apoptosis. contrast, overexpression RRAD Huh7 cells opposite effects. Moreover, demonstrated RRAD induced cell proliferation regulation cell cycle downregulating cyclins cyclin-dependent kinases. RRAD induced tumor cell apoptosis mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. addition, confirmed knockdown RRAD promoted aerobic glycolysis upregulating glucose transporter 1, whereas overexpression RRAD inhibited aerobic glycolysis. conclusion, RRAD plays pivotal role potential tumor suppressor HCC. improved understanding roles RRAD tumor metabolism may provide insights potential novel molecular target HCC therapy.
