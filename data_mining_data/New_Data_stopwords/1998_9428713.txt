 many years known K+ essential activator pyruvate kinase [Kachmar, J. F. & Boyer, P. D. (1953) J. Biol. Chem. 200, 669-683] Na+ induces relatively small enhancements activity. effect two alkali metal ions activity pyruvate kinase entrapped low water environment reverse 'micelles formed cetyltrimethylammonium, hexanol, n-octane various water concentrations studied. reverse micelles 3.6% water, activity 7 mM Na+ 82 times higher aqueous solution equivalent Na+ concentration. concentration water reverse micelles raised, activating effect relatively low concentrations Na+ (or K+) decreases simultaneously 100-fold increase concentration Na+ K+ required attaining half-maximal activation. Similar results obtained NH4+, Rb+ Cs+. Therefore, amount water system critical observing activation alkali metal ions. fact, concentration Na+ required half-maximal activation standard aqueous media higher concentrations experimentally assayed. evidenced fluorescence kinetic data, appears entrapment pyruvate kinase reverse micelles produce gross structural alterations. Therefore, suggested conventional aqueous systems, basis high discrimination Na+ K+ pyruvate kinase higher energy required desolvating Na+. Nevertheless, water concentrations studied, activities reached K+ higher Na+ suggests Na+ form enzyme lower catalytic capacity K+-enzyme complex.
