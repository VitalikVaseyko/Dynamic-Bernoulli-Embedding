 Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, induces extensive loss tubular epithelial cells, associated delayed graft function following kidney transplantation. Recent reports suggested cell death I/R injury occurs autophagy, cellular degradation process responsible turnover unnecessary dysfunctional organelles cytoplasmic proteins, well apoptosis. Recently, demonstrated overexpression anti-apoptotic factor, Bcl-2, inhibited tubular apoptosis subsequent tubulointerstitial damage I/R injury. Autophagy also observed cells undergoing cell death several diseases. Therefore, hypothesized increased Bcl-2 protein may protect tubular epithelial cells suppressing autophagy inhibiting apoptosis. present study, transgenic mouse model (LC3-GFP TG) autophagosomes labeled LC3-GFP Bcl-2/LC3-GFP double transgenic mice (Bcl-2/LC3-GFP TG) used examine effect Bcl-2 I/R-induced autophagy. I/R injury, associated marked disruption normal tubular morphology, promoted formation LC3-GFP dots, representing extensively induced autophagosomes. electron microscopy, autophagosomes contained mitochondria I/R-injured tubular epithelial cells. contrast, Bcl-2 augmentation suppressed formation autophagosomes less tubular damage. conclusion, Bcl-2 augmentation protected renal tubular epithelial cells I/R injury suppressing autophagosomal degradation inhibiting tubular apoptosis.
