 method developed calculating rate constants dehydration aldehydes induce ATPase reactions kinases 18O transferred aldehyde hydrate inorganic phosphate reaction. method involves measurement fraction 18O phosphate 31P NMR ATPase reaction proceeded several minutes zero-order kinetics. reaction started addition aldehyde small volume H2 18O, speed washout 18O reversible dehydration relative rate ATPase reaction allows calculation rate constants hydration equilibrium constant known proton NMR spectrum aldehyde. Dehydration rate constants (s-1 pH 8-8.5, 0.1 buffer, 25 degrees C) following aldehydes (all 95% hydrated) kinases used follows: D-glyceraldehyde glycerokinase, 0.03; 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose 6-phosphate fructose-6-phosphate kinase, 0.025; 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose 2,5-anhydro-D-talose fructokinase, 0.029 0.017, respectively; D-gluco-hexodialdose hexokinase, 0.068. betaine aldehyde choline kinase glyoxylate pyruvate kinase, 18O transferred phosphate ATPase reactions. However, dehydration rate constant glyoxylate (0.007 s-1 pH 7 extrapolated zero buffer concentration 0.11 s-1 pH 9.0 0.3 buffer) determined extrapolating initial rate reduction free aldehyde catalyzed lactate dehydrogenase infinite enzyme levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
