 Endogenous kinase activity highly purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex bovine kidney markedly inhibited N-ethylmaleimide certain disulfides. Inhibition disulfides highly specific reversed thiols. 5,5'-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) potent inhibitor, showing significant inhibition concentration low 1 microM. Cystamine, oxidized glutathione, pantethine, lipoic acid, lipoamide, ergothionine, insulin, oxytocin, vasopressin ineffective. Hydrogen peroxide t-butyl hydroperoxide inactive. data indicate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (EC 2.7.1.99) contains thiol group (or groups) involved maintaining conformation enzyme facilitates phosphorylation inactivation protein substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1). findings suggest modulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity thiol-disulfide exchange may important physiological mechanism regulation kinase activity and, hence, activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
