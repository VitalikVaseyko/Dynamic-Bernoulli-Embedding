 Previous studies shown concentration red blood cell (RBC) magnesium significantly lower subjects carrying HLA-BW 35 antigen (p less 0.001) non-carriers. finding might related modifications RBC membrane sialoglycoconjugates, RBC sialic acid comparatively determined BW 35+ BW 35- subjects. Pyruvate-kinase activity mean RBC volume, reticulocyte count also determined order estimate whether significant variations level age markers could detected HLA BW 35+ BW 35- subjects. significant negative correlation sialic acid RBC magnesium concentrations observed whole population tested (n 57, p less 0.005), 61% BW 35+ 25% BW 35- individuals sialic acid values above, magnesium values overall mean (p less 0.01). variance mean RBC volume also larger BW 35+ group. determinations show significant variations, suggesting results related RBC age.
