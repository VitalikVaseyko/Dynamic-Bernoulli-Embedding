 Pyruvate kinase (PKLR) critical erythrocyte enzyme required glycolysis production ATP. shown Pklr deficiency mice reduces severity (reduced parasitemia, increased survival) blood stage malaria induced infection Plasmodium chabaudi AS. Likewise, studies human erythrocytes infected ex vivo P. falciparum show presence host PK-deficiency alleles reduces infection phenotypes. characterized genetic diversity PKLR gene, including haplotype structure presence rare coding variants two populations malaria endemic areas Thailand Senegal. investigated effect PKLR genotypes rich longitudinal datasets including haematological malaria-associated phenotypes. coding possibly damaging variant (R41Q) identified Thai population minor allele frequency ~4.7%. Arginine 41 (R41) highly conserved pyruvate kinase family substitution Glutamine (R41Q) affects protein stability. Heterozygosity R41Q shown associated significant reduction number attacks Plasmodium falciparum, correlating increased number Plasmodium vivax infections. results strongly suggest PKLR protein variants may affect frequency, intensity malaria episodes induced different Plasmodium parasites humans living areas endemic malaria.
