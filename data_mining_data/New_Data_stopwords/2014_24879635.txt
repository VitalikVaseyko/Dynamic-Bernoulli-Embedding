 Gemcitabine resistance remains significant clinical challenge. Here, used novel glucose transporter (Glut) inhibitor, CG-5, proof-of-concept compound investigate therapeutic utility targeting Warburg effect overcome gemcitabine resistance pancreatic cancer. effects gemcitabine and/or CG-5 viability, survival, glucose uptake DNA damage evaluated gemcitabine-sensitive gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies conducted determine molecular basis gemcitabine resistance mechanism CG-5-induced sensitization gemcitabine. effects CG-5 gemcitabine sensitivity investigated xenograft tumor model gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer. contrast gemcitabine-sensitive pancreatic cancer cells, resistant Panc-1 Panc-1(GemR) cells responded gemcitabine increasing expression ribonucleotide reductase M2 catalytic subunit (RRM2) E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation. Acting pan-Glut inhibitor, CG-5 abrogated gemcitabine-induced upregulation RRM2 decreased E2F1 expression, thereby enhancing gemcitabine-induced DNA damage inhibition cell survival. CG-5-induced inhibition E2F1 expression mediated induction previously unreported E2F1-targeted microRNA, miR-520f. addition oral CG-5 gemcitabine therapy caused greater suppression Panc-1(GemR) xenograft tumor growth vivo either drug alone. Glut inhibition may effective strategy enhance gemcitabine activity treatment pancreatic cancer.
