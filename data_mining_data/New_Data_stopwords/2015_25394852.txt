 abnormal metabolism cancer cells crucial feature tumors provides promising therapeutic targets cancer treatments. Aerobic glycolysis cancer cells, termed Warburg effect, highlighted characteristic cancerspecific metabolism. However, effect glycolysis inhibition hepatocarcinogenesis remains elucidated. present study, effects glycolysis inhibitor 2deoxyDglucose (2DG) Ndiethylnitrosamine (DEN)induced rat hepatocarcinoma model underlying mechanisms investigated. observed 2DG significantly delayed hepatocarcinogenesis effectively prolonged survival time DENtreated rats. glycolysis inhibitor, 2DG prominently decreased cell proliferation increased cell apoptosis DENinduced rat hepatoma evident impact pericarcinomatous liver tissues. investigation revealed 2DG resulted reduction glycolysis products, compensatory increase hexokinase 2 expression decrease 6phosphofructo2kinase, pyruvate kinase M2 lactate dehydrogenase expression hepatoma tissues. inhibition glycolysis suppressed tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid cholesterol biosynthesis ATP production, promoted autophagic activation. addition, vitro study demonstrated hypoxia, important factor tumor microenvironment, may assist increasing 2DGinduced inhibition cell viability, cell cycle retardation decrease colony formation ability hepatoma cells. Taken together, present results suggested 2DG may inhibit hepatocarcinogenesis DENtreated rats via restricting cancer cell metabolism. finding provides promising measure prevention treatment hepatoma.
