 extensive metabolism amino acids (AA) fuel important reason low use efficiency protein pigs. study, investigated whether regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)/pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha 1 (PDHA1) pathway affected AA consumption porcine intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells intestinal bacteria pigs. effects knockdown PDHA1 PDK1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) nutrient consumption IPEC-J2 cells evaluated. IPEC-J2 cells cultured sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) quantify AA glucose consumption nutrient oxidative metabolism. results showed knockdown PDHA1 using siRNA decreased glucose consumption increased total AA (TAA) glutamate (Glu) consumption IPEC-J2 cells (P < 0.05). Opposite effects observed using siRNA targeting PDK1 (P < 0.05). Additionally, culturing IPEC-J2 cells presence 5 mM DCA markedly increased phosphorylation PDHA1 PDH phosphatase 1, inhibited PDK1 phosphorylation (P < 0.05). DCA treatment also reduced TAA Glu consumption increased glucose depletion (P < 0.05). results indicated PDH regulatory target shifting AA metabolism glucose metabolism culturing cells DCA decreased consumption AAs increasing depletion glucose PDH activation.
