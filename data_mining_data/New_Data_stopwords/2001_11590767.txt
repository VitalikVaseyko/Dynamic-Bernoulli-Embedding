 Concentration copper zinc isolated Suillus bovinus mycelia, used nutrient solution 0.5 mol/L EDTA mycelia washing solution measured investigate distribution heavy metals mycelia growth excess copper zinc nutrient solution. Treated zinc, added zinc maintained used solution, 9.8%/14.6% in/on mycelia treatment, treatment 2 3.9%/8.0% in/on mycelia. copper applications, copper stimulated mycelia, i.e., 25.9%/4.5% in/on mycelia treatment, 7%/18.8% in/on mycelia copper retained used nutrient solution. Certain amount copper zinc uptake mycelia led pronounced influence glycolysis nitrogen incorporating process Suillus bovinus, tested enzymes kept constant treatment. crude extracts copper treatment 2 mycelia, activities HK, PFK GS inhibited decrease 63%, 48% 38% GIDH increased 68% control, respectively. behaviors tested enzymes toward zinc corresponded general towards copper. potential protection Suillus bovinus host plant excess copper zinc threaten discussed.
