 Uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) skeletal muscle key regulators glucose lipid metabolic processes involved insulin resistance. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) anti-obesogenic effects rodents humans, long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) cause increases body weight insulin resistance. clarify beneficial effects MCFAs, examined UCP3 PDK4 expression skeletal muscles mice fed MCFA- LCFA-enriched high-fat diet (HFD). Five-week feeding LCFA-enriched HFD caused high body weight gain induced glucose intolerance mice, compared mice fed MCFA-enriched HFD. However, amounts UCP3 PDK4 transcripts skeletal muscle mice fed MCFA- LCFA-enriched HFD similar. elucidate specific effects MCFAs, capric acid (C10:0), lipid metabolism skeletal muscles, examined effects various FAs expression UCP3 PDK4, mouse C2C12 myocytes. Although palmitic acid (C16:0) lauric acid (C12:0) significantly induced expression UCP3 PDK4, capric acid (C10:0) upregulated UCP3 expression via activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta. Furthermore, palmitic acid (C16:0) disturbed insulin-induced phosphorylation Akt, MCFAs, including lauric (C12:0), capric (C10:0), caprylic acid (C12:0), not. results suggest capric acid (C10:0) increases capacity fatty acid oxidation without inhibiting glycolysis skeletal muscle.
