 Epidemiologic studies shown treatment diabetics metformin reduced risk cancer-related mortality. Here, investigated chemopreventive effects metformin dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colorectal carcinogenesis diabetic SD rats following metformin treatment effect Warburg effect involved process. Diabetic rat models induced high-fat feeding combination low dose Streptozotocin (STZ) induce colorectal cancer low dose DMH. formation colorectal Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) incidence, number size tumor measured. proliferation indices colonic tissues determined Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining. detect expression PK IDH colonic tissues using immunohistochemistry Western blot. enzyme activities HK PDH colonic tissues measured. growth expression PK IDH activity HK PDH cell lines LoVo HT-29 measured metformin treatment. results showed metformin treatment significantly inhibited formation ACF tumors. proliferation index colonic tissues significantly decreased following metformin treatment. addition, metformin inhibited cell growth decreased imbalance expression enzymes involved glycolysis TCA cycle. findings suggested metformin might produce synergistic colon cancer-preventative effect diabetic patients regulation enzymes expression involved glucose metabolism.
