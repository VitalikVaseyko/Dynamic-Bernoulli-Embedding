 Bile acids (BAs) digestive surfactants also important cell signaling molecules, stimulate several signaling pathways regulate important biological processes. bile-acid-activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays pivotal role regulating bile acid, lipid glucose homeostasis well regulating inflammatory responses, barrier function prevention bacterial translocation intestinal tract. expected, FXR involved pathophysiology wide range diseases gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer type 2 diabetes. review, discuss current knowledge roles FXR physiology digestive system related diseases. Better understanding roles FXR digestive system accelerate development FXR ligands/modulators treatment digestive system diseases.
