 Feeding profoundly affects metabolic responses exercise various tissues, effect feeding status human adipose tissue responses exercise never studied. Ten healthy overweight men aged 26 +/- 5 yr (mean +/- SD) waist circumference 105 +/- 10 cm walked 60% maximum oxygen uptake either fasted fed conditions randomized, counterbalanced design. Feeding comprised 648 +/- 115 kcal 2 h exercise. Blood samples collected regular intervals examine changes metabolic parameters adipokine concentrations. Adipose tissue samples obtained baseline 1 h exercise examine changes adipose tissue mRNA expression secretion selected adipokines ex vivo. Adipose tissue mRNA expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4), adipose triglyceride lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), fatty acid translocase/CD36, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) response exercise lower fed compared fasted conditions (all P </= 0.05). Postexercise adipose IRS2 protein affected feeding (P </= 0.05), Akt2, AMPK, IRS1, GLUT4, PDK4, HSL protein levels different. Feeding status impact serum ex vivo adipose secretion IL-6, leptin, adiponectin response exercise. first study show feeding acute exercise affects postexercise adipose tissue gene expression, propose feeding likely blunt long-term adipose tissue adaptation regular exercise.
