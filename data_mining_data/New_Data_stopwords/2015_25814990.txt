 UNLABELLED: Multiple sclerosis (MS) inflammatory demyelinating disease central nervous system (CNS). Accumulation brain damage progressive MS partly result mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) attacking myelin sheaths CNS. Although cure yet MS, significant advances made development disease modifying agents. Unfortunately, drugs fail reverse established neurological deficits adverse effects. Recent evidence suggests MPs polarization accompanied profound metabolic changes, whereby pro-inflammatory MPs (M1) switch toward glycolysis, whereas anti-inflammatory MPs (M2) become oxidative. therefore possible reprograming MPs metabolism could affect function repress immune cell activation. mini review describes metabolic changes underpinning macrophages polarization anticipates metabolic re-education MPs could used treatment MS. KEY POINTS: Inflammation progressive MS mediated primarily MPs.Cell metabolism regulates function MPs.DMAs re-educate metabolism MPs promote healing.
