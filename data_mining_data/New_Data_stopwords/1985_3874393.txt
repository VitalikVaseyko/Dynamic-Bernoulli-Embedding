 absence creatine phosphate, MgATP produced relaxation rigor tension chemically-skinned right papillary muscles rat, half maximal effect obtained 1.8 mM MgATP. presence 12 mM creatine phosphate 250 microM ADP, decrease MgATP concentration even 10(-9) never induced rigor tension. low MgATP concentration (10(-6) M), half maximal relaxing effect obtained 2 mM creatine phosphate, value close Km isolated MM-creatine kinase substrate, 14 microM MgADP, value 5 times lower reported Km. exogenous MgATP regenerating system (phosphoenol pyruvate + pyruvate kinase) able fully relax fibres. MM-creatine kinase inhibited fluorodinitrobenzene, dependency rigor tension MgATP became without creatine phosphate. washing fluorodinitrobenzene addition exogenous MM-creatine kinase half hour fully relaxed rigor tension; moreover, effect persisted even prolonged washout. results show endogenous MM-creatine kinase able ensure maximal efficiency myosin ATPase producing localized high MgATP/MgADP ratio; also suggest existence rapidly exchangeable binding sites MM-creatine kinase cardiac myofibrils.
