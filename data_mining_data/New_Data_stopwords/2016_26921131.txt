 Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway drives cancer progression direct regulation oncogenic properties. Here, report PI3K pathway signaling up-regulates cancer cell proliferation, metastasis angiogenesis modulation cancer metabolism. oncogenic metabolic processes disrupted, novel PI3K inhibitor, 3-Dihydro-2-(naphthalene-1-yl) quinazolin-4(1H)-one (DHNQ) colon cancer cells. DHNQ inhibited Warburg effect lipid synthesis reducing gene expression glycolytic lipogenesis regulatory enzymes. downregulation gene level DHNQ inhibited metabolic flux repress proliferation, migration invasion characteristics colon cancer. Furthermore, metabolic attenuation caused repression vitro/in vivo angiogenesis providing new insights PI3K regulated angiogenesis via metabolic alterations. results suggest multifaceted targeting oncogenic metabolism upstream PI3K regulatory signaling may effective cancer treatment approach.
