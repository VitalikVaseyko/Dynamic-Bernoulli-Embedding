 Cancer cells prefer glycolysis energy metabolism, even sufficient oxygen make unnecessary. called Warburg effect, promotes tumorigenesis malignant progression. study, demonstrated EZH2, multifaceted oncogenic protein involved tumor proliferation, invasion metastasis, promotes glioblastoma tumorigenesis malignant progression activation Warburg effect. observed HIF1alpha target EZH2 whose activation necessary EZH2-mediated metabolic adaption, HIF1alpha activated upon EZH2 overexpression. EZH2 suppressed expression EAF2, turn upregulated HIF1alpha levels. conclude results EZH2 promotes tumorigenesis malignant progression part activating glycolysis EAF2-HIF1alpha signaling axis.
