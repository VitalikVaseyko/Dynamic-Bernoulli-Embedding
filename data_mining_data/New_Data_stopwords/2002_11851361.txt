 heart, like organs, possesses internal circadian clock. clocks provide selective advantage anticipation, enabling organ prepare given stimulus, thereby optimizing appropriate response. heart diabetes associated alterations morphology, gene expression, metabolism contractile performance. present study investigated whether diabetes also alters circadian clock heart. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus induced rats treatment streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg/kg). STZ increased humoral (glucose non-esterified fatty acids) heart gene expression (myosin heavy chain beta, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 uncoupling protein 3) markers diabetes. circadian patterns gene expression seven components mammalian clock (bmal1, clock, cry1, cry2, per1, per2 per3), well three clock output genes (dbp, hlf tef), compared hearts isolated control STZ-induced diabetic rats. components clock investigated possessed circadian rhythms gene expression. hearts isolated STZ-induced diabetic rats, phases circadian rhythms altered (approximately 3 h early) compared observed control hearts. clock heart therefore lost normal synchronization environment diabetes. Whether loss synchronization plays role development contractile dysfunction heart diabetes remains determined.
