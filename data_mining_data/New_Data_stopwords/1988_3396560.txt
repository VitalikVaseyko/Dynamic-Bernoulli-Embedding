 erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration (2,3-DPG) activity red cell hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione reductase studied 27 normal volunteers 2 4 months physical endurance training. 4 months training increased maximal oxygen uptake physical working capacity (PWC130) 16% (p less 0.001) 29% (p less 0.001) respectively. Resting heart rate decreased (p less 0.001) 11 beats.min-1. 2 months training erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentration increased 9% (p less 0.001); 4 months training increase 4% (p less 0.05). training-induced increase red cell 2,3-DPG accompanied enhanced activity erythrocyte hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione reductase. concluded rise red cell 2,3-DPG induced physical endurance training due activation red cell glycolytic enzymes enzymes involved pentose-phosphate cycle.
