 H2O2, addition producing highly reactive molecules hydroxyl radicals peroxidase action, exert number direct effects cells, organelles enzymes. stimulations include glucose transport, glucose incorporation glycogen, HMP shunt pathway, lipid synthesis, release calcium mitochondria arachidonate phospholipids, poly ADP ribosylation, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase activities. inactivations include glycolysis, lipolysis, reacylation lysophospholipids, ATP synthesis, superoxide dismutase protein kinase C. Damages DNA proteoglycan general cytotoxicity possibly oxygen radicals also observed. whole new range effects opened finding H2O2 act signal transducer oxidative stress oxidizing dithiol protein disulphide form activates transcription stress inducible genes. Many direct effects seem obtained dithiol-disulphide modification proteins active sites, part adaptive responses oxidative stress.
