 Interpretation factor analysis 18 metabolic parameters bovine lens leads determination following criteria lens metabolism: Factor 1: Biologic aging lens 33.9%; Factor 2: Glycolysis regulation 17.7%; Factor 3: Topography lens metabolism 8.7%; Factor 4: Regulation fructose breakdown 7.9%; Factor 5: Substrate depot 6.6%; Factor 6: Kinases 6.3%. results could partly experimentally verified. interpretation factor analysis attempt fit biochemical processes formal statistical parameters. indication variables investigation indendently responsible age dependend changes. However, set-up made evident rather complex biochemical influences different intensity bring observed aging phenomena. may assumed variables acts "triggering mechanism". Age related disturbances biochemical balance may initiated glycolysis regulation factor, importance expressed high portion 17%. changes ratio reduced oxydized coenzymes may act "triggering mechanism" (26, 30). Topography lens metabolism, carbohydrate breakdown via metabolic pathways, presence substrate depots, internal regulation kinases are, according portion factor loading, equal importance respect aging processes, however, factors 1 2, 50% portion, must given precedence consideration. Factor 1, interpreted "biological lens aging", yields 1/3 information age influence lens metabolism. factor stands independent loaded lens weight, accepted age representative. However, lens weight means protein well process protein synthesis. may assumed factor represents connective link protein carbohydrate metabolism, since well known changes protein belong remarkable age disturbances (31,32), quality proteins dependent period synthesis (18,33).
