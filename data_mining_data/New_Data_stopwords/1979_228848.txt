 Cell proximity profound effect glycolytic enzyme levels observed mammalian cells grown vitro. Hexokinase activity generally increased increasing cell density untransformed virus-transformed cultures. contrast, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activities generally elevated crowded cultures transformed cells. spontaneous experimental mouse tumor cell line (EMT6) exhibited cell crowding-dependent elevations glycolytic enzyme levels cultured vitro. glycolytic enzyme levels experimental mouse tumors grown vivo, hand, constant normally less observed cultured EMT6 cells.
