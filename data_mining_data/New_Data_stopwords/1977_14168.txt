 protease Tetrahymena pyriformis inactivated eight nine commercially available enzymes tested, including lactate deyhdrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (TPN-specific), glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, D-amino acid oxidase, fumarase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, citrate synthase. Urate oxidase inactivated. Inactivation occurred neutral pH, prevented inhibitors protease, followed first order kinetics. cases tested, inactivation enhanced mercaptoethanol. enzyme-inactivating activity due protease molecular weight 25,000 eluted DEAE-Sephadex 0.3 KCl. second protease molecular weight, retained gel, inactivated isocitrate dehydrogenase D-amino acid oxidase. two proteases could also distinguished temperature inhibitor sensitivity. Two protease peaks obtained DEAE-Sephadex chromatography little enzyme inactivating activity, another attacked D-amino acid oxidase. least six enzymes could protected proteolytic inactivation various ligands. Isocitrates dehydrogenase protected isocitrate, TPN, TPNH, glucose-6-dehydrogenase glucose-6-P TPN, pyruvate kinase phosphoenolypyruvate ADP, hexokinase glucose, fumarase mixture fumarate malate. Lactate dehdrogenase protected either substrates coenzymes. Citrate synthase probably protected oxalacetate. data suggest protease proteases discussed may participate inactivation degradation least enzymes Tetrahymena. Since inactivation occurs neutral pH, process could regulated variations cellular levels substrates, coenzymes, allosteric regulators resulting form changes growth conditions growth state. mechanism would permit selective retention enzymes metabolically active pathways.
