 heart adapts changes nutritional status energy demands adjusting relative metabolism carbohydrates fatty acids. Loss metabolic flexibility occurs diabetes mellitus associated cardiovascular disease heart failure. study long-term consequences impaired metabolic flexibility, generated mice overexpress pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4 selectively heart. Hearts PDK4 transgenic mice marked decrease glucose oxidation corresponding increase fatty acid catabolism. Although overt cardiomyopathy observed PDK4 transgenic mice, introduction PDK4 transgene mice expressing constitutively active form phosphatase calcineurin, causes cardiac hypertrophy, caused cardiomyocyte fibrosis striking increase mortality. results demonstrate cardiac-specific overexpression PDK4 sufficient cause loss metabolic flexibility exacerbates cardiomyopathy caused calcineurin stress-activated pathway.
