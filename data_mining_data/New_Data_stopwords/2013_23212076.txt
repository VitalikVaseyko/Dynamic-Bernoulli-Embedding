 Cancer cells distinct metabolism highly depends glycolysis instead mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation alone, known aerobic glycolysis. Pyruvate kinase (PK), catalyzes final step glycolysis, emerged potential regulator metabolic phenotype. Expression PK type M2 (PKM2) increased facilitates lactate production cancer cells, determines whether glucose carbons degraded pyruvate lactate channeled synthetic processes. Modulation PKM2 catalytic activity also regulates synthesis DNA lipids required cell proliferation. However, mechanisms PKM2 coordinates high-energy requirements high anabolic activities support cancer cell proliferation still completely understood. review summarizes biological characteristics PKM2 discusses dual role cancer metabolism well potential therapeutic applications. Given pleiotropic effects cancer biology, PKM2 represents attractive target cancer therapy.
