 EGb 761 extract Gingko biloba exhibits neuroprotective effects cerebral ischemia. mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) critical downstream effector Akt central regulator ribosomal biogenesis protein synthesis. investigated whether EGb 761 regulates Akt downstream targets, including mTOR, p70S6 kinase, S6 phosphorylation. Adult male rats treated vehicle EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) prior middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Brains collected 24 hours MCAO cerebral cortex regions examined. previously showed EGb 761 significantly reduces infarct volume decreases number TUNEL-positive cells cerebral cortex. Ischemic brain injury induces decrease Akt up-stream target, PDK1 phosphorylation. levels phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70S6 kinase, phospho-S6 subsequently decreased regions affected ischemic injury. However, EGb 761 prevented injury-induced decreases protein levels. confirmed EGb 761 inhibits injury-induced decreases number positive cells phospho-p70S6 kinase phospho-S6. results study provide evidence EGb 761 protects neuronal cells ischemic brain injury preventing injury-induced decreases p70S6 kinase S6 phosphorylation.
