 Pancreatic islet cytosol contains calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase mediate phosphorylation endogenous protein Mr 57 000, well exogenous muscle pyruvate kinase (subunit Mr, 57 000). EGTA trifluoperazine decreased phosphorylation. Alkaline inactivation pyruvate kinase made better substrate kinase. rat islet cytosol, rabbit islet cytosol catalyzed phosphorylation 57 000 Mr protein presence calcium calmodulin. phosphoprotein immunoprecipitated anti-pyruvate kinase antibody. consistent idea 57 000 Mr phosphoprotein islet cytosol subunit pyruvate kinase. paper following paper shows kinetic immunologic properties islet pyruvate kinase indicate M2 isoenzyme phosphorylation affect catalytic activity.
