 study pyruvate kinase, hexokinase aldolase investigated two types embryonal tumors, neuroblastomas medulloblastomas; results compared similar studies gliomas. activities hexokinase pyruvate kinase significantly decreased neuroblastomas. neuroblastoma medulloblastoma five forms pyruvate kinase (K4, K3M, K2M2, KM3 M4) present. contrast, gliomas investigated characterized presence mainly K4 little K3M. neuroblastomas, medulloblastomas gliomas, hexokinase type present; addition, hexokinase type II present two medulloblastomas. Aldolase predominant isozyme tumors investigated; contrast normal nervous tissue. concluded isozyme characteristics especially pyruvate kinase neuroblastomas medulloblastomas comparable similar findings retinoblastoma; findings support hypothesis three tumors common embryonic origin.
