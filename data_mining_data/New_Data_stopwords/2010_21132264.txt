 unique bioenergetic feature cancer, aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect, attractive therapeutic target cancer therapy. Reversing glycolytic phenotype may trigger apoptosis tumor cells. Recently, dichloroacetate (DCA) proven produce significant cytotoxic effects certain tumor cells distinct mechanism. study, effect DCA metabolism cervical cancer HeLa cells explored synergistic growth inhibition cisplatin also evaluated. intracellular changes HeLa cells following DCA exposure analyzed cell viability, intracellular H2O2 pH levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), expression apoptotic proteins Kv1.5 channel, intracellular-free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). evaluation combination chemotherapy, HeLa cells treated combination DCA cisplatin various concentrations 48 h. Cell viability determined CCK-8 assay synergy two agents evaluated using R index method. DCA shifted metabolism HeLa cells aerobic glycolysis glucose oxidation shown increased intracellular H2O2 pH levels. change metabolism modality led drop MMP increase apoptotic proteins (caspase 3 9). increased Kv1.5 expression decreased [Ca2+]i established positive feedback loop resulted reduced tonic inhibition caspases. Combination chemotherapy DCA cisplatin exhibited significant synergy inhibiting proliferation HeLa cells. specific apoptotic mechanism DCA distinguished cisplatin may partly responsible synergy vivo study combination chemotherapy two agents cervical cancer xenografts mice warranted.
