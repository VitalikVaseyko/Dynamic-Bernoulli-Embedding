 Hepatic glucokinase (GK) catalyzes phosphorylation glucose glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), step essential glucose metabolism liver well induction glycolytic lipogenic genes. sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) emerged major mediator insulin action hepatic gene expression, extent transcriptional effect caused increased glucose metabolism remains unclear. use hepatic GK knockout mice (hGK-KO) shown acute stimulation glucose l-pyruvate kinase (l-PK), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), Spot 14 genes requires GK expression. determine whether effect SREBP-1c requires GK expression subsequent glucose metabolism, transcriptionally active form SREBP-1c overexpressed vivo primary cultures control hGK-KO hepatocytes. results demonstrate synergistic action SREBP-1c glucose metabolism via GK necessary maximal induction l-PK, ACC, FAS, Spot 14 gene expression. Indeed, hGK-KO hepatocytes overexpressing SREBP-1c, effect glucose glycolytic lipogenic genes lost impaired ability hepatocytes efficiently metabolize glucose, despite marked increase low K(m) hexokinase activity. studies also reveal loss glucose effect observed hGK-KO hepatocytes associated decreased carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) gene expression, transcription factor suggested mediate glucose signaling liver. Decreased ChREBP gene expression, achieved using small interfering RNA, results loss glucose effect endogenous glycolytic (l-PK) lipogenic (FAS, ACC) gene expression, thereby demonstrating direct implication ChREBP glucose action. Together results support model whereby SREBP-1c glucose metabolism, acting via ChREBP, necessary dietary induction glycolytic lipogenic gene expression liver.
