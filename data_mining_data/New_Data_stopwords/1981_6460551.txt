 resting mycelia Aspergillus parasiticus NRRL 3240, glycolytic intermediates exception glucose phosphoenolpyruvate stimulated de novo synthesis aflatoxin exogenous acetate. Intracellular levels glycolytic intermediates measured toxigenic strain, A. parasiticus NRRL 3240, nontoxigenic strain, A. flavus NRRL 3537. 48-h cultures, concentrations intermediates beyond phosphofructokinase reaction higher toxigenic mycelial extracts nontoxigenic cultures. marked reduction specific activity phosphofructokinase increasing age toxigenic strain. specific activity enzyme two- four-fold lower zinc-deficient mycelia A. parasiticus. resting cultures, uptake rate labeled glucose considerably lower zinc-deficient mycelia zinc-replete nontoxigenic cultures. basis results obtained, said intense formation aflatoxin associated sharp fall level phosphoenolpyruvic pyruvic acids. accompanied significantly higher pyruvate kinase activity.
