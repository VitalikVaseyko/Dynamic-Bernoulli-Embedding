 Activities several metabolic enzymes show distinct patterns zonation along intestinal tract tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus). Zonation species enzyme specific, different metabolic activities concentrated specific areas, generalizations made. rockfish show smallest degree zonation, highest activities third quarter intestine, shallow gradients either side, general upswing activity towards distal end. trout, mitochondrial enzyme activities (citrate synthase, glutamate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase) highest pyloric caeca decrease along length small intestine. pattern accentuated malic enzyme glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. enzymes drop precipitously activity first sections small intestine, NADP-linked dehydrogenases (isocitrate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) show moderate activity pyloric caeca peak toward distal section small intestine. tilapia, glutamate dehydrogenase shows similar decrease trout, citrate synthase peaks towards distal sections. NADP-dependent dehydrogenases reveal distinct patterns, peaking different sections intestine-malic enzyme proximal midsection, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase distal mid-section, isocitrate dehydrogenase anal section. Enzyme activities stomach trout tilapia also show zonation, midsection generally displaying highest activities. 5-day treatment tilapia intraperitoneal cortisol deposit (25 mg kg(-1) wet mass) drastically alters metabolic performance along gut enzyme specific patterns, generally increasing enzyme activities site-specific arrangements. Cortisol treatment also leads expected increases activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase aspartate aminotransferase liver, kidney. Aspartate aminotransferase enzyme brain significantly increased cortisol treatment. Short-term food deprivation changes enzyme patterns, often resembling observed cortisol administration. conclude brain, liver intestinal amino acid metabolism important target cortisol action fish metabolic zonation key factor reckoned analyzing physiological phenomena fish intestine.
