 1. molecular weights subunits purified pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex determined sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-disc-gel electrophoresis were: pyruvate decarboxylase, alpha-subunit 40600, beta-subunit 35100; dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase 76100; dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase 58200. 2. Inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex integral kinase corresponded incorporation 0.46nmol P/unit complex activity inactivated. 3. incorporation phosphate complex occurred limit 1.27nmol P/unit complex inactivated (approx. 3 times required inactivation). 4. Phosphate incorporated alpha-subunit decarboxylase. 5. molar ratio phosphate alpha-subunits decarboxylase estimated radioamidination amino groups pyruvate dehydrogenase [(32)P]phosphate complex using methyl [1-(14)C]acetimidate, followed separation alpha-subunits sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-disc-gel electrophoresis. Inactivation complex (0.46nmol P/unit complex inactivated) corresponded molar ratio one phosphate group per two alpha-chains (i.e. one phosphate group/alpha(2)beta(2) tetramer). Complete phosphorylation corresponded three phosphate groups per alpha(2)beta(2) tetramer. 6. Subunit molar ratios complex also estimated radioamidination technique. Results corresponded closely molar ratios 4 alpha-subunits:4 beta-subunits:2 dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase subunits:1 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase subunit.
