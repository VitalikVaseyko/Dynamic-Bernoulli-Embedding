 fraction chromaffin granule membranes contained number substrates endogenous protein kinase activity well endogenous phosphatase activity. major 32P-labelled polypeptide molecular weight 43,000 appeared alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase residual mitochondria. Several polypeptides showed cyclic AMP stimulation phosphorylation major polypeptide molecular weight 59,000 shows half-maximal phosphorylation 0.49 microM cyclic AMP. phosphorylation several polypeptides inhibited high cyclic AMP concentrations. studies immunoprecipitation two-dimensional electrophoresis found alpha- beta-tubulin actin absent granule membranes. However 32P labelling proportion copies dopamine-beta-hydroxylase demonstrated. majority substrates endogenous protein kinase activity probably cytoplasmic side granule membrane.
