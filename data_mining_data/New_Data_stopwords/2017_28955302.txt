 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes transient increases subsequent decreases brain glucose utilization. underlying molecular pathways orchestrated processes poorly understood. current study, determined temporal changes cortical hippocampal expression genes important brain glucose/lactate metabolism effect known neuroprotective drug telmisartan expression genes experimental TBI. Adult male C57BL/6J mice (n = 6/group) underwent sham unilateral controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. ipsilateral contralateral cortex hippocampus collected 6 h, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 days injury. Expressions several genes important brain glucose utilization determined qRT-PCR. results, (1) mRNA levels three key enzymes glucose metabolism [hexo kinase (HK) 1, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)] increased 6 h injury contralateral cortex, followed decreases subsequent times ipsilateral cortex hippocampus; (2) capillary glucose transporter Glut-1 mRNA increased, neuronal glucose transporter Glut-3 mRNA decreased, various times ipsilateral cortex hippocampus; (3) astrocyte lactate transporter MCT-1 mRNA increased, whereas neuronal lactate transporter MCT-2 mRNA decreased ipsilateral cortex hippocampus; (4) HK2 (an isoform hexokinase) expression increased time points ipsilateral cortex hippocampus. GPR81 (lactate receptor) mRNA increased various time points ipsilateral cortex hippocampus. temporal alterations gene expression corresponded closely patterns impaired brain glucose utilization reported TBI patients experimental TBI rodents. observed changes hippocampal gene expression delayed prolonged, compared cortex. patterns alterations specific different brain regions exhibited different recovery periods following TBI. Oral administration telmisartan (1 mg/kg, 7 days, n = 10 per group) ameliorated cortical hippocampal mRNA Glut-1/3, MCT-1/2 PDH CCI mice. data provide molecular evidence dynamic alteration multiple critical factors brain glucose metabolism post-TBI inform research treating brain metabolic disorders post-TBI.
