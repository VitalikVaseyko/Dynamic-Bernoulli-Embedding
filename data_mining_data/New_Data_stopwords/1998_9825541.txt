 Axenic cultures Suillus bovinus cultivated inorganic liquid medium glucose carbon source 25 degrees C continuous supply oxygen aeration compressed air dark. Exogenous fructose sole carbon source yielded 50% less increase dry weight glucose. resulted different uptake velocities. Sucrose sole exogenous carbon source yielded measurable increase dry weight. glucose cultures, activities glycolytic enzymes found. Maximum specific activities varied largely (from 60 [fructose 6-phosphate kinase] 20,000 [triosephosphate isomerase] nmoles.mg protein-1.min-1). Apparent K(m)-values also varied two orders magnitude (0.035 mM [pyruvate kinase] 6.16 mM [triosephosphate isomerase]). Fructose 6-phosphate kinase proved fructose 2,6-bisphosphate-regulated type, aldolase divalent cation-dependent (class II) type glyceratephosphate mutase glycerate 2,3-phosphate-independent type respective enzymes. Eight 10 enzymes exhibited pH-optima 7.5-8.0. Triosephosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase showed highest activities pH 6.5. Regulatory sites within glycolytic pathway Suillus bovinus discussed; fructose 6-phosphate kinase appears main bottle neck.
