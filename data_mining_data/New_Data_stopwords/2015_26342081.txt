 insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling pathway (ISP) plays fundamental role long term health range organisms. Protein kinases including Akt ERK intimately involved ISP. identify kinases may participate pathway intersect regulatory manner, performed whole kinome (779 kinases) siRNA screen positive negative regulators ISP, using GLUT4 translocation cell surface output pathway activity. identified PFKFB3, positive regulator glycolysis highly expressed cancer cells adipocytes, positive ISP regulator. Pharmacological inhibition PFKFB3 suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation, Akt signaling 3T3-L1 adipocytes. contrast, overexpression PFKFB3 HEK293 cells potentiated insulin-dependent phosphorylation Akt Akt substrates. Furthermore, pharmacological modulation glycolysis 3T3-L1 adipocytes affected Akt phosphorylation. data add emerging body evidence metabolism plays central role regulating numerous biological processes including ISP. findings important implications diseases type 2 diabetes cancer characterized marked disruption metabolism growth factor signaling.
