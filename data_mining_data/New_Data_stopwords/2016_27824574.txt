 Herein, present pilot study concerning use fluorodeoxy glucose conjugated magnetite nanoparticles (FDG-mNP) potential agent magnetic nanoparticle mediated neuroblastoma cancer cell hyperthermia. approach makes use 'Warburg effect', utilizing fact cancer cells higher metabolic rate normal cells. FDG-mNP synthesized, applied SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cancer cell line exposed ac magnetic field. 3D Calorimetry performed FDG-mNP compound. Simulations performed using SEMCAD X software using Thelonious, (an anatomically correct male child model) order understand end requirements respect cancer cell destruction. investigated FDG-mNP mediated neuroblastoma cytotoxicity conjunction ac magnetic field exposure. Results presented 3D FDG-mNP SAR mnp (10.86 +/- 0.99 W/g particles) using therapeutic dose 0.83 mg/ mL. Human model simulations suggest 43 W/kg SAR Theo would required obtain 42 degrees C within centre liver tumor (Tumor size, bounding box x = 64, = 61, z = 65 [mm]), temperature distribution inhomogeneous within tumor. study suggests approach could potentially used increase temperature within cells would result cancer cell death due hyperthermia. development research also involve using whole tumors removed living organisms conjunction magnetic resonance imaging positron emission tomography.
