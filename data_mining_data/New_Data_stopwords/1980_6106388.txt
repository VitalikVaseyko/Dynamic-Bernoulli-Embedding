 Rats placed magnesium-deficient diet show decreased erythrocyte magnesium concentration, shortened erythrocyte survival, erythrocyte membrane ultrastructure defects become progressively anemic. Whether pathologic processes due abnormal erythropoiesis occur peripheral circulation unknown. present study, magnesium hemoglobin concentrations, reticulocyte count, erythrocyte pyrophosphatase, pyruvate kinase activities determined weekly intervals 6 weeks whole blood age-dependent erythrocyte fractions isolated inbred Fisher rats fed diet deficient magnesium diet added magnesium. Freeze-fracture electron microscopic examinations performed age-dependent erythrocyte fractions evaluate membrane defect. youngest red cells magnesium-deficient rats similar control animals respect erythrocyte magnesium concentrations, pyrophosphatase activities, membrane morphology. older erythrocyte fractions magnesium-deficient rats showed significant decreases magnesium concentrations, pyrophosphatase activity, presence membrane abnormalities. Thus, new erythrocytes produced magnesium-deficient rats appear normal rapidly develop biochemical morphologic abnormalities aging magnesium-deficient plasma environment.
