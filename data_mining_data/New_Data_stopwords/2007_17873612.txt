 OBJECTIVES: Immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FOBT) determination tumor pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (TuM2-PK) stool samples may valuable new screening tools colorectal cancer (CRC). aim study compare accuracy fecal TuM2-PK testing immunochemical FOBT patients CRC adenomas. METHODS: total 52 patients CRC analyzed, 47 colorectal adenomas, 63 matched controls normal colonoscopy. Nineteen additional patients inflammatory bowel disease tested determine influence inflammation. Stool samples analyzed two immunochemical FOBTs, Immo-care OC-Light, commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay TuM2-PK. RESULTS: patients CRC, sensitivity TuM2-PK, Immo-care OC-Light respectively 85, 92 94%. patients adenomas, sensitivity respectively 28, 40 34%. Specificity tests 90% TuM2-PK 97% immunochemical FOBTs. tests showed high positivity rate patients inflammatory bowel disease (79% TuM2-PK Immo-care, 89% OC-Light). CONCLUSION: immunochemical FOBTs appear valuable sensitive tests CRC screening. TuM2-PK supplemental value screening CRC lower sensitivity specificity. None tests sensitive enough detection advanced adenomas. Patients inflammatory bowel disease excluded CRC screening using immunochemical FOBT TuM2-PK.
