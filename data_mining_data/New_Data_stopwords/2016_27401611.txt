 UNLABELLED: Growth arrest-specific 1 (Gas1) plays critical role growth suppression. Previous study indicated Gas1 closely associated survival patients colorectal cancer; however, underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. study, sought determine role Gas1 tumorigenesis metastasis, elucidate possible mechanism. First, Gas1 determined negative regulator oncogenesis metastasis colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, Gas1 negatively regulated aerobic glycolysis, process contributed tumor progression metastasis providing energy source building blocks macromolecule synthesis. consolidate role Gas1 glycolysis, impact Gas1 transcription key glycolytic enzymes glucose utilization examined. expected, GLUT4, HK2, LDHB exhibited decreased expression pattern. Consistent observation, vivo subcutaneous xenograft mouse model also confirmed hypothesis Gas1 negative regulator glycolysis reflected decreased 18FDG uptake PET/CT system. Moreover, Gas1 negatively regulated AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling axis, well-established cascade regulates malignant cancer cell behaviors including proliferation, metastasis, aberrant cancer metabolism. end, determined Gas1 transcriptional target FOXM1, whose role colorectal cancer widely studied. Taken together, studies establish Gas1 negative regulator colorectal cancer. IMPLICATIONS: Gas1 suppresses cell proliferation, invasion, aerobic glycolysis colorectal cancer vitro vivo Mechanistically, Gas1 inhibited EMT Warburg effect via AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling, Gas1 directly regulated transcription factor FOXM1.
