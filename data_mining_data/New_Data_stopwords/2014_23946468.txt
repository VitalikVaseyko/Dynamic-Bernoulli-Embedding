 Thioredoxin (Trx) GSH major thiol antioxidants protecting cells oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity. Redox states Trx GSH used indicators oxidative stress. Accumulating studies suggest Trx GSH redox systems regulate cell signaling metabolic pathways differently independently diverse stressful conditions. current study, used mass spectrometry-based redox proteomics approach test responses cysteine (Cys) proteome selective disruption Trx- GSH-dependent systems. Auranofin (ARF) used inhibit Trx reductase without detectable oxidation GSH/GSSG couple, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) used deplete GSH without detectable oxidation Trx1. Results 606 Cys-containing peptides (peptidyl Cys) showed 36% oxidized 1.3-fold ARF, whereas BSO-induced oxidation peptidyl Cys 10%. Mean fold oxidation peptides also higher ARF BSO treatment. Analysis potential functional pathways showed ARF oxidized peptides associated glycolysis, cytoskeleton remodeling, translation cell adhesion. 60 peptidyl Cys oxidized due depletion GSH, 41 also oxidized ARF included proteins translation cell adhesion glycolysis cytoskeletal remodeling. Studies test functional correlates showed pyruvate kinase activity lactate levels decreased ARF BSO, confirming effects glycolysis-associated proteins sensitive oxidation ARF. data show Trx system regulates broader range proteins GSH system, support distinct function Trx GSH cellular redox control, show first time mammalian cells selective targeting peptidyl Cys biological pathways due deficient function Trx system.
