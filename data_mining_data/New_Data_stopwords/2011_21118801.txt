 Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) critical activator multiple prosurvival oncogenic protein kinases garnered considerable interest oncology drug target. Despite progress characterizing PDK1 therapeutic target, pharmacological support lacking due prevalence nonspecific inhibitors. Here, benchmark literature newly developed inhibitors conduct parallel genetic pharmacological queries PDK1 function cancer cells. kinase selectivity profiling x-ray crystallographic studies, identify exquisitely selective PDK1 inhibitor (compound 7) uniquely binds inactive kinase conformation (DFG-out). contrast compounds 1-5, classical ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors (DFG-in), compound 7 specifically inhibits cellular PDK1 T-loop phosphorylation (Ser-241), supporting unique binding mode. Interfering PDK1 activity minimal antiproliferative effect cells growing plastic-attached monolayer cultures (i.e. standard tissue culture conditions) despite reduced phosphorylation AKT, RSK, S6RP. However, selective PDK1 inhibition impairs anchorage-independent growth, invasion, cancer cell migration. Compound 7 inhibits colony formation subset cancer cell lines (four 10) primary xenograft tumor lines (nine 57). RNAi-mediated knockdown corroborates PDK1 dependence cell lines identifies candidate biomarkers drug response. summary, profiling studies define uniquely selective cell-potent PDK1 inhibitor, convergence genetic pharmacological phenotypes supports role PDK1 tumorigenesis context three-dimensional vitro culture systems.
