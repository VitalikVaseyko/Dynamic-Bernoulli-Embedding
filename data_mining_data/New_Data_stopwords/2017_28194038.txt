 Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3/ITD) represents unfavorable genetic change acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated poor prognosis. Metabolic alterations involved tumor progression attracted interest target therapeutic intervention. However, studies analyzed adaptations cellular metabolism context FLT3/ITD mutation. Here, report FLT3/ITD causes significant increase aerobic glycolysis AKT-mediated upregulation mitochondrial hexokinase (HK2), renders leukemia cells highly dependent glycolysis sensitive pharmacological inhibition glycolytic activity. Inhibition glycolysis preferentially causes severe ATP depletion massive cell death FLT3/ITD leukemia cells. Glycolytic inhibitors significantly enhances cytotoxicity induced FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Importantly, combination provides substantial therapeutic benefit murine model bearing FLT3/ITD leukemia. study suggests FLT3/ITD mutation promotes Warburg effect, metabolic alteration exploited develop effective therapeutic strategy treatment AML FLT3/ITD mutation via metabolic intervention.
