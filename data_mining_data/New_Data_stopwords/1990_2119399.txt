 activities tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.11), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.17), kynurenine 3-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.9), kynureninase (EC 3.7.1.3), kynurenine transaminases, pyridoxal phosphokinase (EC 2.7.1.35) liver, kidney lung rats measured administration single dose repeated doses dimethoate, carbaryl fenvalerate, respectively. Ten percent LD50 insecticide orally administered rat single dose, 5% LD50 orally given five consecutive days repeated doses. control animals received volume vehicle (polyethylene glycol 300). Body weight organs weight losses recognized repeated doses dimethoate, protein content remained constant compared control animals. Repeated administration dimethoate caused significant decrease activity kynurenine 3-hydroxylase (28.3% decrease liver, 32.5% kidney), kynurenine-pyruvate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.7) (40% liver, 24.2% kidney), kynurenine- pyruvate transaminase (EC 2.6.1-) (24.5% kidney) pyridoxal phosphokinase (36.1% liver). Repeated doses carbaryl resulted significant decrease activity apo-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (42.8%), kynurenine-2-oxoglutarate transaminase (40% liver), kynurenine-pyruvate transaminase (30.6% liver), serine-glyoxylate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.51) (47.9% liver). Externally added insecticides different concentrations incubation mixture resulted inhibition tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, enzymes examined showed change activities.
