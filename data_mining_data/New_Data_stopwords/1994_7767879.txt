 Smooth muscle made permeable alpha-toxin beta-escin. ATPase activity measured using phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase regenerating system ATP monitored NADH fluorescence changes, Ca2+ measured using fura 2 fluorescence. alpha-Toxin-and beta-escin-treated bundles cells high ATPase activity, reduced 80% exposed 1% Triton X-100. Triton-sensitive ATPase activity increased approximately 20% GTP GTP gamma added solutions much greater magnitude Ca(2+)-activated ATPase associated contraction. high membrane ATPase activity cause gradient ATP ADP bundle cells. Thus modulation ATPase G-protein-receptor mechanisms could alter force constant Ca2+ concentration changing ADP/ATP ratio within cells. Measurements fura 2 fluorescence ratio (340/380) alpha-toxin-treated bundles cells following sudden changes extracellular Ca2+ showed cells freely permeable Ca EGTA. Similar experiments beta-escin-treated cells showed cells much permeable Ca EGTA. experiments indicate great care must taken alpha-toxin- beta-escin-treated fibers make sure intracellular ATP, ADP, Ca2+ held constant.
