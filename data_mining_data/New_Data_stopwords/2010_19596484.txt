 Seedlings sour pummelo (Citrus grandis) irrigated daily 18 weeks nutrient solution containing four phosphorus (P) levels (50, 100, 250 500 microM KH2PO4) two aluminum (Al) levels [0 (-Al) 1.2 mM AlCl3 x 6H2O (+Al)]. malate citrate concentrations +Al leaves decreased increasing P supply, concentrations -Al leaves change response P supply. concentrations malate 50 microM P citrate 50 100 microM P higher +Al leaves -Al ones, malate concentration lower +Al leaves -Al ones 500 microM P. difference root malate citrate concentrations among different P Al combinations except increase malate citrate 50 microM P+0 mM Al slight decrease malate 50 microM P+1.2 mM Al. activities acid-metabolizing enzymes (citrate synthase, aconitase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase, NAD-malate dehydrogenase, NADP-malic enzyme pyruvate kinase) cases less affected P Al interactions roots compared leaves. results support hypothesis changes organic acid metabolism differ roots leaves C. grandis response P Al interactions.
