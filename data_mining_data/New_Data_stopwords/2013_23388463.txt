 Cigarette smoke directly implicated disease pathogenesis plethora different human cancer subtypes, including breast cancers. prevailing view cigarette smoke acts mutagen DNA damaging agent normal epithelial cells, driving tumor initiation. However, potential negative metabolic effects normal stromal microenvironment largely ignored. Here, propose new mechanism carcinogen-rich cigarette smoke may promote cancer growth, metabolically "fertilizing" host microenvironment. specifically, show cigarette smoke exposure indeed sufficient drive onset cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype via induction DNA damage, autophagy mitophagy tumor stroma. turn, cigarette smoke exposure induces premature aging mitochondrial dysfunction stromal fibroblasts, leading secretion high-energy mitochondrial fuels, L-lactate ketone bodies. Hence, cigarette smoke induces catabolism local microenvironment, directly fueling oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) neighboring epithelial cancer cells, actively promoting anabolic tumor growth. Remarkably, autophagic-senescent fibroblasts increased breast cancer tumor growth vivo 4-fold. Importantly, show cigarette smoke-induced metabolic reprogramming fibroblastic stroma occurs independently tumor neo-angiogenesis. discuss possible implications current findings prevention aging-associated human diseases and, especially, common epithelial cancers, show cigarette smoke systemically accelerate aging host microenvironment. Finally, current findings consistent idea cigarette smoke induces "reverse Warburg effect," thereby fueling "two-compartment tumor metabolism" oxidative mitochondrial metabolism epithelial cancer cells.
