 Copper essential trace element, imbalances associated various pathological conditions, including cancer, albeit via largely undefined molecular cellular mechanisms. provide evidence levels bioavailable copper modulate tumor growth. Chronic exposure elevated levels copper drinking water, corresponding maximum allowed public water supplies, stimulated proliferation cancer cells de novo pancreatic tumor growth mice. Conversely, reducing systemic copper levels chelating drug, clinically used treat copper disorders, impaired both. copper limitation, tumors displayed decreased activity copper-binding mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase reduced ATP levels, despite enhanced glycolysis, accompanied increased invasiveness tumors. antiproliferative effect copper chelation enhanced combined inhibitors glycolysis. Interestingly, larger tumors contained less copper smaller tumors exhibited comparatively lower activity cytochrome c oxidase increased glucose uptake. results establish copper tumor promoter reveal varying levels copper serves regulate oxidative phosphorylation rapidly proliferating cancer cells inside solid tumors. Thus, activation glycolysis tumors may part reflect insufficient copper bioavailability tumor microenvironment.
