 Catabolism carbohydrates implicated regulation aflatoxin synthesis. characterize effect further, activities various enzymes associated glucose catabolism determined Aspergillus parasiticus organisms initially cultured peptone-mineral salts medium transferred glucose-mineral salts peptone-mineral salts media. initial increase activity, levels glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, mannitol dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase lowered presence glucose. Phosphofructokinase activity greater peptone-grown mycelium, fructose diphosphatase largely unaffected carbon source. Likewise, carbon source relatively little effect activities pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, isocitrate-NADP dehydrogenase, isocitrate-NAD dehydrogenase. results suggest glucose may, part, regulate aflatoxin synthesis via carbon catabolite repression NADPH-generating tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes.
