 1. metabolic response livers perfusion ethanol without avenaciolide, followed measuring perfusate levels glucose, lactate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, ethanol, amino acids, urea lipid. 2. Analysis perfused livers showed changes activities key enzymes glycolysis, gluconeogenesis lipogenesis. Ethanol perfusion decreased levels phosphofructokinase, glucokinase cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase, avenaciolide lowered pyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase well glucokinase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase phosphofructokinase unchanged, ionophore increased level fructose-1,6-diphosphatase. Ethanol plus avenaciolide showed pattern ethanol alone, together decrease phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase found avenaciolide. 3. Neither ethanol avenaciolide effect kexokinase, pyruvate kinase acetyl-CoA carboxylase. small changes glucose-6-phosphatase malic enzyme, tendency citrate lyase levels decline avenaciolide perfusions.
