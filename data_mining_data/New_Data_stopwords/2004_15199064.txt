 skeletal muscle specific Ca(2)+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKIIbeta(M)) localized sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) anchoring protein, alphaKAP, function remains defined. Protein interactions CaMKIIbeta(M) indicated exists complex enzymes involved glycolysis SR membrane. kinase found complex glycogen phosphorylase, glycogen debranching enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), creatine kinase SR membrane. CaMKIIbeta(M) also found assemble aldolase A, GAPDH, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphorylase b kinase cytosolic fraction. interacting proteins substrates CaMKIIbeta(M), phosphorylation enhanced Ca(2+)- calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner. CaMKIIbeta(M) could directly phosphorylate GAPDH markedly increase ( approximately 3.4-fold) activity Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent manner. data suggest muscle CaMKIIbeta(M) isoform may serve assemble glycogen-mobilizing glycolytic enzymes SR membrane specifically modulate activity GAPDH response calcium signaling. Thus, activation CaMKIIbeta(M) response calcium signaling would serve modulate GAPDH thereby ATP NADH levels SR membrane, turn regulate calcium transport processes.
