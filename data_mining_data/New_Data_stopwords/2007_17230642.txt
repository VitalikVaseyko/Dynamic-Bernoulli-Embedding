 present study investigated effect intrastriatal administration 150 nmol quinolinic acid young rats critical enzyme activities energy production transfer, well 14CO2 production [1-14C]acetate distinct periods quinolinic acid injection. observed quinolinic acid injection significantly inhibited complexes II (50%), III (46%) II-III (35%), well creatine kinase (27%), activities complexes IV citrate synthase striatum prepared 12 h treatment. contrast, alterations enzyme activities observed 3 6 h quinolinic acid administration. 14CO2 production [1-14C]acetate also significantly inhibited (27%) quinolinic acid rat striatum prepared 12 h injection. However, alterations activities observed striatum homogenates incubated presence 100 microm quinolinic acid . Pretreatment NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 creatine totally prevented inhibitory effects elicited quinolinic acid administration. addition, alpha-tocopherol plus ascorbate nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-NAME completely abolished inhibitions provoked quinolinic acid creatine kinase complex III. Furthermore, pyruvate pretreatment totally blocked inhibitory effects quinolinic acid injection complex II activity partially prevented quinolinic acid-induced creatine kinase inhibition. observations strongly indicate oxidative phosphorylation, citric acid cycle cellular energy transfer compromised high concentrations quinolinic acid striatum young rats inhibitory effects probably mediated NMDA stimulation.
