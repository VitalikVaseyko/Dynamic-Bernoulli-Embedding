 Thoroughbred horses selected exceptional racing performance resulting system-wide structural functional adaptations contributing elite athletic phenotypes. selection recent intense closed population stems small number founder animals Thoroughbreds represent unique population within identify genomic contributions exercise-related traits. Employing population genetics-based hitchhiking mapping approach performed genome scan using 394 autosomal X chromosome microsatellite loci identified positively selected loci extreme tail-ends empirical distributions (1) deviations expected heterozygosity (Ewens-Watterson test) Thoroughbred (n = 112) (2) global differentiation among four geographically diverse horse populations (F(ST)). found positively selected genomic regions Thoroughbred enriched phosphoinositide-mediated signalling (3.2-fold enrichment; P<0.01), insulin receptor signalling (5.0-fold enrichment; P<0.01) lipid transport (2.2-fold enrichment; P<0.05) genes. found significant overrepresentation sarcoglycan complex (11.1-fold enrichment; P<0.05) focal adhesion pathway (1.9-fold enrichment; P<0.01) genes highlighting role muscle strength integrity Thoroughbred athletic phenotype. report first time candidate athletic-performance genes within regions targeted selection Thoroughbred horses principally responsible fatty acid oxidation, increased insulin sensitivity muscle strength: ACSS1 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 1), ACTA1 (actin, alpha 1, skeletal muscle), ACTN2 (actinin, alpha 2), ADHFE1 (alcohol dehydrogenase, iron containing, 1), MTFR1 (mitochondrial fission regulator 1), PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4) TNC (tenascin C).
