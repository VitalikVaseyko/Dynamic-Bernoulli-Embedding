 Improving child cognition impoverished countries public health priority. Yet, biological pathways associated biomarkers impaired cognition remain poorly understood largely unknown, respectively. study aimed explore quantify associations functional plasma protein biomarkers childhood intellectual test performance. applied proteomics quantify proteins plasma samples 249 rural Nepalese children, 6-8years age who, 1year later 7-9years age, administered Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test (UNIT). Among 751 plasma proteins quantified, 22 associated UNIT scores, passing false discovery rate threshold 5.0% (q<0.05). UNIT scores higher 2.3-9.2 points every 50% increase relative abundance two insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), six subclasses apolipoprotein (Apo) transthyretin, lower 4.0-15.3 points 50% increase relative abundance 13 proteins predominantly involved inflammation. Among them, IGFBP-acid labile subunit, orosomucoid 1 (ORM1), Apo C-I, pyruvate kinase isoenzymes M1/M2 jointly explained 37% variance UNIT scores. additional adjustment height-for-age Z-score household socio-economic status indicators long-term nutritional social stress, associations 6 proteins involved inflammation, including ORM1, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, reticulocalbin 1, 3 components complement cascade, remained significant (q<0.05). Using untargeted proteomics, stable, constitutive facets subclinical inflammation associated lower developmental test performance rural South Asian child population. Plasma proteomics may offer opportunities identify functional, antecedent biomarkers child cognitive development.
