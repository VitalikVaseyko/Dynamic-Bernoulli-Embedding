 Oncometabolites defined small-molecule components (or enantiomers) normal metabolism whose accumulation causes signaling dysregulation establish milieu initiates carcinogenesis. similar manner, propose term "gerometabolites" refer small-molecule components normal metabolism whose depletion causes signaling dysregulation establish milieu drives aging. investigation pathogenic activities currently recognized oncometabolites R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), fumarate, succinate, accumulate due mutations isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH), fumarate hydratase (FH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), respectively, illustrate fact metabolic pseudohypoxia, accumulation hypoxia-inducible factor (HIFalpha) normoxic conditions, subsequent Warburg-like reprogramming shifts glucose metabolism oxidative pathway aerobic glycolysis mechanisms decline "gerometabolite" nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)(+) reversibly disrupts nuclear-mitochondrial communication contributes decline mitochondrial function age. evolutionary perspective, reasonable view NAD(+)-driven mitochondrial homeostasis conserved response changes energy supplies oxygen levels. Similarly, natural ability 2-HG significantly alter epigenetics might reflect evolutionarily ancient role certain metabolites signal elevated glutamine/glutamate metabolism and/or oxygen deficiency. However, chronically altered, responses become conserved causes aging cancer. HIFalpha-driven pseudohypoxia might drive overproduction 2-HG, intriguing possibility exists decline gerometabolites NAD(+) could promote chronic accumulation oncometabolites normal cells aging. sole activation Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming normal tissues might able significantly increase endogenous production bona fide etiological determinants cancer, oncometabolites, undesirable trade-off mitochondrial dysfunction activation oncometabolites production might pave way epigenetic initiation carcinogenesis strictly metabolic-dependent manner. Perhaps time definitely adopt view aging aging diseases including cancer governed pivotal regulatory role metabolic reprogramming cell fate decisions.
