 Tropidurid lizards colonized variety Brazilian open environments without remarkable morphological variation, despite ecological structural differences among habitats used. study focuses two Tropidurus sister-species that, despite systematic proximity similar morphology, exhibit great ecological divergence third ecologically generalist congeneric species providing outgroup comparison. quantified jumping capacity sprint speed species sand rock test whether ecological divergence also accompanied differences locomotor performance. Relevant physiological traits possibly associated locomotor performance - metabolic scopes fiber type composition, power output activity enzymes citrate synthase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase iliofibularis muscle - also compared among three Tropidurus species. found two sister-species exhibited remarkable differences jumping performance, Tropidurus oreadicus, distantly related species, exhibited intermediate values. Tropidurus psamonastes, species endemic sand dunes, exhibited high absolute sprint speeds sand, jumped rarely possessed high proportion glycolytic fibers low activity citrate synthase. sister-species Tropidurus itambere, endemic rocky outcrops, performed large number jumps achieved lower absolute sprint speed T. psamonastes. study provides evidence rapid divergence locomotor parameters sister-species use different substrates, partially explained variation physiological parameters iliofibularis muscle.
