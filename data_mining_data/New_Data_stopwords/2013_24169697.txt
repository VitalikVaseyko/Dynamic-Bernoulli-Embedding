 Unlike normal differentiated cells, tumor cells metabolize glucose via glycolysis aerobic conditions, hallmark cancer known Warburg effect. Cells lacking commonly mutated tumor suppressor PTEN exhibit glycolytic phenotype reminiscent Warburg effect. traditionally attributed hyperactivation PI3K/Akt signaling results PTEN loss. Here, propose novel mechanism whereby loss PTEN negatively affects activity E3 ligase APC/C-Cdh1, resulting stabilization enzyme PFKFB3 increased synthesis product fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P2). discovered compared wild-type cells, PTEN knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PTEN KO MEF) 2-3-fold higher concentrations F2,6P2, potent allosteric activator glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). Reintroduction either wild-type phosphatase mutant PTEN PTEN KO cells effectively lowers F2,6P2 wild-type levels reduces lactate production. PTEN KO cells found high protein levels PFKFB3, directly contribute increased concentrations F2,6P2. PTEN enhances interaction PFKFB3 Cdh1, overexpression Cdh1 down-regulates PFKFB3 protein level wild-type, PTEN-deficient cells. Importantly, found degradation endogenous PFKFB3 PTEN KO cells occurs slower rate wild-type cells. results suggest important role F2,6P2 metabolic reprogramming PTEN-deficient cells important consequences cell proliferation.
