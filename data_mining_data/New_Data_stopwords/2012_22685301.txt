 beta-Adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) promote brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis mobilizing fatty acids inducing expression oxidative genes. beta-AR activation increases expression oxidative genes elevating cAMP, whether lipolytic products modulate gene expression known. study examined role adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) plays induction gene expression. Activation brown adipocytes beta-AR agonism 8-bromo-cyclic AMP increased expression PGC1alpha, PDK4, PPARalpha, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1), concurrent inhibition HSL reduced induction PGC1alpha, PDK4, PPARalpha, UCP1 NOR-1. Similar results observed BAT mice following pharmacological genetic inhibition HSL brown adipocytes stable knockdown ATGL. Conversely, treatments increase endogenous fatty acids elevated expression oxidative genes. Pharmacological antagonism siRNA knockdown indicate PPARalpha PPARdelta modulate induction oxidative genes beta-AR agonism. Using live cell fluorescent reporter assay PPAR activation, demonstrated ligands PPARalpha -delta, PPARgamma, rapidly generated lipid droplet surface could transcriptionally activate PPARalpha -delta. Knockdown ATGL reduced cAMP-mediated induction genes involved fatty acid oxidation oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently, ATGL knockdown reduced maximal oxidation fatty acids, pyruvate, response cAMP stimulation. Overall, results indicate lipolytic products activate PPARalpha PPARdelta brown adipocytes, thereby expanding oxidative capacity match enhanced fatty acid supply.
