 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) one leading causes cancer death China. present study, proteins tumors adjacent normal esophageal tissues 41 patients ESCC extracted, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) performed using pH 3-10 4-7 immobilized pH gradient strips. protein spots expressed differentially tumors normal tissues identified matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization liquid chromatography electrospray/ionization ion trap mass spectrometry. total 22 proteins differentially expressed ESCC normal esophageal tissues identified, 17 proteins upregulated 5 downregulated tumors. Biological functions proteins related cell signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell motility, glycolysis, regulation transcription, oxidative stress processes, protein folding. proteins obtained confirmed Western blotting immunohistochemical staining. showed high expression calreticulin 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) correlated poor prognosis Kaplan-Meier analysis log rank analysis. Zinc finger protein 410, annexin V, similar ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1 isoform c, mutant hemoglobin beta chain, TPM4-ALK fusion oncoprotein type 2, similar heat shock congnate 71-kDa protein, GRP78, pyruvate kinase M2 (M2-PK) first time observed dysregulated human ESCC tissues. proteins identified contribute understanding tumorigenesis progression Chinese ESCC may potentially provide useful markers diagnosis targets therapeutic intervention drug development.
