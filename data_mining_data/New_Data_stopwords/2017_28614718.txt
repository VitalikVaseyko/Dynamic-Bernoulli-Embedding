 LPS-activated macrophages undergo metabolic shift dependence mitochondria-produced ATP reliance aerobic glycolysis, PKM2 critical determinant. Here, show PKM2 physiological substrate SIRT5 SIRT5-regulated hypersuccinylation inhibits pyruvate kinase activity PKM2 promoting tetramer-to-dimer transition. Moreover, succinylation-mimetic PKM2 K311E mutation promotes nuclear accumulation increases protein kinase activity. Furthermore, show SIRT5-dependent succinylation promotes PKM2 entry nucleus, complex PKM2-HIF1alpha formed promoter IL-1beta gene LPS-stimulated macrophages. Activation PKM2 using TEPP-46 attenuates Sirt5-deficiency-mediated IL-1beta upregulation LPS-stimulated macrophages. Finally, find Sirt5-deficient mice susceptible DSS-induced colitis, associated Sirt5 deficiency prompted PKM2 hypersuccinylation boosted IL-1beta production. conclusion, findings reveal mechanism SIRT5 suppresses pro-inflammatory response macrophages least part regulating PKM2 succinylation, activity, function.
