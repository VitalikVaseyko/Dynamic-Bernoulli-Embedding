 Pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) Mycobacterium smegmatis purified homogeneity seven-step procedure yield 16% specific activity 220 units/mg protein. purified enzyme molecular weight 230,700 composed four subunits identical molecular weights 57,540. Analysis amino acid composition revealed low content aromatic amino acids. enzyme exhibited sigmoidal kinetics varying concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate, degree cooperativity S0.5v value phosphoenolpyruvate strongly dependent pH reaction mixture. Among nucleoside diphosphates acting substrate pyruvate kinase, ADP best phosphate acceptor, judged lowest Km value. enzyme showed absolute requirement divalent cations (either Mg2+ Mn2+), monovalent cations necessary activity. divalent cations inhibited Mg2+-activated enzyme varying degrees (Ni2+ greater Zn2+ greater Cu2+ greater Ca2+ greater Ba2+). differences kinetic responses enzyme Mg2+ Mn2+ discussed.
