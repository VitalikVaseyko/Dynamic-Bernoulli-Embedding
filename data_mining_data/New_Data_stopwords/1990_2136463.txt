 authors tested three ways freezing red cell concentrates glycerin. -30 degrees C deep freezer; Planer rate 1 degree C per minute immersion liquid nitrogen -196 degrees C, stored cryo-containers liquid nitrogen. samples processed three ways, incl. follow-up glycolysis red cell concentrates acid-citrate-dextrose solution, levels following enzymes assessed: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, pyruvate kinase. addition also levels sodium, potassium, pH glucose assessed. enzyme estimations three mentioned enzymes triple rinsing saline samples immersed liquid nitrogen -196 degrees C acceptable values smallest losses rinsing.
