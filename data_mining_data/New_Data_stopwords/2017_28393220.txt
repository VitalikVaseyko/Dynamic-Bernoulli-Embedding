 Multiple drug resistance reported major obstacle treatment osteosarcoma (OS). Research demonstrated small subsets cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs) responsible multiple drug resistance. CSCs potential targets reversing chemoresistance. present study, compared cisplatin sensitivity OS stem cells OS non-stem cells. confirmed OS stem cells showed significant cisplatin-resistance compared OS non-CSCs. Mechanically, proved overexpression pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) responsible resistance cisplatin OS stem cells. potential strategy, found co-treatment metformin significantly decreased half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) cisplatin HOS OS stem cells downregulating expression PKM2. PKM2 downregulation resulted in, metformin inhibited glucose uptake, lactate production ATP production HOS CSCs. Therefore, metformin impaired resistance HOS CSCs cisplatin promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis. addition, antitumor effects chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin 5-fluorouracil proved enhanced metformin OS stem cells.
