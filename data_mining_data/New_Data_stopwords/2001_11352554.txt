 possible effects zinc modulation activity glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction isolated digestive gland cells mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.) investigated. Addition micromolar concentrations zinc resulted time- concentration-dependent stimulation glycolytic enzyme activities similar previously observed insulin; however, zinc pretreatment prevented glycolytic effect insulin mussel cells. insulin-like effect zinc mediated increased tyrosine phosphorylation multiple proteins, demonstrated Western blotting antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. pattern zinc-induced phosphorylation resembled induced insulin. Moreover, zinc insulin induced activation mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs); however, whereas zinc gave clear effect stress-activated p-38 MAPK, insulin activated extracellular-activated MAPK (ERK2) inhibited p-38. results demonstrate zinc act physiological regulator tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signaling mussel digestive gland cells, particular level MAPK activation. Activation p-38 zinc may key step prevention glycolytic effect insulin mussel cells. data underline importance cross talk different MAPKs determination response extracellular stimuli marine invertebrate cells.
