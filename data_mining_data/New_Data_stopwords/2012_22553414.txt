 aimed find clinically relevant gene activities ruled signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3) proteins ER(-) breast cancer population via network approach. STAT3 negatively associated lymph nodal category stage. MYC component STAT3 network. MYC STAT3 may co-regulate gene expressions Warburg effect, stem cell like phenotype, cell proliferation angiogenesis. identified STAT3 network silico showing ability predicting target gene expressions primarily specific tumor subtype, tumor progression, treatment options prognostic features. aberrant expressions MYC STAT3 enriched triple negatives (TN). promote histological grade, vascularity, metastasis tumor anti-apoptotic activities. VEGFA, STAT3, FOXM1 METAP2 druggable targets. High levels METAP2, MMP7, IGF2 IGF2R unfavorable prognostic factors. STAT3 inferred center regulator early cancer development predominantly TN.
