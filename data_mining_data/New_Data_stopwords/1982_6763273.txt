 Pyruvate kinase, activated fructose-1,6-biphosphate Salmonella typhimurium LT-2, isolated purified homogeneity. enzyme, similar Escherichia coli, tetramer approximate molecular weight 240,000. native enzyme shows optimum pH 6.8 (T = 30 degrees C). enzymatic reaction require K+ ions; Mg2+ Mn2+ essential activity. non-activated enzyme shows sigmoid kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate Hill coefficient 2.73; activated enzyme becomes michaelian KSADP KSPEP 0.25 0.08 mM, respectively. substrates excess ATP cause enzyme inhibition. agreement experimental results steady-state random-ordered hybrid Bi-Bi mechanism two dead-end complexes proposed.
