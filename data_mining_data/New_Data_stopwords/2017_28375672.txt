 Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) currently considered intracellular organelle "hot spot" intracellular signaling. MAMs thought function cellular energy homeostasis, apoptosis, calcium signaling. MAM ultrastructure surgical specimens human astrocytic neoplasms studied. Abnormalities respect density, length, width found. Poorly differentiated glioma like-stem cells deficient MAM well-differentiated glioma cells abundant MAM observed. finding could structural basis functional role MAM linked metabolic abnormalities astrocytic tumors associated mitochondrial dysfunction Warburg effect therapeutics implications.
