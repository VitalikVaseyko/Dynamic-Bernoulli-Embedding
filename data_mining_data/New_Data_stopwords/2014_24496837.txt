 Previous studies laboratory suggested differential expression genes normal pale, soft, exudative (PSE) turkey associated development PSE syndrome. However, detailed understanding molecular mechanisms responsible development meat defect remains unclear. objective study extend complement previous work using deep transcriptome RNA sequence analysis compare respective transcriptome profiles identify molecular mechanisms responsible etiology PSE turkey meat. Turkey breasts (n = 43) previously classified normal PSE using marinade uptake indicator quality (high = normal; low = PSE). Total RNA breast muscle samples highest (n = 4) lowest (n = 4) marinade uptake isolated sequenced using Illumina GA(IIX) platform. results indicated differential expression 494 loci (false discovery rate < 0.05). Changes gene expression confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR. Pathway analysis differentially expressed genes suggested abnormalities calcium homeostasis signaling pathways regulating actin cytoskeleton structure well carbohydrate metabolism energy production PSE samples. Dysregulation postmortem glucose oxidation PSE turkey suggested dramatic downregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4) mRNA, downregulated gene, decrease protein product (P = 0.0007) determined immunoblot analysis. results support hypothesis differential expression several genes protein products contribute development PSE turkey.
