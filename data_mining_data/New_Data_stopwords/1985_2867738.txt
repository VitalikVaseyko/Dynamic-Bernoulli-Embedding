 Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens C18 found possess glutamine synthetase (GS), urease, glutamate dehydrogenase, several nitrogen assimilation enzymes. grown continuous culture ammonia limitation, GS urease activities high glutamate dehydrogenase activity low, opposite activity pattern observed growth presence ample ammonia. addition high-level (15 mM) ammonium chloride ammonia-limited cultures resulted rapid loss GS activity measured either gamma-glutamyl transferase forward assay method cells extracts. similar activity losses occurred urease, glutamate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase. GS activity loss prevented addition chloramphenicol rifampin. GS activity could recovered washing incubating cells buffer addition snake venom phosphodiesterase cell extracts. Manganese inhibited GS activity (forward assay) untreated cells stimulated GS activity ammonia-treated cells. Alanine, glycine, possibly serine inhibitory GS activity. Optimal pH values GS activity 7.3 7.4 forward gamma-glutamyl transferase assays, respectively. glutamate dehydrogenase activity NADPH linked optimal presence KCl. data consistent adenylylation-deadenylylation control mechanism GS activity S. dextrinosolvens, GS pathway major route ammonia assimilation low environmental ammonia levels. rapid regulation ATP-requiring GS activity may ecological importance strictly anaerobic ruminal bacterium.
