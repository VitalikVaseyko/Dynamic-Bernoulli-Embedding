 transcriptional regulator GntR1 downregulates genes gluconate catabolism pentose phosphate pathway Corynebacterium glutamicum. Gluconate lowers DNA binding affinity GntR1, probably mechanism gluconate-dependent induction genes. addition, GntR1 positively regulates ptsG, gene encoding major glucose transporter, pck, gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Here, searched new target GntR1 genome-wide scale chromatin immunoprecipitation conjunction microarray (ChIP-chip) analysis. analysis identified 56 vivo GntR1 binding sites, 7 sites previously reported. newly identified GntR1 sites include upstream regions carbon metabolism genes pyk, maeB, gapB, icd, encoding pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase B, isocitrate dehydrogenase, respectively. Binding GntR1 promoter region genes confirmed electrophoretic mobility shift assay. activity icd, gapB, maeB promoters reduced mutation GntR1 binding site, contrast pyk promoter activity, increased, indicating GntR1 transcriptional activator icd, gapB, maeB repressor pyk. Thus, likely GntR1 stimulates glucose uptake inducing phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) gene repressing pyk increase PEP availability absence gluconate. Repression zwf gnd may reduce NADPH supply, may compensated induction maeB icd. Upregulation icd, gapB, maeB downregulation pyk GntR1 probably support gluconeogenesis.
