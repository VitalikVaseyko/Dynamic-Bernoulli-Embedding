 Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) recognized important indicator overall glycemic state preceding onset metabolic diseases. far, indentified genome-wide association loci FPG derived populations European ancestry, exceptions. extend thorough catalog FPG loci, conducted meta-analyses 13 genome-wide association studies 24,740 nondiabetic subjects East Asian ancestry. Follow-up replication analyses additional 21,345 participants identified three new FPG loci reaching genome-wide significance near PDK1-RAPGEF4, KANK1, IGF1R. results could provide additional insight genetic variation implicated fasting glucose regulation.
