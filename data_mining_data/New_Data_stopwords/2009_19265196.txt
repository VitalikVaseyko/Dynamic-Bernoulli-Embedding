 study, attempted understand mechanism regulation activity allosteric behavior pyruvate kinase M(2) enzyme two missense mutations, H391Y K422R, found cells Bloom syndrome patients, prone develop cancer. Results show despite presence mutations intersubunit contact domain, K422R H391Y mutant proteins maintained homotetrameric structure, similar wild-type protein, showed loss activity 75 20%, respectively. Interestingly, H391Y showed 6-fold increase affinity substrate phosphoenolpyruvate behaved like non-allosteric protein compromised cooperative binding. However, affinity phosphoenolpyruvate lost significantly K422R. Unlike K422R, H391Y showed enhanced thermal stability, stability range pH values, lesser effect allosteric inhibitor Phe, resistance toward structural alteration upon binding activator (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) inhibitor (Phe). mutants showed slight shift pH optimum 7.4 7.0. Although study signifies importance conserved amino acid residues long-range communications subunits multimeric proteins, altered behavior mutants suggestive probable role tumor-promoting growth metabolism Bloom syndrome patients defective pyruvate kinase M(2).
