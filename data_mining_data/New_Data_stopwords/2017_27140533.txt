 BACKGROUND: Increased maternal body mass index (BMI) robust risk factor later pediatric obesity. Accumulating evidence suggests human milk (HM) may attenuate transfer obesity mother offspring, potentially effects early development infant microbiome. OBJECTIVES: objective identify early differences intestinal microbiota cohort breastfeeding infants born obese compared normal-weight (NW) mothers. also investigated relations HM hormones (leptin insulin) taxonomic functional potentials infant microbiome. DESIGN: Clinical data infant stool fasting HM samples collected 18 NW [prepregnancy BMI (in kg/m(2)) <24.0] 12 obese (prepregnancy BMI >30.0) mothers exclusively breastfed infants 2 wk postpartum. Infant body composition 2 wk determined air-displacement plethysmography. Infant gastrointestinal microbes estimated using 16S amplicon whole-genome sequencing. HM insulin leptin determined ELISA; short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) measured stool samples using gas chromatography. Power set 80%. RESULTS: Infants born obese mothers exposed 2-fold higher HM insulin leptin concentrations (P < 0.01) showed significant reduction early pioneering bacteria Gammaproteobacteria (P = 0.03) exhibited trend elevated total SCFA content (P < 0.06). Independent maternal prepregnancy BMI, HM insulin positively associated microbial taxonomic diversity (P = 0.03) Gammaproteobacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae; P = 0.04) negatively associated Lactobacillales (e.g., Streptococcaceae; P = 0.05). Metagenomic analysis showed HM leptin insulin associated decreased bacterial proteases, implicated intestinal permeability, reduced concentrations pyruvate kinase, biomarker pediatric gastrointestinal inflammation. CONCLUSION: results indicate that, although maternal obesity may adversely affect early infant intestinal microbiome, HM insulin leptin independently associated beneficial microbial metabolic pathways predicted increase intestinal barrier function reduce intestinal inflammation. trial registered clinicaltrials.gov NCT01693406.
