 Proteomics screening methods identification diagnostic prognostic biomarkers cancer still lagging behind DNA- RNA-based analysis. used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combination laser capture microdissection (LCM) MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry determine differentially abundant proteins candidate biomarkers prostate cancer. Paired (benign tumor) samples isolated 23 Gleason Score 6 (GS 6) 23 Gleason Score 8 higher (GS 8+) radical prostatectomy specimens subjected 2D-DIGE analysis. Minimal fluorescent dye labeling applied electrophoresis performed triple samples (paired benign tumor; internal control) case tumor. Nineteen differently abundant proteins identified mass spectrometry validated. One half associated glycolysis Warburg effect; upregulated tumors. upregulation correlated tumor dedifferentiation might relevant selection therapeutic strategies. Among proteins, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) significantly upregulated tumor tissue compared benign counterpart. Furthermore, lamin statistically highly discriminatory low high Gleason score tumors might serve new biomarker tumor differentiation prognosis.
