 Glucocorticoid therapy often associated impaired insulin sensitivity cardiovascular disease. present study designed evaluate cardiac fatty acid (FA) composition metabolism following acute dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. Using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, rats injected Dex demonstrated reduced glucose infusion rate. whole body insulin resistance also associated heart-specific increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene expression reduction rate glucose oxidation. Dex treatment increased basal postheparin plasma lipolytic activity. heart, palmitic oleic acid levels higher 4 h Dex decreased control (CON) levels within 8 h. Measurement polyunsaturated FAs demonstrated drop linoleic gamma-linolenic acid, increase arachidonic acid (AA) acute Dex injection. Tissue FA either oxidized stored triglyceride (TG). 4 h, Dex augmented cardiac TG accumulation. However, increase tissue TG could maintained, 8 h following Dex, TG declined CON levels. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation known promote FA oxidation control acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Acute Dex promoted ACC phosphorylation, increased cardiac palmitate oxidation, likely effects increasing AMPK phosphorylation total AMPK protein gene expression. Whether acute effects Dex FA oxidation, TG storage, arachidonic acid accumulation translated increased cardiovascular risk following chronic therapy yet determined.
