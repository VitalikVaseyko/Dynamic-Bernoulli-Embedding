 BACKGROUND/AIMS: study addresses possibility difficult differential diagnosis pancreatic cancer chronic pancreatitis, especially cases pancreatic cancer appears course chronic pancreatitis. combination graphical methods pancreatic biopsy targeted endosonography seems precise diagnostic technique. Even negative findings procedure cannot exclude risk existing tumor additionally invasive technique. Therefore different conditions fulfilled allow use endoscopic bioptic instruments (biopsy biopsy needle). Tumor markers blood serum used practice, use seems limited sensitivity, level 60-70% average. METHODOLOGY: authors examined M2-pyruvate-kinase concentration group, included patients chronic pancreatitis, different grading pancreatic cancer well patients pancreatic cancer appeared course chronic pancreatitis. M2-pyruvate-kinase used marker tumor hyperplasia present higher concentration tumors gastrointestinal tract. RESULTS: authors observed important growth advanced forms pancreatic tumor compared patients chronic pancreatitis. M2-PK increased similar way patients pancreatic cancer course chronic pancreatitis. results led conclusion evaluation M2-PK concentration helps differentiating pancreatic cancer chronic pancreatitis, especially cases morphological changes gland focal character imitating pancreatic cancer.
