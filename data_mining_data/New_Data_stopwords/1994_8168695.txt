 Transgenic mice expressing P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)/human insulin chimeric gene obtained model study feasibility gene therapy diabetes. transgenic animals healthy normoglycemic expressed human insulin physiologically regulated manner, mainly liver. Streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice high levels human insulin immunoreactivity serum showed significant decrease (up 40%) glycemia compared streptozotocin-treated control mice. expression genes involved liver glucose metabolism, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, PEPCK, markedly altered diabetes, significantly recovered transgenic mice treated streptozotocin. addition, activity glucokinase glycogen synthase, content glucose 6-phosphate glycogen, normal liver, even transgenic animals treated diabetogenic doses streptozotocin. results constitute indication vivo diabetes gene therapy possible, means production insulin extrapancreatic tissues.
