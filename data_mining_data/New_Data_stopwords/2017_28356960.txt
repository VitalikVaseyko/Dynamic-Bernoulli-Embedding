 Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) previously identified tumor biomarker potential target cancer therapy. study, F section signFJ-5, characterized naphthoquinone modifier mollugin, synthesized order investigate anticancer activity potential mechanisms. observed FFJ-5 inhibited cell growth human lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 human hepatoma cells HepG2 MTT assays. FFJ-5 arrested cell cycle G2/M phase. analyses demonstrated FFJ-5 attenuated expression PKM2 reduced production adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Reduced expression activity epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Akt observed A549 HepG2 cells exposed FFJ-5. FFJ-5 exposure also resulted cell apoptosis, association decreased intracellular pH level mitochondrial membrane potential. addition, FFJ-5 activated caspase-3 cascade. conclusion, FFJ-5 inhibited cancer cell growth via blocking EGFR-Akt-PKM2 pathway synergistic action EGFR, Akt PKM2 proteins, alongside decrease ATP production. addition, FFJ-5 induced cancer cell apoptosis decreasing intracellular pH level mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. present results suggest potential role FFJ-5 therapy human cancer.
