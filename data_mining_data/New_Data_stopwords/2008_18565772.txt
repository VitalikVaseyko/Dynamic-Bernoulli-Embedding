 Molecular properties pyruvate kinase (PYK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) Streptococcus bovis transcriptional control two enzymes examined. Sequence analysis indicated PYK gene (pyk) clusters PFK gene (pfk) several genes. demonstrated pyk pfk cotranscribed transcription appeared regulated transcriptional level response sugars supplied. intracellular pyk-mRNA level lower catabolite control protein (CcpA)-disrupted mutant parent strain, binding site CcpA found upstream region pfk. results suggest pfk-pyk transcription enhanced CcpA. recombinant pyk-overexpressing strain showed approximately five-fold higher PYK activity, affect growth rate formate-to-lactate ratio significantly, suggesting flux glycolytic pathway altered increase PYK activity.
