 Deregulated c-Myc occurs approximately 30% human cancers. Similarly, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) commonly overexpressed variety human malignancies. physiologic conditions, HIF inhibits c-Myc activity; however, deregulated oncogenic c-Myc collaborates HIF inducing expression VEGF, PDK1 hexokinase 2. knowledge HIF derives studies investigating role HIF hypoxic conditions, however, HIF-1alpha stabilization also found normoxic conditions. Specifically, hypoxic conditions HIF-1-mediated regulation oncogenic c-Myc plays pivotal role conferring metabolic advantages tumor cells well adaptation tumorigenic micromilieu. addition, results show normoxic conditions oncogenic c-Myc required constitutive high HIF-1 protein levels activity Multiple Myeloma (MM) cells, thereby influencing VEGF secretion angiogenic activity within bone marrow microenvironment. studies needed delineate functional relevance HIF, MYC, HIF-MYC collaboration MM malignancies, also integrating tumor microenvironment cellular context. Importantly, early studies already demonstrate promising preclinical novel agents, predominantly small molecules, target c-Myc, HIF both.
