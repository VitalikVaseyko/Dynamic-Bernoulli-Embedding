 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) known play important role tumorigenesis tumor progression breast cancer. However, association PKM2 VEGF-C breast cancer remains unclear. present study, total 218 specimens breast cancer patients 26 paired breast tumors adjacent normal tissues well two breast cancer cell lines enrolled investigate correlation PKM2 VEGF-C. found PKM2 VEGF-C mRNA levels significantly increasing breast tumors compared adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown PKM2 mRNA expression resulted VEGF-C mRNA protein down-regulated well cell proliferation inhibited. positive correlation PKM2 VEGF-C expression identified immunohistochemical analyses 218 specimens patients breast cancer (P=0.023). PKM2 high expression significantly correlated histological grade (P=0.030), lymph node stage (P=0.001), besides VEGF-C high expression significantly associated lymphovascular invasion (P=0.012). combined high expression PKM2 VEGF-C found associated worse histological grade, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, shorter progression free survival (PFS), poorer overall survival (OS) human breast cancer. results present study suggested PKM2 expression correlated VEGF-C expression, combination PKM2 VEGF-C levels better prognostic significance predicting poor outcome patients breast cancer.
