 Rapidly proliferating neoplastically transformed cells generate energy required support rapid cell division increasing glycolysis decreasing flux oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, usually without alterations mitochondrial function. contrast, little known metabolic alterations, any, occur cells harboring mutations prime neoplastic transformation. address question, used Pten-deficient mouse model examine thyroid cells mild hyperplasia progresses slowly follicular thyroid carcinoma. Using model, report constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation caused PTEN deficiency nontransformed thyrocytes results global downregulation Krebs cycle OXPHOS gene expression, defective mitochondria, reduced respiration, enhancement compensatory glycolysis. found process involve pathways classically associated Warburg effect. Moreover, process independent proliferation contributed directly thyroid hyperplasia. findings define novel metabolic switch glycolysis driven PI3K-dependent AMPK inactivation consequent repression expression key metabolic transcription regulators.
