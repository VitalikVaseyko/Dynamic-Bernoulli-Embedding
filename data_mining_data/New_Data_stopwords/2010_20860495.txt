 generation energy, cancer cells utilize glycolysis vigorously oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria (Warburg effect). examined energy metabolism four leukemia cell lines using glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) inhibitor oxidative phosphorylation, oligomycin. NB4 relatively sensitive 2-DG (IC(50): 5.75 mM), consumed glucose produced lactate (waste product glycolysis) three cell lines. Consequently, NB4 considered "glycolytic" leukemia cell line. Dependency glycolysis NB4 confirmed fact glucose (+) FCS (-) medium showed growth survival glucose (-) FCS (+) medium. Alternatively, THP-1, resistant 2-DG (IC(50): 16.14 mM), sensitive oligomycin. Thus, THP-1 recognized dependent oxidative phosphorylation. THP-1, glucose (-) FCS (+) medium showed growth survival glucose (+) FCS (-) medium. dependency THP-1 FCS explained, least partly, fatty acid oxidation inhibitor fatty acid beta-oxidation, etomoxir, augmented growth suppression THP-1 2-DG. also examined mechanisms THP-1 resistant to, NB4 sensitive 2-DG treatment. THP-1, AMP kinase (AMPK), activated ATP becomes limiting, rapidly phosphorylated 2-DG, expression Bcl-2 augmented, might result resistance 2-DG. hand, AMPK phosphorylation augmentation Bcl-2 expression 2-DG observed NB4, 2-DG sensitive. results facilitate future leukemia therapy targeting metabolic pathways.
