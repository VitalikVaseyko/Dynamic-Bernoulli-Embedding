 dramatic escape response scallops modified reproductive investment acclimation temperature. Despite considerable knowledge physiology escape response, functional links escape response performance, organismal rates oxygen uptake, tissue metabolic capacities little known. measured oxygen consumption rates (standard, maximal, aerobic scope), escape behavior (initial repeat performance), tissue mass, condition index, protein content, tissue metabolic capacities Iceland scallop Chlamys islandica examine links parameters. Postexercise oxygen consumption rates positively linked contraction rate (repeat test) pyruvate kinase activity adductor muscle negatively linked digestive gland wet mass. Swimming behavior mainly related activity glycolytic enzymes, enzymatic activities related anatomic parameters. Scallop behavior physiology change size, within samples larger scale. Small scallops showed intense swimming activity higher arginine kinase activities lower glycolytic enzyme activities adductor muscle larger scallops. corresponds ontogenetic change susceptibility predation habitat use observed C. islandica.
