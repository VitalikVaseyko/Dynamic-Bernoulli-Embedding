 use antipsychotics carries risk metabolic side effects, weight gain new onset type-2 diabetes mellitus. mechanisms observed metabolic alterations fully understood. compared effects two atypical antipsychotics, one known favor weight gain (olanzapine), (aripiprazole), glucose metabolism. Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated stimulated olanzapine aripiprazole 72 h. Cellular glucose uptake analyzed vitro 18F-FDG uptake. measurements comprised mRNA expression glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 3, GLUT1 protein expression, DNA methylation GLUT1 promoter region, proteins involved downstream glucometabolic processes. observed 2-fold increase glucose uptake stimulation aripiprazole. contrast, olanzapine stimulation decreased glucose uptake 40%, accompanied downregulation cellular energy sensor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). GLUT1 protein expression increased, GLUT1 mRNA expression decreased, GLUT1 promoter hypermethylated antipsychotics. Pyruvat-dehydrogenase (PDH) complex activity decreased olanzapine only. findings suggest atypical antipsychotics olanzapine aripiprazole differentially affect energy metabolism PBMC. observed decrease glucose uptake olanzapine stimulated PBMC, accompanied decreased PDH point worsening cellular energy metabolism compensated AMKP upregulation. contrast, aripiprazole stimulation lead increased glucose uptake, affecting PDH complex expression. observed differences may involved different metabolic profiles observed aripiprazole olanzapine treated patients.
