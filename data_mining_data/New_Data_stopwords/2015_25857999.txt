 Chronic ethanol consumption shown significantly decrease hepatic glycogen content; however, mechanisms responsible adverse metabolic effect unknown. study, examined impact chronic ethanol consumption time-of-day-dependent oscillations (rhythms) glycogen metabolism processes liver. this, male C57BL/6J mice fed either control ethanol-containing liquid diet 5 wk, livers collected every 4 h 24 h analyzed changes various genes proteins involved hepatic glycogen metabolism. Glycogen displayed robust diurnal rhythm livers mice fed control diet, peak occurring active (dark) period day. diurnal glycogen rhythm significantly altered livers ethanol-fed mice, glycogen peak shifted inactive (light) period overall content glycogen decreased compared controls. Chronic ethanol consumption disrupted diurnal rhythms gene expression (glycogen synthase 1 2, glycogenin, glucokinase, protein targeting glycogen, pyruvate kinase), total phosphorylated glycogen synthase protein, enzyme activities glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase, rate-limiting enzymes glycogen metabolism. summary, results show first time chronic ethanol consumption disrupts diurnal rhythms hepatic glycogen metabolism gene protein level. Chronic ethanol-induced disruption daily rhythms likely contributes glycogen depletion disruption hepatic energy homeostasis, recognized risk factor etiology alcoholic liver disease.
