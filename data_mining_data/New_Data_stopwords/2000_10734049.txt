 Pyruvate kinase M(1), nonallosteric isozyme, lacks heterotropic allosteric effect involving fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). explore molecular basis this, series mutants prepared characterized, possible candidate, Glu-432, replaced rat M(1) isozyme allosteric mutant replacement Ala-398 Arg. Although single mutants Glu-432 remained nearly fully active, similar wild type, mutants replacements Lys Ala efficiently activated FBP enzymes inhibited L-phenylalanine. Kinetic analyses ligand-induced fluorescence quenching studies using allosteric double mutants indicated loss negative charge residue 432 led dramatic decrease apparent activation constant apparent K(d) FBP. Furthermore, enhancement found associated modification FBP-binding site rather alteration subunit assembly. findings suggest Glu-432 hinders heterotropic allosteric effect preventing binding FBP repulsive electrostatic interaction thereby contributes unique unregulated properties, independent shifted allosteric transition.
