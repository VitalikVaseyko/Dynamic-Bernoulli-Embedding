 Oxidative stress known severely impede aerobic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. However, metabolically-versatile Pseudomonas fluorescens survives challenge invoking alternative ATP-generating networks. grown medium glutamine sole organic nutrient presence H2O2, microbe utilizes glutamine synthetase (GS) modulate energy budget. activity enzyme mediates release energy stored glutamine sharply increased stressed cells compared controls. enhanced activities enzymes acetate kinase, adenylate kinase nucleotide diphosphate kinase ensured efficacy ATP producing-machine transferring high energy phosphate. elevated amounts phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase recorded H2O2 exposed cells provided another route ATP independent reduction O2. first demonstration metabolic pathway involving GS dedicated ATP synthesis. phospho-transfer network pivotal survival microorganism oxidative stress may reveal therapeutic targets infectious microbes reliant glutamine proliferation.
