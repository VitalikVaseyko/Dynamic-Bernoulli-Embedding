 Besides significantly broadening scope available data adhesion proteins solid substrates, demonstrate first time seven proteins (tested here) behave similarly respect adhesion exhibiting step increase adhesion wettability solid substrate decreases. Also, quantitative measures like-protein-protein like-self-assembled-monolayer (SAM)-SAM adhesive energies provided. New correlations, previously reported, suggest helix random content (as measures secondary structure) normalized molecular weight protein significant predicting protein adhesion likely related protein stability interfaces. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) used directly measure normalized adhesion pull-off forces set seven globular proteins series eight well-defined model surfaces (SAMs), like-SAM-immobilized surfaces like-protein-immobilized surfaces phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). Normalized force-distance curves SAMs (alkanethiolates deposited gold terminated functional uncharged groups -CH3, -OPh, -CF3, -CN, -OCH3, -OH, -CONH2, -EG3OH) covalently attached AFM cantilever tip modified sphere covalently immobilized proteins (ribonuclease A, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulin, gamma-globulins, pyruvate kinase, fibrinogen) clearly illustrate differences adhesion surfaces proteins. adhesion proteins uncharged SAMs showed general "step" dependence wettability surface determined water contact angle cyclooctane (thetaco). Thus, SAMs thetaco < approximately 66 degrees, (-OH, -CONH2, -EG3OH), weak adhesion observed (>-4 +/- 1 mN/m), approximately 66 < thetaco < approximately 104 degrees, (-CH3, -OPh, -CF3, -CN, -OCH3), strong adhesion observed (< =8 +/- 3 mN/m) increases (more negative) molecular weight protein. Large proteins (170-340 kDa), contrast small proteins (14 kDa), exhibit characteristic stepwise decompression curves extending large separation distances (hundreds nanometers). respect like-SAM surfaces, exists strong adhesive (attractive) interaction apolar SAM surfaces weak interactive energy polar SAM surfaces. polar surfaces form hydrogen bonds water molecules apolar surfaces cannot, measurements provide quantitative measure so-called mean hydrophobic interaction (approximately -206 +/- 8 mN/m) phosphate-buffered saline 296 +/- 1 K. Regarding protein-protein interactions, small globular proteins (lysozyme ribonuclease A) least self-adhesion force, indicating robust conformation proteins surface. Intermediate large proteins (BSA pyruvate kinase-tetramer) show measurable adhesion suggest unfolding (mechanical denaturation) retraction protein-covered substrate protein-covered AFM tip. Fibrinogen shows greatest adhesion 20.4 +/- 2 mN/m. Unexpectedly, immunoglobulin G (IgG) gamma-globulins exhibited little adhesion intermediate size proteins. However, using new composite index, n (the product percent helix plus random content times relative molecular weight fraction largest protein set, Fib), correlate normalized adhesion force, IgG gamma-globulins behave abnormally result relatively low helix random (or high sheet) content.
