 study investigated effects constant cyclic heat stress muscle metabolism meat quality broiler breast fillet thigh meat 4 6 wk age. Male Arbor Acres (AA) broilers (n = 270, 4 wk old) raised different temperature conditions: standard (temperature 23 degrees C); constant high temperature (temperature 34 degrees C); cyclic high temperature (temperature 36 degrees C 1000 h 1600 h 23 degrees C 1600 h 1000 h). 42, broilers stunned sampled. results showed chronic high temperature significantly decreased proportion breast muscle significantly increased proportion thigh muscle (P < 0.05). moisture concentration significantly higher breast muscle birds exposed constant high temperature (P < 0.05), whereas protein content significantly lower (P < 0.05) fat deposition significantly higher (P < 0.05) breast muscle birds exposed constant diurnal cyclic high temperature grown standard temperature. breast thigh muscle birds grown constant high temperature significantly higher lightness, cook loss, shear force (P < 0.05) significantly lower initial pH (pH(i)), ultimate pH (pH(u)), redness compared grown standard temperature (P < 0.05). pH(i), pH(u), redness significantly lower (P < 0.05) lightness shear force significantly higher breast muscle chickens raised diurnal cyclic high temperature (P < 0.05) grown standard temperature. contrast, lightness yellowness thigh muscle significantly higher (P < 0.05) chickens grown diurnal cyclic high temperature standard temperature. Breast thigh muscle broilers exposed constant high temperature produced higher (P < 0.05) lactic acid pyruvate kinase activities exposed standard temperature. results indicated chronic heat stress significantly increased lactate production, reduced meat pH value accelerating meat glycolysis, eventually reduced meat quality.
