 Aerobic glycolysis, metabolic hallmark cancer, associated radioresistance non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), key regulator glycolysis, expressed exclusively cancers. However, impact PKM2 silencing radiosensitivity NSCLC explored. Here, show plasmid shRNA-PKM2 expressing short hairpin RNA targeting PKM2 (pshRNA-PKM2) demonstrate treatment pshRNA-PKM2 effectively inhibits PKM2 expression NSCLC cell lines xenografts. Silencing PKM2 expression enhanced ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis autophagy vitro vivo, accompanied inhibiting AKT PDK1 phosphorylation, enhanced ERK GSK3beta phosphorylation. results demonstrated knockdown PKM2 expression enhances radiosensitivity NSCLC cell lines xenografts well may aid design new therapies treatment NSCLC.
