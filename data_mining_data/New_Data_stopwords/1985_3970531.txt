 Rat brain pyruvate kinase purified near homogeneity three-step process involving ammonium sulfate precipitation phosphocellulose Blue-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. enzyme migrated polyacrylamide gel along commercial sample rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. enzyme showed hyperbolic relationship phosphoenolpyruvate ADP, apparent Km's 0.18 0.42 X 10(-3) M, respectively. enzyme inhibited ATP, effect pronounced unsaturating concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate. L-Phenylalanine found strong inhibitor enzyme, Ki inhibitor 0.11 mM. inhibition phenylalanine pronounced pH 7.4 pH 7.0, appeared competitive phosphoenolpyruvate. L-Alanine fructose 1,6-bisphosphate prevented inhibition enzyme phenylalanine. Ca2+ found strong inhibitor enzyme, inhibition marked saturating phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations. kinetic properties purified brain pyruvate kinase suggest enzyme may distinct muscle liver enzymes.
