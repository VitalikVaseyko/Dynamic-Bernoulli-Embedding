 present work methods localization glucose-6-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate residues tissue sections means labeled colloidal gold specific enzymes (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase) described. order get sufficient amount labeled enzyme protein salts, used stabilize colloidal gold salts, albumin added. Residues glucose-6-phosphoenolpyruvate scattered equally villi human placenta. rat liver centrolobular localized hepatocytes high content specific staining. lot glucose-6-phosphate residues hepatocytes nuclei.
