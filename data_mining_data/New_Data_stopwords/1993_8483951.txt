 intron sequences human L-type pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR) determined using primers selected known cDNA sequence. Oligonucleotide primers determined intron sequences used sequence exons. technique applied DNA 10 unrelated patients pyruvate kinase deficiency, following eight different mutations coding region detected: del391-393, A401, C464, G721, A1076, T1456, T1484, A1529. A1529 mutation found repeatedly unrelated individuals, even homozygous state. context respect polymorphism nt 1705 compatible single origin mutation, may represent balanced polymorphism. normal subjects, five differences published cDNA sequence documented.
