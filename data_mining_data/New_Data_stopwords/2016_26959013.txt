 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) key enzymes glucose metabolism, negatively regulating pyruvate dehyrogenase complex (PDC) activity phosphorylation. Inhibiting PDKs could upregulate PDC activity drive cells aerobic metabolism. Therefore, PDKs potential targets metabolism related diseases, cancers diabetes. study, series computer-aided virtual screening techniques utilized discover potential inhibitors PDKs. Structure-based screening using Libdock carried following ADME (adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) toxicity prediction. Molecular docking used analyze binding mechanism compounds PDKs. Molecular dynamic simulation utilized confirm stability potential compound binding. computational results, two novel natural coumarins compounds (ZINC12296427 ZINC12389251) ZINC database found binding PDKs favorable interaction energy predicted non-toxic. study provide valuable information PDK-coumarins binding mechanisms PDK inhibitor-based drug discovery.
