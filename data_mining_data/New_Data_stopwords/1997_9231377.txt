 Associations glycolytic enzymes subcellular particulate fraction skeletal muscle heart examined entrance daily torpor deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). skeletal muscle significant decrease enzyme binding occurred torpor entrance phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, additional significant decrease phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase deepest state torpor. Reductions enzyme binding torpor entrance also occurred heart; significant changes observed hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase binding. Contrary finding additional reductions enzyme binding seen skeletal muscle, significant increases enzyme binding deepest torpor state observed hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase heart. results suggest decrease binding glycolytic enzymes subcellular structures skeletal muscle heart may least partially responsible initiating reduction metabolic rate torpor entrance. decreased binding may continue mediate metabolic reduction skeletal muscle throughout torpor; heart, however, may require use different molecular mechanisms. increased binding heart deepest state torpor may represent anticipatory response preparation increased activity arousal.
