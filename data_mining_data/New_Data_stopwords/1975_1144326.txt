 study made effect food high glucose content given albino rats long time blood sugar insulin. Changes activity hexokinase pyruvickinase liver also investigated. Food high glucose content given rats 90--100 days led increase blood sugar insulin level. activity hexokinase pyruvickinase rose markedly 40th--60th day feeding, fell initial level 80th--90th day. Thus, case prolonged action insulin organism result prolonged stimulation insular apparatus pancreas glucose developed signs peculiar insulin-resistance.
