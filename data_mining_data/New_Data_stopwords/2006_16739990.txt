 Metabolically engineered Escherichia coli previously used degrade cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE). strains express six genes evolved toluene ortho-monooxygenase Burkholderia cepacia G4 (TOM-Green, formed reactive epoxide) either (1) gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GSHI, forms glutathione) glutathione S-transferase IsoILR1 Rhodococcus AD45 (which adds glutathione reactive cis-DCE epoxide) (2) evolved epoxide hydrolase Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (EchA F108L/I219L/C248I converts reactive cis-DCE epoxide diol). Here, impact metabolic engineering bioremediation assessed investigating changes proteome quantitative shotgun proteomics technique (iTRAQ) tracking changes due sequential addition TOM-Green, IsoILR1, GSHI due adding evolved EchA versus wild-type enzyme TOM-Green. TOM-Green/EchA system, 8 proteins 268 identified proteins differentially expressed strain expressing EchA F108L/I219L/C248I relative wild-type EchA (e.g., EchA, protein chain elongation factor EF-Ts, 50S ribosomal subunits L7/L12/L32/L29, cysteine synthase A, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, iron superoxide dismutase). TOM-Green/IsoILR1/GSHI system, expression level 49 proteins changed 364 identified proteins. induced proteins due addition TOM-Green, IsoILR1, GSHI involved oxidative defense mechanism, pyruvate metabolism, glutathione synthesis (e.g., 30S ribosomal subunit proteins S3 S16, 50S ribosomal subunit protein L20, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, lactate dehydrogenase, acetate kinase, cysteine synthase A). Enzymes involved indole synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle repressed (e.g., tryptophanase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase). Hence, metabolic engineering leads enhanced aerobic degradation 1 mM cis-DCE (2.4-4-fold chloride ions released) reduced toxicity cis-DCE epoxide results enhanced synthesis glutathione coupled induced stress response well repression fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
