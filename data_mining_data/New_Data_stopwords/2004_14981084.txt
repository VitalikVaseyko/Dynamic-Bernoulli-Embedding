 Mammals express nine membranous adenylyl cyclase isoforms (ACs 1-9), structurally related soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) soluble AC (sAC). Moreover, Bacillus anthracis Bacillus pertussis produce AC toxins, edema factor (EF), adenylyl cyclase toxin (ACT), respectively. 2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate potent competitive inhibitor AC S49 lymphoma cell membranes. data prompted us study systematically effects 24 nucleotides AC S49 Sf9 insect cell membranes, ACs 1, 2, 5, 6, expressed Sf9 membranes purified catalytic subunits membranous ACs (C1 AC5 C2 AC2), sAC, sGC, EF, ACT presence MnCl(2). N-Methylanthraniloyl (MANT)-GTP inhibited C1.C2 K(i) 4.2 nm. Phe-889 Ile-940 C2 mediate hydrophobic interactions MANT group. MANT-inosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate potently inhibited C1.C2 ACs 1, 5, 6 exhibited low affinity sGC, EF, ACT, G-proteins. Inosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate uridine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate mixed G-protein activators AC inhibitors. AC5 15-fold sensitive inhibitors AC2. EF ACT exhibited unique inhibitor profiles. sAC, 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine 3'-triphosphate potent compound (IC(50), 690 nm). Several MANT-adenine MANT-guanine nucleotides inhibited sGC K(i) values 200-400 nm range. UTP ATP exhibited similar affinities sGC GTP mixed sGC substrates inhibitors. exchange MnCl(2) MgCl(2) reduced inhibitor potencies ACs sGC 1.5-250-fold, depending nucleotide cyclase studied. omission NTP-regenerating system cyclase reactions strongly reduced potencies MANT-ADP, indicative phosphorylation MANT-ATP pyruvate kinase. Collectively, AC isoforms sGC differentially inhibited purine pyrimidine nucleotides.
