 Genetically obese (ob/ob) mice display variety metabolic differences lean litter mates. obese state, fatty acid desaturation-elongation brown adipose tissue mitochondria apparently altered, resulting differences membrane fatty acid composition. change membrane lipid environment appears influence GDP binding therefore activity proton conductance pathway associated regulation energy expenditure animals. liver, binding insulin nuclear membrane increased feeding high polyunsaturated/saturated (P/S) diet fat. Consumption high P/S diet decreased mRNA levels fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, malic enzyme, pyruvate kinase obese lean animals. Expression mRNA lipogenic enzymes higher obese animals suggests obese mice may resistant polyunsaturated fatty acid feedback control gene expression.
