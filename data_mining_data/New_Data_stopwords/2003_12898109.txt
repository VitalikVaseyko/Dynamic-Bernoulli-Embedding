 use beads bearing bioactive molecules develop generic biochips based chemi- electro-chemiluminescent detection evaluated. biochips composed arrayed biosensors, including enzyme-charged beads, antigen-charged beads, oligonucleotide-charged beads, entrapped poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA-SbQ) photopolymer. case sensing layers spotted surface glassy carbon electrode 0.3 microL drops, generating 500-800 microm spots. luminescent reactions either catalysed horseradish peroxidase triggered application +850 mV potential glassy carbon electrode platinum pseudo-reference. Enzyme biochips designed concomitant detection choline, glucose, glutamate, lactate, lysine, urate, based corresponding oxidase-charged beads electro-chemiluminescent (ECL) reaction luminol-immobilised beads hydrogen peroxide produced. Limits detection 1 micromol L(-1) glutamate, lysine uric acid, 20 micromol L(-1) glucose, 2 micromol L(-1) choline lactate found detection ranging three decades least. Use electro-chemiluminescent biochip extended tri-enzymatic sensing layer based kinase-oxidase activity detection acetate. reaction sequence using acetate kinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate oxidase enabled production H2O2 response acetate injection range 10 micromol L(-1) 100 mmol L(-1). Based IgG-bearing beads, chemiluminescent immuno-biochip also realised model detection human IgG. Biotin-labelled anti-human IgG used competitive assay, conjunction peroxidase-labelled streptavidin. Free antigen could detected detection limit 25 pg (10(8) molecules) 15 ng. similar way, use oligonucleotide-immobilised beads enabled realisation DNA-sensitive biochips could used detect biotin-labelled sequence al level 5x10(8) molecules.
