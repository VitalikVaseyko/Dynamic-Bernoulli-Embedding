 activities rate-limiting enzymes glycolytic pathway measured various areas rat brains kept temperature +25 degrees C various intervals death cervical dislocation. Hexokinase shows substantial decline activity period 24 h, reaching 41%, 57%, 44%, 51% controls cerebellum, medulla oblongata pons, cerebral cortex, diencephalon, respectively. areas phosphofructokinase reached 28%, 61%, 60%, 40% zero-time activity, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase behaves differently four areas, increase cerebral cortex diencephalon decrease cerebellum medulla oblongata pons. Pyruvate kinase activity quite stable 24 h period studied. Therefore, activities hexokinase phosphofructokinase brain tissue little value diagnosis time death.
