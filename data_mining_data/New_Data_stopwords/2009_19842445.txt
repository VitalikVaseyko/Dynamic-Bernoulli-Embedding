 Conventional diagnosis hereditary red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders, particular hereditary spherocytosis (HS), labor intensive, time consuming requires least 2 ml blood, might impractical neonatal period. evaluated use eosin-5-maleimide (EMA), dye reacts covalently lysine-430 first extracellular loop band 3 protein, rapid screening test patients HS Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis (SAO). Fresh RBCs 142 healthy controls, 50 HS, 17 SAO, 29 hereditary elliptocytosis, 5 autoimmune hemolytic anemia, 66 patients beta-thalassemia/HbE, 31 cases alpha-thalassemia (HbH disease) 4 cases pyruvate kinase deficiency stained EMA, analyzed mean channel fluorescence (MCF) using flow cytometer. RBCs patients HS SAO expressed greater degree reduction MCF compared normal controls hemolytic diseases. findings showed fluorescence flow cytometric-based method simple, sensitive reliable diagnostic test RBC membrane disorders using small volume blood, results could obtained within 2 hours. method could serve first line screening diagnosis HS SAO routine hematology specific membrane protein electrophoresis molecular diagnosis employed.
