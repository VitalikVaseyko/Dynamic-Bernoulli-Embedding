 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) plays important role regulating carbohydrate oxidation skeletal muscle. PDH deactivated set PDH kinases (PDK1, PDK2, PDK3, PDK4), PDK2 PDK4 predominant isoforms skeletal muscle. Although PDK2 abundant isoform, studies examined physiological role. role PDK2 PDH activation (PDHa) rest muscle stimulation 10 40 Hz (eliciting low- moderate-intensity muscle contractions, respectively) isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles studied PDK2 knockout (PDK2KO) wild-type (WT) mice (n = 5 per group). PDHa activity unexpectedly 35 77% lower PDK2KO WT muscle (P = 0.043), total PDK activity nearly fourfold lower PDK2KO muscle (P = 0.006). 40-Hz contractions, initial force lower PDK2KO WT muscle (P < 0.001) fatigued similarly approximately 75% initial force 3 min. differences initial force rate fatigue 10-Hz contractions. PDK1 compensated lack PDK2 1.8-fold higher PDK2KO WT muscle (P = 0.019). likely contributed ensuring resting PDHa activity similar groups accounts lower PDH activation muscle contraction, PDK1 potent inhibitor PDH complex. Increased PDK1 expression appears regulated hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha, 3.5-fold higher PDK2KO muscle. clear PDK2 activity essential, even rest, regulation carbohydrate oxidation production reducing equivalents electron transport chain. addition, results underscore importance overall kinetics PDK isoform population, rather total PDK activity, determining transformation PDH complex PDHa activity muscle contraction.
