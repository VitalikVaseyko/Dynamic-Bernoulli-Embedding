 Cryptobia salmositica (pathogenic vaccine strains), Cryptobia bullocki (pathogenic), Cryptobia catostomi (nonpathogenic) similar oxygen consumption rates (0.17 +/- 0.01 nm O2/10(6) parasites). Incubation sodium azide (5 microliters 1-M solution 1 ml parasite suspension, i.e., 5-mM final concentration) reduced oxygen consumption approximately 4.5-fold. Motility parasites also greatly reduced sodium azide. oxygen consumption motility parasites returned preazide treatment levels azide removed even 24 hr incubation sodium azide. activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, cytochrome C oxidase detected 3 species Cryptobia.
