 characteristics vitro polyuridylic acid dependent amino acid incorporating system prepared germinating macroconidia Microsporum canis described. incorporation 14C-phenylalanine polyphenylalanine dependent S-30 extract, adenosine triphosphate, magnesium ions polyuridylic acid. Incorporation slightly enhanced yeast transfer ribonucleic acid pyruvate kinase. system highly sensitive ribonuclease, puromycin miconazole (an antifungal agent), moderately sensitive sodium fluoride much less sensitive phenethylalcohol, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol deoxyribonuclease. Cell-free extract ungerminated conidia less capacity synthesize protein germination marked increase protein synthetic activity observed. results experiments wherein ribosomes S-100 fraction germinated ungerminated spores unterchanged, revealed defect extract ungerminated spore ribosomes.
