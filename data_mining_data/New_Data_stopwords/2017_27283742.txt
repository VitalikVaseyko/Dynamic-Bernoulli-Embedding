 OBJECTIVE: Drug-eluting coronary stents reduce restenosis rate late lumen loss compared bare-metal stents; however, drug-eluting coronary stents may delay vascular healing increase late stent thrombosis. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARdelta) exhibits actions could favorably influence outcomes drug-eluting coronary stents placement. APPROACH RESULTS: Here, report PPARdelta ligand-coated stents strongly reduce development neointima luminal narrowing rabbit model experimental atherosclerosis. Inhibition inflammatory gene expression vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation migration, prevention thrombocyte activation aggregation, proproliferative effects endothelial cells identified key mechanisms prevention restenosis. Using normal PPARdelta-depleted VSMCs, show observed effects PPARdelta ligand GW0742 VSMCs thrombocytes PPARdelta receptor dependent. PPARdelta ligand treatment induces expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 downregulates glucose transporter 1 VSMCs, thus impairing ability VSMCs provide increased energy demands required growth factor-stimulated proliferation migration. CONCLUSIONS: contrast commonly used drugs stent coating, PPARdelta ligands inhibit inflammatory response proliferation VSMCs also prevent thrombocyte activation support vessel re-endothelialization. Thus, pharmacological PPARdelta activation could promising novel strategy improve drug-eluting coronary stents outcomes.
