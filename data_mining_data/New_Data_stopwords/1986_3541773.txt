 Transfusion young red blood cells (YRBC) prolonged survival result increased intervals transfusions and, therefore, decreased transfusion-associated iron loading. prospective clinical trial comparing YRBC transfusions prepared apheresis versus washed frozen red cell transfusions performed five children transfusion-dependent thalassemia. total 152 YRBC units, evaluated reticulocyte enrichment pyruvate kinase activity, transfused. slightly longer interval transfusions observed time period YRBC versus time period (30.0 +/- 1.5 days versus 27.9 +/- 1.1 days, respectively, p less 0.02), associated decrease mg iron transfused per kg. effectiveness transfused YRBC units less predicted vitro vivo studies.
