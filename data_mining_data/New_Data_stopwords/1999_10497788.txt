 genomic sequence data become prevalent, challenges microbial physiology shift identifying biochemical pathways understanding interactions occur create robust responsive metabolism. One powerful methods identify interactions vivo phenotypic analysis. utilized thiamine synthesis model detect subtle metabolic interactions due sensitivity allowed small cellular requirement vitamin. Although purine biosynthesis produces intermediate thiamine synthesis, mutants blocked first step de novo purine biosynthesis (PurF) able grow absence thiamine owing alternative synthesis. number general metabolic defects found prevent PurF-independent thiamine synthesis. report stimulation thiamine-independent growth caused mutation one genes encoding pyruvate kinase isozymes. results presented herein represent first phenotype described mutants defective pykA pykF, thus identify metabolic interactions exist vivo.
