 Previous studies laboratory shown mitochondrial bound hexokinase markedly elevated highly glycolytic hepatoma cells (Parry, D. M., Pedersen, P.L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10904-10912). pore-forming protein, porin, within outer membrane appears comprise least part receptor site (Nakashima, R.A., Mangan, P.S., Colombini, M., Pedersen, P.L. (1986). Biochemistry 25, 1015-1021). studies reported experiments carried assess functional significance mitochondrial bound tumor hexokinase. Two approaches used determine whether bound enzyme preferred access mitochondrially generated ATP relative cytosolic ATP. first approach compared time course glucose 6-phosphate formation AS-30D hepatoma mitochondria conditions ATP regenerated endogenously via oxidative phosphorylation exogenously added pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate. second approach involved measurement specific radioactivity glucose 6-phosphate formed following addition [gamma-32P]ATP either phosphorylating nonphosphorylating AS-30D mitochondria. approaches provided results show source ATP bound hexokinase derived preferentially ATP synthase residing within inner mitochondrial membrane compartment rather medium (i.e. cytosolic compartment). results provide first direct demonstration exceptionally high level hexokinase bound mitochondria highly glycolytic tumor cells preferred access mitochondrially generated ATP, finding may rather profound metabolic significance tumors.
