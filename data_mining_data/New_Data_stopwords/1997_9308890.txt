 structure rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase crystallized complex Mg2+, K+, L-phospholactate (L-P-lactate) solved refined 2.7 resolution. crystals, grown solutions polyethylene glycol 8000 pH 7.5, belong space group P2(1) unit cell parameters = 144.4 A, b = 112.6 A, c = 171.2 A, beta = 93.7 degrees. asymmetric unit contains two tetramers. crystal structure reveals eight subunits within asymmetric unit adopt several different conformations. conformations characterized differences relative positions protein domains B, resulting different degrees closure active site cleft occupies interface two domains. global conformational differences may described rotations B domain respect (beta/alpha)8-barrel domain. Carbon atoms backbone domain B rotate >20 degrees open closed subunit. different conformations among subunits within asymmetric unit accompanied 3-3.8 shifts position Mg2+ significant change orientation phenyl ring Phe 243. subunits, Mg2+ coordinates protein carboxylate side chains Glu 271 Asp 295. subunit closed conformation, Mg2+ also coordinates carboxylate oxygen, bridging ester oxygen, nonbridging phosphoryl oxygen L-P-lactate. Mg2+ L-P-lactate coordination missing subunits exhibiting open conformation. K+ coordinates four protein ligands phosphoryl oxygen L-P-lactate. position liganding K+ unaffected different conformations subunits. side chain Arg 72, Mg2+, K+ provides locus positive charge phosphate moiety analog closed subunit.
