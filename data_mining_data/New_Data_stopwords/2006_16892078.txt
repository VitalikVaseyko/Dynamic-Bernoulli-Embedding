 cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis use metabolic pathway generation ATP main source energy supply. phenomenon known Warburg effect considered one fundamental metabolic alterations malignant transformation. recent years, significant progresses understanding underlying mechanisms potential therapeutic implications. Biochemical molecular studies suggest several possible mechanisms metabolic alteration may evolve cancer development. mechanisms include mitochondrial defects malfunction, adaptation hypoxic tumor microenvironment, oncogenic signaling, abnormal expression metabolic enzymes. Importantly, increased dependence cancer cells glycolytic pathway ATP generation provides biochemical basis design therapeutic strategies preferentially kill cancer cells pharmacological inhibition glycolysis. Several small molecules emerged exhibit promising anticancer activity vitro vivo, single agent combination therapeutic modalities. glycolytic inhibitors particularly effective cancer cells mitochondrial defects hypoxic conditions, frequently associated cellular resistance conventional anticancer drugs radiation therapy. increased aerobic glycolysis commonly seen wide spectrum human cancers hypoxia present tumor microenvironment, development novel glycolytic inhibitors new class anticancer agents likely broad therapeutic applications.
