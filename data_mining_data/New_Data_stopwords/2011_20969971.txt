 (1)(4)C labeling experiments performed kernel cultures showed developing maize endosperm efficient non-photosynthetic tissues sunflower maize embryos converting maternally supplied substrates biomass. characterize metabolic fluxes endosperm, maize kernels labeled isotopic steady state using (1)(3)C-labeled glucose. resultant labeling free metabolites biomass analyzed NMR GC-MS. taking account labeling substrates supplied metabolically active cob, fluxes central metabolism quantified computer-aided modeling. flux map indicates 51-69% ATP produced used biomass synthesis 47% expended substrate cycling. findings point potential engineering targets improving yield increasing oil contents by, respectively, reducing substrate cycling increasing commitment plastidic carbon fatty acid synthesis level pyruvate kinase.
