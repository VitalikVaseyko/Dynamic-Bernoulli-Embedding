 metabolism motile fish sperm well understood, current study examined metabolism saline-activated zebrafish (Danio rerio) sperm. Activation sperm inhibitors oxidative phosphorylation (potassium cyanide, 2,4 dinitrophenol carbonyl cyanide 3-cholorophenylhydrazone) negatively impacted sperm motility 60-90 postactivation. Incubation quiescent sperm 2,4 dinitrophenol prior activation resulted 67% decrease percent motile sperm assessed 15s postactivation. Thus, production ATP quiescent sperm important motility upon activation nascent ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation motile sperm appears important 60-90 postactivation. Exposure sperm iodoacetamide, inhibitor creatine kinase, activation without effect. However, incubation quiescent sperm iodoacetamide prior activation resulted 77% reduction percent motile sperm decreased velocity wobble 15s postactivation. results suggest creatine kinase phosphocreatine shuttle physiologically important at, shortly initiation motility. Finally, sperm exposed lactate, pyruvate, acetate well several monosaccharides upon activation. results provided evidence supporting metabolic role exogenous organics (potentially female via ovarian fluid) sperm motility begun.
