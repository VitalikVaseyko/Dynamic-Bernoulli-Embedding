 OBJECTIVE: study aimed increasing glycolytic flux pyruvate productivity Torulopsis glabrata glucose carbon source. METHODS: target, introduced mitochondrial located alternative oxidase encoded Histoplasma capsulatum AOX1 gene T. glabrata, mutant strain named AOX total NADH oxidase activity 1.8-fold higher parent stain, achieved. RESULTS: heterologous expression NADH alternative oxidase resulted decrease dry cell weight fermentation time 20.3% 10.7%, specific rate glucose consumption pyruvate production increased 34.7% 54.1% higher, respectively. reasons high glycolytic flux intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio ATP concentration decreased 74.7% 52.9% respectively, specific activity phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase increased 185.0% 28.1%. CONCLUSION: Introduction novel NADH oxidation pathway alternative oxidase efficiently increase rate glucose consumption target metabolite productivity.
