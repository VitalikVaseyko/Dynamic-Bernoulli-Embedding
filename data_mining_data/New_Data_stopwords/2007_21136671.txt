 identify proteins associated esophageal carcinogenesis, performed protein profiling 16 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) paired noncancerous tissues 2-DE MS/MS. cancerous tissues, three spots showed significant up-regulation amount protein, eight spots significantly down-regulated. identities spots determined PMF LC-MS/MS confirmed immunoblotting. up-regulated proteins tropomyosin alpha 4 chain, transgelin, pyruvate kinase. down-regulated proteins serum albumin precursor, isoforms annexin A1, tropomyosin beta chain, 14-3-3 protein sigma, isoforms serotransferrin precursor. 16 cases, up-regulation tropomyosin alpha 4 chain confirmed immunoblotting. Localization tropomyosin alpha 4 chain ESCC cells adjacent fibroblasts confirmed immunohistochemistry.
