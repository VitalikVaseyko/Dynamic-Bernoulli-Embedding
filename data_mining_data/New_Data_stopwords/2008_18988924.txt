 Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) required normal cell metabolism mainly supplied mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), limited available oxygen modulated cell signaling pathways. Primary secondary OXPHOS failure shifts cell metabolism towards ATP generation glycolysis (Warburg effect). objective paper clarify role mitochondrial dysfunction cancer morphogenesis elucidate faulty morphogen gradient signaling inflammatory mediators regulate OXPHOS cause cancer-induced morphogenesis. Developmental morphogenesis cancer morphogenesis regulated morphogenetic fields. importance morphogenetic fields illustrated transplantation metastatic melanoma cells chick-embryo; tumor cells adapt morphologies resemble normal cells function normally host. morphogen gradient simple form morphogenetic field. Morphogens transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family inhibit stimulate basic cell proliferation high low concentrations respectively. Along signaling gradient declining TGF-beta concentration, increasing distance gradient source, cell proliferation first gradually less inhibited, gradually stimulated, thus generating concave curved structure. 3D cell cultures, TGF-beta concentration determines diameter tubules induces. TGF-beta1 modulate mitochondrial OXPHOS via adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) uncoupling protein (UCP) via COX-2 prostaglandin (PG) E2. Thus, gradients TGF-beta regulate radius curvature tissues modulating mitochondrial ATP generation. Derailment morphogen control mitochondrial ATP synthesis lead abnormal spatial variation ATP supply, abnormal spatial distribution cell proliferation, cancer morphogenesis. Involvement COX-2 morphogen signaling mechanism whereby inflammation promote carcinogenesis. Restoration OXPHOS reverse cancer morphogenesis restore normal tissue morphology. Avoiding exposure environmental mitochondrial toxins toxic food ingredients reduce risk cancer.
