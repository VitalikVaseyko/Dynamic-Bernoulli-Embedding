 Constraint-based metabolic modeling used capture genome-scale, systems properties organism's metabolism. first generation models built annotated gene sequence. field, need develop methods incorporate additional "omic" data types including transcriptomics, metabolomics, fluxomics facilitate construction, validation, predictive capabilities models. work herein combines metabolic flux data silico model central metabolism Escherichia coli model centric integration flux data. extreme pathways network, define allowable solution space possible flux distributions, analyzed using alpha-spectrum. alpha-spectrum determines extreme pathways cannot contribute metabolic flux distribution given condition gives allowable range weightings extreme pathway contribute. Since many extreme pathways cannot used certain conditions, result "condition-specific" solution space subset original solution space. alpha-spectrum results used create "condition-specific" extreme pathway matrix analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD). first mode SVD analysis characterizes solution space given condition. show SVD analysis alpha-spectrum extreme pathway matrix incorporates measured uptake byproduct secretion rates, predict internal flux trends different experimental conditions. predicted internal flux trends are, general, consistent flux trends measured using experimental metabolic flux analysis techniques.
