 Cervical cancer fourth common malignancy women worldwide, resistance chemotherapy drugs biggest obstacle treatment cervical cancers. present study, molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance human cervical cancer cells investigated. human cervical cancer cells treated 10 microg/ml cisplatin 24 48 h, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein expression levels significantly increased timedependent manner. Comparisons cisplatinsensitive HeLa cells cisplatinresistant HeLa/DDP cells revealed higher levels HMGB1 HeLa/DDP cells HeLa cells. Additionally, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value cisplatin HeLa/DDP cells 5.3fold HeLa cells. Analysis distribution cellular components revealed HMGB1 translocation nucleus cytoplasm contributed cisplatin resistance. confirmed demonstration ethyl pyruvate treatment suppressed cytoplasmic translocation HMGB1, resulting inhibition HeLa cell proliferation. Furthermore, endogenous HMGB1 inhibited HMGB1specific short hairpin (sh)RNA, MTT assay results showed interference HMGB1 expression reduced cell viability potentially reversed cisplatin resistance HeLa cells. Transfection HMGB1 shRNA demonstrated induce cell apoptosis HeLa cells, detected FACS analysis. addition, administration recombinant HMGB1 protein HeLa cells promoted cell autophagy, mediated phosphorylation extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2. Thus, cytoplasmic HMGB1 translocation HMGB1induced cell autophagy proposed contribute cisplatin resistance inhibiting apoptosis cervical cancer cells. HMGB1 could, therefore, represent novel therapeutic target for, diagnostic marker of, chemotherapy resistant cervical cancers.
