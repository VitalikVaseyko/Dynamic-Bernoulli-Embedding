 Clinical application recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) stroke limited hemorrhagic transformation, narrows rtPA's therapeutic window. addition, mounting evidence indicates rtPA potentially neurotoxic traverses compromised blood brain barrier. Here, demonstrated pyruvate protects cultured HT22 neuronal primary microvascular endothelial cells co-cultured primary astrocytes oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation stress rtPA cytotoxicity. 3 6h OGD, cells reoxygenated 11mmol/L glucose+/-pyruvate (8mmol/L) and/or rtPA (10microg/ml). Measured variables included cellular viability (calcein annexin-V/propidium iodide), reactive oxygen species (ROS; mitosox red 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate), NADPH, NADP(+) ATP contents (spectrophotometry), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) activities (gelatin zymography), cellular contents MMP2, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP2), phosphor-activation anti-apoptotic p70s6 kinase, Akt Erk (immunoblot). Pyruvate prevented loss HT22 cells 3h OGD+/-rtPA. 6h OGD, rtPA sharply lowered cell viability; pyruvate dampened effect. Three hours OGD 4h reoxygenation rtPA increased ROS formation 50%. Pyruvate prevented ROS formation doubled cellular NADPH/NADP(+) ratio ATP content. endothelial cell monolayers, 3h OGD 24h reoxygenation increased FITC-dextran leakage, indicating disruption intercellular junctions. Although rtPA exacerbated effect, pyruvate prevented sharply lowering MMP2/TIMP2 ratio increasing phosphorylation p70s6 kinase, Akt Erk. Pyruvate protects neuronal cells microvascular endothelium hypoxia-reoxygenation cytotoxic action rtPA reducing ROS activating anti-apoptotic signaling. results support proposed use pyruvate adjuvant dampen side effects rtPA treatment, thereby extending rtPA's therapeutic window.
