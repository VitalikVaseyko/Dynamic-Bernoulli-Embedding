 Diffuse gliomas secondary glioblastomas (GBMs) develop low-grade gliomas common incurable class brain tumor. Mutations metabolic enzyme glioblastomas (IDH1) represent distinguishing feature low-grade gliomas secondary GBMs. IDH1 mutations one common earliest detectable genetic alterations low-grade diffuse gliomas, evidence supports mutation driver gliomagenesis. Here, authors highlight biological consequences IDH1 mutations gliomas, clinical therapeutic/diagnostic implications, molecular subtypes tumors. also explore, brief, non-IDH1-mutated gliomas, including primary GBMs, molecular subtypes drivers tumors. fundamental understanding diversity GBMs lower-grade gliomas ultimately allow effective treatments predictors survival.
