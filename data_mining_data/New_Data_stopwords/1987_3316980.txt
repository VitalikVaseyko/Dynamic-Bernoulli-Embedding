 v-vis gene encodes p28sis, transforming protein simian sarcoma virus. gene resulted fusion env gene simian sarcoma-associated virus woolly monkey gene B chain platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Previous work shown v-sis gene product undergoes signal sequence cleavage, glycosylation, dimerization, proteolytic processing yield secreted form protein. transport across endoplasmic reticulum blocked introduction charged amino acid residue within signal sequence, protein dimerize, secreted, longer transforming assayed focus-forming ability NIH 3T3 cells. Instead, mutant protein localizes nucleus demonstrated indirect immunofluorescence cell fractionation. Using series deletion mutations, delimited amino acid sequence within protein responsible nuclear localization. region completely conserved predicted human c-sis protein, although lies outside regions required transformation v-sis gene product. nuclear transport signal contained within amino acid residues 237 255, RVTIRTVRVRRPPKGKHRK. amino acid sequence containing residues capable directing cytoplasmic v-sis mutant proteins nucleus. sequence also capable directing less efficient nuclear transport normally cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase. Pulse-chase experiments indicate half-lives nuclear cytoplasmic v-sis mutant proteins approximately 35 min. Using heat-inducible hsp70 promoter Drosophila melanogaster, showed nuclear v-sis protein accumulates nucleus within 30 min induction. identification nuclear transport signal v-sis gene product raises interesting questions regarding possibility function PDGF PDGF-related molecules nucleus.
