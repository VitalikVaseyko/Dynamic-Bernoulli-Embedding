 Many functional, morphological biochemical differences among hepatocytes different acinar zones described. Therefore, facilitate studies liver metabolism rapid, non-destructive procedures isolate hepatocytes zones. Flow cytometry new powerful tool which, however, used thus far accomplish separation hepatocytes different acinar zones. describe various cytometric parameters characterize hepatocyte populations, separated isopycnic centrifugation Percoll gradients. intraacinar origin different hepatocytes assessed enzymatic morphological measurements.
