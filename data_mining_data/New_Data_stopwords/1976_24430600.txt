 Crude extracts dark-kept resting cells chlorophyll-free, carotenoid-containing mutant Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck (211-11h/20) found convert 14.44+/-0.77 nmol PEP per min mg protein pyruvate action pyruvate kinase (=PK; EC 2.7.1.40). cells exposed blue light (lambda<550 nm, approximately 300 muW cm(-2)) 3 hrs PK-activity/protein crude extracts rose 21.47+/-1.30, i.e., enhanced 43%. Poisoning 10(-3) mol cycloheximide 150 mug actinomycin D/ml prevented effect blue light 80-90% (Table 1). result points induction enzyme synthesis blue light. Addition 1% glucose dark resulted increase PK-activity, too. Three hrs application glucose PK-activity 28.05+/-1.88 nmol/min mg protein, 94% greater control. effect glucose also largely preventable cycloheximide (10(-3) mol) actinomycin (150 mug/ml) (Table 2). results lead conclusion blue light may induce synthesis PK supplying free sugars site enzyme synthesis. assumption supported observation hot water extracts blue illuminated cells glucose oxidation poisoned by. 10(-2) mol monoiodoacetic acid 60% glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate sucrose detectable extracts equally poisoned algae darkness (Table 3). suggested blue light activates system transport sugar chloroplast, results induction respiratory enzyme synthesis thus enhanced respiration.
