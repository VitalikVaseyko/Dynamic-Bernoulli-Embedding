 BACKGROUND: extracts Artemisia annua Linne (AAE) known possess various functions including anti-bacterial, anti-virus anti-oxidant effects. However, mechanism effects AAE well known. Pursuantly, determined apoptotic effects extract AAE HCT116 cell. study, suggested AAE may exert cancer cell apoptosis PTEN/PDK1/Akt/p53signal pathway mitochondria-mediated apoptotic proteins. METHODS: measured 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, Hoechst 33342 staining, Annexin V-PI staining, Mitopotential assay, immunofluorescence (IF) Western blotting. Accordingly, study showed AAE treatment HCT116 cells resulted inhibition PDK1, Akt, MDM2, Bcl-2, pro-caspase 3 well activation PTEN, p53-upregulated modulator apoptosis (PUMA), Bax Bak expression. Also measured vivo assay xenograft model, H&E assay, TUNEL assay IHC. RESULTS: AAE induced apoptosis via PTEN/p53/PDK1/Akt signal pathways PTEN/p53-independent manner. AAE inhibit cell viability increase LDH release HCT116 colon cancer cell. Also, AAE increase apoptotic bodies, caspase -3,7 activation reduces mitochondria membrane potential. AAE regulates cytochrome c translocation cytoplasm Bax translocation mitochondrial membrane Immunofluorescence staining increase PTEN p53 expression vivo tumor xenograft model. elucidate role PTEN/p53/PDK1/Akt signal pathways cancer control, conditionally inactivated PTEN/p53/PDK1/Akt signal pathways. used inhibitors PTEN, p53, PDK1, Akt. consequence, results indicate AAE induced apoptosis means mitochondrial event regulation proteins Bax, Bak cytochrome c PDK1/Akt signaling pathways via PTEM/p53-independent manner. CONCLUSIONS: confirmed apoptotic effect extracts AAE Modulating PTEN/p53/PDK1/Akt/Signal Pathways PTEN/p53-independent pathwaysin HCT116 colon cancer cell.
