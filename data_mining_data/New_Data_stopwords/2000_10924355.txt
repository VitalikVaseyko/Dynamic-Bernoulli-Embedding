 Pyruvate cycling examined insect Manduca sexta L. (2-(13)C)pyruvate injected 5th instar larvae maintained semisynthetic high sucrose, low sucrose, sucrose-free diet. Pyruvate cycling gluconeogenesis determined distribution (13)C blood metabolites, including trehalose, blood sugar insects, alanine. Pyruvate cycling evident (13)C enrichment alanine C3, synthesized transamination pyruvate following carboxylation oxaloacetate cycling phosphoenolpyruvate. Based relative (13)C enrichments alanine C2 C3, insects maintained high sucrose diet displayed higher levels cycling insects diets. Insects diets, subsequently starved, displayed low levels cycling. Gluconeogenesis evident insects sucrose-free low sucrose diets selective (13)C enrichment trehalose. level gluconeogenesis relative glycolysis indicated (13)C enrichment trehalose C6 alanine C3, enrichments metabolically derived manner. Insects starved maintenance sucrose-free low sucrose diets remained glucogenic. Insects high sucrose diet glucogenic, subsequent starvation induce gluconeogenesis. results indicate pyruvate kinase plays critical role regulating gluconeogenic/glycolytic balance, inhibition pyruvate kinase principal regulatory event induction de novo trehalose synthesis. Gluconeogenesis failed maintain homeostatic levels blood trehalose, supporting conclusion blood sugar level may important mediating nutrient intake. Possible factors involved regulation gluconeogenesis insects discussed.
