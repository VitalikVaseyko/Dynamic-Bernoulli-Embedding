 Increased glucose utilization hallmark cancer, tumor metabolism emerging anticancer target therapeutic intervention. Triple-negative breast cancers TNBC highly glycolytic show poor clinical outcomes. previously identified hexokinase 2, major glycolytic enzyme, target gene miR-143 TNBC. Here, developed therapeutic formulation using cholesterol-modified miR-143 agomir encapsulated neutral lipid-based delivery agent blocked tumor growth glucose metabolism TNBC tumor-bearing mice administered systemically. antioncogenic effects accompanied reduction direct target hexokinase 2 [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake based positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Treatment miR-143 formulation minimal toxic effects mice tolerated well. Thus, demonstrated miR-143 robust inhibitor Warburg effect effective therapeutic target TNBC. addition, (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography used specifically monitor response TNBC miR-143-based therapeutics targeting tumor glycolysis.
