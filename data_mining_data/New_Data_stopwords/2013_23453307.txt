 study undertaken evaluate antidiabetic effect green tea extract carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes control streptozotocin high fat diet -induced diabetic rats. daily oral treatment green tea extract (300 mg/kg body weight) diabetic rats 30 days resulted significant reduction levels plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) increase levels insulin hemoglobin. altered activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase liver diabetic rats significantly reverted near normal levels administration green tea extract. Further, green tea extract administration diabetic rats improved muscle hepatic glycogen content suggesting antihyperglycemic potential green tea extract diabetic rats. obtained results compared metformin, standard oral hypoglycemic drug. Thus, study indicates administration green tea extract diabetic rats resulted alterations metabolism glucose subsequent reduction plasma glucose levels.
