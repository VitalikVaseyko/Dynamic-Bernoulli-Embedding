 Aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial dysfunction common features aggressive cancer growth. observed promoter methylation loss expression neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH) significant proportion primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) samples high tumor grade advanced stage. RNA interference-mediated knockdown NEFH accelerated ESCC cell growth culture increased tumorigenicity vivo, whereas forced expression NEFH significantly inhibited cell growth colony formation. Loss NEFH caused up-regulation pyruvate kinase-M2 type down-regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase, via activation Akt/beta-catenin pathway, resulting enhanced aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial dysfunction. acceleration glycolysis mitochondrial dysfunction NEFH-knockdown cells suppressed absence beta-catenin expression, decreased treatment 2-Deoxyglucose, glycolytic inhibitor, API-2, Akt inhibitor. Loss NEFH activates Akt/beta-catenin pathway increases glycolysis mitochondrial dysfunction. Cancer cells methylated NEFH targeted destruction specific inhibitors deregulated downstream pathways.
