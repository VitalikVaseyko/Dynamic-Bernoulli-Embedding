 reported diallyl disulfide (DADS) anti-proliferative activity many cancers. purpose study investigate functions DADS underlying mechanisms effect breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Mammosphere formation assay, glucose consumption assay, lactate production assay mouse xenograft experiments performed explore functions DADS BCSCs. ATPase activity assay, western blotting immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay conduct explore mechanisms underlying effects DADS BCSCs. results showed DADS suppressed cell stemness glucose metabolism BCSCs. vivo mouse xenograft experiments showed DADS inhibited proliferation metastasis BCSCs. Then, continued explore mechanisms underlying effects DADS BCSCs found DADS acts targeting CD44, Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. IHC analysis 125 breast cancer patients' tissues demonstrated CD44, PKM2 AMPK expression levels positively correlated. addition, positive CD44, PKM2 AMPK expression associated poor patient overall survival (OS) disease-free survival (DFS). summary, DADS suppresses cell stemness, proliferation, metastasis glucose metabolism BCSCs partly inhibition CD44/PKM2/AMPK. DADS may used potential therapy breast cancer treatment.
