 Male Jcl: Wistar rats exposed 2, 4, 10 ppm NO2 14, 10, 7 d, respectively, examine effect NO2 lung glycolytic pathway, major energy-generating system lung. highly significant increase activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase observed 5 exposure 10 ppm NO2, significantly higher value maintained 7. Similarly, activities enzymes examined increased significantly exposure 4 ppm NO2, reaching maximum 4 7 exposure, approached near control levels. remarkable increase found PK activity, reached 1.82- (p less 0.001) 1.53-fold (p less 0.001) control 5 (10 ppm) 7 (4 ppm) exposure, respectively. Upon exposure 2 ppm NO2, PK activity exposed animals also increased 1.23-fold (p less 0.05) control 7, higher activity maintained 14. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity exposed animals increased significantly 3, 4, 14 exposures 10, 4, 2 ppm NO2, respectively, significantly higher value maintained following period exposure. results show short-term exposure rats 2-10 ppm NO2 induces pulmonary systems concerning glycolysis NADPH-generation. generation energy NADPH lung may enhanced NO2 inhalation.
