 AIM: investigated effect elevated plasma free fatty acid insulin concentrations PDK4 mRNA transcript protein content long-chain acyl-coenzyme accumulation human skeletal muscle. METHODS: two occasions, 10 healthy men underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps 6 h (LIPID) without (CON) iv Intralipid (20% 90 ml/h) plus heparin (200 U prime + 600 U/h) infusion. RESULTS: Glucose disposal approximately 50% lower end clamp LIPID compared CON trial (37.8 +/- 4.4 79.6 +/- 4.0 micromol/kg lean mass.min, respectively; P < 0.01). LIPID trial, muscle long-chain acyl-coenzyme concentration increased 6 h, 3 h lipid infusion (P < 0.01). Muscle PDK4 mRNA, protein, down-regulated 2-fold within 3 h clamps decreased (6-fold; P < 0.01) 6 h CON LIPID clamp. lipid-induced attenuation suppression PDK4 gene expression dependent activation Akt/FOXO3 pathway. CONCLUSION: Accumulation im lipids plays important role impaired activation Akt-mediated pathways regulation muscle PDK4 gene expression lipid-induced acute insulin-resistant states.
