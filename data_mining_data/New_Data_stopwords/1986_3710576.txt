 kinetic immunological properties purified, homogeneous pyruvate kinase type M2 chicken lung tumors, including Rous sarcoma virus transformed chicken fibroblasts, compared. type M2 enzymes lung tumors immunologically distinct structures. enzyme isolated tumors characterized low affinity phosphoenol pyruvate, pronounced L-serine activation strong inhibition L-alanine, L-proline several amino acids. chicken lung enzyme slightly affected serine. cellular amino acid concentration range tumor enzyme strongly inhibited whereas lung enzyme partially inhibited. characteristics tumor enzyme allow optimal adaptation lactic acid production energy glucose amino acids dependent substrate oxygen supply.
