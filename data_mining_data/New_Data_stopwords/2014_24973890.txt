 modulated electrohyperthermia (mEHT) enrichment electric field concomitant heat selectively induce cell death malignant tumors result elevated glycolysis, lactate production (Warburg effect), reduced electric impedance cancer compared normal tissues. Earlier, showed HT29 colorectal cancer xenografts mEHT-provoked programmed cell death dominantly caspase independent driven apoptosis inducing factor activation. Using model here, studied mEHT-related cell stress 0-, 1-, 4-, 8-, 14-, 24-, 48-, 72-, 120-, 168- 216-h post-treatment focusing damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signals. Significant cell death response upon mEHT treatment accompanied early upregulation (4-h post-treatment) heat shock protein (Hsp70 Hsp90) mRNA levels. situ, treatment resulted spatiotemporal occurrence DAMP protein signal sequence featured significant cytoplasmic cell membrane translocation calreticulin 4 h, Hsp70 14 24 h Hsp90 24- 216-h post-treatment. release high-mobility group box1 protein (HMGB1) tumor cell nuclei 24-h post-treatment clearance tumor cells 48 h also detected. results suggest mEHT treatment induce DAMP-related signal sequence colorectal cancer xenografts may relevant promoting immunological cell death response, need tested immune-competent animals.
