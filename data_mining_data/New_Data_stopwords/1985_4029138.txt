 temperature-induced non-denaturing conformational transition rabbit muscle aldolase subject discussion controversy period time. study temperature dependence reactivity aldolase SH groups investigated order detect subtle changes enzyme conformation. model thiol-containing systems cysteine, glutathione bovine serum albumin, linear Arrhenius plots obtained reaction 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). hand, rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, protein undergoes temperature-induced conformational transition, plot obtained nonlinear break temperature (18 degrees C) close reported earlier. case aldolase Arrhenius plots three slowly reacting SH groups (Cys-72, 289, 338) fast reacting group (Cys-239) nonlinear break 26-27 degrees C. fluorescence measurements show plot fluorescence intensity tryptophan residues versus temperature exhibits break temperature. shown observed conformational change fully reversible. presence competitive inhibitor hexitol 1,6-bisphosphate, known protect Cys-72 Cys-338 chemical modification, Arrhenius plot exhibits break fast reacting Cys-239 residue linear slowly reacting Cys-289. found 0.6 urea increases transition temperature exposed SH groups aldolase. results show several points aldolase molecule, including active-site region, abrupt change microenvironments takes place temperature. competitive inhibitor protects portion aldolase molecule thermal transition.
