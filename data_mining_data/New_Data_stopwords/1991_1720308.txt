 messages LF-B1, interacts cis-acting element PKL-I play essential role expression L-type pyruvate kinase (PK) liver, L-type PK found present RIN-m5F insulinoma cells well liver, kidney small intestine, although levels two mRNAs tissues correlated. Gel retardation assay suggested similar nuclear proteins bound two cis-acting elements, PKL-II PKL-III, expressed liver insulinoma cells, additional PKL-III-binding proteins present RIN-m5F cells. Thus, suggest mechanism L-type PK expression pancreatic B cells similar liver.
