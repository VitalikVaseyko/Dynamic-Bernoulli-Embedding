 ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Heart-protecting musk pill (HMP), traditional Chinese medicine prescription, extensive cardioprotective effects angina pectoris myocardial infarction (MI), molecular mechanism behind cardio protective effects still remains unclear. article, aim investigate effect HMP mRNA expression MI rat. MATERIALS METHODS: rat model coronary artery ligation used assess cardioprotective effects HMP. Microarray technology applied detect gene expression heart MI rats treated HMP. Besides, quantitative real-time PCR performed verify microarray results. RESULTS: results showed HMP could ameliorate heart function, diminish infarct size MI rats. Compared sham-operated rats, 500 genes' expression changed, 234 genes down-regulated 266 genes up-regulated. expression 129 genes different HMP administrated rats MI rats, 22 genes down-regulated 107 genes up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: Citrate cycle (TCA cycle), Valine, leucine isoleucine degradation, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis Pyruvate metabolism pathway probably involved cardioprotective effects HMP.
