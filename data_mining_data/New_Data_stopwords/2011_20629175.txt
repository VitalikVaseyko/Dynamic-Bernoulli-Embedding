 study rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (M1-PYK), proline previously used osmolyte attempt determine role preexisting conformational equilibria allosteric regulation. context, osmolytes small molecules assumed direct interaction protein. contrast proline's proposed role osmolyte, structure M1PYK-Mn-pyruvate-proline complex reported herein demonstrates proline binds specifically allosteric site M1-PYK. Therefore, amino acid allosteric effector rather benign osmolyte. compounds often used osmolytes (polyethyleneglycol glycerol) also present structure, suggesting interaction protein would, turn, prevent usefulness compounds study likely proteins. findings highlight need verify compounds used osmolytes perturb preexisting conformational equilibrium directly interact protein, consideration commonly addressed past.
