 ADP ribosylation presence cholera pertussis toxin indicated presence G-proteins Nb2 cell membranes. Two protein bands, mol wt 43.5K 46.5K, radiolabeled cholera toxin, single protein (41.5K mol wt) ADP ribosylated pertussis toxin. Northern hybridization total RNA Nb2 cells specific cDNA probes indicated presence mRNA transcripts encoding Gs, Gi2, Go, and, lesser extent, Gi3. characteristic receptors coupled G-proteins binding properties regulated guanine nucleotides. binding [125I]human GH lactogen receptor well binding [125I]IL-2 IL-2 receptor decreased dose-dependent manner GTP, GDP, analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). GMP, however, effect. addition pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate regenerate GTP GDP greatly increased apparent potency GTP. Cholera toxin inhibited PRL- interleukin-2-stimulated DNA synthesis cell proliferation Nb2 cells. contrast, pertussis toxin differential effect PRL- IL-2-stimulated cells. Pertussis toxin, optimal concentration 0.01 ng/ml, significantly enhanced stimulatory effects PRL DNA synthesis (P less equal 0.01; n = 9) cell proliferation (P less equal 0.05; n = 9) compared effect PRL alone. However, higher concentrations toxin inhibited PRL-stimulated DNA synthesis cell proliferation. Complete inhibition achieved 1000 ng/ml toxin. contrast biphasic effect PRL-stimulated cells, pertussis toxin weakly inhibitory cells treated IL-2. highest concentration tested, pertussis toxin (1000 ng/ml) inhibited IL-2-stimulated DNA synthesis cell growth 30-35%. (Bu)2cAMP (IC50 = 0.019 mM) methylxanthine (MIX; IC50 = 0.25 mM) also inhibited PRL-stimulated DNA synthesis. absence mitogen, neither agent, 0.0001-1 mM, effect DNA synthesis. Similarly, IL-2-stimulated DNA synthesis Nb2 cells inhibited (Bu)2cAMP (IC50 = 0.019 mM) MIX (IC50 = 0.072 mM). However, MIX approximately 3 times potent inhibiting cell response IL-2 PRL. susceptibility Nb2 cells bacterial toxins suggests role G-proteins regulating PRL- IL-2-stimulated mitogenesis cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
