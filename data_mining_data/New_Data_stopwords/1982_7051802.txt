 effect resuming food intake period starvation (refeeding) specific activities selected rat intestinal enzymes determined. rate weight gain higher refed animals control animals, without difference food intake. Fasting caused intestinal atrophy reversed rapidly refeeding. Fasting decreased specific activities sucrase, maltase, galactokinase, affect specific activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, crypt thymidine kinase. Sucrase, maltase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, thymidine kinase specific activities rose control values refeeding. overshoot intestinal enzyme specific activities may help promote rapid weight gain observed refed rats integral part total adaptation fasting refeeding.
