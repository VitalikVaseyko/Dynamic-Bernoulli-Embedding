 solid tumors, cancer stem cells (CSCs) arise independently epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). spite recent efforts, metabolic reprogramming associated CSC phenotypes uncoupled EMT poorly understood. Here, using metabolomic fluxomic approaches, identify major metabolic profiles differentiate metastatic prostate epithelial CSCs (e-CSCs) non-CSCs expressing stable EMT. found e-CSC program cellular model characterized high plasticity energy substrate metabolism, including enhanced Warburg effect, greater carbon energy source flexibility driven fatty acids amino acid metabolism essential reliance proton buffering capacity conferred glutamine metabolism. analysis transcriptomic data yielded metabolic gene signature e-CSCs consistent metabolomics fluxomics analyses correlated tumor progression metastasis prostate cancer 11 additional cancer types. Interestingly, integrated metabolomics, fluxomics, transcriptomics analysis allowed us identify key metabolic players regulated post-transcriptional level, suggesting potential biomarkers therapeutic targets effectively forestall metastasis.
