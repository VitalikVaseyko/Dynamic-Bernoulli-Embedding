 Sphingomonas paucimobilis var. EPA505 utilizes fluoranthene (FLA), naphthalene (NAP), phenanthrene (PHE) sole carbon sources energy growth. genetic library EPA505 constructed using mini-Tn5 promoter reporter genes encoding tetracycline resistance (tc(p-)) luminescence (luxAB(p-)). 2250 Tn5 mutants, ten deficient utilization FLA, NAP, and/or PHE sole carbon sources. Three classes Tn5 mutants defined: classI (nap(-)phe(-)fla(-)), classII (nap(-)phe(-)), classIII (fla(-)). Four five mutants classI express dioxygenase function, whereas one classI mutant classII classIII mutants retained dioxygenase activity. Tn5 tc(p-) classI mutants 200 394 (dioxygenase negative) classII mutant 132 (dioxygenase positive), promoter reporter expressed induced FLA, NAP, PHE, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), several proposed PAH-derived catabolites. Tn5 tc(p-) derived classIII mutant 104 induced PAHs PAH-derived catabolites. DNA sequence analysis cloned regions classI mutant 200 revealed Tn5 inserted gene shared (96%) DNA sequence homology 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase designated pbhA. Nucleotide sequences downstream pbhA shared (84%) homology Rieske-type ferredoxin subunit gene multicomponent dioxygenase designated pbhB. Tn5 tc(p-) classII mutant 132 occurred within sequences shared (74%) homology trans-o-hydroxybenzylidene-pyruvate hydratase-aldolase gene (pbhC). Sequence analysis region proximal gene revealed putative promoter contained binding site LysR transcriptional activator. classIII mutant 104, Tn5 tc(p-) resided within region shared 94% nucleotide homology pyruvate phosphate dikinase gene known involved cellular uptake glucose. FLA-specific catabolic gene disrupted mutant 104 designated phbD. Functional sequence analyses promoter probe mutants allowed identification four genes necessary utilization PAHs controlled least two promoters affected wide range aromatic compounds.
