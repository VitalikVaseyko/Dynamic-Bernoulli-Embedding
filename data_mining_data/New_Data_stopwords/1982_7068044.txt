 Enzymes activities homogenates large intestine measured biopsies 11 tubular adenomas six carcinomas corresponding normal mucosa individual. similar significant increase found total activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase adenomas carcinomas compared levels normal mucosa. lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme patterns showed also marked similar change adenomas carcinomas significant increase lactate dehydrogenase M-monomers. adenomas showed slight moderate dysplasia. results indicate measurement total G 6 PD, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activities screening purposes predictive value separating non-premalignant premalignant adenomas. Moreover, seems enzymatic characteristics malignancy present even tubular adenomas. agreement theory polyp-cancer sequence.
