 Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) activation/phosphorylation angiotensin II (Ang II) critical signaling event hypertrophy vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Conventional wisdom asserts Akt activation occurs mainly plasma membrane domains. Recent evidence Akt activation may take place within intracellular compartments challenges dogma. spatial identity mechanistic features putative signaling domains defined. Using cell fractionation fluorescence methods, demonstrate early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1)-positive endosomes major site Ang II-induced Akt activation. Akt moves activated EEA1 endosomes. expression EEA1 required phosphorylation Akt Thr-308 Ser-473 well phosphorylation downstream targets mTOR S6 kinase, Erk1/2 activation. Akt phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) interact EEA1. also found PKC-alpha required organizing Ang II-induced, EEA1-dependent Akt phosphorylation VSMC early endosomes. EEA1 expression enables PKC-alpha phosphorylation, turn regulates Akt upstream signaling kinases, PDK1 p38 MAPK. results indicate PKC-alpha necessary regulator EEA1-dependent Akt signaling early endosomes. Finally, EEA1 down-regulation expression dominant negative mutant PKC-alpha blunts Ang II-induced leucine incorporation VSMCs. Thus, EEA1 serves novel function obligate scaffold Ang II-induced Akt activation early endosomes.
