 BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy cured immunodeficiencies including X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) adenine deaminase deficiency (ADA). immunodeficiencies corrected cells selective advantage vivo, low numbers gene-modified cells sufficient provide therapeutic benefit. Strategies efficiently transduce and/or expand long-term repopulating cells vivo needed treatment diseases require higher levels corrected cells, hemoglobinopathies. expanded corrected stem cells vivo canine model severe erythroid disease, pyruvate kinase deficiency. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: used foamy virus (FV) vector expressing P140K mutant methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMTP140K) vivo expansion corrected hematopoietic repopulating cells. FV vectors attractive gene transfer vectors hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy since efficiently transduce repopulating cells may safer commonly used gammaretroviral vectors. Following transplantation HSCs transduced ex vivo using tri-cistronic FV vector expressed EGFP, R-type pyruvate kinase, MGMTP140K, able increase marking approximately 3.5% 33% myeloid long-term repopulating cells resulting functional cure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: describe one affected dog functional cure severe erythroid disease using stem cell selection vivo. addition providing potential cure patients pyruvate kinase deficiency, vivo selection using foamy vectors MGMTP140K broad potential several hematopoietic diseases including hemoglobinopathies.
