 aim paper describe clinical hematological characteristics 32-year-old woman concomitant heterozygous pyruvate kinase (PK) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiencies severe hemolytic anemia pregnancy. 1964, Oski et al. described family clinically healthy woman heterozygous PK G6PD deficiencies. knowledge, present case first described condition associated hemolysis. heterozygous condition enzymopathies clearly demonstrated family study criteria, causes hemolytic anemia eliminated. evidence genetic relationship two disorders demonstrated. Since late onset hemolysis heterozygous PK-deficient women observed association pregnancy molecular characteristics concomitant deficient G6PD enzyme kinetically favorable, partial PK deficiency suggested major cause hemolysis patient.
