 enzyme activities isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH, NADP-specific), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) studied third-stage juveniles Steinernema carpocapsae. Reaction requirements, pH optima, substrate cofactor kinetic constants similar reported previously parasitic helminths exception LDH, unstable could characterized specific activity kinetic constants. respective pH optima 7.5 ICDH, 8.8 MDH, 6.5 PEPCK, 7.3 PFK, 7.2 PK, 7.5 FBPase. specific activities ICDH, MDH, PEPCK, PFK, PK, FBPase pH 7.5 4.8, 1,300, 22, 25, 35, 6.8 (nmoles substrate min(1) mg protein(1)), respectively. summary, infective juveniles S. carpocapsae display metabolism typical facultative aerobe.
