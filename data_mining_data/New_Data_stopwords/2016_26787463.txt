 Maf1 protein general negative repressor RNA polymerase III, conserved eukaryotes yeast humans. Herein, show yeast maf1Delta mutant increases pyruvate kinase activity, key enzyme glycolysis important player switching fermentative oxidative metabolism. observed enhanced ethanol production elevated lipid content maf1Delta strain grown glucose. However, shifting non-fermentable carbon source, opposite effect observed, mutant cells accumulated smaller lipid droplets. Thus, concluded Maf1 protein essential regulation glucose metabolism lipid homeostasis.
