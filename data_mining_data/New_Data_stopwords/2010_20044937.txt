 BACKGROUND: Phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEPS; EC 2.7.9.2) catalyzes synthesis phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate Escherichia coli cells grown three carbon source. also catalyses anabolic conversion pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate gluconeogenesis. bioinformatics search conducted following successful cloning expression maize leaf pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase regulatory protein (PDRP) revealed presence PDRP homologs 300 bacterial species; PDRP homolog identified DUF299. RESULTS: paper describes cloning expression PEPS DUF299 E. coli establishes E. coli DUF299 catalyzes ADP-dependent inactivation Pi-dependent activation PEPS. CONCLUSION: paper represents first report bifunctional regulatory enzyme catalysing ADP-dependent phosphorylation Pi-dependent pyrophosphorylation reaction bacteria.
