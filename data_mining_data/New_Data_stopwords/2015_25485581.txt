 Serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP) TGF-beta receptor-interacting protein participates regulation cell proliferation cell death response various stresses. Here, demonstrate STRAP phosphorylation plays important role determining pro- anti-apoptotic function STRAP. Murine protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38) phosphorylates STRAP Ser(188) via direct interaction. Complex formation STRAP MPK38 mediated Cys(152) Cys(270) STRAP Cys(339) Cys(377) MPK38, suggesting redox dependency interaction. MPK38-mediated STRAP Ser(188) phosphorylation contributes pro-apoptotic function STRAP modulating key steps STRAP-dependent ASK1, TGF-beta, p53, PI3K/PDK1 signaling pathways. Moreover, knockdown endogenous MPK38 using inducible MPK38 shRNA system vivo activation MPK38 treatment HEK293 STRAP-null MEF cells 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), specific inhibitor Trx reductase, provide evidence STRAP Ser(188) phosphorylation plays key role STRAP-dependent cell death. Adenoviral delivery MPK38 mice also demonstrates STRAP Ser(188) phosphorylation liver tightly associated cell death proliferation ASK1, TGF-beta, p53, PI3K/PDK1 pathways, resulting apoptotic cell death.
