 study myofibrillar proteins, Chowrashi Pepe [1982: J. Cell Biol. 94:565-573] reported isolation new, 85-kD Z-band protein named amorphin. report partial sequences purified amorphin protein indicate amorphin identical phosphorylase, enzyme important metabolism glycogen. Anti-amorphin antibodies also reacted purified chicken rabbit phosphorylase. explore basis phosphorylase's (amorphin's) localization Z-bands skeletal muscles, reacted biotinylated alpha-actinin purified amorphin purified phosphorylase found alpha-actinin bound each. Radioimmune assays also indicated phosphorylase (amorphin) bound alpha-actinin, and, lower affinity, F-actin. Negative staining actin filaments demonstrated alpha-actinin mediates binding phosphorylase actin filaments. several glycolytic enzymes bind actin (e.g., aldolase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase), phosphorylase first one demonstrated bind alpha-actinin. Localization phosphorylase live cells assessed transfecting cultures quail embryonic myotubes plasmids expressing phosphorylase fused Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). resulted targeting fusion protein Z-bands accompanied diffuse pattern cytoplasm.
