 reported 40-year-old male adult-onset nemaline myopathy (adult-onset rod disease) showing muscular hypertrophy distal limbs. age 25, noticed thinness thighs. Difficulty climbing stairs slowly progressed age 35. admission neurological examination revealed muscular weakness atrophy proximal limbs hypertrophy distal flexors. Normal laboratory tests included serum creatine kinase, myoglobin, aldolase pyruvate. Electromyography revealed severe neurogenic changes right biceps brachial muscle right quadriceps muscle, moderate changes right gastrocnemius. Biopsy specimen deltoid muscle demonstrated type 1 fiber predominance type 1 fiber atrophy, small group atrophy type grouping. Abundant nemaline rods found mainly type 1 fibers (81.5%). order evaluate hypertrophy calf muscles, T1-weighted MRI lower extremity performed. transaxial images mid thigh showed moderate fatty replacement, increased volume little fatty replacement found mid calf. Therefore, hypertrophy calf muscle seemed compensative hypertrophy. case neurogenic factors indicated electromyographically histologically. findings may advocate notion neurogenic factors involved congenital adult-onset rod disease.
