 aim work investigate stereoselectivity maize leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase E- Z-2-phosphoenolbutyrate inhibitors substrates. addition, procedure presented separation isomers 2-phosphoenolbutyrate. method based different interaction compounds strong anion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography column using 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 3) elution buffer, allows obtention pure E- Z-P-enolbutyrate high yield. system used identify Z-P-enolbutyrate product phosphorylation 2-oxobutyrate rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. presence 5 mM Mg2+, isomers P-enolbutyrate inhibited C4-plant P-enolpyruvate carboxylase; values Ki 15-20 microM 100-110 microM Z- E-P-enolbutyrate, respectively. 0.5 mM Mn2+, Z isomer also effective inhibitor (Ki = 35-40 microM), E isomer produced activation carboxylase probably due binding allosteric site. compounds substrates enzyme similar V/Km values; however, V Km two isomers significantly different (i.e. Km = 110 microM Z-P-enolbutyrate 220 microM E-P-enolbutyrate). results indicate existence stereoselectivity binding P-enolbutyrate active site P-enolpyruvate carboxylase. However, fact affect use isomers substrates plant carboxylase.
