 present study designed examine functional relevance two heterozygous mutations (H391Y K422R), observed earlier us Bloom syndrome condition. Cells stably expressing exogenous wild-type mutant PKM2 (K422R H391Y) co-expressing wild type mutant (PKM2-K422R PKM2-H391Y) assessed cancer metabolism tumorigenic potential. Interestingly, cells co-expressing PKM2 mutant (K422R H391Y) showed significantly aggressive cancer metabolism compared cells expressing either wild-type mutant PKM2 independently. similar trend observed oxidative endurance, tumorigenic potential, cellular proliferation, tumor growth. observations signify dominant negative nature mutations. Remarkably, PKM2-H391Y co-expressed cells showed maximal effect studied parameters. dominant negative impaired function PKM2 tumor development known; study demonstrates first time possible predisposition Bloom syndrome patients impaired PKM2 activity cancer importance studying genetic variations PKM2 future understand relevance cancer general.
