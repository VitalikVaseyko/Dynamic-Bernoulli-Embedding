 Muscle biopsies taken musculus quadriceps femoris man analysed pH, ATP, ADP, AMP, creatine phosphate, creatine, lactate pyruvate. Biopsies taken rest, circulatory occlusion isometric contraction. Muscle pH decreased 7.09 rest 6.56 isometric exercise fatigue. Decrease muscle pH linearly related accumulation lactate plus pyruvate. increase 22mumol lactate plus pyruvate per g muscle resulted fall 0.5pH unit. apparent equilibrium constant creatine kinase reaction (apparent K(CK)) increased isometric contraction linear relationship log(apparent K(CK)) muscle pH obtained. low content creatine phosphate muscle contraction analysed needle-biopsy samples believed consequence altered equilibrium state creatine kinase reaction. turn attributed mainly change intracellular pH.
