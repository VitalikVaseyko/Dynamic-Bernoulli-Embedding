 present treatment thalassaemia major consists regular blood transfusions coupled chelation therapy using deferoxamine. complementary approach problem use blood units enriched young red cells (neocytes), reduce transfusional frequency thereby diminish risk iron overload. Young red cell units collected blood 60 volunteer donors using cell separator (IBM 2997). Donors' blood anticoagulated young red cell harvesting carried 4 h constant rotor speed 500 rpm. Three biological criteria used evaluate young red cell quality: number reticulocytes, pyruvate kinase activity mean corpuscular volume, show enrichment young red cells compared standard donor units. 51Cr young red cell survival four normal donors two splenectomized patients showed increased red cell half-life compared study performed standard blood units. Blood consumption diminished significantly two patients transfused young red cell units. must emphasized that, despite high cost blood product, efficiency transfusion technique, reducing blood consumption, represents important progress hopeful treatment chronic anaemia.
