 BACKGROUND/AIMS: earlier study suggested platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- betabeta receptor regulates chemotaxis human malignant mesothelioma cells MSTO-211H, NCIH-2052, NCIH-2452, NCIH-28 cells, non-malignant Met5A cells. present study designed gain insight PDGF-betabeta receptor signals underlying chemotaxis. METHODS: PDGF-D secreted cells, activation Akt ERK, cell migration monitored cells without knocking-down PDGF-betabeta receptor. RESULTS: FBS significantly stimulated PDGF-D secretion malignant mesothelioma cells, Met5A cells. PDGF-D activated Akt ERK non-malignant malignant cells. PDGF-D significantly facilitated migration malignant mesothelioma cells, Met5A cells, extent varying among cell types. facilitatory action PDGF-D clearly prevented knocking-down PDGF-betabeta receptor inhibitors PI3 kinase, PDK1, Akt, Rac1, ROCK, MEK. CONCLUSION: results present study indicate PDGF-D promotes malignant mesothelioma cell chemotaxis PDGF-betabeta receptor signaling pathways along PI3 kinase/PDK1/Akt/Rac1/ROCK axis relevant ERK activation.
