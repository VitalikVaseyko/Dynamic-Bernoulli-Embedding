 3-Phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), phosphorylates activates group kinases, plays important roles cellular metabolism, growth, proliferation survival. However, functions PDK1 central nervous system (CNS) injury remain enigma. elucidate expressions possible functions PDK1 phosphorylation CNS injury repair, performed acute spinal cord injury (SCI) model adult rats detected expression localization serine-241 phosphorylated PDK1 (p-PDK1s241). Western blot immunohistochemistry showed serine-241 phosphorylated PDK1 (p-PDK1s241) started increasing 6h damage peaked 12h, declined basal levels 3days injury. Immunohistochemical staining also revealed subcellular localization changes p-PDK1s241 staining nucleus cytoplasm injury including neurons glial cells. Double immunofluorescence labeling suggested p-PDK1s241 primarily localizes neurons oligodendrocytes. might also expressed glial cells spinal cord tissues within 2mm epicenter 12h post-injury. Moreover, double staining indicated p-PDK1s241 active caspase-3 showed different cellular distributions SCI. Together previous reports, hypothesize phosphorylation PDK1 may associated cell survival suggest PDK1 novel target neuroprotection functional repair SCI.
