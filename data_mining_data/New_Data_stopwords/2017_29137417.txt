 Dysregulation metabolism melanoma progression tightly associated acquisition genetic epigenetic alterations regulators metabolic pathways. Retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) epigenetically silenced large proportion melanomas, link RARbeta metabolic rewiring melanoma established. Here, show primary human melanocytes, all-trans retinoic acid (a RARbeta agonist) induced growth inhibition accompanied decrease glycolytic oxidative metabolism, whereas selective inhibition RARbeta led increase basal glycolytic rate increased sensitivity inhibition glycolysis. melanoma cells, inhibition RARbeta promoted lower mitochondrial respiration higher glycolytic activity, led energetic stress activation energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase. metabolic shift increased sensitivity glycolytic inhibition stimulation mitochondrial metabolism dichloroacetate, inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. melanoma cells harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation, RARbeta activation antagonized effect BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib). Collectively, data suggest RARbeta signaling involved regulating cellular metabolism melanoma may provide potential target combination treatment strategies.
