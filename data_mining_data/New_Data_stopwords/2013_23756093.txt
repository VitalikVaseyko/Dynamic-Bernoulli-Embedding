 Stem progenitor cells proliferate give rise types cells differentiation. Deregulation process lead many diseases including cancer. Recent evidence suggests extensive metabolic reconfiguration cancer cells allows sustain pathological growth providing anabolic intermediates biosynthesis. raises question physiological role metabolic pathways normal cell growth differentiation. Metabolism changes differentiation, metabolic pathways may controlled signals control cell proliferation differentiation. However, metabolism could also reciprocally influence signals. role metabolic regulation may extend beyond provision intermediates biosynthetic needs proliferation, affect cell differentiation. bring together large number recent studies support suggestion illustrate mechanisms metabolism linked cell proliferation differentiation.
