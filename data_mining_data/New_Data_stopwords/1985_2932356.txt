 potent tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced rapid increase glycolysis rat thymocytes. increase glycolytic flux also reflected elevated fructose 1,6-diphosphate levels. TPA treatment result increase hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase measured cell homogenates. suggested early increase glycolysis TPA treated lymphocytes may result TPA-mediated increase glucose transport.
