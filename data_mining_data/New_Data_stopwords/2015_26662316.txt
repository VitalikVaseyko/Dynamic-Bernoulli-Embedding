 Warburg effect characterized increased utilization glucose via glycolysis cancer cells, even enough oxygen present properly respire. Recent studies demonstrate deregulation microRNAs contributes Warburg effect. present study, show miR-144 downregulated glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) upregulated ovarian cancers. vitro studies showed miR-144 inhibits Glut1 expression targeting 3'-untranslated region. result, cells overexpressing miR-144 exhibited metabolic shift, including enhanced glucose uptake lactate production. altered glucose metabolism induced miR-144 also leads rapid growth ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, results indicate miR-144 may serve molecular switch regulate glycolysis ovarian cancer targeting expression Glut1.
