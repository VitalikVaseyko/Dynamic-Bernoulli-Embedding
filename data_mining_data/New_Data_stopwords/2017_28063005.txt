 Albendazole (ABZ) anti-tumor ability inhibits HIF-1alpha activity. HIF-1alpha associated glycolysis vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) expression, plays important role cancer progression. clues indicate ABZ exerts anti-cancer effect regulating glycolysis VEGF expression. aim study clarify effects ABZ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells explore underlying molecular mechanisms. expression levels HIF-1alpha VEGF detected using western blot analysis, effect ABZ glycolysis evaluated measuring relative activities hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) detecting production lactate A549 H1299 cells. results showed ABZ decreased expression levels HIF-1alpha VEGF suppressed glycolysis hypoxia, normoxic condition. Inhibiting HIF-1alpha also suppressed glycolysis VEGF expression. Additionally, ABZ inhibited volume weight, decreased relative activities HK, PK, LDH, reduced levels HIF-1alpha VEGF A549 xenografts mouse models. conclusion, ABZ inhibited growth NSCLC cells suppressing HIF-1alpha-dependent glycolysis VEGF expression.
