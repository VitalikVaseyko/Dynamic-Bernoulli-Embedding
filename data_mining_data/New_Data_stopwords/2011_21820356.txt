 BACKGROUND: Muscle biopsy gold standard diagnosis mitochondrial disorders lack sensitive biomarkers serum. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) growth factor regulatory roles lipid metabolism starvation response, concentrations raised skeletal muscle serum mice mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies. investigated retrospective diagnostic study whether FGF-21 could biomarker human mitochondrial disorders. METHODS: assessed samples adults children mitochondrial disorders non-mitochondrial neurological disorders (disease controls) seven study centres Europe USA, recruited healthy volunteers (healthy controls), matched age possible, centres. used ELISA measure FGF-21 concentrations serum plasma samples (abnormal values defined >200 pg/mL). compared concentrations values lactate, pyruvate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, creatine kinase serum plasma calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive negative predictive values biomarkers. FINDINGS: analysed serum plasma 67 patients (41 adults 26 children) mitochondrial disorders, 34 disease controls (22 adults 12 children), 74 healthy controls. Mean FGF-21 concentrations serum 820 (SD 1151) pg/mL adult 1983 (1550) pg/mL child patients respiratory chain deficiencies 76 (58) pg/mL healthy controls. FGF-21 concentrations high patients mitochondrial disorders affecting skeletal muscle disease controls, including dystrophies. patients abnormal FGF-21 concentrations serum, odds ratio muscle-manifesting mitochondrial disease 132.0 (95% CI 38.7-450.3). identification muscle-manifesting mitochondrial disease, sensitivity 92.3% (95% CI 81.5-97.9%) specificity 91.7% (84.8-96.1%). positive negative predictive values FGF-21 84.2% (95% CI 72.1-92.5%) 96.1 (90.4-98.9%). accuracy FGF-21 correctly identify muscle-manifesting respiratory chain disorders better conventional biomarkers. area receiver-operating-characteristic curve FGF-21 0.95; comparison, values biomarkers 0.83 lactate (p=0.037, 0.83 pyruvate (p=0.015), 0.72 lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (p=0.0002), 0.77 creatine kinase (p=0.013). INTERPRETATION: Measurement FGF-21 concentrations serum identified primary muscle-manifesting respiratory chain deficiencies adults children might feasible first-line diagnostic test disorders reduce need muscle biopsy.
