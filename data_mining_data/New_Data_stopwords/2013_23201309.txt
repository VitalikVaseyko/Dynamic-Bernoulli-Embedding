 Nucleoside analogues, used HIV-therapy, need phosphorylated cellular enzymes order become potential substrates HIV reverse transcriptase. incorporation viral DNA chain, lacking 3'-hydroxyl groups, stop elongation process lead death virus. Phosphorylation HIV-drug derivative, tenofovir monophosphate tested recombinant mammalian nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), creatine kinase (CK) pyruvate kinase (PK). Among them, CK found phosphorylate tenofovir monophosphate reasonable rate (about 45-fold lower natural substrate, ADP), PK exhibits even lower, still detectable activity (about 1000-fold lower compared value ADP). hand, neither NDPK PGK detectable activity tenofovir monophosphate. absence activity PGK surprising, since drug tenofovir competitively inhibits CK PGK towards nucleotide substrates, similar inhibitory constants, K(I) 2.9 4.8mM, respectively. Computer modelling (docking) tenofovir mono- diphosphate forms four kinases suggests requirement large-scale domain closure functioning (as PGK) may largely restrict applicability phosphorylation/activation pro-drugs structure similar tenofovir monophosphate.
