 Lactobacillus casei Zhang, isolated traditional home-made koumiss Inner Mongolia China, considered new probiotic bacterium probiotic selection tests. carried proteomics study identify characterize proteins expressed L. casei Zhang exponential phase stationary phase. Cytosolic proteins strain cultivated de Man, Rogosa, Sharpe broth resolved two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using pH 4-7 linear gradients. number protein spots quantified gels 487 +/- 21 (exponential phase) 494 +/- 13 (stationary phase) among total 131 spots identified MALDI-TOF/MS and/or MALDI-TOF/TOF according significant growth phase-related differences high expression intensity proteins. Accompanied cluster orthologous groups (COG), codon adaptation index (CAI), GRAVY value analysis, study provided first insight profile protein expression reference map L. casei. Forty-seven spots also found study showed statistically significant differences exponential phase stationary phase. Thirty-three spots increased least 2.5-fold stationary phase comparison exponential phase, including 19 protein spots (e.g. Hsp20, DnaK, GroEL, LuxS, pyruvate kinase, GalU) whose intensity up-shifted 3.0-fold. Transcriptional profiles conducted confirm several important differentially expressed proteins using real time quantitative PCR. analysis suggests differentially expressed proteins mainly categorized stress response proteins key components central intermediary metabolism, indicating proteins might play potential important role adaptation surroundings, especially accumulation lactic acid course growth, physiological processes bacteria cell.
