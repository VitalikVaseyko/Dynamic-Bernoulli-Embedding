 BACKGROUND: AGC protein kinase family regulates multiple cellular functions. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) involved pathogenesis arrhythmia, downstream factor, Forkhead box O1 (Foxo1), negatively regulates expression cardiac sodium channel, Nav1.5. Mice known die suddenly PDK1 deletion within 11 weeks, underlying electrophysiological bases unclear. Thus, aim study investigate potential mechanisms PDK1 signaling pathway cardiac sodium current. METHODS RESULTS: Using patch clamp western blotting techniques, investigated role PDK1-Foxo1 pathway PDK1 knockout mice cultured cardiomyocytes. found PDK1 knockout mice undergo slower heart rate, prolonged QRS QTc intervals abnormal conduction within first weeks birth. Furthermore, peak sodium current decreased 33% cells lacking PDK1. phosphorylation Akt (308T) Foxo1 (24T) expression Nav1.5 myocardium PDK1-knockout mice decreased, nuclear localization Foxo1 increased. role PDK1-Foxo1 pathway regulating Nav1.5 levels sodium current density verified using selective PDK1, Akt Foxo1 inhibitors isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSION: results indicate PDK1 participates dysregulation electrophysiological basis regulating PDK1-Foxo1 pathway, turn regulates expression Nav1.5 cardiac sodium channel function.
