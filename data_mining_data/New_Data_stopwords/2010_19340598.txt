 60-day experiment conducted study effect dietary gelatinized (G) non-gelatinized (NG) starch key metabolic enzymes glycolysis (hexokinase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), gluconeogenesis (glucose-6 phosphatase fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase), protein metabolism (aspartate amino transferase alanine amino transferase), TCA cycle (malate dehydrogenase) Labeo rohita juveniles. analysis, 234 juveniles (2.53 +/- 0.04 g) randomly distributed six treatment groups three replicates. Six semi-purified diets containing NG G cornstarch, six levels inclusion (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) prepared viz., T1 (100% NG, 0% G starch), T2 (80% NG, 20% G starch), T3 (60% NG, 40% G starch), T4 (40% NG, 60% G starch), T5 (20% NG, 80% G starch), T6 (0% NG, 100% G starch). Dietary G:NG starch ratio significant (P < 0.05) effect glycolytic enzymes, highest activities observed T6 group lowest T1 group. contrary, gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase activities organs, liver kidney recorded highest T1 group lowest T6 group. liver aspartate amino transferase activity showed increasing trend decrease dietary G level. However, muscle aspartate amino transferase activity significantly (P > 0.05) influenced type dietary starch. alanine amino transferase activity liver muscle showed increasing trend decrease dietary G level. liver muscle malate dehydrogenase activities lowest T6 group highest T1 group. Results suggest NG (100%) starch diet significantly induced enzyme activities amino acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, whereas partial total replacement raw starch gelatinized starch increased glycolytic enzyme activity.
