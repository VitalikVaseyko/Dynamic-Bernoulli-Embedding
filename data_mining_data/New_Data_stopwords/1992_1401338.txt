 Glucose metabolism studied Salmo trutta red blood cells. non-metabolizable analogue (3-O-methyl glucose L-glucose) uptake experiments concluded counterpart membrane transport system glucose found mammalian red blood cells. within cells, glucose directed CO2 lactate formation Embden-Meyerhoff hexose monophosphate shunts; lactate appears important end-product glucose metabolism cells. experiments anaerobic conditions, presence inhibitor pyruvate transfer mitochondria, CO2 formed appears derive hexose monophosphate pathway. Appreciable O2 consumption detected, clear relationship substrate metabolism. Key enzymes glucose metabolism, hexokinase, fructose-6-phosphate kinase and, probably, pyruvate kinase equilibrium, confirming regulatory activity Salmo trutta red blood cells. presence isoproterenol, catecholamine analogue, induces important changes glucose metabolism aerobic anaerobic conditions, increases production CO2 lactate. data presented, glucose appears major fuel Salmo trutta red blood cells, showing slightly different pattern glucose metabolism rainbow trout red blood cells.
