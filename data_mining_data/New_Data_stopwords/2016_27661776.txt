 accelerated growth solid tumors leads episodes hypoxia hypoglycemia (HH) affecting intermediary metabolism, signal transduction, transcriptional activity. previous study showed normoxia (20% O2 ) plus 24 h hypoglycemia (2.5 mM glucose) increased glycolytic flux whereas oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) unchanged versus normoglycemia HeLa cells. However, simultaneous effect HH energy metabolism yet examined. Therefore, effect hypoxia (0.1-1% O2 ) plus hypoglycemia energy metabolism HeLa cells analyzed evaluating protein content activity, along fluxes glycolysis OxPhos. hypoxia, cell growth ceased OxPhos enzyme activities, DeltaPsim flux depressed, hypoglycemia stimulate glycolytic flux despite increasing H-RAS, p-AMPK, GLUT1, GLUT3, HKI levels, decreasing mitochondrial enzyme content. impaired mitochondrial function HH cells correlated mitophagy activation. depressed OxPhos unchanged glycolysis pattern also observed quiescent cells mature multicellular tumor spheroids, suggesting inner cell layers similarly subjected HH. principal ATP supplier glycolysis HH 2D monolayer 3D quiescent spheroid cells. Accordingly, glycolytic inhibitors iodoacetate gossypol effective mitochondrial inhibitors decreasing HH-cancer cell viability. HH, stem cell-, angiogenic-, EMT-biomarkers, well glycoprotein-P content invasiveness, also enhanced. observations indicate HH cancer cells develop attenuated Warburg pronounced EMT- invasive-phenotype.
