 gene (gckA) responsible activity glycerate kinase identified within chromosomal fragment serine cycle methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. mutation gckA leads specific C1-negative phenotype. polypeptide sequence derived gckA showed high similarity product ttuD essential tartrate metabolism Agrobacterium vitis. data suggest gckA ttuD might structural genes glycerate kinase serine cycle tartrate utilization pathway share series reactions.
