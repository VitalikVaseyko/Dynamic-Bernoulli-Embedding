 principles main features enzymatic methods measurement sodium, potassium, chloride reviewed performance compared current procedures. method makes use relatively specific enzyme, catalysing reaction whose rate sensitive ion determined. (S)0.5 enzyme ion much lower assay concentration, ion concentration may reduced binding agent. Alternatively, competitive inhibitor may used raise (S)0.5 enzyme. case chloride determination amylase (S)0.5 enzyme raised limiting concentration free calcium. measurement potassium, interfering ions sodium removed binding Kryptofix 221 improvement performance also achieved use bacterial pyruvate kinase less sensitive sodium. enzymatic methods applicable measurement sodium, potassium chloride blood urine good precision, accuracy, specificity. used mechanized manual instruments. appears minimal interferences compounds found normal pathological serum urine.
