 Many cancers deficient catalase activity, maintain moderate level oxidative stress aid proliferation survival. may prove feasible achieve substantial selective tumor kill three-pronged strategy acutely exacerbating oxidative stress cancer cells: inducing increased production oxidants tumors sustained high-dose infusions sodium ascorbate menadione, concurrently undercutting antioxidant defenses cancer cells imposing glucose deprivation - 2-deoxyglucose administration hypoglycemic insulin clamp - suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activity available agents salicylate, rapamycin, irinotecan. Inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase-1 dichloroacetate may also promote oxidative stress hypoxic cancer cells. Cell culture studies could employed devise effective protocols could tested xenografted rodents and, ultimately, exploratory clinical trials.
