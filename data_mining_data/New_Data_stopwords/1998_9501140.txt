 vivo pyruvate synthesis malic enzyme (ME) pyruvate kinase vivo malate synthesis phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase Krebs cycle measured 13C incorporation [1-13C]glucose glucose-6-phosphate, alanine, glutamate, aspartate, malate. metabolites isolated maize (Zea mays L.) root tips aerobic hypoxic conditions. 13C-Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy gas chromatography-mass spectrometry used discern positional isotopic distribution within metabolite. information applied simple precursor-product model enabled calculation specific metabolic fluxes. respiring root tips, found contribute approximately 3% pyruvate synthesized, whereas pyruvate kinase contributed balance. activity increased greater 6-fold early hypoxia, declined coincident depletion cytosolic malate aspartate. found respiring root tips, anaplerotic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity high relative ME, therefore limit synthesis pyruvate ME. significance vivo pyruvate synthesis discussed respect malate pyruvate utilization isolated mitochondria intracellular pH regulation hypoxia.
