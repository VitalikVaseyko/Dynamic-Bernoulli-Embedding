 understanding dynamics biochemical networks vivo, terms properties components determined vitro, require latter determined conditions? vivo-like assay medium enzyme activity determination designed based concentrations major ionic constituents Escherichia coli cytosol: K(+), Na(+), Mg(2+), phosphate, glutamate, sulfate Cl(-). maximum capacities (V(max)) extracted enzymes two pathways determined using vivo-like assay medium assay medium specific enzyme. enzyme activities differed two assay conditions. differences could attributed unsuspected, pleiotropic effects K(+) phosphate. K(+) activated enzymes (aldolase, enolase glutamate dehydrogenase) inhibited others (phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase), whereas phosphate inhibited glycolytic enzymes glutamine synthetase activated glutamine 2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase. Neither high glutamate concentration, macromolecular crowding affected glycolytic nitrogen assimilation enzymes, product inhibition glutamate dehydrogenase glutamate. strategy assessing pathway enzymes kinetically conditions may necessary avoid inadvertent differences vivo vitro biochemistry. may also serve reveal otherwise unnoticed pleiotropic regulation, demonstrated present study K(+) phosphate.
