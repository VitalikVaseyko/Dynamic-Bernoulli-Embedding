 Metabolic reprogramming cancer cells recently recognized essential hallmark neoplasia. context, metabolic alterations represent attractive therapeutic target, encouraging results drugs targeting various metabolic processes obtained preclinical studies. Recently, several studies suggested dichloroacetate (DCA), specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, may potential anticancer drug large number diverse tumors. However, precise mechanism fully understood, important use DCA cancer treatment. present study, found DCA sensitized MCF7 breast cancer cells tamoxifen-induced cell death decreasing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. downregulation EGFR caused degradation protein. Furthermore, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase played important role DCA/tamoxifen-induced EGFR degradation. Finally, DCA also promoted comparable tamoxifen-induced cell death tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells, established long-term treatment tamoxifen. summary, results suggest DCA attractive potential drug sensitizes cells tamoxifen-induced cell death overcome tamoxifen resistance via downregulation EGFR expression breast cancer cells.
