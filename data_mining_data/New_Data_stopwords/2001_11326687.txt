 pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK known associated metabolic shift characteristic tumor cells. Meanwhile, universal expression isoenzyme basis detection various tumor diseases human clinical diagnosis. enzymes known essential tumor specific metabolic shift rat chemical carcinogenesis NADP-dependent enzymes malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. evaluate role enzymes human carcinogenesis, compared enzymatic activities normal colon mucosa tissues derived primary colon tumors. Histochemical staining showed enzyme activities restricted mucosal colon cells colon cancer cells. enzymes strongly heterogeneously expressed tumor tissues, whereas staining normal mucosa weak. Tumor M2-PK showed prominent differences normal colon mucosa colon cancer cells.
