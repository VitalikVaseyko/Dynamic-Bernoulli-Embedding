 UNLABELLED: Chronic Hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension (CH-PHT) characterized pulmonary artery (PA) vasoconstriction cell proliferation/hypertrophy. PA smooth muscle cell (PASMC) contractility proliferation controlled cytosolic Ca++ levels, largely determined membrane potential (E(M)). E(M) depolarized CH-PHT due decreased expression functional inhibition several redox-regulated, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) sensitive, voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv1.5 Kv2.1). Humans Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) also decreased PASMC expression Kv1.5 Kv2.1. speculate "K+-channelopathy" contributes PASMC depolarization Ca++ overload thus promoting vasoconstriction PASMC proliferation. hypothesized restoration Kv channel expression PHT might eventually beneficial. METHODS: Two strategies used increase Kv channel expression PASMCs: oral administration metabolic modulator drug (Dichloroacetate, DCA) direct Kv gene transfer using adenovirus (Ad5-Kv2.1). DCA pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, promotes oxidized redox state mimicking normoxia previously noted increase K+ current myocytes. Rats given DCA drinking water development CH-PHT hemodynamics measured approximately 5 days later. also tested ability Ad5-Kv2.1 increase Kv2.1 channel expression function human PAs ex vivo. RESULTS: DCA-treated rats decreased PVR, RVH PA remodeling compared control CH-PHT rats (n=5/group, p<0.05). DCA restored Kv2.1 expression PASMC Kv current density near normoxic levels. Adenoviral gene transfer increased expression Kv2.1 channels enhanced 4-AP constriction human PAs. CONCLUSION: Increasing Kv channel function PAs feasible might beneficial.
