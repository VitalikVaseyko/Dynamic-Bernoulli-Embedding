 Exposure organochlorinated pesticides dieldrin linked Parkinson's Alzheimer's diseases, endocrine disruption, cancer, cellular molecular mechanisms toxicity behind effects remain largely unknown. demonstrate, using functional genomics approach model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dieldrin alters leucine availability. model supported multiple lines congruent evidence: (1) mutants defective amino acid signaling transport sensitive dieldrin, reversed addition exogenous leucine; (2) dieldrin sensitivity wild-type mutant strains dependent upon leucine concentration media; (3) overexpression proteins increase intracellular leucine confer resistance dieldrin; (4) leucine uptake inhibited presence dieldrin; (5) dieldrin induces amino acid starvation response. Additionally, demonstrate appropriate negative regulation Ras/protein kinase pathway, along intact pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, required dieldrin tolerance. Many yeast genes described study human orthologs may modulate dieldrin toxicity humans.
