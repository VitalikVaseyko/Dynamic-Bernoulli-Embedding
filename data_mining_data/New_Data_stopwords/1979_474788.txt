 physiologically biochemically realistic model regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) constructed perfused rat heart. includes conversion inactive (phospho) active (dephospho) forms specific protein kinase (PDHK) phosphoprotein phosphatase (PDHP). activity tightly bound PDHK influenced synergistic activation/inhibition acetyl CoA/CoASH NADH/NAD. PDHK simulation sensitive fraction ADP Mg2+-chelated ATP-to-ADP ratio. Ca2+ stimulates binding Mg2+-dependent PDHP complex; bound enzyme considered active species. fraction PDH active form, rather substrate inhibitor levels, determines PDH activity conditions. fraction depends present value recent history difference PDHK PDHP activities. active continuously continuously control PDH.
