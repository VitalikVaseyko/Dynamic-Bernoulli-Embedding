 Nature uses carotenoids retinoids chromophores diverse energy conversion processes. key structural feature enabling interaction light manifestations electro-magnetism conjugated double-bond system members superfamily share common. Among retinoids, retinaldehyde alone long known active chromophore vision vertebrates invertebrates, well various light-driven proton ion pumps Archaea. now, vitamin (retinol) solely regarded biochemical precursor bioactive retinoids retinaldehyde retinoic acid (RA), recent results indicate compound physiology. functions electron carrier mitochondria. electronically coupling protein kinase Cdelta (PCKdelta) cytochrome c, vitamin enables redox activation enzyme. review focuses biochemistry biology PCKdelta signaling system, comprising PKCdelta, adapter protein p66Shc, cytochrome c retinol. complex positively regulates conversion pyruvate acetyl-coenzyme (CoA) pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme. Vitamin therefore plays key role glycolytic energy generation. emerging paradigm retinol electron-transfer agent potentially transformative, opening new frontiers retinoid research.
