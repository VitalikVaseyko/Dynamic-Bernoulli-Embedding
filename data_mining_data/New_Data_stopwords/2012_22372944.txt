 global proteomic responses foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes strain Scott A, active growth transition stationary growth phase progressively acidic conditions, created addition lactic acid HCl, investigated using label-free liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Approximately 56% Scott proteome quantitatively assessable, data provides insight acquired acid tolerance response (ATR) well relation ATR growth phase transition. Alterations protein abundance due acid stress focused proteins belonging L. monocytogenes common genome, strain-dependent proteins involved. However, one two complete prophage genomes appeared enter lysogeny. progressive acidification, growth rate yield reduced 55% 98%, respectively, comparison nonacidified control cultures. maintenance growth rate determined connected activation cytoplasmic pH homeostatic mechanisms cellular reproductive-related cell component turnover proteins markedly abundant acid stressed cultures. Cell biomass accumulation impeded predominantly due repression phosphodonor-linked enzymes involved sugar phosphotransfer, glycolysis, cell wall polymer biosynthesis. Acidification caused shift heterofermentation oxidatively stressed state ATP appears generated mainly pyruvate dehydrogenase/pyruvate oxidase/phosphotransacetylase/acetate kinase branched chain acid dehydrogenase pathways. Analysis regulons indicated energy conservation occurs due repression GTP/isoleucine sensor CodY also RelA mediated stringent response. Whole proteome analysis proved effective way highlight proteins involved acquisition ATR.
