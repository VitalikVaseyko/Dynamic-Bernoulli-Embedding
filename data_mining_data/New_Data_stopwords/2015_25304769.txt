 BACKGROUND: well-known elevated amounts nitric oxide reactive nitrogen species (RNS) impact negatively tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidative phosphorylation. perturbations severely compromise O2-dependent energy production. bacteria known adapt RNS, key tool employed macrophages combat infections, exact mechanisms unknown. METHODS: bacterium cultured defined mineral medium cell-free extracts obtained growth phase utilized various biochemical studies Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed in-gel activity assays, high performance liquid chromatography co-immunoprecipitaton applied investigate effects RNS model microbe Pseudomonas fluorescens. RESULTS: Citrate channeled away tricarboxylic acid cycle using novel metabolon consisting citrate lyase (CL), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). metabolic engine comprising three disparate enzymes appears transiently assemble supercomplex aimed ATP synthesis. up-regulation activities adenylate kinase (AK) nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) ensured efficacy ATP-making machine. CONCLUSION: Microbes may escape effects nitrosative stress re-engineering metabolic networks order generate store ATP anaerobically electron transport chain defective. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: molecular configuration described herein provides understanding metabolism plays key role adaptation nitrosative stress reveals novel targets inform development antimicrobial agents counter RNS-resistant pathogens.
