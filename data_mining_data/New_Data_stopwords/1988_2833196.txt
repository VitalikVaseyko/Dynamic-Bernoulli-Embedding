 enzymatic activities glycolytic hexose monophosphate pathways Candida parapsilosis, yeast lacking alcohol dehydrogenase able grow high glucose concentrations, compared Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cells grown either 8% glucose 2% glycerol activities measured optimal conditions. Results follows: glycolytic enzymes C. parapsilosis, except glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, exhibited activity weaker S. cerevisiae, especially yeasts grown glycerol. Fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase, enzyme implicated gluconeogenesis hexose monophosphate pathway, known sensitive catabolite repression S. cerevisiae, always active C. parapsilosis even cells grown 8% glucose. However, allosteric properties towards AMP fructose-2,6-bisphosphate strains. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, two enzymes hexose monophosphate pathway, exhibited higher activity C. parapsilosis S. cerevisiae. Regulation two important control points glycolytic flux, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, investigated. C. parapsilosis phosphofructokinase poorly sensitive ATP fructose-2,6-bisphosphate completely relieved light ATP inhibition. Pyruvate kinase require fructose-1,6-bisphosphate activity, way, regulate glycolytic flux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
