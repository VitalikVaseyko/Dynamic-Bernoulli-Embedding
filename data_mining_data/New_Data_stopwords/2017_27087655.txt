 BACKGROUND: aerobic glycolysis tumor cells known Warburg effect one important hallmarks cancer. proposed upregulation series metabolic enzymes along glycolytic pathway may contribute Warburg effect. OBJECTIVES: inhibition glycolytic enzymes found novel strategy anticancer treatment. review summaries recent patents development small molecule inhibitors key enzymes tumor glycolysis. targeted enzymes GLUTs, HKs, PFK, PGAM1, PKM2, LDHA, MCTs PDK. CONCLUSION: Although inhibitors still preclinical phase, inhibition glycolytic enzymes represents promising approach anticancer treatment. future development could focused discovery new metabolic enzyme specifically expressed tumor cells.
