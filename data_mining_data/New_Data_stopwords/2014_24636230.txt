 3-Bromopyruvate (3BP) new, promising anticancer alkylating agent several notable functions. addition inhibiting key glycolysis enzymes including hexokinase II lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 3BP also selectively inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, angiogenesis, energy production cancer cells. Moreover, 3BP induces hydrogen peroxide generation cancer cells (oxidative stress effect) competes LDH substrates pyruvate lactate. one published human clinical study showing 3BP effective treating fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. LDH good measure tumor evaluation predicts outcome treatment better presence residual tumor mass. According Warburg effect, LDH responsible lactate synthesis, facilitates cancer cell survival, progression, aggressiveness, metastasis, angiogenesis. Lactate produced LDH activity fuels aerobic cell populations inside tumors via metabolic symbiosis. melanoma, deadly skin cancer, 3BP induced necrotic cell death sensitive cells, whereas high glutathione (GSH) content made melanoma cells resistant 3BP. Concurrent use GSH depletor 3BP killed resistant melanoma cells. Survival melanoma patients inversely associated high serum LDH levels, reported highly predictive melanoma treatment randomized clinical trials. Here, report 28-year-old man presented stage IV metastatic melanoma affecting back, left pleura, lung. disease caused total destruction left lung high serum LDH level (4,283 U/L). ethics committee approval written patient consent, patient received 3BP intravenous infusions (1-2.2 mg/kg), anticancer effect minimal indicated high serum LDH level. may due high tumor GSH content. combining oral paracetamol, depletes tumor GSH, 3BP treatment, serum LDH level dropped maximally. Although slow intravenous infusion 3BP appeared minimal cytotoxicity, anticancer efficacy via delivery method low. possibly due high tumor GSH content, increased concurrent use GSH depletor paracetamol. anticancer effectiveness 3BP less expected, combination paracetamol may needed sensitize cancer cells 3BP-induced effects.
