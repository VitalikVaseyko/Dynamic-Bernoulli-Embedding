 AKT signaling important maintaining normal physiology. Hyperactivation AKT signaling frequent cancer, maintains high oxidative state tumor microenvironment needed tumor adaptation. Therefore, antioxidants proposed exhibit anticancer properties interfering tumor microenvironment. Quercetin ubiquitous bioactive antioxidant rich vegetables beverages. present study aimed analyze cancer preventive property quercetin ascite cells Dalton's lymphoma-bearing mice. Protein level determined Western blotting. Nitric oxide (NO) level estimated spectrophotometrically using Griess reagent. Results show downregulation phosphorylation AKT PDK1 quercetin, consistent decreased phosphorylation downstream survival factors BAD, GSK-3beta, mTOR, IkBalpha. Further, quercetin attenuated levels angiogenic factor VEGF-A inflammatory enzymes COX-2 iNOS well levels, whereas increased levels phosphatase PTEN. Overall results suggest quercetin modulates AKT signaling leading attenuation cell survival, inflammation, angiogenesis lymphoma-bearing mice.
