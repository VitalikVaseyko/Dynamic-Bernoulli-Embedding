 specific activity hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase measured 41 smooth muscle cell tumors: 20 leiomyomas 21 cases leiomyosarcoma. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences specific activity normal smooth muscle tissue benign malignant tumors originating it. Quantification isozyme composition pyruvate kinase showed significant shift isozyme pattern towards K-type subunits leiomyosarcomas compared leiomyomas.
