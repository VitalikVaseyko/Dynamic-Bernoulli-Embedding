 Simplified methodology developed direct N-terminal amino acid microsequencing human liver hepatoma derived polypeptides, following micropreparative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). Utilization immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gel strips first dimension permitted protein loading 0.5-2.0 mg negligible diminution polypeptide resolution. Following 2-D separation electrotransfer polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes nearly 100 well resolved Ponceau stained polypeptides readily visualized, which, 32 adult liver S-9 72 HepG2 nuclear cytosolic polypeptides subjected N-terminal microsequencing. Twenty normal adult liver 54 HepG2 polypeptides yielded N-terminal sequence information, 17 19 polypeptides, respectively, exhibited high sequence homology previously identified proteins. initial yields proteins sequenced ranged 2-14 pmols yielded sequences 14-26 amino acid residues. Many adult liver HepG2 proteins contained inferred leader sequences since first sequenced residue several (20-30) residues methionine initiation site predicted cDNA adult liver. Quantitative comparison 60 well characterized hepatic proteins normal adult liver two nontransformed, Chang WRL-68, four human hepatoma derived cell lines, HepG2, Huh-7, FOCUS, SK-Hep, revealed high homogeneity protein expression qualitatively quantitatively whole cell lysate purified nuclear preparations. notable differences include previously characterized polypeptides: carbamoyl phosphate synthase, MER5 homologous protein, cytidylate kinase, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase well three N-terminally blocked polypeptides: 11 (63 kDa/pI 7.00), 56 (26/6.45) 59 (22/6.00) expressed similar levels normal adult liver tissue nontransformed, Chang WRL-68, cell lines expressed expressed greatly decreased levels tumor derived liver cell lines. Pyruvate carboxylase, superoxide dismutase, serotransferrin, liver fatty acid binding protein, 1-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) well three N-terminally blocked polypeptides: 9 (57/6.00), 53 (24/4.90) 63 (16/4.70) detected whole adult liver tissue cultured cell lines. Two additional polypeptides: U35, (27/6.05) 58 (22/5.70) yielded N-terminal partial amino acid sequences identified established protein databases. shown micropreparative IPG 2-D PAGE combination protein microsequencing provides convenient one step procedure rapidly obtain partial amino acid sequence information nearly 100 individual polypeptides directly single 2-D PAGE gel numerous applications wide variety biological model systems.
