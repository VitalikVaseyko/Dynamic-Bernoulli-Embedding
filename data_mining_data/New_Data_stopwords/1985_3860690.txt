 Effect hepatocarcinogenesis dietary sorbitan fatty acid ester (SorFAE), known cause decrease pyruvate kinase (PK) activity, studied rats fed diet containing 0.06% 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB) 6 weeks. incidence hyperplastic nodules and/or hepatocellular carcinomas rats fed 3'-Me-DAB diet alone 45.0% end 51 weeks, whereas incidence rats fed 3'-Me-DAB diet followed 5 10% SorFAE 0.1% phenobarbital (PB) diet 76.2, 90.5, 95.0%, respectively. incidences significantly higher compared group fed 3'-Me-DAB diet alone (P less .05). tumors observed rats fed 10% SorFAE diet alone. results show SorFAE enhancing effect hepatocarcinogenesis, although effect weak compared effective PB dose. results seem confirm assumption chemical causes decrease PK activity rat liver might promote hepatocarcinogenesis.
