 Calorie restriction increases longevity mammals yeasts mechanism remains unclear. study, role glutathione lifespan extension induced calorie restriction investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain deficient glutathione synthesis (gsh1). observed increase chronological lifespan calorie-restricted gsh1 mutant cells, compared WT (wild type) strain, associated reduction levels oxidative stress biomarkers. gsh1 strain showed increase cell yield calorie restriction associated higher pyruvate kinase activity reduction oxygen consumption aconitase activity. indicates respiratory metabolism decreased gsh1 mutant cells. lifespan extension gsh1 mutant cells represent advantage long term, since old cells gsh1 strain showed higher frequency petite mutants. addition, aged WT cells outlast aged gsh1 mutant cells direct competition assays fresh medium. results suggest glutathione required beneficial effects calorie restriction cellular longevity.
