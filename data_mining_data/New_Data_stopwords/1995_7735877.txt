 Defects mitochondrial respiratory chain associated great variety clinical disorders. Whilst recognition conditions increasing, need sophisticated biochemical molecular studies tended limit investigation diagnosis specialist centres. Using group 51 patients histochemically, biochemically and/or genetically defined respiratory chain defects, examined clinical heterogeneity disorders may investigated effectively non-specialist centres. evaluated use following routinely available clinical investigations--fasting intermediary metabolites (lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies, etc.) blood cerebrospinal fluid, serum creatine kinase estimation, EMG, EEG, CT, MRI histological/histochemical muscle biopsy analysis. studies show that, addition well-recognized syndromes (e.g. chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis stroke like episodes, myoclonus epilepsy ragged red-fibres, significant number patients present non-specific encephalopathic disorders. Furthermore, even within categories respiratory chain disease genetically defined, wide variation presenting symptoms signs found. initial doubt concerning diagnosis, following clinical features helpful suggesting respiratory chain disease: ophthalmoplegia; maternal pattern inheritance; presence myopathy deafness association encephalopathy. clinical investigations assessed, elevated lactate blood cerebrospinal fluid low density lesions basal ganglia helpful identifying patients respiratory chain dysfunction. Histochemical analysis muscle was, however, single useful investigation diagnostic patients chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Kearns-Sayre syndrome myopathy, significant importance patients presenting primarily central nervous system disease. results study used discuss appropriate approach diagnosis group disorders.
