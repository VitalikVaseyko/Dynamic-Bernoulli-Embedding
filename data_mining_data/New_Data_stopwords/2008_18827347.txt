 determine antioxidant role glutathione (GSH) human red blood cells (RBCs), investigated effect disrupting GSH homeostasis oxidative modification thiol-dependent enzymes exposure tert-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP). hemolysate incubated BHP, significant decreases enzyme activity observed. However, inactivation occur intact RBC suspensions exposed BHP. study, used two independent treatments aimed decreasing level reduced form GSH, pre-incubation glutathione reductase inhibitor glucose-free medium examine influences preventing GSH-dependent antioxidant reactivation activity thiol-dependent enzyme. Pyruvate kinase (PK) activity clearly decreased along depletion GSH compared glycolytic enzyme activities BHP exposure RBCs. addition GSH, glucose, BHP exposure completely prevented inactivation PK hemolysate; however, partial reactivation inactivated PK observed post-addition GSH glutaredoxin early stage BHP exposure. Moreover, hydroxyl radicals hydrogen peroxide inactivated PK. results suggest PK highly susceptible radicals GSH essential protect PK activity directly scavenging radicals also systematically reactivating oxidized enzyme human RBCs.
