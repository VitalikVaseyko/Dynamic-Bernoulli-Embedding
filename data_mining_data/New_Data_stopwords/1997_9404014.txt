 establish skeletal muscle profile elite sprinters, obtained muscle biopsy samples vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius soleus African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Muscle ultrastructure characterized fiber type composition mitochondrial volume density sample. Maximum enzyme activity, myoglobin content mixed fiber metabolite content used assess major biochemical pathways. results demonstrate preponderance fast-twitch fibers locomotor muscles cheetahs; 83% total number fibers examined vastus lateralis nearly 61% gastrocnemius comprised fast-twitch fibers. total mitochondrial volume density limb muscles ranged 2.0 3.9% two wild cheetahs. Enzyme activities reflected sprinting capability cheetah. Maximum activities pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase vastus lateralis 1519.00 +/- 203.60 1929.25 +/- 482.35 mumol min-1.g wet wt-1, respectively, indicated high capacity glycolysis. study demonstrates locomotor muscles cheetahs poised anaerobically based exercise. Fiber type composition, mitochondrial content glycolytic enzyme capacities locomotor muscles sprinting cats extreme range values sprinters bred trained activity including greyhounds, thoroughbred horses elite human athletes.
