 Warburg effect first described Otto Warburg 1920s describes preferential conversion glucose lactate opposed metabolism citric acid cycle fuel oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria, even presence oxygen. phenotype common feature malignant cells also observed highly proliferative normal tissues. selective advantage provided phenotype entirely clear. Adopting metabolic state may allow tumor cells balance need ATP, biosynthetic precursor molecules, reducing power order respond growth proliferation signals may provide selective advantage hypoxic acidic microenvironments often feature solid tumors. Oncogenic signaling pathways responses local microenvironment combine produce metabolic phenotype via number molecular mechanisms. better understanding mechanisms tumor normal tissues complete understanding Warburg effect interacts rest tumor metabolic network provide opportunities novel clinical intervention.
