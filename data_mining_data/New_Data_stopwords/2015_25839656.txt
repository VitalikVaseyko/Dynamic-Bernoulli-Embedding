 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) characterized constitutive up-regulation hypoxia inducible factor-1. One target enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 1 (PDHK1) showed increased protein expression tumor compared patient-matched normal tissues. PDHK1 phosphorylated inhibited PDH whose enzymatic activity severely diminished, depriving TCA cycle acetylCoA. others shown decrease protein expressions respiratory complexes alluding compromise oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). contrary, found key parameters OXPHOS, namely ATP biosynthesis membrane potential consistently measurable mitochondria isolated ccRCC tumor tissues. Interestingly, endogenous mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) evident ADP added mitochondria isolated ccRCC normal tissues. addition, MMP elicited presence ADP respiratory substrates namely malate/glutamate, succinate, alpha-ketoglutarate isocitrate invariably higher ccRCC. Two additional hallmarks ccRCC include loss uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 increase UCP-3. Based data, proposed inhibition UCP3 ADP could contribute endogenous MMP observed ccRCC cancer cells.
