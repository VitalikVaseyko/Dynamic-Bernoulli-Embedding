 Enzymes associated glycogen metabolism glycerol synthesis larvae Shonai ecotype rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, investigated winter 2000-2001. Glycerol content scarcely detected September October, rapidly increased November December, peaked January, decreased. Glycogen converted glycerol winter February, glycerol reconverted glycogen March. trehalose content remained constant winter. activities enzymes associated glycerol synthesis changed season. Glycerol accumulation accomplished activation glycogen phosphorylase, inhibition fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase pyruvate kinase, activation enzymes associated glycerol synthesis, mainly glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatase polyol dehydrogenase glyceraldehyde activity. changes led diversion triose phosphates pathway glycerol synthesis. However, activities two initial enzymes hexose monophosphate shunt activated remained relatively constant, high period active glycerol synthesis. decreasing temperature field transition diapause post-diapause state may responsible changes activities enzymes associated glycerol synthesis.
