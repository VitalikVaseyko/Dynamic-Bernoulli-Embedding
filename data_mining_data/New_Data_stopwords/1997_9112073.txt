 Female albino rats exposed methadone 35-day period addition drug drinking water. final dose drug 1.8 mg/kg body weight per day. period, drug withdrawn animals 30 days (postexposure). Compared unexposed controls, serum glucose levels rose exposure returned control levels postexposure. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed impairment 35-day drug-exposed animals compared controls postexposure. activities three key enzymes glycolysis three key enzymes gluconeogenesis measured liver end exposure period, well postexposure. Compared unexposed controls postexposure, specific activities two glycolytic enzymes livers exposed animals-hexokinase phosphofructokinase 1-were significantly reduced, whereas activity third glycolytic enzyme-pyruvate kinase-was unchanged. specific activities two gluconeogenic enzymes-glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1,6-biphosphatase-were significantly elevated drug-exposed animals compared controls, whereas activity third enzyme-phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-was unchanged. data indicate methadone addiction produces metabolic state similar insulin-resistant diabetes.
