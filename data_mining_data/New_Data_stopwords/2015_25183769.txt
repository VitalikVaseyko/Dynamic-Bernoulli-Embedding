 Microbial infections induce aberrant responses cellular stress pathways, leading translational attenuation, metabolic restriction, activation oxidative stress, detrimental effects cell survival. show infection human airway epithelial cells Streptococcus pneumoniae leads induction endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidative stress, activation mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, regulation respective target genes. identify pneumococcal H2O2 causative agent responses, catalase-treated pyruvate oxidase-deficient bacteria lacked activities. Pneumococcal H2O2 induced nuclear NF-kappaB translocation transcription proinflammatory cytokines. Inhibition translational arrest ER stress salubrinal MAPK signaling pathways attenuate cytokine transcription. results provide strong evidence notion inhibition translation important host pathway monitoring harmful pathogen-associated activities, thereby enabling differentiation pathogenic nonpathogenic bacteria.
