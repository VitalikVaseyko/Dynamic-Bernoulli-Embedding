 studied effects insulin several aspects cell metabolism insulin-sensitive, nonfusing muscle cell line BC3H-1. absence exogenous hexose, insulin alter basal glycogen synthase percentage activity, attenuate increase intracellular cAMP content, activation glycogen phosphorylase a, decrease glycogen synthase brought beta-adrenergic receptor activation epinephrine. contrast, insulin tumor-promoting phorbol ester, tetradecanoylyl phorbol acetate markedly increased mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity absence hexose. glycogen synthase phosphatase glycogen synthase kinase activities present BC3H-1 cell extracts regulated expected manner glucose 6-phosphate cAMP, respectively. Since pattern partial insulin resistance seen BC3H-1 myocytes would require several potentially insulin-sensitive enzymes insensitive insulin-generated signals, likely explanation data myocytes defective mechanism insulin signaling independent mechanism pyruvate dehydrogenase activation.
