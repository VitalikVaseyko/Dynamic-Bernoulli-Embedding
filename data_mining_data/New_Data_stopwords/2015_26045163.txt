 Activation macrophages dendritic cells (DCs) pro-inflammatory stimuli causes undergo metabolic switch towards glycolysis away oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), similar Warburg effect tumors. However, recently mechanisms responsible metabolic reprogramming elucidated detail. transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) plays important role conditions hypoxia normoxia. withdrawal citrate tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle shown critical lipid biosynthesis macrophages DCs. Interference process actually abolishes ability DCs activate cells. Another TCA cycle intermediate, succinate, activates HIF-1alpha promotes inflammatory gene expression. new insights providing us deeper understanding role metabolic reprogramming innate immunity.
