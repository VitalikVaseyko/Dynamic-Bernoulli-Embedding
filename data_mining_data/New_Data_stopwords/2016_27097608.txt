 One cancer molecular hallmarks deviant energetic metabolism, known Warburg effect, whereby rate glucose uptake significantly increased high rate glycolysis lactic acid production occurs even oxygen present-"aerobic lactatogenesis". Accordingly, GLUT1 MCT1, main glucose lactate transporters cancer cells, respectively, proposed oncogenes currently seen potential therapeutic targets cancer treatment. Polyphenols, commonly contained fruits vegetables, long associated protective role cancer. Generally considered nontoxic, dietary polyphenols considered ideal chemopreventive possibly chemotherapeutic agents. Several mechanisms action polyphenols breast cancer cells proposed including modulation intracellular signaling, induction apoptosis redox regulation modulation epigenetic alterations. Additionally, vitro studies shown several polyphenols act specific inhibitors glucose transport breast cancer cell lines association anticarcinogenic effect inhibition glucose cellular uptake described. Also, polyphenols found inhibit lactate transport. Importantly, polyphenols behave inhibitors glucose lactate cellular uptake breast cancer cells compounds thus interesting context chemopreventive effect, deplete breast cancer cells two important energy suppliers. So, antimetabolic effect polyphenols regarded mechanism action contributing chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic potential relation breast cancer.
