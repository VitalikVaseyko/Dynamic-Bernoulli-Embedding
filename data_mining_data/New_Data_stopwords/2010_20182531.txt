 Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) lethal gynecologic cancer also one poorly understood. health issues affecting women increasing frequency obesity diabetes, associated dysglycemia increased blood glucose. Warburg Effect describes ability fast-growing cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose via anaerobic glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation. Recent epidemiological studies suggested role hyperglycemia pathogenesis number cancers. hyperglycemia contributes tumour growth progression, intuitive antihyperglycemic drugs may also important antitumour role. Preliminary reports suggest drugs reduce available plasma glucose, also direct effects cancer cell viability modification molecular energy-sensing pathways. review investigates effect hyperglycemia may EOC potential antihyperglycemic drugs therapeutic adjuncts.
