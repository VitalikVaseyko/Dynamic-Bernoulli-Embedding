 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency common cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. prevalence deficiency unknown, though estimates made based frequency low red cell PK activity population. additional 20 patients hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia caused PK deficiency genotyped. One previously unreported mutation 1153C-->T (R385W) encountered. relative frequency PK mutations patients hemolytic anemia caused PK deficiency calculated 18 white patients reported 102 patients previously reported literature. DNA samples 3785 subjects different ethnic groups screened 4 frequently encountered mutations-c.1456 C-->T(1456T), c.1468 C-->T(1468T), c.1484 C-->T(1484T), c.1529 G6A (1529A)-by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Among white patients frequency 1456T mutation 3.50 x 10(-3); 1529A mutation 2.03 x 10(-3). Among African Americans frequency 1456T mutation 3.90 x 10(-3) mutation found limited number Asians tested 1468T frequency 7.94 x 10(-3). Based gene frequency 1529A mutation white population relative abundance patients hemolytic anemia caused PK deficiency, prevalence PK deficiency estimated 51 cases per million white population. number would increased inbreeding decreased failure patients PK deficiency survive.
