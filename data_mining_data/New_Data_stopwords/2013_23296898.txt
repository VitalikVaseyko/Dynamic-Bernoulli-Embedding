 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells commonly used industrial production recombinant proteins fed batch alternative production systems. Cells progress multiple metabolic stages fed-batch antibody (mAb) production, including exponential growth phase accompanied lactate production, low growth, stationary phase specific mAb production increases, decline cell viability declines. Although media composition cell lineage shown impact growth productivity, little known metabolic changes molecular level. Better understanding cellular metabolism aid identifying targets genetic metabolic engineering optimize bioprocess cell engineering. studied high expressing recombinant CHO cell line, designated high performer (HP), fed-batch productions using stable isotope tracers biochemical methods determine changes central metabolism accompany growth mAb production. also compared contrasted results HP high lactate producing cell line exhibits poor growth productivity, designated low performer (LP), determine intrinsic metabolic profiles linked respective phenotypes. results reveal alternative metabolic regulatory pathways lactate TCA metabolite production reported literature. distribution key media components glycolysis, TCA cycle, lactate production, biosynthetic pathways shown shift dramatically exponential growth stationary (production) phases. determined glutamine utilized efficiently glucose anaplerotic replenishment contributes significantly lactate production exponential phase. Cells shifted glucose utilization TCA cycle growth rate decreased. magnitude metabolic switch important attaining high viable cell mass antibody titers. also found phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK1) pyruvate kinase (PK) subject differential regulation exponential stationary phases. concomitant shifts enzyme expression metabolite utilization profiles shed light regulatory links cell metabolism, media metabolites, cell growth.
