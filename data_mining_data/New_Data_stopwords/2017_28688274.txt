 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) rate-limiting enzyme glycolytic pathway highly expressed cancer cells. Cancer cells rely heavily PKM2 anabolic energy requirements, specific targeting PKM2 therefore potential strategy cancer therapy. Here, report synthesis biologic evaluation novel naphthoquinone derivatives selective small molecule inhibitors PKM2. target compounds, compound 3k, displayed potent PKM2 inhibitory activity reported optimal PKM2 inhibitor shikonin. well performing compound 3k also showed nanomolar antiproliferative activity toward series cancer cell lines high expression PKM2 including HCT116, Hela H1299 IC50 values ranging 0.18 1.56 muM. Moreover, compound 3k exhibited cytotoxicity cancer cells normal cells. identification novel potent small molecule inhibitors PKM2 offers candidate compounds cancer therapy, also provides tool evaluate function PKM2 depth.
