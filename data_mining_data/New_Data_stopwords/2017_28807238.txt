 Cancer induction highly complex process involving hundreds different inducers whose eventual outcome same. Clearly, essential understand signalling pathways networks generated inducers interact regulate cell behaviour create cancer phenotype. enormous strides made identifying key networking profiles, amount data generated far exceeds ability understand "fits together". number potential interactions astronomically large requires novel approaches extreme computation methods dissect out. However, methodologies high intrinsic mathematical conceptual content difficult follow. review explains computation modelling progressively finding solutions also revealing unexpected unpredictable nano-scale molecular behaviours extremely relevant signalling networking coherently integrated. divided linked sections illustrated numerous figures literature describing different approaches offering visual portrayals networking major conceptual advances field. First, problem signalling complexity data collection illustrated small selection known oncogenes. Next, new concepts biophysics, molecular behaviours, kinetics, organisation nano level predictive models presented. areas include: visual representations networking, Energy Landscapes energy transfer/dissemination (entropy); diffusion, percolation; molecular crowding; protein allostery; quinary structure fractal distributions; energy management, metabolism re-examination Warburg effect. importance unravelling complex network interactions illustrated widely-used drugs cancer therapy whose interactions extensive. Finally, use computational modelling develop micro- nano- functional models ("bottom-up" research) highlighted. review concludes computational modelling essential part cancer research vital understanding network formation molecular behaviours associated it. role increasingly essential unravelling huge complexity cancer induction otherwise unattainable approach.
