 Cell suspensions Bacteroides fragilis allowed ferment glucose lactate labeled (14)C different positions. fermentation products, propionate acetate, isolated, distribution radioactivity determined. analysis key enzymes possible pathways also made. results labeling experiments showed that: (i) B. fragilis ferments glucose via Embden-Meyerhof pathway; (ii) randomization carbons 1, 2, 6 glucose conversion propionate, accordance propionate formation via fumarate succinate. enzymes 6-phosphofrucktokinase (pyrophosphate-dependent), fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, methylmalonyl-coenzyme mutase could demonstrated cell extracts. presence supported labeling results suggested propionate formed succinate via succinyl-, methylmalonyl-, propionyl-coenzyme A. results also clear CO(2) necessary growth needed formation C4 acids. also randomization carbons 1, 2, 6 glucose conversion acetate, indicated pyruvate kinase played minor role pyruvate formation phosphoenolpyruvate. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, malic enzyme (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent) present cell extracts B. fragilis, results labeling experiments agreed pyruvate synthesis via oxaloacetate malate acids equilibrium fumarate. conversion [2-(14)C]- [3-(14)C]lactate acetate associated randomization radioactivity.
