 objective study examine impact municipal wastewater effluents functioning cortisol stress axis rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Juvenile rainbow trout caged upstream (reference) downstream (100% 10% effluent) tertiary-treated municipal wastewater treatment plant outfall sampled 14d later (0 time samples). second set fish subjected 5 min handling disturbance sampled 1 24h post-stressor exposure. Plasma cortisol, glucose lactate concentrations, liver brain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein levels, head kidney mRNA abundances corticosteroidogenesis genes, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc), 11beta-hydroxylase melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), key liver metabolic enzyme activities, measured. Exposure effluent 14d significantly elevated plasma cortisol lactate levels 100% effluent group compared reference 10% effluent sites. significantly higher StAR mRNA abundance effluent groups compared upstream control. GR protein levels liver, brain, significantly higher 100% effluent group compared upstream control group. Chronic exposure 100% effluent 14d significantly lowered liver hexokinase glucokinase activities, affect glycogen content activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase compared two groups. Subjecting fish secondary acute stressor elicited physiological stress response, including significant transient elevation plasma cortisol, glucose lactate levels 1h dropped pre-stress levels 24h stressor exposure, control 10% effluent groups, conserved stress response impaired 100% effluent group. 100% effluent group fish also significantly higher StAR P450scc mRNA abundances 1h post-stress, transcript abundances major corticosteroidogenesis genes suppressed 24h post-stressor compared control 10% effluent groups. Considered together, exposure full-strength MWWE 14d elicits chronic stress response rainbow trout, perturbs conserved adaptive response acute stressor. results reveal impact tertiary-treated MWWE stress performance rainbow trout abolished 90% effluent dilution.
