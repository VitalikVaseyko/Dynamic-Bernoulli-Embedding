 Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) establishes life-long latency peripheral neurons productive replication suppressed. periodic reactivation results virus production, molecular basis neuronal latency remains incompletely understood. Using primary neuronal culture system HSV-1 latency reactivation, show continuous signaling phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway triggered nerve growth factor (NGF)-binding TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) instrumental maintaining latent HSV-1. PI3-K p110alpha catalytic subunit, beta delta isoforms, specifically required activate 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) sustain latency. Disrupting pathway leads virus reactivation. EGF GDNF, two growth factors capable activating PI3-K PDK1 differ NGF ability persistently activate Akt, fully support HSV-1 latency. Thus, nature RTK signaling critical host parameter regulates HSV-1 latent-lytic switch.
