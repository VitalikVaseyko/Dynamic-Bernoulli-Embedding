 Sustenance cancer cells vivo critically depends variety genetic metabolic adaptations. Aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect defining biochemical hallmark transformed cells five decades although clear molecular basis observation emerging recent years. study, present findings thyroid hormone exerts non-genomic genomic actions two model human breast cancer cell lines differentially. laying clear foundation experimentally monitoring Warburg phenotype living cancer cells, demonstrate thyroid hormone-induced modulation bioenergetic profiles two model cell lines depends degree Warburg phenotype display. also show thyroid hormone sensitize mitochondria aggressive, triple-negative breast cancer cells favorably increase chemotherapeutic efficacy cells. Even though role thyroid hormone modulating mitochondrial metabolism known, current study accentuates critical role plays modulating Warburg phenotype breast cancer cells. clinical significance finding possibility devise strategies metabolically modulating aggressive triple-negative tumors enhance chemosensitivity vivo.
