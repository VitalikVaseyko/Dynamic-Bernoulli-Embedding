 activity glycolytic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase), content metabolites (lactate, pyruvate, ATP, 2,3-DPG) haemolytic stability rat erythrocytes action chronic X-irradiation daily dose 0.258 mC/kg, 2.58 mC/kg, 5.16 mC/kg 90, 60 30 days, accordingly, investigated. shown, glycolytic enzymes activity female rats different seasons may vary wide limits. general tendency decrease lactate dehydrogenase activity revealed, beginning effects irradiation daily dose 2.58 mC/kg 5.16 mC/kg may differently directed. analogous tendencies found change hexokinase activity. changes pyruvate kinase activity correlated erythrocytes haemolytic stability. data obtained prove changes direction glycolytic enzymes activity irradiation depend initial level, caused seasonal peculiarities physiological state.
