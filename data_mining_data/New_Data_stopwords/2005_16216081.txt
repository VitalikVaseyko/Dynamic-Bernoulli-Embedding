 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2) prototypical mitochondrial protein kinase regulates activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Recent structural studies established PDK2 consists catalytic core built B K domains relatively long amino carboxyl tails unknown function. Here, show carboxy-terminal truncation variants PDK2 display greatly diminished capacity phosphorylation holo-PDC. effect due largely inability transacetylase component PDC promote phosphorylation reaction catalyzed truncated PDK2 variants. Furthermore, truncated forms PDK2 bind poorly lipoyl-bearing domain(s) provided transacetylase component. Taken together, data strongly suggest carboxyl tails PDK isozymes contribute lipoyl-bearing domain-binding site kinase molecule. also show carboxyl tails derived isozymes PDK1, PDK3, PDK4 capable supporting kinase activity kinase core derived PDK2 well binding respective PDK2 chimeras lipoyl-bearing domain. Furthermore, chimera carrying carboxyl tail PDK3 displays stronger response addition transacetylase component along better binding lipoyl-bearing domain, suggesting that, least part, differences amino acid sequences carboxyl tails account differences PDK isozymes.
