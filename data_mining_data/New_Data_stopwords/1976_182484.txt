 Glucagon, epinephrine cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) prevented induction liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) refeeding glucose-casein mixture starved rats. prevention agents occurred without change amount diet consumed. injection cyclic AMP refeeding glucose-casein diet initiated simultaneously, inhibiton G6PD induction depending upon dose frequency cyclic AMP administration period refeeding, cyclic AMP given later 12 h refeeding, lag period induction enzyme, preventive effect. glucose prefeeding also found counteract inhibitory effect cyclic AMP G6PD induction subsequent glucose-casein refeeding. present data together elimination actinomycin effect glucose prefeeding suggest inhibitory effect cyclic AMP induction G6PD dehydrogenase exerted level transcription.
