 Death-associated protein kinase (DAPk), multi-domain serine/threonine kinase, regulates numerous cell death mechanisms harbors tumor suppressor functions. study, report DAPk directly binds functionally activates pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), key glycolytic enzyme, contributes regulation cancer cell metabolism. PKM2 identified novel binding partner DAPk yeast two-hybrid screen. interaction validated vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified proteins vivo co-immunoprecipitation two endogenous proteins cells. vitro interaction full-length DAPk resulted significant increase activity PKM2. Conversely, fragment DAPk harboring functional kinase domain (KD) could neither bind PKM2 cells activate vitro. Indeed, DAPk failed phosphorylate PKM2. Notably, transfection cells, truncated DAPk lacking KD, elevated endogenous PKM2 activity, suggesting PKM2 activation DAPk occurs independently kinase activity. DAPk-transfected cells displayed changes glycolytic activity, reflected elevated lactate production, whereas glucose uptake remained unaltered. mild reduction cell proliferation detected well transfected cells. Altogether, work identifies new role DAPk metabolic regulator, suggesting concept direct interactions tumor suppressor key glycolytic enzyme limit cell growth. Moreover, work documents unique function DAPk independent catalytic activity novel mechanism activate PKM2 protein-protein interaction.
