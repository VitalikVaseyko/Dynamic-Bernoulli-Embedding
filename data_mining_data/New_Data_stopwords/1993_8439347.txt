 Mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase binds lipoyl domain region core structure forming dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) subunits. bound kinase greatly enhanced rate phosphorylating E2-bound pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) tetramers versus rate resolved kinase phosphorylates dissociated E1. E2-activated kinase function completely prevented selective alkylation reduced lipoyl groups kinase E1 binding E2 core retained. Selective removal lipoyl cofactors intact E2 treatment Enterococcus faecalis lipoamidase decreased kinase activity 4-fold caused selective release major portion kinase E2 sucrose-step gradient procedure. Selective reversible modification lipoyl groups E2 subunits also allowed kinase dissociated mildly chaotropic conditions. Thus, lipoyl prosthetic group one two lipoyl domains E2 subunits critically important maintaining E2-activated kinase function contributes binding kinase E2. Since removal lipoyl group weakened kinase binding E2 modifying lipoyl thiols, suggested hydrophobic inner portion lipoyl conjugate (i.e., lysine carbons C1 C5 lipoic acid) important binding kinase.
