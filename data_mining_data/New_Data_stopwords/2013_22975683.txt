 phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (Pi3K)/Akt pathway major regulator cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, survival, angiogenesis. Despite extensive study, thorough understanding modulation regulation pathway remained elusive. previously demonstrated syndecan 4 (S4) regulates intracellular localization mTORC2, thus altering phosphorylation Akt serine473 (Ser473), one two critical phosphorylation sites essential full activation Akt [1]. report S4 also regulates phosphorylation Akt threonine308 (Thr308), second phosphorylation site required full Akt activation. deletion S4 resulted lower levels Thr308 phosphorylation vitro vivo. Furthermore, deletion knockdown S4 effector molecule PKCalpha led similar reduction phosphorylation Thr308 overexpression myristoylated PKCalpha rescued AktThr308 phosphorylation endothelial cells lacking S4. Finally, PAK1/2 also recruited rafts S4-PKCalpha complex required AKT activation.
