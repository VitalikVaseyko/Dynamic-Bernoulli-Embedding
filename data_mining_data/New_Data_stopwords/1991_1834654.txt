 11.5-kDa Zn(2+)-binding protein (ZnBP) covalently linked Sepharose. Affinity chromatography cytosolic subfraction liver resulted purification predominant 38-kDa protein. comparable experiments brain cytosol 39-kDa protein enriched. ZnBP-protein interactions zinc-specific. proteins identified fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. Experiments crude cytosol showed zinc-specific interaction additional enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism. liver cytosol greater 90% following enzymes specifically retained: aldolase, phosphofructokinase-1, hexokinase/glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase remained unbound. L-type pyruvate kinase phosphorylated form seems interact ZnBP. Using brain cytosol hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, aldolase completely bound affinity column, whereas glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, triose-phosphate isomerase remained unbound. behavior glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase tissue could followed. possible function ZnBP supramolecular organization carbohydrate metabolism proposed.
