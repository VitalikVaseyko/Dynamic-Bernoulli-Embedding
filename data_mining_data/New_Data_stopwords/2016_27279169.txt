 Levels intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) significantly increased hemocytes collected WSSV-infected shrimp within first 30-120 min infection. Measurement NADPH/NADP(+) GSH/GSSG ratios revealed significant imbalance toward oxidized forms 2 hpi, redox equilibrium subsequently restored. Meanwhile, high levels lactic acid production, elevated NADH/NAD(+) ratios, metabolic changes glycolysis pathway show Warburg effect triggered virus. timing changes suggests WSSV uses metabolic shift aerobic glycolysis counteract high levels ROS produced response viral infection. show Warburg effect inhibited chemical inhibition PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, pentose phosphate pathway chemically inhibited, cases, production intracellular ROS sustained. conclude WSSV uses PI3K-Akt-mTOR-regulated Warburg effect restore host redox balance counter ROS produced host response WSSV infection. also found pyruvate kinase activity inhibited WSSV. inhibition likely increase availability raw materials essential WSSV gene expression replication.
