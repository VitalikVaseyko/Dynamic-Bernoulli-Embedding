 Hematological data activities 21 red cell enzymes measured 8 nonpregnant ewes, 13 chronically catheterized fetuses 125-135 days gestation, 8 mothers. addition, 7 lambs followed birth 17 days age. Fetal sheep red cells dramatically increased activities 17 21 enzymes measured compared adult nonpregnant ewes. pattern decline enzyme activities development varies considerably among enzymes. activity seven enzymes showed orderly decline fetal adult life. seven enzymes little decline activity observed 125 135 days gestation birth. Pyruvate kinase activity declined adult levels birth. Phosphoglucose isomerase nucleoside phosphorylase activity increased, glutathione peroxidase activity decreased newborn lamb red cells compared fetal cells. Differences blood cell variables also found among groups.
