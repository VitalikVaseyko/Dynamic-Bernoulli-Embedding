 effect ischemia concentration active pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex investigated glucose-perfused hearts normal rats fed normal diet high-fat diet starved 48 hr hearts alloxan-diabetic rats. Global ischemia induced low flow (approximately equal 1 ml/min) lowered concentration active complex conditions employed. Parallel studies effect anoxia potassium arrest heart indicated effect low-flow ischemia may result decreased mechanical activity heart consequence tissue hypoxia; enzymatic mechanism may activation PDH kinase increased reduction mitochondrial NAD. hearts normal rats fed normal diet, global ischemia induced zero flow increased concentration active complex. Evidence given may result combination anoxia acidosis. aerobic perfusions, concentrations active complex ranked order: normal diet greater high-fat diet greater 48-hr starved greater alloxan-diabetic. order maintained concentration active complex lowered global ischemia induced zero flow.
