 microenvironmental manipulation glutathione (GSH) improving cold resistance Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451(T) investigated study. proved GSH relieves metabolic disorder cells cold stress, prevents decreased activities related key enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) upon cold challenges. Higher intracellular ATP level also found cells GSH cold stress. Moreover, cells imported GSH significantly higher intracellular control cold treatment. addition, proteomics analysis showed exciting findings protective function GSH cold stress related metabolic regulation multi-control induced cross-stresses. results broaden knowledge physiological function GSH, suggest practicable approach improve cold resistance L. sanfranciscensis, starter culture sourdough, addition GSH.
