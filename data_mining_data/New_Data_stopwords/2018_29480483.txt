 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) intracellular master energy sensor metabolic regulator. AMPK involved cell energy homeostasis regulation glycolytic flux mitochondrial biogenesis. Interestingly, metabolic dysfunctions AMPK deregulations observed many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's. deregulations could play key role development diseases, study metabolic fluxes remained quite challenging time-consuming. chapter, describe Seahorse XFe respirometry assay fundamental experimental tool investigate role AMPK controlling modulating cell metabolic fluxes living intact differentiated primary neurons. Seahorse XFe respirometry assay allows real-time monitoring glycolytic flux mitochondrial respiration different kind cells, tissues, isolated mitochondria. Here, specify protocol optimized primary neuronal cells using several energy substrates glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glutamine, ketone bodies. Nevertheless, protocol easily adapted monitor metabolic fluxes types cells, tissues, isolated mitochondria taking account notes proposed key step assay.
