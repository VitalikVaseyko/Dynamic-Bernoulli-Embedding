 Malnutrition foetal life induce modifications phenotype individual. present study aimed observe effects low foetal life protein provision modifications phenotype changes progeny 1-year-old female mink (F(1) generation) offspring mothers fed low-protein diet. Traits studied included reproductive performance, energy protein metabolism, key hepatic enzymes associated glucose homeostasis metabolic hormones. F(0) generation offspring fed either low-protein (14 % metabolisable energy (ME) protein - FLP1) adequate-protein (29 % protein - FAP1) diet last 17.9 (sd 3.6) gestation. F(1) dams studied birth 1 year age, first reproductive cycle, maintenance adequate diet birth thereafter. Metabolic traits gestation lactation largely unaffected foetal life protein provision, birth weight F(2) generation higher (P = 0.003) among FLP2 kits among FAP2 kits. Furthermore, relative abundance pyruvate kinase mRNA significantly (P = 0.007) lower, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA tended (P = 0.08) lower FLP2 foetuses FAP2 foetuses, showing similar difference F(2) generation F(1) generation foetuses, suggesting effect hepatic enzymes affecting glucose homeostasis transmitted F(1) F(2) generation. findings indicate even though energy nitrogen metabolism displayed effect protein provision early life, programming effects still appeared molecular level following generation.
