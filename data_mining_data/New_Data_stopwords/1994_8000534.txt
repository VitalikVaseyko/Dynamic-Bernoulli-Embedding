 Streptococcus mutans, important aetiological agent dental caries, known transport glucose via phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphotransferase system (PTS). alternative non-PTS glucose transport system S. mutans Ingbritt suggested increased ATP-dependent phosphorylation glucose presence higher cellular concentrations free glucose cells grown continuous culture PTS-repressed conditions compared resulting optimal PTS activity. method developed preparation membrane vesicles order study system absence PTS activity. vesicles low activity cytoplasmic enzymes, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. This, coupled lack glycolytic activity inability transport glucose, suggested vesicles would also deficient PTS activity absence general soluble PTS proteins, Enzyme HPr, required transport PTS sugars. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy membrane H(+)-ATPase analysis indicated 90% vesicles right-side-out orientation. Vesicles cells grown continuous culture PTS-dominant PTS-repressed conditions exhibited glucose counterflow. indicates presence constitutive non-PTS carrier organism capable transporting glucose utilizing ATP glucose phosphorylation. Analysis growth yields cells grown PTS-repressed PTS-optimal conditions suggests ATP, equivalent high energy molecule, must involved actual transport process. analysis consistent ATP-binding protein model Msm transport system reported R. R. B. Russell coworkers (J Biol Chem 267, 4631-4637), exclude possibility separate permease glucose.
