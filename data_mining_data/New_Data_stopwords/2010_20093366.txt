 Cancer cells gain growth advantages microenvironment shifting cellular metabolism aerobic glycolysis, so-called Warburg effect. growing interest targeting aerobic glycolysis cancer therapy exploiting differential susceptibility malignant versus normal cells glycolytic inhibition, proof-of-concept provided vivo efficacy dietary caloric restriction natural product-based energy restriction-mimetic agents (ERMAs) resveratrol 2-deoxyglucose suppressing carcinogenesis animal models. Here, identified thiazolidinediones novel class ERMAs elicited hallmark cellular responses characteristic energy restriction, including transient induction Sirt1 (silent information regulator 1) expression, activation intracellular fuel sensor AMP-activated protein kinase, endoplasmic reticulum stress, interplay among culminated autophagic apoptotic death. translational implications finding multifold. First, novel function troglitazone ciglitazone targeting energy restriction provides mechanistic basis account peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-independent effects broad spectrum signaling targets. Second, demonstrated Sirt1-mediated up-regulation beta-transducin repeat-containing protein-facilitated proteolysis cell cycle- apoptosis-regulatory proteins energy restriction-elicited signaling event critical antitumor effects ERMAs. Third, provides molecular rationale using thiazolidinediones scaffolds develop potent ERMAs, proof-of-principle demonstrated OSU-CG12. OSU-CG12, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-inactive ciglitazone derivative, exhibits 1- 3-order magnitude higher potency eliciting starvation-like cellular responses relative resveratrol 2-deoxyglucose, respectively.
