 Individual blastocysts cows cultured 3 h 5% CO2 air, 4 microliters droplets Ham's F-10 medium containing D-[5-3H]glucose, D-[1-14C]-glucose, D-[6-14C]glucose, [2-14C]pyruvate, L-[U-14C]glutamine, without 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) phenazine ethosulphate (PES). 14CO2 3H2O produced collected exchange outer bath 400 microliter 25 mM-NaHCO3. combinations substrate treatment (control, DNP PES) produced measurable quantities labelled product except D-[6-14C]glucose presence PES. Untreated DNP-treated embryos developed normally subsequent 48-h culture period fresh medium, PES-treated embryos degenerated. Pyruvate glutamine metabolism increased markedly presence DNP, indicating Krebs' cycle active, glutamine used energy substrate. Conversely, DNP significant effect glucose metabolism, indicating glycolysis blocked bovine blastocyst due lack inhibition pyruvate kinase. production 14CO2 D-[1-14C]glucose increased significantly presence PES, indicating activity pentose shunt less maximal.
