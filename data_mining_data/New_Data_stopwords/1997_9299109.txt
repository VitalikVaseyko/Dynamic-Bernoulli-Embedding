 Two nonpermeant cryoprotectants, disaccharide trehalose polymeric carbohydrate (dextran, 40 kDa), assessed substitutes glycerol cryopreservation human red blood cells (RBC). agents evaluated measuring percentage RBC recovery (total free hemoglobin freezing) evaluating erythrocyte state freezing. Ninety percent red cells recovered freezing 30% (w/v) dextran liquid nitrogen, close recovery obtained 35. 5% (w/v) glycerol (92%). activities pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase RBCs frozen thawed dextran modified, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate reduced 26%, remained within normal values. ATP reduced 56%. erythrocyte membrane integrity, evaluated osmotic fragility, altered, RBCs protected dextran retained normal discoid shape without formation microvesicles. 24-h hemolysis washed red cells storage 4 degrees C 7%. results suggest dextran protects red blood cells freezing liquid nitrogen, effort still needed limit drop ATP concentration. One main advantages dextran penetrate RBCs requires less washing glycerol.
