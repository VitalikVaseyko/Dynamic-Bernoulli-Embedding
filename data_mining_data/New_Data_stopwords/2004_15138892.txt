 crude root-peel extract Flemingia vestita, genistein praziquantel tested selected glycolytic enzymes--hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) malic enzyme (ME)--of fowl tape worm, Raillietina echinobothrida. Following exposure various treatments, activities HK, PFK, PEPCK LDH increased 33-39%, 41-125%, 44-49% 55-67%, respectively, PK decreased 14-26% parasite time paralysis. MDH activities tissue homogenate also found higher 22-43% 28-59%, respectively, treatments. However, whereas activity cytosolic mitochondrial MDH increased 33-58% 43-73%, respectively, cytosolic activity showed increase 33-39%, significant enhancement mitochondrial activity. Histochemically, enhancement activities HK, LDH MDH clearly discernible. enhanced glycolytic activity seems function anthelmintic stress caused phytochemicals.
