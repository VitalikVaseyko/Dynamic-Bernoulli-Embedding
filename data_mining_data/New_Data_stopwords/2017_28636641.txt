 range ATP concentrations measured fluorescent reagentless biosensor ATP increased modulating affinity analyte. ATP biosensor adduct two tetramethylrhodamines MatB Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Mutations introduced binding site modify ATP binding affinity, aiming maintain concomitant fluorescence signal. Using signal, effect mutations different parts binding site measured. mutational analysis revealed three variants particular, single mutation phosphate-binding loop, potentially beneficial changes ATP binding properties preserving fluorescence change ~3-fold ATP binding. Two variants (T167A T303A) weakened binding, changing dissociation constant parent's 6 muM 123 muM 42 muM, respectively. Kinetic measurements showed effect mutations affinity increase dissociation rate constants. variants widen range ATP concentration measured readily biosensor >100 muM. contrast, third variant, S170A, decreased dissociation constant ATP 3.8 muM fluorescence change 4.2 binding ATP. variant increased selectivity ATP ADP >200-fold. advantages parent increasing sensitivity well increasing selectivity ATP measurements ADP present.
