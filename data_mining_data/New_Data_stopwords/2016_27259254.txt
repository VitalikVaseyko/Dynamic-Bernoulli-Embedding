 transformation normal cells cancer cells accompanied switch oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) aerobic glycolysis, interesting ask cancer cells revert Warburg effect OXPHOS. previous works suggested cancer cells reverted OXPHOS, exposed lactic acidosis, common factor tumor environment. However, conclusion cannot drawn unless ATP output glycolysis OXPHOS quantitatively determined. quantitatively measured ATP generation glycolysis OXPHOS 9 randomly selected cancer cell lines. Without lactic acidosis, glycolysis OXPHOS generated 23.7% - 52.2 % 47.8% - 76.3% total ATP, respectively; lactic acidosis (20 mM lactate pH 6.7), glycolysis OXPHOS provided 5.7% - 13.4% 86.6% - 94.3% total ATP. concluded cancer cells lactic acidosis reverted Warburg effect OXPHOS phenotype.
