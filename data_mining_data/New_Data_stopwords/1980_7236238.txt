 Addition glucose Ehrlich-Landschutz ascites tumour cells preincubated 30-60 min phosphate-buffered Krebs-Ringer salt solution ("starved cells") resulted within 1-2 min approx. 90% decline ATP content massive accumulation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. alterations, took place aerobic anaerobic conditions, followed gradual spontaneous recovery restoration normal ATP fructose 1,6-bisphosphate values. transient derangement energy metabolism glucose addition starved ascites tumour cells preventable simultaneous addition pyruvate 2-oxobutyrate, preincubating cells presence glucose. protective effect pyruvate duplicated addition phenazine methosulphate NAD+ incubation medium. data seem warrant conclusion glucose-induced ATP depletion determined blockade glycolysis stage glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase caused failure cells oxidize NADH produced reaction. continued unrestrained action 6-phosphofructokinase results accumulation fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, constitutes trap high-energy phosphate bonds ATP. primary metabolic disturbance appears consist transient inhibition pyruvate kinase resultant inability cells maintain unimpaired supply pyruvate, required lactate dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation NADH. regulatory mechanism underlying phenomenon discussed.
