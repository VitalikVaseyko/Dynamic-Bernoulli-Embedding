 Recently, malic acid gained attention due potential application food, pharmaceutical, medical industries. study, synthetic scaffold complex strategy employed two key enzymes pyruvate kinase (PykF) malic enzyme (SfcA); SH3 ligand attached PykF, SH3 domain attached C-terminus ScfA. Synthetic scaffold systems organize enzymes spatially temporally increase local concentration intermediates. flask culture, recombinant strain harboring scaffold complex produced maximum concentration 5.72 g/L malic acid 10 g/L glucose. malic acid production significantly increased 2.1-fold initial culture period. Finally, malic acid production elevated 30.2 g 5 L bioreactor recombinant strain XL-1 blue.
