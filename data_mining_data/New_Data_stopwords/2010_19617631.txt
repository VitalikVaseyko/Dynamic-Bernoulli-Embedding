 Data animal experiments strongly suggest ceramide important mediator lipotoxicity heart accumulation ceramide contributes cardiomyocyte apoptosis associated type 2 diabetes obesity. However, remains unknown whether similar relationship present also human heart. Therefore, aimed examine whether myocardial apoptosis obese type 2 diabetic patients associated elevated ceramide level. study included 11 lean 26 overweight moderately obese subjects without (n = 11, OWT) (n = 15, T2D-OWT) history type 2 diabetes. Samples right atrial appendage obtained patients time coronary bypass surgery. Compared lean subjects, extent DNA fragmentation (a marker apoptosis) significantly higher myocardium OWT patients increased T2D-OWT subjects. However, content ceramide sphingoid bases remained stable. Interestingly, mRNA level enzymes involved synthesis degradation ceramide including serine palmitoyltransferase, sphingosine kinase 1, neutral sphingomyelinase, ceramidases markedly higher myocardium OWT T2D-OWT patients compared lean subjects. results indicate human heart, least atrium, ceramide major factor cardiomyocyte apoptosis associated obesity type 2 diabetes.
