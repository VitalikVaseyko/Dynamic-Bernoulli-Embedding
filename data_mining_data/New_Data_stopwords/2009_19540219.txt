 recently found genistein, plant-derived natural compound, novel cAMP signaling agonist pancreatic beta-cells. present study, show exposure clonal insulin secreting (INS-1E) cells genistein 48 h enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), whereas insulin content altered, suggesting genistein-enhanced GSIS due modulation insulin synthesis. genistein effect protein tyrosine kinase- K(ATP) channel-independent. addition, genistein effect glucose transporter-2 expression cellular ATP production, similarly augmented pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion INS-1E cells, indicating improvement insulin secretory function long-term genistein exposure related alternation glucose uptake glycolytic pathway. enhanced insulin secretion genistein associated elevated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration dependent protein kinase new protein synthesis effect completely blocked N-[2-(p-Bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide cycloheximide. Similarly, 48 h genistein exposure also enhanced GSIS freshly isolated mouse human pancreatic islets, suggesting non-species-specific biologically relevant effect. findings provide evidence genistein may novel bioactive compound anti-diabetic effect improving insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells.
