 Trypanosoma cruzi, protozoan causes Chagas disease, possesses complex life cycle involving different developmental stages. Experimental conditions two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis T. cruzi trypomastigote, amastigote epimastigote proteomes optimized. Comparative proteome analysis cell-cycle stages carried out, revealing proteins included 2-DE maps displayed significant differential expression among three developmental forms parasite. order identify landmark proteins, spots trypomastigote 2-DE map subjected matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight mass spectrometry peptide mass fingerprinting, resulting 26 identifications corresponded 19 different proteins. Among identified polypeptides, heat shock proteins (HSP; chaperones, HSP 60, HSP 70 HSP 90), elongation factors, glycolytic pathway enzymes (enolase, pyruvate kinase 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate mutase) structural proteins (KMP 11, tubulin paraflagellar rod components). relative expression identified proteins 2-DE maps T. cruzi developmental stages also presented.
