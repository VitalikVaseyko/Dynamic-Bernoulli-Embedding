 INTRODUCTION: Early detection and/or prediction metastasis provide prognostic relevance local recurrence. Direct spread peritoneum frequently found pancreatic cancer patients, positron emission tomography (PET) 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) useful identifying metastasis. investigated method enhance FDG accumulation using AsPC-1 human ascites tumor cells. METHODS: (14)C-FDG accumulation assessed following conditions: 1) characteristics (14)C-FDG transport examined using phloridzin, Na(+)-free buffer, various hexoses, 2) accumulation (14)C-FDG measured cells pretreated hexose various time periods, activity 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) assayed. RESULTS: (14)C-FDG transport AsPC-1 cells mediated primarily Na(+)-independent transport mechanism. Aldohexoses d-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose inhibited (14)C-FDG transport. Cells pretreated d-glucose, D-mannose, D-fructose exhibited augmented (14)C-FDG accumulation. Pretreatment higher concentrations D-glucose D-fructose tended increase PFK-1 activity. CONCLUSIONS: little information published association PFK-1 FDG accumulation, confirmed impacts various hexoses activity PFK-1 FDG accumulation AsPC-1 cells. Clarifying relevance PFK-1 FDG accumulation contribute developing new features FDG-PET, PFK-1 main regulator glycolysis.
