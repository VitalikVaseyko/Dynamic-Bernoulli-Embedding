 utilized proteomic techniques primate model (Macaca fascicularis) aging determine potential mechanisms explain gender differences protection aging heart. majority prior work field utilized rodent models, importantly prior study utilized proteomic approach aging heart. studied changes proteins seven monkeys group (young old males females (YMs, OMs, YFs, OFs, respectively)), used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combination mass spectrometry five monkeys group. found decreases (P < 0.05) expression key enzymes glycolysis (e.g. pyruvate kinase, alpha-enolase, triosephosphate isomerase), glucose oxidation (e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 beta-subunit), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) left ventricular (LV) samples OM monkeys; changes glycolytic, glucose oxidation, TCA enzymes observed either YMs, YFs OFs. found additional gender differences reduced expression function proteins responsible electron transport oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria hearts OM monkeys, corresponding decreased oxidation rates NADH ascorbate-N,N,N',N' ''-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine substrates. changes glycolytic mitochondrial metabolic pathways OM monkey hearts similar changes observed hearts affected diabetes LV dysfunction, could involved mechanism cardiomyopathy aging. sparing changes hearts could involved mechanism mediating delayed cardiovascular risk OFs.
