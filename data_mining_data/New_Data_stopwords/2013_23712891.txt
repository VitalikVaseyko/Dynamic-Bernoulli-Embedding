 previously demonstrated simplicity oxygen-deprived Corynebacterium glutamicum produce D-lactate, primary building block next-generation biodegradable plastics, high optical purity introducing heterologous D-ldhA gene Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Here, independently evaluated effects overexpressing genes encoding ten glycolytic enzymes D-lactate production C. glutamicum. consequently show reactions catalyzed glucokinase (GLK), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphofructokinase (PFK), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), bisphosphate aldolase positive effects D-lactate productivity increasing 98, 39, 15, 13, 10 %, respectively, 10 h reactions minimal salts medium, reaction catalyzed pyruvate kinase large negative effect decreasing 70 %. glycolytic enzymes affect D-lactate productivity encoding genes overexpressed. noteworthy reactions associated positive effects located upstream glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate glycolytic pathway. D-lactate yield also increased especially overexpressing TPI encoding gene 94.5 %. Interestingly, overexpression PFK encoding gene reduced yield succinate, one main by-products D-lactate production, 52 %, whereas overexpression GAPDH encoding gene increased succinate yield 26 %. Overexpression GLK encoding gene markedly increased yield dihydroxyacetone glycerol 10- 5.8-fold exchange decreasing D-lactate yield. effect overexpressing glycolytic genes also evaluated 80 h long-term reactions. variety effects overexpressing genes encoding ten glycolytic enzymes D-lactate production discussed.
