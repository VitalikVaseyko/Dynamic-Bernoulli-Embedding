 gene coding pyruvate kinase Trypanoplasma borelli cloned characterized. single gene copy found open reading frame polypeptide 496 amino acids molecular mass 54337. deduced amino acid sequence calculated net charge -3. Comparison sequence pyruvate kinases members family Trypanosomatidae revealed amino acid identities 58.4-61.5%, and, extent, conservation residues supposed involved binding allosteric effector fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. kinetic properties Trypanoplasma borelli pyruvate kinase determined appear similar enzyme Trypanosoma brucei Leishmania mexicana.
