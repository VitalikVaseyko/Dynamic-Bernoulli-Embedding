 Broilers genetic origin classified short long tonic immobility duration (STI LTI, respectively) phenotypes treated chronically vehicle (control) corticosterone (CORT) dissolved drinking water 27 42 age. Differential expression proteins mRNA examined using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis real-time PCR elucidate mechanism behind severe retardation broiler breast muscle growth caused LTI CORT. majority 13 proteins found differentially expressed breast muscle STI LTI broilers involved either glycolysis (5 proteins) myofilament formation (5 proteins). 16 proteins differentially expressed breast muscle following CORT treatment, 6 structural proteins, 5 categorized cellular defense stress proteins, 3 (pyruvate kinase, l-lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase) involved responses stress muscle damage. Real-time PCR results indicated expression proteins transcriptionally posttranscriptionally regulated. Protein synthesis capacity, estimated RNA-to-protein ratio, significantly lower breast muscle CORT-treated broilers untreated control broilers. level Leu, Gly, Ser serum significantly higher CORT-treated broilers control birds. Therefore, conclude CORT treatment retards growth skeletal muscle suppressing protein synthesis augmenting protein catabolism, paralleling response severe stress muscle damage, negative effect LTI muscle growth likely mediated glucose metabolism. interaction observed CORT tonic immobility affecting growth performance parameter examined current study.
