 Sand rats (Psammomys obesus) maintained diet providing free choice laboratory chow salt bush (Atriplex halimus) classified four groups differing extent diabetic syndrome: A, normoglycemic-normoinsulinemic; B, normoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic; C, hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic; D, hyperglycemic reduced insulin levels. metabolic pattern groups characterized measuring uptake fatty acid-labeled, very-low-density lipoprotein-borne triglycerides (VLDL-TG) [3H]-2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) muscle adipose tissues; incorporation [14C]alanine glycogen vivo; gluconeogenesis lactate, pyruvate, alanine hepatocytes; effect insulin glycogen synthesis glucose; oxidation albumin-bound [1-14C]palmitate [14C]glucose strips soleus muscle; activities muscle adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase; activities rate-limiting enzymes glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis liver. group A, uptake VLDL-TG activity lipoprotein lipase higher adipose tissue lower muscle albino rats. liver, gluconeogenesis activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, well lipid synthesis activity NADP-malate dehydrogenase, higher albino rats, whereas activity pyruvate kinase lower. group B, uptake VLDL-TG adipose tissue muscle lipoprotein lipase activity similar higher group A. Uptake 2-DOG muscle adipose tissue activity liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase lower group A. groups C D, uptake VLDL-TG lipoprotein lipase activity muscle increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
