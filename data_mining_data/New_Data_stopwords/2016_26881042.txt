 BACKGROUND. Ageing associated suppressed regenerative potential muscle precursor cells due decrease satellite cells suppressive intramuscular milieu activation, associated ageing-related low-grade inflammation. aim study characterize function oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glycolysis, adenylate kinase (AK), creatine kinase (CK) mediated systems young older individuals. MATERIALS METHODS. Myoblasts cultivated biopsies taken transcutaneous conchotomy vastus lateralis muscle young (20-29 yrs, n = 7) older (70-79 yrs, n = 7) subjects. Energy metabolism assessed passages 2 6 oxygraphy enzyme analysis. RESULTS. myoblasts young older subjects rate OXPHOS decreased proliferation passages 2 6. total activities CK AK decreased. Myoblasts passage 2 cultivated young muscle showed higher rate OXPHOS activities CK AK compared myoblasts older subjects hexokinase pyruvate kinase affected ageing. CONCLUSIONS. Proliferation myoblasts vitro associated downregulation OXPHOS energy storage transfer systems. Ageing vivo exerts impact satellite cells results altered metabolic profile favour prevalence glycolytic pathways mitochondrial OXPHOS myoblasts.
