 BACKGROUND: Warburg effect hallmark cancer cells. Accumulating evidence suggests microRNAs (miRs) could regulate metabolic reprograming. Aberrant expression miR-98 observed many types cancers. However, functions significance colon cancer remain largely elusive. AIMS: investigate miR-98 expression biological functions colon cancer progression. METHODS: miR-98 expression levels determined quantitative RT-PCR 215 cases colon cancer samples. miR-98 mimic inhibitor used test biological functions SW480 HCT116 cells, followed cell proliferation assay, lactate production, glucose uptake, cellular ATP levels assay extracellular acidification rates measurement. Western blot luciferase assay used identify target miR-98. RESULTS: miR-98 significantly down-regulated colon cancer tissues compared adjacent colon tissues acted suppressor Warburg effect cancer cells. miR-98 inhibited glycolysis directly targeting hexokinase 2, HK2, illustrating novel pathway mediate Warburg effect cancer cells. vitro experiments indicated HK2 involved miR-98-mediated suppression glucose uptake, lactate production, cell proliferation. addition, detected HK2 expression colon cancer tissues found expressions miR-98 HK2 negatively correlated. CONCLUSION: miR-98 acts tumor suppressor gene inhibits Warburg effect colon cancer cells, provided potential targets clinical treatments.
