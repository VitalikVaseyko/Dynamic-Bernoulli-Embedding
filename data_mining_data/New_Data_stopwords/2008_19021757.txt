 Tyr235 GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase fully invariant residue. aromatic ring residue establishes energetically favorable weak anion-quadrupole interaction PEP carboxylate. role Tyr235 catalysis investigated via kinetic analysis site-directed mutagenesis-derived variants. Y235F change lowered apparent K(m) PEP six-fold, raised apparent K(m) Mn(2+) 70-fold, decreased oxaloacetate (OAA)-forming activity 10-fold. effects due enhanced anion-quadrupole interaction aromatic side chain position 235, lacked hydroxyl group, PEP carboxylate, probably increased distance PEP Mn(2+) consequently affected phosphoryl transfer step overall catalysis. Y235A Y235S changes, elimination favorable edge-on interaction increased apparent K(m) PEP four- six-fold, respectively, apparent K(m) Mn(2+) eight- six-fold, respectively. pyruvate kinase-like activity, representing PEP dephosphorylation step OAA-forming reaction, affected substitutions similar way complete reaction. observations indicate aromatic ring Tyr235 helps position PEP active site hydroxyl group allows optimal PEP-Mn(2+) distance efficient phosphoryl transfer overall catalysis. Y235A Y235S changes drastically reduced PEP-forming OAA decarboxylase activities, probably due elimination stabilizing interaction Tyr235 respective products, PEP pyruvate.
