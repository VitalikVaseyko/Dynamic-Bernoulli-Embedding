 Cancer cells, opposed normal cells, generate energy increasing aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon called "the Warburg effect". altered energy metabolism supporting continuous cell growth proliferation pointed new "hallmark" cancer cells. Several hypotheses proposed explain maintenance seemingly wasteful catabolic state. epigenetic mechanisms depend covalent modifications DNA histones recently emerged important players regulation glucose metabolism. sirtuin family histone deacetylases emerged important regulators diverse physiological pathological events, including cancer metabolism. Sirtuins 1-7 (SIRT1-7) belong class III histone deacetylase enzymes dependent NAD(+) activity. recently demonstrated SIRT6 tumor suppressor modulates aerobic glycolysis repressing HIF1 transcription. Members family enzymes considered promising pharmaceutical targets cancer treatment. review highlights major functions sirtuins relation cancer metabolism possibilities activation inhibition small molecule drugs.
