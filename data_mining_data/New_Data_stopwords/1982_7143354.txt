 Derivatives adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) substituent 1-4 atoms eight positions synthesized evaluated substrates inhibitors liver (L), muscle (M), kidney (K) isozymes rat pyruvate kinase (PK). Inhibitory potencies compounds expressed KM (ADP)/Ki KM (ADP)/KM Ki value available. Nine 14 ADP derivatives exhibited differential inhibitions. K isozymes, cross-react immunologically L form, inhibited differentially 5 14 derivatives. PK-K preferentially inhibited two derivatives, PK-L three derivatives, PK-M two derivatives. Among selective and/or effective inhibitors 3'-OMe-ADP [KM (ADP)/Ki = 0.07 PK-K; inhibitory potency, K/M/L, 7.6:6.0:1], N6-Me,N6-(CH2)4N(Me)COMe-ADP (prepared previously) [KM (ADP)/KM = 0.43 PK-L; inhibitory potency, L/K/M, 3:2:1], 8-NHEt-ADP [KM (ADP)/Ki = 1.0 PK-M; inhibitory potency, M/K/L, 7.1:1.2:1]. previous studies two enzymes indicate monosubstituted substrate derivatives bear short substituents (usually 1-4 atoms) various positions potentially useful probes early stages attempted design isozyme-selective inhibitors.
