 BACKGROUND: enzyme composition different muscle types vary greatly, leading different changes enzyme level caused exposure various stimuli. METHODS: Male Wistar rats centrifuged 2G 12-ft radius centrifuge 14 d. Tibialis anterior (TA) soleus muscles four centrifuge four control rats analyzed three enzymes characteristic fast twitch muscles (phosphofructokinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase), four enzymes characteristic slow twitch muscles (hexokinase, mitochondrial thiolase, B-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, citrate synthase). RESULTS: centrifuged TA muscles lost 15% weight; corresponding soleus muscles gained 4%. Calculated basis dry weight, fast twitch enzyme activities reduced 3-15% TA muscles increased 10-23% soleus muscles. slow twitch enzymes reduced 18-30% TA muscles almost unchanged soleus muscles. calculated basis total muscle weight, enzymes TA muscles significantly reduced centrifugation. contrast, soleus muscles, basis total muscle weight, centrifugation caused average increase 22% fast twitch enzymes marginal changes slow twitch enzymes.
