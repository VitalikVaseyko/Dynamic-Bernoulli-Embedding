 Intermediary metabolism provides living cells free energy precursor metabolites required synthesizing proteins, lipids, RNA cellular constituents, highly conserved among living species. fraction cellular protein can, however, allocated enzymes intermediary metabolism consequently metabolic trade-offs may take place. One trade-off, aerobic fermentation, occurs yeast (the Crabtree effect) cancer cells (the Warburg effect) scientific challenge decades. show, using flux balance analysis combined vitro measured enzyme specific activities, fermentation catalytically efficient respiration, i.e. produces ATP per protein mass. switch fermentation high growth rates therefore consequence high ATP production rate, provided limited pool enzymes. catalytic efficiency also higher cells grown glucose compared galactose ethanol, may explain observed differences growth rates. enzyme F1F0-ATP synthase (Complex V) found flux control respiration model, since evolutionary conserved, expect trade-off occur organisms kingdoms life.
