 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) liver results hepatocytes (HP) sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) irreversible damage. Ischemic preconditioning protects IR damage upon adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) stimulation. Understanding phenotypic changes underlie hepatocellular damage protection critical optimize strategies IR. METHODS: proteome HP LSEC, isolated sham IR exposed mice, receiving A2aR agonist CGS21680 (0.5mg/kg b.w.), analyzed 2-D DIGE/MALDI-TOF. RESULTS: identified 64 proteins involved cytoprotection, regeneration, energy metabolism response oxidative stress; among them, 34 associated IR injury A2aR protection. main pathways, downregulated IR upregulated CGS21680 HP LSEC, related carbohydrate, protein lipid supply metabolism. LSEC, IR reduced stress response enzymes instead upregulated CGS21680 treatment. Functional validation experiments confirmed metabolic involvement showed inhibition pyruvate kinase, 3-chetoacylCoA thiolase, arginase reduced protection CGS21680 vitro hypoxia-reoxygenation injury, whereas metabolic products induced liver cell protection. Moreover, LSEC, HP, sensitive H2O2-induced oxidative damage CGS21680 protected effect. CONCLUSIONS: IR A2aR stimulation produces pathological protected liver cell phenotypes, respectively characterized down- upregulation proteins involved response O2 nutrients deprivation ischemia, oxidative stress, reactivation aerobic energy synthesis reperfusion. provides novel insights IR hepatocellular damage protection, suggests additional therapeutic options.
