 BACKGROUND: Warburg effect refers glycolytic production adenosine triphosphate aerobic conditions, universal property cancer cells. Chronic inflammation key factor promoting Warburg effect. study aimed determine whether rosmarinic acid (RA) anti-Warburg effect gastric carcinoma vitro vivo. mechanism anti-Warburg effect also investigated. METHODS: MTT assay used examine MKN45 cell growth vitro. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay used detect proinflammatory cytokines. Real-time polymerase chain reaction used evaluate levels microRNA expression cells. Protein expression determined Western blotting assay. Mouse xenograft models established using MKN45 cells assess anti-Warburg effect gastric carcinoma vivo. RESULTS: RA suppressed glucose uptake lactate production. also inhibited expression transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, affects glycolytic pathway. Inflammation promoted Warburg effect cancer cells. expected, RA inhibited proinflammatory cytokines microRNAs related inflammation, suggesting RA may suppress Warburg effect via inflammatory pathway, involving interleukin (IL)-6/signal transducer activator transcription-3 (STAT3). miR-155 found important mediator relationship inflammation tumorigenesis. showed miR-155 target gene regulating Warburg effect via inactivation IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Moreover, found RA suppressed Warburg effect vivo. CONCLUSION: RA might potentially therapeutic agent suppressing Warburg effect gastric carcinoma.
