 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2) activity enhanced dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase core (E2 60mer) binds PDK2 large number pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) substrate. E2-activated PDK2, K(+) approximately 90 mM Cl(-) approximately 60 mM decreased K(m) PDK2 ATP competitive K(i) ADP approximately 3-fold enhanced pyruvate inhibition. Comparing PDK2 catalysis +/- E2, E2 increased K(m) PDK2 ATP nearly 8-fold (from 5 39 microM), increased k(cat) approximately 4-fold, decreased requirement E1 least 400-fold. ATP binding, measured cold-trapping technique, occurred two active sites K(d) 5 microM, equals K(m) K(d) PDK2 ATP measured absence E2. E2-aided catalysis, PDK2 approximately 3 times ADP ATP bound active site, pyruvate analogue, dichloroacetate, led 16-fold ADP ATP bound (no added ADP). Pyruvate functioned uncompetitive inhibitor versus ATP, inclusion ADP transformed pyruvate inhibition noncompetitive. high pyruvate levels, pyruvate partial inhibitor also induced substrate inhibition high ATP levels. results indicate that, physiological salt levels, ADP dissociation limiting step E2-activated PDK2 catalysis, PDK2.[ADP ATP].pyruvate complexes form, PDK2.ATP.pyruvate.E1 reacts PDK2.ADP.pyruvate accumulating.
