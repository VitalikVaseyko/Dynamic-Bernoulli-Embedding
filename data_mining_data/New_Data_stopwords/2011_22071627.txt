 activation ceramide-generating enzymes, blockade ceramide degradation, addition ceramide analogues trigger apoptosis necrosis human cancer cells. Moreover, endogenous ceramide plays decisive role killing neoplastic cells conventional anticancer chemotherapeutics. Here, explored possibility membrane-permeable C2-ceramide might kill budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells fermentative conditions, exhibit rapid proliferation Warburg-like metabolism reminiscent cancer cells. C2-ceramide efficiently induced generation reactive oxygen species (ROS), well apoptotic necrotic cell death, effect influenced deletion sole yeast metacaspase. However, C2-ceramide largely failed cause ROS hypergeneration cell death upon deletion mitochondrial genome. Thus, mitochondrial function strictly required C2-ceramide-induced yeast lethality. Accordingly, mitochondria C2-ceramide-treated yeast cells exhibited major morphological alterations including organelle fragmentation aggregation. Altogether, results point pivotal role mitochondria ceramide-induced yeast cell death.
