 Insulin stimulates fatty acid synthesis white brown fat cells well liver mammary tissue. Hormones increase cellular cyclic AMP concentrations inhibit fatty acid synthesis, least white adipose tissue liver. changes fatty acid synthesis occur within minutes. white fat cells, brought changes glucose transport also changes activities pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase acetyl-CoA carboxylase. basis alterations pyruvate kinase activity fat cells understood. Unlike liver isoenzyme, isoenzyme present fat cells appear phosphorylated either absence presence hormones. changes pyruvate dehydrogenase activity fat cells undoubtedly due changes phosphorylation alpha subunits. Insulin appears act causing parallel dephosphorylation three sites. persistence effect insulin preparation subsequent incubation mitochondria allowed demonstration insulin acts mainly stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase rather inhibiting kinase. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase within fat cells phosphorylated number different sites. exposure cells insulin leads activation enzyme associated increased phosphorylation specific site enzyme. Exposure adrenalin, results marked diminution activity, also causes small increase overall level phosphorylation, increase due enhanced phosphorylation different sites; probably phosphorylated cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase one number proteins fat cells exhibit increased phosphorylation insulin. Others include ATP-citrate lyase, ribosomal protein S6, beta subunit insulin receptor heat acid stable protein Mr 22000. Changes phosphorylation ATP-citrate lyase appear result appreciable changes catalytic activity. central aspect insulin action may activation perhaps release membrane-associated protein kinase. Plasma membranes fat cells shown contain cyclic-nucleotide-independent kinase able phosphorylate activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Furthermore, high-speed supernatant fractions cells previously exposed insulin contain elevated levels similar kinase activity capable phosphorylating ATP-citrate lyase acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
