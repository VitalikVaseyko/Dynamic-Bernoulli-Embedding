 (1) Pyruvate kinase type M2 rat lung purified 840-fold overall yield 20%. enzyme gave single band upon SDS-electrophoresis isoelectrofocusing specific activity 1340 U/mg protein. homotetramer Mr = 224000 isoelectric point pH 5.8 amino acid composition closely resembling pyruvate kinase isoenzymes type M2, except chicken liver. enzyme crystallized. (2) enzyme pH optimum pH 6.5. K0.5 value phosphoenolpyruvate 0.26 mM (nH = 1.81) decreases presence 0.2 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 0.056 mM (nH = 1.06). 1 microM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activates enzyme 0.1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate half-maximally. Km value ADP 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate 0.4 mM. Km value nucleoside diphosphates increases order ADP less GDP less IDP less UDP. (3) evidence interconversion pyruvate kinase type M2 rat chicken lung found. enzyme neither substrate cAMP-dependent protein kinase rabbit muscle cAMP-independent protein kinase chicken liver. Since pyruvate kinase type M2 chicken liver inactivated phosphorylation catalyzed cAMP-independent protein kinase (Eigenbrodt, E., Abdel-Fattah Mostafa, M. Schoner, W. (1977) Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 358, 1047-1055) suggest interconvertible form pyruvate kinase type M2 may represent separate form pyruvate kinase type M2 family.
