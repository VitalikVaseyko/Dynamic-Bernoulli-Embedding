 Cancer cells prefer aerobic glycolysis, little known underlying mechanism. Recent studies showed rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) directly phosphorylates H3 threonine 11 (H3T11) regulate gene expression cell proliferation, revealing non-metabolic functions connecting glycolysis histone modifications. reported yeast homolog PKM2, Pyk1 phosphorylates H3T11 regulate gene expression oxidative stress resistance. glycolysis regulates H3T11 phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, using series glycolytic enzyme mutants commercial available metabolites, investigated role glycolytic enzymes metabolites H3T11 phosphorylation. Mutation glycolytic genes including phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI1), enolase (ENO2), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI1), folate biosynthesis enzyme (FOL3) significantly reduced H3T11 phosphorylation. study demonstrated glycolysis regulates H3T11 phosphorylation fueling substrate, phosphoenonylpyruvate coactivator, FBP Pyk1. Thus, results provide comprehensive view glycolysis modulates H3T11 phosphorylation.
