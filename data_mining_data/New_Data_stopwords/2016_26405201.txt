 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) regulate production acetyl-CoA, functions acetyl donor diverse enzymatic reactions, including histone acetylation. However, mechanism acetyl-CoA required histone acetylation ensured gene context-dependent manner clear. show PKM2, E2 subunit PDC histone acetyltransferase p300 constitute complex chromatin arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), transcription factor associated xenobiotic metabolism. factors recruited enhancer AhR-target genes, AhR-dependent manner. PKM2 contributes enhancement transcription cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), AhR-target gene, acetylation lysine 9 histone H3 CYP1A1 enhancer. Site-directed mutagenesis PKM2 indicates enhancement histone acetylation requires pyruvate kinase activity enzyme. Furthermore, reveal PDC activity present nuclei. Based findings, propose local acetyl-CoA production system PKM2 PDC locally supply acetyl-CoA p300 abundant PEP histone acetylation gene enhancer, data suggest PKM2 sensitizes AhR-mediated detoxification actively proliferating cells cancer fetal cells.
