 forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 critical regulator hepatic glucose lipid metabolism, dysregulation FoxO1 function implicated diabetes insulin resistance. globally identified FoxO1 occupancy mouse hepatic chromatin genome-wide level chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). establish specific functional significance FoxO1 FoxO proteins, ChIP-seq performed chromatin liver-specific FoxO1 knockout wild-type mice. identified 401 genome-wide FoxO1-binding locations. Motif search reveals sequence element, 5' GTAAACA 3', consistent previously known FoxO1-binding site. Gene set enrichment analysis shows data FoxO1 ChIP-seq highly correlated global expression profiling genes regulated FoxO1, demonstrating functional relevance FoxO1 ChIP-seq study. Interestingly, gene ontology analysis reveals functional significance FoxO1 retinoid metabolic processes. show FoxO1 directly binds genomic sites genes retinoid metabolism. Notably, deletion FoxO1 caused significantly reduced induction Pck1 Pdk4 response retinoids. Pck1 Pdk4 downstream targets retinoid signaling, results suggest FoxO1 plays potential role linking retinoid metabolism hepatic gluconeogenesis.
