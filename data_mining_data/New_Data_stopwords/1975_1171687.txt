 1. Effects alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate alpha-cyanocinnamate number enzymes involved pyruvate metabolism investigated. Little inhibition observed enzyme concentrations inhibit completely mitochondrial pyruvate transport. much higher concentrations (1 mM) inhibition pyruvate carboxylase apparent. 2. Alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (1-100 muM) specifically inhibited pyruvate oxidation mitochondria isolated rat heart, brain, kidney blowfly flight muscle; oxidation substrates presence absence ADP affected. Similar concentrations compound also inhibited carboxylation pyruvate rat liver mitochondria activation pyruvate pyruvate dehydrogenase fat-cell mitochondria. findings imply pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pyruvate carboxylase exposed mitochondrial matrix concentrations pyruvate rather cytoplasmic concentrations. 3. Studies whole-cell preparations incubated vitro indicate alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate alpha-cyanocinnamate (at concentrations 200 muM) used specifically inhibit mitochondrial pyruvate transport within cells thus alter metabolic emphasis preparation. epididymal fat-pads, fatty acid synthesis glucose fructose, acetate, markedly inhibited. changes tissue ATP concentrations observed. effects fatty acid synthesis reversible. kidney-cortex slices, gluconeogenesis pyruvate lactate succinate inhibited. rat heart perfused medium containing glucose insulin, addition alpha-cyanocinnamate (200 muM) greatly increased output tissue concentrations lactate plus pyruvate decreased lactate/pyruvate ratio. 4. inhibition cyanocinnamate derivatives pyruvate transport across cell membrane human erythrocytes requires much higher concentrations derivatives inhibition transport across mitochondrial membrane. Alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate appears enter erythrocytes cell-membrane pyruvate carrier. Entry observed presence albumin, may explain small effects compounds injected whole animals.
