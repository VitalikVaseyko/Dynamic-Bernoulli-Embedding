 effects 100 g/kg substitution guar gum body-weight gain, food consumption faecal dry weight mice fed high-sucrose diet activities hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44), malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.40), ATP-citrate (pro-3S)-lyase (EC 4.1.3.8), 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) studied. Guar gum effect body-weight gain food consumption increased faecal dry weight. Guar gum increased activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+) 6-phosphofructokinase expressed wet-liver-weight basis. Guar gum increased activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating)(NADP+), ATP-citrate (pro-3S)-lyase 6-phosphofructokinase expressed liver-protein basis. Guar gum increased activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating)(NADP+) expressed body-weight basis. results suggest guar gum increases flux pathways hepatic lipogenesis mice fed high-sucrose diets.
