 Short- long-term regulation hepatic carbohydrate metabolism insulin-like growth factor II studied primary cultures adult rat hepatocytes compared metabolic potency insulin. Insulin-like growth factor II stimulated glycogen synthesis [14C]glucose, uptake [3H]aminoisobutyric acid [14C]lactate formation [14C]glucose three-fold. Basal glycogenolysis inhibited 10%, glucagon-activated glycogenolysis blocked completely. enzymatic activity glucokinase pyruvate kinase induced two-fold, glucagon-dependent induction phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase antagonized. Compared insulin, half-maximal responses required 50 times higher insulin-like growth factor II concentrations ranging 10-20 nmol/l. similar difference observed binding affinity insulin-like growth factor II insulin receptor. interaction insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate (IGF-II/Man-6-P) receptor examined studying 125I-insulin-like growth factor II binding uptake lysosomal enzymes. affinity insulin-like growth factor II IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor considerably higher insulin receptor. Antibodies IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor affect metabolic responses insulin-like growth factor II, binding receptor receptor-mediated endocytosis arylsulphatase strongly inhibited. Thus, adult rat liver insulin-like growth factor II appeared exert metabolic actions via interaction receptor low affinity binding hepatic insulin receptors.
