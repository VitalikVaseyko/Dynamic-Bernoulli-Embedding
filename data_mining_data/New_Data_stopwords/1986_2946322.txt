 intracellular distribution glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase isoenzymes type M1 type M2 within unfertilized hen eggs studied. glycolytic enzyme activities found yolk fraction; 8-24% total glycolytic enzyme activities found vitelline membrane fraction. However, specific activities enzymes vitelline membrane fraction 19-72-fold higher (U/mg protein) 45-178-fold concentrated (U/g wet weight) yolk fraction. study intracellular localization pyruvate kinase isoenzymes shows blastodisc, latebra vitelline membrane contain pyruvate kinase type M2, whereas pyruvate kinase types M1 M2 found egg yolk. exclusive occurrence pyruvate kinase type M2 blastodisc consistent concept isoenzyme involved cell proliferation. heterogeneous distribution glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase, heterogeneous localization pyruvate kinase isoenzymes types M1 M2 indicate glycolysis distributed heterogeneously within unfertilized hen egg cell.
