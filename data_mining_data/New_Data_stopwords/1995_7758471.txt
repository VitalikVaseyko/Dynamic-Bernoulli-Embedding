 provision diet high saturated monounsaturated fat 28 days evoked significant (1.9-fold) increase pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase activity measured isolated mitochondria representative slow-twitch (oxidative) skeletal muscles (pooled soleus adductor longus muscles) adult rats. increase observed response 28 days high-fat feeding slow-twitch skeletal muscle mitochondria similar magnitude observed heart mitochondria. Pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase activity increased response provision high-fat diet mitochondria prepared representative fast-twitch muscle (tibialis anterior), increases evoked 28 days high-fat feeding cardiac slow-twitch skeletal muscle prevented replacement 7% dietary fatty acids long-chain omega-3 fatty acids marine oil. Cardiac myocytes prepared high-fat-fed rats showed impaired responses enzyme n-octanoate (1 mM) N6,2-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (50 microM) individually cultured cardiac myocytes glucose uptake insulin low concentrations freshly prepared cardiac myocytes, compared control rats maintained standard low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet. impairments responses agonists substantially improved inclusion long-chain omega-3 fatty acids high-fat diet. results indicate pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase activity oxidative skeletal muscle target longer-term regulation high-fat feeding fatty acid composition diet, rather fat content, key influence.
