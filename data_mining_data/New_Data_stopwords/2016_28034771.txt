 Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) tumor suppressor acts metabolic energy sensor regulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling commonly mutated various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumor cells deficient LKB1 may uniquely sensitized metabolic stresses, may offer therapeutic window oncology. address question explored functional LKB1 impacts metabolism NSCLC cells using (13)C metabolic flux analysis. Isogenic NSCLC cells expressing functional LKB1 exhibited higher flux oxidative mitochondrial pathways compared deficient LKB1. Re-expression LKB1 also increased capacity cells oxidize major mitochondrial substrates, including pyruvate, fatty acids, glutamine. Furthermore, LKB1 expression promoted adaptive response energy stress induced anchorage-independent growth. Finally, diminished adaptability sensitized LKB1-deficient cells combinatorial inhibition mitochondrial complex glutaminase. Together, data implicate LKB1 major regulator adaptive metabolic reprogramming suggest synergistic pharmacological strategies mitigating LKB1-deficient NSCLC tumor growth.
