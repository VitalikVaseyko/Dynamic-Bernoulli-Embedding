 Pyruvatekinase hepatopancreas common shore crab, Carcinus maenas, purified specific activity 240 units/mg protein assay conditions described. 2. one method purification enzymic activity could resolved two fractions chromatography DEAE-cellulose. Fructose 1, 6-diphosphate able effect conversion one form (peak 1) second (peak 2). 3. presence saturating concentration fructose 1, 6-diphosphate forms enzyme kinetically similar. 4. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis enzyme 1 day preparation showed single protein band. storage least three protein bands became visible, associated pyruvate kinase activity. 5. Chromatography enzyme Sephadex G-200 indicated mol.wt. 247000, presence fructose 1, 6-diphosphate elution volume enzyme increased corresponding mol.wt. 193000. 6 Dissociation enzyme sodium dodecyl sulphate 2-mercaptoethanol followed polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis produced one major protein band mol.wt. 55000.
