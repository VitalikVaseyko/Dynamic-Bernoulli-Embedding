 Fatty acids (FAs) acquired free FA associated albumin lipoprotein triglyceride hydrolyzed lipoprotein lipase (LpL). Hypertrophied hearts shift substrate usage pattern glucose less FA. However, FAs may still important source energy hypertrophied hearts. aim study examine importance LpL-derived FAs hypertensive hypertrophied hearts. followed cardiac function metabolic changes 2 wk angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced hypertension control heart-specific lipoprotein lipase knockout (hLpL0) mice. Glucose metabolism increased ANG II-treated control (control/ANG II) hearts, raising level hLpL0 hearts. FA uptake-related genes, CD36 FATP1, reduced control/ANG II hearts levels found hLpL0 hearts. ANG II alter metabolic genes hLpL0 mice. LpL activity preserved, mitochondrial FA oxidation-related genes altered control/ANG II hearts. control/ANG II hearts, triglyceride stores consumed reached levels hLpL0/ANG II hearts. Intracellular ATP content reduced hLpL0/ANG II hearts. ANG II deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt induced hypertension caused heart failure hLpL0 mice. data suggest LpL activity required normal cardiac metabolic compensation hypertensive stress.
