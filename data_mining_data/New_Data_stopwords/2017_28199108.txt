 Libraries nonpurified resorcinol amide derivatives screened surface plasmon resonance (SPR) determine binding dissociation constant (off-rate, kd) compounds binding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) enzyme. Parallel off-rate measurements HSP90 application structure-based drug design enabled rapid hit lead progression program identify pan-isoform ATP-competitive inhibitors PDHK. Lead optimization identified selective sub-100-nM inhibitors enzyme significantly reduced phosphorylation E1alpha subunit PC3 cancer cell line vitro.
