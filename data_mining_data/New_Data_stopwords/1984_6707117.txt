 affinity Blue Sepharose several proteins known structure showed pH dependence governed isoelectric points; Blue Sepharose behaved like strong cationic ion exchanger negative charges dye ligand, Cibacron Blue. study protein-Cibacron Blue interactions phase partition equilibrium dialysis revealed presence high-affinity binding sites case (di)nucleotide-dependent enzymes possess structural domain known "dinucleotide fold", case proteins consisting almost entirely alpha-helix (human haemoglobin, cytochrome c) beta-sheet (human immunoglobulin G). presence additional sites low affinity, probably situated protein surface, also inferred equilibrium dialysis data. instances, contrast Sepharose-immobilized dye, interaction free Cibacron Blue proteins pH dependent. Steric factors could responsible differential behaviour. suggested certain nucleotide-dependent enzymes might also bind Blue Sepharose ion exchange. Preparative applications findings illustrated discussed terms optimization affinity chromatography experiments.
