 proteins postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction cerebral cortex resolved two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) 30 proteins identified characteristic 2DE mobility, immunoblotting specific antibodies, N-terminal peptide sequencing. PSD fraction enriched spectrin, actin, tublin microtubule associated protein II, myosin, enzymes glycolysis, creatine kinase, elongation factor 1 alpha, receptor protein. three neurofilament proteins detected 58-kDa protein prominent is, peptide sequencing, bovine homolog recently cloned 66-kDa neurofilament protein; contrast latter, however, enriched cerebrum compared spinal cord. 68-kDa protein identified member hsp70/BiP family proteins. protein, designated dynamin, indicating putative role microtubule motor, identified major protein, found, however, greatly enriched particulate fraction, significantly denaturant detergent insoluble. protein designated N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor also detected. Thus, two proteins implicated vesicular transport present PSD fraction. Seven polyclonal antibodies produced 2DE separated electroeluted proteins PSD identified peptide sequence analysis 2DE profile hsp70/BiP homologous protein, novel neurofilament protein synapsin IIa, pyruvate kinase, dynamin, aconitase unknown contaminating protein, 115-kDa protein subcellular fractionation immunoblotting diagnostic PSD molecule. addition, peptide sequences obtained four additional higher molecular weight proteins PSD related level primary structure known proteins.
