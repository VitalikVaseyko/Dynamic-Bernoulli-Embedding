 Pollen germination pollen tube growth important physiological processes sexual reproduction plants also involved signal transduction. previous study reveals ZmSTK1 ZmSTK2 two receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCK) homologs Zea mays members receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) subfamily, sharing 86% identity amino acid level. Here, report ZmSTK1 ZmSTK2, expressed late stages pollen development, regulate maize pollen development additive effect. ZmSTK1 ZmSTK2 mutation exhibited severe pollen transmission deficiency, thus influenced pollen fertility. Moreover, kinase domains ZmSTKs cross-interacted C-terminus enolases detected co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H), respectively. Further, detective ZmSTK1 ZmSTK2 associated decreased activity enolases also reduced downstream metabolite contents, enolases involved glycolytic pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate, ADP/ATP, starch, glucose, sucrose fructose. study reveals ZmSTK1 ZmSTK2 regulate maize pollen development indirectly participate glycolytic pathway.
