 presence lactate dehydrogenase skeletal muscle mitochondria investigated clarify whether lactate possible substrate mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondria prepared 100 mg samples human mouse vastus lateralis muscle. fractions preparation procedure assayed marker enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). mitochondrial fraction contained LDH activity (detection limit approximately 0.05 % tissue activity) distribution LDH activity among fractions paralleled pyruvate kinase, i.e. LDH fractionated cytoplasmic enzyme. Respiratory experiments mitochondrial fraction also indicated absence LDH. Lactate cause respiration, affect respiration pyruvate + malate. major part native cytochrome c retained isolated mitochondria, which, furthermore, showed high specific rates state 3 respiration. excluded artificial loss mitochondria activity possible LDH. concluded skeletal muscle mitochondria devoid LDH unable metabolize lactate.
