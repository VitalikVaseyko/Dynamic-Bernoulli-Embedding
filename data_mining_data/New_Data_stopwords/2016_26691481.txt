 viability Lactobacillus bulgaricus freeze-drying significant commercial interest dairy industries. study, L.bulgaricus demonstrated significantly improved (p < 0.05) survival rate freeze-drying subjected pre-stressed period conditions 2% (w/v) NaCl 2 h late growth phase. main energy source life activity lactic acid bacteria related glycolytic pathway. investigate phenomenon stress-related viability improvement L. bulgaricus, activities corresponding genes key enzymes glycolysis 2% NaCl stress studied. NaCl stress significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) glucose utilization. activities glycolytic enzymes (phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase) decreased freeze-drying, NaCl stress found improve activities enzymes freeze-drying. However, transcriptional analysis corresponding genes suggested effect NaCl stress expression pfk2 gene obvious. increased survival freeze-dried cells L. bulgaricus NaCl stress might due changes activity translation level enzymes different environmental conditions relation mRNA transcription level.
