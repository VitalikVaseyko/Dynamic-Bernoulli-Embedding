 key hallmark cancer cells altered metabolism, known Warburg effect. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) executes final step aerobic glycolysis reported involved tumor progression. However, function LDHA prostate cancer studied. current study, observed overexpression LDHA clinical prostate cancer samples compared benign prostate hyperplasia tissues demonstrated immunohistochemistry real-time qPCR. Attenuated expression LDHA siRNA inhibition LDHA activities FX11 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, promoted cell apoptosis PC-3 DU145 cells. Mechanistically, decreased Warburg effect demonstrated reduced glucose consumption lactate secretion reduced expression MMP-9, PLAU, cathepsin B found LDHA knockdown FX11 treatment PC-3 DU145 cells. Taken together, study revealed oncogenic role LDHA prostate cancer suggested LDHA might potential therapeutic target.
