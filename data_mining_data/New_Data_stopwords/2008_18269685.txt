 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) linked chromosome 1q21-24 multiple samples, including Utah family sample. Variants 13 numerous candidate genes 1q region tested association T2D Utah case-control sample. promising, 19 variants 6 candidates, genotyped Utah family sample. Herein, tested 19 variants individually pairs effect T2D risk family members using logistic regression model accounted gender, age, BMI attributed residual genetic effects polygenic component. Seven variants increased risk significantly 5 pairs interactions. significant variant pairs apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2) rs6413453 interacting calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1) rs617698, dual specificity phosphatase 12 (DUSP12) rs1503814, retinoid X receptor gamma (RXRG) rs10918169, poly-T insertion-deletion polymorphism liver pyruvate kinase (PKLR) interacting APOA2 rs12143180, DUSP12 rs1027702 interacting RXRG rs10918169. Genotypes 5 variant pairs accounted 25.8% genetic variance T2D pedigrees.
