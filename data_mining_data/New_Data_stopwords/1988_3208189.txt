 Changes expression two isoenzymic forms pyruvate kinase fetal hepatocyte cultures derived 15- 19-day gestation rats studied immunocytochemical localization respective antigens. Initially, cultures established 15-day gestation rats 'embryonic' form enzyme (M2-PK) detected cells. Cells stain positively liver specific form enzyme (L-PK) observed. 2 days' culture, significant number cells become positive L-PK. positive cells morphology typical liver parenchymal cells. However, majority parenchymal cells remain negative L-PK retaining M2-PK. contrast, cells display fibroblastic morphology, well clear epithelial cells M2-PK positive, L-PK negative. 5-day-old cultures, hepatocytes become L-PK positive. Hepatocytes derived 19-day gestation rat liver stain positively L-PK day 1 culture agreement previously published biochemical data. minor population negative cells non-parenchymal appearance. parenchymal cells negative culture stained M2-PK specific antibody. Five days culture established, many non-parenchymal cells present. cells L-PK negative M2-PK positive presence cultures derived 15- 19-day gestation rats explains persistence M2-PK. study reveals enzymic differentiation fetal hepatocytes, immature hepatocytes initially capable expressing M2-PK produce L-PK. culture, sub-population cells initiates synthesis L-PK, indicating fraction cells differentiate. time, hepatocytes stain M2-PK appear, suggests cells initiate L-PK synthesis ceased make M2-PK. Eventually hepatocytes L-PK positive M2-PK negative, indicating switchover expression pyruvate kinase isoenzymes occurred.
