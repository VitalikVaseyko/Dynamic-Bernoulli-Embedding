 humans levels activity alpha-subunit hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-alpha) regulated post-translation hydroxylation catalyzed iron- 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent prolyl asparaginyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3 factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH), respectively). One consequence hypoxia accumulation tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (TCAIs). vitro assays used assess non-2OG TCAIs inhibitors purified PHD2 FIH. assay conditions, significant FIH inhibition observed TCAIs pyruvate, fumarate, succinate, isocitrate inhibited PHD2. Mass spectrometric analyses nondenaturing conditions used investigate binding TCAIs PHD2 supported solution studies. X-ray crystal structures FIH complex Fe(II) fumarate succinate revealed similar binding modes 2OG co-substrate binding site. vitro results suggest cellular inhibition PHD2, probably FIH, fumarate succinate may play role Warburg effect providing appropriate relative concentrations components achieved physiological conditions.
