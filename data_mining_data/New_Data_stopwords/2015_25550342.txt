 greatest limitation reproductive performance mammals, including humans, embryonic mortality, which, general, claims 20%-40% embryos peri-implantation period pregnancy. arginine secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) multifunctional molecules increase significantly ovine uterine histotroph early pregnancy. However, little known relationship underlying mechanisms synergistic effects arginine SPP1, any, conceptus (embryo/fetus associated extraembryonic membranes) development. Therefore, conducted vitro experiments using established ovine trophectoderm cell line (oTr1) isolated Day 15 ovine conceptuses determine proliferative response individual synergistic effects arginine recombinant SPP1 (rSPP1) contains RGD binding sequence. physiological concentrations, arginine (0.2 mM) stimulated oTr1 cell proliferation 1.7-fold (P < 0.05) 48 h, whereas rSPP1 (10 ng/ml) effect. However, additive effect oTr1 cell proliferation induced combination arginine SPP1 compared control (2.1-fold increase; P < 0.01), arginine alone (1.3-fold increase; P < 0.05), rSPP1 alone (1.5-fold increase; P < 0.01). additive effect mediated cooperative activation PDK1-Akt/PKB-TSC2-MTORC1 cell signaling cascade. Collectively, results suggest arginine SPP1 histotroph act cooperatively enhance survival, growth, development ovine conceptuses.
