 Tamoxifen resistance often observed majority estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers remains serious clinical problem breast cancer management. Increased aerobic glycolysis proposed one mechanisms acquired resistance chemotherapeutic agents breast cancer cells adriamycin. Herein, report glycolysis rates LCC2 LCC9--tamoxifen-resistant human breast cancer cell lines derived MCF7--are higher MCF7S, parent MCF7 subline. Inhibition key glycolytic enzyme hexokinase-2 resulted cell growth retardation higher degree LCC2 LCC9 MCF7S. implies increased aerobic glycolysis even O2-rich conditions, phenomenon known Warburg effect, closely associated tamoxifen resistance. found HIF-1alpha activated via Akt/mTOR signaling pathway LCC2 LCC9 cells without hypoxic condition. Importantly, specific inhibition hexokinase-2 suppressed activity Akt/mTOR/HIF-1alpha axis LCC2 LCC9 cells. addition, phosphorylated AMPK negative regulator mTOR decreased LCC2 LCC9 cells compared MCF7S. Interestingly, either inhibition mTOR activity increase AMPK activity induced reduction lactate accumulation cell survival LCC2 LCC9 cells. Taken together, data provide evidence development tamoxifen resistance may driven HIF-1alpha hyperactivation via modulation Akt/mTOR and/or AMPK signaling pathways. Therefore, suggest HIF-1alpha hyperactivation critical marker increased aerobic glycolysis accordance tamoxifen resistance thus restoration aerobic glycolysis may novel therapeutic target treatment tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.
