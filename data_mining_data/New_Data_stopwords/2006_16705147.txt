 Previously, showed oxidant exposure renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) induces mitochondrial dysfunction mediated PKC-epsilon. study examined role ERK1/2 mitochondrial dysfunction induced oxidant injury whether PKC-epsilon mediates effects mitochondrial function Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. Sublethal injury produced tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) resulted three- fivefold increase phosphorylation ERK1/2 p38 JNK. followed decreases basal uncoupled respirations (41%), state 3 respiration ATP production coupled complex (46%), complex activity (42%). Oxidant exposure decreased aconitase activity 30% pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate dehydrogenase activities. Inhibition ERK1/2 restored basal state 3 respirations, DeltaPsi(m), ATP production, complex activity aconitase activity. contrast, activation ERK1/2 expression constitutively active MEK1 suppressed basal, uncoupled, state 3 respirations noninjured RPTC levels observed TBHP-injured RPTC. MEK1/2 inhibition change Akt p38 phosphorylation, demonstrating protective effect MEK1/2 inhibitor due activation Akt inhibition p38 pathway. Inhibition PKC-epsilon block TBHP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation whole RPTC mitochondria. conclude 1) oxidant-induced activation ERK1/2 p38 JNK reduces mitochondrial respiration ATP production decreasing complex activity substrate oxidation complex I, 2) citric acid cycle dehydrogenases control ERK1/2 pathway oxidant-injured RPTC, 3) protective effects ERK1/2 inhibition due activation Akt, 4) ERK1/2 PKC-epsilon mediate oxidant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction independent pathways.
