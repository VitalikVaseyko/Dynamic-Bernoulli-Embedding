 Gene expression data obtained mouse heart indicate increased expression nuclear receptor, peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), prompts postnatal transition predominantly carbohydrate fatty acid oxidation preference. However, phenotypic proteomic data available confirm downstream signaling metabolic transition mice. studied hypothesis shifts nuclear receptor expression trigger newborn metabolic switch newborn sheep. species well characterized regards developmental changes substrate oxidative metabolism. Heart tissues fetal (130 days gestation), newborn </=24 hours, 30-day old lambs evaluated protein expression multiple enzymes controlling oxidative metabolism well principal nuclear receptors coactivators. Although muscle liver type carnitine palmitoyl transferases showed significant changes correspond metabolic transition, hexokinase II protein content showed profound transient drop, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase steadily increased. PPARalpha showed increases preceding transition, peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) increased approximately 20-fold transiently newborn heart conjunction significant increases thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 retinoid-activated receptor alpha. data challenge paradigm increases PPARalpha prompt postnatal metabolic switch, suggest nuclear receptors play major role. thyroid hormone (TH) modulates PGC-1 expression sheep development, data suggest well-characterized perinatal TH surge sheep contributes metabolic switch.
