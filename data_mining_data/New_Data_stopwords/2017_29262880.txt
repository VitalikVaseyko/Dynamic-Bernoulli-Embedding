 OBJECTIVE: investigate metabolism characteristics, search potential biomarkers associated disease explore related metabolic pathways analyzing plasma metabolic profile patients chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) metabolomies. METHODS: Twenty-six newly diagnosed CML patients First Affilated Hospital Soochow University February 2015 April 2015, 26 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell donors healthy controls 26 patients treated tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) obtain best efficacy post-treatment controls enrolled study. metabolites plasma extracted Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer(GC-MS) collect metabolic fingerprint. Multivariate pattern recognition analysis test combined screen metabolic biomarkers different time points. receiver operating characteristic curve analysis used evaluate clinical efficacy metabolites, metabolic pathway analysis performed. RESULTS: Significantly different metabolite expression mode found seen CML healthy control groups. Six changed metabolites CML confirmed multivariate variate statistical analyses. Compared healthy controls, levels tetradecanoic acid glycerol decreased, lactic acid, myo-inositol, d-galactose glycine CML patients also increased (all VIP>1,P<0.05, AUC>0.7). plasma metabolites CML patients treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) showed recovery trend toward normal levels. plasma metabolic pathways CML mainly related galactose, pyruvate, glycerolipid, inositol phosphate glycine, serine threonine metabolism (all impact value>0.10). CONCLUSION: Significant changes plasma metabolite levels found CML patients. Metabolomics combined multivariate pattern recognition analysis may new tool assist diagnosis.
