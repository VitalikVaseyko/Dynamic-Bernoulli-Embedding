 Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) essential, highly conserved component glycolysis. Tumors often dependent glycolysis energy metabolite production (the Warburg effect). Glycolysis inhibitors thus show promise cancer treatments. TIM inhibition, unlike inhibition glycolysis enzymes, also produces toxic methylglyoxal targeted regions high glycolysis, effect might also therapeutically useful. Thus TIM attractive drug target. total 338,562 lead-like molecules analyzed computationally find TIM inhibitors efficient "double screen" approach. first fragment-sized compounds studied using structure-based virtual screening identify binding motifs mammalian TIM. Subsequently, larger compounds, filtered meet binding criteria developed first analysis, ranked using second round structure-based virtual screening. compound found inhibited mammalian TIM vitro micromolar range. Docking molecular dynamics (MD) suggested inhibitor made hydrogen bond contacts TIM catalytic residues. addition, hydrophobic contacts made throughout binding site. predicted inhibitor-TIM interactions involved TIM residues highly conserved. discovered compound may provide scaffold elaboration inhibitors.
