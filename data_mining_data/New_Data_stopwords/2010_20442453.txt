 Caveolin-1 (-/-) null stromal cells novel genetic model cancer-associated fibroblasts myofibroblasts. Here, used unbiased informatics analysis transcriptional gene profiling show Cav-1 (-/-) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear striking resemblance activated tumor stroma human breast cancers. specifically, transcriptional profiles Cav-1 (-/-) stromal cells closely related primary tumor stroma breast cancer patients undergone lymph-node (LN) metastasis. consistent previous morphological data demonstrating loss stromal Cav-1 protein (by immuno-histochemical staining fibroblast compartment) significantly associated increased LN-metastasis. also provide evidence tumor stroma human breast cancers shows transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair, inflammation, hypoxia, aerobic glycolysis, consistent "Reverse Warburg Effect". Finally, tumor stroma "metastasis-prone" breast cancer patients closely related transcriptional profiles derived brains patients Alzheimer's disease. suggests certain fundamental biological processes common activated tumor stroma neuro-degenerative stress. processes may include oxidative stress, over-production (peroxynitrite formation), inflammation, hypoxia, mitochondrial dysfunction, thought occur Alzheimer?s disease pathology. Thus, loss Cav-1 expression cancer-associated myofibroblasts may protein biomarker oxidative stress, aerobic glycolysis, inflammation, driving "Reverse Warburg Effect" tumor micro-environment cancer cell metastasis.
