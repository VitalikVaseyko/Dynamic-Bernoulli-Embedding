 1. renaturation Neurospora pyruvate kinase following denaturation urea investigated. 2. substrates, phosphoenol pyruvate adenosine diphosphate, observed stabilize enzyme urea-induced structural disorganization. 3. demonstrated refolding/reactivation denatured protein allosteric activator, fructose-1,6-diphosphate sulphydryl protectant required. 4. enzyme recovered following renaturation showed complete immunological identity native enzyme Ouchterlony double diffusion tests.
