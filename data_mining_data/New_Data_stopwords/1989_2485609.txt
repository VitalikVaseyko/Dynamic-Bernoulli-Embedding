 aim study determine changes basic parameters erythrocyte system activity red blood cell (RBC) enzymes prior single physical effort leading exhaustion. study carried male Wistar rats subjected running electric rotating drum speed 25 m/min. single exercise caused decrease RBC count, haemoglobin concentration (Hb) haematocrit (Hct) 21.9, 16.7 16.1%, respectively, increase reticulocyte count (Ret) 661.5%. exercise triggered also changes activities erythrocytic enzymes: pyruvate kinase (PK) activity increased 12.4%, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 37.8%, glutathione reductase (GR) 30.8% acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 248.7%. increases activities RBC enzymes explained increase red cells turn-over.
