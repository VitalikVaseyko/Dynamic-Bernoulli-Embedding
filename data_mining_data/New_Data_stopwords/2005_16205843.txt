 accumulation proliferation vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) within vessel wall important pathogenic feature development atherosclerosis. Glucose metabolism implicated play important role cellular mechanism. elucidate role glucose metabolism atherogenesis, glycolysis regulation investigated proliferating VSMC. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF BB)-induced proliferation VSMCs significantly stimulated glucose flux glycolysis. evaluating enzymatic regulation pathway, analysis flux:metabolite co-responses revealed anaerobic glycolytic flux controlled different sites gycolysis proliferating VSMCs, consistent concept multisite modulation. findings indicate regulation glycolytic flux proliferating VSMCs differs traditional concepts metabolic control Embden-Meyerhof pathway.
