 role central leptin regulating heart lipid accumulation lean leptin-sensitive animals fully elucidated. Herein, investigated effects central leptin infusion expression genes involved cardiac metabolism role control myocardial triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation adult Wistar rats. Intracerebroventricular (icv) leptin infusion (0.2 microg/day) 7 days markedly decreased TAG levels cardiac tissue. Remarkably, cardiac anti-steatotic effects central leptin associated selective upregulation gene protein expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta, encoded Pparb/d) target genes, adipose triglyceride lipase (encoded Pnpla2, herefater referred Atgl), hormone sensitive lipase (encoded Lipe, herefater referred Hsl), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) acyl CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), involved myocardial intracellular lipolysis mitochondrial/peroxisomal fatty acid utilization. Besides, central leptin decreased expression stearoyl-CoA deaturase 1 (Scd1) diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1) involved TAG synthesis increased CPT-1 independent palmitate oxidation, index peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Finally, pharmacological inhibition PPARbeta/delta decreased effects gene expression cardiac TAG content induced leptin. results indicate leptin, acting central level, regulates selectively cardiac expression PPARbeta/delta, contributing way regulate cardiac TAG accumulation rats, independently effects body weight.
