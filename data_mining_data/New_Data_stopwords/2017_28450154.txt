 Phenyl butyrate (PB) proved decrease pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation level increase PDH activity inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) fibroblast cells, PDH deficiency zebrafish wild type mice. PB also shown efficacy many cancers far, anti-tumor activity attributed histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. PDK1/PDH controls critical switch oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis cancer cells, PDK1 key target tumor metabolism anti-cancer treatment. hypothesize therapeutic effects PB cancers might also depend suppressing PDK1 promoting PDH activity, addition proposed role HDAC inhibitor. showed PB directly inhibited kinase activity PDK1 increased activity PDH enzyme assay. several different cancer cell lines, PB reduced phosphorylation level PDH, increased mitochondrial respiration, decreased glycolysis cytoplasm, reversed mitochondrial hyperpolarization, activated several proteins apoptotic signaling pathway induced apoptosis cells. summary, first study indicated PB could exert anti-cancer effects inhibiting PDK1, altering mitochondrial bioenergetics inducing apoptosis.
