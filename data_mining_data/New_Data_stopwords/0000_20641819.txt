 pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP) peptide 37 amino acids inserts across cell membrane alpha-helix extracellular pH (pHe) acidic (1-4). pHLIP labeled near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent marker Cy5.5 (pHLIP-Cy5.5) developed Andreev et al. optical mapping areas (tumor arthritis) elevated acidity small animals (1). Tumor microenvironment characterized low pHe (5, 6). Almost solid tumors neutral alkaline intracellular pH (pHi), develop acidic pHe (known Warburg effect, Nobel Prize 1931). average pHe could low 6.0 (7-9). pH gradient (pHi > pHe) exists across cell membrane tumors. gradient contrary found normal tissues, pHi lower pHe (7.2-7.4) (7-9). Diffusion H(+) ions along concentration gradients tumors adjacent normal tissues creates peritumoral acid gradient (10). mechanisms responsible low pHe include anaerobic glycolysis hypoxia, aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), increased metabolic CO2 production associated uncontrolled cell growth, increased activity ion pumps cell membrane (5, 7). Low pHe affects many aspects tumor physiology. one driving forces clonal selection leading invasive metastatic diseases (11, 12). Rofstad et al. shown lowering culture pH 6.8 results promotion vivo metastasis treated human melanoma cells compared controls (cultured pH 7.4) tail vein injection cells mice (13). Exposure tumor cells acidic environment leads increased expression various factors contribute tumor progression (12). Tumor cells able maintain high proliferation rate acidic environment, whereas peritumoral acid gradient limits immune response tumor antigens induces normal cell apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis (7, 11). passage noncarrier-mediated weak drugs cell membranes also influenced acidic pHe (14-16). Typically, drugs uncharged state (lipophilic form) pass efficiently cell membranes. leads hypothesis 'ion-trapping' weakly basic drugs concentrate acidic compartments (14, 15). acid pHe tumors therefore hinder weakly basic drugs reaching intracellular targets, thereby reducing cytotoxicity (16). Conversely, acid pHe tumors improve uptake weak acids relatively neutral intracellular space (17). currently used chemotherapeutic drugs mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, anthracyclines, anthraquinones vinca alkaloids weak bases (pKa 5.5-6.8), cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil chlorambucil weak acids (pKa 7.8-8.8) (15). vitro vivo studies shown activities weak bases inhibited low pHe (14-16). contrary, actions weak acids enhanced low pHe. pH gradient tumors exerts protective effect upon cells weak-base drugs well acts potentiate action weak acid drugs (17). Studies consistently shown selective tumor alkalinization vivo likely result enhancement anti-tumor activity weakly basic chemotherapeutic drugs (18, 19). Low pHe also shown impair effectiveness drugs paclitaxel chemical structures predict pH-dependent ionization (7). addition, radiation therapies known significantly less effective hypoxic acidic regions tumor (20). understanding mechanisms involved tumor-specific low pHe leads development targeted therapeutic approaches (6, 7). Low pHe also considered promising marker tumor targeting detection (4, 8). pHLIP interacts surface membranes unstructured peptide neutral pHe, acidic pHe (<7.0) inserts across membrane forms stable transmembrane alpha-helix (1, 2, 21, 22). pHLIP affinity membranes low pH (5.0) 20 times higher high pH (8.0). Studies Zoonens et al. showed pHLIP could translocate cell-impermeable cargo molecules across cell membrane release cytoplasm (23). process mediated formation transmembrane alpha-helix increased peptide hydrophobicity associated protonation Asp residues low pH (1, 22). Replacement two key Asp residues located transmembrane part pHLIP Lys Asn leads loss pH-sensitive membrane insertion (3). Andreev et al. labeled pHLIP Cy5.5 tested feasibility optical mapping tumor arthritis characterized elevated acidity (1). Optical fluorescence imaging increasingly used monitor biological functions specific targets small animals (24-26). However, intrinsic fluorescence biomolecules poses problem fluorophores absorb visible light used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence detection avoids natural background fluorescence interference biomolecules, providing high contrast target background tissues small animals. NIR fluorophores wider dynamic range minimal background fluorescence result reduced scattering compared visible fluorescence detection. NIR fluorophores also high sensitivity, attributable low background fluorescence, high extinction coefficients, provide high quantum yields. NIR region also compatible solid-state optical components, diode lasers silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging non-invasive alternative radionuclide imaging small animals (27, 28).
