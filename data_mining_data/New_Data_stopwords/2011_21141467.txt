 OBJECTIVE: order optimize precursor supply L-tryptophan biosynthesis, Corynebacterium pekinense PD-67 mutant phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene (ppc) in-frame deletion constructed. effect ppc knock-out physiological characteristics mutant investigated. METHODS: upstream downstream fragments ppc cloned C. pekinense PD-67 chromosome ligated integration vector. mutant C. pekinense PD-67-deltappc screened homologous recombination. physiological characteristics mutant investigated fermentation experiments measurement pyruvate carboxylase (PCx) pyruvate kinase (PK). RESULTS: mutant ppc gene in-frame deletion screened confirmed PCR check phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase determination. mutant exhibited slow growth less cell mass, 80% much parent strain. ppc knock-out resulted decrease L-tryptophan accumulation overproduction pyruvate-related amino acids, accompanied increase PK activity decrease PCx activity, C. pekinense PD-67. CONCLUSION: knock-out ppc gene affected metabolism strain extent. blocking anaplerotic pathway PEPCx participated insufficient increase accumulation L-tryptophan C. pekinense PD-67.
