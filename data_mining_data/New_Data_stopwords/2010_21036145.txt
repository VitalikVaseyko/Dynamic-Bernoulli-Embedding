 Signal transducers activators transcription (STATs) first identified key signaling molecules response cytokines. Constitutive STAT activation also widely implicated oncogenesis. analyzed STAT5-associated proteins leukemic cell line LSTRA, exhibits constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activation STAT5. cellular protein found specifically interact STAT5 LSTRA cells co-immunoprecipitation. Sequencing analysis subsequent immunoblotting confirmed identity STAT5-associated protein E2 component mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2). Consistent interaction, subcellular fractionation immunofluorescence microscopy revealed mitochondrial localization STAT5 LSTRA cells. Mitochondrial localization tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 also occurred cytokine-stimulated cells. time course experiment demonstrated transient kinetics STAT5 mitochondrial translocation cytokine stimulation. contrast, cytokine-induced STAT1 STAT3 activation result translocation mitochondria. Furthermore, showed mitochondrial STAT5 bound D-loop regulatory region mitochondrial DNA vitro. suggests potential role STAT5 regulating mitochondrial genome. Proliferative metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis well known cancer cells Warburg effect also observed cytokine-stimulated cells. novel findings cytokine-induced STAT5 translocation mitochondria link oncogenesis provide important insights underlying mechanisms characteristic metabolic shift.
