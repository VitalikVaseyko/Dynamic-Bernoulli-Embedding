 regulation neuroendocrine electrical activity gene expression glucose mediated several distinct metabolic pathways. Many studies implicated AMP ATP key metabolites mediating neuroendocrine responses glucose, especially effects AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), studies suggested glycolysis, particular cytoplasmic conversion nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) reduced NAD (NADH), may play important role oxidative phosphorylation effects glucose. address molecular mechanisms further, examined regulation agouti-related peptide (AgRP) clonal hypothalamic cell line, N-38. AgRP expression induced monotonically glucose concentrations decreased 10 0.5 mm glucose increasing concentrations glycolytic inhibitors. However, neither pyruvate 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate mimicked effect glucose reduce AgRP mRNA, contrary, produced opposite effect glucose actually increased AgRP mRNA. Nevertheless, 3beta-hydroxybutyrate mimicked effect glucose increase ATP decrease AMPK phosphorylation. Similarly, inhibition AMPK RNA interference increased, activation AMPK decreased, AgRP mRNA. Additional studies demonstrated neither hexosamine pentose/carbohydrate response element-binding protein pathways mediate effects glucose AgRP expression. studies support either ATP AMPK mediate effects glucose AgRP hypothalamic cell line support role glycolysis and, particular, NADH. studies support cytoplasmic nuclear NADH, uniquely produced glucose metabolism, mediates effects glucose AgRP expression.
