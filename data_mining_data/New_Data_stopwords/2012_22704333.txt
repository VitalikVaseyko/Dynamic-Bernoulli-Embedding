 UNLABELLED: Fermentation glucose lactate presence sufficient oxygen, known aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect, universal phenotype cancer cells. Understanding origin role cellular immortalization transformation attracted considerable attention recent past. Intriguingly, know Warburg effect essential tumor growth development, thought arise genetic and/or epigenetic changes. contrast above, propose Warburg effect also arise due normal biochemical fluctuations, independent genetic epigenetic changes. Cells acquired Warburg effect proliferate rapidly give rise population heterogeneous progenitors cancer cells. cells also generate lactate alter fitness landscape. dynamic fitness landscape facilitates evolution cancer cells progenitors, fashion analogous Darwinian evolution. Thus, sporadic cancer also occur first acquisition Warburg effect, followed mutation selection. idea proposed circumvents inherent difficulties associated current understanding tumorigenesis, also consistent many experimental epidemiological observations. discuss model context epigenetics originally enunciated Waddington.
