 study investigation focuses vitro antiproliferative efficacy flavonoid morin mechanisms inhibits growth colon cancer using SW480 colon cancer cells emphasis Warburg effect. found cell proliferation significantly inhibited morin dose time dependent manner. Morin induced apoptosis correlated increased levels reactive oxygen species formation loss mitochondrial membrane potential cells. addition, increase cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, cleaved caspase 9 Bax well decrease Bcl 2 observed, indicating morin inducing intrinsic well extrinsic pathway apoptosis. confirmed using downstream caspase 3 inhibitor indicated caspase 3 inhibition reduces morin induced cell death. Moreover, impact morin energy status determined terms total cellular ATP level showed decline low level glucose uptake Glut1 expression. results indicate morin exerts antiproliferative activity inducing apoptosis reducing Warburg effect evaluated cell lines provide preliminary evidence anticancer activity.
