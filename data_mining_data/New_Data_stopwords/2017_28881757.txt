 aim study investigate mechanism cadmium-induced apoptosis chicken spleens antagonistic effects selenium. duplicated selenium-cadmium interaction model examined expression apoptosis-, immune-, mitochondrial dynamics- energy metabolism-related genes. results demonstrated treatment cadmium, frequency apoptosis significantly increased, morphological characteristics apoptosis observed. expression pro-apoptotic genes increased, anti-apoptotic genes decreased. mRNA levels tumor necrosis factor-alpha interlenkin-1beta observably increased, interlenkin-2 interferon-gamma levels markedly decreased. Furthermore, mRNA protein levels dynamin-related protein 1 mitochondrial fission factor significantly enhanced, whereas mitofusin 1, mitofusin 2, optic atrophy 1 markedly decreased. expression hexokinase 1, hexokinase 2, aconitase 2, lactate dehydrogenase A, lactate dehydrogenase B, succinatedehydrogenase B, pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase also reduced. Selenium supplements remarkably attenuated cadmium-induced effects (p < 0.05). Based results, conclude cadmium treatment promoted mitochondrial dynamic imbalance reduced energy metabolism, leading apoptosis immune dysfunction chicken spleens, selenium antagonistic effect Cd-induced apoptosis.
