 alpha-enolase (ENOA) metabolic enzyme involved synthesis pyruvate. also acts plasminogen receptor thus mediates activation plasmin extracellular matrix degradation. tumor cells, EpsilonNuOmicronAlpha upregulated supports anaerobic proliferation (Warburg effect), expressed cell surface, promotes cancer invasion, subjected specific array post-translational modifications, namely acetylation, methylation phosphorylation. ENOA overexpression post-translational modifications could diagnostic prognostic value cancer. review discuss recent information biochemical, proteomics immunological characterization ENOA, particularly ability trigger specific humoral cellular immune response. opinion, information pave way effective new therapeutic diagnostic strategies counteract growth aggressive human disease.
