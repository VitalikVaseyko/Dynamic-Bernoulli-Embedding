 present studies aimed analysis expression level genes PKM2 CAST Longissimus lumborum [LL] muscle tissue pigs differing regards glycolytic potential [GP] drip loss [DL] muscle, reference genetic group. studies covered total 65 pigs: 20 purebred Landrace [L], 22 crossbreeds Landrace Yorkshire [L x Y] 23 three-breed crosses (Landrace x Yorkshire) x Duroc [(L x Y) x D]. case gene PKM2 one may observe (L x Y) x crossbreds, compared L x crossbreds, increased expression, closely related increase dry matter content, including intramuscular fat, well favourable progress glycolytic energy metabolism early time post mortem (pH(45) R(1)). Compared Landrace animals, lower expression CAST gene observed (L x Y) x pigs manifested marked improvement meat quality (R(1) pH(45) pH(24), pH(48)), arising rate glycolytic energy metabolism, typical normal meat, effect results higher culinary technological value.
