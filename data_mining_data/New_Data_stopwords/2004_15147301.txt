 Adenosine important regulator neuronal excitability. Zaprinast cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor, shown hippocampal slice suppress excitation. action blocked adenosine receptor antagonist, therefore presumably due adenosine release stimulated exposure zaprinast. explore mechanism phenomenon further, examined effect zaprinast adenosine release cultured rat forebrain neurons. Zaprinast significantly stimulated extracellular adenosine accumulation. effect zaprinast adenosine appeared mediated increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activation protein kinase (PKA): (i) zaprinast stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation; (ii) cAMP antagonist (Rp-8-Br-cAMP) significantly reduced zaprinast effect adenosine; (iii) inhibitor phosphodiesterase (PDE)1 (vinpocetine) activator adenylate cyclase (forskolin) mimicked effect zaprinast adenosine. also found zaprinast effect adenosine astrocyte cultures, tetrodotoxin completely blocked zaprinast-evoked adenosine accumulation neuronal cultures, suggesting neuronal activity likely involved. Consistent dependence neuronal activity, NMDA receptor antagonists (MK-801 D-APV) removal extracellular glutamate glutamate-pyruvate transaminase blocked effect zaprinast. addition, zaprinast shown stimulate glutamate release. Thus, data suggest zaprinast-evoked adenosine accumulation likely mediated stimulation glutamate release cAMP- PKA-dependent mechanism, likely inhibition PDE1 neurons. Furthermore, regulation cAMP, either inhibiting cAMP-PDE activity stimulating adenylate cyclase activity, may play important role modulating neuronal excitability. data suggest existence homeostatic negative feedback loop increases neuronal activity damped release adenosine following activation glutamate receptors.
