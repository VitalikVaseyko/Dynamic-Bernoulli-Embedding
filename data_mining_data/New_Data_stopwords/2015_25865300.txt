 n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFAs) shown suppress lipid accumulation improve protein utilization grass carp; however, little known underlying molecular mechanism. Hence, analyzed hepatopancreas transcriptome grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) fed either lard oil (LO) fish oil (FO) diets. RNA-seq data showed 125 genes significantly up-regulated 107 significantly down-regulated FO group. Among them, 17 lipid metabolism related genes, 12 carbohydrate metabolism related genes, 34 protein metabolism related genes selected. Lipid metabolism related genes, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSVL),carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), up-regulated FO group. genes diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) down-regulated. Down-regulation glycolysis related genes, 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), added up-regulation gluconeogenesis related genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), suggests lower utilization carbohydrate FO group. Besides, dietary FO also influenced protein metabolism related genes, up-regulation genes involved digestion dietary protein, mRNA transcription, protein translation amino acid utilization, down-regulation genes involved mRNA degradation ubiquitination protein. Interestingly, up-regulation mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) down-regulation oxidative phosphorylation related genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 2 [COX4I2], HIG1 domain family member 1A [HIGD1A] cytochrome-b5 reductase [CYB5R]) suggest energy metabolism may also influenced dietary fatty acid composition. findings presented provide comprehensive understanding molecular mechanisms governing effects fish oil grass carp.
