 supernatant fraction, free plastids, prepared centrifugation Euglena gracilis used ascertain whether inhibition carbon dioxide fixation oxygen, known Warburg effect, entirely independent light-driven phase photosynthesis. fraction exhibited dark main features Warburg effect; namely, inverse relationship degree inhibition oxygen bicarbonate concentration, reversibility inhibition oxygen partial pressure lowered increase proportion 2-carbon compounds. proposed, therefore, inhibition oxygen manifest photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle independent photosynthetic electron transport phosphorylation.
