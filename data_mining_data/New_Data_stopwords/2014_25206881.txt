 investigate molecular mechanism underlying neuroprotective effect lithium cells, study, exposed SH-SY5Y cells 0.5 mmol/L lithium carbonate (Li2CO2) 25-50 weeks detected expression levels neurobiology related genes post-translational modifications stress proteins SH-SY5Y cells. cDNA arrays showed pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2) calmodulin 3 (CaM 3) expression levels significantly down-regulated, phosphatase protein PP2A expression lightly down-regulated, casein kinase II (CK2), threonine/tyrosine phosphatase 7 (PYST2), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) expression levels significantly up-regulated. Besides, western blot analysis stress proteins (HSP27, HSP70, GRP78 GRP94) showed over-expression two proteins: 105 kDa protein hyper-phosphorylated isoform GRP94, 108 kDa protein phosphorylated tetramer HSP27. results suggest neuroprotective effects lithium likely related gene expressions post-translational modifications proteins cited above.
