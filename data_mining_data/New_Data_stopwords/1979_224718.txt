 realistic metabolic model tricarboxylic acid cycle perfused rat heart constructed help explain sequence biochemical events regulating metabolism exogenous pyruvate following large increase work load. unchelated Mg2+ level important controlling factor. resulting mixture chelated unchelated nucleotides tribasic acids effected coordinated control citrate synthase, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinyl CoA synthetase, fumarase, nucleoside diphosphokinase, Mg2+-chelates generally substrates whereas unchelated species inhibitors. Succinate dehydrogenase largely controlled ubiquinone redox potential. fluxes alpha-ketoglutarate malate dehydrogenases largely dependent thepyridine nucleotide redox potential, succinyl CoA-to-CoASH ratio strongly affects former enzyme well. model predicts accumulation succinate transition higher work output.
