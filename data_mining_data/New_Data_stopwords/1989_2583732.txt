 Using data daughters known carriers age-paired controls, present method estimating mean variance creatine kinase (CK) pyruvate kinase (PK) pre-menarchal early adolescent Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) carriers. CK PK means variances estimated different age ranges; shown among DMD carriers levels enzymes decrease linearly age. discriminant analysis performed estimation biochemical risks favouring diagnosis heterozygosity possible young carriers. use method may also applicable X-linked conditions detection heterozygotes probabilistic.
