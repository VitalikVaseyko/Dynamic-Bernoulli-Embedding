 Alternative splicing pyruvate kinase gene involves choice mutually exclusive exons 9 10. Use exon 10 generate M2 isoform crucial aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) tumour growth. previously demonstrated splicing enhancer elements activate exon 10 mainly found exon 10 itself, deleting mutating elements increases inclusion exon 9 cancer cells. systematically search new enhancer elements exon 10 develop effective pharmacological method force switch PK-M2 PK-M1, carried antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) screen. found potent ASOs target novel enhancer exon 10 strongly switch splicing endogenous PK-M transcripts include exon 9. show ASO-mediated switch alternative splicing leads apoptosis glioblastoma cell lines, caused downregulation PK-M2, upregulation PK-M1. data highlight potential ASO-mediated inhibition PK-M2 splicing therapy cancer.
