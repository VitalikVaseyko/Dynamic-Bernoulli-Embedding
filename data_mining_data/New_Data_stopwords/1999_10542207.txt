 Zucker diabetic fatty rats develop type 2 diabetes concomitantly peripheral insulin resistance. Hepatocytes rats control lean counterparts cultured, number key parameters glucose metabolism determined. Glucokinase activity 4.5-fold lower hepatocytes diabetic rats hepatocytes healthy ones. contrast, hexokinase activity 2-fold higher hepatocytes diabetic animals healthy ones. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity significantly different. Despite altered ratios glucokinase hexokinase activity, intracellular glucose 6-phosphate concentrations similar two types cells incubated 1-25 mM glucose. However, glycogen levels glycogen synthase activity ratio lower hepatocytes diabetic animals. Total pyruvate kinase activity activity ratio well fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration lactate production also lower cells diabetic animals. data indicate glucose metabolism clearly impaired hepatocytes Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Glucokinase overexpression using adenovirus restored glucose metabolism diabetic hepatocytes. glucokinase-overexpressing cells, glucose 6-phosphate levels increased. Moreover, glycogen deposition greatly enhanced due activation glycogen synthase. Pyruvate kinase also activated, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate concentration lactate production increased glucokinase-overexpressing diabetic hepatocytes. Overexpression hexokinase increase glycogen deposition. conclusion, hepatocytes Zucker diabetic fatty rats showed depressed glycogen glycolytic metabolism, glucokinase overexpression improved glucose utilization storage.
