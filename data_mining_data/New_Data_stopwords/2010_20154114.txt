 fermentative metabolism Escherichia coli reengineered efficiently convert glycerol succinate anaerobic conditions without use foreign genes. Formate ethanol dominant fermentation products glycerol wild-type Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, followed succinate acetate. Inactivation pyruvate formate-lyase (pflB) wild-type strain eliminated production formate ethanol reduced production acetate. However, deletion slowed growth decreased cell yields due either insufficient energy production insufficient levels electron acceptors. Reversing direction gluconeogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction offered approach solve problems, conserving energy additional ATP increasing pool electron acceptors (fumarate malate). Recruiting enzyme promoter mutation (pck*) increase expression also increased rate growth, cell yield, succinate production. Presumably, high NADH/NAD(+) ratio served establish direction carbon flow. Additional mutations also beneficial. Glycerol dehydrogenase phosphotransferase-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase regarded primary route glycerol metabolism anaerobic conditions. However, true succinate production engineered strains. Deletion ptsI gene gene essential phosphotranferase system found increase succinate yield. Deletion pflB background provided increase succinate yield. Together, three core mutations (pck*, ptsI, pflB) effectively redirected carbon flow glycerol succinate 80% maximum theoretical yield anaerobic fermentation mineral salts medium.
