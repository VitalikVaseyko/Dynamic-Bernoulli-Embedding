 Pyruvate kinase (PK) moderate thermophile, Bacillus stearothermophilus (BstPK), allosteric enzyme activated AMP ribose 5-phosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). However, almost PKs activated FBP. wild-type W416F/V435W mutant BstPKs crystallized hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. However, unsuitable structural analysis data sets exhibited low completeness. crystal suitable structural analysis obtained using C9S/C268S enzyme. crystal belonged space group P6(2)22, unit-cell parameters = b = 145.97, c = 118.03 A.
