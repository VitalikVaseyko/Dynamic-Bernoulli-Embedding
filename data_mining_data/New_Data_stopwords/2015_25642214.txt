 two-component regulatory system (TCS) CiaRH Streptococcus pneumoniae implicated competence, ss-lactam resistance, maintenance cell integrity, bacteriocin production, host colonization, virulence. Depending growth conditions, CiaR highly active absence cognate kinase CiaH, although phosphorylation CiaR required DNA binding gene regulation. test possibility acetyl phosphate (AcP) could alternative phosphodonor, genes involved pyruvate metabolism disrupted alter cellular levels acetyl phosphate. Inactivating genes pyruvate oxidase SpxB, phosphotransacetylase Pta, acetate kinase AckA, resulted low AcP levels strongly reduced CiaR-mediated gene expression CiaH-deficient strains. Therefore, alternative phosphorylation CiaR appears proceed via AcP. AcP effect CiaR detected strains CiaH. Attempts obtain elevated AcP preventing degradation acetate kinase AckA, successful CiaH-deficient strains functional SpxB, important enzyme AcP production S. pneumoniae. ciaH-spxB-ackA mutant producing intermediate amounts AcP could constructed showed promoter activation, much higher expected. Since activation dependent AcP, apparently used efficiently CiaR phosphorylation absence AckA. Therefore, high AcP levels absence CiaH AckA may cause extreme overexpression CiaR regulon leading synthetic lethality. AckA also involved regulatory response, mediated CiaH. Addition acetate growth medium switch CiaH kinase phosphatase. switch lost absence AckA indicating metabolism acetate required, starts production AcP AckA. Therefore, AckA plays special regulatory role control CiaRH TCS.
