 Skeletal muscle plastic tissue development distinctive acute chronic response maternal protein restriction. study evaluated gene protein expression key-enzymes glycolytic pathway (HK2, PFK, PDK4 CS), fatty acid oxidation (CPT1 beta-HAD) two different types skeletal muscle [soleus extensor digitorium longus (EDL)] offspring rats 30 90 days age, exposed maternal isoenergetic low protein diet throughout gestation lactation. Pups dams fed 17% protein diet (n=5, normal protein, Np), low protein pups dams fed 8% casein diet (low protein, Lp, n=5) evaluated. Offspring sacrificed either 30 90 days old. Soleus EDL analyzed mRNA protein expression quantitative PCR western blotting, respectively. Soleus affected Lp maternal diet 90 days down-regulation key enzymes glycolytic pathway, particular HK2 PDK4 concomitant reduction beta-HAD mRNA. EDL, effects Lp maternal diet pronounced 30 days, transcriptional key enzymes glycolytic pathway down-regulated. One important finding observed acute (30 days) transcriptional changes remain adult Lp rats (90 days), except PDK4. robust PDK4 mRNA down-regulation, observed soleus EDL, ages, consequent down-regulation PDK4 protein expression responsible state reduced metabolic flexibility skeletal muscle response maternal low protein diet.
