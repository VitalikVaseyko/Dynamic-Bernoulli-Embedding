 Whereas alpha-tocopheryl acetate (alpha-TA) stereoisomers frequently compared various vitamin E tests, little studies made free alpha-tocopherols. reason, comparative tests alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOH) stereoisomers made means resorption-gestation method, individually also USP standard all-rac-alpha-TA. tests, parameter resorption-gestation supplemented determination pyruvate kinase (PK) activity well measurement vitamin E level liver. Quantitative statistical evaluation results made weighted probit analysis symmetrical parallel line assays. Comparison all-rac-alpha-TOH (dl-alpha-TOH) RRR-alpha-TOH (d-alpha-TOH) resorption-gestation test revealed activity ratio 1:1.38. Compared 2-ambo-alpha-TOH, RRR-alpha-TOH active factor 1.34 (resorption-gestation) 1.45 (myopathy). account great importance practice, comparison RRR-alpha-TOH USP standard repeated three times. parameters resorption-gestation myopathy, mean activities weight basis 0.69 0.74, respectively, measured. results fail confirm established activity 1 mg RRR-alpha-TOH = 1.49 USP units. vitamin E activity given alpha-tocopherol equivalents (alpha-TE), values referred RRR-alpha-TOH calculation made reciprocals. Depending parameter used, activity 1 mg all-rac-alpha-TA equivalent 1.45 alpha-TE (resorption-gestation) 1.35 alpha-TE (myopathy) thus noticeably higher established value 0.67 alpha-TE. first time, three parameters determined simultaneously comparison all-rac-alpha-TOH USP standard. Quantitative evaluation yielded following activities: Resorption-gestation, 0.52; Myopathy, 0.63; liver storage, 0.68. currently accepted value 1.10 USP units 1 mg all-rac-alpha-TOH thus even reached approximately. light experimental findings well laboratories, activities alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers expressed USP units esters expressed alpha-tocopherol equivalents need corrected.
