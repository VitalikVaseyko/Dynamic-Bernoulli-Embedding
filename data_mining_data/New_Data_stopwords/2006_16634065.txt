 Oxidative stress implicated pathophysiology number diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative disorder associated cognitive decline enhanced oxidative stress. Amyloid-beta peptide(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)), one main component senile plaques, induce vitro vivo oxidative damage neuronal cells ability produce free radicals. aim study investigate protective effect xanthate D609 Abeta(1-42)-induced protein oxidation using redox proteomics approach. D609 recently found free radical scavenger antioxidant. present study, rat primary neuronal cells pretreated 50 microM D609, followed incubation 10 microM Abeta(1-42) 24 hr. cells treated Abeta(1-42) alone, four proteins significantly oxidized identified: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase, 14-3-3 zeta. Pretreatment neuronal cultures D609 prior Abeta(1-42) protected identified oxidized proteins present study Abeta(1-42)-mediated protein oxidation. Therefore, D609 may ameliorate Abeta(1-42)-induced oxidative modification. discuss implications Abeta(1-42)-mediated oxidatively modified proteins AD pathology potential therapeutic intervention dementing disorder.
