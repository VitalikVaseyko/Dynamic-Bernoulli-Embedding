 (1) reduction pyruvate lactate studied isolated liver cells order elucidate mechanims involved transfer reducing equivalents mitochondria cytosol. (2) Manipulation cytosolic oxaloacetate concentration support malate-oxaloacetate cycle responsible transfer reducing equivalents mitochondria: (a) pyruvate plus oleate present 2 mM Amytal caused 10-fold decrease oxaloacetate concentration, small inhibitory effect lactate production. Oleate essential order prevent disintegration cells presence Amytal. (b) Quinolinate, inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (GTP: oxaloacetate carboxylyase, transphosphorylating, EC 4.1.1.32), caused several-fold increase oxaloacetate concentration inhibited lactate production pyruvate; accompanied increased reduction mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides. (3) p-Chlorophenyl pyruvate, inhibitor pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate: carbondioxide ligase, ADP, EC 6.4.1.1), also inhibited lactate production pyruvate. (4) postulated pyruvate substrate, recycling carbon via pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) important, energy-requiring, mechanism transfer proportion NADH directly associated gluconeogenesis.
