 Cancer cells consume large amounts glucose produce lactate, even presence ample oxygen. phenomenon known Warburg effect. pyruvate kinase promotes aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) highly expressed many cancer cells. Although Warburg effect hallmark cancer, mechanism PKM2 contributes Warburg effect, role tumor growth remain defined. proposed PKM2 activates transcription hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) phosphorylating STAT3 (signal transducer activator transcription 3) Y705 (tyrosine 705) plausible mechanism liver cancer cell proliferation. current study, observed PKM2 over-expressed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared adjacent normal tissues. experiments indicate nuclear PKM2 active protein kinase cultured cells. Knockdown PKM2 affected levels HIF-1alpha Bcl-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large), suggesting PKM2 plays important role promoting cell proliferation. conclusion, current findings demonstrate PKM2 active protein kinase, promotes liver cancer cell proliferation up-regulating HIF-1alpha Bcl-xL expression.
