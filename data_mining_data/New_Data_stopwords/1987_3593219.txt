 Phenylephrine, vasopressin glucagon increased amount active (dephospho) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) isolated rat hepatocytes. Treatment 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) opposed increase PDHa caused phenylephrine glucagon, effect response vasopressin: PMA alone effect PDHa. PMA known prevent phenylephrine-induced increase cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) diminish increase [Ca2+]c caused glucagon, effect ability vasopressin increase [Ca2+]c, data consistent notion intact cells increase [Ca2+]c results increase mitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration, turn leads activation PDH. presence 2.5 mM-Ca2+, glucagon caused increase NAD(P)H fluorescence hepatocytes. increase taken reflect enhanced activity mitochondrial dehydrogenases. PMA alone effect NAD(P)H fluorescence; did, however, compromise increase produced glucagon. extracellular free [Ca2+] decreased 0.2 microM, glucagon could still increase NAD(P)H fluorescence. Vasopressin also increased fluorescence conditions; however, vasopressin added glucagon, increase fluorescence observed. Treatment cells PMA resulted smaller increase NAD(P)H fluorescence addition glucagon: subsequent addition vasopressin caused increase fluorescence. Changes [Ca2+]c corresponding changes NAD(P)H fluorescence observed, supporting idea [Ca2+]c indirectly regulates intramitochondrial dehydrogenase activity intact cells. PMA alone effect pyruvate kinase activity, phorbol ester prevent inactivation caused glucagon. latter emphasizes different mechanisms hormone influences mitochondrial cytoplasmic metabolism.
