 BACKGROUND: expression PDK4 elevated diabetes, fasting conditions associated switch utilization glucose fatty acids energy source. previously shown peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), master regulator energy metabolism, coactivates cell lines pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) gene expression via estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha). investigated effects long-term high-fat diet physical activity expression PDK4, PGC-1alpha ERRalpha amount function mitochondria skeletal muscle. METHODS: Insulin resistance induced high-fat (HF) diet 19 weeks C57BL/6 J mice, either sedentary access running wheels. skeletal muscle expression levels PDK4, PGC-1alpha ERRalpha measured quality quantity mitochondrial function assessed. RESULTS: HF mice insulin-resistant low-fat (LF) -fed mice. Upregulation PDK4 ERRalpha mRNA protein levels seen HF diet, combined running even profound effects mRNA expression levels observed. Chronic HF feeding voluntary running significant effects PGC-1alpha mRNA protein levels. remarkable difference found amount function mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: results support view insulin resistance mediated decreased qualitative quantitative properties mitochondria. Instead, role PDK4 contemplated possible contributor high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance.
