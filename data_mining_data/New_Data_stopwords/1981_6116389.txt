 mechanism actions glucagon, alpha- beta-adrenergic agonists, vasopressin angiotensin II liver proposed article summarized Fig. 8. actions glucagon beta-adrenergic agonists liver entirely ascribed interaction specific plasma membrane receptors activate adenylate cyclase leading intracellular accumulation cAMP activation cAMP-dependent protein kinase. enzyme phosphorylates phosphorylase b kinase, glycogen synthase, L-type pyruvate kinase, liver proteins resulting alterations activities account several known hepatic responses glucagon. clear evidence Ca2+ ions involved hepatic actions hormone. Glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, required normal responsiveness liver glucagon. steroids modify cAMP accumulation cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, may act modulating action kinase substrates. Glucocorticoids thyroid hormones decrease beta-adrenergic responses liver apparently decreasing number beta-receptors. Insulin inhibits actions physiological concentrations glucagon decreasing cAMP accumulation: mechanism action unknown. actions alpha-adrenergic agonists, vasopressin angiotensin II liver resemble glucagon, involve accumulation cAMP activation cAMP-dependent protein kinase. agents appear act increasing cytosolic Ca2+ thus altering activities Ca2+-sensitive enzymes phosphorylase b kinase calmodulin-dependent glycogen synthase kinase. receptors appear located exclusively plasma membrane major mechanism raise cytosolic Ca2+ inducing release cation mitochondria. considerations imply existence intracellular messenger(s) agents generated plasma membrane response receptor activation exerts effects mitochondria perhaps intracellular structures. Glucocorticoids thyroid hormones increase alpha-adrenergic responses liver apparently increasing number alpha-receptors. Insulin inhibits responses liver alpha-agonists, vasopressin angiotensin II.
