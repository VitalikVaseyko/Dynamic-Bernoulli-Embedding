 BACKGROUND: Unlike glycolytic enzymes directly catabolize glucose pyruvate, family 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFBs) control conversion fructose-6-phosphate fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, key regulator glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). One family member, PFKFB3, shown highly expressed activated human cancer cells, derivatives PFKFB3 inhibitor, 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO), currently developed clinical trials. However, effectiveness drugs 3PO target energetic pathways limited survival pathways activated reduced ATP nutrient uptake. One pathway process cellular self-catabolism termed autophagy. hypothesized functional glucose starvation induced inhibition PFKFB3 tumor cells would induce autophagy pro-survival mechanism inhibitors autophagy could increase anti-tumor effects PFKFB3 inhibitors. RESULTS: found selective inhibition PFKFB3 either siRNA transfection 3PO HCT-116 colon adenocarcinoma cells caused marked decrease glucose uptake simultaneously increase autophagy based LC3-II p62 protein expression, acridine orange fluorescence acidic vacuoles electron microscopic detection autophagosomes. induction autophagy caused PFKFB3 inhibition required increase reactive oxygen species since N-acetyl-cysteine blocked conversion LC3-I LC3-II increase acridine orange fluorescence acidic vesicles exposure HCT-116 cells 3PO. speculated induction autophagy might protect cells pro-apoptotic effects 3PO found agents disrupt autophagy, including chloroquine, increased 3PO-induced apoptosis measured double staining Annexin V propidium iodide HCT-116 cells Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. Chloroquine also increased anti-growth effect 3PO LLCs vivo resulted increase apoptotic cells within tumors. CONCLUSIONS: conclude PFKFB3 inhibitors suppress glucose uptake, turn causes increase autophagy. addition selective inhibitors autophagy 3PO potent derivatives may prove useful rational combinations treatment cancer.
