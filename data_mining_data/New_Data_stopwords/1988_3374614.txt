 Enolase 2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolase catalyses dehydration 2-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate, turn converted pyruvate kinase pyruvate. describe crystallographic determination structure yeast enolase high resolution (2.25 A) analysis structural homology enolase, pyruvate kinase triose phosphate isomerase. two subunits enolase forms two distinctive domains. larger domain (residues 143-420) regular 8-fold beta/alpha-barrel, first found triose phosphate isomerase, later pyruvate kinase 11 functionally different enzymes. analysis molecular geometries enolase pyruvate kinase based roughly 8-fold symmetry barrel showed structural homology better expected proteins related convergent evolution. argue enolase pyruvate kinase evolved common ancestral multifunctional enzyme could process phosphoenolpyruvate directions along glycolytic pathway. structural sequence evidence muconate lactonizing enzyme later evolved enolase.
