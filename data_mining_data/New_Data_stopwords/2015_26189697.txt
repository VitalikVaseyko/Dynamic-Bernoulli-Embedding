 BACKGROUND: insulin signaling pathway functions major regulator many metabolic cellular functions, shown reversibly suppressed many species hibernation. study characterized regulation PTEN phosphatase, negative regulator insulin receptor network, torpor-arousal cycle hibernation skeletal muscle Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. METHODS: Western blotting RT-PCR used analyze post-translational transcriptional regulations PTEN respectively. Enzymatic activities determined malachite green assay, protein stability assessed using pulse-proteolysis method. RESULTS: torpor, ratio non-phosphorylated PTEN (S380/T382/T383) significantly elevated 1.4-fold late torpor compared euthermic controls; coupled increase substrate affinity PIP3 (by 56%) late torpor. Two proteolytic cleavage PEST motifs identified C-terminus overlapped phosphorylation sites PTEN; pulse-proteolysis analysis PTEN protein showed decrease protein stability late torpor (Cm urea decreased 21%). Furthermore, increase PTEN activity observed correlated decrease PDK-1 phosphorylation 32%, suggesting downstream effect PTEN activation torpor. Transcriptional analysis showed mRNA expression pten pdk-1 remain unchanged hibernation, suggesting post-translation modification primary regulatory mechanism PTEN function. CONCLUSION: Phosphorylation plays important role regulation PTEN enzymatic activity protein stability. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Activation PTEN torpor regulate insulin signaling periods low energy state.
