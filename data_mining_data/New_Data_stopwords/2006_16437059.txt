 Tubulointerstitial nephritis cardinal renal manifestation leptospirosis LipL32, major lipoprotein component leptospiral outer membrane proteins (OMPs), induces robust inflammatory response cultured renal proximal tubule cells nuclear factor-kappaB-related pathway. Here, investigated whether Toll-like receptor (TLR), known play pivotal role innate immunity, could mediate inflammatory response induced leptospiral OMPs renal proximal tubule cells. TLR expression analyzed flow cytometry indirect immunofluorescence cultured mouse proximal tubule (pyruvate kinase simian virus 40-proximal straight (PKSV-PR)) cells. Reverse transcription-competitive polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay undertaken analyze inducible effects inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 also termed CCL2) pathogenic non-pathogenic leptospiral OMPs recombinant lipoproteins either PKSV-PR cells TLR-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Anti-TLR antibodies used blocking experiments. Leptospira santarosai serovar Shermani OMPs LipL32 induced significant increase TLR2 TLR4 expression PKSV-PR cells. increase iNOS CCL2/MCP-1 mRNA expressions could prevented anti-TLR2 antibody, anti-TLR4 antibody. Furthermore, leptospiral OMPs stimulated CCL2/MCP-1 mRNA secreted protein transfected HEK 293 cells TLR2-expressing plasmid, effect cells TLR4-expressing plasmid. conclusion, findings indicate stimulation iNOS CCL2/MCP-1 caused pathogenic leptospiral OMPs, particular LipL32, proximal tubule cells requires TLR2 early inflammatory response.
