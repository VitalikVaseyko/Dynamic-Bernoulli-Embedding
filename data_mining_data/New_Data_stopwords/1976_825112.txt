 1. interconversion pyruvate dehydrogenase inactive phosphorylated active dephosphorylated forms studied skeletal muscle. 2. Exercise, induced electrical stimulation sciatic nerve (5/s), increased measured activity (active) pyruvate dehydrogenase threefold intact anaesthetized rated within 2 min. increase seen 15 min stimulation. 3. perfused rat hindquarter, (active) pyruvate dehydrogenase activity decreased 50% muscle starved diabetic rats. Exercise produced twofold increase activity groups; however, relative differences fed, starved diabetic groups persisted. 4. Perfusion muslce acetoacetate (2 mM) decreased (active) pyruvate dehydrogenase activity 50% rest exercise. 5. Whole-tissue concentrations pyruvate citrate, inhibitors (active) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (inactive) pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase respectively, altered excerise. decrease ATP/ADP ratio observed, appear sufficient account increase (active) pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. 6. results suggest interconversion phosphorylated dephosphorylated forms pyruvate dehydrogenase plays major role regulation pyruvate oxidation eomparison enzyme activity measurements lactate oxidation perfused hindquarter [see preceding paper, Berger et al. (1976)] suggest pyruvate oxidation also modulated concentrations substrates, cofactors inhibitors (active) pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.
