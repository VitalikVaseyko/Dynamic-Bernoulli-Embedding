 stereochemistry proton transfer reaction phosphoenolbutyrate enzyme established. reaction pure Z isomer analogue phosphoenolpyruvate enzyme I, yield phosphoenzyme 2-oxobutyrate, substrate protonated C-3 2re,3si face. stereospecificity established transfer proton (Z)-phospho[3-D]enolbutyrate transfer deuteron (Z)-phospho[3-H]enolbutyrate. E isomer phosphoenolbutyrate substrate enzyme I. Accordingly, reaction phosphoenzyme 2-oxobutyrate yields exclusively Z isomer phosphoenolbutyrate, pro-S proton C-3 2-oxobutyrate abstracted. kinetic H/D isotope effect 6.8 reaction demonstrates rate-limiting nature proton-transfer step. stereochemical analysis 2-oxo[3(R)-H,D]butyrate 2-oxo-[3(S)-H,D]butyrate carried using pyruvate kinase catalyzed enolization compound. enzymatic enolization, phosphate cofactor, rapid neutral pH highly stereospecific reaction: pro-R proton C-3 2-oxobutyrate exchanged solvent. reaction also used generate pure 3R 3S enantiomers 2-oxo[3-H,D]butyrate. degree protonation/deuteration C-3 2-oxobutyrate detected fine structure methyl proton nuclear magnetic resonance signal.
