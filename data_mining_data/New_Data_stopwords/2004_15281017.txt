 previously reported infection Plasmodium yoelii, Plasmodium chabaudi, injection extracts malaria-parasitized red blood cells induces hypoglycemia normal mice normalizes hyperglycemia streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice. P yoelii glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) extracted chloroform:methanol:water (CMW) (10:10:3), purified high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) tested insulin-mimetic activities. effects P yoelii GPIs blood glucose investigated insulin-resistant C57BL/ks-db/db diabetic mice. single intravenous injection GPIs (9 30 nmol/mouse) induced significant dose-related decrease blood glucose (P < .001), insignificantly increased plasma insulin concentrations. single oral dose 2.7 micromol GPIs per db/db mouse significantly lowered blood glucose (P < .01). P yoelii GPIs vitro (0.062 1 micromol/L) significantly stimulated lipogenesis rat adipocytes dose-dependent manner presence absence 10(-8) mol/L insulin (P < .01). P yoelii GPIs stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDH-Pase) inhibited cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). P yoelii GPIs effect activity gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). first report hypoglycemic effect P yoelii GPIs murine models type 2 diabetes. conclusion, P yoelii GPIs demonstrated acute antidiabetic effects db/db mice vitro. suggest P yoelii GPIs, fully characterized, may provide structural information synthesis new drugs management diabetes.
