 heat-activated F1-ATPase chloroplasts repeatedly exposed Mg2+ 2-azido-ATP, followed separation medium nucleotides photolysis, total two sites per enzyme, catalytic noncatalytic, labeled. coupled assay pyruvate kinase half activity lost one site per enzyme modified. However, increased modification resulted loss activity. contrast, methanol-sulfite activation enzyme showed loss catalytic capacity one site per enzyme modified. Predominant labeling either one catalytic one noncatalytic site caused loss activity either assay. indication enzyme modified one site retained catalytic activity verified measurement [18O]Pi species formed [gamma-18O]ATP hydrolyzed partially derivatized enzyme. either catalytic noncatalytic site modification, distributions [18O]Pi species formed showed modified enzyme different catalytic characteristics. interpretation modification azido nucleotides either catalytic noncatalytic sites, capacity rapid catalysis largely lost remaining sites retain weak modified catalytic properties.
