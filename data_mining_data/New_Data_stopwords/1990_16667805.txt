 onset anaerobiosis darkened, N-limited cells green alga Selenastrum minutum (Naeg.) Collins elicited following metabolic responses. rapid decrease energy charge 0.85 stable lower value 0.6 accompanied rapid increases pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate/fructose-6-phosphate ratios indicating activation pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructokinase, respectively. also large increase fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which, since alga lacks pyrophosphate dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, inferred inhibit gluconeogenic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity. changes resulted approximately twofold increase rate starch breakdown indicating Pasteur effect. Pasteur effect accompanied accumulation d-lactate, ethanol succinate fermentation end-products, malate. Accumulation succinate facilitated reductive carbon metabolism partial TCA cycle (GC Vanlerberghe, AK Horsey, HG Weger, DH Turpin [1989] Plant Physiol 91: 1551-1557). initial stoichiometric decline aspartate increases succinate alanine suggests aspartate catabolism provides initial source carbon reduction succinate anoxic conditions. observations allow us develop model regulation anaerobic carbon metabolism model short-term long-term strategies succinate accumulation green alga.
