 hexapeptide (Arg)2-Pro-Thr-Pro-Ala (T1) octapeptide (Arg)2-Pro-Thr-Pro-Ala (T5), reproducing phosphorylatable site protein phosphatase inhibitor-1, physiological target cAMP-dependent protein kinase, five related peptides synthesized method solution. phosphorylation rates peptides cAMP-dependent protein kinase kinetic parameters determined compared hexapeptide (Arg)2-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala, reproducing phosphorylatable site rat liver pyruvate kinase. results obtained show presence threonine instead serine adjacent C-terminal proline represent highly unfavourable factors seriously impairing protein kinase reaction increasing Km depressing V. hand N-terminal proline compatible high phosphorylation rates row four rather two consecutive arginines improves phosphorylation efficiency lowering tenfold Km, without affecting V. extension hexapeptide T1 C-terminal side give derivative (Arg)2-Pro-Thr-Pro-Ala-Thr-Val-Ala significant effect kinetic parameters. Moreover relationship phosphorylation efficiency predicted secondary structures around target residue could evidenced. Therefore local structural features phosphorylatable site inhibitor-1 cannot fully account fast phosphorylation regulatory protein. factors must optimize protein kinase reaction.
