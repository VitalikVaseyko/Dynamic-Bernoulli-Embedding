 9 mM glucose, experimental results show mitochondrial phosphate depletion (induced glucose phosphorylation, catalyzed mitochondrial hexokinase) reduces activities respiratory chain, oxidative phosphorylation, glutaminase. Consequently, 14C-lactate oxidation 14CO2 lowered presence glucose. fall ATP level triggers high aerobic glycolysis deinhibiting fructose-6-P kinase. NADH, generated enhanced glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase activity, increases reducing power. Moreover, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) system shifted toward lactate formation, NAD+ regenerated oligomycin-inhibited ATP production replaced iodoacetate-inhibited ATP production. 14CO2 production lactate accumulation calculated 60% 14C-glucose disappears channelled extraglycolytic reactions. contrary, 82% glucose l mM metabolized non-glycolytic reactions. pyruvate kinase-M2 (PK-M2) inhibition limit glycolytic flow 9 mM glucose, may cause sustained gluconeogenesis.
