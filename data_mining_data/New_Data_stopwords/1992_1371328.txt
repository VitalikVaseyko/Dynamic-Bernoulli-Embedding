 studied kinetics allosteric interactions pyruvate kinase Trypanosoma brucei. kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate depended strongly nature bivalent metal ions. Pyruvate kinase activated Mg2+ highest catalytic activity, also highest S0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate, opposite true pyruvate kinase activated Mn2+. reaction rates Mg(2+)-pyruvate kinase Mn(2+)-pyruvate kinase clearly allosteric respect phosphoenolpyruvate, kinetics Co(2+)-pyruvate kinase hyperbolic. However, Co(2+)-pyruvate kinase still sensitive heterotropic activation. Trypanosomal pyruvate kinase unique best activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate also strong heterotropic activators, much effective fructose 1,6-bisphosphate glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. presence heterotropic activators, sigmoidal kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate bivalent metal ions modified concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate bivalent metal ions needed attain maximal activity. Maximal activities significantly changed Mg2+ Mn2+ activating metal ions. Moreover, Co2+ fructose 2,6-bisphosphate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate, maximal activity significantly reduced. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate resembled fructose 2,6-bisphosphate rather fructose 1,6-bisphosphate glucose 1,6-bisphosphate action K0.5 values former 3 compounds increased Mg2+ replaced Co2+, K0.5 fructose 1,6-bisphosphate glucose 1,6-bisphosphate increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
