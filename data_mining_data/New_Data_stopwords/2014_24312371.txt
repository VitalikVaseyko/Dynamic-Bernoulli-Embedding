 Previous studies demonstrated glucose disposal increased Fyn knockout (FynKO) mice due increased insulin sensitivity. FynKO mice also display fasting hypoglycaemia despite decreased insulin levels, suggested hepatic glucose production unable compensate increased basal glucose utilization. present study investigates basis reduction plasma glucose levels reduced ability liver produce glucose response gluconeogenic substrates. FynKO mice 5-fold reduction phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene protein expression marked reduction pyruvate, pyruvate/lactate-stimulated glucose output. Remarkably, de novo glucose production also blunted using gluconeogenic substrates bypass PEPCK step. Impaired conversion glycerol glucose observed glycerol tolerance test determination conversion (13)C-glycerol glucose fasted state. alpha-glycerol phosphate levels reduced glycerol kinase protein expression levels changed. Fructose-driven glucose production also diminished without alteration fructokinase expression levels. normal levels dihydroxyacetone phosphate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate observed FynKO liver extracts suggested normal triose kinase function. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase) mRNA protein levels normal Fyn-deficient livers, however, large reduction liver fructose-6-phosphate (30-fold) fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (7-fold) levels well reduction glucose-6-phosphate (2-fold) levels. data suggest mechanistic defect allosteric regulation aldolase activity.
