 effects mono- divalent ions (Li(+), K(+), Na(+), Cs(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Mn(2+), Zn(2+)) binding phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) studied attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy combination dialysis accessory. experiments assessed structural change protein well binding mode PEP. indicated signal 1638 cm(-1) assigned beta sheet perturbed differently Na(+) compared monovalent ions. Otherwise, obtained similar conformational changes presence different monovalent cations, therefore, seems unlikely ion effects activity due ion effect structure PEP:PK complex. different divalent cations, particularly large conformational change observed Mn(2+) attributed closed conformation complex. absorption bound PEP also detected. antisymmetric stretching vibration carboxylate group bound PEP indicates homogeneous binding mode Mn(2+) compared divalent ions. symmetric stretching vibration depends monovalent divalent ions, indicating dihedral angle O-C(1)-C(2)-O affected ions catalytic site. Little change bond strengths PEP observed, indicating PEP:PK complex adopt reactive conformation.
