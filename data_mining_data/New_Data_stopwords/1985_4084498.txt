 decarboxylation oxalacetate shows equilibrium-ordered kinetics, Mg2+ adding oxalacetate. Ki Mg2+ increases pK 6.9, corresponding ligand metal probably glutamate, decreases pK 9.2, corresponding water coordinated enzyme-bound Mg2+. V V/KOAA decrease pK 9.2, suggesting carbonyl oxygen oxalacetate must replace water inner coordination sphere Mg2+ prior decarboxylation. enzyme-Mg2+-oxalacetate complex must largely outer sphere one, however, since pK 9.2 seen V profile. phosphorylation glycolate N-hydroxycarbamate (the actual substrate results reaction hydroxylamine bicarbonate) occurs pK 9.2, V/K profiles decreasing pH. alkoxides substrates appear active species, replacing water coordination sphere Mg2+ prior phosphorylation MgATP. Glycolate, N-hydroxycarbamate, bind alkoxide, since V profile former decreases pK 8.9, V latter pH independent. Initial velocity patterns phosphorylation fluoride presence bicarbonate show saturation MgATP fluoride. V/K profile fluoride decreases pK 9.0, showing fluoride must replace water coordination sphere Mg2+ prior phosphorylation.
