 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) expected become second leading cause cancer death 2030. Current therapeutic options limited, warranting urgent need explore innovative treatment strategies. Due specific microenvironment constraints including extensive desmoplastic stroma reaction, PDAC faces major metabolic challenges, principally hypoxia nutrient deprivation. connection oncogenic alterations KRAS mutations brought metabolic reprogramming forefront PDAC therapeutic research. Warburg effect, glutamine addiction, autophagy stand important adaptive metabolic mechanisms cancer cells themselves, however metabolic reprogramming also important feature tumor microenvironment, major impact epigenetic reprogramming tumor cell interactions complex stroma. present comprehensive overview main metabolic adaptations contributing PDAC development progression. review current future therapies targeting range metabolic pathways provided.
