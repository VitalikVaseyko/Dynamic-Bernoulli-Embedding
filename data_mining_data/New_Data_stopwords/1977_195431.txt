 method photometric analysis described allows determine enzyme activities substrate concentrations 50 samples simultaneously multicuvette. Test volume range 30-85 micronl, light path 0.5 2.0 mm. testing principle used colorimetric measurements NADH dependent reactions well. procedure particularly suited kinetic determinations. Variation coefficients determinations substrate concentrations enzyme activities range conventional enzymatic tests.
