 developed method rapid quenching samples taken chemostat cultures Escherichia coli gives reproducible reliable measurements extracellular intracellular metabolites (1)H NMR applied study major central metabolites transition anaerobic aerobic growth. Almost metabolites showed gradual change perturbation air, consistent immediate inhibition pyruvate formate-lyase, dilution overflow metabolites induction aerobic enzymes. Surprisingly, although pyruvate showed almost change intracellular concentration, extracellular concentration transiently increased. absence intracellular accumulation pyruvate suggested one glycolytic enzymes might relocate cell membrane. test hypothesis, chromosomal pyruvate kinase (pykF) modified express either PykF-green fluorescent protein PykF-FLAG fusion proteins. Measurements showed PykF-FLAG relocates cell membrane within 5 min aeration slowly returns cytoplasm, suggesting aeration, PykF associates membrane facilitate secretion pyruvate maintain constant intracellular levels.
