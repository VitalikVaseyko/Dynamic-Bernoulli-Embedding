 Drastic metabolic alterations, Warburg effect, found types malignant tumors. Emerging evidence shows cancer cells benefit alterations, little known affect noncancerous stromal cells within tumor microenvironment. show cancer cells better adapted metabolic changes microenvironment, leading emergence spatial structure. clear example tumor spatial structure localization tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), one common stromal cell types found tumors. TAMs enriched well-perfused areas, perivascular cortical regions, known potentiate tumor growth invasion. However, mechanisms TAM localization completely understood. Computational modeling predicts gradients--of nutrients, gases, metabolic by-products lactate--emerge due altered cell metabolism within poorly perfused tumors, creating ischemic regions tumor microenvironment TAMs struggle survive. tested modeling prediction coculture system mimics tumor microenvironment. Using experimental approach, showed combination metabolite gradients differential sensitivity lactic acid sufficient emergence macrophage localization patterns vitro. suggests cancer metabolic changes create microenvironment tumor cells thrive cells. Understanding differences tumor-stroma sensitivity alterations may open therapeutic avenues cancer.
