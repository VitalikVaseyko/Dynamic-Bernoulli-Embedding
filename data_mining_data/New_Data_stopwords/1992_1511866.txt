 Current models based analysis linear metabolic pathways steady-state predict large increases wild type activity one enzyme alter organism's fitness. prediction tested steps highly branched pathway two conditions known alter steady-state: heat shock nitrogen starvation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants overproducing 1 4 enzymes glycolysis (hexokinase B, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase) subjected heat shock exponential stationary phases growth. neither phase enzyme overexpression alter heat shock sensitivity. starved nitrogen acetate medium, transformants overproducing hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase sporulate rate frequency cells harbouring plasmid vector. Current models therefore correctly predict relationship activity components fitness 3 4 enzymes. contrast, cells overexpressing pyruvate kinase sporulate poorly. defect observed among cells transformed plasmid containing Tn5 disrupted copy PYK gene. findings consistent reports implicate PYK locus yeast cell cycle control suggest may challenging model relations fitness activity multifunctional proteins.
