 influence cadmium intoxication carbohydrate metabolism skeletal muscles liver male Wistar rats studied. Cadmium administered cadmium acetate dose 0.3 mg Cd2+/kg body weight three months. time control rats injected 0.9% NaCl. animals decapitated samples skeletal muscles: soleus muscle (composed mainly red slow twitch fibers; ST) gastrocnemius muscle containing two types fibers (white fast twitch fibers FTb red fast twitch fibers, FTa) liver dissected out. samples muscles, liver serum contents glycogen, glucose, pyruvate lactate, well activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase measured. Intoxication rats cadmium three months resulted reduction glycolytic enzymes serum, ST FTa muscle fibers liver change activities glycolytic enzymes FTb muscle fibers. data obtained concentrations glycogen liver skeletal muscles suggest different mechanisms cadmium influence glycogen utilization organs.
