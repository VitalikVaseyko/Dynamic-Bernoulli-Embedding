 addition central role cellular stress signaling, tumor suppressor p53 modulates mitochondrial respiration nuclear transcription factor activity localizes mitochondria, enhances apoptosis suppresses mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutagenesis. demonstrate new conserved role p53 mtDNA copy number maintenance mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. mammals, mtDNA present thousands copies per cell essential normal development cell function. show p53 null mouse p53 knockdown human primary fibroblasts exhibit mtDNA depletion decreased mitochondrial mass normal culture growth conditions. accompanied reduction p53R2 subunit ribonucleotide reductase mRNA protein mitochondrial transcription factor (mtTFA) protein level only. Finally, p53-depleted cells exhibit significant disruption cellular ROS homeostasis, characterized reduced mitochondrial cellular superoxide levels increased cellular hydrogen peroxide. Altogether, results elucidate additional mitochondria-related functions p53 implicate mtDNA depletion ROS alterations potentially relevant cellular transformation, cancer cell phenotypes, Warburg Effect.
