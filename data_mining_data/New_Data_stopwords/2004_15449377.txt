 Antigenic proteins Neospora caninum (N. caninum) bovine immunoglobulins M, E, A, G investigated using immunoproteomics. Proteins N. caninum (KBA-2) tachyzoite lysates separated two-dimensional gel electrophoresis transferred polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, probed different bovine immunoglobulin class classified. Antigenic spots recognized also identified matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis. 132, 84, 4, 40 antigenic protein spots recognized N. caninum immunoblot profiles bovine IgM, IgE, IgA, IgG, respectively. protein spots, antigenic proteins recognized either IgM, IgE, IgG, IgM IgG HSP70, pyruvate kinase, actin, NCDG-1, tubulin alpha-chain, putative ribosomal protein S2. hand, IgM, IgE, IgA reacted NTPase, HSP60, tubulin beta-chain, putative protein disulfide isomerase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, serine-threonine phosphatase, 14-3-3 protein homologue, GRA2 protein. antigenic proteins identified associated process invasion, proliferation, egression apicomplexans. study, HSP70, actin, NTPase, HSP60, pyruvate kinase, enolase, putative ribosomal protein S2, NCDG-1, GRA2 proteins found immunodominant proteins, may contribute development diagnostic markers vaccine.
