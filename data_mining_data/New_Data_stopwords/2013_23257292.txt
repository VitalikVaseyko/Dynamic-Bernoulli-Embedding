 Altered metabolism one hallmarks cancer cells. best-known metabolic abnormality cancer cells Warburg effect, demonstrates increased glycolysis even presence oxygen. However, tumor-related metabolic abnormalities limited altered balance glucose fermentation oxidative phosphorylation. Key tumor genes p53 c-myc found master regulators metabolism. Metabolic enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations expressing level alterations linked tumorigenesis. review, introduce cancer-associated metabolic disorders current understanding molecular tumorigenic mechanisms.
