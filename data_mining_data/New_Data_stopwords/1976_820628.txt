 focusing sucrose, gradient L-type pyruvate kinase human liver could separated 2 major forms (pI 6.28 +/- 0.03 5.85 +/- 0.09) minor acid form (pI = 5). different forms could also detected focusing acrylamide-ampholine slab gel. major forms interconvertible, equilibrium shifted toward acid form fructose 1,6-diphosphate SH reagents, toward alkaline form proteinic factors extracted ammonium sulphate fractionation liver extracts hemolysates. factors seemed responsible stabilization liver crude extract enzyme alkaline conformation. acrylamide slab gel electrofocusing, erythrocyte pyruvate kinase whole hemolysates exhibited complex pattern composed least 3 introconvertible forms. vitro aging red blood cells storage hemolysates resulted progressive disappearance acid forms strengthening alkaline form. Partially purified erythrocyte enzyme focused 2 major bands, interconvertible influence factors described L-type pyruvate kinase. Although closely related, focusing patterns L-type erythrocyte-type never exactly identical. Double immunodiffusion antihuman erythrocyte-and L-type pyruvate kinases. Moreover, antihuman M2-type serum unable neutralize erythrocyte pyruvate kinase well change electrophoretic mobility. Consequently, conclude human erythrocyte- liver L-type pyruvate kinases existed several conformers interconvertible influence ligands proteinic factors; erythrocyte-type enzyme seems include L-type subunit M1- M2-type subunits. erythrocyte- L-type enzymes, however, identical nature differences discussed.
