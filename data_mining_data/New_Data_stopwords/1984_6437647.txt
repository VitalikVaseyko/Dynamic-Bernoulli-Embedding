 Polymerization microtubule protein vitro tested presence Hg2+. Inhibition occurs presence Hg2+ concentrations lower molarity tubulin, even presence 0.5 mM ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid. estimated concentration free Hg2+ conditions less 10(-20) M. extent inhibition approximately stoichiometric molar quantity tubulin fails polymerize comparable slightly greater total Hg2+ present chelate. affinity susceptible site Hg2+ microtubule protein must exceptionally high may protected natural chelating agents cell. Preformed microtubules rapidly depolymerized addition Hg2+ chelate. vitro, inhibition prevented rapidly reversed 2-mercaptoethanol.
