 Mycoplasma bovis important cause bovine respiratory disease worldwide. understand virulence mechanisms, sequenced three attenuated M. bovis strains, P115, P150, P180, passaged vitro 115, 150, 180 times, respectively, exhibited progressively decreasing virulence. Comparative genomics performed among wild-type M. bovis HB0801 (P1) strain P115, P150, P180 strains, one 14.2-kb deleted region covering 14 genes detected passaged strains. Additionally, 46 non-sense single-nucleotide polymorphisms indels detected, confirmed passages result mutations. subsequent collective bioinformatics analysis paralogs, metabolic pathways, protein-protein interactions, secretory proteins, functionally conserved domains, virulence-related factors identified 11 genes likely contributed increased attenuation passaged strains. genes encode ascorbate-specific phosphotransferase system enzyme IIB IIA components, enolase, L-lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glycerol, multiple sugar ATP-binding cassette transporters, ATP binding proteins, NADH dehydrogenase, phosphate acetyltransferase, transketolase, variable surface protein. Fifteen genes shown enriched 15 metabolic pathways, included aforementioned genes encoding pyruvate kinase, transketolase, enolase, L-lactate dehydrogenase. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production M. bovis strains representing seven passages P1 P180 decreased progressively increasing numbers passages increased attenuation. However, eight mutants specific eight individual genes within 14.2-kb deleted region exhibit altered H2O2 production. results enrich M. bovis genomics database, increase understanding mechanisms underlying M. bovis virulence.
