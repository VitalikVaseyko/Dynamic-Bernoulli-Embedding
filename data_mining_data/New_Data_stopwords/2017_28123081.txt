 Transcriptional deregulation changes mitochondrial bioenergetics, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) dysfunction, described Huntington's disease (HD). showed previously histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) trichostatin sodium butyrate (SB) ameliorate mitochondrial function cells expressing mutant huntingtin. work, investigated effect HDACIs regulation PDH activity striatal cells derived HD knock-in mice YAC128 mice. Mutant cells exhibited decreased PDH activity increased PDH E1alpha phosphorylation/inactivation, accompanied enhanced protein levels PDH kinases 1 3 (PDK1 PDK3). Exposure dichloroacetate, inhibitor PDKs, increased mitochondrial respiration decreased production reactive oxygen species mutant cells, emphasizing PDH interesting therapeutic target HD. Treatment SB sodium phenylbutyrate, another HDACI, recovered cell viability overall mitochondrial metabolism mutant cells. Exposure SB also suppressed hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1alpha) stabilization decreased transcription two abundant PDK isoforms, PDK2 PDK3, culminating increased PDH activation mutant cells. Concordantly, PDK3 knockdown improved mitochondrial function, emphasizing role PDK3 inactivation positive effects achieved SB treatment. YAC128 mouse brain presented higher mRNA levels PDK1-3 PDH phosphorylation decreased energy levels significantly ameliorated SB treatment. Furthermore, enhanced motor learning coordination observed SB-treated YAC128 mice. results suggest HDACIs, particularly SB, promote activity PDH HD brain, helping counteract HD-related deficits mitochondrial bioenergetics motor function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT present work provides better understanding mitochondrial dysfunction Huntington's disease (HD) showing pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex promising therapeutic target. particular, histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (SB) may indirectly (through reduced hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha stabilization) decrease expression abundant PDH kinase isoforms (e.g., PDK3), ameliorating PDH activity mitochondrial metabolism affecting motor behavior HD mice, thus constituting promising agent HD neuroprotective treatment.
