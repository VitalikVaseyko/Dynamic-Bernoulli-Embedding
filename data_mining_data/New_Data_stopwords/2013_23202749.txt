 Clostridium thermocellum, thermophilic anaerobic bacterium able rapidly ferment cellulose ethanol, pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) absent based genome sequence enzymatic assays. Instead, new pathway converting phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate via three-step pathway involving phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, NADH-linked malate dehydrogenase, NADP-dependent malic enzyme found. examined impact targeted modification enzymes associated pathway, termed "malate shunt", including expression pyruvate kinase gene Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum, mutation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deletion malic enzyme gene. Strain YD01 exogenous pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression diminished modifying start codon ATG GTG, exhibited 3.25-fold higher ethanol yield wild-type strain. second strain, YD02 exogenous pyruvate kinase, gene malic enzyme part malate dehydrogenase deleted, 3-fold higher ethanol yield wild-type strain.
