 Tumour proliferation promoted intratumoral metabolic symbiosis lactate stromal cells fuels energy generation oxygenated domain tumour. Furthermore, empirical data show tumour cells adopt intermediate metabolic state lactate respiration glycolysis. study models metabolic symbiosis tumour formalism evolutionary game theory. game model metabolic symbiosis cancer considers two types tumour cells, hypoxic oxygenated, glucose lactate considered two main sources energy within tumour. model confirms presence multiple intermediate stable states hybrid energy strategies tumour. predicts nonlinear interaction two subpopulations leads tumour metabolic critical transitions tumours obtain different intermediate states glycolysis respiration regulated genomic mutation rate. model apply epithelial-stromal metabolic decoupling therapy.
