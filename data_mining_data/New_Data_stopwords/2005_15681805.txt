 Serine racemase (SRace) enzyme catalyzes conversion L-serine pyruvate D-serine, endogenous agonist NMDA receptors. previous studies showed inflammatory stimuli Abeta could elevate steady-state mRNA levels SRace, perhaps leading inappropriate glutamatergic stimulation conditions inflammation. report proinflammatory stimulus (lipopolysaccharide) elevated activity human SRace promoter, indicated expression luciferase reporter system transfected microglial cell line. effect corresponded elevation SRace protein levels microglia, well. contrast, dexamethasone inhibited SRace promoter activity led apparent suppression SRace steady-state mRNA levels. potential binding site NFkappaB explored, sequence played significant role SRace promoter activation. Instead, large deletions site-directed mutagenesis indicated DNA element -1382 -1373 (relative start translation) responsible activation promoter lipopolysaccharide. region fits consensus activator protein-1 binding site. Lipopolysaccharide induced activity capable binding DNA element electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Supershifts antibodies c-Fos JunB identified responsible proteins. inhibitor Jun N-terminal kinase blocked SRace promoter activation, implicating activator protein-1. data indicate proinflammatory stimuli utilize signal transduction pathway culminating activator protein-1 activation induce expression serine racemase.
