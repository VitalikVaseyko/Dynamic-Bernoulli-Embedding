 New Zealand obese mouse, model NIDDM, characterized hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic peripheral insulin resistance. aim study investigate biochemical basis hepatic insulin resistance NZO mice. Glycolytic gluconeogenic enzyme activities measured fed overnight fasted 19- 20-wk-old NZO control New Zealand chocolate mice. NZO mice twice heavy NZC mice. activity glycolytic enzymes glucokinase pyruvate kinase higher, whereas gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK glucose-6-phosphatase lower fed fasted NZO mice. enzyme changes consistent normal response hyperinsulinemia NZO mice. contrast, activity third regulated gluconeogenic enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, similar fed fasted NZO NZC mice despite higher insulin glucose levels NZO mouse. enzyme primarily regulated powerful inhibitor fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. levels metabolite measured found increased fed fasted states NZO mouse, suggesting activity bifunctional enzyme regulates level inhibitor (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6- bisphosphatase) normally regulated NZO mouse. conclude insulin-responsive gluconeogenic glycolytic enzymes normally regulated NZO mouse, abnormality regulation fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase may contribute increase hepatic glucose production mice.
