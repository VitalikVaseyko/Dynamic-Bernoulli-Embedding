 suggested intron/exon structure gene corresponds evolutionary history. Accordingly, early evolution DNA segments encoding short functional polypeptides may rearranged (exon-shuffling) create full-length genes RNA splicing may developed remove intervening sequences (introns) order preserve translational reading frames. conflicting viewpoint would introns randomly inserted previously uninterrupted genes initial evolutionary development. so, sites introns would unlikely consistently reflect domain structure protein. address question, intron/exon structure gene encoding human alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) determined compared gene structures ADHs related proteins, possess nucleotide-binding domains. results indicate introns nucleotide-binding domains genes examined indeed fall positions separate short functional polypeptides (i.e. beta strands) believed comprise domain. argue data easily explained hypothesis introns present ancestral nucleotide-binding domain later rearranged exon-shuffling form various dehydrogenases kinases utilize domain.
