 Lactate dehydrogenase-A(LDH-A) important rate-limiting enzyme Warburg effect. Survival analysis indicated poor clinical outcomes MIBC high LDH-A expression. results vitro experiment indicated LDH-A promotes MIBC cells proliferation, invasion migration. positive relationship LDH-A expression CSC/EMT markers confirmed invasive bladder cell line 136 MIBC specimens. Thus, conclude LDH-A may promising target MIBC.
