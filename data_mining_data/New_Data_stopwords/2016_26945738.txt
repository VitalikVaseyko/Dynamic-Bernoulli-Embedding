 UNLABELLED: Adaptation hypoxia complex process involving up- down-regulation numerous different proteins. order understand molecular responses hypoxia crustacean muscle tissue, flow cytometry oxidative stress analysis used explore (hypoxia) physiological response Macrobrachium nipponense. 2D-gel-based proteomic approach performed compare muscle proteome hypoxic normoxic M. nipponense. MALDI-TOF/TOF identified 15 five proteins significantly up- down-regulated, respectively, M. nipponense muscle hypoxic conditions 24h. Five spots confirmed hemocyanin, indicating important role environmental regulation. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed hemocyanin, heat shock protein 70, glutathione S-transferases, metallothionein, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase 2 up-regulated hypoxia stress. results suggest cellular response hypoxia involves regulating proteins function maintaining antioxidative capacity, energy levels muscle structure. Western blotting confirmed well-known hypoxic stress markers hemocyanin heat shock protein 70 up-regulated. results increase understanding hypoxia-induced proteomic transcriptional changes M. nipponense muscle tissue. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 2-DE proteomic study investigated differentially expressed proteins muscle prawns following hypoxia. Identified proteins may roles response hypoxia. results improve understanding hypoxic stress crustaceans aquatic ecosystems.
