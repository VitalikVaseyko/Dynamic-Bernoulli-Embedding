 studied effects diuretics mersalyl, furosemide ethacrynic acid renal gluconeogenesis isolated rat-kidney tubules activities important gluconeogenic glycolytic enzymes fed fasted rats. Mersalyl (15 mg.kg-1 animal weight) significantly decreased rate gluconeogenesis well-fed rats (68%) well 24 48-h fasted ones (33 37% respectively). inhibition occurred lactate, pyruvate, glycerol fructose used substrates. Ethacrynic acid dose 50 mg.kg-1 animal weight provoked transient inhibition renal glucose production almost 20% fed rats lactate substrate, whereas dose furosemide affect metabolic pathway. Parallel changes, mersalyl caused significant inhibition maximum activity important gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase glucose 6-phosphatase, fed fasted rats. Neither ethacrynic acid furosemide produced variations activities enzymes. activity glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase modified diuretics. Nevertheless, activity thiol-enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase severely inhibited mersalyl lesser extent diuretics. inhibition higher fasted fed rats. Hence, conclude inhibitory effect mersalyl renal gluconeogenesis due, least partly, decrease flux gluconeogenic enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
