 Warburg effect predominant metabolic pathway cancer cells characterized enhanced glucose uptake conversion l-lactate associated upregulated expression HIF-1alpha activation EGFR-MEK-ERK, Wnt-beta-catenin, PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. (R,R')-4'-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol ((R,R')-MNF) significantly reduces proliferation, survival, motility PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells inhibition GPR55 receptor. examined (R,R')-MNF's effect glycolysis PANC-1 cells tumors. Global NMR metabolomics used elucidate differences metabolome untreated (R,R')-MNF-treated cells. LC/MS analysis used quantify intracellular concentrations beta-hydroxybutyrate, carnitine, l-lactate. Changes target protein expression determined Western blot analysis. Data also obtained mouse PANC-1 tumor xenografts administration (R,R')-MNF. Metabolomics data indicate (R,R')-MNF altered fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism increased intracellular concentrations beta-hydroxybutyrate carnitine reducing l-lactate content. cellular content phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 hexokinase 2 reduced consistent diminished PI3K-AKT signaling glucose metabolism. presence GLUT8 transporter established found attenuated (R,R')-MNF. Mice treated (R,R')-MNF significant accumulation l-lactate tumor tissue relative vehicle-treated mice, together reduced levels selective l-lactate transporter MCT4. Lower intratumoral levels EGFR, pyruvate kinase M2, beta-catenin, hexokinase 2, p-glycoprotein also observed. data suggest (R,R')-MNF reduces glycolysis PANC-1 cells tumors reduced expression function multiple controlling sites glycolytic pathway.
