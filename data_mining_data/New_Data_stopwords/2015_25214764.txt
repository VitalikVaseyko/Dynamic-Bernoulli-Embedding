 Compared normal differentiated cells, cancer cells upregulate expression pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) support glycolytic intermediates anabolic processes, including synthesis nucleic acids, amino acids, lipids. study, combination structure-based pharmacophore modeling hybrid protocol virtual screening methods comprised pharmacophore model-based virtual screening, docking-based virtual screening, silico ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion toxicity) analysis used retrieve novel PKM2 activators commercially available chemical databases. Tetrahydroquinoline derivatives identified potential scaffolds PKM2 activators. Thus, hybrid virtual screening approach applied screen focused tetrahydroquinoline derivatives embedded ZINC database. Six hit compounds selected final hits experimental studies performed. Compound 8 displayed potent inhibitory effect human lung cancer cells. Following treatment Compound 8, cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production examined A549 cells. Finally, evaluated effects Compound 8 mice xenograft tumor models vivo. results may provide important information research novel PKM2 activators antitumor agents.
