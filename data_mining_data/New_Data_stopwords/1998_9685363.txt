 USF1 USF2 ubiquitous transcription factors basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family. form homo- heterodimers recognize CACGTG motif termed E box. liver, USF binding activity mainly accounted USF1/USF2 heterodimer, binds vitro glucose/carbohydrate response elements (GlRE/ChoRE) glucose-responsive genes. assign physiological role USFs vivo, undertaken disruption USF1 USF2 genes mice. present generation USF1-deficient mice. liver mice, demonstrate USF2 remaining dimers compensate glucose responsiveness, even though level total USF binding activity reduced half compared wild type mice. residual USF1 binding activity similarly reduced previously reported USF2 -/- mice impaired glucose responsiveness observed (Vallet, V. S., Henrion, A. A., Bucchini, D., Casado, M. , Raymondjean, M., Kahn, A., Vaulont, S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 21944-21949). Taken together, results clearly suggest differential transactivating efficiencies USF1 USF2 promoting glucose response. Furthermore, support view USF2 functional transactivator glucose-responsive complex.
