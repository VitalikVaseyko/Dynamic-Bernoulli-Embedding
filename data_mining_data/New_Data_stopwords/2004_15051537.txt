 Polynucleotide phosphorylase prokaryotic enzyme catalyzes phosphorolysis polynucleotides release nucleotide diphosphates. taking advantage property, developed photometric assay inorganic phosphate. presence polyadenylic acid, phosphate converted adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) enzyme. ADP reacts phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase-catalyzed reaction, thus giving rise adenosine 5'-triphosphate pyruvate. Finally, pyruvate oxidizes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) action L-lactate dehydrogenase, concomitant decrease absorbance 340 nm. expected, detection system 1 mol NADH oxidized per mole phosphate. assay showed excellent reproducibility, standard deviations never exceeded 5%. also shown unaffected several compounds regarded major interferents traditional colorimetric assays. Absence interference also demonstrated determining phosphate content different biological samples, human serum perchloric acid extracts Escherichia coli, yeast, bovine liver. E. coli strain overexpressing His-tagged polynucleotide phosphorylase developed laboratories allowed quick straightforward purification enzyme, making assay feasible convenient. Since reagents required inexpensive, assay represents cheaper alternative commercially available phosphate assay kits.
