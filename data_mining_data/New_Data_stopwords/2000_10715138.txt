 crystal structure selenomethionine-substituted malate synthase G, 81 kDa monomeric enzyme Escherichia coli determined MAD phasing, model building, crystallographic refinement resolution 2.0 A. crystallographic R factor 0.177 49 242 reflections observed incident wavelength 1.008 A, model stereochemistry satisfactory. basic fold enzyme beta8/alpha8 (TIM) barrel. barrel centrally located, N-terminal alpha-helical domain flanking one side. inserted beta-sheet domain folds opposite side barrel, alpha-helical C-terminal domain forms plug caps active site. Malate synthase catalyzes condensation glyoxylate acetyl-coenzyme hydrolysis intermediate yield malate coenzyme A, requiring Mg(2+). structure reveals enzyme-substrate complex glyoxylate Mg(2+) coordinates aldehyde carboxylate functions substrate. Two strictly conserved residues, Asp631 Arg338, proposed provide concerted acid-base chemistry generation enol(ate) intermediate acetyl-coenzyme A, main-chain hydrogen bonds bound Mg(2+) polarize glyoxylate preparation nucleophilic attack. catalytic strategy malate synthase appears essentially citrate synthase, electrophile activated nucleophilic attack nearby positive charges hydrogen bonds, concerted acid-base catalysis accomplishes abstraction proton methyl group acetyl-coenzyme A. active site aspartate is, however, common feature two enzymes, active sites enzymes produced quite different protein folds. Interesting similarities overall folds modes substrate recognition discussed comparisons malate synthase pyruvate kinase pyruvate phosphate dikinase.
