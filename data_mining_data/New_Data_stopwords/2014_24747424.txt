 Cancer cells characterized high glycolytic rates support energy regeneration anabolic metabolism, along expression pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2). latter catalyzes last step glycolysis reprograms glycolytic flux feed special metabolic demands proliferating cells. Besides, PKM2 moonlight functions, gene transcription, favoring cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests critical role played low-activity-dimeric PKM2 tumor progression, supported identification mutations result down-regulation activity tumorigenesis nude mouse model. review discusses PKM2 regulation benefits confers cancer cells. Further, conflicting views PKM2's role cancer, therapeutic relevance future directions field also discussed.
