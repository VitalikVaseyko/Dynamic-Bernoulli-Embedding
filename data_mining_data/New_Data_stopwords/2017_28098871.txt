 Prostatic carcinoma aggressive tumor adult men. Warburg effect important characteristic tumor cell metabolism including prostate cancer cells, hexokinase 2 (HK2), major rate-limiting enzyme involved Warburg effect, selectively upregulated. lectin PCL mannose binding lectin induces tumor cell apoptosis autophagy. present study, report PCL could lower glucose consumption lactate production, shift Warburg effect inhibiting expression HK2 PC3 cells suppression HK2 siRNA reversed effect PCL glucose consumption lactate production. expression HK2 closely related epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) downstream signaling pathway activation, therefore, investigated interaction PCL EGFR western blot analysis found PCL could suppress binding epidermal growth factor (EGF) EGFR HK2 expression. Also, explored binding mechanism PCL EGFR molecular docking molecular dynamics simulations found PCL bocked active site EGFR also binding site nature ligand EGF, resulting conformation higher stability EGF complex EGFR. results indicated PCL could competitively bind EGFR binding pocket prevent EGF binding EGFR, blocking autophosphorylation EGFR tyrosine kinase, EGFR activation inhibited. Collectively, studies concluded PCL inhibits tumor cell glycolysis combining EGFR reducing HK2 expression.
