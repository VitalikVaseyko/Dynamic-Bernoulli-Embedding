 omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) class lipids shown beneficial effects chronic degenerative diseases cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory disorders, diabetes, cancer. Among omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) received particular attention antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiangiogenetic, anti-invasion, antimetastatic properties, even though involved molecular mechanisms well understood. Recently, vitro studies showed DHA promotes inhibition glycolytic enzymes Warburg phenotype. example, shown breast cancer cell lines modulation bioenergetic functions due capacity DHA activate AMPK signalling negatively regulate HIF-1alpha functions. Taking account considerations, review focused current knowledge concerning role DHA interfering cancer cell metabolism; could considered mechanism DHA inhibits cancer cell survival progression.
