 Oxygen profoundly affects composition oral biofilms. Recently, showed exposure Streptococcus mutans oxygen strongly inhibits biofilm formation alters cell surface biogenesis. begin dissect underlying mechanisms oxygen affects known virulence traits S. mutans, transcription profiling used show roughly 5% genes organism differentially expressed response aeration. Among profoundly upregulated genes autolysis-related genes encode bacteriocins, ClpB protease chaperone subunit, pyruvate dehydrogenase, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, NADH oxidase enzymes, certain carbohydrate transporters catabolic pathways. Consistent observation ability S. mutans form biofilms severely impaired oxygen exposure, transcription gtfB gene, encodes one primary enzymes involved production water-insoluble, adhesive glucan exopolysaccharides, down-regulated cells growing aerobically. investigation revealed transcription gtfB, gtfC, responsive oxygen aeration causes major changes amount degree cell association Gtf enzymes. Moreover, inactivation VicK sensor kinase affected expression localization GtfB GtfC enzymes. study provides novel insights complex transcriptional posttranscriptional regulatory networks used S. mutans modulate virulence gene expression exopolysaccharide production response changes oxygen availability.
