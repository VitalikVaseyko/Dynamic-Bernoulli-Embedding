 Several genes/QTLs governing resistance/tolerance abiotic biotic stresses reported mapped rice. QTL submergence tolerance found co-located major QTL broad-spectrum bacterial leaf blight (bs-blb) resistance long arm chromosome 5 indica cultivars FR13A IET8585. Using Nipponbare (japonica) 93-11 (indica) genome sequences, identified, silico, candidate genes chromosomal region [Kottapalli et al. (2006)]. Transcriptional profiling FR13A IET8585 using rice 22K oligo array validated findings. Based silico analysis arraying observed cultivars respond stresses common signaling system involving protein kinases, adenosine mono phosphate kinase, leucine rich repeat, PDZ/DHR/GLGF, response regulator receiver protein. combined approaches suggest transcription factor EREBP long arm chromosome 5 regulates submergence tolerance blb resistance. Pyruvate decarboxylase alcohol dehydrogenase, co-located region, candidate downstream genes submergence tolerance seedling stage, t-snare bs-blb resistance. also detected up-regulation novel defense/stress-related genes including encoding fumaryl aceto acetate (FAA) hydrolase, scramblase, galactose oxidase, response imposed stresses.
