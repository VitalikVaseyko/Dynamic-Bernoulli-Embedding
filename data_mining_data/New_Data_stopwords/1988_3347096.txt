 hematological parameters young (2-month-old) old (2-year-old) mice compared. differences could detected exception increased percentage reticulocytes old animals suggesting anemia senescent mice occur. Red blood cell mean half-life old mice 8 +/- 0.8 days compared 12 +/- 1 days young mice. reduced survival red blood cell due different rate cell phagocytosis reticulohistiocytic system young old animals since erythrocytes young mice mean half-life injected young old animals vice versa. Thus, old mice reduced red cell life-span hematocrit young, suggesting old animals possess chronologically younger population erythrocytes young animals. confirmed measuring specific activities red blood cell age-dependent enzymes (hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase) found higher older animals, separation erythrocytes different density (age) groups Percoll/albumin density gradient centrifugation. However, erythrocytes osmotic fragility, cellular contents adenine pyridine nucleotides, well content 2,3-diphosphoglycerate reduced glutathione, show circulating erythrocytes old animals constitute heterogeneous cell population whose properties cannot explained basis chronologically younger erythrocyte population. Furthermore, evaluation cell components hemopoietic tissues shown increased porportion erythroid precursor cells old animals confirming old mice compensate reduced red cell survival increased erythropoiesis.
