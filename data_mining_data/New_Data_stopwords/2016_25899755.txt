 manipulation cofactor pools ATP NAD(P)H long recognized key targets metabolic engineering microorganisms improve yields productivities biotechnological processes. Several works past shown enforcing ATP futile cycling may enhance synthesis certain products aerobic conditions. However, case studies demonstrating ATP wasting may also beneficial effects anaerobic production processes scarce. Taking lactic acid economically relevant product, demonstrate induction ATP futile cycling Escherichia coli leads increased yields specific production rates anaerobic conditions, even case lactate already produced high yields. Specifically, constructed high lactate producer strain KBM10111 (= MG1655 DeltaadhE::Cam DeltaackA-pta) implemented IPTG-inducible overexpression ppsA encoding PEP synthase which, together pyruvate kinase, gives rise ATP consuming cycle. induction ppsA, KBM10111 exhibits 25% higher specific lactate productivity well 8% higher lactate yield. Furthermore, specific substrate uptake rate increased 14%. However, trade-offs specific volumetric productivities must considered ATP wasting strategies used shift substrate conversion biomass product synthesis discuss potential solutions design optimal processes. summary, enforced ATP futile cycling great potential optimize variety production processes study demonstrates holds true also anaerobic processes.
