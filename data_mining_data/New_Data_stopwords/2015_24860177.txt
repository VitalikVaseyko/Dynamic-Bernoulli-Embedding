 BACKGROUND: metabolic preference malignant glioma glycolysis energy source potential therapeutic target. result cellular heterogeneity tumors, however, relation glycolytic preference, tumor formation, tumor cell clonogenicity remained unknown. address issue, analyzed metabolic profiles isogenic glioma-initiating cells (GICs) mouse model. METHODS: GICs established overexpression H-Ras(V12) Ink4a/Arf-null neural stem cells. Subpopulations cells obtained single-cell cloning, clones differing extracellular acidification potential assessed metabolic characteristics. Tumors formed intracranial implantation clones mice examined pathological features glioma expression glycolytic enzymes. RESULTS: Malignant transformation neural stem cells resulted shift metabolism characterized increase lactic acid production. However, isogenic clonal populations GICs manifested pronounced differences glucose oxygen consumption, lactate production, nucleoside levels. differences paralleled differential expression glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 2 pyruvate kinase M2, differential expression also evident tumors formed clones vivo. CONCLUSIONS: metabolic characteristics glioma cells appear early malignant transformation persist late stages tumor formation. Even isogenic clones may heterogeneous terms metabolic features, however, suggesting detailed understanding metabolic profile glioma imperative effective therapeutic targeting.
