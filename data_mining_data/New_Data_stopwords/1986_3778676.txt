 kinetic properties purified sheep hepatic pyruvate kinase change upon storage. Assayed 0.5 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate 2 mM ADP, saturation fresh enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate hyperbolic, KPEP = 0.1 mM (pH 7.5, 30 degrees C). similar conditions enzyme stored -20 degrees C 1 week yields nonlinear Lineweaver-Burk plot PEP. data may accounted appearance two enzymic forms identical turnover numbers, different KPEP (0.035 +/- 0.005 12.4 +/- 0.6 mM). Storage also increases concentration fructose-1,6-diphosphate required maximal activation nanomolar millimolar levels. Assayed 2 mM ADP 2 mM PEP, apparent KFDP 10 mM. Preincubation stored enzyme PEP presence mercaptoethanol leads significant reversion original kinetic properties. Available data suggest storage-dependent change kinetic behavior rises changes subunit conformation dissociation subunits.
