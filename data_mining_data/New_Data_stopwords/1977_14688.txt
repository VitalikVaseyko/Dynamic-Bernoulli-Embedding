 pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) Streptococcus lactis C10 obligatory requirement monovalent cation divalent cation. NH+4 K+ activated enzyme sigmoidal manner (nH =1.55) similar concentrations, whereas Na+ Li+ could weakly activate enzyme. eight divalent cations studied, three (Co2+, Mg2+ Mn2+) activated enzyme. remaining five divalent cations (Cu2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Ni2+ Ba2+) inhibited Mg2+ activated enzyme varying degrees. (Cu2+ completely inhibited activity 0.1 mM Ba2+, least potent inhibitor, caused 50% inhibition 3.2 mM). presence 1 mM fructose 1,6-diphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) enzyme showed different kinetic response three activating divalent cations. Co2+, Mn2+ Mg2+ Hill interaction coefficients (nH) 1.6, 1.7 2.3 respectively respective divalent cation concentrations required 50% maximum activity 0.9, 0.46 0.9 mM. Mn2+ divalent cation significatn activity absence Fru-1,6-P2. Mn2+ replaced Mg2+, Fru-1,6-P2 activation changed sigmoidal (nH = 2.0) hyperbolic (nH = 1.0) kinetics Fru-1,6-P2 concentration required 50% maximum activity decreased 0.35 0.015 mM. cooperativity phosphoenolpyruvate binding increased (nH 1.2 1.8) value phosphoenolpyruvate concentration giving half maximal velocity decreased (0.18 0.015 mM phosphoenolyruvate) Mg2+ replaced Mn2+ presence 1 mM Fru-1,6-P2. kinetic response ADP altered significantly Mn2+ substituted Mg2+. effects pH binding phosphoenolpyruvate Fru-1,6-P2 different depending whether Mg2+ Mn2+ divalent cation.
