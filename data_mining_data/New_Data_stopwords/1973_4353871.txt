 present study demonstrates importance mitochondrial activities controlling Mucor rouxii morphogenesis. respiratory capacity spores facultatively anaerobic, dimorphic fungus becomes repressed germination growth take place absence oxygen. level activity mitochondrial enzymes cytochrome oxidase malate dehydrogenase lower anaerobic yeastlike cells ungerminated spores aerobic hyphae, reverse true glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase alcohol dehydrogenase. Following exposure air, yeastlike cells convert hyphae lag period corresponding aerobic adaptation. Anaerobic cultures grown presence ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) concentration 10(-4) exhibit hyphal morphology. cells, fully adapted anaerobic fermentation, nevertheless potentially active mitochondria levels respiratory enzymes ungerminated spores. cells able grow immediately aeration, without adaptation lag. Evidence presented indicates morphogenetic effect EDTA result elimination free metals. Additional evidence proving mitochondrial control morphogenesis M. rouxii chloramphenicol (4 mg/ml) induced formation respiratory-deficient, yeastlike cells aerobic cultures.
