 AIM: Intestinal ischemia (Ii) abdominal emergency due blockade superior mesenteric artery resulting 60-100% mortality diagnosed late. Changes several biochemical parameters (-)-lactate, Creatinine kinase isoenzymes lactate dehydrogenase suggested early diagnosis, lack specificity sensitivity. Therefore biochemical parameter greater sensitivity needs identified. METHODS: Wistar male rats randomly assigned two groups; control sham operated (n = 24) ischemic test (n = 24) group. Superior mesenteric arterial occlusion performed ischemic test group 1 h. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) estimated blood portal vein, right ventricle heart, dorsal aorta (DA) inferior vena cava (IVC). Serum glutamic acid pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) also estimated blood portal vein right ventricle heart. RESULTS: significant increase (P<0.001) levels ADH portal blood well heart blood test group (232.72+/-99.45 EU 250.85+/-95.14 EU, respectively) compared control group (46.39+/-21.69 EU 65.38+/-30.55 EU, respectively) observed. Similarly, increased levels ADH observed blood samples withdrawn DA IVC test animals (319.52+/-80.14 EU 363.90+/-120.68 EU, respectively) compared control group (67.68+/-63.22 EU 72.50+/-58.45 EU, respectively). However, test animals significant increase SGPT portal blood (P = 0.054) without much increase heart blood. CONCLUSION: Significant increase levels ADH portal heart blood within 1 h SMA occlusion without increase SGPT heart blood, suggests origin ADH ischemic intestine liver. Similarly, raised ADH levels found DA IVC well. IVC blood represent peripheral blood sample. raised level ADH test animals confirms potential marker early diagnosis Ii.
