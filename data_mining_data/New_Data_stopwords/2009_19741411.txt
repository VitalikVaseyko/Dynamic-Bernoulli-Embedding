 BACKGROUND: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes conversion pyruvate acetyl CoA, effectively controlling entrance glycolysis products aerobic metabolism. hyperlactatemia one hallmarks sepsis, hyphothesized gram-positive negative bacterial toxin treatment interfere mRNA levels regulatory enzymes PDC overall enzyme activity hepatocytes. METHODS: HEP G2 hepatocarcinoma cells incubated 24 hours presence lipopolysaccaride (LPS) lipoteichoic acid. Total RNA isolated message RNA levels pyruvate dehydrogense kinase 4 phosphatase 2 determined RTPCR. Amplified DNA fragments visualized ethidium bromide agarose gels densitometry bands performed. Data normalized housekeeping gene, GAPDH. Enzyme activity determined capturing intact PDC nitrocellulose membranes determining PDC-dependent production NADH. RESULTS: LPS treatment led time dependent increase PDK4 message decreasing PDP2 levels. Enzyme activity, cells, also significantly decreased 24 hours exposure LPS. Cells cultured presence lipoteichoic acid insulin exhibited differing message ratios activity levels evaluated 4 hours, 24 hours shifted mimic observed LPS treated cells. CONCLUSION: data may indicate exposure bacterial cell wall components insulin could create cellular environments result build-up lactate.
