 Gluconeogenic enzymes assayed varying periods exercise recovery determine rapidly changes occur whether persist cessation exercise. Untrained male rats (250 g) ran treadmill 28 m/min killed varying periods exercise recovery. Livers quickly removed analyzed maximal enzyme activities (saturating levels substrate) submaximal activities (low-substrate concentrations). significant enzyme changes exercise increased maximal activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased submaximal activity phosphofructokinase (PFK). Submaximal PFK activity decreased 30 min exercise remained low level exhaustion (172 +/- 16 min). Changes submaximal PFK activity response decreased concentrations fructose-2,6-bisphosphate decreased approximately one-tenth control value 30 min exercise remained low throughout exercise 1 h recovery. PEPCK activity progressively increased exercise highest exhaustion. cAMP level significantly elevated liver rats exercised 30 min continued rise duration. Six hours exercise PEPCK submaximal PFK activities control exercised-rested rats. change PEPCK activity consistent increase rate enzyme synthesis and/or decrease enzyme degradation exercise, whereas lowered activity PFK likely reflects covalent modification 6-phospho-fructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase.
