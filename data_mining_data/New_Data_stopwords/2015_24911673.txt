 purpose present work verify tadalafil affects hepatic glucose output, one primary targets cAMP, isolated perfused rat liver. effects glycogen catabolism oxygen uptake found basal conditions tadalafil concentrations range 0.25 10 muM. However, tadalafil clear time-dependent inhibitory effect cAMP- glucagon-stimulated glucose release. Constant infusion tadalafil range 0.25 10 muM eventually abolished 100% stimulatory action effectors. tadalafil concentrations producing half-maximal rates inhibition cAMP glucagon stimulated glycogenolysis 0.46+/-0.04 1.07+/-0.16 muM, respectively. concentrations close plasma peak concentrations patients ingestion 20 mg tadalafil. drug also diminished activity glycogen phosphorylase increased activities glucose 6-phosphatase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. actions occurred cellular environment. Tadalafil affect binding cAMP protein kinase A. Diminution cAMP-stimulated glucose output opposite expected phosphodiesterase inhibition, common effect attributed tadalafil. Diminution glucose output tadalafil attributed (a) interference glycogen phosphorylase stimulation (b) increased futile cycling glucose 6-phosphate glucose concomitant increased flow hexose units cellular metabolic pathways. effects described present work may prove represent important side effects tadalafil.
