 1. Purification four isozymes pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) L, M1, M2 R much improved give good yields affinity elution chromatography. enzyme eluted phosphocellulose column 0.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate. Types L, M2 R stabilized fructose 1,6-diphosphate throughout purification procedures. 2. isozymes crystallized various conditions: types L R readily crystallized medium low ionic strength, types L, M1, M2 crystallized ammonium sulfate solution different forms presence absence phosphoenolpyruvate. Type M1 also crystallized different forms presence absence fructose 1,6-diphosphate. 3. Amino acid analyses showed compositions types L R, types M1 M2, respectively, similar.
