 Isoproterenol increases phosphorylation LKB, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), enzymes involved regulating fatty acid oxidation. However, inotropic stimulation selectively increases glucose oxidation adult hearts. neonatal heart, fatty acid oxidation becomes major energy source, glucose oxidation remains low. study tested hypothesis increased energy demand imposed isoproterenol originates fatty acid oxidation, secondary increased LKB, AMPK, ACC phosphorylation. Isolated working hearts 7-day-old rabbits perfused Krebs solution (0.4 mM palmitate, 11 mM glucose, 0.5 mM lactate, 100 mU/l insulin) without isoproterenol (300 nM). Isoproterenol increased myocardial O(2) consumption (in J.g dry wt(-1).min(-1); 11.0 +/- 1.4, n = 8 vs. 7.5 +/- 0.8, n = 6, P < 0.05), phosphorylation LKB (in arbitrary density units; 0.87 +/- 0.09, n = 6 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.08, n = 6, P < 0.05), AMPK (0.82 +/- 0.08, n = 6 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.06, n = 6, P < 0.05), ACC-beta (1.47 +/- 0.14, n = 6 vs. 0.97 +/- 0.07, n = 6, P < 0.05), concomitant decrease malonyl-CoA levels (in nmol/g dry wt; 0.9 +/- 0.9, n = 8 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.3, n = 8, P < 0.05) increase palmitate oxidation (in nmol.g dry wt(-1).min(-1); 272 +/- 45, n = 8 vs. 114 +/- 9, n = 6, P < 0.05). Glucose lactate oxidation increased (in nmol.g dry wt(-1).min(-1); 253 +/- 75, n = 8 vs. 63 +/- 15, n = 9, P < 0.05 246 +/- 43, n = 8 vs. 82 +/- 11, n = 6, P < 0.05, respectively), independent alterations pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation, occurred secondary decrease acetyl-CoA content acetyl-CoA-to-free CoA ratio. acetyl-CoA levels decrease response isoproterenol, despite acceleration rates palmitate carbohydrate oxidation, data suggest net rates acetyl-CoA utilization exceed net rates acetyl-CoA generation.
