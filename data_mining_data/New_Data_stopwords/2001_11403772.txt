 Leishmania promastigotes introduced skin blood-sucking phlebotomine sand flies. vertebrate host, promastigotes invade macrophages, transform amastigotes multiply intracellularly. Sand fly saliva shown enhance development cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions inhibiting immune functions host macrophages. study demonstrates sand fly saliva promotes parasite survival proliferation. First, macrophages gravitated towards increasing concentrations sand fly saliva vitro. Secondly, saliva increased percentage macrophages became infected Leishmania promastigotes exacerbated parasite load cells. Thus, natural transmission, saliva probably reduces exposure promastigotes immune system attracting macrophages parasite inoculation site accelerating entry promastigotes macrophages. Saliva may also enhance lesion development shortening generation time dividing intracellular amastigotes.
