 1. Heat production chemical changes measured untreated dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-treated muscles isometric tetani. Levels total creatine (Ct), free creatine, ATP, ADP, AMP, inorganic phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, lactate measured. Changes inosinic acid (IMP) also measured. 2. DNFB effectively inhibited creatine kinase reaction (Lohmann reaction). 3. major finding even effective treatment DNFB observed heat plus work 2 sec 5 sec stimulation significantly greater enthalpy change produced measured chemical changes. confirms unidentified exothermic process occurs muscle contraction; conclusion reached previously studies untreated muscle. 4. unexplained heat plus work unlikely derived glycolytic reactions since anaerobic conditions formation lactate, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate fructose-1,6-diphosphate could detected either untreated DNFB-treated muscles even 34 sec series three 5 sec isometric tetani. 5. first 2 sec stimulation unexplained heat plus work less DNFB-treated muscles untreated muscles. However 2 5 sec stimulation unexplained heat plus work treated untreated muscles.
