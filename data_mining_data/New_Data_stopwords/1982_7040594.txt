 enzyme enhanced luminescence immunoassay developed using determination serum transferrin model. assay compared established radioimmunoassay, details already published (Wood, W. G. et al. (1980) Fresenius Z. Anal. Chem. 301, 120). comparison, luminescence immunoassay introduced routine method determining transferrin levels human serum. enzyme enhanced luminescence immunoassay uses pyruvate kinase labelled transferrin tracer, which, antibody-antigen reaction subsequent bound-free separation, used generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) adenosine diphosphate(ADP) phosphoenol pyruvate. ATP monitored firefly luciferin-luciferase reagent, using luminometer detection system. intra- interassay coefficients variation 10% 13% respectively range 0.6-4.5 g . liter-1. stability lyophilised tracer excess 5 months stored 4 degrees C, sensitivity assay lay 0.1 micrograms per tube, although detection limit type assay system fully explored.
