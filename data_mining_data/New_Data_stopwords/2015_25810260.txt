 Kidney cancer [renal cell carcinoma (RCC)] sixth-most-common cancer United States, incidence increasing. current progression-free survival patients advanced RCC rarely extends beyond 1-2 yr due development therapeutic resistance. previously identified peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) potential therapeutic target disease showed specific PPARalpha antagonist, GW6471, induced apoptosis cell cycle arrest G0/G1 RCC cell lines associated attenuation cell cycle regulatory proteins. extend work show PPARalpha inhibition attenuates components RCC metabolic reprogramming, capitalizing Warburg effect. specific PPARalpha inhibitor GW6471, well siRNA specific PPARalpha, attenuates enhanced fatty acid oxidation oxidative phosphorylation associated glycolysis inhibition, PPARalpha antagonism also blocks enhanced glycolysis observed RCC cells; effect occur normal human kidney epithelial cells. cell type-specific inhibition glycolysis corresponds changes protein levels oncogene c-Myc promising clinical implications. Furthermore, show treatment GW6471 results RCC tumor growth attenuation xenograft mouse model, minimal obvious toxicity, finding associated expected on-target effects c-Myc. studies demonstrate several pivotal cancer-relevant metabolic pathways inhibited PPARalpha antagonism. data support concept targeting PPARalpha, without concurrent inhibition glycolysis, potential novel effective therapeutic approach RCC targets metabolic reprogramming tumor.
