 BACKGROUND/AIMS: contrast streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rodent models diabetes, thorough characterizations intestinal phenotype underlying changes global gene-expression genetic models diabetes, Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. aim present study characterize intestine ZDF rat. METHODS: intestine ZDF rats lean controls examined macroscopically histologically, ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) performed samples jejunal mucosa. RESULTS: observed increased mass length small large intestines ZDF rats. RNAseq showed increased expression Pdk2 Pdk4, involved regulation glucose fatty acid metabolism, increased expression genes involved gluconeogenesis peroxisomal beta-oxidation jejunal mucosa. CONCLUSION: Intestinal enlargement ZDF rats likely driven increased food intake, since (i) also occurs obese normoglycemic Zucker fatty rats, (ii) insulin treatment STZ-induced diabetic rats reduced food intake mass small intestine. Results RNAseq indicate small intestinal epithelial cells ZDF rats developed insulin resistance, support normal physiological effect insulin enterocytes regulation glucose metabolism.
