 enzyme activities metabolic features black melanotic, brown MI melanotic Ab amelanotic melanomas hamster investigated. activities hexokinase phosphofructokinase similar three melanomas, activity NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase higher amelanotic melanoma pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase slightly lower MI tumors. activities citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase higher MI melanotic melanomas Ab amelanotic melanoma. rate labeled CO2 production 6-14C-glucose, 1,5-14C-citric acid U-14C-glutamine 2 times higher melanotic melanomas amelanotic one, significant differences among three melanomas found respect 1-14C-glucose U-14C-glycerol-3-phosphate. production 14CO2 much higher 1-14C-glucose 6-14C-glucose melanomas studied. L-DOPA stimulated production 14CO2 1-14C-glucose much stronger MI melanomas Ab melanoma. none tumors incorporation 6-14C-glucose CO2 affected L-DOPA. postulated oxidation glucose via pentose phosphate cycle involved melanogenesis.
