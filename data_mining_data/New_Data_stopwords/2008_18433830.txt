 Antiviral alpha-P-borano substituted NTPs promising chain terminators targeting HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). Activation antiviral nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) NTPs may carried pyruvate kinase (PK) creatine kinase (CK). Herein, presented effects nucleobase, ribose, alpha-phosphate substitutions substrate specificities CK PK. enzymes showed two binding modes negative cooperativity respect substrate binding. stereospecificity inhibition ADP phosphorylation alpha-P-borano substituted NDP (NDPalphaB) stereoisomers also investigated. Sp-ADPalphaB isomer 70-fold better substrate CK Rp isomer, whereas PK preferred Rp isomer NDPalphaBs. CK, Sp-ADPalphaB isomer competitive inhibitor; PK, Rp-ADPalphaB isomer poor competitive inhibitor Sp-ADPalphaB isomer poor non-competitive inhibitor. Taken together, data suggest that, although Rp-NDPalphaB isomer would minimally phosphorylated CK PK, inhibit either enzyme.
