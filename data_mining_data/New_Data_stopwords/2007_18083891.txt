 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) lethal syndrome characterized vascular obstruction right ventricular failure. Although fundamental cause remains elusive, many predisposing disease-modifying abnormalities occur, including endothelial injury/dysfunction, bone morphogenetic protein receptor-2 gene mutations, decreased expression O(2)-sensitive K(+) channel (Kv1.5), transcription factor activation [hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) nuclear factor-activating cells], de novo expression survivin, increased expression/activity serotonin transporters platelet-derived growth factor receptors. Together, abnormalities create cancerlike, proliferative, apoptosis-resistant phenotype pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). possible unifying mechanism PAH comes studies fawn-hooded rats, manifest spontaneous PAH impaired O(2) sensing. PASMC mitochondria normally produce reactive O(2) species (ROS) proportion P(O2). Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) converts intramitochondrial superoxide diffusible H(2)O(2), serves redox-signaling molecule, regulating pulmonary vascular tone structure effects Kv1.5 transcription factors. O(2) sensing mediated mitochondria-ROS-HIF-1alpha-Kv1.5 pathway. PAH cancer, mitochondrial metabolism redox signaling reversibly disordered, creating pseudohypoxic redox state characterized normoxic decreases ROS, shift oxidative glycolytic metabolism HIF-1alpha activation. Three newly recognized mitochondrial abnormalities disrupt mitochondria-ROS-HIF-1alpha-Kv1.5 pathway: 1) mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activation, 2) SOD2 deficiency, 3) fragmentation and/or hyperpolarization mitochondrial reticulum. pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, dichloroacetate, corrects mitochondrial abnormalities experimental models PAH human cancer, causing regression diseases. Mitochondrial abnormalities disturb ROS-HIF-1alpha-Kv1.5 O(2)-sensing pathway contribute pathogenesis PAH cancer constitute promising therapeutic targets.
