 describe useful metabolic engineering tool, multiple-gene-promoter shuffling (MGPS), optimize expression levels multiple genes. method approaches optimized gene overexpression level fusing promoters various strengths genes interest particular pathway. Selection promoters based expression levels native genes physiological conditions intended application. MGPS implemented yeast xylose fermentation mixture shuffling promoters GND2 HXK2 genes transaldolase (TAL1), transketolase (TKL1), pyruvate kinase (PYK1) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FPL-YSX3. host strain integrated xylose-metabolizing genes, including xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, xylulose kinase. optimal expression levels TAL1, TKL1, PYK1 identified analysis volumetric ethanol production transformed cells. found optimal combination ethanol production GND2-TAL1-HXK2-TKL1-HXK2-PYK1. MGPS method could easily adapted eukaryotic prokaryotic organisms optimize expression genes industrial fermentation.
