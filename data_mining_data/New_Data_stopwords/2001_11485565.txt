 hepatocytes, amount Spot 14 (S14) protein closely related full expression enzymes involved glycolytic lipogenic pathways. present study address role played protein control transcription L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene primary hepatocytes. show human S14, bind L-PK promoter, physically interacts human chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor 1 (COUP-TF1) induces switch factor repressor activator. However, enhancing activity S14 COUP-TF1 depends presence proximal GC-rich box (the L0 element) specifically binds nuclear proteins livers rats fed glucose-rich diet. Moreover, L0 element, strongly binds dephosphorylated specificity protein 1 (Sp1), loses affinity factor phosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Mutations affect binding Sp1 nuclear proteins L0 box also decrease basal transcription impair glucose responsiveness promoter. results therefore shed light mechanism S14 protein, whose concentration rapidly rises glucose intake, contributes full activity L-PK promoter.
