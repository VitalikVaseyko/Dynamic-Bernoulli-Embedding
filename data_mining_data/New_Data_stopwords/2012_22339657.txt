 Cancer cell proliferation progression require sufficient supplies nutrients including carbon sources, nitrogen sources, molecular oxygen. Particularly, carbon sources molecular oxygen critical generation ATP building blocks, maintenance intracellular redox status. However, solid tumors frequently outgrow blood supply, resulting nutrient insufficiency. Accordingly, cancer cell metabolism shows aberrant biochemical features consequences oncogenic signaling adaptation. adaptive metabolism features, including Warburg effect addiction glutamine, may form biochemical basis resistance chemotherapy radiation. better understanding regulatory mechanisms link signaling pathways adaptive metabolic reprogramming may identify novel biomarkers drug development. review, focus regulation carbon source utilization cellular level, emphasizing relevance proliferative biosynthesis cancer cells. summarize essential needs proliferating cells metabolic features glucose, lipids, glutamine, review roles transcription regulators (i.e., HIF-1, c-Myc, p53) two major oncogenic signaling pathways (i.e., PI3K-Akt MAPK) regulating utilization carbon sources. Finally, effects glucose cell proliferation perspective biochemical cellular angles discussed.
