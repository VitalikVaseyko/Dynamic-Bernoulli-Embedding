 mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate acetyl-CoA. PDC activity tightly regulated four members family pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms (PDK1-4), phosphorylate inactivate PDC. Recently, development specific inhibitors PDK4 become especially important focus pharmaceutical management diabetes obesity. study, crystal structures human PDK4 complexed either AMPPNP, ADP inhibitor M77976 determined. ADP-bound PDK4 slightly wider active-site cleft disordered ATP lid compared AMPPNP-bound PDK4, although forms PDK4 assume open conformations wider active-site cleft closed conformation previously reported ADP-bound PDK2 structure. M77976 binds ATP-binding pocket PDK4 causes local conformational changes complete disordering ATP lid. M77976 binding also leads large domain rearrangement expands active-site cleft PDK4 compared ADP- AMPPNP-bound forms. Biochemical analyses revealed M77976 inhibits PDK4 increased potency compared previously characterized PDK inhibitor radicicol. Thus, present structures demonstrate first time flexible dynamic aspects PDK4 open conformation provide basis development novel inhibitors targeting nucleotide-binding pocket PDK4.
