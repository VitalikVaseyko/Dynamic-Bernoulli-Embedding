 effect changing concentrations glycolytic intermediates binding phosphofructokinase, aldolase pyruvate kinase cellular particulate matter investigated. Concentrations glycolytic intermediates altered adding 2 mM iodoacetic acid (IAA) incubation medium containing tissues isolated channelled whelk Busycon canaliculatum. Iodoacetic acid inhibited glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity causing 100-400 fold increase concentration fructose 1,6-bisphosphate well 3-20 fold increases glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate levels depending experimental protocol. Cellular pH values statistically different presence IAA. Measurement enzyme binding particulate matter showed binding phosphofructokinase, aldolase pyruvate kinase unaffected iodoacetic acid experimental condition. results show changes tissue concentrations enzyme substrates products regulate enzyme binding particulate matter cell.
