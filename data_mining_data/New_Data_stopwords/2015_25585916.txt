 Selective targeting cancer cells employing multiple combinations co-drug holds promise new generation therapeutics. Betulinic acid (BA), plant secondary metabolite kills cancer cells Dichloroacetate (DCA) capable reversing Warburg phenotype inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Here, report synthesis, characterization tumoricidal potential co-drug Bet-CA, DCA molecule appended C-3 hydroxyl group BA generate ester derivative increased solubility subsequent cleavage internal esterase(s) release one unit BA DCA. vitro studies revealed pronounced synergistic cytotoxicity Bet-CA broad spectrum cancer cells selectively killed co-cultured human fibroblasts. Bet-CA treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, significantly altered mitochondrial membrane potential gradient (DeltaPsim); followed release cytochrome c (Cyt c) prompted cells undergo mitochondria mediated apoptosis. vivo experimentation expectedly exhibited tumor inhibitory potential Bet-CA clinically achievable doses produce apparent toxicity. Taken together, results suggestively raise important corollary hypothesis stating Bet-CA selectively synergistically combats cancer without producing toxic manifestations emerges prospect new generation therapeutics.
