 Right ventricular failure (RVF) leading cause death pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). patients pulmonary hypertension adaptive remodelers develop RV hypertrophy (RVH) retain RV function; others maladaptive remodelers rapidly develop RVF. cause RVF unclear understudied PAH therapies focus regressing pulmonary vascular disease. Studies animal models human RVH suggest reduced glucose oxidation increased glycolysis adaptive maladaptive RVH. metabolic shift oxidative mitochondrial metabolism less energy efficient glycolytic metabolism may reflect myocardial ischemia. hypothesize maladaptive RVH vicious cycle RV ischemia transcription factor activation causes shift oxidative glycolytic metabolism thereby ultimately promoting RVF. Interrupting cycle, reducing ischemia enhancing glucose oxidation, might therapeutic. Dichloroacetate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, beneficial effects RV function metabolism experimental RVH, notably improving glucose oxidation enhancing RV function. suggests mitochondrial dysfunction RVH may amenable therapy. mini review, describe role impaired mitochondrial metabolism RVH, using rats adaptive (pulmonary artery banding) maladaptive (monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension) RVH models human disease. discuss possible mechanisms, relevant transcriptional factors, potential mitochondrial metabolic therapeutics RVH RVF.
