 Several glycolytic enzymes observed 40-90% activities associated particulate fractions lysed nerve endings. enzymes showing high particulate activity lysed nerve endings hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), glucosephosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.27). exception phosphofructokinase, 80% particle associated activity enzyme solubilized salt treatment indicating association particles ionic. Sub-fractionation lysed nerve endings showed hexokinase fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2) highest specific activity fractions consistent observations indicating hexokinase associated mitochondria. glycolytic zymes high particulate activity, aldolase, glucosephosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, showed enrichment fractions containing synaptosomal membranes, i.e. fractions highest specific activity acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) (Na+ + K+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3).
