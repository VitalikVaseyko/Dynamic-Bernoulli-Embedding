 moderate conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) shown inhibit sperm motility several hours incubation. rapid decrease flagellar beat frequency observed within first hour contact ROS spermatozoa associated rapid loss intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Motility intact spermatozoa ceased ATP concentration reduced 85 +/- 5%. Axonemal damage confirmed ROS-treated spermatozoa could reactivate motility demembranation medium containing magnesium adenosine triphosphate (Mg.ATP). However, conditions allowing rephosphorylation axonemes (addition cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP, protein kinase sperm extracts demembranation medium), motility could reactivate. Three lines evidence suggested ATP depletion induced ROS treatment responsible effects observed spermatozoa. First, rapid decrease intracellular ATP observed ROS treatment closely followed decrease beat frequency, loss intact sperm motility, axonemal damage due insufficient phosphorylation. Second, incubation spermatozoa combination pyruvate-lactate allowed maintenance sperm ATP normal level prevented effects ROS; furthermore, spermatozoa immobilized ROS treatment, supplemented pyruvate-lactate, able reinitiate motility parallel increase ATP level. Third, treatment spermatozoa rotenone, ATP depleting agent, produced effects similar ROS treatment could also reversed addition pyruvate-lactate. data consistent conclusion ROS treatment produced axonemal damage mostly result ATP depletion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
