 BACKGROUND/AIM: vitro cell model long-term estrogen-deprived MCF-7 (LTED) cells utilized analyze re-growth mechanisms breast cancers treated blockers estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) signaling. Bongkrekic acid (BKA) natural toxin isolated coconut tempeh contaminated bacterium Burkholderia cocovenans. MATERIALS METHODS: LTED cells, MCF-7 cells MDA-MB-231 cells employed study. treatment BKA (chemically synthesized; purity: >98%), several biochemical analyses carried out. RESULTS: LTED cells categorized oxidative phenotype. LTED cells treated BKA, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A)/pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) down-regulated, thereby prompting aggressive use glucose via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation induction cell death responses. effects BKA observed breast cancer cells analyzed. CONCLUSION: suggest potential BKA experimental tool analysis cancer biology LTED cells.
