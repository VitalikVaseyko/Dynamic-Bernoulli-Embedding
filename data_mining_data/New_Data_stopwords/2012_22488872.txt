 Huntington's disease (HD) characterized dysfunction mitochondrial energy metabolism, associated functional impairment succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial complex II), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Treatment 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), potent irreversible inhibitor succinate dehydrogenase, replicates pathophysiological features HD. present study, investigated effect (-)schisandrin B [(-)Sch B, potent enantiomer schisandrin B] 3-NP-induced cell injury rat differentiated neuronal PC12 cells. 3-NP caused cell necrosis, assessed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, mitochondrion-dependent cell apoptosis, assessed caspase-3 caspase-9 activation, differentiated PC12 cells. cytotoxicity induced 3-NP associated depletion cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) well activation redox-sensitive c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway inhibition PDH. (-)Sch B pretreatment (5 15 muM) significantly reduced extent necrotic apoptotic cell death 3-NP-challenged cells. cytoprotection afforded (-)Sch B pretreatment associated attenuation 3-NP-induced GSH depletion well JNK activation PDH inhibition. (-)Sch B pretreatment enhanced cellular glutathione redox status ameliorated 3-NP-induced cellular energy crisis, presumably suppressing activated JNK-mediated PDH inhibition, thereby protecting necrotic apoptotic cell death differentiated PC12 cells.
