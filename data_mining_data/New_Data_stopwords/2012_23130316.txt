 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity crucial maintains blood glucose ATP levels, largely depends phosphorylation status pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoenzymes. Although reported PDC phosphorylated inactivated PDK2 PDK4 metabolically active tissues including liver, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney starvation diabetes, precise mechanisms expression PDK2 PDK4 transcriptionally regulated still remains unclear. Insulin represses expression PDK2 PDK4 via phosphorylation FOXO PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Several nuclear hormone receptors activated due fasting increased fat supply, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, glucocorticoid receptors, estrogen-related receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, also participate up-regulation PDK2 PDK4; however, endogenous ligands bind nuclear receptors identified. recently suggested growth hormone, adiponectin, epinephrine, rosiglitazone also control expression PDK4 tissue-specific manners. review, discuss several factors involved expressional regulation PDK2 PDK4, introduce current studies aimed providing better understanding molecular mechanisms underlie development metabolic diseases diabetes.
