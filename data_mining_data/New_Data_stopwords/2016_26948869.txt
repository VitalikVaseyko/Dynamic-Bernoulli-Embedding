 high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein central role immunological antitumour defense. show natural killer cell-derived HMGB1 directly eliminates cancer cells triggering metabolic cell death. HMGB1 allosterically inhibits tetrameric pyruvate kinase isoform M2, thus blocking glucose-driven aerobic respiration. results rapid metabolic shift forcing cells rely solely glycolysis maintenance energy production. Cancer cells acquire resistance HMGB1 increasing glycolysis using dimeric form PKM2, employing glutaminolysis. Consistently, observe increase expression key enzyme glutaminolysis, malic enzyme 1, advanced colon cancer. Moreover, pharmaceutical inhibition glutaminolysis sensitizes tumour cells HMGB1 providing basis therapeutic strategy treating cancer.
