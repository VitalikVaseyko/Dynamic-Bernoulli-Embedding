 main purpose study examine whether streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes (T1D) insulin (INS) treatment affect mitochondrial function, fission/fusion biogenesis, autophagy tau protein phosphorylation cerebral cortex diabetic rats treated INS. significant alterations observed mitochondrial function well pyruvate levels, despite significant increase glucose levels observed INS-treated diabetic rats. significant increase DRP1 protein phosphorylated Ser616 residue observed brain cortex STZ rats. Also increase NRF2 protein levels number copies mtDNA observed STZ diabetic rats, alterations normalized INS. slight decrease LC3-II levels observed INS-treated rats compared STZ diabetic animals. increase tau protein phosphorylation Ser396 residue observed STZ diabetic rats INS treatment partially reversed effect. Accordingly, modest reduction activation GSK3beta significant increase activity phosphatase 2A found INS-treated rats compared STZ diabetic animals. significant alterations observed caspases 9 3 activity synaptophysin PSD95 levels. Altogether results show mitochondrial alterations induced T1D seem involve compensation mechanisms since significant changes mitochondrial function synaptic integrity observed diabetic animals. addition, INS treatment able normalize alterations induced T1D supporting importance INS signaling brain.
