 Chronopotentiometry electrochemical impedance spectroscopy used study transient behavior potentiometric response mechanism polymer membrane-based sensor heparin. Membrane composition 66 wt % poly(vinyl chloride), 33 wt % o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (plasticizer), 0.05 tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (ion exchanger) deposited surface silver glassy carbon (GC) electrode. latter case, membrane contained also 0.1 1,1'-dimethylferrocene/1,1'-dimethylferricenium+ couple ensuring electronic contact membrane GC. sensor dipped aqueous solution 0.1 LiCl, stirred magnetic stirrer (2-18.2 Hz), eventually spiked heparin (0.05-5 U mL-1). Chronopotentiometric measurements carried using either Ag supported membrane thickness>100 microm GC supported membrane defined thickness 2-30 microm, also used impedance measurements. Remarkable features potentiometric response include linear dependence initial slope potential transient heparin concentration aqueous phase square root stirring frequency, absence effect membrane thickness. Impedance measurements (0.1 Hz-10 kHz) made possible identify evaluate geometric capacitance capacitance electric double layer membrane/solution interface, bulk membrane charge-transfer resistances, Warburg impedance chloride transport. Changes membrane bulk charge-transfer resistances Warburg impedance upon spiking aqueous solution heparin found consistent steady-state response approximately -25 mV, indicating bulk chloride concentration membrane decreased half initial value. novel theoretical model transient behavior developed based balance charging faradic currents chloride heparin, accordance ion-exchange mechanism proposed previously. concluded initial slope potential transient linked charging double layer coupled chloride ion transfer across membrane/solution interface diffusion-limited transport heparin solution. potentiometric assay heparin could based measurements initial slope potential transient potential fixed time shortly heparin injection.
