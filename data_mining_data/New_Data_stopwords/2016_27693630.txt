 Cetuximab inhibits HIF-1-regulated glycolysis cancer cells, thereby reversing Warburg effect leading inhibition cancer cell metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activated cetuximab treatment, sustained AMPK activity mechanism contributing cetuximab resistance. Here, investigated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), downstream target AMPK, rewires cancer metabolism response cetuximab treatment. found introduction experimental ACC mutants lacking AMPK phosphorylation sites (ACC1_S79A ACC2_S212A) head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells protected HNSCC cells cetuximab-induced growth inhibition. HNSCC cells acquired cetuximab resistance contained high levels T172-phosphorylated AMPK S79-phosphorylated ACC1 also increased level total ACC. findings corroborated tumor specimens HNSCC patients treated cetuximab. Cetuximab plus TOFA (an allosteric inhibitor ACC) achieved remarkable growth inhibition cetuximab-resistant HNSCC xenografts. data suggest novel paradigm cetuximab-mediated activation AMPK subsequent phosphorylation inhibition ACC followed compensatory increase total ACC, rewires cancer metabolism glycolysis-dependent lipogenesis-dependent.
