 critical role altered cellular metabolism plays promoting maintaining cancer phenotype received considerable attention recent years. many years believed aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg Effect, played important role cancer. However, recent studies highlight requirement mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation biosynthetic pathways cancer. promoted interest mechanisms controlling metabolic pathways. PPARgamma coactivator (PGC)-1 family transcriptional coactivators emerged key regulators several metabolic pathways including oxidative metabolism, energy homeostasis glucose lipid metabolism. PGC-1s implicated number metabolic diseases, recent studies highlight important role cancer. Studies show PGC-1s pro anticancer functions suggests dynamic role PGC-1s cancer. discuss review links PGC-1s cancer, focus well studied family member, PGC-1alpha.
