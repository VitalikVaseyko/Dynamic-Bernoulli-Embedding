 authors looked altered proteins senescent cultured cells adult liver. Four enzymes (phosphoglycerate kinase, M2 type pyruvate kinase, glucose phosphate isomerase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) studied immunological enzymatic titration electrofocusing. addition, heat stability glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) appraised cell crude extracts partially purified preparations. Enzymatic aactivity well immunological reactivity four enzymes studied identical 16 lines phase II 13 lines phase III. Electrofocusing pattern enzymes 'young cells' identical ones 'old cells'. Finally, G6PD old cells seemed unstable G6PD young cells studied crude extracts. differences, however, disappeared G6PD partially purified old young cultured cells. Consequently, evidence altered protein, either missynthesized posttranslationally modified, found senescent cultured cells studied. Moreover, work indicated modification heat stability G6PD old cells due enzyme molecule rather cell medium.
