 rabbit sheep erythrocytes concentrations 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate glucose 1,6-bisphosphate suffer important changes birth, differ species. changes fructose 2,6-bisphosphate glucose 1,6-bisphosphate correlate changes levels enzymatic activities involved synthesis. change 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate levels rabbit sheep erythrocytes could explained changes phosphofructokinase/pyruvate kinase 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthase/2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase activity ratios.
