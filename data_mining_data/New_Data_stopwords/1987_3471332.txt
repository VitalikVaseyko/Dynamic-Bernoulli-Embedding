 Cellular glucose-metabolizing enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) utilized biochemical markers mononuclear cell (MNC) leukemia maintained serial cell transplantation F344 rats. evaluated sensitivity reproducibility tumor markers comparison diagnostic criteria leukemia. Weanling rats injected 2 X 10(7) leukemic spleen MNC sampled 6, 35, 63, 83 days. 6 days, glycolytic enzyme activities spleen decreased believed residual activity injected leukemic MNC. Glycolytic enzyme activities spleen MNC normal 35 days changes blood MNC enzyme activity occurred 6 days 35 days. 63 days, prior clinical evidence leukemia, glucose-metabolizing enzymes spleen MNC changed, decreases AChE blood spleen MNC progressively decreased 83 days, depressed body weight, splenomegaly, elevated WBC, depressed RBC, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated serum enzyme levels. Separation leukemic MNC blood spleen enhances sensitivity cellular enzyme responses provides reproducible model study biochemical markers correlated severity leukemia.
