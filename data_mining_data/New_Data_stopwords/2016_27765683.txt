 Chemical carcinogenesis, albeit complex, often relies modulation transcription activation repression key transcription factors. analyzing extensive networks may hinder biological interpretation, one may focus dynamic network motifs, among persistent feed-forward loops (FFLs) known chronically influence transcriptional programming. Here, investigate relevance FFL-oriented approach depth, focused aflatoxin B1-induced transcriptomic alterations distinct states exposure (daily administration 5days followed non-exposed period) human hepatocytes, exploring known interactions human transcription. Several TF-coding genes persistently deregulated washout AFB1. Oncogene MYC identified prominent regulator driver many FFLs, among FFL comprising MYC/HIF1A recurrent. MYC/HIF1A FFL also identified validated independent set master regulator metabolic alterations linked initiation progression carcinogenesis, i.e. Warburg effect, possibly result persistent intracellular alterations arising AFB1 exposure (nuclear mitochondrial DNA damage, oxidative stress, transcriptional activation secondary messengers). summary, analysis shows involvement FFLs modulators gene expression suggestive carcinogenic potential even termination exposure.
