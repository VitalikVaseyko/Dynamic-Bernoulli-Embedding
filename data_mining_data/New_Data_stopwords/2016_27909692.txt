 Cells open, highly ordered systems far away equilibrium. reason, first function cell prevent permanent threat disintegration described thermodynamic laws preserve highly ordered cell characteristics structures, cell cycle, metabolism. context, three basic categories play central role: energy, information, matter. three categories equally important cell reciprocally dependent. therefore suggest energy loss (e.g., impaired mitochondria) disturbance information (e.g., mutations aneuploidy) changes composition distribution matter (e.g., micro-environmental changes toxic agents) irreversibly disturb molecular mechanisms, leading increased local entropy cellular functions structures. terms physics, changes normally highly ordered reaction probabilities lead state irreversibly biologically imbalanced, thermodynamically stable. primary change-independent initiator-now provokes drives complex interplay availability energy, composition, distribution matter increasing information disturbance dependent upon reactions try overcome stabilize intracellular, irreversible disorder described entropy. return original ordered state possible thermodynamic reasons, cells either die else persist metastable state. latter case, enter self-driven adaptive evolutionary process generates progression disordered cells results broad spectrum progeny different characteristics. Possibly, 1 day, one cells show autonomous aggressive behavior-it cancer cell.
