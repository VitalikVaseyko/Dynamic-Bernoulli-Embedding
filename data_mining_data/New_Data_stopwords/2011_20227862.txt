 BACKGROUND AIMS: Curcumin reported lower plasma lipids glucose diabetic rats, decrease body weight obese rats, may partly due increased fatty acid oxidation utilization skeletal muscle. METHODS RESULTS: Diabetic rats induced high-fat diet plus streptozotocin (STZ, 30 mg/kg BW) fed diet containing 50, 150, 250 mg/kg BW curcumin 7 wk. Curcumin dose-dependently decreased plasma lipids glucose dose 150 mg/kg BW appeared adequate produce significant effect. Curcumin supplementation reduced glucose insulin tolerance measured areas curve. L6 myotubes treated palmitate (0.25 mmol/L) presence different levels curcumin 24 h vitro experiment. Curcumin 10 mumol/L adequate cause significant increase 2-deoxy-[(3)H]d-glucose uptake L6 myotubes. Curcumin up-regulated expression phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), CD36, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, down-regulated expression pyruvate dehydrogenase 4 phosphorylated glycogen synthase (GS) vivo vitro studies. Moreover, curcumin increased phosphorylated acetyl COA carboxylase L6 myotubes. effects curcumin enzymes except GS suppressed AMPK inhibitor, Compound C. LKB1, upstream kinase AMPK, activated curcumin inhibited radicicol, LKB1 destabilizer. CONCLUSION: Curcumin improves muscular insulin resistance increasing oxidation fatty acid glucose, is, least part, mediated LKB1-AMPK pathway.
