 Leaves transgenic tobacco plants expressing yeast-derived invertase apoplast develop clearly demarcated green bleached sectors mature. green areas contain low levels soluble sugars starch turned daily basis, high rates photosynthesis low rates respiration. pale areas accumulate carbohydrate, photosynthesis inhibited, respiration increases. provides model system investigate "sink" regulation photosynthetic metabolism accumulating carbohydrate. inhibition photosynthesis accompanied decrease ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate glycerate-3-phosphate, increase triosephosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. extracted activities ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase NADP-glyeraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase decreased. activity sucrose-phosphate synthase remained high increased, increased portion photosynthate partitioned soluble sugars rather starch, pale areas showed oscillations transitions darkness saturating light saturating CO2. increased rate respiration accompanied increased level hexose-phosphates, triose-phosphates fructose-1,6-bisphosphate glycerate-3-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate decreased pyruvate increased. activities pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase pyrophosphate: fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase increased two- four-fold. conclude increased level carbohydrate leads decreased level Calvin-cycle enzymes and, thence, inhibition photosynthesis. also leads increased level glycolytic enzymes and, thence, stimulation respiration. changes enzymes important middle- long-term adjustments high carbohydrate levels leaf fine regulation due depletion inorganic phosphate high levels phosphorylated metabolites.
