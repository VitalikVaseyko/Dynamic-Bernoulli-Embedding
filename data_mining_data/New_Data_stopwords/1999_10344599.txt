 study examines effects 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] SH-SYSY human neuroblastoma cells cultured presence medium containing varying concentrations calcium (0.1, 0.9, 1.4, 1.8 mM). Pyruvate kinase activity assayed SH-SY5Y cells incubated variable calcium medium without 1, 10 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 48 h. enzyme levels showed significant increase comparison control, cells incubated 100 nM hormone presence 0.1 mM calcium, pyruvate kinase activity decreased, cells treated 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 presence 1.8 mM calcium. proliferative activity SH-SY5Y dependent extracellular concentration calcium, highest 1.8 mM calcium completely absent 0.1 mM calcium. presence 1,25(OH)2D3, three concentrations used 48 h incubation, significant decrease cell number always observed, without direct correlation 1,25(OH)2D3 effect calcium concentration medium. [3H]Thymidine incorporation SH-SY5Y cells significantly increased comparison control, 48 h incubation 1, 10 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 carried presence 0.1 mM calcium, while, calcium concentrations, hormone cause significant change parameter. treatment SH-SYSY cells 1 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 48 h affect cell morphology, 0.1 mM calcium present, while, medium containing 1.8 mM calcium, treated cells showed slight trend differentiation. differentiating effect 10 microM all-trans retinoic acid, even incomplete 48 h treatment, observed cultures grown 1.8 mM calcium, comparison maintained 0.1 mM calcium.
