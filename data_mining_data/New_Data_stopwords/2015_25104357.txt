 mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays crucial role regulation glucose homoeostasis mammalian cells. PDC flux depends catalytic activity important enzyme component pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH kinase inactivates PDC phosphorylating PDH specific serine residues, including Ser-293, whereas dephosphorylation PDH PDH phosphatase restores PDC activity. current understanding suggests Ser-293 phosphorylation PDH impedes active site accessibility substrate pyruvate. Here, report phosphorylation tyrosine residue Tyr-301 also inhibits PDH alpha 1 (PDHA1) blocking pyruvate binding novel mechanism addition Ser-293 phosphorylation. addition, found multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylate PDHA1 Tyr-301, Tyr-301 phosphorylation PDHA1 common EGF-stimulated cells well diverse human cancer cells primary leukemia cells human patients. Moreover, expression phosphorylation-deficient PDHA1 Y301F mutant cancer cells resulted increased oxidative phosphorylation, decreased cell proliferation hypoxia, reduced tumor growth mice. Together, findings suggest phosphorylation distinct serine tyrosine residues inhibits PDHA1 distinct mechanisms impact active site accessibility, act concert regulate PDC activity promote Warburg effect.
