 Pyruvate placed experimental CPD-adenine (0.25 mM) blood preservative mixtures four concentrations ranging 40 320 mM. 320 mM pyruvate preservative, 2,3-DPG levels elevated normal six weeks whole blood storage 4 C. lower pyruvate concentrations maintained elevated normal 2,3-DPG levels less time: four weeks 160 mM, two weeks 80 mM, one week less 40 mM control. ATP values best maintained control. higher pyruvate concentrations resulted rapid decreases ATP. However, even 320 mM pyruvate cause ATP fall 2 microM/gm Hb. higher pyruvate concentrations produced maintained higher pH storage. hand, 2,3-DPG levels increased pyruvate first week storage pH decreasing rapidly. could result oxidation NADH NAD. high pyruvate concentration maintained elevated 2,3-DPG levels throughout six weeks might simulating effect reported pyruvate kinase-deficient red blood cells, blockage glycolysis step preventing 2,3-DPG catabolism.
