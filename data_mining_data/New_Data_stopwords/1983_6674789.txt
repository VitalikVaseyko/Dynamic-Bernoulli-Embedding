 experimental clinical studies done metabolic viewpoint elucidate characteristics myonephropathic-metabolic syndrome. experimental dogs femoral arteries ligated two third femoral muscles divided, aldolase myoglobin showed remarkable increase without significant changes electrolytes. Slight increase GPT GOT observed. Amino acids showed elevation urea, taurin, leucin, isoleucin, valine, threonine, 3-methylhistidine, phenylalanine, histidine, lysine, methionine, tyrosine anserin decrease glutamine, alanine, glycine, proline, carnosine, citrullin arginine. patients acute arterial occlusion, potassium, GOT, LDH, CPK, lactate pyruvate increased moderately myoglobin showed remarkable increase aldolase slight increase. Amino acids showed remarkable increase 3-methylhistidine beta-amino-isobutyric acid moderate increase phenylalanine arginine. results revealed measurement free amino acid concentration, especially methylhistidine well myoglobin, pyruvate, lactate enzymes might great help predict prognosis patients acute arterial occlusion extremities.
