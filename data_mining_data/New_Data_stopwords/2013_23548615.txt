 purpose study examine fat oxidation affected menopausal status investigate could related oxidative capacity skeletal muscle. Forty-one healthy women enrolled cross-sectional study [premenopausal (n = 19), perimenopausal (n = 8), postmenopausal (n = 14)]. Estimated insulin sensitivity obtained oral glucose tolerance test. Body composition measured dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry magnetic resonance imaging. Fat oxidation energy expenditure measured acute exercise bout 45 min ergometer biking 50% maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2 max). Muscle biopsies vastus lateralis quadriceps muscle obtained immediately exercise bout. Postmenopausal women 33% [confidence interval (CI) 95%: 12-55] lower whole body fat oxidation (P = 0.005) 19% (CI 95%: 9-22) lower energy expenditure (P = 0.02) exercise, well 4.28 kg lower lean body mass (LBM) premenopausal women. Correction LBM reduced differences fat oxidation 23% (P = 0.05), whereas differences energy expenditure disappeared (P = 0.22). differences groups found mRNA [carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (beta-HAD), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, citrate synthase (CS), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha)], protein [phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), vascular endothelial growth factor, pyruvate dehydrogenase-1Ealpha, cytochrome oxidase I], enzyme activities (beta-HAD, CS) resting skeletal muscle, except increased protein level cytochrome c post- perimenopausal women relative premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women demonstrated trend blunted exercise-induced increase phosphorylation AMPK compared premenopausal women (P = 0.06). conclude reduced whole body fat oxidation menopause associated reduced LBM.
