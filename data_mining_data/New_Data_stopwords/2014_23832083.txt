 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) key negative regulator insulin signalling. Hepatic PTP1B deficiency, using Alb-Cre promoter drive Ptp1b deletion birth mice, improves glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity lipid metabolism. aim study investigate therapeutic potential decreasing liver PTP1B levels obese insulin-resistant adult mice. METHODS: Inducible Ptp1b liver-specific knockout mice generated using SA-Cre-ER(T2) mice crossed Ptp1b floxed (Ptp1b(fl/fl)) mice. Mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) 12 weeks induce obesity insulin resistance. Tamoxifen administered HFD induce liver-specific deletion Ptp1b (SA-Ptp1b(-/-) mice). Body weight, glucose homeostasis, lipid homeostasis, serum adipokines, insulin signalling endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress examined. RESULTS: Despite significant change body weight relative HFD-fed Ptp1b(fl/fl) control mice, HFD-fed SA-Ptp1b(-/-) mice exhibited reversal glucose intolerance determined improved glucose pyruvate tolerance tests, decreased fed fasting blood glucose insulin levels, lower HOMA insulin resistance, circulating leptin, serum liver triacylglycerols, serum NEFA decreased HFD-induced ER stress. associated decreased glycogen synthase, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2alpha kinase 3, eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 2 phosphorylation, decreased expression Pepck. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Inducible liver-specific PTP1B knockdown reverses glucose intolerance improves lipid homeostasis HFD-fed obese insulin-resistant adult mice. suggests knockdown liver PTP1B individuals already obese/insulin resistant may relatively rapid, beneficial therapeutic effects.
