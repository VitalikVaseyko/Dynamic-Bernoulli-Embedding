 Recent observations suggest growth factor withdrawal promote cell death part modulation basic cellular bioenergetic pathways, including inhibition glucose uptake glycolytic metabolism. Whether DNA damage-initiated cell death pathways also involve bioenergetic deregulation studied previously. Subtractive suppressive hybridization used identify changes gene expression murine cells exposure genotoxic stimuli, including cisplatin, etoposide, gamma-radiation. Among genes identified screen several regulate glycolytic metabolism. Enzymes catalyze key regulatory steps glycolysis, including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, appeared coordinately down-regulated genotoxic exposure. Northern blotting confirmed changes gene expression occur within 4 h exposure several DNA-damaging agents. Genotoxic exposure found similarly inhibit expression glut-1 glut-3, genes encode critical regulators glucose uptake. Direct measurement glycolytic rate oxygen consumption confirmed genotoxic exposure resulted suppression anaerobic aerobic metabolism. Many metabolic changes mimic observed growth factor withdrawal. Together, observations suggest multiple apoptotic triggers, including growth factor withdrawal genotoxic exposure, suppress cellular bioenergetic pathways. Mitochondrial responses resulting rapid decrease metabolic substrates may play important role initiation apoptotic cell death.
