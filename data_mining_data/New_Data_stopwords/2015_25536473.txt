 Dichloroacetate (DCA) small molecule inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) constrain aerobic glycolytic pathway observed many cancer cells effectively kill limited cytotoxicity normal cells. previously showed DCA induced cytoprotective effect different human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines anoxic conditions. study, investigated molecular metabolic changes may providing cytoprotection. expression profiles PDK isoforms SW480 LS174T cells along subsequent changes pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation assessed following DCA exposure. Changes mitochondrial activity subsequent glucose consumption lactate production examined. show evidence differential regulation PDH phosphorylation different human CRC cells leading differences mitochondrial activity following DCA exposure. However, effects lead significant changes cellular metabolism growth. conclusion, DCA may beneficial treating subset tumor types based molecular profiles different PDK isoforms.
