 Fetal adult erythrocyte characteristics studied serially 30-mo-old female juvenile chronic myelocytic leukemia. presentation erythrocytes exhibited predominantly fetal characteristics indicated 69% hemoglobin F (HbF), 1.1% hemoglobin A2 (HbA2), absent antigen, fetal levels erythrocyte enzymes, carbonic anhydrase II, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; 100% erythrocytes present contained HbF. However, Orskov-Jacobs-Stewart hemolysis demonstrated least one adult characteristic present. Seven months later HbF 17%; antigen carbonic anhydrase increased adult levels. number cells containing HbF decreased 30%. studies indicated least three new populations red cells present 7 mo previously detected. Two populations exhibited mixture fetal adult characteristics. findings suggested ongoing disturbance regulatory mechanisms responsible variable expression fetal versus adult erythrocyte characteristics.
