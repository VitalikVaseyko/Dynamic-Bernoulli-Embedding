 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cancer proceed via one common molecular mechanisms: metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis-corresponding activation Warburg effect-occurs diseases. findings reported paper demonstrate that, early phase apoptosis, glucose metabolism enhanced, i.e. key proteins internalize metabolize glucose-glucose transporter, hexokinase phosphofructokinase-are up-regulated, concomitance parallel decrease oxygen consumption mitochondria increase L-lactate accumulation. Reversal glycolytic phenotype occurs presence dichloroacetate, inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase enzyme, speeds apoptosis cerebellar granule cells, reawakening mitochondria modulating glycolytic enzymes. Loss adaptive advantage afforded aerobic glycolysis, occurs late phase apoptosis, exacerbates pathological processes underlying neurodegeneration, leading inevitably cell death. conclusion, data propose aerobic, i.e. Warburg effect, essentially due protective numbness mitochondria, anaerobic glycolysis, rather due mitochondrial impairment, characterize entire time frame apoptosis, early late phase, mimics development AD.
