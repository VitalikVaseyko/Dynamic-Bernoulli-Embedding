 Dietary fiber suggested suppress colorectal cancer development, although mechanisms contributing beneficial effect remain elusive. Butyrate, fermentation product fiber, shown anti-proliferative pro-apoptotic effects colorectal cancer cells. metabolic fate butyrate cell important determining whether, acts HDAC inhibitor consumed short-chain fatty acid. Non-cancerous colonocytes utilize butyrate primary energy source whereas cancerous colonocytes increase glucose utilization Warburg effect. study, show butyrate oxidation decreased cancerous colonocytes compared non-cancerous colonocytes. demonstrate colorectal cancer cells utilize carnitine-dependent carnitine-independent mechanism contributes butyrate oxidation. carnitine-dependent mechanism contingent butyrate concentration. Knockdown CPT1A colorectal cancer cells abolishes butyrate oxidation. terms selectivity, carnitine-dependent mechanism regulated butyrate oxidation, acetate propionate oxidation carnitine-independent. Carnitine decreased action butyrate HDAC inhibitor suppressed induction H3 acetylation butyrate colorectal cancer cells. Thus, diminished oxidation butyrate associated decreased HDAC inhibition histone acetylation. relation mechanism, find dichloroacetate, decreases phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase, increased butyrate oxidation effect carnitine-dependent. conclusion, data suggest colorectal cancer cells decrease butyrate oxidation inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase, carnitine-dependent, provide insight butyrate shows selective effects toward colorectal cancer cells.
