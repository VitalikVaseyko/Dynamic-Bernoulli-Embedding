 Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens major butyrate-forming species bovine ovine rumen. enzymology butyrate formation pyruvate investigated cell-free extracts B. fibrisolvens D1. Pyruvate owas oxidized acetylcoenzyme (CoA) presence CoA.SH benzyl viologen flavin nucleotides. bacterium uses thiolase, beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, crotonase, crotonyl-CoA reductase form butyryl-CoA acetyl-CoA. Reduction acetoacetyl-CoA beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA faster NADH NADPH. Crotonyl-CoA reduced butyryl-CoA NADH, NADPH, presence flavin nucleotides. Reduction flavin nucleotides NADH much slower flavin-dependent reduction crotonyl-CoA. indicates flavoproteins rather free flavin participated reduction crotonyl-CoA. Butyryl-CoA converted butyrate phosphate butyryl transferase butyrate kinase.
