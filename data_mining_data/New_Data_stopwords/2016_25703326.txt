 Upregulation embryonic M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) emerges critical player cancer development metabolism, yet underlying mechanism PKM2 overexpression remains elucidated. demonstrate IGF-1/IGF-IR regulates PKM2 expression enhancing HIF-1alpha-p65 complex binding PKM2 promoter. PKM2 expression regulated miR-148a/152 suppression. PKM2 directly interacts NF-kappaB p65 subunit promote EGR1 expression regulating miR-148a/152 feedback circuit normal cells, cancer cells DNA hypermethylation miR-148a miR-152 gene promoters. silencing miR-148a/152 contributes overexpression PKM2, NF-kappaB or/and IGF-IR cancer cells. show disruption PKM2/NF-kappaB/miR-148a/152 feedback loop regulate cancer cell growth angiogenesis, also associated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype, may clinical implication providing novel biomarker(s) TNBC potential therapeutic target(s) future.
