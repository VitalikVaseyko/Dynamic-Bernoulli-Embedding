 8 year-old female infant clinical pathological characteristics progressive muscular dystrophy mitochondrial myopathy described. maternal cousin clinical pathological findings Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Since patient markedly elevated serum CK calf muscle hypertrophy, muscle biopsied diagnosed female DMD age 5 years. generalized tonic-clonic convulsions alternate hemiconvulsions recent 4 years brought hospital. admission, mild generalized muscle atrophy weakness predominantly proximal limbs. lactate pyruvate levels serum cerebrospinal fluid elevated, metabolic acidosis. Serum CK elevated 4464 IU/L. Brain CT MRI showed expanding arachnoid cyst left middle fossa cranium. biopsied left biceps crachii muscle, addition numerous ragged-red fibers, active muscular fiber necrosis regeneration interstitial fibrosis similar seen progressive muscular dystrophy. Biochemically, decrease defect respiratory chain enzymes detected. electron microscopy, large number fibers contained aggregates giant mitochondria proliferated complicated cristae. Scattered throughout necrotic muscle fibers filled phagocytes regenerating fibers. patient diagnostic features mitochondrial encephalomyopathy progressive muscular dystrophy. supposed patient provided interesting evidences study relationship mitochondrial myopathy progressive muscular dystrophy.
