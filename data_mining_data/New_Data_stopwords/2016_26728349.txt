Reduced erythrocyte pyruvate kinase activity asymptomatic parents provided diagnostic clues mutation screening PKLR gene revealed one child compound heterozygote novel paternally derived 5-bp deletion promoter region (c.-88_-84delTCTCT) maternally derived missense mutation exon nine (c.1174G>A; p.Ala392Thr). second child compound heterozygote two novel missense mutations, namely paternally derived exon ten c.1381G>A (p.Glu461Lys) maternally derived exon seven c.907-908delCC (p.Pro303GlyfsX12) variant.
