 constructed novel ATP amplification reactor using continuous-flow system, allowed us increase sensitivity quantitative bioluminescence assay controlling number ATP amplification cycles. previously developed bioluminescence assay coupled ATP amplification using batch system. However, difficult control number amplification cycles. study, ATP amplification performed using continuous-flow system, significant linear correlations amplified luminescence initial ATP concentration observed. performing four cycles continuous-flow ATP amplification, gradient amplification 1.87(N). Whereas lower quantifiable level 500 pM without amplification, values low 50 pM ATP could measured amplification. sensitivity thus increased 10-fold, improvements expected additional amplification cycles. continuous-flow system thus effectively increased sensitivity quantitative bioluminescence assay.
