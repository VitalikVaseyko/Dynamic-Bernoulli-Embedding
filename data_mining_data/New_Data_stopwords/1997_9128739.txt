 Site-directed mutagenesis cis-regulatory elements 5' flanking region rat pyruvate kinase gene revealed two three GC boxes (-133/-124 -48/-39) involved stimulation core promoter (-35/+46). two regions also protected DNaseI footprinting assays. Sp1 Sp3 identified binding proteins three GC boxes supershift experiments. Cotransfections Drosophila SL2 cells revealed strong stimulatory function Sp1 synergistic effect Sp3 Sp1 activation pyruvate kinase promoter. inhibitory effect Sp3 detected. data indicate binding Sp1 two GC boxes required full promoter activity pyruvate kinase gene thus contributes observed cell-cycle-dependent expression enzyme proliferating rat thymocytes.
