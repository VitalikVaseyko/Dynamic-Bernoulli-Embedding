 Pyruvate kinase spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.) leaves consists two isoforms, separable blue agarose chromatography. isoforms share similar pH profiles substrate alternate nucleotide K(m) values. addition, isoforms inhibited oxalate ATP activated AMP. isoforms differ response three key metabolites; citrate, aspartate, glutamate. first isoform similar previously reported plant pyruvate kinases sensitivity citrate inhibition. K(i) inhibition 1.2 millimolar citrate. second isoform affected citrate regulated aspartate glutamate. Aspartate activator K(a) 0.05 millimolar, glutamate inhibitor K(i) 0.68 millimolar. pyruvate kinase properties previously reported. Based considerations, suggest activity first isoform regulated respiratory metabolism. second isoform, contrast, may regulated demand carbon skeletons use ammonia assimilation.
