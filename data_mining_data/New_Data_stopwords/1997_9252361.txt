 Pyruvate kinase M1, non-allosteric isozyme, converted allosteric enzyme replacement amino acid intersubunit contact. substitution Ala-398 Arg resulted pronounced allosteric enzyme. Hill coefficient substrate concentration giving one-half Vmax mutant respect phosphoenolpyruvate 2.7 0.41 mM, respectively, whereas values wild type 1.0 0.049 mM. mutation, however, gave rise minor effects apparent values Km ADP Vmax. Furthermore, contrast wild-type enzyme, mutant activated fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate. Hill coefficient mutant longer increased allosteric inhibitor, L-phenylalanine, indicating equilibrium unligated enzyme largely shifted toward T-state. results suggest Ala-398 one critical residues allowing enzyme prefer R-state allosteric regulation pyruvate kinase involves amino acid residues intersubunit contact.
