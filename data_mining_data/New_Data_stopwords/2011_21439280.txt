 Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) knockout (TKO) mice exhibit impaired response fasting. Herein, showed activation adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase cellular AMP levels diminished heart soleus muscle gastrocnemius muscle fasting TKO mice. Similarly, glycogen content fasted TKO mice increased oxidative muscles different glycolytic muscles. data suggest Txnip deficiency higher impact oxidative muscle glycolytic muscles provide new insights metabolic role Txnip.
