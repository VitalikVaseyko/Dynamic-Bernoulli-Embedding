 Tungstate orally administered 7.5-week-old male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats already showed moderate hyperglycemia (180 +/- 16 mg/dl). animals became normoglycemic approximately 10 days. Then, glycemia started rise again, although reach initial values day 24, levels stabilized approximately 200 mg/dl duration experiment. Untreated ZDF rats showed steadily increased blood glucose levels 7.5 10 weeks age, reached maximum value 450 +/- 19 mg/dl, maintained throughout experiment. addition, tolerance intraperitoneal glucose load improved treated diabetic rats. Serum levels triglycerides elevated untreated diabetic rats compared lean counterparts (ZLC). liver diabetic animals, glucokinase (GK), glycogen phosphorylase (GPa), liver-pyruvate kinase (L-PK), fatty acid synthase (FAS) activities decreased 81, 30, 54, 35%, respectively, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) levels increased 240%. Intracellular glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) decreased 40%, whereas glycogen levels remained unaffected. Tungstate treatment rats induced 42% decrease serum levels triglycerides normalized hepatic G6P concentrations, GPa activity, PEPCK levels. GK activity treated diabetic rats increased 50% values untreated ZLC rats. L-PK FAS activity increased higher values untreated lean rats (1.7-fold L-PK 2.4-fold FAS). Hepatic glycogen levels 55% higher untreated diabetic healthy rats. Tungstate treatment significantly change phosphotyrosine protein profile primary cultured hepatocytes diabetic animals. data suggest tungstate administration ZDF rats causes considerable reduction glycemia, mainly partial restoration hepatic glucose metabolism decrease lipotoxicity.
