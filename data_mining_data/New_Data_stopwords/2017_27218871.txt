 examine potential role lactate signalling molecule skeletal muscle, performed global gene expression analysis mouse gastrocnemius muscle, 3 h lactate administration using Affymetrix GeneChip system (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif., USA). Among top 15 genes largest fold change, increased expression Ppargc1a, Pdk4, Ucp3 confirmed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. findings suggest lactate serves signal upregulating genes related mitochondrial function.
