 cultured normal rat liver epithelial cells, specific activity and/or isozyme expression NADH-diaphorase (NADH-D), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (AP) markedly dependent growth state cultures. Proliferating, preconfluent cells higher specific activities PK, NADH-D, G6PD lower activities GGT AP stationary confluent cells. Addition epidermal growth factor [EGF] media proliferating cells enhanced specific activities PK, NADH-D, G6PD, GGT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cells, specific activity AP markedly depressed. increase activity PK GGT EGF appeared involve new protein synthesis, whereas effect EGF AP appeared involve EGF-directed suppression synthesis form AP produced exclusively cells confluent cultures. Furthermore, preconfluent cells responsive action EGF AP confluent cells, i.e., EGF-mediated decrease AP activity seen lower concentration preconfluent confluent cells. Paradoxically, confluent cells exhibited two-to threefold higher capacity bind [125 I]EGF increase surface receptor number. results study indicate enzymatic biochemical studies performed cultured cells must take account growth-state cultures. EGF modulate enzyme activity growing nongrowing cells; one effect EGF maintain higher activity glycolytic enzymes, suggesting EGF EGF-like factors may contribute high rate glycolysis certain neoplasms.
