 Warburg effect, one hallmarks cancer cells, characterized metabolic switch mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis. recent years, increased expression level pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) found culprit enhanced aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. However, agent inhibiting aerobic glycolysis targeting PKM2. study, found Oleanolic acid (OA) induced switch PKM2 PKM1, consistently, abrogated Warburg effect cancer cells. Suppression aerobic glycolysis OA mediated PKM2/PKM1 switch. Furthermore, mTOR signaling found inactivated OA-treated cancer cells, mTOR inhibition required effect OA PKM2/PKM1 switch. Decreased expression c-Myc-dependent hnRNPA1 hnRNPA1 responsible OA-induced switch PKM isoforms. Collectively, identified OA antitumor compound suppresses aerobic glycolysis cancer cells potential PKM2 may developed important target aerobic glycolysis pathway developing novel anticancer agents.
