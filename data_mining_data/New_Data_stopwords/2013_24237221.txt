 Tumor cells, including leukemic cells, remodel bioenergetic system favor aerobic glycolysis. process called "the Warburg effect" offers attractive pharmacological target preferentially eliminate malignant cells. addition, recent results show metabolic changes linked tumor immune evasion. Mouse models demonstrate importance metabolic remodeling leukemogenesis. leukemias, although treatable, remain incurable resistance chemotherapy produces elevated percentage relapse leukemia cases. Several groups targeted specific metabolism leukemia cells preclinical clinical studies improve prognosis patients, i.e. using L-asparaginase treat pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Additional metabolic drugs currently used treat diseases tumors could also exploited leukemia, based preclinical studies. Finally, discuss potential use several metabolic drugs combination therapies, including immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) immune cell-based therapies, increase efficacy reduce side effects treatment hematological cancers.
