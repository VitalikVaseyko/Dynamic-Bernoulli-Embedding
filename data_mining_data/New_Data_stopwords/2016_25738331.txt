 Plant cytokinins auxins recently proposed novel cancer therapies, proceed via different mechanisms; however, combined use investigated. best knowledge, present study first show cytokinin ortho-methoxytopolin-riboside (MeoTR) strongly inhibited proliferation HeLa cells, effect synergistically enhanced auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), IAA demonstrated cytotoxic effects cells. MeoTR found activate intrinsic extrinsic caspase-dependent pathways, IAA potentiated activation. addition, effects blocked Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK), pan-specific-caspase-inhibitor. IAA increased MeoTR- induced inhibition B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) survivin, whereas IAA-only decreased Bcl-2 expression. MeoTR downregulated phosphorylated (p)-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, p-Akt p-glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, effect potent combination IAA, despite weak effect IAA alone. LY294002, Akt-inhibitor, able increase inhibition p-Akt MeoTR combination treatment. IAA MeoTR increased proportion cells phase independently. However, combination treatment induced increase. addition, IAA MeoTR treatment downregulated protein levels cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) p-CDK2, upregulated protein levels p21 p27. Furthermore, combination treatment enhanced effects, indicating IAA potentiated inhibitory effect MeoTR HeLa cells via cell cycle progression arrest accumulation phase, coupled negative regulation Bcl-2. conclusion, results present study suggested treatment two phytohormones combination, may offer novel therapeutic strategy treatment malignant cervical cancer.
