 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis ATP production (the Warburg effect) macromolecular biosynthesis; also linked therapeutic resistance generally associated compromised respiratory metabolism. Molecular mechanisms underlying radio-resistance linked elevated glycolysis remain incompletely understood. METHODS: stimulated glycolysis using mitochondrial respiratory modifiers (MRMs viz. di-nitro phenol, DNP; Photosan-3, PS3; Methylene blue, MB) established human cell lines (HEK293, BMG-1 OCT-1). Glucose utilization lactate production, levels glucose transporters glycolytic enzymes investigated indices glycolysis. Clonogenic survival, DNA repair cytogenetic damage studied parameters radiation response. RESULTS: MRMs induced glycolysis enhancing levels two important regulators glucose metabolism GLUT-1 HK-II resulted 2 fold increase glucose consumption lactate production. increase glycolysis resulted resistance radiation-induced cell death (clonogenic survival) different cell lines absorbed dose 5 Gy. Inhibition glucose uptake glycolysis (using fasentin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose 3-bromopyruvate) DNP treated cells failed increase clonogenic survival irradiated cells, suggesting radio-resistance linked inhibition mitochondrial respiration glycolysis dependent. Elevated glycolysis also facilitated rejoining radiation-induced DNA strand breaks activating non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) homologous recombination (HR) pathways DNA double strand break repair leading reduction radiation-induced cytogenetic damage (micronuclei formation) cells. CONCLUSIONS: findings suggest enhanced glycolysis generally observed cancer cells may responsible radio-resistance, partly enhancing repair DNA damage.
