 Two open reading frames, YIL042c (PKP1) YGL059w, 25% sequence similarity human pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, shown protein kinase activity. Using GFP fusions, demonstrated proteins localize discrete submitochondrial regions. Strains null mutation loci grew poorly acetate ethanol carbon sources. Doubling times increased ca. 4 h wild-type > 6 h mutants. Growth rates mutants could restored wild-type levels simultaneous disruption PDA1 gene, encoding E1alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. observation pyruvate dehydrogenase activities measured mutant strains wild-type grown glucose acetate suggest slow growth phenotype C2 carbon sources caused futile cycle phosphoenolpyruvate converted back acetyl coenzyme A.
