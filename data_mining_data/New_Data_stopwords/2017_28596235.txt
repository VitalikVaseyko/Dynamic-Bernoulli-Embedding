 Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation major cause metastasis cancers head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); however, whether metabolic enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), mediates EGF-enhanced HNSCC metastasis remains unclear. interest, found EGF induced PDK1 expression HNSCC. Tumor cell transformation induced EGF repressed PDK1 knockdown, down-regulation PDK1 expression inhibition activity significantly blocked EGF-enhanced cell migration invasion. addition, depletion PDK1 impeded EGF-enhanced binding HNSCC cells endothelial cells well metastatic seeding tumor cells lungs. PDK1 depletion inhibited EGF-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, fibronectin expression Rac1/cdc42 activation. Furthermore, PDK1 overexpression induced MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, fibronectin expression Rac1/cdc42 activation. interest, depletion fibronectin inhibited PDK1-enhanced MMP-1-3 MMP-9 expression well Rac1/cdc42 activation tumor invasion. results demonstrate EGF-induced PDK1 expression enhances HNSCC metastasis via activation fibronectin signaling pathway. Inhibition PDK1 may potential strategy treatment EGFR-mediated HNSCC metastasis.-Hsu, J.-Y., Chang, J.-Y., Chang, K.-Y., Chang, W.-C., Chen B.-K.
