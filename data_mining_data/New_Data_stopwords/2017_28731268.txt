 Carbon metabolism Crabtree-negative yeast Pichia pastoris profiled using (13) C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) delineate regulation exponential growth study import two precursors branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, alpha-ketoisovalerate alpha-ketobutyrate. Cells grown aerobic batch cultures containing (a) glucose, (b) glucose along precursors, (c) glucose Val. study provided following new insights. First, (13) C flux ratio analyses central metabolism reveal unexpectedly high anaplerotic supply tricarboxylic acid cycle Crabtree-negative yeast, show substantial fraction glucose catabolism proceeds pentose phosphate pathway. comparison previous flux ratio analyses batch cultures Crabtree-negative Pichia stipitis Crabtree-positive Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate overall regulation central carbon metabolism P. pastoris intermediate P. stipitis S. cerevisiae. Second, excess alpha-ketoisovalerate medium transported cytoplasm indicating P. pastoris lacks suitable transporter. contrast, excess Val efficiently taken largely fulfills demands Val Leu protein synthesis. Third, excess alpha-ketobutyrate transported mitochondria Ile biosynthesis. However, import efficiently inhibit synthesis alpha-ketobutyrate pyruvate indicating P. pastoris optimized evolutionarily take full advantage carbon source. findings direct implications preparing uniformly (2) H,(13) C,(15) N-labeled proteins containing protonated Ile, Val, Leu methyl groups P. pastoris NMR-based structural biology.
