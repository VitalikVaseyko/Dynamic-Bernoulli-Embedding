 BACKGROUND: last decade, transgenic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) NR1-knockdown mouse (NR1(neo-/-)) investigated glutamate hypofunction model schizophrenia. Recent research revealed model also recapitulates cognitive negative symptoms continuum psychiatric diseases, particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASD). previous studies mostly focussed behavioural readouts, molecular characterisation model help identify novel biomarkers potential drug targets. METHODS: Here, used multiplex immunoassay analyses investigate peripheral analyte alterations serum NR1(neo-/-) mice, well combination shotgun label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, bioinformatic pathway analyses, shotgun-based 40-plex selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assay investigate altered molecular pathways frontal cortex hippocampus. findings cross compared identify translatable findings brain periphery. RESULTS: Multiplex immunoassay profiling led identification 29 analytes significantly altered sera NR1(neo-/-) mice. highest magnitude changes found neurotrophic factors (VEGFA, EGF, IGF-1), apolipoprotein A1, fibrinogen. also found decreased levels several chemokines. Following this, LC-MS(E) profiling led identification 48 significantly changed proteins frontal cortex 41 hippocampus. particular, MARCS, mitochondrial pyruvate kinase, CamKII-alpha affected. Based combination protein set enrichment bioinformatic pathway analysis, designed orthogonal SRM-assays validated abnormalities proteins involved synaptic long-term potentiation, myelination, ERK-signalling pathway brain regions. contrast, increased levels proteins involved neurotransmitter metabolism release found frontal cortex abnormalities proteins involved purinergic system found exclusively hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, multi-platform profiling study identified peripheral changes potentially linked central alterations synaptic plasticity neuronal function associated NMDAR-NR1 hypofunction. Therefore, reported proteomic changes may useful translational biomarkers human rodent model drug discovery efforts.
