 epithelial cells isolated rat small intestine incubated presence 1 mM glucose, streptozotocin-induced diabetes reduced, 46 29%, respectively, rates glucose utilization L-lactate formation. effects accompanied significant decrease enterocyte fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration (about 50%) glycolytic flux reaction catalyzed 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase. diminution enterocyte fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels caused diabetes occurred spite increase hexose 6-phosphate concentration, associated reduction amount active form 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase; total activity enzyme significantly modified. Diabetes also caused acceleration rate 3-O-methyl-D-(14C) glucose uptake increased hexokinase activity enterocytes. Lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase activities found significantly different epithelial cells isolated control diabetic animals. results indicate reduction glycolytic flux enterocytes could collaborate increase intestinal glucose absorption diabetic state.
