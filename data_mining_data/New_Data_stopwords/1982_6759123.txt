 effects studied streptozotocin-induced diabetes subsequent insulin administration feeding high fructose diet amount enzyme protein mRNA activity L-type pyruvate kinase rat liver. Diabetes markedly decreased L-type enzyme activity rat liver insulin treatment resulted restoration enzyme activity normal. high fructose diet also increased enzyme activity diabetic rats lesser extent. Immunochemical analysis showed alterations enzyme activity due changes amount immunoreactive enzyme protein. mechanism changes studied assaying level functional mRNA coding enzyme nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate system total RNA isolated rat liver. L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA, expressed percentage total protein synthesized, greatly decreased diabetic rats. Insulin administration resulted recovery mRNA activity normal level within 24 h. lag period accumulation translatable mRNA L-type enzyme 4-5 h. mRNA activity also increased diabetic rats fed high fructose diet. fructose effect, much smaller insulin effect, maximal feeding fructose diet one day. changes approximately comparable changes enzyme activity. Thus, suggested regulations rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase insulin fructose primarily due changes level translatable mRNA enzyme.
