 Hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) specific activities decreased partial hepatectomy sham operation. decreases marked sustained partial hepatectomy. activity changes ensure hepatic carbon flux partial hepatectomy predominantly direction gluconeogenesis. decrease PK specific activity observed partial hepatectomy associated decreased PK activation ratio (activity measured 0.15 mM PEP: activity measured 5.0 mM PEP), hepatic concentrations PEP increased. low hepatic PDHa activity observed first day partial hepatectomy occurred concomitantly increased fatty acid concentration. PDHa activity increased inhibition lipolysis. results indicate carbohydrate utilization unimportant hepatic energy supply liver regeneration. evidence control PK PDH regenerative liver partial hepatectomy differed observed liver unoperated rat.
