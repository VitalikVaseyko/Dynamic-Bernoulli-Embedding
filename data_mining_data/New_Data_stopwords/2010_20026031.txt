 existence pyruvate kinase (PK) pig liver mitochondria shown monitoring photometrically PK reaction solubilised mitochondria either phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP used substrate. distinction cytosolic isoenzyme, mitochondrial PK showed sigmoidal dependence either PEP ADP concentrations. occurrence mitochondrial PK confirmed immunological analysis. Titration digitonin showed mPK restricted matrix. PEP addition mitochondria resulted reduction intramitochondrial NAD(P)+ inhibited either non-penetrant thiol reagent mersalyl arsenite, inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Citrate/oxaloacetate appearance outside mitochondria also occurred result PEP addition PLM. Taken together findings support role PEP triggering fatty acid synthesis via mitochondrial metabolism.
