 Experienced clinicians recognize children appear static cerebral palsy (CP) actually underlying genetic-metabolic disorders. report series patients motor disorders seen children extrapyramidal CP brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities provided important diagnostic clues distinguishing genetic-metabolic disorders causes. One cause static extrapyramidal CP, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy end term gestation, produces characteristic pattern hyperintense signal atrophy putamen thalamus. signal abnormalities atrophy putamen, globus pallidus, caudate point genetic-metabolic diseases, including disorders mitochondrial organic acid metabolism. Progress understanding treating genetic diseases developing brain makes essential diagnose disorders masquerade static CP. Brain magnetic resonance imaging useful diagnostic tool initial evaluation children appear CP.
