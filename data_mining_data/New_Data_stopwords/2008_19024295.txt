 OBJECTIVE: comparative proteomic analysis two human large cell lung cancer strains high metastasis potential (L9981) low metastasis potential (NL9980) conducted. METHODS: total proteins two cell lines separated immobilized pH gradient (IPG )-based two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. differential expression proteins two cell lines analyzed using image analysis software. Thirteen differential expressed proteins identified using in-gel digestion trypsin, peptide extracts prepared MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis Daltonics AutoFlex TOF-TOF LIFT Mass Spectrometer (Bruker). Protein identifications searched NCBInr protein database using Mascot search engine. RESULTS: Protein image analysis indicated 8 protein spots observed L9981, NL9980; 8 protein spots observed NL9980, L9981; 19 protein spots detected L9981 NL9980, 9 showed significantly higher volumes L9981 NL9980 10 showed significantly higher volumes NL9980 L9981. MS biological informatics study found expressions heat shock 70 kD protein 9B precursor, MTHSP75 glutathione synthetas incerased L9981 cells. However, variant P47 protein, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region, enolasel, heat shock protein eukaryotic translation initiation fact 3 down-regulated L9981 cells. Pyruvate kinase (PK) expressed L9981 cells WD-40 repeat protein expressed NL9980 cells. CONCLUSIONS: metastatic lung cancer cell lines display different protein profiles compared non metastatic lung cancer cell lines. identified proteins likely associated tumor metastasis, 4hich could serve basis searching potential prognosis markers lung cancer elucidating mechanisms metastasis lung cancer.
