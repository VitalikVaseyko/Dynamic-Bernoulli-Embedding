 main intention study investigation impact natural biologically active ligands nuclear retinoid/retinoid X receptors (all-trans 9-cis retinoic acid) proteomic pattern human estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. purpose, proteomic strategies based bottom-up method applied. total cell proteins extracted utilizing commercially Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer separated 2D sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D SDS-PAGE). proteins subsequently digested in-gel trypsin characterization achieved MALDI-TOF/TOF. employing PDQuest software, identified 50 proteins affected retinoic acid isomers. information, 9 proteins associated tumor process selected. determined derivatives retinoic acid led significantly reduced level proteins belonging metabolic pathway (e.g. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase 2) cellular processes apoptosis, regulation transcription process epithelial-mesenchymal transition (e.g. annexins, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, vimentin). hand all-trans retinoic acid treatment indicates up-regulated effect heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1.
