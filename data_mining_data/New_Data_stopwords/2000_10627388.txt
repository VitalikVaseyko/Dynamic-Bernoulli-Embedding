 previous studies, increase activity pyruvate kinase (PK) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), increase concentration 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG), alterations osmotic fragility found dogs haemolytic anaemia. changes mainly caused presence immature red cells found regenerative anaemias. present study, parameters evaluated dogs different types anaemia. haematological patterns 40 anaemic dogs analysed define pathogenesis haematological features case. Non-regenerative anaemias could attributed principally chronic diseases haemolysis accompanies early stages canine babesiosis. Regenerative anaemias mainly due haemolysis, cases immune-mediated pathogenesis. PK activity higher regenerative non-regenerative anaemias, G6PDH activity 2,3DPG concentration increased types anaemia. suggests PK activity influenced presence immature red cells, requirements reducing compounds oxygen dependent type anaemia. Abnormalities osmotic fragility detected haemolytic anaemias non-regenerative anaemias reticulocyte percentage, reticulocyte production index (RPI), increased. osmotic fragility could used early indicator erythrocyte regeneration.
