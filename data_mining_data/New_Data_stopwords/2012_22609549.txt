 insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway potent inducer cell proliferation normal development cancer. mechanism occurs, however, completely understood. Hippo signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation via transcriptional co-activator Yorkie/YAP, however signaling inputs regulating Hippo activity fully elucidated. present evidence linking two conserved, oncogenic pathways Drosophila mammalian cells. find activation IIS Yorkie signaling correlate positively hepatocellular carcinoma. show IIS activates Yorkie vivo, Yorkie plays important role ability IIS drive cell proliferation. Interestingly, also find converse--that Yorkie signaling activates components insulin/TOR pathway. sum, crosstalk IIS Yorkie leads coordinated regulation two oncogenic pathways.
