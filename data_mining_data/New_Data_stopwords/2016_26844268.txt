 White matter degeneration pathological hallmark neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Age remains greatest risk factor Alzheimer's prevalence age-related late onset Alzheimer's greatest females. investigated mechanisms underlying white matter degeneration animal model consistent sex greatest Alzheimer's risk. Results analyses demonstrated decline mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production cytosolic-phospholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation female brain aging. Electron microscopic lipidomic analyses confirmed myelin degeneration. increase fatty acids mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism machinery coincident rise brain ketone bodies decline plasma ketone bodies. mechanistic pathway chronologically phased activation, links mitochondrial dysfunction early aging later age development white matter degeneration. catabolism myelin lipids generate ketone bodies viewed systems level adaptive response address brain fuel energy demand. Elucidation initiating factors mechanistic pathway leading white matter catabolism aging female brain provides potential therapeutic targets prevent treat demyelinating diseases Alzheimer's multiple sclerosis. Targeting stages disease associated mechanisms critical.
