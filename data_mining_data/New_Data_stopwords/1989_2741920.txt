 goal present study search criteria allow one distinguish normal individuals heterozygotes well compound heterozygotes pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. residual activity PK heterozygotes 35% 110% normal activity, necessary find methods prove heterozygosity. PK hemolysates 23 patients suffering PK deficiency, 36 paternal maternal enzymes well enzymes five heterozygous four normal siblings together 20 normal individuals, studied according recommendations International Committee Standardization Haematology. following hematological enzyme kinetic parameters serve identify heterozygotes PK deficiency: 1) slight reticulocytosis, 2) up-to-twofold increase intracellular concentrations glucose-6-phosphate erythrocyte, 3) mixed cooperativity phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-binding process PK, 4) decreased nucleotide specificity guanosine diphosphate uridine diphosphate, 5) lowered affinity adenosine diphosphate. significant criterium found heterozygotes mixed cooperativity PEP-binding process caused presence mixture normal mutant PK.
