 Atovaquone FDA-approved anti-malarial drug, first became clinically available year 2000. Currently, main usage treatment pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and/or toxoplasmosis immune-compromised patients. Atovaquone hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogue ubiquinone, also known Co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10). well-tolerated drug cause myelo-suppression. Mechanistically, thought act potent selective OXPHOS inhibitor, targeting CoQ10-dependence mitochondrial complex III. Here, show first time atovaquone also anti-cancer activity, directed Cancer Stem-like Cells (CSCs). specifically, demonstrate atovaquone treatment MCF7 breast cancer cells inhibits oxygen-consumption metabolically induces aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), well oxidative stress. Remarkably, atovaquone potently inhibits propagation MCF7-derived CSCs, IC-50 1 muM, measured using mammosphere assay. Atovaquone also maintains selectivity potency mixed populations CSCs non-CSCs. Importantly, results indicate glycolysis sufficient maintain proliferation CSCs, instead strictly dependent mitochondrial function. addition targeting proliferation CSCs, atovaquone also induces apoptosis CD44+/CD24low/- CSC ALDH+ CSC populations, exposure anchorage-independent conditions 12 hours. However, effect oxygen consumption normal human fibroblasts and, cellular context, behaves anti-inflammatory, consistent fact well-tolerated patients treated infections. Future studies xenograft models human clinical trials may warranted, IC-50 atovaquone's action CSCs (1 muM) >50 times less average serum concentration humans.
