 many studies explored growth Pseudomonas aeruginosa, comparatively focused survival. Previously, reported endogenous phenazines support anaerobic survival P. aeruginosa, yet physiological mechanism underpinning survival unknown. Here, demonstrate phenazine redox cycling enables P. aeruginosa oxidize glucose pyruvate acetate, promotes survival coupling acetate ATP synthesis activity acetate kinase. measuring intracellular NAD(H) ATP concentrations, show survival correlated ATP synthesis, tightly coupled redox homeostasis pyruvate fermentation arginine fermentation. also show ATP hydrolysis required generate proton-motive force using ATP synthase complex fermentation. Together, results suggest phenazines enable maintenance proton-motive force promoting redox homeostasis ATP synthesis. work demonstrates general principle extracellular redox-active molecules, phenazines, broaden metabolic versatility microorganisms facilitating energy generation.
