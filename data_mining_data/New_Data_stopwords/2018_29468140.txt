 Cancer cells rewire metabolism meet biosynthetic energetic demands. characteristic increase glycolysis, i.e., Warburg effect, considered hallmark, supports cancer various ways. attain metabolic reshuffle, cancer cells preferentially re-express M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2, M2-PK) alter quaternary structure generate less-active PKM2 dimers. relatively inactive dimers cause accumulation glycolytic intermediates redirected anabolic pathways. addition, dimeric PKM2 also benefits cancer cells various non-glycolytic moonlight functions, gene transcription, protein kinase activity, redox balance. large body data shown several distinct posttranslation modifications (PTMs) regulate PKM2 way benefits cancer growth, e.g., formation PKM2 dimers. review discusses recent advancements understanding various PTMs benefits impart sustenance cancer. Understanding PTMs PKM2 crucial assess therapeutic potential design novel anticancer strategies.
