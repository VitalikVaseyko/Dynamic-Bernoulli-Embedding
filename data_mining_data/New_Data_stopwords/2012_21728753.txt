 Eumycetoma, chronic granulomatous disease characterized subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses purulent discharge containing grains, remains difficult diagnose treat. Madurella mycetomatis common causative agent eumycetoma. Using serum pool patients active mycetoma, screened M. mycetomatis-specific lambdagt11 cDNA library shown contain 8% cDNA inserts encoding proteins involved glycolysis. Two enzymes, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) pyruvate kinase (PK), produced vitro antigenicity studied bead-based flow cytometry. appeared FBA PK IgG antibodies present eumycetoma patient sera. However, FBA antibody levels found significantly higher eumycetoma patient sera compared healthy Sudanese controls. Furthermore, FBA PK also found expressed hyphae present mycetoma grain. conclusion, study presents two new antigenic proteins M. mycetomatis next translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP): glycolytic enzymes FBA PK. antigens might useful vaccine-candidates prevention mycetoma.
