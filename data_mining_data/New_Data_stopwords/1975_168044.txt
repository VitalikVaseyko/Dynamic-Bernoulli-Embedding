 When, addition suitable substrate, chemical potential applied enzymic process glycolysis respiration, whether solution membrane-bound, components process pass nonequilibrium state, might steady non-steady produces following phenomena: (1) reactants enzymic reaction displaced equilibrium concentration, energy dissipated; (2) Part enzyme transferred transition state catalytic function well isosteric allosteric controlling functions, displaying local gross conformation changes, rate-controlling state generated; (3) cyclic portions process futile events chemical interconversion may occur; (4) self- cross-coupled portions process, oscillation periodic changes states spatial propagation well instabilities may observed; (5) step process, depending rate flux specific enzymic function, varying proportion free energy changes--which concentration-dependent derived overall potential system-is contributed control flux rates. exemplified enzymes bioenergetic pathways.
