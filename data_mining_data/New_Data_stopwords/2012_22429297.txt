 Although improving glucose metabolism inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) may prove beneficial treatment type 2 diabetes diet-induced obesity, may detrimental effects inhibiting fatty acid oxidation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonists often used treat dyslipidemia patients, especially type 2 diabetes. Combinational treatment using PDK4 inhibitor PPARalpha agonists may prove beneficial. However, PPARalpha agonists may less effective presence PDK4 inhibitor PPARalpha agonists induce PDK4 expression. present study, effects clofibric acid, PPARalpha agonist, blood liver lipids determined wild-type PDK4 knockout mice fed high-fat diet. expected, treatment wild-type mice clofibric acid resulted less body weight gain, smaller epididymal fat pads, greater insulin sensitivity, lower levels serum liver triacylglycerol. Surprisingly, rather decreasing effectiveness clofibric acid, PDK4 deficiency enhanced beneficial effects clofibric acid hepatic steatosis, reduced blood glucose levels, prevent positive effects clofibric acid serum triacylglycerols free fatty acids. metabolic effects clofibric acid therefore independent induction PDK4 expression. additive beneficial effects hepatic steatosis may due induction increased capacity fatty acid oxidation partial uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation clofibric acid, reduction capacity fatty acid synthesis result PDK4 deficiency.
