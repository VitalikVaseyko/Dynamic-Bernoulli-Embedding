 homeostasis protein metabolism maintained regulated rates protein biosynthesis degradation living systems. Alterations protein degradation may regulate protein biosynthesis feedback mechanism. Whether change protein biosynthesis modulates protein degradation reported. study, found inhibition protein biosynthesis induced phosphorylation/activation AKT led phosphorylation AKT target substrates, including FoxO1, GSK3alpha/beta, p70S6K, AS160, E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Phosphorylation ribosomal protein S6 also modulated inhibition protein biosynthesis. AKT phosphorylation/activation mediated mainly PI3K pathway blocked PI3K inhibitor LY294002. activated AKT phosphorylated MDM2 Ser(166) promoted degradation tumor suppressor p53. findings suggest inhibition protein biosynthesis alter degradation proteins activation AKT. study reveals novel regulation protein degradation calls caution blocking protein biosynthesis study half-life proteins.
