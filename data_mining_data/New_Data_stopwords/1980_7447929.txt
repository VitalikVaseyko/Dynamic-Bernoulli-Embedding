 Cytoplasmic thioltransferase purified rat liver [Axelsson, Eriksson & Mannervik (1978) Biochemistry 17, 2978--2984] catalyses formation decomposition mixed disulphides proteins glutathione. enzyme found catalyse reversible thiol-disulphide interchange glutathione disulphide crude thiol-containing protein fraction rat liver. finding indicates role thioltransferase regulation 'glutathione status' cell. Specifically, found thioltransferase catalyses reactivation pyruvate kinase rat liver previously inactivated glutathione disulphide. suggested thioltransferase may general role regulatory processes involving thiol-disulphide interchange.
