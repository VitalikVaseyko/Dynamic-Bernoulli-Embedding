 previous study, level parasitemia diminazene aceturate (DA)-resistant B. gibsoni isolate continuously lower wild-type, indicating possible alteration energy metabolism isolate. Therefore, present study, concentrations ATP, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, activities lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase wild-type DA-resistant isolate B. gibsoni measured compared investigate amount energy generation activity glycolysis pathway. result, intracellular ATP glucose concentrations DA-resistant B. gibsoni isolate significantly higher wild-type. Meanwhile, concentrations lactate pyruvate activities lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase DA-resistant B. gibsoni isolate different wild-type. results indicated DA-resistant B. gibsoni isolate contained higher ATP concentration wild-type, activity glycolysis pathway altered DA-resistant B. gibsoni isolate. However, could determine mechanism high energy production DA-resistant B. gibsoni isolate. studies energy metabolism B. gibsoni necessary clarify mechanism high energy production DA-resistant B. gibsoni isolate.
