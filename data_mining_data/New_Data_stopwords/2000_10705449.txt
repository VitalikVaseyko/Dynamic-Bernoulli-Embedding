 Four genes, cbbO, cbbY, cbbA, pyruvate kinase gene (pyk), found downstream ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) genes, cbbLS, thermophilic hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium, Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus (formerly Pseudomonas hydrogenothermophila). cbbO similar norD denitrification gene cluster, cbbY similar cbbY autotrophic bacteria. cbbA encoded fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBP aldolase); however, CbbA little similar CbbA proteins. CbbA overexpressed Escherichia coli, overproduction CbbA detected SDS-PAGE. However, cell extract slightly higher activity cell extract E. coli without cbbA. Phylogenetic analysis showed class II FBP aldolase divided classes IIA IIB, CbbA H. thermoluteolus class IIA. Activities RubisCO FBP aldolase examined autotrophic, mixotrophic, heterotrophic conditions. activities two enzymes regulated independently.
