 longstanding problem rapid inactivation glycolytic pathway skeletal muscle contraction investigated using (31)P NMR spectroscopy computational modelling. Accumulation phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates (hexose monophosphates) cyclic contraction subsequent turnover metabolic recovery measured vivo human quadriceps muscle using dynamic (31)P NMR spectroscopy. concentration hexose monophosphates muscle peaked 40 metabolic recovery maximal contractile work 6.9 +/- 1.3 mm (mean +/- s.d.; n = 8) subsequently declined rate 0.009 +/- 0.001 mm s(1). next tested whether current knowledge kinetic controls glycolytic pathway muscle integrated Lambeth Kushmerick computational model skeletal muscle glycolysis explained experimental data. found model underestimated magnitude deactivation glycolytic pathway resting muscle, resulting depletion glycolytic intermediates substrate oxidative ATP synthesis. Numerical analysis model identified phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase kinetic control sites involved deactivation glycolytic pathway. Ancillary 100-fold inhibition phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase found necessary predict glycolytic intermediate ADP concentrations correctly resting human muscle. Incorporation information model resulted highly improved agreement predicted measured vivo dynamics hexose monophosphates muscle following contraction. concluded silencing glycolytic pathway muscle following contraction likely mediated phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase inactivation time scale seconds minutes, respectively, necessary prevent depletion vital cellular substrates.
