 investigated presence carbonic anhydrase root hypocotyl etiolated soybean using enzymatic, histochemical, immunohistochemical situ hybridization approaches. parallel, used situ hybridization immunolocalization determine expression pattern localization phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. co-localization root tip well central cylinder, suggests large fraction CO(2) may re-introduced C4 compounds. GmPK3 expression, coding cytoplasmic isoform pyruvate kinase, detected different root cell types, suggesting phosphoenolpyruvate-utilizing enzymes involved phosphoenolpyruvate metabolism etiolated soybean roots; case indicative necessary flexibility plant metabolism adopt order compensate various physiological conditions.
