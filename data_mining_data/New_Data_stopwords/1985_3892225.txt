 Rabbit pancreatic islet cytosol catalyzes calcium-activated phosphorylation [gamma 32P]ATP protein molecular weight 57,000 precipitated antipyruvate kinase antibodies. unable demonstrate phosphorylation presence calcium cAMP immediate effect rat pancreatic islet pyruvate kinase activity. finding consistent inability confirm finding others pancreatic islets contain phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (Diabetes, 34:246, 1985). Since carboxykinase catalyzes phosphoenolpyruvate formation pyruvate kinase catalyzes essentially opposite reaction, carboxykinase present beta cell, pyruvate kinase would need inhibited prevent recycling phosphoenolpyruvate.
