 Mixed-function oxidation Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase ascorbate, oxygen, iron previously shown cause inactivation enzyme enhanced susceptibility proteolytic attack variety proteases. One proteases, rat liver, high molecular weight cysteine proteinase degrade native glutamine synthetase neutral pH. Although inactive, oxidized glutamine synthetase preparations used study partially degraded proteinase. subunits degraded acid soluble products detectable intermediates; remaining subunits become susceptible proteolytic attack limited exposure ascorbate mixed-function oxidation system. Several mammalian enzymes known inactivated mixed-function oxidation tested substrates proteinase. Native rabbit muscle enolase pyruvate kinase resistant degradation, oxidatively inactivated forms degraded. Oxidized phosphoglycerate kinase creatine kinase also preferentially degraded. Moreover, trypsin degraded oxidized preparations enzymes faster control preparations. Oxidative inactivation superoxide dismutase hydrogen peroxide caused slight increase susceptibility proteolytic attack, enzyme still relatively resistant degradation cysteine proteinase trypsin. Although oxidation conditions may optimal demonstrating enhanced proteolytic susceptibility, results indicate mixed-function oxidation render mammalian enzymes, well bacterial glutamine synthetase, susceptible degradation. Mixed-function oxidation proteins may mechanism marking intracellular turnover.
