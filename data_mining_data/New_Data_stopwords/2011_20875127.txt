 BACKGROUND: NOL7 candidate tumor suppressor localizes chromosomal region 6p23. locus frequently lost number malignancies, consistent loss NOL7 loss heterozygosity decreased mRNA protein expression observed tumors cell lines. Reintroduction NOL7 cells resulted significant suppression vivo tumor growth modulation angiogenic phenotype. Further, NOL7 observed localize nucleus nucleolus cells. However, mechanisms regulating subcellular localization elucidated. RESULTS: vitro import assay demonstrated NOL7 requires cytosolic machinery active nuclear transport. Using sequence homology prediction algorithms, four putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) identified. NOL7 deletion constructs cytoplasmic pyruvate kinase (PK) fusion proteins confirmed functionality three NLSs. Site-directed mutagenesis PK fusions full-length NOL7 defined minimal functional regions within NLS. characterization revealed NLS2 NLS3 critical rate efficiency nuclear targeting. addition, four basic clusters within NLS2 NLS3 independently capable nucleolar targeting. nucleolar occupancy NOL7 revealed complex balance rapid nucleoplasmic shuttling low nucleolar mobility, suggesting NOL7 may play functional roles compartments. support, targeting nucleolar compartment dependent presence RNA, depletion total RNA rRNA resulted nucleoplasmic shift NOL7. CONCLUSIONS: results identify minimal sequences required active targeting NOL7 nucleus nucleolus. Further, work characterizes relative contribution sequence NOL7 nuclear nucleolar dynamics, subnuclear constituents participate targeting, suggests functional role NOL7 compartments. Taken together, results identify requisite protein domains NOL7 localization, kinetics drive targeting, suggest NOL7 may function nucleus nucleolus.
