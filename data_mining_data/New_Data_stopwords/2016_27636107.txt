 mechanisms signaling pathways coordinated integrated maintenance self-renewal human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) acquisition pluripotency reprogramming still partly understood. CDK1 key regulator mitosis. Recently, CDK1 shown involved regulating self-renewal stem cells, even though mechanistic role CDK1 regulates pluripotency unknown. report, aim understand CDK1 control pluripotency reducing CDK1 activity level effect cell cycle progression. demonstrated high levels CDK1 associated pluripotency stage hESCs; decreased CDK1 activity level without perturbing cell cycle sufficient induce differentiation. CDK1 specifically targets phosphorylation PDK1 consequently activity PI3K/Akt effectors ERK GSK3beta. Evidence reversion inactive CDK1-mediated differentiation inhibition Akt signaling effectors suggests CDK1-PDK1-PI3K/Akt kinase cascade functional signaling pathway pluripotency hESCs. Moreover, cyclin B1-CDK1 complexes promote somatic reprogramming efficiency, probably regulating maturation induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), cyclin B1 stimulates higher cellular level LIN28A, suggesting monitoring iPSC factors could new path enhancement reprogramming efficiency. Together, demonstrate essential role CDK1-PDK1-PI3K/Akt kinase signaling pathway regulation self-renewal, differentiation, somatic reprogramming, provides novel kinase cascade mechanism pluripotency control acquisition.
