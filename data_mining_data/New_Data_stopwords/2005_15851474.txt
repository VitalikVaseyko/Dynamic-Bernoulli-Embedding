 nitration protein tyrosine residues represents important post-translational modification development, oxidative stress, biological aging. rationalize physiological changes modifications, actual protein targets nitration must identified proteomic methods. several studies used proteomics screen 3-nitrotyrosine-containing proteins vivo, studies failed prove nitration unambiguously actual localization 3-nitrotyrosine specific sequences mass spectrometry. paper applied sequential solution isoelectric focusing SDS-PAGE proteomic characterization specific 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences nitrated target proteins vivo using nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Specifically, analyzed proteins skeletal muscle 34-month-old Fisher 344/Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats, well accepted animal model biological aging. identified 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences 11 proteins, including cytosolic creatine kinase, tropomyosin 1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, myosin light chain, aldolase A, pyruvate kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, actinin, gamma-actin, ryanodine receptor 3, neurogenic locus notch homolog. creatine kinase neurogenic locus notch homolog, two 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences identified, i.e. positions 14 20 creatine kinase positions 1175 1205 neurogenic locus notch homolog. selectivity vivo nitration creatine kinase Tyr14 Tyr20 correspond product selectivity vitro, exclusively Tyr82 nitrated creatine kinase exposed peroxynitrite. latter experiments demonstrate vitro exposure isolated protein peroxynitrite may always good model mimic protein nitration vivo.
