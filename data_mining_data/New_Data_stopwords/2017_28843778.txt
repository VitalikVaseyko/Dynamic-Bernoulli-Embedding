 Mitophagy, special type autophagy, plays important role mitochondria quality control cellular homeostasis. study, examined molecular mechanism mitophagy induction benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, acts prosurvival response apoptotic cell death. study showed B[a]P displayed higher cytotoxicity autophagy-deficient HaCaT cells compared control. Further, showed B[a]P triggered Beclin-1-dependent autophagy mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Moreover, study indicated B[a]P-induced autophagy initiated activation cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) HaCaT cells. Intriguingly, B[a]P-induced Beclin-1-mediated mitophagy suppressed CYP1B1 AhR knockdown HaCaT cells, indicating crucial role B[a]P activation mitophagy induction regulate cell death. B[a]P shown increase mitochondrial dysfunction decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting depletion ATP level along inhibition oxygen consumption rate HaCaT cells. Importantly, supplementation methyl pyruvate compensated B[a]P-induced drop ATP level mitigated reactive oxygen species burden autophagy. Mechanistically, B[a]P inhibited manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity found activated mitochondrial CYP1B1 interacted MnSOD, inflicting mitophagy protect B[a]P-induced apoptosis. summary, study reveals mitophagy induction cellular protection mechanism B[a]P-triggered toxicity carcinogenesis.
