 influence temperature, K+, Mg2+ fructose 1,6-bisphosphate human red cell pyruvate kinase investigated. Kinetic measurements 4 degrees C 43 degrees C revealed remarkable influence temperature allosteric behaviour enzyme. transition region 15 degrees C 20 degrees C (as obtained Arrhenius plot) enzyme shows non-cooperative behaviour, deduced Michaelis-Menten, Hill Scatchard plots. temperatures 20 degrees C cooperativity increases rising temperature. effect becomes even pronounced higher temperatures upon addition increasing amounts K+ Mg2+ accompanied slight decrease reaction velocity. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, abolishes cooperativity every temperature salt concentration measured. Difficulties arise evaluating correct values V, Km Hill coefficient nH cooperative systems met using computer program Wieker, Johannes Hess, especially designed determination kinetic parameters obtained sigmoidal steady-state kinetics.
