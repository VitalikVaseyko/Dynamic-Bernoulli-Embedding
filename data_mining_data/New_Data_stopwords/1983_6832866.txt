 effect two sesquiterpene lactones germacranolide group, eupatoriopicrin hydroxyisonobilin, glycolytic metabolism human lymphocytes stimulated phytohemagglutinin tested. Glucose lactic acid levels well activities phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase measured. lactones caused decrease glucose consumption lactic acid formation well inhibition tested enzymes. stronger inhibitory effect observed case hydroxyisonobilin, particularly regard phosphofructokinase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
