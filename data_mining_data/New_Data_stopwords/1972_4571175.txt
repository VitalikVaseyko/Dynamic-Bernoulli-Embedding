 paper reports study kinetics reaction phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP Mg(2+) catalysed yeast pyruvate kinase activated fructose 1,6-diphosphate K(+). experimental results indicate reaction mechanism Ordered Tri Bi type substrates binding order phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP Mg(2+). Direct phosphoryl transfer takes place quaternary complex, pyruvate released MgATP. dead-end enzyme-pyruvate complex also indicated. Values determined Michaelis, dissociation inhibition constants reaction. Several rate constants involved also evaluated.
