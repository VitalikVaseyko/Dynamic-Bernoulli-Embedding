 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA mitochondria key regulatory enzyme oxidation glucose acetyl-CoA. Phosphorylation PDC pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK2 PDK4) inhibits PDC activity. Expression PDK genes elevated diabetes, leading decreased oxidation pyruvate acetyl-CoA. studies investigated transcriptional regulation PDK4 gene estrogen-related receptors (ERRalpha ERRgamma). ERRs orphan nuclear receptors whose physiological roles include induction fatty acid oxidation heart muscle. Previously, found peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1alpha) stimulates expression PDK4. report ERRalpha ERRgamma stimulate PDK4 gene hepatoma cells, suggesting novel role ERRs controlling pyruvate metabolism. addition, ERR isoforms recruit PGC-1alpha PDK4 promoter. Insulin, decreases expression PDK4 gene, inhibits induction PDK4 ERRalpha ERRgamma. forkhead transcription factor (FoxO1) binds PDK4 gene contributes induction PDK4 ERRs PGC-1alpha. Insulin suppresses PDK4 expression part dissociation FoxO1 PGC-1alpha PDK4 promoter. data demonstrate key role ERRs induction hepatic PDK4 gene expression.
