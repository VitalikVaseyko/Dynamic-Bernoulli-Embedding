 Decremental loss PTEN results cancer susceptibility tumor progression. PTEN elevation might therefore attractive option cancer prevention therapy. generated several transgenic mouse lines PTEN expression elevated varying levels taking advantage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mediated transgenesis. "Super-PTEN" mutants viable show reduced body size due decreased cell number, effect cell size. Unexpectedly, PTEN elevation organism level results healthy metabolism characterized increased energy expenditure reduced body fat accumulation. Cells derived mice show reduced glucose glutamine uptake increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation resistant oncogenic transformation. Mechanistically find PTEN elevation orchestrates metabolic switch regulating PI3K-dependent -independent pathways negatively impacting two pronounced metabolic features tumor cells: glutaminolysis Warburg effect.
