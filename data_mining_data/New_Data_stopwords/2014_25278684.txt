 Gastric cancer one deadliest cancers worldwide, especially prevalent Asian countries. high morbidity mortality, early diagnosis essential achieving curative intent treatment long term survival. Metabolomics new field study analyzes metabolites biofluids tissue samples. metabolomics still infancy, numerous potential applications oncology, specifically early diagnosis. studies literature examined metabolomics' role gastric cancer. Various fatty acid, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, amino acid metabolites identified distinguish gastric cancer normal tissue benign gastric disease. However, findings studies times conflicting. studies demonstrate relationship cancer cells Warburg Effect, glycolysis predominates conversion pyruvate lactate. one consistent findings across literature. less consistency metabolomic signature respect nucleic acids, lipids amino acids. spite this, metabolomics holds promise cancer surveillance studies necessary achieve consistency validation widely employed clinical tool.
