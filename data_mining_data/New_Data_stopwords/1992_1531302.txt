 effect estradiol-17 beta activities glycolytic enzymes female rat brain studied. following enzymes examined: hexokinase (HK, EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (PFK, EC 2.7.1.11), aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), phosphoglycerate mutase (EC 2.7.5.3), enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40). activities HK (soluble membrane-bound), PFK PK increased 4 h hormone treatment, others remained constant. changes activity seen presence actinomycin D. significant rise activities key glycolytic enzymes also observed cell culture mouse neuroblastoma C1300 treated hormone. three studied isozymes, namely, HKII, B4 K4 found estradiol-sensitive HK, PFK PK, respectively. results obtained suggest rat brain glycolysis regulation estradiol carried neurons due definite isozymes induction.
