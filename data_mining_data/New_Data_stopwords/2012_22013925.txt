 present study conducted test hypothesis dietary arginine promotes digestion absorption capacity, and, thus, enhances fish growth. improvement might related target rapamycin (TOR) eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP). total 1200 juvenile Jian carp, Cyprinus carpio var. Jian, average initial weight 6.33 (SE 0.03) g, fed diets containing graded concentrations arginine, namely, 9.8 (control), 12.7, 16.1, 18.5, 21.9 24.5 g arginine/kg diet 9 weeks. real-time quantitative PCR analysis performed determine relative expression TOR 4E-BP fish muscle, hepatopancreas intestine. Dietary arginine increased (P < 0.05): (1) glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities muscle hepatopancreas; (2) intestine hepatopancreas protein content, folds height, trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase creatine kinase activities intestine; (3) Lactobacillus counts; (4) relative expression TOR muscle, hepatopancreas distal intestine (DI); (5) relative expression 4E-BP proximal intestine (PI) mid-intestine (MI), compared control group. contrast, dietary arginine reduced (P < 0.05): (1) plasma ammonia content; (2) Aeromonas hydrophila Escherichia coli counts; (3) relative expression TOR PI MI; (4) relative expression 4E-BP muscle, hepatopancreas DI. arginine requirement estimated specific growth rate using quadratic regression analysis found 18.0 g/kg diet. results indicate arginine improved fish growth, digestive absorptive ability regulated expression TOR 4E-BP genes.
