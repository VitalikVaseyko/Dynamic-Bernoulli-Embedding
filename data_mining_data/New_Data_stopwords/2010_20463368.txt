 Solid tumors, including aggressive primary brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme, develop resistance cell death, part result switch mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation cytoplasmic glycolysis. metabolic remodeling accompanied mitochondrial hyperpolarization. tested whether small-molecule orphan drug dichloroacetate (DCA) reverse cancer-specific metabolic mitochondrial remodeling glioblastoma. Freshly isolated glioblastomas 49 patients showed mitochondrial hyperpolarization, rapidly reversed DCA. separate experiment five patients glioblastoma, prospectively secured baseline serial tumor tissue, developed patient-specific cell lines glioblastoma putative glioblastoma stem cells (CD133(+), nestin(+) cells), treated patient oral DCA 15 months. DCA depolarized mitochondria, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, induced apoptosis GBM cells, well putative GBM stem cells, vitro vivo. DCA therapy also inhibited hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, promoted p53 activation, suppressed angiogenesis vivo vitro. dose-limiting toxicity dose-dependent, reversible peripheral neuropathy, hematologic, hepatic, renal, cardiac toxicity. Indications clinical efficacy present dose cause peripheral neuropathy serum concentrations DCA sufficient inhibit target enzyme DCA, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase II, highly expressed glioblastomas. Metabolic modulation may viable therapeutic approach treatment glioblastoma.
