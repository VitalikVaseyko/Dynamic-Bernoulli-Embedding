 activity hepatic fructokinase increased 2-fold desert-derived spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus) laboratory bred albino mice rats, maintained 50% sucrose diet 3 months. role fructose specific inducer apparent, 25% fructose diet produced activity increases similar sucrose contrast 25% glucose diet. activity hexokinase affected sucrose diet, glucokinase rose marginally pyruvate kinase NADP-malate dehydrogenase rose pronouncedly, especially spiny mice. Fructokinase activity increased significantly 2 weeks diet continued rise gradually. activities gycolytic enzymes rose markedly already 3 days peaked 14 days. Fasting 48 hr influence fructokinase activity markedly reducing glucokinase, pyruvate kinase NADP-malate dehydrogenase. Streptozotocin diabetes rats resulted 40% reduction fructokinase activity 14 days restored 6 days insulin treatment. activity increases glycolytic enzymes marked. However, fructokinase induction sucrose diet evident also diabetic rats, suggesting insulin substrate effects independent. preference fructose glucose phosphorylation capacity clearly demonstrable non-diabetic diabetic rats became enhanced sucrose feeding. activity triokinase also increased sucrose diet 3 rodent species, suggesting coordinative substrate effect induction two rate-limiting fructolysis enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
