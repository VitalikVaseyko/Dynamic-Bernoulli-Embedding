 Ibogaine indole alkaloid present root plant Tabernanthe iboga. known attenuate abstinence syndrome animal models drug addiction. Since anti-addiction effect lasts longer presence ibogaine body, profound metabolic changes expected. aim study investigate effect ibogaine protein expression rat brains. Rats treated ibogaine 20 mg/kg body weight i.p. subsequently examined 24 72 h. Proteins extracted whole brain separated two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis. Individual proteins identified matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Enzymes glycolysis tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle namely glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase A, pyruvate kinase malate dehydrogenase induced. results suggest remedial effect ibogaine could mediated change energy availability. Since energy dissipating detoxification reversion tolerance different drugs abuse requires underlying functional structural changes cell, higher metabolic turnover would favourable. Understanding pharmacodynamics anti-addiction drugs highlights subcellular aspects addiction diseases, addition neurological psychological perspectives.
