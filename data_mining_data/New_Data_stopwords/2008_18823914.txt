 PANDAS cases Tourette syndrome (TS) proposed post-streptococcal movement disorders antibodies produced group beta-hemolytic streptococcus cross react brain epitopes. Attempts identify disease specific anti-striatal antibodies serum affected patients focused use Western immunoblotting ELISA methodologies. study, immunohistochemical techniques used identify serum anti-striatal antibody reactivity. positive samples, double staining anti-GFAP (glial) anti-MAP2 (neuronal) used establish localization immunofluorescence. significant differences immunofluorescence localization identified patients PANDAS (n=30) TS (n=30) compared controls (n=30). reactivity correlate tic severity elevated titers antistreptococcal antibodies. comparisons showed correlation autoreactivity determined immunofluorescence presence previously measured immunoblot reactivity human caudate putative antigens (pyruvate kinase M1 aldolase C). results confirm inability distinguish patient populations antibody measurements raise concerns presence autoimmune mechanism PANDAS TS.
