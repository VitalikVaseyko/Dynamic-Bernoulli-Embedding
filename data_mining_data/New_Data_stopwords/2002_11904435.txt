 Defects pancreatic beta-cell function contribute development type 2 diabetes, polygenic disease characterized insulin resistance compromised insulin secretion. Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) -1alpha, -3beta, -4alpha, Pdx-1 contribute complex transcriptional circuits within pancreas involved beta-cell development function. mice, heterozygous mutation Pdx-1 alone, Hnf-1alpha(+/-), Hnf-3beta(+/-), Hnf-4alpha(+/-), causes impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion mice. investigate possible functional relationships transcription factors beta-cell activity vivo, generated mice following combined heterozygous mutations: Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-1alpha(+/-), Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-3beta(+/-), Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-4alpha(+/-), Hnf-1alpha(+/-)/Hnf-4alpha(+/-), Hnf-3beta(+/-)/Hnf-4alpha(+/-). greatest loss function combined heterozygous null alleles Pdx-1 Hnf-1alpha (Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-1alpha(+/-)), Pdx-1 Hnf-3beta (Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-3beta(+/-)). double mutants develop progressively impaired glucose tolerance acquire compromised first- second-phase insulin secretion profile response glucose compared Pdx-1(+/-) mice alone. loss beta-cell function Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-3beta(+/-) mice associated decreased expression Nkx-6.1, glucokinase (Gck), aldolase B (aldo-B), insulin, whereas Nkx2.2, Nkx-6.1, Glut-2, Gck, aldo-B, liver isoform pyruvate kinase, insulin expression reduced Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-1alpha(+/-) mice. islet cell architecture also abnormal Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-3beta(+/-) Pdx-1(+/-)/Hnf-1alpha(+/-) mice, glucagon-expressing cells scattered throughout islet, defect may connected decreased E-cadherin expression. data suggest functional interactions key islet regulatory factors play important role maintaining islet architecture beta-cell function. studies also established polygenic mouse models investigating mechanisms contributing beta-cell dysfunction diabetes.
