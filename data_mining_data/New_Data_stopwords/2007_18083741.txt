 Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) made transgenic growth hormone (GH) non-transgenic salmon sampled 4 7 months age estimate myogenic factors, satellite cell proliferation metabolic enzyme activities. growth rate 4 month old transgenic salmon higher non-transgenic salmon. Myosatellite cell (MC) proliferation rates higher cells isolated GH-transgenic salmon compared cells non-transgenic salmon mass. Moreover, MCs extracted non-transgenic salmon demonstrated higher proliferation capacity exposed vitro salmon GH. White muscle MyoD mRNA content higher transgenic non-transgenic salmon 7 months compared 4 months, indicating effect age MyoD mRNA expression. White muscle myogenin mRNA content varied fish age presence transgene, higher transgenic fish 7 months, suggesting higher differentiation capacity. MyoD I, MyoD II myogenin mRNA content higher red muscle GH-transgenic fish 7 months compared non-transgenic salmon 7 months. However, red muscle myogenic factor expression different transgenic non-transgenic fish weight. Enzyme activities white muscle liver highly affected presence transgene, although effect generally dependent age fish. Glycolytic oxidative enzyme activities increased transgenic salmon liver, indicating higher metabolic rate transgenics. study demonstrates (1) higher growth rate transgenic salmon particularly 4 months age could explained least part higher numbers proliferation rates MCs, (2) GH directly stimulate proliferation myosatellite cells extracted salmon, indicating GH one possible factor involved higher myosatellite cell proliferation rates transgenic salmon, (3) MyoD myogenin mRNA expression affected fish age, (4) metabolic enzyme activities affected age fish least liver white muscle, transgene effect dependent upon age fish.
