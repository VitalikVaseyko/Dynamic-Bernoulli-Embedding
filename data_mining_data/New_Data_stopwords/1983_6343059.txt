 studied effect Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis (as measured conversion [U-14C]pyruvate glucose) hepatocytes isolated fed rats. influence VIP glycogen phosphorylase alpha pyruvate kinase activities, well cAMP levels, also evaluated. addition, possible antagonism insulin VIP-mediated effects investigated. VIP enhanced glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis dose-dependent manner. 10(-6) VIP, processes increased 2-fold compared basal values; calculated half-maximal stimulatory concentrations 2.5 x 10(-8) 4 x 10(-8) M, respectively. VIP also caused dose-dependent activation glycogen phosphorylase inactivation pyruvate kinase. 10(-6) VIP, glycogen phosphorylase increased 3-fold pyruvate kinase activity reduced 46%. addition 10(-7) VIP incubation medium caused 2-fold increase basal cAMP levels. VIP-mediated effects markedly blocked presence 10(-8) insulin. compared glucagon (10(-7) M) potency equimolar concentration VIP, terms stimulation gluconeogenesis, inactivation pyruvate kinase, activation glycogen phosphorylase ranged 35-45%. results indicate VIP increases hepatic glucose output stimulation glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis. effects seem mediated cAMP-dependent mechanism.
