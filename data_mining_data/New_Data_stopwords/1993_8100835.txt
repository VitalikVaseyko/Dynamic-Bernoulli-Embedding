 Oral administration vanadate diabetic streptozotocin-treated rats decreased high blood glucose D-3-hydroxybutyrate levels related diabetes. increase expression P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene, main regulatory enzyme gluconeogenesis, counteracted liver kidney vanadate administration diabetic rats. Vanadate also counteracted induction tyrosine aminotransferase gene expression due diabetes able increase expression glucokinase gene levels even higher found healthy animals. Similarly, induction pyruvate kinase mRNA transcripts observed diabetic vanadate-treated rats. effects correlated changes glucokinase pyruvate kinase activities. Vanadate treatment caused decrease expression liver-specific glucose transporter, GLUT-2. Thus, vanadate able restore liver glucose utilization block glucose production diabetic rats. increase expression mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCoAS) gene, key regulatory enzyme ketone bodies production pathway, observed diabetic rats also blocked vanadate. Furthermore, similar pattern expression PEPCK, GLUT-2, HMGCoAS, transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha genes observed. results suggest regulation expression genes involved glucose ketone bodies metabolism could key step normalization process induced vanadate administration diabetic rats.
