 1. Pyruvate kinase rumen ciliates genus Entodinium partially purified enzymatic properties investigated. 2. Three types pyruvate kinase (type I, II III) DEAE-cellulose column eluted linear gradient KCl. enzymatic properties differed among types enzyme, especially type type III displayed different kinetic properties other. enzymatic property type II enzyme intermediate type III. 3. principal enzyme, type I, required divalent cation, Mg2+ activated AMP FDP. ATP potent inhibitor. saturation curves substrates, PEP ADP, hyperbolic Km values 0.15 0.27 mM, respectively.
