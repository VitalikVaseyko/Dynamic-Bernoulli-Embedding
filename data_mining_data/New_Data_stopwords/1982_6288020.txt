 Hepatocytes isolated collagenase perfusion livers rats allowed access carbohydrate-rich diet laboratory chow deprived food 48h use. incubation l-[4,5-(3)H]leucine precipitation anti-(L-type pyruvate kinase) sera rates synthesis degradation L-type pyruvate kinase measured freshly prepared cells hepatocytes maintained monolayer culture 5 days. Hepatocytes carbohydrate-rich-diet-fed rats synthesized L-type pyruvate kinase cells chow-fed animals, turn synthesized cells 48h-starved rats. Hepatocytes maintained culture 5 days synthesized L-type pyruvate kinase similar rates freshly prepared cells. degradation [(3)H]leucine-labelled L-type pyruvate kinase shown biphasic. phase t((1/2)) (half-time) 4.9h duration 8-10h followed phase t((1/2)) 79.2h. Cells chow-fed carbohydrate-rich-diet-fed rats showed similar patterns degradation L-type pyruvate kinase. addition 2mm-fructose 0.1mum-insulin culture medium increased t((1/2)) rapid phase 12h cells isolated carbohydrate-rich-diet-fed rats, cells chow-fed rats. secondary, slower, phase degradation remained unaffected. degradation fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase total cell protein followed first-order kinetics. half-life fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 41.0h cells chow-fed animals 48.5h cells carbohydrate-rich-diet-fed donors. Fructose insulin affect rate enzyme degradation. propose role protein catabolism short-term long-term control L-type pyruvate kinase concentration.
