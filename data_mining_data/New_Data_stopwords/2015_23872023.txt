 addition well-known effects vitamin (VitD) maintaining bone health, increasing appreciation vitamin may serve important roles organs tissues, including brain. Given VitD deficiency especially widespread among elderly, important understand range serum VitD levels mimic found humans (from low high) affects brain aging middle age old age. address issue, 27 male F344 rats split three groups fed isocaloric diets containing low (100 IU/kg food), control (1000 IU/kg food), high (10,000 IU/kg food) VitD beginning middle age (12 months) continued period 4-5 months. compared effects dietary VitD manipulations oxidative nitrosative stress measures posterior brain cortices. low-VitD group showed global elevation 3-nitrotyrosine compared control high-VitD-treated groups. investigation showed elevation may involve dysregulation nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer activated B cells (NF-kappaB) pathway NF-kappaB-mediated transcription inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) indicated translocation NF-kappaB nucleus elevation iNOS levels. Proteomics techniques used provide insight potential mechanisms underlying effects. Several brain proteins found significantly elevated levels low-VitD group compared control high-VitD groups. Three proteins, 6-phosphofructokinase, triose phosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase, involved directly glycolysis. Two others, peroxiredoxin-3 DJ-1/PARK7, peroxidase activity found mitochondria. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (cyclophilin A) shown multiple roles, including protein folding, regulation protein kinases phosphatases, immunoregulation, cell signaling, redox status. Together, results suggest dietary VitD deficiency contributes significant nitrosative stress brain may promote cognitive decline middle-aged elderly adults.
