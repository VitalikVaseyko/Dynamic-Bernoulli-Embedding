 AIM: Differences fibre-type recruitment exercise may induce heterogenic response fibre-type gene expression. investigated effect two different exercise protocols fibre-type-specific expression master genes involved oxidative metabolism [proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)]. METHODS: Untrained subjects (n = 7) completed 90-min cycling either constant intensity [continuous exercise (CE): approximately 60% VO(2max) ] interval exercise (IE: approximately 120/20% VO(2max) , duty cycle 12/18s). Muscle samples taken (pre) 3 h (post) exercise. Single fibres isolated freeze-dried muscle characterized type type II. cDNA two fibres type pooled mRNA analysed reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Continuous exercise IE elicited small increase blood lactate (<2.5 mM) moderate glycogen depletion (<40%) without difference exercise modes. mRNA PGC-1alpha PDK4 increased 5- 8-fold fibre types exercise, relative increase negatively correlated basal level. However, mRNA PGC-1alpha PDK4 different type II fibres neither pre post, difference exercise-induced response fibre types exercise modes. CONCLUSION: conclude mRNA PGC-1alpha PDK4 increases markedly fibre types prolonged exercise without difference CE IE. similar response fibre types may relate subjects sedentary metabolic stress low.
