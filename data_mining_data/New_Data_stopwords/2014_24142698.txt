 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) key player Warburg effect cancer cells. However, mechanisms regulating PKM2 fully elucidated. Here, identified protein-serine/threonine kinase PIM2, known oncogene, novel binding partner PKM2. interaction PIM2 PKM2 confirmed multiple biochemical approaches vitro cultured cells. Importantly, found PIM2 could directly phosphorylate PKM2 Thr-454 residue, resulting increase PKM2 protein levels. Compared wild type, PKM2 phosphorylation-defective mutation displayed reduced effect glycolysis, co-activating HIF-1alpha beta-catenin, cell proliferation, enhancing mitochondrial respiration cancer cells. findings demonstrate PIM2-dependent phosphorylation PKM2 critical regulating Warburg effect cancer, highlighting PIM2 potential therapeutic target.
