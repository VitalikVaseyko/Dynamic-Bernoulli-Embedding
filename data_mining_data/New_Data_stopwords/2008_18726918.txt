 Evaluation two patients transfusion dependent anemia revealed RBC pyruvate kinase 33% 41% mean normal value, normal high values RBC enzymes. Parental PK activities normal three four parents. Subsequent DNA analysis revealed patients compound heterozygotes PKLR gene mutations, two previously undescribed. Borderline low pyruvate kinase activities increased RBC enzyme activities prompt consideration measurement parental enzyme activities, confirmation DNA analysis available.
