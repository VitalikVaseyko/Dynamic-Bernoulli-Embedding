 Macrophage activation key event inflammatory process, since cells produce range pro-inflammatory molecules, including ROS (reactive oxygen species), prostaglandins, cytokines nitric oxide. factors promote inflammation causing vasodilation recruitment neutrophils, monocytes lymphocytes, ultimately clear infection repair damaged tissue. One potent macrophage activators Gram-negative-derived bacterial cell wall component LPS (lipopolysaccharide). LPS sensed TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) triggers highly complex signalling pathways culminate activation transcription factors NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB), turn increases transcription genes encoding proteins COX2 (cyclo-oxygenase 2, key enzyme prostaglandin biosynthesis), nitric oxide synthase cytokines TNF (tumour necrosis factor). Recently, role metabolic pathways regulation LPS signalling become focus research inflammation. notable example LPS promoting so-called Warburg effect - aerobic glycolysis. allows up-regulation ATP production, also production biosynthetic intermediates meet demands activated macrophages. issue Biochemical Journal, Infantino et al. add new finding role metabolism LPS action. demonstrate requirement mitochondrial citrate carrier induction ROS, nitric oxide prostaglandins LPS. knockdown carrier siRNA (small interfering RNA), use inhibitor BTA (benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylate), abolishes responses. Although mechanism provided, authors speculate acetyl-CoA synthesized citrate cytosol. acetyl-CoA generated could required phospholipid biosynthesis, phospholipids source arachidonic acid prostaglandin production. Another product citrate metabolism, oxaloacetate, indirectly generate nitric oxide ROS. finding places citrate, transported mitochondria, key player LPS signalling, least ROS, nitric oxide prostaglandin production. somewhat unexpected role citrate LPS action adds growing literature role metabolism regulation signalling inflammation.
