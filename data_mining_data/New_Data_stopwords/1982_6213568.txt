 effect thyroidectomy (Tx) key enzymes involved glycolysis HMP-shunt pathway studied testis pre-pubertal, pubertal adult rats. Hexokinase (HK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) show significant change activity Tx. However, pyruvate kinase (PK) activity reduced Tx testis pre-pubertal animals although pubertal adult rats affected. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PG-DH) activities reduced Tx thyroxine (T4) replacement brought enzyme activities back towards normal. possible effect thyroid testicular steroidogenesis acting HMP-shunt discussed.
