 Recent experiments indicate uniformly compressing cancer mass surface tends transform many cells proliferative functional forms. Cancer cells suffer Warburg effect, resulting depleted levels cell membrane potentials. show compression results added free energy added energy contributes distortional pressure cells. excites piezoelectric effect cell membranes, particular raising potentials membranes cancer cells depleted levels near-normal levels. sample calculation, gain 150 mV attained. allows Warburg effect reversed. result least partially regained function accompanying increased molecular order. transformation remains even pressure turned off, suggesting change phase; possibilities briefly discussed. found pressure is, particular, applied adiabatically process obeys second law thermodynamics, validating theoretical model.
