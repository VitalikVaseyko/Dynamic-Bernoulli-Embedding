 contrast Mg2+-activated enzyme, presence Mn2+ pyruvate kinase exhibits hyperbolic kinetics respect substrate phosphoenolpyruvate insensitive fructose 1,6-biphosphate, phenylalanine alanine. However, metal activated species inhibition excess ADP observed. contrast Mg2+, affords significant protection inactivation caused 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid), rate inactivation reagent increased presence Mn2+. Differences conformational changes induced combination pyruvate kinase Mg2+ Mn2+ indicated u.v. difference spectra.
