 mean activities (95% confidence interval; number patients) erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK) haemolysate clinically normal neonates Basrah, Iraq found 3.29 (0.10; n = 456), 0.61 (0.02; n = 219), 5.10 (0.07; n = 500), respectively, expressed U/10(10) RBC 37 degrees C. Comparative values apparently healthy adults were: 2.14 (0.06; n = 186), 0.41 (0.02; n = 46), 3.61 (0.07; n = 243). Differences sexes mean activities three enzymes significant (p > 0.5), several times less corresponding 95% confidence intervals. However, differences highly significant neonates adults (p < 0.001), presumably reflecting greater proportion 'young' cells and/or programming higher activity cord blood. neonate-adult difference (95% confidence interval) enzyme was: G6PD, 1.15 (0.43); HK, 0.20 (0.14); PK, 1.49 (0.64). degree G6PD-deficiency observed 7.9% male 9.7% female neonates, whereas frequency adults 9.2% 11.8% males females, respectively. higher frequency females accords expectations based gene frequency estimations.
