 effects novel hypoglycemic agent, calcium(2s)-2-benzyl-3-(cis-hexahydro-2-isoindolinylcarbonyl) propionate dihydrate (KAD-1229), benzyl succinate derivative, liver metabolism investigated using isolated hepatocytes normal rats. presence 10 mM glucose, KAD-1229 increased L-lactate production (41.1 +/- 0.9 versus 60.9 +/- 2.6 mumol lactate/g cells/30 min; P < 0.05) inhibited gluconeogenesis hepatocytes (0.94 +/- 0.02 versus 0.70 +/- 0.03 mumol [2-14C]-pyruvate converted glucose/g cells/20 min; P < 0.05). effects KAD-1229 accompanied increase cellular content fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2), one important regulators hepatic glucose metabolism, dose-dependent manner (0.05-2.5 mM). KAD-1229 also stimulated oxidation [2-14C]-pyruvate [6-14C]-glucose tricarboxylic acid cycle (+18 +31%, respectively), indicating stimulation tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and/or enhancement glycolytic flux rate occurred. Moreover, KAD-1229 modify activities 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, increased significantly accumulation fructose 6-phosphate hepatocytes. results suggest KAD-1229 extrapancreatic effects hepatic glucose metabolism, actions mediated inhibition fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase stimulation 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase reaction tricarboxylic acid cycle activity increasing F-2,6-P2 content hepatocytes, multiple effects may account part ability KAD-1229 reduce blood glucose levels vivo.
