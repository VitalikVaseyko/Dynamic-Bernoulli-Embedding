 Piriformospora indica endophytic fungus colonizes roots many plant species promotes growth resistance certain plant pathogens. Despite potential use agriculture, little known molecular basis beneficial plant-fungal interaction. genetic screen plants, show P. indica- induced growth response, isolated Arabidopsis mutant OXI1 (Oxidative Signal Inducible1) gene. OXI1 characterized protein kinase plays role pathogen response regulated H(2)O(2) PDK1 (3-PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE1). genetic analysis showed double mutants two closely related PDK1.1 PDK1.2 genes defective growth response P. indica. OXI1 PDK1 gene expression upregulated P. indica-colonized roots, defense genes downregulated, indicating fungus suppresses plant defense reactions. PDK1 activated phosphatidic acid (PA) P. indica triggers PA synthesis Arabidopsis plants. beneficial co-cultivation conditions, H(2)O(2) formation even reduced fungus. Importantly, phospholipase (PLD)alpha1 PLDdelta mutants, impaired PA synthesis show growth promotion response fungal infection. data establish P. indica-stimulated growth response mediated pathway consisting PLD-PDK1-OXI1 cascade.
