 OBJECTIVES: Endoscopy remains gold standard diagnose evaluate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity. Current biomarkers combinations cannot adequately predict IBD risk, diagnosis, progression relapse, response therapy. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) emerging significant mediator inflammatory process. aimed assess levels serum PKM2 healthy newly diagnosed IBD patients relationship IBD indices microbiota changes. DESIGN METHODS: IBD serum samples newly diagnosed patients collected analyzed using PKM2-ELISA correlated disease activity scores, IBD disease type, intestinal microbiota. Furthermore, tested genetic protein expression PKM2 vitro intestinal cell model inflammation. RESULTS: Serum PKM2 levels 6-fold higher IBD patients compared healthy controls, sensitivity disease phenotype (Crohn's Disease Ulcerative Colitis) localization inflammation. Serum PKM2 considerably less interindividual variability established IBD fecal biomarkers. positive Pearson correlation (r=0.6121) existed serum PKM2 Bacteroidetes fecal levels Crohn's disease (CD), negative (r=-0.6128) correlation observed Actinobacteria fecal levels. Furthermore, LPS (500ng/mL) significantly increased PKM2 expression vitro, significantly suppressed anti-inflammatory flaxseed bioactive agent. CONCLUSION: data suggests PKM2 putative biomarker IBD dysbiosis microflora CD. Investigations involving larger number clinical patients necessary validate use serum biomarker IBD.
