 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) generally referred transitional zone normal cognitive function early dementia clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oxidative stress plays significant role AD increased superior/middle temporal gyri MCI subjects. AD involves hippocampal-resident memory dysfunction, determined protein oxidation identified oxidized proteins hippocampi MCI subjects. found protein oxidation significantly increased hippocampi MCI subjects compared age- sex-matched controls. using redox proteomics, determined oxidatively modified proteins MCI hippocampus alpha-enolase (ENO1), glutamine synthetase (GLUL), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase 1 (PIN1). interacteome proteins revealed proteins functionally interact SRC, hypoxia-inducible factor 1, plasminogen (PLG), MYC, tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT) BCL2L1. Moreover, interacteome indicates functional involvement energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity mitogenesis/proliferation. Therefore, oxidative inactivation ENO1, GLUL PIN1 may alter cellular processes lead development AD MCI. conclude protein oxidation plays significant role development AD MCI oxidative inactivation ENO1, GLUL, PKM2 PIN1 involved progression AD MCI. current study provides framework future studies development AD MCI relevant oxidative stress.
