 lipoamide dehydrogenase (LPD) encoded lpdA gene component pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (AKGDH) glycine cleavage multi-enzyme (GCV) systems. present study, cell growth characteristics, enzyme activities intracellular metabolite concentrations compared parent strain Escherichia coli BW25113 lpdA knockout mutant batch continuous cultures. lpdA knockout mutant produced significantly pyruvate L-glutamate aerobiosis. D-lactate succinate also accumulated culture broth. Based investigation enzyme activities intracellular metabolite concentrations, acetyl-CoA considered formed combined reactions pyruvate oxidase (PoxB), acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs) acetate kinase (Ack)-phosphoacetyltransferase (Pta) lpdA mutant. effect lpdA gene knockout intracellular metabolic flux distributions investigated based 1H-13C NMR spectra GC-MS signals obtained 13C-labeling experiment using mixture [U-13C] glucose, [1-13C] glucose, naturally labeled glucose. Flux analysis lpdA mutant indicated Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway glyoxylate shunt activated. fluxes glycolysis oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway (except flux glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) slightly downregulated. TCA cycle also downregulated mutant strain. hand, fluxes anaplerotic reactions PEP carboxylase, PEP carboxykinase malic enzyme upregulated, consistent results enzyme activities. Furthermore, influence poxB gene knockout growth E. coli also studied similar function PDHc connects glycolysis TCA cycle. aerobiosis, comparison lpdA mutant poxB mutant indicated PDHc main enzyme catalyzes reaction pyruvate acetyl-CoA parent strain, PoxB plays important role PDHc-deficient strain.
