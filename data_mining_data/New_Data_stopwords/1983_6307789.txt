 diabetic rats transplanted fetal pancreata measured activities six important enzymes assess return liver metabolism normal. Comparison made among responses transplanted rats without renal-portal vein shunts transplanted injected insulin varying doses. Insulin supply limited since three four fetal pancreata first grown normal rats transfer diabetic animals. Transplantation normalized blood urine glucose rate disappearance intravenous glucose. Glucokinase pyruvate kinase activities liver rose toward normal 7 days transplantation reached normal levels 30 90 days. response four enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, citric lyase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, rapidly restored normal 7 days remained normal 30 90 days. difference observed enzyme activities transplanted-shunted rats nonshunted animals. Glucokinase activity restored normal 1 wk daily injections 1 U PZI; pyruvate kinase restoration required 3 U/day. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase citric lyase required 2 U/day restored normal; 3 U daily resulted temporary supernormal activities. gluconeogenic enzymes, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase glucose-6-phosphatase, partially suppressed toward normal insulin even 3 U daily 3 wk. findings indicate pancreas transplantation effective regulator liver metabolism diabetes insulin injections.
