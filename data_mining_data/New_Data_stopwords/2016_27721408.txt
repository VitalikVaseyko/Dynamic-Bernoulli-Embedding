 Multiple drug resistance challenging issue clinic. growing evidence G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) novel mediator development multidrug resistance estrogen receptor (ER)-positive -negative breast cancers, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) tumor microenvironment may new agent promotes drug resistance tumor cells. However, role cytoplasmic GPER CAFs tumor therapy remains unclear. first show breast tumor cell-activated PI3K/AKT (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT) signaling pathway induces cytoplasmic GPER translocation CAFs CRM1-dependent pattern, leads activation novel estrogen/GPER/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling axis triggers aerobic glycolysis switch CAFs. glycolytic CAFs feed extra pyruvate lactate tumor cells augmentation mitochondrial activity, energy metabolically coupled 'host-parasite relationship' catabolic CAFs anabolic cancer cells confers tumor cells multiple drug resistance several conventional clinical treatments including endocrine therapy (tamoxifen), Her-2-targeted therapy (herceptin) chemotherapy (epirubicin). Moreover, clinical data (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography present strong association GPER/cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway stromal fibroblasts tumor metabolic activity clinical treatment, suggesting targeting cytoplasmic GPER CAFs may rescue drug sensitivity patients breast cancer. Thus, data define novel insights stromal GPER-mediated multiple drug resistance point reprogramming tumor energy metabolism provide rationale CAFs promising target clinical therapy.
