 purpose study determine whether pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4 expressed adipocytes whether PDK4 expression hormonally regulated fat cells. Northern blot Western blot analyses conducted samples isolated 3T3-L1 adipocytes various treatments prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), and/or insulin. Transfection PDK4 promoter reporter constructs performed. addition, glucose uptake measurements conducted. studies demonstrate PRL porcine GH induce expression PDK4 3T3-L1 adipocytes. studies also show insulin pretreatment attenuate ability hormones induce PDK4 mRNA expression. addition, identified hormone-responsive region murine PDK4 promoter characterized STAT5 binding site region mediates PRL (sheep) GH (porcine) induction PDK4 expression 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PDK4 STAT5A target gene. PRL potent inducer PDK4 protein levels, results inhibition insulin-stimulated glucose transport fat cells, likely contributes PRL-induced insulin resistance.
