 bioelectrochemical systems, electrode potential important parameter affecting electron flow electrodes microbes microbial metabolic activities. Here, investigated metabolic characteristics glucose-utilizing strain engineered Shewanella oneidensis electrode-respiring conditions electrochemical reactors gaining insight metabolic pathways electrochemically active bacteria affected electrode potential. electrochemical reactor operated working electrode poised +0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode), engineered S. oneidensis strain, carrying plasmid encoding sugar permease glucose kinase Escherichia coli, generated current oxidizing glucose acetate produced D-lactate intermediate metabolite. However, D-lactate accumulation observed engineered strain grown working electrode poised 0 V. also found transcription genes involved pyruvate D-lactate metabolisms upregulated high electrode potential compared transcription low electrode potential. results suggest carbon catabolic pathway S. oneidensis modified controlling potential working electrode electrochemical bioreactor.
