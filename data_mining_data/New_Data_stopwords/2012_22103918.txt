 Phosphorylation mitochondrial proteins recognized decades, regulation pyruvate- branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenases atypical kinase/phosphatase cascade well established. recently, development new mass spectrometry-based technologies led discovery many novel phosphorylation sites variety mitochondrial targets. evidence suggests major classes kinase several phosphatases may present mitochondrial outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, matrix, many questions remain answered location, timing, reversibility phosphorylation events whether functionally relevant. authors review phosphorylation mitochondrial regulatory strategy highlight possible role pathophysiology cardiac hypertrophy failure.
