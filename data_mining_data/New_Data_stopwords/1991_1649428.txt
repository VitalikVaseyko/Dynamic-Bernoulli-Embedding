 activities glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) pyruvate carboxylase (PC) determined homogenates adult Schistosoma mansoni worms compared activities homogenates rat liver rat skeletal muscle, tissues high low gluconeogenic capacity, respectively. four gluconeogenic enzymes present S. mansoni. enzymes less active rat liver, activities G6Pase, PEPCK PC least order magnitude higher rat skeletal muscle whereas FBPase approximately equally active S. mansoni rat muscle. Experiments 14C-labelled substrates [14C]NaHCO3 failed demonstrate actual occurrence gluconeogenesis S. mansoni. possible functions gluconeogenic enzymes investigated. Experiments inhibitors PEPCK gave indications enzyme involved degradation glucose. confirmed 13C-NMR experiments indicated lactate formed phosphoenolpyruvate via actions pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, PEPCK participate formation lactate. Substrate cycling fructose-6-dehydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate demonstrated occur adult S. mansoni. shows FBPase participates glucose metabolism parasite.
