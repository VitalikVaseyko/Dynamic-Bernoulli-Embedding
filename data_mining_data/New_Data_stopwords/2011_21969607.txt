 Warburg effect describes increase aerobic glycolysis enhanced lactate production cancer cells. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) regulates last step glycolysis generates lactate permits regeneration NAD(+). LDH-A gene expression believed upregulated HIF Myc cancer cells achieve increased lactate production. However, oncogenic signals activate LDH-A regulate cancer cell metabolism remains unclear. found oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR1 directly phosphorylates LDH-A. Phosphorylation Y10 Y83 enhances LDH-A activity enhancing formation active, tetrameric LDH-A binding LDH-A substrate NADH, respectively. Moreover, Y10 phosphorylation LDH-A common diverse human cancer cells, correlates activation multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, cancer cells stable knockdown endogenous LDH-A rescue expression catalytic hypomorph LDH-A mutant, Y10F, demonstrate increased respiration mitochondrial complex sustain glycolysis providing NAD(+). However, compensatory increase mitochondrial respiration Y10F cells insufficient fully sustain glycolysis. Y10 rescue cells show decreased cell proliferation ATP levels hypoxia reduced tumor growth xenograft nude mice. findings suggest tyrosine phosphorylation enhances LDH-A enzyme activity promote Warburg effect tumor growth regulating NADH/NAD(+) redox homeostasis, representing acute molecular mechanism underlying enhanced lactate production cancer cells.
