 Reversible protein phosphorylation prevalent signaling mechanism modulates cellular metabolism response changing environmental conditions. study, focus previously uncharacterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK) PknJ, putative transmembrane protein. PknJ shown possess autophosphorylation activity also found capable carrying phosphorylation artificial substrate myelin basic protein (MyBP). Previous studies shown autophosphorylation activity M. tuberculosis STPKs dependent conserved residues activation loop. However, results show apart conventional conserved residues, additional residues activation loop may also play crucial role kinase activation. characterization PknJ reveals kinase utilizes unusual ions (Ni(2+), Co(2+)) cofactors, thus hinting novel mechanism PknJ activation. Additionally, shown STPKs, observe PknJ possesses capability dimerize. order elucidate signal transduction cascade emanating PknJ, M. tuberculosis membrane-associated protein fraction treated active kinase glycolytic enzyme Pyruvate kinase (mtPykA) identified one potential substrates PknJ. phospholabel found localized serine threonine residue(s), Ser(37) identified one sites phosphorylation. Since Pyk known catalyze last step glycolysis, study shows fundamental pathways glycolysis also governed STPK-mediated signaling.
