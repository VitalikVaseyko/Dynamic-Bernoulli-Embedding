 Ceramide sphingolipid metabolite induces cancer cell death. C6-ceramide encapsulated nanoliposome bilayer formulation, cell death selectively induced tumor models. However, mechanism underlying selectivity unknown. tumors exhibit preferential switch glycolysis, described "Warburg effect", hypothesize ceramide nanoliposomes selectively target glycolytic pathway cancer. utilize chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cancer model, increased dependency glycolysis. CLL cells, demonstrate C6-ceramide nanoliposomes, control nanoliposomes, induce caspase 3/7-independent necrotic cell death. Nanoliposomal ceramide inhibits RNA protein expression GAPDH, enzyme glycolytic pathway, overexpressed CLL. confirm ceramide targets GAPDH, demonstrate downregulation GAPDH potentiates decrease ATP ceramide treatment exogenous pyruvate treatment well GAPDH overexpression partially rescues ceramide-induced necrosis. Finally, vivo murine model CLL shows nanoliposomal C6-ceramide treatment elicits tumor regression, concomitant GAPDH downregulation. conclude selective inhibition glycolytic pathway CLL cells nanoliposomal C6-ceramide could potentially effective therapy leukemia targeting Warburg effect.
