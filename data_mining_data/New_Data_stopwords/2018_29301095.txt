 Indirubin indole alkaloid used treat various diseases including granulocytic leukemia, cancer, Alzheimer's disease. Microbial production indirubin far achieved supplementation rather expensive substrates indole tryptophan. Here, report development metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain capable producing indirubin directly glucose. First, Methylophaga aminisulfidivorans flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) E. coli tryptophanase (TnaA) introduced E. coli order complete biosynthetic pathway tryptophan indirubin. engineering performed rational strategies including disruption regulatory repressor gene trpR removal feedback inhibitions AroG TrpE. Then, combinatorial approach employed systematically screening eight genes involved common aromatic amino acid pathway. Moreover, availability aromatic precursor substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate erythrose-4-phosphate, enhanced inactivating pykF (pyruvate kinase I) pykA (pyruvate kinase II) genes, overexpressing tktA gene (encoding transketolase), respectively. Fed-batch fermentation final engineered strain led production 0.056g/L indirubin directly glucose. metabolic engineering synthetic biology strategies reported thus allows microbial fermentative production indirubin glucose.
