 Selected enzymes energy metabolism measured random individual fibers soleus tibialis anterior (TA) muscles rats exposed 2 wk spaceflight (F) aboard COSMOS 2044 tail suspension (T) synchronous controls. Average size soleus fibers (dry weight per unit length) reduced 37% F fibers; little change TA fibers. Enzyme changes pronounced soleus TA fibers. Three enzymes characteristic fast-twitch muscles, pyruvate kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1-phosphofructokinase, elevated F soleus fibers, changes phosphofructokinase statistically significant. 3-Ketoacid-CoA transferase, characteristic slow-twitch muscles, change significantly either F fibers. Hexokinase, usually moderately higher slow- fast-twitch muscles, increased markedly F fibers. TA fibers analyzed hexokinase, malate dehydrogenase, phosphohexoisomerase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase malate dehydrogenase showed significant changes. Hexokinase increased 83% one two muscles. Enzyme data TA fibers typed myosin adenosinetriphosphatase informative: phosphofructokinase, phosphorylase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase increased type IIb fibers either F muscles both. Malate dehydrogenase changed fibers type either F muscle.
