 Pre-clinical clinical studies investigated role dysregulated metabolism sustainability tumor initiation progression. One familiar metabolic alterations encountered several types cancers upregulation glycolysis, also maintained conditions normal oxygen tension (aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect) oxidative phosphorylation apparently reduced. result, cancer cells convert incoming glucose lactate. Although rapid, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production glycolysis less efficient terms ATP generated per unit glucose consumed oxidative phosphorylation. consequence tumor cells require abnormally higher rate glucose compared normal counterpart. New evidence shows metabolic substrates glutamine may also important role cancer metabolism. Ketogenic diet (KD) replaces non-starchy vegetable carbohydrates low moderate amounts proteins high amounts monounsaturated polyunsaturated fats. rationale KD valid lowers carbohydrate uptake possibly leading cancer cell starvation apoptosis and, time, increases levels ketone bodies available energy production normal cells cancer cells allegedly downregulated oxidative phosphorylation. reason, several authors speculate possibility evaluate KD novel approach treatment cancer. review assess data supporting use alimentary regimen impact tumor development progression.
