 BACKGROUND: Protein phosphorylation considered key event signal transduction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) critical component immune system. analysis PBMCs phosphoproteome might help elucidate signaling pathways essential biological role health, immunological diseases cancer. Enrichment phosphoproteins becomes prerequisite phosphoproteome analysis conventionally requires multi-step procedure sophisticated equipments. study, standardized 2D-PAGE phosphoproteome analysis PBMCs compared two phosphoprotein enrichment methods, lanthanum chloride precipitation affinity micro-column. Further, different specificity PBMCs phosphorylated proteins method investigated. RESULTS: PBMCs isolated fresh whole blood ten healthy donors. PBMCs phosphoproteins enriched either phosphoprotein precipitation using lanthanum chloride, overall yield 8.9 +/- 4.7%, using affinity micro-column, lower yield 3.2 +/- 1.6% (p = 0.05). Image analysis Sypro-stained analytical 2D-PAGE gels detected 554 +/- 68 protein spots lanthanum pattern [inter-assay coefficient variation (CV) = 27.0%, intra-assay CV = 10.7%] 575 +/- 35 protein spots micro-column pattern (inter-assay CV = 26.8%; intra-assay CV = 11.0%) (p = 0.6), 57% match spots detected 2 approaches. 1D gel electrophoresis western blot analyses supernatants suggested better lanthanum ions capability deplete phosphoproteins PBMCs protein lysate compared affinity micro-column. hand, 1D gel electrophoresis analysis dephosphorylated PBMCs protein lysate revealed relatively higher unspecificity lanthanum ions compared affinity micro-column. Filamin-A, coronin 1A, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 ficolin-1 considerably expressed lanthanum phosphoprotein pattern. Interestingly, ficolin-1 reported 2DE-PBMCs proteome profiles far. CONCLUSION: results describe differences validity phosphoprotein enrichment methods provide two successful complementary approaches 2DE phosphoproteome analysis PBMCs.
