 previously demonstrated enhanced aerobic glycolysis and/or autophagy tumor stroma supports epithelial cancer cell growth aggressive behavior, via secretion high-energy metabolites. nutrients include lactate ketones, well chemical building blocks, amino acids (glutamine) nucleotides. Lactate ketones serve fuel cancer cell oxidative metabolism, building blocks sustain anabolic needs rapidly proliferating cancer cells. termed novel concepts "Reverse Warburg Effect," "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model Cancer Metabolism." also identified loss stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) marker stromal glycolysis autophagy. aim current study provide genetic evidence enhanced glycolysis stromal cells favors tumorigenesis. end, normal human fibroblasts genetically-engineered express two isoforms pyruvate kinase (PKM1 PKM2), key enzyme glycolytic pathway. xenograft model, fibroblasts expressing PKM1 PKM2 greatly promoted growth co-injected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, without increase tumor angiogenesis. Interestingly, PKM1 PKM2 promoted tumorigenesis different mechanism(s). Expression PKM1 enhanced glycolytic power stromal cells, increased output lactate. Analysis tumor xenografts demonstrated PKM1 fibroblasts greatly induced tumor inflammation, judged CD45 staining. contrast, PKM2 lead lactate accumulation, triggered "pseudo-starvation" response stromal cells, induction NFkappaB-dependent autophagic program, increased output ketone body 3-hydroxy-buryrate. Strikingly, situ evaluation Complex IV activity tumor xenografts demonstrated stromal PKM2 expression drives mitochondrial respiration specifically tumor cells. Finally, immuno-histochemistry analysis human breast cancer samples lacking stromal Cav-1 revealed PKM1 PKM2 expression tumor stroma. Thus, data indicate subset human breast cancer patients loss stromal Cav-1 show profound metabolic changes tumor microenvironment. such, subgroup patients may benefit therapeutically potent inhibitors targeting glycolysis, autophagy and/or mitochondrial activity (such metformin).
