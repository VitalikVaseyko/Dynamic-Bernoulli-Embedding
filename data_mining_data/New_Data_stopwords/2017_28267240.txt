 Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) expressed different types invasive proliferative cells, including cancer cells stromal cells. MT1-MMP cleaves extracellular matrix proteins, membrane proteins pericellular proteins, thereby changing cellular microenvironment regulating signal activation. Critical roles protease activity cancer cell proliferation, invasion metastasis demonstrated many groups. MT1-MMP also non-protease activity inhibits oxygen-dependent suppression hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) via Munc18-1-interacting protein 3 (Mint3) thereby enhances expression HIF target genes. Elevated HIF activity MT1-MMP-expressing cancer cells fundamental mechanism underlying Warburg effect, well-known phenomenon malignant cancer cells exhibit higher rate glucose metabolism. specific intervention HIF activation MT1-MMP suppresses tumor formation cancer cells mice, proteolytic non-proteolytic activities MT1-MMP important tumor malignancy function integrated manner. review, summarize recent findings relating MT1-MMP activates HIF effects cancer cells stromal cells.
