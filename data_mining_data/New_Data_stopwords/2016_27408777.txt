 OBJECTIVE: Recent data suggest adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) plays key role providing energy substrate triglyceride pools alterations expression/activity relate metabolic disturbances skeletal muscle. Yet little known regulation. investigated role protein G0/G1 Switch Gene 2 (G0S2), recently described inhibitor ATGL white adipose tissue, regulation lipolysis oxidative metabolism skeletal muscle. METHODS: first examined G0S2 protein expression relation metabolic status muscle characteristics humans. next overexpressed knocked G0S2 human primary myotubes assess impact ATGL activity, lipid turnover oxidative metabolism, knocked G0S2 vivo mouse skeletal muscle. RESULTS: G0S2 protein increased skeletal muscle endurance-trained individuals correlates markers oxidative capacity lipid content. Recombinant G0S2 protein inhibits ATGL activity 40% lysates mouse human skeletal muscle. G0S2 overexpression augments (+49%, p < 0.05) G0S2 knockdown strongly reduces (-68%, p < 0.001) triglyceride content human primary myotubes mouse skeletal muscle. show G0S2 controls lipolysis fatty acid oxidation strictly ATGL-dependent manner. metabolic adaptations mediated G0S2 paralleled concomitant changes glucose metabolism modulation Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 4 (PDK4) expression (5.4 fold, p < 0.001). Importantly, downregulation G0S2 vivo mouse skeletal muscle recapitulates changes lipid metabolism observed vitro. CONCLUSION: Collectively, data indicate G0S2 plays key role regulation skeletal muscle ATGL activity, lipid content oxidative metabolism.
