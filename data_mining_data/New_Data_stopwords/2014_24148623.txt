 Glioblastoma multiforme aggressive primary brain tumor adults. Overexpression EGF receptor (EGFR) recognized widespread oncogenic signature glioblastoma multiforme, complexity contributions fully understood, effective ways leverage anti-EGFR therapy setting. Hypoxia known drive aggressive character glioblastoma multiforme promoting aerobic glycolysis rather pyruvate oxidation carried mitochondria (OXPHOS), phenomenon termed Warburg effect, general feature oncogenesis. study, report hypoxia drives expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1) EGFR along hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1alpha human glioblastoma multiforme cells. PDK1 HIF-1-regulated gene findings indicated hypoxia-induced PDK1 expression may promote EGFR activation, initiating feed-forward loop sustain malignant progression. RNAi-mediated attenuation PDK1 EGFR lowered PDK1-EGFR activation decreased HIF-1alpha expression, shifting Warburg phenotype OXPHOS inhibiting glioblastoma multiforme growth proliferation. clinical specimens glioblastoma multiforme, found immunohistochemical expression PDK1, EGFR, HIF-1alpha elevated glioblastoma multiforme specimens compared normal brain tissues. Collectively, studies establish PDK1 key driver candidate therapeutic target glioblastoma multiforme.
