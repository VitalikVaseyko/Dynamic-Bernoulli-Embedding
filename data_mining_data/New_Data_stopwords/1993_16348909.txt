 Eleven strains methanogenic bacteria divided two groups basis directionality (oxidative reductive) citric acid pathways. pathways readily identified methanogens patterns carbon atom labeling glutamate, following growth presence [2-C]acetate. used noncyclic pathways, members family Methanosarcinaceae methanogens found use oxidative direction. Methanococcus jannaschii failed incorporate carbon acetate despite transmembrane equilibration comparable weak acids. organism devoid detectable activities acetate-incorporating enzymes acetyl coenzyme synthetase, acetate kinase, phosphotransacetylase. However, incorporation [1-C]-, [2-C]-, [3-C]pyruvate growth M. jannaschii possible resulted labeling patterns indicative noncyclic citric acid pathway operating reductive direction synthesize amino acids. Carbohydrates labeled consistent glucogenesis pyruvate. Leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, lysine, formate, glycerol, mevalonate incorporated supplied growth medium. Lysine preferentially incorporated lipid fraction, suggesting role phytanyl chain precursor.
