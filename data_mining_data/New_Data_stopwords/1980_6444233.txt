 Abnormal SLE mononuclear cell responses PHA corrected removal adherent mononuclear cells. present study demonstrates cell-free supernatants allogeneic adherent cell cultures inhibit lymphocyte response addition indomethacin cultures partly blocks inhibitory effect resulting supernatant. Supernatants SLE monocyte cultures suppressed allogeneic normal cell responses 36% (response supernatant 33,515 +/- 3814 cpm, media control 51,947 +/- 3173 cpm) normal monocyte culture supernatants suppress (48,384 +/- 4172 vs. 47,477 +/- 3221 cpm). Early (less 24 hr) addition indomethacin monocyte cultures prevented elaboration inhibitory material. normals, indomethacin-treated supernatants strikingly stimulatory (response 178% +/- 24 control), whereas similarly treated supernatants SLE monocyte cultures stimulatory (response 103% +/- 8 control). data indicate soluble inhibitor lymphocyte blastogenesis produced SLE monocytes.
