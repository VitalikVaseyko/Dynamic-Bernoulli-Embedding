 OBJECTIVE: contribution mitochondrial dysfunction skeletal muscle insulin resistance remains elusive. Comparative proteomics applied generate new hypotheses human biology applied isolated mitochondria identify novel changes mitochondrial protein abundance present insulin-resistant muscle. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: Mitochondria isolated vastus lateralis muscle lean insulin-sensitive individuals obese insulin-resistant individuals otherwise healthy. Respiration reactive oxygen species (ROS) production rates measured vitro. Relative abundances proteins detected mass spectrometry determined using normalized spectral abundance factor method. RESULTS: NADH- FADH(2)-linked maximal respiration rates similar lean obese individuals. Rates pyruvate palmitoyl-DL-carnitine (both including malate) ROS production significantly higher obesity. Mitochondria obese individuals maintained higher (more negative) extramitochondrial ATP free energy low metabolic flux, suggesting stronger mitochondrial thermodynamic driving forces may underlie higher ROS production. Tandem mass spectrometry identified protein abundance differences per mitochondrial mass insulin resistance, including lower abundance complex subunits enzymes involved oxidation branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) fatty acids (e.g., carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B). CONCLUSIONS: provide data suggesting normal oxidative capacity mitochondria insulin-resistant skeletal muscle parallel high rates ROS production. Furthermore, show specific abundance differences proteins involved fat BCAA oxidation might contribute accumulation lipid BCAA frequently associated pathogenesis insulin resistance.
