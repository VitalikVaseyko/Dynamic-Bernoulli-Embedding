 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA mitochondria key regulatory enzyme metabolism glucose acetyl-CoA. Phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. four PDK isoforms, expression PDK4 PDK2 genes elevated starvation diabetes, allowing glucose conserved fatty acid oxidation increased. studies investigated transcriptional mechanisms expression PDK4 gene increased. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1alpha) stimulates expression genes involved hepatic gluconeogenesis mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. found PGC-1alpha induce expression PDK2 PDK4 genes primary rat hepatocytes ventricular myocytes. cloned promoter rat PDK4 gene. Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), activates many genes liver, induce PDK4 expression. Although HNF4 PGC-1alpha interact stimulate several genes encoding gluconeogenic enzymes, induction PDK4 involve interactions PGC-1alpha HNF4. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, demonstrated HNF4 PGC-1alpha associated PDK4 gene vivo. data suggest inducing PDK genes PGC-1alpha direct pyruvate away metabolism acetyl-CoA toward formation oxaloacetate gluconeogenic pathway.
