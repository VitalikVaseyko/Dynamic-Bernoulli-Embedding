 important role pyruvate kinase malarial infection prompted cloning cDNA encoding Plasmodium falciparum pyruvate kinase (pfPyrK), using mRNA intraerythrocytic-stage malaria parasites. full-length cDNA encodes protein computed molecular weight 55.6 kDa isoelectric point 7.5. purified recombinant pfPyrK enzymatically active exists homotetramer active form. enzyme exhibits hyperbolic kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate ADP, K(m) 0.19 0.12 mM, respectively. pfPyrK affected fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, general activating factor pyruvate kinase species. Glucose-6-phosphate, activator Toxoplasma gondii enzyme, affect pfPyrK activity. Similar rabbit pyruvate kinase, pfPyrK susceptible inactivation 1mM pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, lesser extent. screen inhibitors pfPyrK revealed markedly inhibited ATP citrate. Detailed kinetic analysis revealed transition hyperbolic sigmoidal kinetics PEP presence citrate, well competitive inhibitory behavior ATP respect PEP. Citrate exhibits non-competitive inhibition respect ADP K(i) 0.8mM. conclusion, P. falciparum expresses active pyruvate kinase intraerythrocytic-stage developmental cycle may play important metabolic roles infection.
