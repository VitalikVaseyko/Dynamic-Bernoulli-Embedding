 16th day gestation three forms pyruvate kinase present foetal rat liver (L, R, M2). Hepatocytes isolated 15-day-old foetuses possess liver form pyruvate kinase, three days culture enzyme detected. effect appearance enzyme could seen administration insulin fructose. Hepatocytes isolated 19-day-old foetuses exhibit three forms enzyme (L, R, M2) day 1 culture thereafter two forms detectable (L M2). decrease activity L form observed. could retarded administration insulin fructose.
