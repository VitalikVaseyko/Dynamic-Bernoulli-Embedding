 Many apicomplexan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii Plasmodium species, possess nonphotosynthetic plastid, referred apicoplast, essential parasites' viability displays characteristics similar nongreen plastids plants. study, localized several key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism T. gondii either apicoplast cytosol engineering parasites express epitope-tagged fusion proteins. cytosol contains complete set enzymes glycolysis, enable parasite metabolize imported glucose pyruvate. glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, present T. gondii genome, duplicates isoforms triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase found localize apicoplast. mRNA expression levels genes glycolytic products compared tachyzoites bradyzoites; however, strict bradyzoite-specific expression pattern observed enolase I. T. gondii genome encodes single pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, located apicoplast absent mitochondrion, shown targeting epitope-tagged fusion proteins immunolocalization native pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. exchange metabolites cytosol apicoplast likely mediated phosphate translocator localized apicoplast. Based localization studies, model proposed explains supply apicoplast ATP reduction power, well exchange metabolites cytosol apicoplast.
