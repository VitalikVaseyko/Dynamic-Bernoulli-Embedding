 ATPase activity actomyosin activity glycogenolytic enzymes distinctly increased postnatal period development. Direct correlation observed actomyosin ATPase phosphofructokinase, phosphohexoisomerase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase "bound" fraction aldolase. Kinetic patterns phosphofructokinase (Km Hill's coefficient) altered postnatal period. Formation complexes contractile proteins glycolytic enzymes appears important development contractile function.
