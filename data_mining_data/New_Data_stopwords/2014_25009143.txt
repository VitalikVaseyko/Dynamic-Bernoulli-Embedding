 UNLABELLED: Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas inoculated OsHV-1 low load (control) high load (challenged) better understand pathogenesis ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1 muVar) determine metabolic pathways might affected infection. Animals sampled proteomic analysis two days post-injection, time OsHV-1 initiated intense replication phase challenged oysters. Twenty-five abundant protein spots showed marked change accumulated levels identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) proteomic approach. Overall, proteins involved cytoskeleton organization, protein turnover, induction stress signals, signalling pathways energy metabolism. Challenged oysters exhibited increased glycolysis VDAC accumulation, reflect "Warburg effect" initially reported cancer cells recently shrimp infected virus. results presented useful identifying potential biomarkers disease resistance developing antiviral measures. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: study first 2-DE proteomic analysis dedicated pathogenesis ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1 muVar) oyster Crassostrea gigas, important bivalve produced world. OsHV-1 affected oysters every year since 2008. proteins identified paper key targets involved OsHV-1 infection processes. presented evidence metabolic changes infection oyster somehow resemble Warburg effect occurring cancer cells. work constitutes real advance comprehension host metabolic pathways affected OsHV-1 disease. Overall, work contributes better understanding disease mortalities aquatic ecosystems could guide management actions mitigate impacts.
